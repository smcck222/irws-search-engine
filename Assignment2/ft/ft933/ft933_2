FT  29 SEP 93 / Survey of Peru (21): Private capital eases the travellers'
ride - Sally Bowen examines infrastructural improvements

SOME OF PERU'S roads, such as the central highway into the heart of the
Andes, are unparalleled feats of engineering. Others, the jungle highway
built by former President Belaunde, for example, represent the triumph of
optimism over reason. Almost without exception, they are excruciatingly
uncomfortable to travel along.
But within the last few months, the Peruvian traveller is starting to see
the occasional stretch of perfectly smooth, uniformly grey asphalt - a
welcome, if brief, respite from the bone-shaking norm.
Peru's highways are finally under repair. Of some 70,000km of roads
throughout the country, just 10 per cent are at present asphalted. In total,
according to transport ministry estimates, only 1,000km of roads throughout
the country are in reasonable condition.
The InterAmerican Development Bank (IADB) is lending Peru Dollars 210m over
four years to help repair trunk roads. The Peruvian government is adding
another Dollars 90m. By December, 440km of the main coastal road, the
Panamerican highway, will be newly surfaced - and by the end of next year,
1,200km will have been completely rehabilitated.
In Peru's rugged interior, in provinces which are still in a state of
emergency because of lingering subversion, road-building is entrusted to
army engineering battalions. The Treasury has been able to budget Dollars
80m this year and Dollars 150m next for repairs to these badly-neglected
highways and for reconstruction of bridges dynamited by Sendero Luminoso
guerrillas during the past few years.
'Road-building is central to the government's strategy of integration,
development and pacification,' says Mr Dante Cordova, minister of transport
and communications. 'The army's doing something productive and at the same
time generating security. It also provides jobs for local people.'
Another loan of Dollars 220m is under negotiation with the World Bank to
rebuild and asphalt roads such as the Huanuco-Tingo Maria-Pucallpa link,
which runs through coca-growing territory. The initiative will help cut
exorbitant transport costs and thus, it is hoped, encourage coca-farmers to
switch to other crops.
It is not only in roads that improvements are now being seen. Deregulation
of ports and airports is bringing welcome benefits to travellers and
exporters.
Peru's ports used to be among the most expensive in the world. But in its
earliest months in government, the Fujimori administration managed to break
a fifty-five year union monopoly on stevedoring, cutting costs by around
three-quarters. More recently, port charges levied by Enapu, the state ports
authority, have undergone cuts of up to 40 per cent.
'Callao, Lima's port, is now one of the most competitively priced in the
world, cheaper than Guayaquil and about the same as Valparaiso,' says Mr
Cordova. 'Ilo and Matarani in the south can now compete on costs with Chile,
while Paita in the north is cheaper than its Ecuadorean rivals.'
Although the process is taking longer than anticipated, privatisation of
port and airport services is under way. Ramps, car-parking, duty-free shops
and restaurant facilities at Lima's Jorge Chavez international airport will
soon all be privately managed under a concession system. Corpac, the
airports authority which has traditionally run these services will be
reduced to a 'technical body, concentrating on air traffic control,' says Mr
Cordova. Meanwhile, small domestic airlines have proliferated and fares have
plummeted.
A special privatisation committee (Cepri) has been appointed to oversee
transfer of Enapu's seven Pacific seaports to the private sector. The
southern port of Ilo is being treated as a special case, with its own Cepri.
Great hopes hang on Ilo. In February last year, Peru signed a historic
agreement with Bolivia, giving its landlocked neighbour access to the sea
via a 'corridor'. Bolivian and Peruvian entrepreneurs will share an
industrial free zone in Ilo, while the Bolivians also now have rights to a
strip of Peruvian coast known as Boliviamar, which is slated to become a
popular seaside resort.
The Peruvian gesture is aimed at capturing the lion's share of Bolivia's
import and export trade, which currently brings in some 500,000 tonnes of
merchandise a year via the northern Chilean port of Arica. The plan depends
on the upgrading of the La Paz-Ilo road link. A team of engineers from South
Korea's Daewoo Corporation is already completing an initial study for the
road, which Peru's transport ministry expects to cost around Dollars 120m.
Even a cursory glance at the map reveals the strategic potential of a port
such as Ilo. The Fujimori administration would like to see it - or
neighbouring Matarani - become the gateway between Asia and Latin America.
More ambitious, and still very much at the drawing-board stage, is a plan
for a transcontinental highway linking Ilo with the Brazilian Atlantic port
of Santos.
The economic arguments for such a road are powerful. Brazil's soya,
concentrated in south-western Acre province near the Peruvian border, must
currently be transported some 4,000km for shipping from the Atlantic ports '
it is only 1,300km to Ilo. The cost of exporting Brazilian soya to Asia via
Peru would, says Mr Arturo Ramirez of the Cepri-Ilo, result in savings of
Dollars 23 per ton, or Dollars 500,000 on an average boatload.
With only minor improvements, Ilo could handle huge increases in trade -
currently under 12 per cent of port capacity is being used. The sell-off of
the state-owned Ilo copper refinery late this year, and forthcoming
development of the recently-privatised Quellaveco mine to the east of Ilo
could also boost total shipments.
The Dutch company Haskoning is presently completing a study on Ilo's
privatisation. Once evaluation is complete, a promoter will be contracted
and the port concession put up for international tender in March 1994.
This will be the pattern for future privatisations of infrastructure. New
Peruvian investment laws throw concessions for any of the country's roads,
ports and airports open to private bidders.
This could be the way ahead for the transcontinental highway. If
international organisations will not put up the estimated Dollars 1.4bn
required, 'maybe private Brazilian consortia will bid for a 60-year
concession and operate it as a toll-road,' says Mr Cordova. 'We're working
on stretches of it already, but Brazil will be the biggest beneficiary.'

FT  29 SEP 93 / Survey of Peru (22): Task for foreign funders / A look at
basic services
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEDRO-PABLO KUCZYNSKI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NO MAIN Latin American country fell further in the 1980s than Peru. Like the
others, Peru suffered from the debt crisis - low prices for its commodity
exports combined with high real dollar interest rates on its bloated
external debt.
Its problem was made much worse, however, by the incredible economic
incompetence of the Alan Garcia administration 1985-90, and by an ever
increasing campaign of terrorism with which neither the Belaunde nor the
Garcia governments were able to cope. Peru which today and 10 years ago had
5 per cent of the Latin American population has over the same period seen
its share of the regional GNP fall from 4.4 per cent to 3.4 per cent, as
real GNP fell by 115 per cent.
Today as Peru turns the economic corner, the Fujimori administration has to
cope with the past drastic deterioration in public services that accompanied
economic decline. The answer for telephones, electricity, and ports is no
doubt privatisation but other services are a more complicated issue.
Peru has one of the highest infant mortality rates in Latin America (69 per
1,000 live births, only exceeded by Bolivia, Guatemala and Haiti), the
result of poverty and a very poor water and sewerage system. Illiteracy is
also high, exceeded only by the same three countries, plus Brazil.
In basic services the government is wisely acting to privatise public
electricity and telephones. The public grid had a capacity of only about
4000MW, slightly more than 11 years ago. In the meantime, poor maintenance,
disastrous utility tariff policies in the period 1985-90, an over-reliance
on hydropower in the drought-prone Andes, as well as frequent terrorist
actions against long-distance transmission lines in isolated areas, have
meant huge costs for industry and inconvenience for households.
Probably 1 1/2 -2 per cent of GNP was lost in 1991 - to apagones (blackouts)
and electricity rationing, but the problems continue in 1993. In the Lima
area, ElectroLima estimates that 25 per cent of demand in the second half of
1993 will have to be rationed, compared with almost 30 per cent a year
earlier. The electricity privatisations are scheduled for a year from now.
They should be accelerated as quickly as possible so that the new steam
plants on the drawing board can get financed and built.
The telephone system with only three lines per 100 inhabitants is to be
privatised in the next three months. The privatisers would be wise to give
the new owners a decent interval before allowing competition so that the
badly needed pre-approved investment programme can be properly financed.
Ports should also be privatised as well as water systems for the main four
or five cities, where supplies reach only half their target population. This
will provide the government with the resources to tackle the huge water and
sewerage deficit in provincial areas.
The road system has been badly affected by years of terrorism, banditry, and
neglect of maintenance. The central highway, the link to the main mining and
farming regions of the central Andes has been inaugurated time after time
with international agency loans: it is at present near collapse. For the
main roads a mixture of partial privatisation, tolls and user charges is the
only answer. Improvements to other roads are equally urgent, but have to
rely on government money.
The choices in health and education are more complex. Industrial countries
themselves, the US especially, are wrestling with how to deliver costly
social services. As government tax revenues improve - they have reached 11
per cent of GNP compared with less than half that at the end of the Garcia
administration in 1990 - the public sector will be in a position to do more,
although it should rely on private co-operation and incentives where it can
as has happened in Chile.
Where will the money come from? Obviously public utilities have to generate
enough cash, which they are beginning to do after tariff adjustments in
1990-Pounds 91. Privatisation will force more economical investments,
especially in electricity, where over-reliance in the 1970s on marginal and
therefore expensive hydro schemes burdens the system. Beyond the cash flow
and parsimony, finance will have to come from equity and borrowings.
The stock market which has tripled in market captilisation to about Dollars
4.5bn in the last 18 months, will in time be able to provide some equity
capital and blue chips such as the telephone companies, which will be under
one financial roof after privatisation, will be able to access foreign
equity for their expansion, instead of foreign investors simply acquiring
undervalued assets as happens now.
Water and electricity will need funding from the Washington institutions,
especially the International Finance Corporation (IFC) and the InterAmerican
Development Bank (IADB). The IFC has the advantage over its parent the World
Bank of lending dollars instead of yen and not requiring international
competitive bidding down to the last screw, a process that often raises the
cost of projects rather than reducing it, as is the intention. It is
expanding to infrastructure lending in Latin America as its big brother
looks more and more to central and eastern Europe. Earlier this year, an
international group recommended to the IADB the allocation of at leat 5 per
cent of new lending for privatised infrastructure.
Leveraging this limited money with proper performance safeguards from
governments on utility tariffs and exchange convertibility, the IADB ought
to be able to mobilise sizeable funds. If utility privatisation forges ahead
the fund should have plenty to do in this re-emerging economy.

American industrial holding company, and a former Peruvian minister of

FT  29 SEP 93 / Survey of Peru (20): Pensions chain 'helps to create new
jobs' / A look at the new private funds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID PILLING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PERUVIANS intent on visiting the central Lima office of Integra, one of the
country's eight new private pension funds, are obliged to press their way
past a thicket of street hawkers, shoeshine boys, newspaper vendors and
makeshift food stalls. These members of Peru's black economy, the so-called
'informals', are one of the biggest obstacles in the path of the government
as it tries to set up a national private pension scheme.
Unlike Chile, which established its successful system in 1981, Peru has had
to design its scheme in the knowledge that most of its population, many of
them slum-dwellers or peasants living high on the Andean plains, are beyond
the reach of pension funds, private or otherwise.
Mr Jaime Caceres, executive president of Integra, agrees that Peru's scheme
is not, at least at first, likely to be as all-embracing as that of Chile,
which obliges all workers to pay 10 per cent of their salary into private
pension funds, or AFPs. Nevertheless, he argues, the 2m Peruvians who are
now being encouraged to swap from state to private pensions should provide a
large enough base for the new system to take off.
Between the end of June, when the AFPs began to operate, and mid-September,
a total of 275,000 people switched to the new funds, according to Mr Augusto
Mouchard, the AFP superintendent. Many of these had lost their faith in the
near-bankrupt state system, which provides pensioners with a pittance in
return for a lifetime's contributions. It has been estimated that the state
scheme, which should hold Dollars 14bn, has been left with only Dollars 350m
after years of hyperinflation and government diversion of funds. Mr Mouchard
expects 600,000 to 800,000 people to join an AFP in the first 12 months,
investing funds of at least Dollars 200m. In five years, he says, AFPs could
control Dollars 2-3bn.
The hope is that these funds will kick-start Peru's underdeveloped capital
markets, providing much-needed cash for struggling industry. Chilean pension
funds, which have amassed more than Dollars 12bn in a decade, have provided
a stable institutional base that has triggered tremendous growth in the size
and sophistication of the domestic market.
'There is a simple chain,' says Mr Caceres. 'New funds lead to new
investments which help to create new jobs. This, in turn, produces more
funds.' The AFPs, he argues, will play a crucial role in 'reactivating the
economy'.
Mr Mouchard agrees that, as AFP resources grow, their investments will have
a snowball effect. He expects the system to begin to draw in people
currently outside the formal economy. 'This is a way of formalisation,' he
says.
The process will not be easy. An impediment is likely to be a shortage of
investment opportunities for new institutions in a country with a small,
volatile stock market and few investment vehicles such as corporate bonds.
Only weeks after the AFPs began to operate, the government was forced to
change investment limits - raising that of fixed term bank deposits to 60
per cent - because of a lack of alternatives.
A commission, set up to assess the risk of corporate bonds and stocks, had
not started work by August, forcing the government to restrict these types
of investment.
Mr Mouchard insists that the new limits, brought in for 60 days, are only
temporary. He believes that the presence of institutional funds will create
the impetus for investment opportunities. 'Above all, the AFPs will provide
the stability that any emerging market needs,' he says.
'Most of the large companies in Peru are getting ready to issue bonds,' says
Mr Caceres. 'In time, there will be more financial instruments to buy.' He
is not alarmed at the current paucity of investment opportunities. 'Our
funds are going to grow little by little so we don't need everything in
place today.'
The AFPs, whose number is likely to rise as professionals such as teachers
and engineers establish their own funds, are strictly regulated. Mr Caceres
says he must supply daily details of investments to the superintendent.
Pension fund contributions must be kept totally separate from the running
costs of the business. The superintendent even has the right to screen AFP
advertisements before transmission.
The Peruvian state will not guarantee minimum benefits, unlike in Chile,
where private pensions that fall short of an agreed level are topped up by
the government. However, AFPs whose performance is well below the average of
other institutions will be forced to make up the difference from their own
reserves.
No Peruvian will be obliged to opt out of the state pension system which the
government has promised to maintain. Those who do, however, will be rewarded
with a state bond, calculated according to age and recent earnings, and a
one-off pay rise.
Peru's scheme is attracting much international interest, with companies such
as Aetna and Citibank of the US and the Dutch insurance group ING taking out
stakes in AFPs. All eight private pension funds have had input from Chilean
counterparts.
'Every day more and more people are convincing themselves that, whatever the
risks, they will lose nothing by leaving the state system,' says Mr Caceres.
However, even he is cautious of making long-term predictions. 'No-one in
this country can tell you what's going to happen in 10 years. It all depends
on the development of the economy in general.'

FT  29 SEP 93 / Survey of Peru (19): Practical visionary / Profile of
Hernando de Soto
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHANGES have started to happen in Peru since the mid-1980s, when Mr Hernando
de Soto published one of the most influential works on political economy
ever to emerge from Latin America - but not influential enough for de Soto's
liking.
De Soto has demonstrated the power of the word. His book excoriated the
authoritarianism and the corruption of government in Peru, but its name, The
Other Path, together with its message, threw down the gauntlet in the
direction of Shining Path, the brutal Maoist revolutionary movement which
threatened the Peruvian state. One evening in July last year, as de Soto sat
in his office in Lima's Miraflores district, Shining Path tried and to blow
him and his organisation, the Institute of Liberty and Democracy (ILD) out
of existence with a 400kg car bomb. The attempt failed.
De Soto's achievement was to see, in Lima's teeming millions of hawkers and
hustlers, not the dubious activities of marginals but the great mainstream
of history.
He examined the consequences of the migration from country to cities over
the last 40 years, which has quintupled Peru's urban population. Drawing
parallels with the emergence of capitalism in Europe in the 19th century, de
Soto described Peru as a mercantilist state in which most participants in
the formal economy were concerned not with the creation of wealth but rather
with the extraction of favours from government.
This mercantilist system, bolstered by governments of both the left and the
right in Peru, resulted in thousands of regulations which effectively forced
most of the new migrants to work outside the formal economy.
Yet it was a mistake to see only chaos in the shanty towns around Lima:
internal rules were established; rights over property were often recognised,
and a system of security established. De Soto estimates that there are 30
informal banking systems in the country.
From an economic standpoint, the problem with this is that it is
tremendously inefficient. To use de Soto's metaphor, it condemns individuals
to an existence in small pools. By bringing these people into the formal
economy by means of big deregulation, they will be able to join the river.
Thus one of the book's central messages was a plea to unleash the energy of
the informal sector by abandoning the mercantilist approach which has linked
government with the private sector in Peru for so long. The informal system
'shows us that what Peruvians want, first and foremost, is firm property
rights, reliable transactions and secure activities.'
De Soto estimates that 92 per cent of all rural land holdings in Peru are
not in the formal economy sector. Similarly, 60 per cent of urban land
holdings are untitled. Land makes up 80 per cent of the assets of all
Peruvians - and more than 90 per cent of the assets of the poor. De Soto
argues that being able to establish formal title over property is the key to
prosperity, as it was in Britain in the second half of the 19th century.
If things have begun to change since he wrote his book, it is partly because
de Soto's organisation is pursuing land titling. Using simple forms and
computers, some 100,000 land titles have been registered in the last 15
months.
While this is only a start, De Soto says the titling has been done more
quickly and much more cheaply (Dollars 8 per title) than in similar
exercises elsewhere in Latin America. Only 5 per cent of claims have been
the subject of dispute.
In zones where the ILD have carried out titling campaigns, the price of
property has doubled immediately, and should continue to rise over time. He
says that terrorists have moved out (although not necessarily their
political organisations) and the level of violence has fallen. And banks
have moved in - because the titles provide physical evidence of ownership
and security for lenders.
Another practical consequence of The Other Path has been the successful
campaign to bring the thousands of companies operating in the informal
sector into the formal sector, through cheap and quick registration
procedures. As an example for the book, ILD's researchers, in the summer of
1983, had attempted to establish an imaginary clothing factory - legally. It
took a group of them 289 days of full-time labour. It cost Dollars 1,231,
including expenses and lost income; the equivalent of 32 minimum monthly
wages. Bribes were solicited on 10 occasions, but only two were paid.
Setting up a street kiosk required 43 days and Dollars 590.
Now the procedures require one day and the payment of a small fee. Although
moving into the formal sector brings the risk of having to pay taxes, says
de Soto, it allows small entrepreneurs to avoid paying bribes and, for
example, to advertise their existence to potential new customers. As daily
lines for registration continue to form outside the ministry of industry,
the number of businesses being registered has grown from 2,000 a month in
1990 to 11,000 a month now.
But if these have been modest successes for de Soto, there have been
setbacks. He was formerly President Alberto Fujimori's special adviser on
drugs; he resigned last year, frustrated at the lack of progress of his
plans. He had brought together 182 local leaders from the remote areas where
coca, the raw material for producing cocaine, is grown. The idea was to
drive a wedge between the traffickers, who would continue to be hunted, and
the growers, who would not be touched. After Mr Fujimori's auto-golpe on
April 5 last year, however, de Soto's plans began to run into the sand.
If he is less than sanguine about the long-term impact of the drugs trade on
those areas of the country where 1.6m people earn a living from the coca
plant, he credits the Fujimori government with making progress on the
economic front and introducing some deregulation.
He favours privatisation of inefficient state enterprises - a policy the
government is pursuing aggressively.
Yet while change has begun, most Peruvians have not noticed it.
'Deregulation has taken place at the top; yet there has been little or no
deregulation at the level of the poor,' de Soto says.

FT  29 SEP 93 / Survey of Peru (17): Mining giant survived the economic
cave-in - US-owned SPCC, which produces two thirds of Peru's copper,
welcomes the new business climate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SALLY BOWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
US-owned Southern Peru Copper Corporation is far and away the country's
largest private company, responsible for two-thirds of all national copper
output. SPCC is Peruvian mining's great survivor. Mr Charles Preble, SPCC's
president, has seen it all since he arrived in Peru 28 years ago.
'In 1965 there were 12 foreign-owned mining companies, a host of small and
medium-sized mines and plenty of exploration going on here,' he says. 'By
July 1990, no one was exploring, there were just two foreign mining concerns
left, while most of the small and many medium-sized mines had shut down.'
SPCC escaped the nationalistic zeal of General Velasco's military government
in the 1970s, probably because of the huge upcoming investment in its second
open-cast mine, Cuajone. Financing for the venture involved 53 international
banks, who would have pulled out had nationalisation been threatened.
According to Mr Preble, however, it was during the 1985-90 presidency of
Alan Garcia that conditions hit rock bottom. Hyperinflation, restrictions on
profit remittances and a bloated state bureaucracy meant adverse conditions
for all businesses, but the mining industry was also used as a 'milk cow' in
the state's ever more desperate hunt for tax revenue.
Top of Mr Preble's list of improvements under the Fujimori administration is
the liberalisation of foreign exchange. 'This affects everybody, of course,
not just the mining sector, but it's a big factor. Anyone looking for
financing is going to have to be able to assure the institution he's dealing
with that foreign exchange will be available. Opening an escrow account -
which most financial institutions are going to require to insure loan
repayment - is also now possible.'
Until the Fujimori government slashed import tariffs, SPCC calculates that
almost half of total cost of sales went in taxes. That has now 'decreased
somewhat', with a positive effect on overall costs, says Mr Preble. Last
year's sales topped Dollars 635m, with profits totalling Dollars 94m.
The biggest remaining obstacle to mining sector expansion is the exchange
rate. Peru's sol remains heavily overvalued and this year's predicted gains
in parity have not materialised. Miners would also like to see a further
reduction in the inflation rate, although the current two per cent to three
per cent a month is a great improvement on two years ago.
The labour panorama, too, has improved immeasurably. 'For unions to strike
now, they must win over 50 per cent support in a publicly-supervised secret
vote,' says Mr Preble. 'That's a tremendous change. For the last 25 or 30
years, less than five per cent of the labour force could call a strike.'
Barring a two-day 'blip', SPCC has had no strikes since mid-1990. About 95
per cent of company workers have signed individual 'labour peace' agreements
with the company, giving them bonuses for uninterrupted production. And SPCC
management has recently signed a three-year contract with its employees:
'Probably the first time that's ever been done in Peruvian labour history,'
says Mr John Youle, SPCC's vice-president.
In late 1991, SPCC committed itself to fresh investments worth Dollars 300m
for expansion of refined copper output and environmental improvements. The
Dollars 90m capture acid plant for the Ilo smelter is now in the second
phase of engineering and on target for completion by May 1995. A sewage
treatment plant for Ilo town is three-quarters finished, while the basic
engineering phase for electrowinning (copper-recovery) plants at Toquepala
and Cuajone mines is now finished. Feasibility studies for a new tailings
disposal system are also nearing completion.
The new investment should allow SPCC, under last year's mining law, to sign
a tax stability agreement with the government - a facility now available to
any company investing over Dollars 2m.
SPCC is among those bidding for the Mineroperu-owned copper refinery at Ilo,
scheduled for privatisation late this year. Under a tolling contract with
the government, SPCC must keep the state-owned refinery supplied with
blister copper. Potential rival bidders include Japan's Mitsui, Montagu
Mining in association with Britain's Midland Bank, and a consortium which
includes Chile's Pudahuel mining company.
SPCC says it welcomes the prospect of more foreign mining companies in Peru.
The inauguration last month of Newmont Mining's gold-mining operation in
Cajamarca is an encouraging sign, says Mr Preble. So is the fact that there
are now geologists 'all over the hills - so many of them it's like a big old
tea-party when they get together.'
'All this is not just because Peru's got attractive rocks,' Mr Preble says.
'It's because of the new, positive investment environment.'

FT  29 SEP 93 / Survey of Peru (18): A mutually beneficial link with China /
Profile of Hierro Peru
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SALLY BOWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A STUNNED silence descended on the makeshift auction room in Lima's mines
ministry when privatisation officials announced the winning bid for Hierro
Peru, the ailing iron producer, last November.
The Shougang Corporation of the People's Republic of China had offered
almost six times the base price. Adding in long-standing company debts and a
Dollars 150m investment commitment, the Chinese were paying about Dollars
312m for an operation most observers considered ready for the scrap-heap.
Reactions varied from the incredulity of rival bidders (a consortium of
prominent Chilean, Japanese and Mexican steel producers) to the nervousness
of Peruvian economic liberals.
It was hardly appropriate, they felt, for the first big sell-off to go to
communist buyers. Others were convinced that the Chinese had got their sums
wrong, and had failed to appreciate the disastrous state of the company.
'Absolutely untrue,' says a senior Shougang official. 'We knew exactly what
we were buying, all the problems. It was a question of opportunity cost.
China needs iron and here we could buy a deposit with huge reserves and an
immediate outlet to the sea. Few iron mines in the world can compare with
Marcona.'
Now, nine months after taking control of their new investment, Shougang
managers are happy. A Dollars 35m loss in 1992 has already turned into a
small profit.
Output in the first half of 1993 was two and a half times higher than the
same period last year, although, at 2.43m long tons of concentrate, still
well below current installed capacity.
Productivity figures have improved sharply - from 156 tonnes per worker per
month last year to 325 tonnes now. Production costs have been slashed by 60
per cent in six months, partly as a result of workforce reductions - from
3,300 to 1,700. Shipments are leaving on time. Equipment and administrative
systems are being overhauled.
It is a sharp about-turn in Hierro Peru's fortunes. From 1953 until its
expropriation by the Peruvian state in 1972, the rich deposits were the
property of the US-owned Marcona Mining Company. Since then, under first
military, then civilian governments, output and installed capacity both
inexorably declined.
Output peaked in 1970, when 9.7m tonnes of concentrates were produced,
mostly shipped to Asian buyers. By 1990, it had slumped by more than
two-thirds.
Shougang has already embarked on new investment - in the second half of 1993
it will top Dollars 37m. Much will go on new shovels and drills for the
mine, rebuilding stocks of essential spare parts and a modern communications
system. Wharf facilities at the deep water port of San Nicolas (one of the
best on the Pacific coast of Latin America, and an important company asset)
are being upgraded.
Future plans are ambitious. They include raising output to 5m long tons this
year, to 7.5m next year; 10m by 1995. Total investment of around Dollars
150m will be needed to expand current installed capacity. Low-profile
company officials are reluctant to reveal longer-term plans, although there
is talk of constructing a steel plant on site and, later, a factory to
manufacture Chinese-designed tractors for export to other Latin American
countries.
Shougang could also be interested in buying Siderperu, the state-owned
steelworks and, eventually, developing the country's other big iron deposits
of Huancabamba, in the eastern jungle. There is good news, too, on the
labour front. Workers who survived the swingeing job cuts appear to have
adapted swiftly to their new Chinese managers.
'After the long, no-hope years of falling production, we're glad to be in
work,' said one local miner. Colleagues agreed, praising initiatives such as
a new consumer co-operative which offers basic goods to workers at cost.
Shougang seems bent on bringing self-sufficiency to the 23,000-inhabitant
community of San Juan de Marcona, off the beaten track and traditionally
dependent on the Hierro Peru operation.
Two small trawlers have been imported from China to provide fresh fish for
locals and agricultural and livestock projects are under way. Company
officials say these small beginnings could lead to export ventures in
fishmeal (China is Peru's big customer) and agro-industrial products,
probably asparagus.
At present, all the evidence suggests that the Shougang venture is a success
for both Peru and its Chinese purchasers. 'We're really just like any
Western industrial company in that we want to make profits,' says a senior
Shougang official. 'But perhaps our great respect for our human resources is
a peculiarity. It is certainly fundamental for Shougang.'

FT  29 SEP 93 / Survey of Peru (12): Foreigners lured to the mines - The
mineral wealth of Peru accounts for about half the country's export revenue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID PILLING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE HAS never been any doubt about the mineral wealth of Peru.
The country is streaked with enormous deposits of copper, iron, zinc, gold
and silver, and its mines account for about half of the export revenue. But
what foreigners have found doubtful is the wisdom of investing in Peru,
given the country's recent history of state intervention, economic
instability and terrorist attacks.
That may be changing. A new mining code, more promising economic indicators
and improved internal security are beginning to generate real interest in
Peruvian mining. Multinationals, spurred on by the forthcoming privatisation
of some of Peru's most promising mines, are for the first time in years
seriously considering new investments.
'Mining groups are more used to risk than other industries,' says one
western diplomat. 'They have to invest where the mines are. Everybody has
known for years that Peru has fantastic resources. They've just all been
waiting.'
For some companies, the wait is over.
Last November, China's Shougang Corporation committed Dollars 312m to
purchase state iron producer Hierro Peru. In August of this year, a
consortium of Newmont Mining of Denver, BRGM of France and Peru's
Buenaventura group saw its Yanacocha goldmine begin production. The mine,
which has estimated reserves of 800,000 troy ounces, is likely to repay its
initial investment of Dollars 34m in a matter of months.
Multinational companies, cautious for years about Peru's seeming antagonism
to foreign investment, have been heartened by last year's mining code which
puts foreign groups on an equal footing with their counterparts in Peru.
Investors have been assured of full legal rights over mining property,
freedom to market their own products, a stable tax environment and the
immediate repatriation of profits.
The package proved sufficiently attractive for Anglo American of South
Africa which, through its Chilean subsidiary Mantos Blancos, last year
bought the unexploited Quellaveco copper deposit with about 250,000 tonnes
of reserves. The Dollars 12m paid by Anglo American, far below international
prices for a mine of Quellaveco's size, highlights the bargains that Peru
can offer investors willing to gamble.
Mining groups appear to have taken note. A total of 19 foreign companies,
including US, Canadian and Japanese, have pre-qualified to bid for the Cerro
Verde copper mine, slated for sale on October 13. The government has set a
minimum price of Dollars 30m in cash and Dollars 60m in pledged investment
for the deposits, which have proven reserves of 800m tonnes, averaging 0.68
per cent of copper.
You do not need to look beyond Cerro Verde, which largely exhausted its
oxide deposits in 1985, to understand why many state-employed engineers
welcome privatisation.
Its output has dropped markedly over recent years, because the concentrator
plant needed to treat secondary sulphides remains unbuilt for lack of cash.
The mining industry has for years been held back by shortcomings in
technology and exploration. It is estimated that only about 10 per cent of
the country's mining potential is being exploited.
Minero Peru, the state's second-largest mining company which owns Cerro
Verde, is also auctioning off its Japanese-built copper refinery at Ilo,
which has the capacity to process 190,000 tonnes of blister a year, and its
zinc refinery at Cajamarquilla, east of Lima. The state has assumed
responsibility for about Dollars 425m of Minero Peru's debts.
The government hopes to raise Dollars 400m from the sale of the three units,
though price may not be the prime concern. 'The fact of obtaining money from
the sale is complementary to the fundamental aim of restructuring the
state,' says Mr Daniel Hokama,the mining and energy minister.
The bellwether of Peru's mining reform may prove the attempted sale of
Centromin, the largest state-owned mining and refinery concern, for which
bids are due on December 10.
The government will announce the minimum price and required investment
levels in November.
Against initial advice, the state has persisted in its strategy of selling
Centromin - which consists of seven mines, a metallurgical complex and four
hydro-electric plants, not to mention railroad track, houses, hospitals and
schools - as a single unit. 'We are pretty sure that it will be sold off as
a single unit,' says Mr Hokama.
According to Coopers and Lybrand, the firm of accountants which is promoting
the sale in conjunction with Chase Manhattan, 25 companies have
pre-qualified to bid. Three to five are expected to bid individually, with
the possibility of an offer from at least one consortium.
Centromin, which last year had a turnover of Dollars 400m, is tentatively
valued at Dollars 300m-500m, though the government may well place more
emphasis on investment pledges.
Whether debt paper will be accepted in partial payment has not yet been
resolved. Mr Hokama says that this would 'help us tremendously', but
President Alberto Fujimori has displayed a strong leaning towards 'cash
money'.
Centromin has seen a significant improvement in its recent performance.
The group, for years hampered by debts, a high exchange rate, labour unrest
and terrorist attacks, posted a small profit last year after losing Dollars
174m in 1991. Gains were largely the result of cuts in the workforce - from
19,000 in 1991 to about 12,000 currently - as well as a more realistic
exchange rate and greater quality control.
Attempts to pull off the same turnaround at other mines have had mixed
fortunes, says Mr Hokama. Managers have often not had enough cash to pay off
workers to cut costs. Stricter lending criteria and the scrapping of the
state mining development bank have made borrowing more difficult.
Nevertheless, foreign interest remains strong. Other mineral resources up
for grabs include a gold deposit at San Antonio de Poto, the Tintaya copper
mine (which last year became Peru's third largest) and medium-sized copper
deposits at Michiquillay and La Granja.
The feeling among some foreign mining executives is that security concerns
and the uncertain political outlook make Peru a risky proposition. But, as
the country's mineral potential attracts growing interest, many believe that
to delay too long and risk losing out on the best mining prospects may be
the greatest risk of all.

FT  29 SEP 93 / Survey of Peru (13): Oil industry revives - Liberalised
petrol prices help investment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID PILLING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RUSTING PIPES, broken-down pumps and disintegrating infrastructure have for
years been the physical signs of Peru's declining oil industry. From the
eastern jungles to the coastal desert of the north-west it is a picture of
decay. Production dwindled from a peak of 71.4m barrels in 1980 to below 40m
barrels in 1991, and proven reserves slumped from 900m barrels to less than
400m.
But, as in the mining sector, there are signs of a reversal of fortunes.
Production of crude petroleum rose one per cent last year to 115,000 b/d,
and the government expects a rise of about 10 per cent in 1993 to 127,000
b/d, or 46.5m barrels over the year.
Much of that results from increased production at Occidental Petroleum of
the US, which has recently committed itself to investing more than Dollars
30m in new exploration after settlement of a long-running payments dispute
with state-owned oil concern Petro Peru.
The financial situation of Petro Peru itself has been made healthier by the
August 1990 liberalisation of petrol prices, which has provided a greater
profit incentive for investment in maintenance and exploration for new
reserves. Eventually the government intends to privatise the state group,
which may be split into as many as 40 operating units.
Changing attitudes to the petroleum industry have been consolidated in a new
hydrocarbons law which seeks to make Peru more attractive to foreign
investors. Companies, whose exploration and production contracts will be on
a surer footing, will market their oil output as they see fit. Restrictions
on exploring within 30 miles of Peruvian frontiers have also been lifted.
'The new law is very sound,' says Mr Roger Alderson, general manager at
Great Western Resources of Houston. 'It simplifies the old regulations,
replacing 33 separate statutes. Now, probably for the first time ever,
Peruvians have accepted that they need foreign investment.'
It looks as though new attitudes may pay off. Peru, which has drilled only
eight wells in the past two years against 100 in Argentina, is witnessing
increased exploration.
Great Western has committed Dollars 40m over four years to explore 1m
hectares in the jungle, while American International Petroleum is spending
at least Dollars 12m over two years on offshore drilling. Mobil Oil is
currently undertaking technical evaluation of the Madre de Dios region in
the southern jungle. Mr Alderson expects significant discoveries in the next
few years which, he says, could easily see the restoration of 1980 output
levels.
There is also renewed interest in the enormous Camisea gas field in Cuzco,
which has estimated reserves equivalent to 2bn barrels of oil, plus 700m
barrels of condensates. Shell, which abandoned plans to develop the resource
in 1988 after failure to agree terms with the Garcia government, is reported
to be looking at the project again.
It is estimated that Camisea would require investment of Dollars 1.8bn to
harness its full potential, though it might be possible to phase in
production with initial sales to the local market.
In the hydrocarbons sector generally, smaller petroleum companies have so
far shown more interest in Peruvian investments than their larger
counterparts, a pattern seen in neighbouring Colombia. However, in an annual
survey of international oil companies conducted earlier this year by Simon
Petroleum Technology, Peru jumped to 17th on the world list of attractive
investment propositions. Three years ago it stood at 37.
Mr Alderson believes it could climb as high as eighth by next year.
'There used to be - and still is to a certain extent - enormous trepidation
about coming to Peru,' he says. 'But now it appears that the country is
turning the corner.'

FT  29 SEP 93 / Survey of Peru (11): Jungle villages drawn into war
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SALLY BOWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SENDERO'S biggest recent action - which attracted only a fraction of the
international attention caused by last July's car-bomb in a Lima suburb -
was aimed at a series of villages in Peru's central jungle. More than 60
peasant farmers and Ashaninka Indians, including women and children, were
hacked to pieces by a Sendero column.
One of the most troubling aspects of the August 18 Mazamari-Puerto Ocopa
killings is that Ashaninkas, the most populous of Peru's 64 Amazonian
tribes, were among both the victims and the aggressors. For several years
past, Sendero has been recruiting Ashaninkas to swell its fighting forces.
Estimates of the numbers of Ashaninka in Peru vary from 50,000 to 80,000.
Most live in the valleys of the Tambo and Ene rivers in Peru's eastern
jungle where the illegal coca trade flourishes. Essentially peace-loving,
they have allowed colonos to settle on adjoining lands.
But in recent years, Sendero has entered Ashaninka territory, running drugs
protection rackets and taking hostage men, women and children to fight and
labour for them. The children are indoctrinated in Sendero-run 'popular
schools',reciting Marxist-Leninist-Maoist slogans.
CAAP, Peru's centre for applied anthropology, estimates that 10,000
Ashaninkas are currently held captive by Sendero. Army patrols, often
Ashaninka-assisted, periodically rescue some of those lured or forced into
joining the guerrilla war against the Peruvian state.
In one jungle town, Puerto Bermudez, Ashaninkas have established their own
army. Their weapons are primarily bows and arrows but the government has
also distributed hunting rifles to help them defend their territory against
Sendero. President Fujimori appears to be supporting Ashaninka calls for
more native battalions and has promised a new airport on the eastern front
of Ashaninka territory.
If subversive activity is in sharp decline in the capital, victory in Peru's
remote jungle looks still to be a long way off.

FT  29 SEP 93 / Survey of Peru (10): Defeated parties prove resilient -
'Pendularity' is an issue, but Mirko Lauer reports that the weak political
spot is the economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MIRKO LAUER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR Peruvians in business nowadays there seems to be but one issue in local
politics: how to avoid 'pendularity'.
This is the local word which refers to the return of the political parties
defeated by Mr Alberto Fujimori in the 1990 elections and then ousted by him
from Congress in his April 1992 coup.
The parties are Accion Popular and Partido Popular Cristiano, on the right;
the Social-democratic Apra party; and an archipelago of leftist parties.
Business interests in Peru fear that any combination of these parties in
power would mean an end to Mr Fujimori's neo-liberal economic policies and
the return of high inflation, subsidies and foreign exchange controls - or
protectionism. There is also the question of whether the parties can provide
political stability, economic efficiency, and the will to fight what will
remain a bloody war against the remnants of Sendero Luminoso's (Shining
Path's) 5,000-strong guerrilla army on the field.
And yet there is a widespread feeling that Mr Fujimori's authoritarian style
of government cannot run for long without increasing strong-arm tactics
(something international pressure presently impedes) or without considerable
doses of popularity (something his economic policies are starting to erode).
The very idea that ex-President Alan Garcia (1985-1990), the exiled leader
of the Apra party, whose administration swamped Peru in hyperinflation,
could once again rule the country, led Peru's businessmen to support Mr
Fujimori's April 1992 coup against Congress.
Sixteen months after the coup Mr Fujimori is still railing against the
politicians, but the message has lost most of its bite.
Unpopular as they now are, the parties and their leaders are proving
resilient. Keeping them at bay in a low intensity democracy such as Mr
Fujimori's is proving unhealthy for the country's political stability.
Preventing pendularity has meant a freer hand for the Peruvian military  -
and, consequently, persistent violations of human rights.
Most opposition leaders, with the exception of Mr Garcia, a staunch critic
of neo-liberal policies, have so far expressed the need to maintain Mr
Fujimore's economic reform programme.
But this has not held them back from giving Mr Fujimori a bumpy political
ride since his coup. The worst of the bumps so far have come from outside
Peru, in the form of international pressure on the subject of human rights.
An attempted coup last November 13 (the first for 18 years) and a good
showing of the parties in the past January's municipal elections have
reminded everyone that the pillars of Mr Fujimori's power - control of the
army and success in the popularity polls - are not quite the democratic
stability he claims for his regime.
Mr Fujimori's contribution to the fight against pendularity is to seek
re-election. First, he needs to win the coming October 31 constitutional
referendum.
His closest backers, especially the actual and potential buyers in the
country's privatisation drive, will not hear about Mr Fujimori leaving his
post in 1995. According to congressman Mr Victor Joy Way, China's Shougang
Corporation (so far, Peru's most important new foreign investor) has pressed
him to run for re-election.
Stability has become identified with Mr Fujimori's permanence. This, of
course, is the classic dictatorial scenario, implying that any pressure for
more democracy inevitably appears to threaten stability.
Because there exists the idea that pendularity may be in the hearts of an
impoverished and expectant population, and that sooner or later the fickle
Peruvian electoral mood will swing away from Mr Fujimori, potential
investors are in a mood of more or less permanent wait-and-see, with more
local and foreign money moving through the brisk Lima stock market than into
its productive ventures.
A recent opinion poll, conducted in Peru's main cities by the Imasen private
research institute, has revealed that employment is the main concern of
about 70 per cent of the population, and that worries about terrorism have
diminished in importance - about 30 per cent of the population remains
anxious.
Mr Fujimori's weak political spot is the economy. The reforms have failed to
produce any trickle-down effect so far, and as fear of a resurgence of
hyperinflation and terrorism recedes, Peruvians are starting to grumble
about falling salaries and rising unemployment.

FT  29 SEP 93 / Survey of Peru (7): The Japanese connection / Review of the
effort to attract Pacific Rim investors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SALLY BOWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS hardly surprising that Peru should have developed a special
relationship with Japan.
Mr Fujimori is the first president of Japanese descent anywhere else in the
world, and the Japanese are fascinated by his rise to international
prominence.
Mr Fujimori has visited the land of his ancestors five times since his 1990
election. When the international community reacted with hostility to last
year's institutional coup, Tokyo expressed 'understanding'.
Since then, Japan has played a leading role in the 'support group' of
friendly countries which is helping out on Peru's balance of payments.
Donations have also flowed.
Goodwill, however, has not translated into direct Japanese investment.
Figures from Conite, the Peruvian body which monitors foreign investment,
indicate that less than 3 per cent of the money entering Peru in the first
half of 1993 came from the cautious Japanese.
The Japanese already wield considerable influence in Peru, which has the
largest nikkei colony (about 70,000), bar Brazil, in Latin America. Mr
Fujimori's rise has propelled several traditionally low-profile
Japanese-Peruvians into positions of prominence.
Mr Jaime Yoshiyama, president of congress, and Mr Daniel Hokama, mines
minister and privatisation supremo, are just the tip of the oriental
iceberg.
Most privatisation committees, and many of the remaining state companies and
regional governments have an appointed official with a Japanese surname.
Mr Fujimori does not hide his Asian roots. In an early June trip to Seoul,
he offered the South Koreans an area of the Peruvian coast to serve as an
industrial free zone. The proposal is under evaluation.
The Korean government has reciprocated by offering Dollars 18m to
rehabilitate the airport at Cuzco, expected to spearhead a future tourist
boom. And engineers from Korea's Daewoo Corporation are drawing up plans for
improving the La Paz to Ilo road link, Bolivia's outlet to the sea.
The Chinese, meanwhile, made the single largest investment in Peru for many
years when the Shougang Corporation bought ailing iron producer Hierro Peru
for Dollars 312m last November.
Shougang plans further investments in agro-industry and the fishing sector -
Peruvian fishmeal sales to China topped Dollars 300m last year, around 10
per cent of all export earnings. The Chinese are potential buyers for some
of Pesca Peru's fishmeal processing plants, due for sell-off in coming
months.
China National Mining and China Non-Ferrous are interested in forthcoming
mining sector privatisations. Mr Hernan Barreto, chairman of Centromin,
reported 'enormous interest' in Peruvian copper and iron on his recent visit
to China - apparently in anticipation of a construction boom if Beijing
succeeds in becoming the venue for the Olympics in seven years' time.
Mr Tony Chen, majority shareholder and president of Bandesco, a small but
active Lima-based bank, is helping to 'bridge the Pacific', as he puts it.
Taiwanese-born Mr Chen has excellent links with mainland China and is
already involved with two joint ventures with Shougang.
Bandesco is channelling financing for small and medium-sized Peruvian
businesses via Korea's Eximbank and hopes to do the same with a Taiwanese
government guarantee fund. Mr Chen's bank has also established two trading
and leasing arms of Bandesco to help Korean manufacturing companies, looking
at expansion opportunities in Latin America, set up in Peru.
'Peru has relatively low labour costs and preferential access to certain
markets,' he says. 'Korea has the technical expertise, the customers and
experience in foreign trade which Peru does not. I think it will be a
successful partnership.'
Mr Victor Joy Way, former minister of trade and industry and now Peru's
third vice-president, is of Chinese descent and has longstanding commercial
experience with the Pacific Rim countries. He says Peru's geographical
position makes it attractive for Asian countries.
'What's more,' he says, 'unlike most Latin American countries, Peru is a
racial melting-pot where Asians can easily feel at home.'
The popular Mr Fujimori - affectionately known, as are all orientals in
Peru, as the 'chino' - proves his point.

FT  29 SEP 93 / Survey of Peru (9): Sickened by violence - The problem of
terrorism

ON September 12, the first anniversary of his capture, a video recording of
the imprisoned founder-leader of the Maoist guerrilla group Sendero Luminoso
(Shining Path) was shown to the nation by a smilingly confident Mr Alberto
Fujimori.
'This is a defeated and demoralised man,' the Peruvian president claimed, as
the recording revealed Abimael Guzman pacing the patio of his high-security
cell, pensively smoking a cigarette.
Mr Guzman remains in solitary confinement; representatives of the
International Red Cross and 'occasional intelligence officials' are his only
visitors. He appears to be surviving the rigours of prison life, but he can
have little real notion of what has happened, since last September, to the
organisation which revered him as 'Presidente Gonzalo'.
His surprise arrest in a Lima suburban house last year provoked a domino
effect. Computer records, documents and information extracted during
interrogation led Dincote, Peru's counter-subversive police, to the
hide-outs of many more key leaders.
It is hard to over-estimate the importance, or the timeliness, of the Guzman
capture. It occurred at the height of a Sendero offensive against Lima when,
for the first time ever, civilians in the capital came under attack.
Mr Carlos Bolona, then the economy and finance minister, not a man given to
exaggeration, says: 'another major car-bomb in Lima and the military would
have intervened, arguing that the country was ungovernable.'
President Fujimori claims that 95 per cent of Sendero's 'political bureau'
and 'central committee' is now either dead or behind bars. Mr Raul Gonzales,
an expert on Sendero, recently concluded that the movement 'is no longer
capable of taking power or of destabilising the government or the political
system of Peru.'
Thirteen years of guerrilla warfare and state response - from Sendero's
emergence to burn ballot-boxes in May 1980, up to the present day - have
cost at least 26,000 Peruvian lives. Mr Enrique Bernales, the former senator
who has the most reliable historical statistics on violence in Peru,
estimates the total cost in material damage at between Dollars 22bn and
Dollars 23bn - about the same as Peru's external debt.
Now Mr Bernales' statistics confirm that attacks and killings have declined.
In January 1993, for the first time in 10 years, more Peruvians died from
common violence (in road accidents, domestic disputes and so on) than from
political violence.
Mr Fujimori claims that dismantling Sendero is a result of his 'new'
counter-subversive strategy which 'emphasises intelligence work and the
participation of the people'. He attributes intelligence successes to his
close adviser, the shadowy Mr Vladimiro Montesinos, and the current head of
the joint chiefs of staff, General Nicolas Hermoza.
But, without his institutional coup of last year, on April 5, Mr Fujimori
says that recent advances would have been impossible. His seizure of
quasi-dictatorial powers allowed him to decree sharply increased penalties
for convicted terrorists (terrorism became classified as 'treason'), and to
send suspects for trial by secret military tribunals, before masked judges.
Peru's pre-coup justice system was 'a mockery and a farce,' says Mr
Fujimori. Many terrorists were freed for lack of evidence or released after
serving minimal prison terms. He claims that more people were sentenced for
crimes of terrorism under the new laws in 11 months than in 10 years under
the previous legislation.
Another important element in the Fujimori counter-subversive offensive has
been the arming, nationwide, of ronderos, or civil defence militias. This
has undoubtedly proved a popular measure among defenceless peasants whose
communities were under threat from Sendero guerrillas - although there are
already disturbing indications in some areas (such as the jungle Apurimac
valley) that ronderos are using their new-found power against the state
which armed them, and forming alliances with drugs traffickers.
Psychological tactics have also played an important role. A television
advertising campaign advised guerrilla sympathisers to 'repent, die or spend
your life in jail', as a prison door clanged shut. Almost every night
alleged terrorists, already wearing their famous striped prison suits
(reportedly designed by Mr Fujimori himself) are paraded across the small
screen.
Peruvians, sickened by the long years of violence, generally approve the
Fujimori government's tough line with suspected terrorists. International
community concern focuses on two main issues: the new counter-terrorism laws
and continuing reports of human rights violations.
Amnesty International has objected to the now widespread system of trial
behind closed doors. It warns that, if the death penalty for convicted
terrorists is approved along with the new constitution, 'prisoners could be
executed . . . following conviction in military trials that fall short of
international standards.'
New legislation also facilitates 'unacknowledged detention' - according to
Amnesty 'an underlying cause of the high level of 'disappearance',
extrajudicial execution and torture in the emergency zones.'
Peru has had, for several years, the unenviable distinction of being top of
the world's league table for disappearances. This year the figures are down
 -to 55 in the first eight months of the year, according to Mr Francisco
Soberon of Aprodeh, a Lima-based human rights organisation. Aprodeh counts a
total of 556 'disappeared' in the first three years of the Fujimori
administration.
Despite fewer disappearances, Mr Soberon believes that 'there is a
correlation between that and the rise in the number of detentions.'
According to General Hermoza, more than 4,000 suspected terrorists have been
detained since last year's coup.
Some are undoubtedly innocent. Perhaps a third of all detainees have to be
freed for lack of evidence, says Mr Soberon. 'The military are under heavy
pressure to show they are effective, so are often over-zealous in detaining
people.'
Government authorities, meanwhile, have shown themselves flat-footed in
responding to particularly shocking human rights cases. The current
investigation of human remains in a series of shallow graves near Lima (the
charred bones may be those of some of the nine students and a teacher who
'disappeared' from the La Cantuta university last July) has been painfully
slow. Offers of help from international forensic experts were rejected.
Can Peruvians - and potential foreign investors - be satisfied that
'pacification' is finally on the cards, as new hoardings on the road from
the airport to the centre of town announce?
Most observers agree that Peru's second guerrilla movement, pro-Cuban MRTA,
is as good as finished. 'The remnants are unco-ordinated bands and act
almost like common criminals,' says Mr Bernales. 'There's nothing to
indicate that it is a political organisation any more.'
With founder-leader Mr Victor Polay and his senior lieutenants all serving
life prison sentences, many MRTA militants have taken advantage of the 'laws
of repentance' and have laid down arms.
The same, however, cannot be said for hard-line Sendero Luminoso. Although
Mr Bernales' statistics indicate the movement has lost a third of its
operational capacity, 'the organisation, though weakened, remains,' he says.
In some areas, such as the coca-growing Huallaga valley and the
north-central department of Ancash, it seems to be almost intact.
While the 'quality' of Sendero attacks has fallen, according to Mr Bernales,
he questions President Fujimori's claims about the efficacy of the
intelligence service.
'Attacks are not generally failing because they are detected but because the
perpetrators are inexperienced,' he says. The army has still not adapted its
traditional strategies to allow it to respond to guerrilla harassment.
Mr Bernales warns that society should not let slip its guard - 'Sendero is
too dangerous for that,' he says. 'It's not yet the moment to shout
victory.'

FT  29 SEP 93 / Survey of Peru (8): Still a force to be reckoned with -
Military power is now probably subordinate to civilian power
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THE appearance of tanks in April in the streets of Lima underlined the fact
that the military remain a force to be reckoned with in Peru.
The tanks' deployment, according to military experts, appeared to be a
clumsy - although apparently successful - attempt by General Nicolas Hermoza
Rios, the head of the armed forces, to deter Congressional investigations
into the disappearance and probable murder of nine students and a professor
at the Cantuta teaching institute in Lima in 1992.
The Cantuta affair has become a cause celebre for those who want to end the
continuing immunity of the military from prosecution for human rights
abuses.
But it is more than that: it is a stick with which the opposition can beat
the government. It has also become a lightning rod for apparent divisions
within the armed forces, which some military experts say have deepened under
the government of President Alberto Fujimori.
The students disappeared from Cantuta, a well-known nest of sympathisers for
the Maoist terrorist organisation Sendero - Shining Path - in July last
year, amid an outbreak of bombings in Lima. Documents published this year by
magazines in Lima, and allegations made by General Rodolfo Robles, the
former number three in the military hierarchy, implicated Gen Hermoza and
the president's adviser of intelligence matters, Mr Vladimir Montesinos, in
this and other human rights violations. Gen Robles took refuge in the US
embassy and is now in Argentina.
These developments followed an attempted coup - or at least a coup
conspiracy - by a group of officers, of which Gen Jaime Salinas was the
figurehead leader, against the high command in November last year. The coup
plotters were planning to justify their action by citing their right to
protect the constitution, usurped in April 1992 by President Alberto
Fujimori with the support of many in the high command.
Retired General Gaston Ibanez O'Brien says he saw the actions of generals
Robles and Salinas as reflecting their frustration 'at being passed over for
promotion'. Mr Enrique Obando of the Peruvian Centre of International
Studies says that under the pre-Fujimori regime - where the head of the
armed forces were changed annually - both generals could have expected to be
commander-in-chief.
'During the government of (President Alan) Garcia, the armed forces
appointed their own high command . . . with Fujimori, under a new law, the
president chooses all the high-ranking generals and admirals. The head of
the armed forces can also now remain in office for an entire presidential
term,' says Mr Obando. 'As a result, the choice of the high command has
become politicised.'
This creates a high command, he suggests, that is loyal not to the
constitution but to the president. He describes it as a system of
'co-optation' which has intensified under the current presidency. During the
Garcia period, says Mr Obando, 'the civil government chose the most corrupt
elements in the armed forces for important positions, knowing that the
threat of making public their illegal acts would allow them to be easily
controlled.'
In the Fujimori era, Mr Obando says there has been a struggle - 'very costly
and traumatic' - within the military between the institutionally-minded and
the co-opted senior officers, in which the latter group appears to have been
almost completely victorious.
Resentment among some officers may also have been increased by the power
wielded by Mr Montesinos, who is Mr Fujimori's senior adviser on military
and intelligence matters. (Mr Montesinos, a former lawyer to Mr Fujimori,
was cashiered from the army while a captain, for copying and passing on
information to the US Central Intelligence Agency.)
The choice of high command by the civilian president underlines a
paradoxical aspect of the Fujimori government: although it is often
described as authoritarian, the power of the armed forces at the centre is
probably now more subordinate to the civilian power than at any time since
the military government stepped down in 1980 after 12 years in power.
On the other hand, the power of the armed forces in the regions - given a
freer hand by Mr Fujimori - has increased.
Mr Obando says that like all systems of co-optation this one is dependent on
success for its perpetuation and is therefore inherently unstable.
Nonetheless he believes that the likelihood of further coups against the
Fujimori government is much reduced by the advances in intelligence
gathering. This, says Mr Fujimori, helped to bring about the successes
against Shining Path. Those with knowledge of military issues, however, say
that much intelligence activity has been directed at the armed forces
themselves.
'Vigilance against those who are against Fujimori is high,' says Mr Obando.
Suspicion is such that those visiting Gen Hermoza's office have to give up
their arms before they go in, he adds. 'There are few chances to meet
outside the barracks and nobody now in the armed forces speaks about
political issues - in contrast to the time of Alan Garcia.'

FT  29 SEP 93 / Survey of Peru (6): Sell-offs will pay for improvements -
Sally Bowen watches privatisation speeding up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SALLY BOWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR a year widely billed as 'Peru's year of privatisation' 1993 has been
surprisingly uneventful so far. But the closing three months should see a
clutch of important state company sell-offs.
Barring unexpected hitches, the attractive, partly-developed copper deposits
of Cerro Verde will be sold on October 13.
This will be only the second big public auction of the year - and a full
nine months since January's sale of flag-carrier Aeroperu to a
Mexican-Peruvian consortium for Dollars 54m.
Cerro Verde's potential - with reserves to keep a 40,000 tonne per day
concentrator plant busy for 50 years - has drawn a collection of
international mining companies to register for pre-qualification. Big names
include Cyprus Minerals and Magma Copper from the US; Lac, Cominco and
Placer Dome from Canada, Japan's Mitsui and Marubeni and Outokumpu of
Finland.
Morgan Grenfell, the UK-based investment bank, is promoting Cerro Verde in
addition to Mineroperu's three other production units and a collection of as
yet undeveloped mineral deposits. It is also under contract to handle
December's auction of the telecommunications duo Entel (the 100 per cent
state-owned long distance operator) and CPT (Lima's telephone company, in
which the state has a controlling 20 per cent).
'We see this as a very exciting market,' says Mr David Suratgar, deputy
chairman of Morgan Grenfell International, on an early September visit to
Lima. 'Anyone who saw what happened in Argentina - and in Mexico before that
 -must find Peru very interesting indeed. We thought it better to be
involved at an earlier date.'
When the Fujimori government assumed office in July 1990, 11 of the
country's 12 largest companies were owned and operated by the state. Heavily
overstaffed, protected from international competition and often
incompetently managed by the recipients of political favours, the companies
 -more than 200 of them - were costing a bankrupt nation about Dollars 2.5bn
a year.
'The principal impulse to privatise came from the need for total structural
reform of the state,' says Mr Daniel Hokama, mines and energy minister and
president of Copri, the small, agile, government privatisation commission
set up early last year. 'It has taken an enormous effort to rationalise
public companies, reduce staff and make them viable for sell-off.'
So far, sales have netted a little over Dollars 250m in cash. But future
investment commitments by purchasers will raise that figure enormously. The
Shougang Corporation of the People's Republic of China is to spend Dollars
150m on upgrading iron producer Hierro Peru in the next three years; Mantos
Blancos, the Chilean subsidiary of South African mining giant Anglo American
could invest up to Dollars 500m on developing the copper deposits of
Quellaveco, which it picked up for just Dollars 12m last December.
Government officials also consider foreign investment through privatisation
the only viable way to improve Peru's run-down infrastructure. After years
of macro-economic mismanagement, local companies are severely decapitalised
and have long been unable to meet expanded demand for public services.
Telephones are a striking example. Peru has the worst level of provision in
the Latin American continent: 2.4 lines per hundred inhabitants. December's
sell-off of the two telecommunications companies should, if the buyer
complies with terms of sale, ensure that Dollars 1bn is poured into an
expansion programme over the next five years.
During the five-year period of exclusivity (or, as Copri prefers it,
'transition to full competition') the winning bidder will expected to double
the existing 630,000 lines.
Every town with more than 500 inhabitants will be provided with telephone
services. And the waiting time will be cut from the present - unbelievable -
10 years to one year by 1996, and to one month by the year 2000.
The companies which have already registered their interest are ATT, GTE and
South-Western Bell of the US; the UK's Cable and Wireless; France Telecom;
Telefonica de Espana; STET of Italy and Korea Telecom. They are likely to
form bidding consortia with already established suppliers such as Siemens,
Alcatel, Northern Telecom and Kanematsu.
'We're enthusiastic and we're on schedule,' says Mr Suratgar. 'With every
week that passes, international interest in Peruvian privatisation is
growing.'
Not all has been plain sailing. The institutional coup of April 1992, when
Mr Fujimori closed congress and suspended the constitution, threw the
incipient flow of foreign investment into reverse gear. For a six month
period, several sell-offs flopped.
Successes were confined to a series of relatively small auctions on the
floor of the stock exchange where a handful of local entrepreneurs and some
bold Chilean investors picked up bargains.
Peruvian privatisation has also suffered its share of errors and near
fiascos. Sometimes, exaggerated base prices scared away potential bidders.
On other occasions - notably with the sale of Aeroperu - technical errors in
the back-up documentation required by Copri raised doubts over procedural
transparency.
But the privatisers seem to have learned from their mistakes. 'The
government undoubtedly overestimated its capacity to handle sales,' comments
Mr Augusto Alvarez, an economic analyst and specialist in privatisation.
'But the process is now being managed much more professionally - I foresee
no serious problems.'
If all proceeds on schedule, Cerro Verde, the telecommunications companies
and Centromin, the mining and refining giant, will be transferred to the
private sector before the year's end.
So will a series of smaller but still important state holdings in two cement
companies, the Miski gold mine, the tomato-processing plant of Chao and the
Bolivian branch of the Banco Popular.
While Mr Hokama expects these to be readily saleable, state utilities
(particularly water and parts of the electricity network) will be a tougher
proposition.
'Some of the distribution networks are uneconomic or located in areas where
security problems remain,' says Mr Hokama. 'The Chileans are hugely
interested in the more attractive sectors, but we need to find other bidders
to compete with them.'
One privatisation card yet to be played is debt paper. Mr Fujimori has long
been reluctant to countenance its use, fearing it would mean a field day for
speculators.
But Copri has its plans laid and is 'ready to handle it the moment we're
given the political green light,' said one senior official.
Copri now predicts that all Peru's main state-owned companies, with the
possible exception of Sedapal, the water company, will be transferred to the
private sector by September 1994 - well before the next round of
congressional and presidential elections.
'But whatever happens politically, the privatisation process is already
irreversible,' says Mr Hokama.

FT  29 SEP 93 / Survey of Peru (5): Price has risen steeply in two years -
Creditors have been asked to show imagination over debt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN A LITTLE over two years, the price of Peruvian commercial bank debt on
the secondary market has climbed tenfold from 4 cents for every dollar of
face value to more than 40 cents. The price has risen as the government has
made great efforts to re-insert itself into the international mainstream of
finance.
Many followers of this market find it difficult to understand why the price
has remained at these lofty levels. The reason, in part, is that there are
few 'plays' left in the bank debt market for speculators and an inordinate
amount of interest has been funnelled into a small amount of debt.
According to bankers close to the talks which have restarted between the
government and its leading commercial bank creditors, the International
Monetary Fund is telling the bankers there is not much in the pot for debt
servicing until the end of the millennium.
The IMF figures suggest that paying interest on all public sector debt
should amount to just under 4 per cent of gross domestic product until the
end of 1995. This is more than 40 per cent of what the government is
collecting in taxes and represents already too heavy a burden on an
administration that needs to rebuild social expenditures after the
depredations of the 1980s.
However, according to prime minister Mr Alfonso Bustamante, there is some
leeway: 'There is room to pay something to banks.' However, since 'only half
of the Dollars 6bn is principal, the rest is interest. This makes it very
difficult.' In no large bank rescheduling so far has the ratio of past due
interest to principal been so high - a problem because commercial banks like
to penalise interest arrears in reschedulings so as to discourage them.
A further problem is the more than 50 pending legal suits from banks against
the government, the most difficult of which concerns a Dollars 20m loan from
Chemical Bank made in 1984 to the now defunct Compania Peruana de Vapores.
The government of President Alan Garcia repudiated the debt, claiming that
the transaction was fraudulent.
President Albert Fujimori has asked for imagination from creditors in
approaching the debt issue. Mr Jorge Gonzales Izquierdo, head of the
economic faculty at the University of the Pacific, says that imagination has
been in short supply.
Mr Gonzales Izquierdo calls for a three-track approach to the problem: ask
for a deep debt forgiveness, including from the Paris Club of creditor
nations to which Peru owes Dollars 8bn of its total Dollars 23bn foreign
debt; get waivers from banks to buy back the commercial debt in the
secondary market; and aggressively use the debt, heavily discounted, as
currency in privatisation programmes.
The approach has not been followed in part because of the deep dislike of
Japan to debt forgiveness on its own debts. Upsetting the Japanese
government by demanding debt write-downs would potentially jeopardise new
aid flows from Tokyo, which have become especially important with the hold
up of aid flows from the US because of human rights concerns.
Furthermore, the price of the debt at the moment would act as a deterrent to
a successful buyback programme. The government says it is working on the
debt-equity conversion idea, but the soundings coming from government
officials suggest it will be less than aggressive.
Mr Bustamante says: 'We are evaluating the debt-for-equity issue. We think
that where a company is very profitable we prefer to sell for cash. Where a
company is losing money, we can sell it for debt.'
Yet the rules are still to be worked out. If the privatisation programme
goes ahead as the government is envisaging, it had better get a move on.

FT  29 SEP 93 / Survey of Peru (3): Overheads are still too high - The
banking sector has been slow to adjust to change
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
OF all Peru's sectors, banking has been one of the slowest in adjusting to
the new economic climate.
In spite of the rapid contraction of the economy, which has seen the amount
of money handled by the financial system shrink to one-third of mid-1980s
levels, many of the 20 commercial banks have been flat-footed in their
attempts to cut overheads.
'Operating expenses are still high,' says Mr Luis Cortavarria, the banking
superintendent. 'They are falling, but not by as much as we would expect.
Some banks are planning to cut jobs and to reduce their size. But this is
happening slowly and it has not gone far enough yet.'
Failure to rationalise partly explains Peru's gaping interest rate spreads,
as financial institutions try to compensate for hefty overheads. Banks also
have to contend with high taxes and the dead-weight of non-performing loans,
which make up more than 20 per cent of total portfolios.
The result is borrowing rates of at least twice international levels; a
crippling burden for companies already battered by recession.
Authorities believe Peru is still over-banked. It has sought to encourage
consolidation by waiving a series of fees for merging banks, a dispensation
likely to be extended by a further year to the end of 1994. The government
has also attempted to refinance the commercial sector's non-performing loans
 -which total at least Dollars 300m - by introducing a debt restructuring
scheme. Funds of Dollars 100m in cash and Dollars 100m in bonds have been
made available, but only about Dollars 30m has been disbursed.
Mr Cortavarria says that further restructuring will probably rely on bond
emissions, not cash release, because of fiscal restraints. 'Restructuring
hasn't been handled as fast as we expected,' he says. 'We are expecting
positive results down the road, but it is too early to say how successful
the programme has been.'
He hopes the process will quicken with the introduction of a scheme intended
to allow banks to exchange problem loans for equity in debtor companies. The
initiative should come into effect 'within the next few months'. Alongside
the general 'demonetisation' of the financial system, a situation described
as 'catastrophic' by one banker, there has been a marked shift towards
'dollarisation.' The result of lack of faith in the Peruvian sol, together
with fears that inflation has not yet been killed off, has been that more
than 80 per cent of bank deposits have been made in dollars.
Mr Cortavarria is philosophical. 'This is something that we have to live
with for a few years. It is going to take time for people to gain confidence
in the sol - and this is perfectly understandable, given the hyperinflation
of 1989. It is tough for Peruvians to have faith in their national
currency.'
Similar to the public's mistrust of the sol has been its drift towards a
parallel banking system. The most spectacular unlicensed institution was the
Clae Bank, under investigation by the superintendent since April, which was
offering real interest rates of 150 per cent a year. The authorities, which
admit they still do not know how the Clae sustained such rates, say they
cannot allow banks to operate outside official regulations. The clampdown
reflects other regulatory action taken over the past few years, aimed at
'cleaning up the financial sector'.
In March 1991, rules were introduced requiring banks to employ international
standards in assessing their loan portfolios, and authorities closed down
debt-ridden home loan institutions and savings co-operatives. Four state
development banks, which had run up huge bad loan portfolios, were scrapped.
Authorities also put the Banco de la Nacion, which formerly monopolised
state sector accounts, on an equal footing with commercial banks. In
practice, little business has transferred to the private sector, which is
extremely wary of taking on state customers.
There has been international pressure for Banco de la Nacion, which
maintains more than Dollars 400m of non-performing loans, to be closed. This
is unlikely to happen; officials argue privately that the bank, which
maintains Peru's largest network of branches, plays a social role which
could not be filled by the commercial sector. The superintendent has also
tightened up reserve requirements and lending criteria, further reducing
liquidity.
Authorities deny that such measures have pushed interest rates higher,
arguing that most banks would rather lodge their money with the central bank
than risk adding to their bad loan portfolios. Renewed attempts to shake up
the financial system are expected this December, when Interbanc, the
country's fourth largest, is put up for sale. The government's attempt to
privatise Banco Popular last year ended in failure when the bank was
liquidated after no buyers could be found.
Authorities are hoping to have more success with Interbanc and with Banco
Continental, the second-largest commercial institution, slated for sale in
the first half of 1994. The timetable, however, looks in danger of slipping.
It is unclear if there will be foreign interest in entering Peru's personal
banking sector, given the existing structural problems. Banks such as
Citibank, which has been in Peru for 73 years, have shown a preference for
investment and corporate transactions.
Some analysts expect interest from other Latin American banks wishing to
expand in the region. Others have speculated that institutions such as
Citibank and Banco de Lima, majority-owned by Credit Lyonnais, may seek to
use their debt paper to buy up one or both banks.
Mr Cortavarria admits that 'there has not been too much interest at this
time,' but feels sure that 'it will come'. He believes foreign banks will be
attracted by Peru's 'very strong economic potential' and by the prospects of
investment banking as the country re-establishes international links.
The hope is that foreign banks will set up branches in Lima as
multinationals return and as Peru's privatisation drive gathers momentum.
The entrance of foreign banks, plus new financing opportunities provided by
recently established private pension funds, could help to reduce interest
rates as well as injecting greater competition.
According to one analyst: 'As people look for alternative means of
financing, Peruvian banks will have to wake up.'

FT  29 SEP 93 / Survey of Peru (4): Stability spurs trading surge - Bourse
generates interest among small investors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SALLY BOWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SUDDENLY everyone in Lima is talking about the stock market. Middle-class
housewives and small entrepreneurs who have never owned a share in their
lives are swapping tips by telephone, or puzzling over late-afternoon coffee
and cakes as to why a particular stock rocketed or plunged today.
Much of the euphoria - or collective hysteria, as one analyst prefers to put
it - springs from the small but active bourse's performance last year, when
the index turned in a spectacular 125 per cent profit in dollar terms. That
thrust Lima into the international limelight as the world's second most
profitable bourse of 1992.
In the first eight months of this year, the general shares index put on an
impressive 76 per cent in dollar terms. The rise continued throughout the
first half of September before profit-taking caused slight second-half
falls.
Trading volume has increased significantly during the past couple of months.
On August 19, an all-time record Dollars 16.9m changed hands in one day on
the stock exchange floor. The record was beaten again less than three weeks
later when trading topped Dollars 21m in a day.
Total volume traded this year has already exceeded USDollars 1.02bn - well
over double the first nine months of last year.
By the middle of September, daily volume was averaging Dollars 7.5m with
more than 1,000 transactions handled daily.
Market capitalisation has also spurted - from Dollars 1.4bn at the end of
1991, to Dollars 2.6bn twelve months later and around Dollars 4.5bn today.
This makes Peru a pygmy by comparison with Mexico, Chile, Brazil and
Argentina but puts it in the same league as Venezuela and Colombia. Volumes
traded daily in Lima are now considerably larger than in the last two
bourses, and on occasion exceed amounts handled in Santiago.
Stepped-up activity has spawned a series of Lima-based brokerages, often
offshoots of local banks. Stock exchange managers, meanwhile, have forged
ahead with modernising antiquated systems - computer terminals now allow
brokers to follow trading movements in real time from their offices. And a
series of agreements has been signed with other Latin American and European
exchanges to allow closer integration.
Brokers attribute the recent boost in trading to improved perspectives for
political stability. Trading took off immediately congress approved the new
constitution in mid-August - with its deregulated, liberal economic
framework and the possibility of a second consecutive term for President
Fujimori.
Also inspiring foreign investor confidence were opening talks with banking
creditors in New York aimed at finding a solution to Peru's USDollars 6bn
commercial debt.
Increased trading has involved both the known foreign investors who have
been represented in Lima for around two years, and a rash of new, first-time
punters. Among these is Mr George Soros whose Quantum Fund managers have
already invested in the Peruvian stock market and remain bullish about
future growth.
Brokers say that, as well as the inevitable speculators attracted by last
year's spectacular performance, the Lima bourse is now drawing a significant
number of foreign institutional investors who are looking at the medium to
long term. Foreign investment accounts for more than two-thirds of all
volume traded.
The specialist Peru fund launched earlier this year by Latin American
Securities, now Foreign and Colonial Emerging Markets, has done well. Some
Dollars 19m was invested and assets, helped by some well-chosen second-line
stocks and smaller company shares, have put on around 40 per cent since
April.
Institutional investors however, seeking elasticity and volume, tend to go
for Peru's few, highly liquid blue chips. These include the two main
breweries, Backus and Johnston, and CNC; the Banco de Credito, Peru's
largest private bank; Southern Peru Copper Corporation, Buenaventura and
Milpo in the mining sector; and the soon-to-be-privatised telephone company
CPT plus two state-controlled cement companies, also due for sell-off late
this year.
The principal problem facing the bolsa at present is the lack of
instruments. 'There's too much money chasing too few shares,' says Mr Jose
Luque Otero, the Lima stock exchange president. 'With only 300 stocks
quoted, demand is exceeding supply.' This has led certain shares, for long
undervalued, rising too sharply. Mr Jeremy Campbell-Lamerton of Inverlat
International's London office calculates that some Peruvian stocks are now
overpriced by perhaps ten per cent.
'This particularly applies to mining sector shares, which have rocketed on
rumour alone,' he says.
For Mr Luque Otero, the solution lies in convincing more Peruvian companies
to launch new share issues. Peru's traditional economic power groups and
family businesses, he says, have long been accustomed to raising capital
through bank borrowing. He says a recent, highly successful, share issue by
the brewery CNC could be a pointer for the future.
While he expects larger companies to start issuing bonds in the near future
 -recent legislation means there is no longer any tax on capital gains from
bonds or from shares - share issues should be an attractive option for
smaller businesses.
'We and Conasev, the securities commission, still need to work hard on
raising consciousness about the stock market at all levels,' Mr Luque says.

FT  29 SEP 93 / Survey of Peru (2): 'Pragmatism doesn't mean short-term
solutions' / Interview with President Fujimori - the questions were put to
him by Stephen Fidler, the FT's Latin America editor
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
QUESTION: Many people have told me that the economy is in better shape and
the security situation has improved significantly over the last year or two.
If you have achieved these gains under the existing constitution, why are
you seeking a new one?
Answer: It's a good question. The political system clearly didn't function
in the battle against terrorism and in the search for development. The
democracy established in Peru resulted in violence, corruption, inefficiency
of the state. Also poverty, authoritarianism, weak growth, low incomes,
hyperinflation and general indebtedness.
One of the biggest problems was violence, which advanced - not because
Sendero Luminoso had any merits - but because the state was so inefficient.
This produced the rupture of April 5 last year. That was a break with the
previous system and now we want to normalise the situation from what is
evidently a period of transition.
The changes proposed include some important reforms concerning the
legislature and the judiciary. We are seeking a more efficient Congress and
a judiciary less dependent on political party interests, less subject to
manipulation and corruption. These are fundamental reforms, without which we
would continue to suffer political instability.
Q: Are the economic reforms you have introduced to date irreversible or
could they be in danger at some point in the future?
A: I think that the reforms are irreversible, and the new constitution will
make sure of that in respect of the economy and the restructuring of the
state. For example, the process of privatisation would be legitimised by the
referendum.
Q: If the changes are irreversible, why would you need another term as
president?
A: The irreversibility will derive from my remaining in office until 1995
and from the new constitution. The possibility of another period has been
incorporated so that the people can decide as in other aspects of the
referendum, including the death penalty.
Q: Would you like another term as president?
A: I've no ambition at all to follow this with another period in office. I
don't have this obsession. What interests me is to put in place the steps
for development and to consolidate all the reforms that have been made. This
consolidation will be obtained in the period until 1995.
Q: Even some of your supporters say there is a danger in your pragmatism and
the fact that you don't seem to have a strong ideology. For instance, they
fear that you might change policies should you suffer a fall in popularity.
Is this fair?
A: No, because popularity derives from the coherence of the government's
policies. And pragmatism doesn't necessarily or in any way mean short-term
solutions.
During these three years we have applied solutions based in the medium and
long term. It is a pragmatism that has its sights on the medium term,
independent of popularity. People don't want short-term solutions.
Q: You often draw a contrast between yourself and traditional politicians.
But don't you also have a tendency towards 'personalismo', which is far from
being new in Latin American politics.
A: Yes, I think most people want a strong executive power which exercises
its mandate to the full, that uses all its faculties to achieve important
objectives. Here there is a president of the board or a general manager who
controls, supervises, prosecutes and tries to ensure things go well.
Q: You often talk about the transparency of your government, but in some
respects your own government lacks transparency. For example, your brother
is in an important office, as is Mr Montesinos, someone about whom people
know little. (Mr Santiago Fujimori is a presidential adviser who, among
other things, co-ordinates the use of international aid donations. Mr
Vladimir Montesinos is a senior intelligence official and adviser to the
president.)
A: I would say that if we are only talking about two people, it's very few.
A brother close to the president who works in various areas doesn't
necessarily have to be in the limelight. And I would like to be precise
about Mr Montesinos.
You have said that people don't know him, but the people don't worry about
Mr Montesinos. He preoccupies a certain section of the press which wants to
assassinate his character. As a result, he's been satanised. Intelligence
people work everywhere without being identified. I don't think intelligence
people in London have to identify themselves.
Q: But a survey in the magazine Debate of the most important people in Peru
suggested that Mr Montesinos was the second most powerful person in the
country. I don't think this is so in other countries.
A: The survey in Debate was of 1,000 people of a certain level -
intellectuals, journalists - but didn't include people in general. These
people follow the comments made particularly by magazines. The best-known
magazine in Lima takes a position openly - position for position - against
the government. As a result, it has satanised (Mr Montesinos) . . . I don't
agree with the conclusions of the survey.
Q: Then who is the second most powerful person in the country?
A: I think it has to be Jaime Yoshiyama, president of Congress. Of this I've
no doubt.
REASONS BEHIND DELAYS IN THE PRIVATISATION PROGRAMME
Q: To change the theme, why has been a delay in the privatisation programme?
A: There are various reasons. The first is that some of these public
companies required some adjustments to be made by the state in order that we
sell a more profitable company.
Point two: privatisations require large resources because each one of the
medium-sized and large state companies had very heavy liabilities in the way
of debt and excess personnel.
Third: the legislation didn't permit adequate privatisation. We therefore
had to introduce modifications to the laws which related to the functioning
of these companies within the framework of a market economy.
Fourth: nobody was going to invest in Peru while there was terrorism -
nobody, particularly foreign companies. The large companies which are the
most profitable - telecommunications and electricity - would have sold but
at very low prices. The shares of the telephone company a year and a half
ago cost 40 centavos; today, the price is seven soles.
I think like the manager of the state, and I want good business for the
government, for Peru. Now we are selling companies in a secure country and
without liabilities, in good shape, and therefore there is a lot of
interest.
A year and half ago no mining company, Peruvian or foreign, would have
considered investing in Peru because it was impossible to work in the mines
 -terrorists attacked them and took the dynamite and killed the engineers.
Now there is a large quantity of investment in the mining sector, including
Centromin, for which nobody would have given anything. Now Centromin's in
good shape and many companies are interested in its privatisation.
Therefore, in the large companies, it is a question of 'timing'. The
economic programme would not have made sense had terrorism continued.
Q: The privatisation programme will be completed when?
A: In 1994 we will have sold all the companies - or nearly all. In some
sectors we are still discussing - for example in electricity - if we are
going to sell the generation capacity and the distribution system. This is
not yet settled.
Q: Will you allow foreign debt to be used as payment for privatisations?
A: Now we are going to open the possibility of using it, but we'll do it on
a case-by-case basis. This we have told the banks.
Q: Peru's membership of the Andean Pact was suspended this year (from April
1992 until the end of 1993, when a review was planned). Is it going to
rejoin?
A: Yes, at some point we are going to rejoin, but not necessarily at the end
of this year. There are still problems, but we have had bilateral
negotiations which have allowed there to be a fairly open market among these
countries. We had problems with products that were, in effect, subsidised.
Q: For example?
A: In the steel sector and in general, all that had to do with the intensive
use of energy.
Q: But isn't Venezuela - for example - going to have cheap energy in the
long term? It seems that the problem won't be resolved quickly.
A: It can also be resolved by the greater efficiency of Peru's national
industry which would permit greater equilibrium.
Q: On the debt question, is there really any room to pay more interest to
the banks? You're currently negotiating with banks; in reality will it be
possible to give them anything?
A: It's true that there's not much room in our economic programme in a
strict sense. We hope for some form of treatment that allows us to face this
problem in that we are entering a period of reduced government income.
Q: Why?
A: The tax system is not 100 per cent efficient; tax collection is
relatively low.
Q: So you need to reform the tax system?
A: What we need is more efficiency and better management of the system.
Nonetheless, it has made enormous advances.
Q: Aren't the bank negotiations going to be difficult, in the sense that you
haven't much money to pay them?
A: They are going to be difficult and we are going to ask for good
understanding and much imagination in order to find some kind of solution
for the refinancing. We think that there is confidence since the debt has
increased in price from 5 per cent (of face value) to over 40 per cent. This
is a sign of confidence abroad.
Q: What will happen in the struggle against drugs traffickers, particularly
since the policy of the US may be changing?
A: I don't think there is enough force in the international community over
this issue. The drugs trafficking problem is a world problem. In Peru we are
trying to avoid the expansion of drugs production, controlling it the
maximum possible to avoid an increase in production.
This is not only a problem here in Peru, nor in the Andes. If the resources
we receive fall, this is not only a reduction in resources for Peru but a
reduction of resources for the fight against drugs.
Q: Is it true that Foncodes (the state social emergency and development
fund) has run out of funds until the end of the year?
A: The tax collection problem also affects Foncodes. This will reduce
certain social works, which isn't good either for pacification or for social
development. We face this type of problem. What we have done so far (in
social works) has mainly been achieved with national resources and there has
been little international help. For some years, Peru has been a country that
hasn't received much aid. After April 5, some countries that had restarted
aid suspended it once more. Now, happily, these countries are renewing
co-operation - a concrete case is Germany. Still, this co-operation remains
limited and will remain so given the relations between the developing world
and Latin America.
Q: What effect did the adverse reaction of other countries to the events of
April 5 have on your plans?
A: Government policy was fundamentally concerned with the fight against
terrorism. If I'd thought that the international reaction would be as strong
as it actually was I would have taken exactly the same measures. No country
in the world would accept that in their country 25,000 people would die in
the fight against terrorism.
Q: But did the force of the negative reaction surprise you?
A: Yes, it was larger than I had foreseen. The reaction was significantly
different inside and outside the country, but outside they had not suffered
25,000 dead.
Q: Did this then advance your plans for reinstalling Congress, for example?
A: Certain adjustments had to be made but towards an end that was totally
unchanged: the authentic democratisation of the country and a country more
secure.
Q: Was there some luck in the capture of Abimael Guzman in September 1992?
A: I think that at the start we worked to seek efficiency in the police, and
put emphasis on the development of intelligence. The policy yielded results.

FT  29 SEP 93 / Survey of Peru (1): A fragile confidence begins to return -
President Alberto Fujimori's government has embarked on a programme to
stabilise and deregulate the economy - and to battle against terrorism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
A FRAGILE confidence is returning to Peru after a decade of violence and
economic collapse.
The two men most associated with this dismal decade are - for now at least -
safely out of the way. Abimael Guzman, the provincial academic who led the
Maoist guerrilla group Sendero Luminoso in a battle against the state, is
behind bars, his campaign having caused the deaths of 26,000 people and
Dollars 22bn of damage.
The former head of state Alan Garcia, president from 1985 to 1990, is in
exile. His government turned the country into the pariah of international
finance by not servicing its foreign debt. Worse: it squandered the
resources that it gained by not paying. After a short state-financed boom,
the economy collapsed and hyper-inflation, peaking at 397 per cent a month,
ensued.
The two men were as much manifestations as architects of Peru's ills. The
society was as deeply divided on racial lines as any in South America:
Sendero's essentially middle-class leadership fed on the resentment among
the poor indigenous groups that this fostered. The Garcia government
meanwhile represented the corrupt culmination of years of statism which
intensified Peru's already profound poverty.
Given this, it would be unrealistic to expect an economic quick fix.
Nonetheless, matters have improved sufficiently for investors, internal and
external, to begin a gradual return to the country. Since the arrest in
September, 1992, of Guzman and the detention of other guerrilla leaders, the
political risk of investment is viewed as considerably diminished.
Furthermore, investor confidence has been spurred by the privatisation plans
of the government of President Alberto Fujimori - now apparently moving
ahead after numerous delays - and its investment and other reforms. The
government is back in the good graces of the international financial
institutions in Washington, having cleared its arrears to them and begun
negotiations with foreign commercial banks. Its foreign reserves, which were
negative at times in 1988, have risen to levels high enough to cover seven
months of imports, and inflation is down to double-digit annual levels.
In the last few months, the economic picture has improved further. The
economy has started to pick up this year, enough at least to erase the
effects of a weak 1992 when the austere fiscal targets of an International
Monetary Fund programme, terrorism and drought-induced electricity shortages
resulted in the economy shrinking by 3 per cent.
After falling sharply early in the Fujimori government, inflation became
sticky. Now it may be falling again. Mr Jorge Gonzales Izquierdo, the
Chicago-educated dean of the economics faculty of the University of the
Pacific, says the improvement follows a shift in central bank policy. This
year the bank stopped targeting the exchange rate - a policy which led last
year to a appreciation of the real value of the Peruvian currency, the sol,
to the displeasure of exporters - and now seeks to curb excessive money
supply growth.
Yet these advances have yet to show through as tangible benefits to a
population, nearly 60 per cent of whom were in absolute poverty in 1989,
according to the World Bank. Mr Fujimori remains popular because he is seen
as having brought security and a more stable economy, not because he has
advanced the material conditions of Peruvians.
Mr Fujimori, who took office in 1990 for a five-year term, is not a natural
economic reformer. It took time for him to be persuaded that privatisation
was beneficial. He emphasises his government's pragmatism, which liberal
critics read as a suggestion that his market-oriented policies depend on his
continued popularity.
Although Mr Carlos Bolona, economy minister for 23 months until he was
sacked in January, has regularly fallen out with the president, he gives him
the benefit of the doubt: 'It's true that Fujimori is not a convinced
liberal, but in his pragmatism, he has backed a programme that has seen
results.'
But even Mr Bolona says that the reform is not moving ahead as he would
like. 'Until now we are still on track. For two years we were moving ahead
with full speed. Now we are moving ahead by inertia.'
PART of the problem is the lack of a large team to push economic reform
forward. Only a handful of people is helping Mr Jorge Camet, the 65-year-old
minister of economy, a much smaller group than those who pursued reform in
Mexico, Argentina, or even Bolivia.
The small size of the group has also hindered implementation of legislation
already passed - the government's labour law reform is an example - because
there is nobody to draft the rules.
Furthermore, even according to its supporters, the government persists in
policies which continue economic distortions. The expensive support of
irrigation projects in the north and the continuing import taxes on
foodstuffs such as rice, wheat, sugar and milk, which overwhelmingly benefit
agricultural co-operatives in the north and do little to help the poorest
farmers in the mountains, are two examples.
On top of that, according to market-oriented economists, new distortions are
being introduced. The government is proposing that a 9 per cent tax paid by
employees to Fonavi, the state housing fund, should be changed, leaving 3
per cent to be paid by workers and 6 per cent by the companies that employ
them. What is in effect a new payroll tax could well deter future employment
and wage increases.
Mr Gonzales Izquierdo is also critical of the government for not placing
enough emphasis early in its term on social spending, for example on
education. Now that is changing, Mr Fujimori is emphasising physical
spending - for example on new school buildings and computers rather than on
quality of the education.
Tackling social problems is hindered by a lack of state resources, brought
about by problems with tax collection. Mr Fujimori has acknowledged this as
an issue constraining the government. Mr Gonzales Izquierdo says that the
state's poor performance in tax collection - along with a foreign debt
standing at a worrying five times annual exports - represents an Achilles
heel in economic policy.
'In the last three months, in real terms, tax collection has fallen. This is
very serious,' says Mr Gonzales Izquierdo. He calculates that tax collection
 -which he estimates will turn out at about 8.8 per cent of GDP this year -
will fall short of the 9.1 per cent called for in the IMF programme signed
earlier this year.
(This assumes that the actual size of the Peruvian economy is in line with
official figures suggesting a GDP of more than Dollars 40bn, which is almost
certainly an exaggeration. Given the size of the informal sector and the
high dollarisation of the economy, estimating GDP is pretty much guesswork.
Estimates vary between Dollars 20bn and Dollars 40bn. The University of the
Pacific, estimating that the informal economy accounts for 40 per cent of
all economic activity, has come up with a Dollars 30bn figure.)
The government inherited a tax system devastated by hyper-inflation. By the
end of the Garcia era, Peruvians were paying only 4.4 per cent of GDP, using
official figures, compared with an historical norm ranging from 15 per cent
to 20 per cent in exceptional years.
The IMF is seeking a tax collection target of 13 per cent (based on official
GDP statistics) by 1995. Whether this can be achieved depends on how much
GDP is being overestimated. If GDP is really only Dollars 20bn, tax
collection must actually rise to a figure of about 25 per cent to meet
targets which, given the extent of activity in the informal economy, mean a
heavy burden on the minority who pay tax.
Thus a potentially vicious circle is developing, with high taxes driving
more and more taxpayers either partially or wholly into the informal economy
and narrowing the tax base still further.
Still, it is credible to argue that the way forward for Peru has been
trail-blazed by Chile, which pursued growth by exploiting its comparative
advantage in the production of raw materials. In some areas, Peru's
comparative advantage is greater than Chile's, and the prices of assets in
Peru are significantly cheaper.
The question investors are asking, therefore, is whether the government can
retain the upper hand against terrorism, and what are the risks of a sharp
reverse in economic policy which would, for example, halt foreign exchange
remittances.
GIVEN the successes against the leadership of Sendero Luminoso, few people
in Lima appear to expect a resurgence of the bombings that so sapped
confidence in the capital last year. However, a few big bombs could
underline the fragility of this view.
Furthermore, even if Sendero is defeated in the countryside - and it is
still powerful in many areas - Mr Fujimori's policy of arming civilians to
fight terrorism means there are many more weapons in circulation in Peru. As
has already happened in some zones, banditry - often linked to the cocaine
trade - may replace terrorism as the number one security problem.
On the economic front, Mr Fujimori says a new constitution - to replace the
statist-inclined charter of 1979 - and his two further years in office will
be the true guarantor that economic change is permanent. The new
constitution, which will be put to a referendum on October 31, contains
important changes, some elements of which are seen as necessary - for
example a reform of a corrupt judicial system.
Yet, because the changes are so wide-ranging - they include a proposal to
reintroduce the death penalty - they may encourage a rainbow of opposition,
beyond the traditional political parties Mr Fujimori purports to despise.
Most opinion polls suggest the new constitution will secure a majority, but
unless that majority is large, the temptation will be great for a successor
government to change it again.
Constitutions in Latin America in any case often mean little. What worries
some people in Lima even more is the personal nature of Mr Fujimori's style
of government. Mr Fujimori is not viewed as an institution builder, and he
has centralised power since he took office. He has done little to establish
the rule of law - indeed he undermined it, by suspending the constitution on
April 5 last year. Human rights abuses by the security forces continue to
bring domestic and international condemnation.
'He has been good at destroying the bad; but he has been less effective at
creating something to take its place,' says Mr Augusto Alvarez, economic
analyst and editor.
While he is still popular with many poor Peruvians, who see him as an
outsider, like themselves, Mr Fujimori seems to trust few people. He appears
to owe few favours to the traditionally powerful in Peru. Yet, while this
has had the benefit of giving him a free hand in policy-making and has freed
most of his administration from the taint of corruption accusations, it may
also have encouraged policy mistakes. For example, he underestimated the
adverse international reaction to his April 5 usurping of the constitution,
a reaction that nearly killed off his economic programme.
This has also increased speculation about the few people he does appear to
trust, in particular his adviser on security and intelligence matters, Mr
Vladimiro Montesinos. In a survey carried out by a Lima magazine, the
little-known Mr Montesinos - who won a libel action against a publication
describing him as a Rasputin - was adjudged the second most powerful man in
the country.
Mr Fujimori paints himself as a new-style leader in contrast with the
corrupt traditional party politicians that went before him.
In some senses, this is true: he has no real party, which in part explains,
says Mr Enrique Obando of the Peruvian Institute for International Studies,
his reliance on the army. Yet in Mr Fujimori's authoritarian streak, many
see the stamp of the traditional Latin American leader.
Most people believe that Mr Fujimori wants a second term of office, though
he denies it, and one of the proposed changes to the constitution would
allow him to run again.
The president, therefore, has a fine line to walk. To win the election, he
may be tempted to depict himself as the only person who can save the
country. But to get the economy going again and to reassure investors, he
cannot afford to scare people too much about what will happen if somebody
else wins.

FT  29 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: Hanson retreats
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO and CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hanson gave up 4 1/2 to 253 1/2 p as turnover rose to 16m, after BZW and SG
Warburg reduced profits expectations. In a detailed note on the company, BZW
lowered its current year forecast by Pounds 50m to Pounds 1.08bn and trimmed
the following year's figure by Pounds 35m to Pounds 1.195bn, to take account
of the costs of a strike at Peabody, its US coal operation.
The strike started in February. Warburg is believed to have weighed in with
a more severe downgrade in profits, trimming its forecast by Pounds 65m to
Pounds 1.2bn, for the same reasons.
Warburg was reported to have advised investors to switch out of Hanson and
into BTR, a stock that has been underperforming the market in recent
sessions. The shares climbed 10 1/2 to 371 1/2 p in heavy trade of 9.3m.
Talk that Bass may surprise the market with a gloomy statement at a meeting
with analysts tomorrow was being heard and the shares drifted back before
rallying late in the trading session. They closed steady at 465p.
Scottish &amp; Newcastle was hit by renewed rumours that it was negotiating to
buy a big part of Grand Metropolitan's Chef and Brewer chain of restaurants
and that a large rights issue would be its probable choice of payment. The
shares dipped 5 to 470p. However, analysts are still tipping Whitbread, up 5
at 541p, as the favourite to land the 1,500-strong pub and restaurant chain.
The emergence of S&amp;N has shifted the secondary spotlight away from
Allied-Lyons as a potential Chef and Brewer purchaser and the relief helped
the shares gain 10 at 570p.
GrandMet basked in positive comments over its restructuring and management
changes and the shares rose 15 to 418p.
Minorco relinquished 6 to 1229p after announcing an asset swap with its
majority shareholders, South African groups Anglo American and De Beers
Centenary.
The 10 per cent improvement in the dividend at insurance group London &amp;
Manchester cheered the market and the shares jumped 16 to 365p.
Kleinwort Benson, the UK merchant bank, was reported to have advised
investors to switch into Legal &amp; General and out of Prudential Corporation.
The former rose 10 to 489p on the advice, while the latter closed 2 ahead at
348p. The recent selling in Sun Alliance appeared to have dried up, leaving
the shares to advance 8 to 385p.
Among banks, talk that Royal Bank of Scotland was to float off its Direct
Line Insurance business returned to the market, helping the shares to firm 3
to 316p. However, leading market watchers dismissed the speculation.
The renewed speculation that TSB was at last about to dispose of Hill
Samuel, its merchant banking subsidiary, along with further positive
recommendations from analysts, saw the shares add 4 1/2 at 221 1/2 p.
Hotel group Forte drifted back ahead of results due tomorrow, with NatWest
Securities reiterating its sell stance. The shares eased 3 to 237p.
Brent Walker felt the fallout from the hefty losses and gloomy outlook
announced on Monday, the shares weakening 1 1/2 to 5 1/2 p. First Leisure
put on 8 at 276p at the start of a series of presentations by NatWest
Securities to institutions in Scotland.
Also holding meetings in recent sessions has been Granada, with analysts and
institutions being told of steady trading and rosier prospects. Smith New
Court, in its latest research note, says: 'Given the ability of Granada to
continue to grow earnings even in unhelpful economic circumstances, its
rating looks very undemanding.' The shares moved ahead 8 to 448p.
A squeeze in Rank Organisation shares sent them scurrying forward 16 to
817p. Thorn EMI, rebuffing press criticism of its Rent-A-Centre business in
the US, gained 10 at 941p.
Trimming of profits forecasts continued in Hazlewood Foods and the shares
lost 3 to 172p.
A presentation at BZW by Carlton Communications was said to be a factor in
its advance of 19 to 743p.
A buy note from James Capel was said to have helped Dixons appreciate 7 to
263p. The agm at Great Universal Stores disappointed stores analysts, who
had been hoping for some detail on current trading. The shares, which have
galloped in recent sessions, steadied yesterday at 2241p.
Profit-taking continued in Next, which slipped 2 to 198p. More talk was
heard of good business being done at Marks and Spencer and the stock climbed
7 1/2 to 386 1/2 p. Storehouse shed 2 to 221p, with UBS said to be negative.
Talk of disposals at international trading group Inchcape saw the shares add
9 at 531p.
Shares in Cookson Group, under pressure at the tail end of last week
following a profits downgrading from Smith New Court, rallied 3 1/2 to 194
1/2 p, with Hoare Govett and James Capel said to have been recommending the
stock.
Andrew Sykes, which tumbled on Monday following a profits warning, bounced
up 5 to 80p as bargain hunters moved in.
Engineering group Siebe moved forward 10 to 535p after the company confirmed
that it was consolidating its business activities into three divisions and
making changes in senior management. The company had signalled the changes
in recent meetings with analysts.
A profits upgrade from Hoare Govett boosted FKI, 5 stronger at 151 1/2 p.
The broker only raised the current year forecast by Pounds 1m to Pounds 51m,
but improved the following year's figure by Pounds 6m to Pounds 66m. TI
Group edged 8 ahead to 343p, with Kleinwort Benson said to be positive on
the stock.
Drug shares remained under a cloud as Wall Street influences again governed
events. Wellcome fell 11 1/2 to 694 1/2 p and Glaxo 13 1/2 to 633p.
Waste management group Shanks &amp; McEwan retreated as a number of brokers were
said to have cut their profits forecasts. The shares retreated 6 to 169p.
Among transport stocks, P&amp;O gave up 8 to 567p, with Smith New Court said to
have reiterated its cautious stance. The broker remains concerned about the
implications of increased competition on routes across the Channel. Smith
also suggested that on a 12-month view the yield had been eroded to no more
than the market average.

FT  29 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: Lasmo declines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO and CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in oil group Lasmo came under pressure after a broker turned negative
on the stock. The shares slipped 4 to 143p in volume of 6.4m after Strauss
Turnbull returned the stock to its sell list after a six-month reprieve
during which it had advised investors to hold the stock.
Mr Howard Cattermole at Strauss said the company 'will come under financial
strain because it is barely profitable at current oil prices'. He also
suggested that the dividend might be vulnerable.
The sector was a strong performer on Monday after oil ministers meeting in
Geneva had agreed to set the ceiling on their total output for the fourth
quarter at 24.5m barrels a day. However, researchers at Strauss were
negative, pointing out that quotas had not yet been determined. Thus they
were sellers of BP shares, which retreated from the day's high to close just
a penny firmer at 314p. Shell Transport also receded from the day's peak to
finish a net 3 ahead at 663p.

FT  29 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: Dividend concern at Sears
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO and CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STORES group Sears produced interim profits at the top end of expectations,
but ultimately disappointed the market as it left its dividend unchanged.
This and profit-taking after its recent good run left the stock trimmed back
3 to 115p, but still double the price of 12 months ago. Turnover was a hefty
9.9m.
In spite of the dividend disappointment, retail analysts still found plenty
to cheer in the results and a raft of profits upgrades followed. Most were
moved up around 5 per cent from the Pounds 120m area, although some 'buy'
recommendations were tempered back to 'holds' on the view that the shares
now look fully valued.
Footwear and home shopping provided the highlights, although the company was
later telling analysts that gross margins for the second half were likely to
be flat.
Ms Emma Burdett at Hoare Govett commented: 'Recovery is well under way at
Sears and there is still a lot to go for, but it may take some time to get
all the divisions back to acceptable levels of return.'

FT  29 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
DERIVATIVES markets continued to trade busily yesterday, with some of the
interest turning towards the individual share index options. Stock index
futures again led the stock market forward, and a 35 point premium against
cash on the December contract opened up the opportunity for significant
arbitrage trading.
After a slow start, the December contract strengthened again, quickly
showing the 35 point premium against the underlying market that it was to
maintain virtually thoughout the day. Dealers said that the lessening in
tensions in Russia, together with hopes for base rate cut at home, had
brought buyers back into index futures. Salomon, the US investment bank, was
an active player but was joined in arbitrage business by several UK houses.
December closed with its 35 point premium intact, showing a 24 point premium
over the fair value calculation which allows for dividend and financing
flows. Volume, at 9,428, was a shade below the previous day.
Traded options activity jumped from 23,835 contracts to 33,425, with the
FT-SE contract nearly doubling turnover to 18,907. Among stock contracts,
TSB traded 2,295 contracts on hopes that Hill Samuel, its merchant bank
subsidiary, will shortly be sold off.
The Euro FT-SE contract saw increased business to record 1,350 deals.

FT  29 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: Index futures lead share prices again
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DOMESTIC factors returned to centre stage in the UK stock market yesterday,
when hopes for a cut in base rates revived. City analysts were optimistic
that rates may be cut either ahead of the annual conference of the governing
Conservative party, or at the time of the November Budget.
International trends played a less important role, with London taking little
heed of sluggishness in other European markets or of the 24-point advance on
Wall Street overnight. The lead again came from UK stock index futures,
which maintained a strong premium against the cash market, encouraging heavy
arbitraging by the leading specialist derivatives trading houses, both
European and US.
Share prices were a shade easier at first, but quickly turned higher with
the future to show a gain of 19 points on the Footsie. The market then
settled down before attracting increased volume towards the close of
business. At the final reading of 3,036.9, the FT-SE 100 Index was 10.6
higher on the day.
The recovery of nearly 32 points on the Footsie over the past two trading
sessions has taken the Index comfortably above the 3,000 mark and restored
confidence that the 3,115 peak achieved at the end of August can be
challenged again before the year-end. Forecasts for the Footsie year-end
reading by the brokerage houses range from around 2,900 to 3,500.
Securities houses are now tidying up their trading books for the end of the
third quarter of the year. This could hold share prices back for the rest of
the week which also marks the end of the two-week trading account in
equities.
Most market firms are still taking an optimistic view of the outlook for the
final quarter, and trading volume in equities indicates that underlying
confidence has remained unshaken by the retreat from the Footsie peak.
Seaq volume, slow at first, rose smartly in the second half of the session,
to show a final total of 603.2m shares against 540.9m on Monday. Non-Footsie
business made up around 61 per cent of the total. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index,
covering a wide range of non-Footsie stocks, edged up by 0.5 to 3,437.6.
Retail, or customer, business in equities, the more significant guide to
genuine investment activity by the fund managers, has remained good. On
Monday, retail business was worth Pounds 1.25bn, within the range of the
higher value totals of the past twelve months.
The blue chip internationals remained firm although less active as the
political news from Russia continued to present a less alarming picture. Oil
shares edged higher, still sustained by crude oil prices but the
pharmaceuticals lacked conviction.
Interest rate hopes again showed in a firm performance by bank stocks.
Retail, or consumer stocks which are traditionally beneficiaries of lower
interest rates looked less certain as the sector digested company news from
two leading companies, Sears and GUS.
Neither of the two lent much support for market optimism on the company news
front. But some analysts have stressed that, while the third quarter profits
season which has just closed failed to come up to the best expectations,
there could now be good profits news in the pipeline in the final quarter of
the year.

FT  29 SEP 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Blue chips consolidate as
bonds lose steam
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By AGENCIES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
BLUE CHIP issues spent the day consolidating their position after Monday's
strength on the back of a surge in bond prices, the latter being only
slightly higher by yesterday's close. But the over-the-counter stocks set
another record peak, agencies report from New York.
Amid the currents of quarter-end window dressing, the Dow Jones Industrial
Average blue chip indicator, which finished on Monday night some 24 points
higher, drifted within an 11-point band before ending 1.68 down on the day
at 3,566.02.
The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was off 0.27 at 461.53, but the
Nasdaq composite rose 3.71 to another all-time high of 763.66 and the
American SE composite was up 0.68 at 457.12. Trading volume on the New York
SE amounted to 243m shares.
Market participants commented that there was little news to affect the
overall market, although traders were keeping a watch on developments in
Russia.
The day's economic news did not inspire activity after the Conference Board
reported that its consumer confidence index had risen to 62.6 this month
from a revised 59.3 in August.
Analysts said they did not detect much reaction in the equity market to
congressional testimony by First Lady Hillary Clinton on health care reform.
She said a national board would study the suitability of drug prices, but
not set them. One analyst said some drug stocks reacted negatively to the
pricing comments.
Bookstore chain initial public offering Barnes &amp; Noble headed the Big Board
volume list, ending at Dollars 29 3/8 after being priced at Dollars 20.
Spectrum Information jumped Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 6, topping Nasdaq
activity. It received a patent for technology connecting portable computers
to cellular telephones.
Among strong technology shares, Microsoft advanced Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars
84, while Intel rose Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars 72 3/4 , Cisco Systems Dollars
1 1/8 to Dollars 52, Novell Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 18 5/8 and SynOptics
Dollars 1 to Dollars 25 1/4 .
Canada
TORONTO stocks finished lower after moderate activity, with little to
inspire the market, and dealers said the tone would remain soft as election
uncertainty mounts. An analyst said there was a little bit of end-of-month
window dressing. The TSE 300 index was off 5.0 at 3,978.8 and declines led
advances by 377 to 326 after volume of 51.3m shares.
The 14 stock groups were evenly divided between winners and losers. The
financial services index was down 1.03 per cent. Transportation stocks
recorded the day's biggest change, falling 2.12 per cent.
BCE dipped CDollars  1/4 to CDollars 44 3/4 . Its Bell Canada unit announced
a number of cost-cutting measures designed to reduce expenses by CDollars
466m in 1994. The measures include work cutbacks equivalent to removing
5,000 employees from its workforce. Bell added that it will cut its 1994
capital budget by CDollars 300m.

FT  29 SEP 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Sentiment subdued as Frankfurt
holds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A NUMBER of bourses extended Monday's gains, but sentiment was subdued,
writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT stopped reflecting Russian tensions, and blue chips followed the
futures market as the DAX index closed just 1.43 higher at 1,913.61.
Turnover rose from DM5.9bn to DM7.2bn.
Mannesmann's rights issue left it DM7 lower at DM309.80 but Ms Barbara
Altmann, of B Metzler in Frankfurt, said that the funding had been expected
for some time.
Lower down the size scale, Linotype, the printing equipment manufacturer,
hit another new low, a drop of DM9.80 to DM320.20 leaving it down DM44.80,
or 12.3 per cent over the past three days, and 38 per cent down on its high
for this year after a domestic newspaper report said that it was closing one
of its manufacturing facilities.
PARIS saw another modest gain in the absence of major corporate news. The
CAC-40 index ended up 11.36 at 2,119.97.
Generale des Eaux lost FFr31 to FFr2,630 after denying reports in a local
newspaper that it might have been planning to raise up to FFr6bn of new
capital with a convertible issue. However, the shares closed off the day's
low of FFr2,592.
Lyonnaise-Dumez added FFr8 to FFr540 following an upgrade by James Capel.
Recommending the stock as a long-term buy the broker commented that the
measures carried out by the utility during the second half of 1992 would
appear to be 'proving sufficient to provide the group with the financial
base needed to guarantee a durable recovery in profits'.
ZURICH again found 2,500 on the SMI index too great a hurdle and prices
turned back, leaving the SMI index 4.1 lower at 2,478.3.
Recently firm chemicals were led lower by Roche certificates, down SFr50 to
SFr5,315.
Swissair shed SFr30 to SFr665 for a two day decline of 7.9 per cent amid
reports of earnings downgrades by some analysts after last week's first half
figures.
Mr Frederick Hasslauer at Swiss Volksbank noted that the resignation of Mr
Jan Carlzon from SAS to concentrate on the Alcazar alliance with KLM,
Swissair and Austrian Airlines had suggested to investors that the project
could be more difficult to implement than expected.
AMSTERDAM lost a small early gain to end unchanged, the CBS Tendency index
closing at 124.3.
ABN-Amro lost 30 cents to Fl 62.40, adding to a fall of 10 cents on Monday.
Merrill Lynch has recently upgraded the bank to a buy following recent
interim figures. The broker commented that strategic developments over the
last 12 months, centred on growth by incremental acquisition, 'illustrate an
increasingly clear-headed approach'.
MADRID extended its rally in rising volume, the general index putting on
another 1.80 to 286.77 as turnover rose from Pta13bn to around Pta18.3bn.
Mr Christopher Cooper said that the Opec agreement was good for oil prices
and Repsol, up another Pta60 to Pta3,725 for a two-day gain of Pta120.
BRUSSELS saw a fall of 3.6 per cent in Arbed, the Luxembourg steel maker,
after it forecast a full year loss of some BFr5.5bn. However, volume in the
stock was very low as it shed BFr130 to BFr3,450. The Bel-20 index rose 6.04
to 1,288.01.
MILAN blue chips reversed early gains as the market grew increasingly
nervous about results from Fiat, due late in the day, but the Comit index,
reflecting average prices throughout the session, added 9.40 or 1.6 per cent
to 602.72.
Fiat began confidently, rising to a high of L6,225 before rumours that it
planned a two-for-three rights issue at L2,000 a share began to be heard,
reviving longstanding fears. The shares finished L98 lower at L5,926.
Rinascente was suspended pending an announcement, prompting speculation that
Fiat might be planning to sell part or all of the retailer. Ifil, the
holding company seen as a possible buyer, fell L154 or 2.4 per cent to
L6,242.
ISTANBUL soared 2.5 per cent, breaking into record territory for the fourth
day in succession. The composite index closed up 391.2 at 15,777.2 in
turnover of TL2,169bn, also an all time high.
DUBLIN extended its recovery in volume considerably higher than its recently
low level, the ISEQ overall index closing 18.30 higher at 1,686.17.
Mr Adrian O'Carroll, at Dillon Read, said that the market had been pushed
into a correction by the CRH rights issue this month, which led to
profit-taking, and that CRH and financials were mainly responsible for
yesterday's gains.

FT  29 SEP 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei firms as Pacific
Rim trades quietly
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INDEX-LINKED buying of investment trusts and purchases by tokkin, or
specified money trusts, supported share prices, and the Nikkei average
firmed in spite of arbitrage unwinding, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei gained 78.61 at 20,172.72 after moving between 20,128.91 and
20,299.23. The index shed some of its morning gain in the afternoon, but
finally ended higher. Most investors ignored the meeting between Mr Morihiro
Hosokawa, Japan's prime minister, and Mr Bill Clinton, the US president,
which was held in New York on Monday.
Volume was 240m shares, against 200m. Rises led declines by 529 to 445, with
184 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks put on
2.71 at 1,623.07 and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 2.04 to
1,249.04.
The construction sector was hit by news of the arrest of Mr Shuntaro Honma,
governor of Miyagi prefecture, on Monday night on allegations of accepting
bribes of up to Y20m from contractors.
Taisei, the contractor whose officials have been arrested for alleged
bribery, fell Y6 to Y644. Other construction companies were also weak, with
Obayashi down Y4 to Y653 and Kajima losing Y8 to Y826.
Consumer-related sectors were supported by heightening hopes of an income
tax cut, while drug-related issues were bought ahead of the spate of medical
and academic meetings next month.
Retailers were higher: Daiei, the supermarket chain, advanced Y60 to Y1,550,
while Ito-Yokado climbed Y160 to Y5,450 and Jusco Y70 to Y2,450.
Housing shares were mixed, with Daikyo, a leading condominium builder,
unchanged at Y1,260, and Juken Sangyo, a processor of housing plywoods,
gaining Y40 at Y1,220.
Sankyo, a leading drug maker, added Y80 at Y3,050 and Yamanouchi
Pharmaceutical firmed Y10 to Y2,510.
Large-capital issues were lower on profit-taking: Nippon Steel receded Y8 to
Y307 and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Y13 to Y657.
Shiseido, the cosmetics company, eased Y10 to Y1,310 after the Tokyo
district court ruled that the cancellation of a shipment contract with a
discount retailer by the company's sales subsidiary could be a violation of
the anti-monopoly law.
In Osaka, the OSE average rose 105.47 to 22,292.71 in volume of 58.9m
shares. The index was supported by purchases in pharmaceutical and
biotechnology-related shares.
Roundup
TRADING WAS subdued in many of the Pacific Rim markets. Taiwan was closed
for a public holiday.
HONG KONG saw a late round of institutional buying offset light
profit-taking and push stocks to a modestly higher close. The Hang Seng
index finished 18.41 ahead at 7,470.50. Turnover was a relatively thin
HKDollars 2.12bn, with investors cautious ahead of a meeting on Friday of
the foreign ministers of China and Britain to discuss Hong Kong's political
reform plans.
Overseas institutions focused on blue chips, taking HSBC up 50 cents to
HKDollars 79.50. Cheung Kong rose 10 cents to HKDollars 27 and China Light
25 cents to HKDollars 43.50.
AUSTRALIA was nervous ahead of the release of the August balance of payments
data and the All Ordinaries index eased 0.7 to 1,942.3 in thin volume of
179m shares.
NEW ZEALAND edged forward in quiet trading, with a lack of institutional
interest ahead of the quarter's end.
The NZSE-40 Capital index closed 6.22 firmer at 1,929.95 in turnover of
NZDollars 23m.
SEOUL recouped early losses to finish higher before the public holiday which
will see the market closed until Saturday. The composite index added 1.04 at
718.87.
BOMBAY moved higher in spite of profit-taking in a session restricted to one
hour, against the normal two, to enable settlement in cash shares. The BSE
30-share index advanced 9.58 to 2,750.04.
SINGAPORE saw activity in speculative Malaysian shares traded over the
counter in otherwise quiet trading, as the Straits Times Industrial index
eased 0.21 to 1,989.14.
KUALA LUMPUR closed off the day's highs after profit-taking became more
pronounced in the afternoon, although a late surge in Telekom Malaysia
lifted the composite index from the day's low of 846.61 to finish 3.74 up at
849.92. Telekom firmed 30 cents to MDollars 17.10.
KARACHI ended higher after the announcement of good corporate results, and
the KSE index rose 2.67 to 1,342.85.

FT  29 SEP 93 / World Stock Markets: Mexican investors await US decision on
Nafta - A turbulent progress for equities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the next few months, Mexico's stock market is expected to boom or bust,
depending on how 435 US congressmen and women, and 100 US senators, cast
their votes on the proposed North American Free Trade Agreement.
That, at least, appears to be the prevailing view. At the end of last week
the IPC index retreated again, closing nearly 1 per cent down on the week
after Mr Richard Gephardt, House majority leader, said that he would be
voting against Nafta.
Mexico has been one of the laggards among the IFC's emerging markets indices
this year, showing a rise of around 4 per cent in dollar terms. The market
stood slightly weaker at midsession yesterday.
The market has been subjected constantly to the whims of the Nafta debate,
with good news, such as the completion of the parallel agreements in mid
August, leading to a rally while recent bad news, such as the unexpectedly
strong congressional opposition to the treaty earlier this month, triggered
a decline.
The treaty is scheduled to come into effect on January 1, 1994 but, given
the opposition from US Democrats, delay or even rejection remains distinctly
possible.
Investors view such an event with alarm, believing that it would force
domestic interest rates up in the short term, slow down economic growth, and
heighten uncertainties over future economic policies.
'The market is on a knife edge,' says Mr Jonathan Heath, head of Macro
Asesoria Economica. 'Depending on the outcome of Nafta it could go up or
down by 20 per cent.'
Mr Heath is also director of research for Serfin Securities, which has a
Nafta warrant that gives an investor the right to buy a put or call option
on five leading Mexican stocks on January 10. If stocks rise or fall between
now and then by more than 20 per cent, the warrant makes money.
Other observers recommend Nafta hedge stocks - shares that will do well, or
not so badly, if the treaty is rejected by the US congress. Such stocks tend
to be those that would benefit, or be unaffected, by a rise in interest
rates, a weakening of the currency, or a reduction in trade.
Mr Carlos Fritsch of SG Warburg Securities points to Vitro, the glass
company, which has more than half of its sales in dollars, and Cifra, the
country's largest retailer, which has no debt and is domestically
orientated; while Lazard Freyes likes tourism and mining companies.
Those confident of Nafta's eventual passage will want to pick up bargains
while there is still time. Brokers tend to recommend Cemex and ICA (both
holding plenty of foreign debt), the banks (sensitive to interest rates) and
transport companies like TMM, which is dependent on trade, as Nafta winners.
The next Nafta development is likely to come when President Bill Clinton
sends the treaty to congress, which he is expected to do before November 1.
Such a decision will commit Mr Clinton irreversibly to Nafta, says Mr
Fritsch, and may be taken as evidence that he believes the treaty can be
passed by congress.
Some investors complain that the market's obsession with Nafta has been
overdone. Other factors have undoubtedly moved the market this year,
especially the squeeze on corporate earnings. Unlike Argentina's, and
Chile's, Mexico's economy is currently stagnant, showing growth of just 0.3
per cent in the second quarter, compared with 1.8 per cent in the same 1992
period.
Even without Nafta, Mr Heath and other economists expect the economy to grow
by around 3 per cent next year, to coincide with presidential elections next
August. President Carlos Salinas has recently suggested that the government
will increase spending modestly by using up the budget surplus earned in the
first half of the year, while Dollars 22.6bn of reserves gives the central
bank room to lower interest rates at some stage.
'Nafta is completely concealing what are some very strong fundamentals in
favour of Mexico,' says Mr Geoffrey Dennis, head of emerging markets
research for Bear Stearns in New York. Bear Stearns values Mexico's stock
market at 11.9 times 1993 earnings, making it relatively cheap compared to a
multiple of 16.5 in Argentina, and 14 in Chile.
While Mr Dennis readily concedes that rejection of Nafta would hurt the
market in the short term, he doubts that there would be any significant
change in Mexico's pro-market economic policy, or any pressure on the
exchange rate if the treaty were not approved. He bravely tells clients that
there is a greater exchange risk in buying the German D-Mark than in the
Mexican peso.

FT  29 SEP 93 / Money Markets: Sterling futures fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STERLING interest rate fut-ures fell sharply yesterday, as the pound
suffered a decline against the D-Mark on the foreign exchanges, writes James
Blitz.
The pound's fall against the D-Mark was partly due to worries about next
week's Conservative party conference in Blackpool, at which Mr John Major,
the UK prime minister, will come under pressure.
Any drop in the currency, in turn, tends to raise some doubt about whether
the authorities have room to engineer another easing in monetary policy. The
December short sterling contract lost 5 basis points to close at 94.39.
In the sterling cash market, three-month interest rates remained very high
at around 6 per cent. This was mostly due to end-of-month factors which put
pressure on banks to meet liquidity requirements.
Conditions in the discount market were a great deal easier. Most of a Pounds
900m shortage in the banking system was removed through regular operations.
The cost of overnight funds was as low as 2 per cent at one stage.
In the German market, there were no surprises in the Bundesbank announcement
of a 6.70 per cent repo for 14-day maturities in its money market
operations.
More surprising, however, was the decision to go for a 33-day variable rate
repo. This was seen by many dealers as an indication that conditions in the
German market are getting back to normal.
The recent reduction in the discount rate to 6.25 per cent has made it
possible for the Bundesbank to auction for liquidity. Bids often tend to
come in levels lower than call money.
There were signs yesterday that bank dealers were trying to obtain funds as
cheaply as possible, with some bids coming below 6.70 per cent.
In the German interest rate futures market, the contracts were down in spite
of better than expected figures on German inflation. The Decem-ber contract
declined 3 basis points to finish at 93.90.
The December French franc contract was little changed at 93.70. Dealers
continue to think that there could be an easing in the French intervention
rate in the near future, although yesterday's weakness in the French
currency may make this a little more difficult to execute. The intervention
rate has remained at 6.75 per cent since the European exchange rate
mechanism crisis.

FT  29 SEP 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Revised views on rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOLLAR lost two pfennigs against the D-Mark yesterday amid continuing
signs that the Russian crisis was calming down and that there would be
little immediate narrowing in the interest rate differential between Germany
and the US, writes James Blitz.
President Boris Yeltsin's continuing grip on the political situation in
Moscow was bound to lead to a decline in the dollar's safe haven status. But
yesterday's fall, which took the dollar from a morning peak in Europe of
DM1.6320 to an evening low of DM1.6130, reflected factors that may have been
more substantial than a simple shift in short term funds. It closed in New
York at DM1.6123.
Instead, the dollar's fall was rooted in a growing reassessment of the
outlook for US and German interest rates. The story of the last 18 months in
currency markets has been one of continuing disappointment for those who
expect US rates to go up and German ones to come down. It was the same story
yesterday.
Speculation that US rates may descend one more time has mainly been
triggered by publication of minutes of the recent meeting of the Federal
Reserve's Open Market Committee, which saw a move from a tightening stance
to one of 'neutral'. The US economy's sluggishness is clearly making
American policymakers less concerned about inflation.
It may be, too, that the recent cut in the Japanese official discount rate
to 1.75 per cent has had some effect. Dealers are beginning to see just how
cheap money can be when the central bank in an industrialised country wants
to stimulate the economy.
In Germany, the outlook for lower rates is by no means certain. There will
probably be no easing in official rates for three weeks. Mr Hans Tietmeyer's
first council meeting as Bundesbank president in 10 days' time is unlikely
to coincide with an easing of policy.
The outlook for German consumer price inflation is good, for sure. The
cost-of-living data in the state of Hesse, for example, showed an increase
of 0.2 per cent in September, giving a year-on-year rise of 4.2 per cent,
the same as it was in the year to August.
But dollar investors took fright yesterday when Mr Dieter Hiss, a Bundesbank
council member, said he saw little chance of the inflation rate falling
below 4 per cent in the near future. That caution led to D-Mark strength
against most European currencies. Sterling finished at DM2.4525 from a
previous DM2.4650.
It also helped to trigger a fall in the dollar/yen rate. The yen's rise may
have been due to short term investment flows, with Japanese banks
repatriating dollars before the month's end. But another factor may have
been surprise at how little came out of the meeting between President
Clinton and Prime Minister Hosokawa at their Monday summit. The dollar
closed at Y105.25, down from Y105.85. In New York it ended at Y105.00.

FT  29 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Rubber pact calls for Dollars
60m boost
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   KUALA LUMPUR
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE BUFFER stock manager of the International Natural Rubber Organisation
has made a MDollars 150m (Dollars 60m) cash call to organisation members to
finance a renewed effort to prop up natural rubber prices.
Members have 60 days to respond to the request.
With prices now 30 per cent lower in real terms than they were six years
ago, the buffer stock manager wants extra funds to buy in rubber from an
oversupplied world market. At present the Inro stockpile is about 200,000
tonnes.
Market analysts say that with producer and consumer countries locked in a
battle about the future of the international rubber trading system a
positive response to the cash call is by no means certain. The present
International Natural Rubber Agreement expires in three months. Producer
members want its terms renegotiated but the consumers want the present
agreement to continue.
A final decision on the future of Inra is likely to be made when Inro
council members meet here in November.

CANADA'S PLACER Dome has identified 150 tonnes (about 4.8m troy ounces) of
proven reserves of gold in Venezuela's traditional gold mining zone,
according to a report published yesterday in Economia Hoy, a Caracas
newspaper.
The report, which could not be confirmed immediately, said that the
newly-identified reserves lay in a mining concession called Las Cristinas
that Placer Dome shared with the CVG, a large industrial and mining company
owned by the Venezuelan government.
The concession area is to the south of the evocatively-named town of El
Dorado in the south-eastern state of Bolivar, where Venezuela's gold mining
activities are concentrated. Ore in the deposit holds 1.32 grammes of gold
per tonne, according to the report.
The deposit is about 2km long and lies at a depth of some 200m. It was found
after two years of prospecting and investment outlays of about USDollars
10m.
Depending on the extraction technique used, Placer Dome could produce up to
15 tonnes a year, the report said. That would far outstrip production by the
government's gold mining company, Minerven, which reached just over 2 tonnes
last year.
Venezuela's great potential for gold has been well known for many years, but
large-scale commercial development of both subterranean and sedimentary
deposits has been delayed, usually because of concerns over the legal status
of concessions, outdated mining laws and tax issues, among other reasons.
Shares in Samantha Gold were suspended at the company's request yesterday
after the Western Australian gold mining company reported a new gold
discovery at its main Higginsville prospect, to the east of Pioneer Dome,
writes Nikki Tait in Sydney.
Samantha said that follow-up drilling in its joint venture with Geographe
Resources and Great Southern Mines was obtaining 'very significant' results.
It commented that assay results indicated 'very strong values over the 80m
strike length tested to date, with wide mineralisation widths'. The company
added that these initial results indicated the first significant gold
discovery on that side of the Pioneer Dome site.
'The drill intersections are the best that Samantha has encountered since it
commenced operations at Higginsville and the new tenement areas are
considered to have substantial potential for further discoveries,' it said.
The company's shares are expected to start trading again today.

FT  29 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Buyers losing taste for
expensive natural vanilla - Overpricing is costing market share for
Madagascar's high quality product
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR GUILD

<DATELINE>
   THE INCINERATION ends, but the producers are still the big loosers
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
that was how one local newspaper headlined the recent destruction of 1,700
tonnes of vanilla stocks in the north-east of Madagascar.
Madagascar's vanilla, the country's number one export by value, fetches top
prices of more than USDollars 70 a kilogram. But the grower sees precious
little of that - the official farmgate price last year was MgFr2,000
(Dollars 1.04) for 1kg of pods.
In the 1960s a vanilla price stabilisation fund was established with the
intention of channelling investment into the industry. But it receives only
a small proportion of the 80 per cent levy on the export price. A growing
amount has been spent on keeping stocks, and much of the stockpile is
thought to be of either poor quality or 'phantom' pods. The cost of keeping
stocks increased from MgFr10m in 1980 to MgFr9bn in 1990, and the bulk of
what is left of the levy has been disappearing into the national treasury.
While the government has sought to control every aspect of vanilla
production, illicit exports of vanilla have been growing, a reflection of
declining morale, particularly among farmers. This year, unauthorised
shipments turned up in Singapore, Holland and France. This has been mostly
inferior quality vanilla, picked too early and offered at low prices,
undermining confidence among the major holders of vanilla stocks in
industrialised countries.
Vanilla was first introduced to Madagascar in the 1840s. Annual rainfall on
the north-east coast where the growing and processing are concentrated is
2,000mm, evenly spread over the year. Temperatures range from 18' C to 32'
C.
There are now about 55,000 farmers growing vanilla in Madagascar. The
cultivation and processing of the crop is skilled and labour intensive. A
skilled worker can pollinate between 1,000 and 1,500 flowers in a day, but
if over-pollinated a vine will yield small and low quality pods. Curing
takes many months of sorting, 'killing', sweating, drying, conditioning and
meticulous inspection to induce the development of the full aroma and
flavour.
Madagascar has built its reputation on its knowhow. It also has the labour
and production costs are low, estimated at less than Dollars 15 a kilogram,
compared with Dollars 35 for Indonesian vanilla and over Dollars 40 in the
Comores. Vanilla production is so labour intensive, that rapidly
industrialising countries, with increasing labour costs such as Mexico have
had to reassess their involvement with the crop.
But Madagascar has been rapidly losing its market share. In the early 1970s,
it supplied 70 per cent of the vanilla consumed worldwide. By the early
1990s, its share was down to 50 per cent. High prices and now illicit
shipments of poor quality vanilla are prompting consumers to look for
cheaper alternative sources.
The Indonesian government has been encouraging farmers to start growing
vanilla. It is also seeking to improve the quality of its pods, in
particular, to increase the aroma flavour, strength and character. For
instance, it is trying to educate farmers not to pick pods early. The curers
and Indonesian research institutes are working with the British Natural
Resources Institute to improve curing techniques, and in particular the
measuring of moisture content.
Vanilla production in Uganda, which ceased during the political upheavals of
the 1970s, is rising again. There are already more than 10,000 farmers
growing the crop and the price they receive is almost three times that paid
to growers in Madagascar. One of Uganda's processors, which produces two
thirds of the country's vanilla, uses a method of rapid curing, introduced
by the US spice company McCormicks. This cuts the curing time from six
months to four days. And the vanillin content is twice that of pods cured by
the traditional Bourbon method as used in Madagascar.
The high price of Madagascar's vanilla has been largely to blame also for
the increasing partial substitution of other natural aromas for vanilla and
the switch to cheaper synthetic vanillin flavourings. The cheapest, Chinese
vanillin has been selling at Dollars 11 a kilogram.
In the US, which consumes 60 per cent of the world's natural vanilla,
vanillin now takes more than 90 per cent of the market for that aroma and in
France it supplies about 50 per cent of the market.
'We've been selling a product which every year has been getting worse and
worse,' says the director of one of the largest vanilla exporters in
Madagascar.
'A lot of the experienced planters have been giving up vanilla, so the basic
structure from which new farmers could learn has been collapsing.'
This year, the government agreed to improve incentives to growers,
processors and exporters, doubling the proportion of the export levy they
receive over the next three years. But it has yet to agree to a
liberalisation of the sector, and in particular of pricing. According to a
World Bank report in 1991, Madagascar's vanilla would be more realistically
priced at about Dollars 50 a kilogram, the price of Indonesia's best quality
pods.
Liberalisation is being resisted, particularly by the large exporters. 'For
the past 30 years, Madagascar has managed to secure pretty much the price it
wanted. The effect of telling the country to liberalise has been to
destabilise the whole situation,' says the director of one vanilla exporting
company.
'In the short term freeing of prices might benefit the consumers, but sooner
or later the quality would be bound to suffer.'
Judging by market reports from the US, there is now a trend towards natural
vanilla in an increasingly health and environment conscious food industry,
especially in premium brand ice creams and drinks.
Vanilla is the only flavour specifically defined by the Food and Drug
Administration. According to FDA guidelines a product labelled natural
vanilla should use pure vanilla extract.
But according to the World Bank, Madagascar risks becoming a residual
supplier of the flavouring, supplying the market only when crops in other
countries fail. Unless it takes drastic action, says the bank, Madagascar
could cease being a vanilla exporter altogether by the end of the 1990s.

FT  29 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Copper close to six-year lows
as stocks surge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LONDON METAL Exchange copper prices came under renewed pressure yesterday
from investment fund selling and was forced the market to retest the lows
reached last week in the aftermath of the sudden ending of the recent
technical supply squeeze.
With sentiment further depressed by news of another big rise in exchange
warehouse stocks of the metal the three months price fell by Dollars 42 to
Dollars 1,735 a tonne at one stage, just Dollars 2 above last Tuesday's near
six-year low. But support was again found at that level, largely from other
investment funds, which had already sold the market short and were now
making covering purchases. The price ended after-hours trading at Dollars
1,738.50 a tonne.
While copper's fundamentals remained far from encouraging, market operators
might be adopting a more cautious approach because of a growing awareness
that the market could soon become seriously oversold, Mr Ted Arnold, metals
analyst at the Merrill Lynch financial services group, suggested. He pointed
out that supplies of copper scrap tended to 'dry up' if the price price
moved much below 80 US cents a lb - yesterday's close worked out at 79 cents
a lb. At that price the flow of toll refined metal from the former Soviet
Union might also be expected to slacken, Mr Arnold added.
A study of the copper market published this week points out, however, that
more than 90 per cent of western world copper mine production was at cash
costs of below 80 cents a lb in 1992, while much of the new capacity
encouraged by relatively high prices for the metal in recent years uses the
low-cost solvent extraction or electrowinning technology.
AME Mineral Economics says in its report, Copper 1993 - Growth but no Cheer,
that this SX-EW capacity 'will stay in production regardless of copper
prices'. It also suggests that the former eastern bloc, which exported
nearly 450,000 tonnes of copper to the West last year, is 'another source of
inelastic supply'.
On the demand side AME sees newly industrialising Asian economies continuing
to be a strong growth area for copper. East Asia is already the leading
consumer of the metal, with demand having increased between 1980 and 1992 at
an average annual compound rate of 5.2 per cent, compared with 2 per cent in
Europe and 0.8 per cent in the US, the report points out. And the region's
economy is 'forecast to grow at one and a half times the world average in
future decades'.
AME concludes: 'These two forces in concert will usher in a period a period
of relatively strong growth in copper consumption in association with a
ratcheting down of price expectations. Despite the positive outlook for
copper offtake in Asia, new low-cost sources of supply will hold prices down
to 90 cents a lb or less over the next five years'.

COCOA prices jumped back from their morning lows in fairly active trading at
the London Commodity Exchange. 'Some people were waiting for a sell-off but
there was more buying than selling,' one trader said, adding there there was
still sign of producer sales. The December futures price dipped to Pounds
892 a tonne at one stage but closed at Pounds 913 a tonne, up Pounds 9 on
the day. The robusta COFFEE market also managed to pull back from its lows,
but still ended the day with the November futures position Dollars 11 down
at Dollars 1,245 a tonne. Traders said that at the lows (Dollars 1,235 for
November delivery) there was no follow-through selling and there was a
little support from roaster interest. 'The market is looking weak. It should
by rights move lower,' one said. At the London Metal Exchange NICKEL and TIN
prices added to Monday's losses. Yet another stock increase depressed the
nickel market before trade-based support helped it to move back above the
Dollars 4,200-a-tonne level. Tin was pressured by persistent sales from US
Defence Logistics Agency stocks and dull demand.

FT  29 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Harvest hopes push Chicago
soyabean futures lower
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CHIACGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PROSPECTS FOR fine harvesting weather in the US pushed soyabean prices lower
at the Chicago Board of Trade yesterday and overshadowed forecasts for the
season's first killing frost. In late trading the January futures position,
which had fallen by 8 1/4 cents on Monday, was down another 8 1/2 cents at
637 cents a bushel.
'I'm forecasting open weather this week, and that will give the combines a
chance to roll,' said Merrill Lynch's chief meteorologist, Mr Thad Chupalio.
The dry weather will be welcomed by farmers, many of whom experienced
drenching, harvest-stalling rains last weekend.
Although Mr Chupalio and many other forecasters are predicting that there
will be a freeze over much of the central US maize and soyabean growing
regions, including central Illinois, by Thursday, traders have already taken
account of potential frost losses in their assessments of the market.
Soyabean prices have been creeping higher on frost fears since early
September, contrary to a seasonal tendency for prices to slump as harvest
approaches.
The higher prices may have discouraged export sales of the new crop. 'We
will lose some bushels to a freeze, but we will lose as much or more in
offsetting export demand,' says Mr Dan Cekander, a crop analyst with the
Chicago brokerage firm Rodman and Renshaw.
Mr Cekander expects US soyabean and meal exports to the European Community
to drop by as much as 7 per cent this year as the community's farmers switch
from soyameal to less expensive livestock feeds.
US soya products also face stiff competition from other producers. Brazilian
farmers begin seeding soyabeans this week, and could be encouraged to
broaden plantings if world prices, as reflected on the Chicago Board of
Trade, remain firm.
US soyabean exports in September are running nearly 50 per cent behind 1992
levels and export sales of the new crop beans are lagging by a similar
amount.
'Our export inspections were only half of what we need to meet the
government's export estimates,' said Mr Richard Feltes, senior analyst for
the Refco trade house.
The export figures, which were released in a weekly report Monday, prompted
many traders, including big futures funds, to lighten their holdings of
soyabean futures. The data showed only 20.7m bushels of soyabeans had left
US ports for export destinations since September 1, compared with 48m
bushels a year ago.

FT  29 SEP 93 / Government Bonds: Treasury price gains eroded by retail
sales figures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON and CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER posting solid early gains, US Treasury prices fell back yesterday
following reports of strong September store sales.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  1/32 at 104
3/16 , yielding 5.94 per cent. Shorter-dated securities traded mostly flat
throughout the day.
After Monday's big gains, when the 30-year issue climbed more than one
point, the bond market maintained its firm tone at the opening. Reports of
strong demand for Treasuries in overseas markets, especially Tokyo, set the
stage for early advances, and only the short end of the market, which has
been ignored lately, failed to move higher in early trading.
The market was strong enough initially to shrug off some potentially bearish
news from the Conference Board, which announced that its September index of
consumer confidence rose to 62.6 this month from 59.3 in August.
However, prices fell back later in the day after the Johnson Redbook service
reported a 10.2 per cent increase in retail store sales for the first four
selling weeks of September.
EUROPEAN bonds posted further gains, supported by the rally in the US as
well as continuing hopes for near-term European rate cuts. Prices in most
markets returned to the levels at which they had been trading just before
political turmoil broke out in Russia last week.
UK gilts continued to firm, in spite of imminent supply at today's auction
of Pounds 3.25bn of new 6 3/4 per cent gilts due 2004. The bonds have gained
nearly one point in grey-market trading since their announcement last week,
which had some dealers fearing that the price might be too high to attract
the overseas demand needed to make the auction a success.
However, most dealers were confident the auction would go smoothly. 'The
market has a good bid to it, and the auction should go well,' said Mr Jan
Laury, head of gilts sales at Daiwa.
He expected gilts to firm further if the auction is a success. However, the
pound, which is dogged by political jitters ahead of next week's
Conservative Party conference, remains a risk for gilts.
GERMAN bonds posted small gains, spurred largely by the breach of important
technical resistance on the December bund future.
After opening at 98.81, the contract broke through 99.00 and hit a high of
99.18 before closing at 99.04.
Comments from Mr Dieter Hiss, Bundesbank central bank council member, who
said that he did not foresee inflation coming below 4 per cent soon, briefly
damped prices but had little lasting impact. He also said the yield curve
would remain inverted until inflation had normalised to around half its
current rate.
'His comments are not encouraging for easing prospects, though they are
supportive for the long end,' said a Frankfurt dealer.
FRENCH bonds gained on continuing talk of near-term rate cuts, with traders
pinning their easing hopes on Thursday's Bank of France repo. Prices were
further lifted when the notional French bond future on Matif breached its
previous historical high at 123.72, rallied as high as 123.96 and closed at
123.82.
The French government's auction of Ecu1.05bn 6 per cent 10-year OATs was 2
1/2 times oversubscribed and met with solid demand, said a London dealer.
BELGIAN bonds were the day's poorest performer, dogged by currency weakness.
The Belgian 10-year benchmark's yield spread over its German counterpart
widened to 127 basis points from 115 on Monday.
According to Mr Andre de Silva, bond strategist with Paine Webber, Belgium
was still overrated, especially when compared to Italy where bonds yesterday
rallied to new highs on strong volume.
The Moody's rating agency rates Belgium Aa1, better than Italy's A1, but Mr
de Silva said 'it is not unreasonable to moot the possibility of either a
Belgian downgrade or an Italian upgrade'.
Belgium's debt-to-GDP ratio of 130 per cent is clearly above Italy's 110 per
cent ratio, he noted. Also, Italy has been taking far more stringent
measures to deliver fiscal tightening than Belgium, he said.

FT  29 SEP 93 / International Capital Markets: Midland Bank issues first
preferred stock
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MIDLAND Bank, the UK clearing bank owned by HSBC Holdings, yesterday
launched its first offering of preferred stock, which counts as Tier 1
capital under Basle capital adequacy rules, writes Tracy Corrigan. The
offering consists of a Dollars 250m issue of non-cumulative preference
shares, arranged by Merrill Lynch and placed with US retail investors.
Midland is well-capitalised with a total capital ratio of 11.4 per cent as
at June 30 - well above the 8 per cent minimum requirement - of which 6.5
per cent is Tier 1 capital. However, all of Midland's existing Tier 1
capital is denominated in sterling and the bank has substantial dollar
assets.

FT  29 SEP 93 / International Capital Markets: Bank supervisor calls for
tougher futures regulation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A LEADING international bank supervisor has called for separately
capitalised subsidiaries of securities houses which trade financial
derivatives such as swaps and options to be brought under regulatory control
in the US.
Mr Brian Quinn, executive director of the Bank of England, said he could see
no justification for derivatives subsidiaries of US banks and securities
houses not to be covered by consolidated supervision of the parent.
Mr Quinn made his call in a speech in which he warned of potential risks to
the stability of the financial system from the rapid growth in the Dollars
4,500bn market in over-the-counter derivatives traded by banks and
securities firms.
Mr Quinn, who was speaking at a seminar organised in Washington by the G30
group of banks and financial institutions, criticised part of a recent
derivatives study sponsored by G30 as 'somewhat complacent' over systemic
risk.
Mr Quinn's caution was supported by other supervisors. Mr William McDonough,
president of the New York Federal Reserve Bank said that it appeared that
credit risk was not yet fully reflected in the pricing of derivatives.
Separately, Mr Eugene Ludwig, the US comptroller of the currency and
administrator of 3,500 nationally chartered banks, called for the creation
of a task force to examine banks' derivatives activities.
Mr Ludwig said in a speech to the International Institute of Bankers that
national banks involved in derivatives should adopt 'no surprises'
techniques of risk management that were 'made concrete in systems and
controls'.
Mr Quinn's call for derivatives units to be regulated follows the
establishment of such units by Merrill Lynch and Salomon Brothers. Under US
law, they are not subject to regulation by the Securities and Exchange
Commission.
Mr Quinn said that the section of the G30 report on systemic risk 'struck me
as somewhat complacent' and the rapid growth of derivatives could be leading
to credit risk problems similar to less developed country debt.
He said the growth of banks seeking to enter the market could outstrip the
number of traders expert enough to handle derivatives. If so, 'there can
only be trouble ahead. Derivatives trading is for grown-ups,' he said.
He said the G30 report's assertion that market participants should judge for
themselves whether to deal with unregulated units 'certainly makes one stop
and blink'.
Sir Dennis Weatherstone, chairman of JP Morgan and the leader of the G30
study said the study had concentrated most on other aspects of risk, but
added that on systemic risk 'if several people thought it was complacent, it
probably was'.

FT  29 SEP 93 / International Bonds: GECC draws German interest with L200bn
offering
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE was a lull in the international bond market yesterday as the
International Monetary Fund meetings continued in Washington. However, the
volume of new issues is expected to pick up markedly in the next few weeks.
Belgium is likely to launch a five-year Eurobond issue of between Dollars
400m and Dollars 500m in the first half of October. Some syndicate managers
said that the sovereign borrower could achieve a better execution through an
offering of floating-rate notes (FRNs), as opposed to a fixed-rate deal.
News that Finland had made a Dollars 2bn shelf registration with the US
Securities and Exchange Commission on Friday has fuelled speculation that a
global offering will be launched soon, in spite of denials from the Finnish
finance ministry.
The European Community is reported to be considering a Eurobond issue of up
to DM2bn, or the equivalent in Ecus, while the Spanish region of Andalucia
is thought to be seeking to raise D-Marks or French francs.
Megal, the Franco-German gas pipeline group which has been absent from the
Euromarket since 1989, is looking to raise D-Marks.
Among yesterday's offerings, GECC launched a L200bn offering of five-year
Eurobonds, the proceeds of which were thought to have been swapped into
fixed-rate dollars at an all-in cost of 15 basis points below the London
interbank offered rate (Libor).
Some syndicate managers said the bonds were tightly priced but an official
at lead manager Paribas said the pricing was in line with secondary market
levels. The bonds traded at 99.75 in the afternoon, comfortably within fees.
The Paribas official said that there was particular demand for the bonds
from Germany but that investors in Switzerland and the Benelux countries had
expressed an interest.
Continued investor demand for high-yielding paper ensured an enthusiastic
reception for Philippine National Oil Company's (PNOC) first Eurobond issue.
Demand was such that the five-year offering raised Dollars 90m, compared
with a planned amount of Dollars 60m.
The bonds were priced to yield 265 basis points over the 4 3/4 per cent US
Treasury due 1998, well below the indicated yield spread of 270 to 290 basis
points.
Trading in the bonds opened at 100.50, well above the re-offer price of
99.63, and there were reports that the bonds traded briefly above 101.
An official at the lead manager JP Morgan said that over half of the bonds
were sold to investors in Asia Pacific while the remainder was divided
equally between Europe and the US. Private clients and emerging market funds
featured among the buyers.
PNOC's issue is expected to be followed by a five-year deal of about Dollars
150m from Philippine National Power Company, via Morgan Stanley.
The spread on the issue is expected to be tighter than PNOC's offering,
because it will be guaranteed by the government.
Continued demand for FRNs enabled Spintab, the Swedish domestic mortgage
association owned by Swedbank, to raise a further Dollars 100m by re-opening
its Dollars 250m FRN offering which was launched in late August.
Nordic borrowers have enjoyed a significant improvement in the spreads they
have to pay in the Eurobond market as investors take a more balanced view on
the region's creditworthiness.

FT  29 SEP 93 / International Company News: Losses deepen at Snecma in first
half
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SNECMA, the French state-owned aircraft engine manufacturer, yesterday
reported increased net losses for the first half of 1993 and said it had
completed a plan to raise FFr759m (Dollars 133.15m) in new capital.
The new capital will come principally from the French government. But United
Technologies Corporation of the US, which controls Pratt and Whitney, the US
aero-engine group, will also subscribe in order to maintain its share of
Snecma at 1.73 per cent.
Pratt and Whitney and Snecma have co-operated on several projects since the
US group took its stake in the French company. Co-operation has centred on
engines for regional transport and small business jets.
Snecma blamed the rise in six-month net losses - from FFr302.7m to FFr351m -
on the depressed state of the civil and military aviation markets. Sales
fell sharply, declining by 18 per cent to FFr5bn.
The deterioration in the international aviation market was shown in figures
issued by Snecma. These showed the average production of CFM56 civil
aviation engines, which was 880 in 1991 and 770 in 1992, is expected to be
around 500 in 1993 and to decrease over the next few years.
Faced with the continued weakness in international markets, the group said
that there was unlikely to be a significant difference in performance in the
current half year. The group is expected to report a net loss for 1993 as a
whole.
However, a spokesman for Snecma said that the decline in the net result
disguised a strong performance in operating profits, which recovered from a
loss last year of FFr46m to a surplus of FFr125m.
According to Snecma, this recovery reflected the impact of rationalisation
and cost-cutting measures. Like many French public sector companies, the
group is in the middle of a cost-cutting plan.

FT  29 SEP 93 / International Company News: First Chinese flotation on
Australian stock market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AUSTRALIA and China may have battled for the right to host the 2000 Olympic
Games. But yesterday relationships between the two countries struck a more
harmonious note, as the first Chinese company was floated on the Australian
stock market.
Guangdong Corporation (GDC) made its debut on the Australian Stock Exchange
at 11am, and watched its shares go to an immediate 27 cents premium over the
offer price of 78 cents. At one stage, the shares hit ADollars 1.10,
although they later eased back from these levels. Around 9.6m shares had
been up for sale, raising ADollars 7.5m (USDollars 4.9m).
In Melbourne, Sino Securities International, which underwrote the share
issue, claimed that there had been 'interest from the Chinese community,
both within Australia and in Asia'. Just over half the investors in the
issue had been Australian, calculated Mr Richard Li, managing director, with
the balance coming from Singapore, Malaysia, Hong Kong, and elsewhere.
To date, the only Chinese listings to occur overseas, outside of Hong Kong,
have taken place in New York. In Australia, a handful of Chinese companies -
like Brilliance Automotive - have floated over the past year, although the
vehicles involved have generally been associated with foreign joint venture
companies. GDC, by contrast, is backed by the government of Guangdong
Province, the region close to Hong Kong and a relatively prosperous area of
China.
GDC's ownership structure is complex. Following the flotation, 64 per cent
of its equity is held by Guangdong Investment (GI); another 28 per cent by
the newly introduced public investors; and 8 per cent by GDC's managing
director, Mr Paul Tsui.
GI is itself listed in Hong Kong. However, almost half its shares are owned
by Guangdong Enterprises (GE) which, in turn, is ultimately controlled by
the government of Guangdong Province. The stated aim of both GI and GE is
the economic development of Guangdong.
GDC, however, has 'normal' commercial objectives. Its main operating
business is called Full Arts Metal Works, and was founded by Mr Tsui in
1978. This specialises in supplying 'curtain wall' systems and industrial
cladding to construction companies.
In the year ended March, GDC had sales of about ADollars 21m, and most of
its main 'curtain wall' revenue was derived from Hong Kong.
According to the prospectus, GDC would like to reach a point where more than
half group sales are sourced in China, with Hong Kong making up the
remainder. GDC's operating profit last year was ADollars 2.71m.
GDC is no colossus, and the amounts of outside capital sought in the issue
were small. However, Mr Li maintains that the decision to list in Australia
was at least partly motivated by the fact that trading would be conducted in
an Asian time zone, and that the country contains a large Chinese community.
Not unnaturally, he hopes that other Chinese companies will follow suit: 'I
would expect to see more listed on Western exchanges, and after this, I'd
expect more to come to Australia.'

FT  29 SEP 93 / International Company News: Ugine plans to increase capital
of US unit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
UGINE, part of the Usinor Sacilor French state-owned steel group, plans to
increase the capital of its US stainless steel operation and float part of
the company on the New York stock market.
Mr Philippe Chopping de Janvry, chairman of Ugine, said the capital raised
would be in the order of 'hundreds of millions of dollars'.
He said it would be used to reduce debt of around FFr6.5bn (Dollars 1.14bn),
and finance investments at J&amp;L Specialty Products, the US stainless steel
operation.
Ugine will raise the capital through the sale of 15.6m shares in Specialty
Materials Corp (SMC), which holds 100 per cent of J&amp;L.
It plans to offer 40 per cent of SMC through a capital increase, and 60 per
cent through the issue of shares it already owns.
Ugine said that SMC and J&amp;L will be merged as part of its reorganisation of
US activities. The French group will keep between 50 and 55 per cent of the
new company, to be called J&amp;L Specialty Steel.
In addition to the capital raising and reorganisation in the US, Ugine
announced a net loss of FFr65m for the first six months of the year, an
improvement on losses of FFr87m for the same period last year.
The result was achieved on sales 6 per cent lower at FFr7.6bn.
For the current half year, Ugine expects a decline in operating profits
compared with the first six months, but an improvement over the second half
of 1992.
It said this outlook did not take account of the proceeds of the partial
sale of the US unit. For 1992 as a whole, Ugine reported a net loss of
FFr365m.
The sale of shares in North America is to be managed by Merrill Lynch,
Credit Lyonnais Securities and J. P Morgan. An estimated 30 per cent of the
shares will be offered to investors elsewhere.

FT  29 SEP 93 / International Company News: Arbed loss deepens steel sector
gloom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LUXEMBOURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ARBED, the Luxembourg-based steelmaker, yesterday underlined the depth of
the crisis facing the European Community steel industry when it announced a
LFr3.03bn (Dollars 86.6m) net loss for the first half of 1993. In the same
period of 1992, the company recorded a net profit of LFr364m.
The Arbed group is Europe's sixth-largest steelmaker, with an annual
production capacity of 8m tonnes.
Mr Joseph Kinsch, the group's chief executive, warned that if the EC failed
to clamp down on state aid to publicly-owned steel producers the Community
steel strategy would be called into question. Private steelmakers believe
subsidies are distorting the European market and making their job more
difficult.
Mr Kinsch said Arbed would probably lose about LFr5.5bn in the full year,
slightly less than Arbed's worst expectations at the beginning of this year.
Mr Kinsch said the group was still unlikely to pay a dividend for 1993.
His warning on subsidies came only five days after Mr Jean Gandois, chairman
of Cockerill Sambre, the Belgian steelmaker, revealed a BFr3bn loss for the
first half, compared with a BFr1.3bn profit in the equivalent period. Mr
Gandois warned that shareholders should not expect a dividend for 1993, and
forecast that the Belgian group would lose between BFr4bn and BFr6bn in the
full year.
The EC's private steelmakers were set a deadline of tomorrow to submit plans
for voluntary cuts in capacity, as part of an overall European Commission
strategy to alleviate the pressure of overcapacity, recession and low
prices. But an EC-wide restructuring plan cannot be agreed until the
sensitive state-aid question has been resolved. Industry ministers met last
week in Brussels to discuss the problem, but are unlikely to vote on subsidy
proposals before their next scheduled meeting in November.
'It's inadmissible in this situation that others, like Spain, Italy and
certain regions of Germany, continue to subsidise steelmaking,' Mr Kinsch
said yesterday. 'The rules of the game should be respected by everybody and
it isn't acceptable that subsidies should spare state-owned industry.'
Arbed managed to increase its turnover by 1 per cent in the first half to
LFr98.6bn, although that was partly due to inclusion of the group's east
German subsidiary in the consolidated results, as well as an increase in
stainless steel production.
The Luxembourg group is nine months into a three-year 'crisis plan' which
involves spending LFr12.5bn, in particular on the replacement of traditional
coal-fired blast furnaces with electric furnaces.
A new electric furnace will come on line at one of the group's Luxembourg
plants in December, and the company said yesterday this would have a
decisive impact on the cost of manufacturing long products.

<TEXT>
THE DEPARTURE of Hutchison Telecommunications managing director, Mr Richard
Siemens, has heightened expectations that the Hong Kong conglomerate is to
sell part of its UK telecommunications operations and focus future
investment on Hong Kong and China.
Mr Siemens' resignation followed that of Hutchison Whampoa managing director
Mr Simon Murray, who was the fellow architect of the group's billion dollar
expansion into mobile telecommunications in Britain. The group is developing
PCN and CT2 networks in the UK.
This expansion is now being curtailed. Mr Li Ka-shing, chairman, and Canning
Fok, Mr Murray's successor, have both expressed concern over the amount of
capital required, and the long-term nature of the investment.
Mr Siemens has been replaced by Khoo Chek-ngee, former vice-president of
mobile communications at Singapore Telecommunication. Mr Chek-ngee's Asian
experience further emphasises Hutchison's strategy of retrenching overseas,
but expanding in China.
Mr Siemens had run the group's telecommunications operations since 1985. The
Hong Kong business contributed an operating profit of around HKDollars 600m
(USDollars 77m) last year. However, this was almost entirely absorbed by
losses from the UK side.
Hutchison Telecommunications UK is 65 per cent owned by Hutchison
Telecommunications. British Aerospace owns a further 30 per cent.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SIR Robert Jones, one of New Zealand's most flamboyant businessmen, has sold
his shares in Tasman Properties, the company he founded in 1982.
Falling property values and rising debt have forced the company gradually to
sell all its property outside Australia and New Zealand. The shares stood at
NZDollars 3.80 in 1987: they are currently around 8 cents.
Sir Robert was deposed as chief executive last year by a group representing
the company's new main institutional shareholder, New York-based Eyk Van
Otterloo. The company subsequently changed its name from Robert Jones
Investments to Tasman Properties.
Earlier this month the High Court lifted a freeze on 40m Tasman shares owned
by Sir Robert. The freeze was imposed last month after the Securities
Commission alleged that Sir Robert had given inadequate information on share
deals.
Whitcoulls has agreed to buy Croxley Collins, the stationery group, for
about NZDollars 50m (USDollars 28m), from the unlisted Spicers Papers.
Croxley has annual sales revenue of around NZDollars 55m and prints Croxley
writing papers, Collins diaries and Olympic school stationery. The
Whitcoulls retail outlets already sell around 75 per cent of Croxley's
products.

ITT, the US conglomerate, is spending Dollars 400m to buy 80 per cent of a
General Motors automotive components company which makes motors and wiper
systems.
The deal marks a substantial expansion of ITT's already large automotive
components business and is part of a strategy by GM to slim down its
Automotive Components Group as it concentrates on restoring its North
American vehicle assembly operations to profit.
GM will retain a 20 per cent interest in the business, which will be managed
and operated by ITT and employ the unit's existing workforce of more than
5,400. GM will continue to buy components and systems from the company under
a long-term supply agreement. It is expected to account initially for 90 per
cent of its sales.
The business, which had sales of Dollars 760m last year and is said to be
profitable, is a leading supplier in North America of motors for windscreen
wipers, power antennae and seats as well as making complete wiper systems.
The acquisition appears a good fit for ITT, which is a leading supplier of
these products in Europe but has no US manufacturing presence in this area.
ITT's automotive parts business has annual revenues of around Dollars 3.5bn.
The GM business also makes air movement components and electro-mechanical
devices, which ITT said was an area of growth opportunity in Europe.
The unit has an engineering and technical centre in Dayton, Ohio and plants
in Rochester, New York, and Nuevo Laredo and Juarez in Mexico.
The sale is consistent with GM's policy announced last December of disposing
of automotive components businesses which were uncompetitive or required too
much capital.
Earlier this month it announced plans to sell five parts-making plants,
employing 6,800 workers, to American Axle &amp; Manufacturing, a company formed
to buy the assets.
The disposals come as GM and the United Auto Workers union are preparing for
talks over a new labour contract focusing on job security. The UAW is wary
of GM plant sales, though it will continue representing workers at American
Axle and those at the motors unit are represented by the International Union
of Electrical Workers.
Mr Timothy Leuliette, chief executive of ITT's automotive business, said the
deal reinforced ITT's commitment to the global auto industry. It would
'strengthen our position in these strategic product lines and further
balance our sales between Europe and North America'.

FT  29 SEP 93 / International Company News: Kraft in talks on disposal of
Birds Eye

KRAFT General Foods, the US food products company, revealed yesterday it was
considering the sale of its Birds Eye frozen vegetables and fruit business.
The company, part of the Philip Morris group, said it was in negotiations
with several parties over a possible disposal of the operation, which
generated about Dollars 280m in sales in the year to September.
Mr James Kitts, president of Kraft USA, said Birds Eye had 'significant
sales potential'. 'However, we are evaluating various strategic options, and
one of them is to sell the business,' he said.
Kraft declined to identify the companies involved in the discussions, or to
comment on the nature of the alternatives it was also considering.
The move by Kraft to entertain offers for Birds Eye highlights the company's
recent efforts to divest itself of its less-profitable grocery lines to
concentrate on products such as breakfast cereals and refrigerated foods,
which deliver higher operating margins and show more growth potential.
The Birds Eye announcement comes just a month after Kraft agreed to sell its
entire frozen dessert business to Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch consumer
products group, for an estimated Dollars 300m. The business, which included
such well-known ice cream brands as Breyers and Sealtest, had about Dollars
500m in sales last year.
The Birds Eye business has about a 15 per cent share of the Dollars 1.9bn US
frozen vegetable and fruit market, according to Nielsen Market Research.

FT  29 SEP 93 / International Company News: GM misses production target
</HEADLINE>

GENERAL Motors, which has been involved in a shake-up of its supplier
network over the past 18 months, said yesterday that its third-quarter US
production would be 70,000 vehicles below earlier estimates because of
problems fitting new parts into its models, writes Martin Dickson.
The company estimated in July that its production of cars and trucks would
total 845,000 units in the quarter but it said yesterday that it expected to
manufacture 775,000 units.
It said the drop was not due to weaker demand for its vehicles. Analysts
said the shortfall could hit its third-quarter financial results and make it
harder to achieve its goal of breaking even in North America this year on an
operating basis after several years of heavy losses.
The problems seem due in part to the shake-up in GM's relations with parts
suppliers which was set in motion last year by Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de
Arriortua, the executive who quit GM earlier this year to join Volkswagen of
Germany.
The two companies are embroiled in a legal battle over GM's accusations that
Mr Lopez and other defectors of Volkswagen took with them sensitive company
documents.
Mr Lopez, in an attempt to slash GM's parts purchasing costs, forced many
suppliers to renegotiate contracts at short notice.
Suppliers warned that this could have a knock-on effect on GM production in
the model year just started.
GM said yesterday that the problems could not be attributed to the
cost-cutting process, 'which is sound and is working'.
However, GM acknowledged that its vehicles would contain 20,000 new parts
this year, significantly higher than previous years.

FT  29 SEP 93 / International Company News: Bell Canada restructure plan
could cut 5,000 jobs

BELL CANADA, the country's biggest telecommunications utility, plans to
reduce 1994 operating expenses and capital spending by about 10 per cent,
and the payroll of 46,000 people could be cut by 5,000 within a year.
Bell is a subsidiary of BCE, Canada's biggest publicly-held company and
provides most of BCE's income.
Bell told employees it was beginning an overall 'restraint' programme,
taking CDollars 466m (USDollars 352m) out of operating expense and cutting
CDollars 300m from the capital budget. The burden will fall on local
services.
Attrition, incentive packages, extended leave of absence, voluntary
part-time work and elimination of overtime 'will remove the equivalent of
5,000 people from our workforce over the next few months,' said Mr Robert
Kearney, president.
Bell said this implied a reduction in the total workforce of up to 5,000
within a year as the programme takes effect but it hopes to avoid lay-offs.
In 1990 it employed 52,000 people.
The programme is Bell's response to a decision by the Canadian
Radio-Television and Telecommunications Commission to reject the company's
request for rate increases.
The CRTC allowed Bell an 11 per cent to 12 per cent annual rate of return
for 1994. But Mr Kearney said even this could not be achieved without the
restraint programme.
'This should bring earnings in 1994 to a level that will counter the
decision by rating agencies to put our debt on creditwatch,' he said.
BCE lost CDollars 346m, or 98 cents a share, on revenues of CDollars 9.9bn
in the first half, after writing off its share of a CDollars 940m special
charge by Northern Telecom. Profit a year earlier was CDollars 496m, or
CDollars 1.76 a share, on revenues of CDollars 9.8bn.

MARRIOTT Corporation, the US lodging and food services group, has received a
favourable ruling from the US Internal Revenue Service that the planned
spin-off of its lodging and services management operations as Marriott
International will be tax-free, Reuter reports from Washington.
The company said the spin-off had been dependent on a favourable IRS ruling,
among other conditions, and should its board at a September 29 meeting find
that all conditions had been met, the distribution of one Marriott
International share for each Marriott Corp share held would be made on
October 8 to holders of record on September 30.
After the spin-off, which is taking the form of a special dividend, Marriott
will change its name to Host Marriott.
The associated exchange offer for its outstanding notes and senior
debentures is scheduled to expire on October 7.

<TEXT>
THE SURVIVAL of the New York Post was once again in question yesterday after
Mr Rupert Murdoch walked away from the brash tabloid following a strike by
journalists.
'Union members have refused to work at the New York Post, forcing management
to cancel its agreement to purchase the newspaper,' said Mr Patrick Purcell,
president and chief executive officer of News America Publishing, part of Mr
Murdoch's News Corporation.
The Newspaper Guild, representing reporters and editors as well as
circulation and advertising staff, went on strike on Monday, and pressmen
and delivery drivers refused to cross picket lines.
Mr Murdoch's company had been expected to finalise its purchase of the
newspaper later this week, with or without a contract agreement with the
Guild. News Corp, which has been operating the paper under a contract with
the bankruptcy court, said it was returning responsibility for the newspaper
to the bankruptcy court. It said it had already spent more than Dollars 10m
since it started running the paper earlier this year.
Although no other buyer has stepped forward with a bid for the 192-year-old
paper, the mood on the picket line was cautiously optimistic. Mr Jim Nolan,
a reporter and Guild official said: 'This paper has come back from the dead
more times than Frankenstein.'
Post employees are hoping that Mr Murdoch's move is a bargaining ploy
instead of a death sentence.
A spokeswoman for New York Governor Mr Mario Cuomo, who has taken an active
interest in the paper's survival and helped assemble investors in the past,
said Mr Cuomo 'will do anything he can to help the paper. He's been in
contact with the paper's unions and management representitives'. Mr Cuomo,
who also spoke to Mr Murdoch yesterday, said Mr Murdoch's position had not
changed.
Mr Murdoch stepped back into the picture in March, when he offered to rescue
the paper, which had changed owners several times and was operating under
bankruptcy court protection.
This is the second time in less than three months that Mr Murdoch has closed
the paper. In July, The Post failed to publish for several days while he was
negotiating with its unions. He reached agreements with ten of the 11 unions
and members of the Guild agreed to return to work while continuing
discussions with News Corp. The dispute centres on severance terms and a
company demand to have the right to fire any employee, regardless of
seniority, within four months of Murdoch's takeover.

CREDIT Lyonnais, the French bank which owns Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, said that
it had no immediate plans to sell the Hollywood film studio following an
announcement by Mr William Koch that he plans to make an offer for the
company, writes Karen Zagor in New York.
Mr Koch, winner of the 1992 Americas Cup yacht race, is chairman and biggest
shareholder of Kendall Square Research, a supercomputer company.
He said he had retained International Creative Management (ICM), the
Hollywood talent agency, and its chairman to advise him.
Credit Lyonnais took control of MGM last year after foreclosing on loans it
made to Mr Giancarlo Parretti, an Italian entrepreneur who bought the
company in 1990 from Mr Kirk Kerkorian for Dollars 1.3bn. Credit Lyonnais is
involved in litigation with Mr Kerkorian.
Under US banking law Credit Lyonnais must sell the studio by 1997.

improvement

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CHARLES SCHWAB, the largest discount brokerage company in the US, said it
expected to post a sharp increase in third-quarter profits to between
Dollars 18m and Dollars 21m when it releases its latest three-monthly
earnings next month. In the same quarter a year ago, it earned just Dollars
7.8m, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
The third quarter of 1992 was an unusually weak period for the firm.
Its latest earnings, while up sharply from a year ago, will still be below
the first and second quarters of this year, when the broker reported net
income of Dollars 35.4m and Dollars 31.6m, respectively.
This steady, if modest, decline in Schwab's earnings during 1993 suggests
that, while stock markets have been reaching record highs and investor
interest in equities has been booming, the overall level of trading activity
may have peaked.
Results for the full year, however, will still come in considerably higher
than the Dollars 81.2m earned in 1992, which was itself a record.

   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MANNESMANN, the diversified German engineering group, announced a rights
issue which it said would help it fight recession and continue
diversification, Reuter reports from Bonn.
The group said it would raise its capital by DM201.9m (Dollars 122.5m) to
DM1.8bn through a one-for-eight rights issue in mid-October.
The new shares, the price of which will be set near the issue date, will be
entitled to half a dividend on results from the current business year, to
December 31.
'The capital increase will serve to ensure growth and structural change,'
Mannesmann said. 'Restructuring measures to improve profitability introduced
in all areas of the company will still burden earnings in 1993 but will
considerably lower the break-even threshold and show a clear improvement of
profits in 1994,' it added.
The company posted a net loss of DM467m in the first six months of the
current year.
Mannesmann also sought to allay fears that it would not pay a dividend on
results from its current business year.
'The capital increase also underlines the intention of the management board
to do justice to the interests of shareholders with an adequate rate of
return on their invested capital,' it said. The group paid a dividend of DM6
a share in 1992.
While giving no indication that its core businesses were close to returning
to profit, Mannesmann said its mobile telephone division, Mannesmann
Mobilfunk, would make a profit sooner than expected.

FT  29 SEP 93 / International Company News: Fiat unveils L5,000bn
cash-raising package
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN

<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FIAT, Italy's biggest private company, yesterday launched a large
cash-raising plan combining a rights issue and the sale of its Rinascente
retailing subsidiary.
The complex package also contained the surprise that Mr Giovanni Agnelli,
chairman, and Mr Cesare Romiti, managing director, will stay on two years
longer than expected, to mid-1996.
The group plunged into a L966bn (Dollars 612.6m) loss in the first half
against pre-tax profit of L655bn last time, reflecting the severe downturn
in the core car business and continuing difficulties at some of its other
industrial activities.
First-half sales fell 2.5 per cent to L29,393bn, principally due to a 11.7
per cent fall in sales of cars and a drop of almost 16 per cent in trucks.
Fiat forecast that full-year earnings, before extraordinary items such as
asset sales, would remain in the red because of the sharp fall in demand.
Reflecting the cost of its investment programme, the group's net financial
position rose to a deficit of L6,983bn from L3,849bn at the end of December.
The cash-raising plans were immediately seen by analysts as a defensive
move, and a step back from hopes to renew management, which has been largely
discredited by Italy's political corruption scandal.
Fiat will meet the heavy costs of its ambitious investment and model renewel
programme with a L5,000bn cash- raising package. About L3,235bn will come
through a two-for-three rights issue of new ordinary, preference and savings
shares, priced at L2,000. A further L194bn will come from new savings shares
for Fiat employees.
Warrants, linked to the new shares and exercisable by the end of next year,
will provide an additional L857bn by offering shareholders new ordinary
shares at L1,000 each.
Fiat will raise a further L615bn from Alcatel Alsthom, the French industrial
group which bought its Telettra telecommunications subsidiary in 1991.
Alcatel Alsthom will buy 18m Fiat shares at L7,000 each, and take up rights
to new stock, raising its stake in the group to 2.2 per cent from 1.
The French group will enter a 'hard core' of Fiat shareholders, which will
form a shareholders' pact to control 30 per cent of the group. The pact,
comprising Ifi and Ifil, two listed investment companies dominated by Fiat's
controlling Agnelli family, will also have Deutsche Bank and Mediobanca
among its members.
Separately, Generali, Italy's biggest insurance group, will buy 35m Fiat
shares and take part in the rights issue, giving it a 2.4 per cent stake. In
return, Fiat will spend about L160bn buying a 40 per cent stake in
Generali's Paris-based Europ Assistance insurance services subsidiary.
The Rinascente sale involves an offer to Fiat shareholders of the group's 58
per cent holding in the retailer's ordinary shares. Fiat share holders will
be offered four Rinascente shares for every 100 of Fiat's.

FT  29 SEP 93 / International Company News: Marzotto slides to L5.2bn
shortfall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MARZOTTO, one of Italy's biggest textiles and clothing groups, reported a
first-half loss of L5.2bn (Dollars 3.3m) after tax and minority interests
against a profit of L9.3bn last year.
The group, which controls Hugo Boss of Germany, said its results were
severely affected by the recession and the impact of tighter margins and
lower demand, especially in the highly-competitive Italian clothing sector.
However, it forecast a cut in net borrowings and a return to profit in the
second half.
Group sales, adjusted for disposals, rose 1.7 per cent to L959.5bn. By the
end of August, turnover was virtually unchanged at L1,288bn compared with
the previous year.
Although Marzotto's first-half turnover in Italy slumped 13.9 per cent, the
lower value of the lira inflated the group's foreign sales, notably from
Hugo Boss.
This meant that foreign turnover rose 13.3 per cent. Foreign sales accounted
for 60.8 per cent of turnover in the first half, compared with 54.1 per cent
at the same time last year.
Danieli, the heavy industrial group best known for its steel mini-mills,
reported a sharp fall in group net profits for the 1992-93 financial year,
ending June 30.
Net earnings declined to L28bn from L45bn, while group sales fell to L650bn
from L760bn in 1991-92.
For the second year running the group is cutting its dividend, with a
L30-a-share reduction to L150 for ordinary shares and L170 for non-voting
savings stock.

FT  29 SEP 93 / International Company News: MoDo warns of second-half
deficit
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MODO, a leading Swedish forestry group, said yesterday it would make a loss
in the second half of this year. However, it would not exceed the SKr353m
(Dollars 44m) deficit it posted in the first half.
MoDo, which will launch a SKr1.7bn rights issue this week, said last month
it believed the long-running recession in the European pulp and paper
markets had touched bottom. It then announced plans for a one-for-two issue
to help it take advantage of an upturn.
A full-year loss of SKr700m or less would represent a sharp improvement over
last year, when MoDo reported a SKr1.7bn shortfall. In the first half this
year, operating profits leapt to SKr346m from SKr59m in the 1992 period.
However MoDo warned its estimate for the second half was based on 'several
uncertain economic and sectoral factors' outside its control. It is anxious
that the Swedish krona remains at its present low levels, having benefited
from the 25 per cent fall in its value since last year. It is also depending
on no further fall in prices for its main products.
The company will publish its prospectus for the new issue tomorrow. The
issue, for existing holders of ordinary shares and convertible participating
notes, will be priced at SKr120 per share, compared with a current price on
the Stockholm stock exchange of around SKr210 for its most-traded B shares.

FT  29 SEP 93 / International Company News: Matsushita lowers profit
forecast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MATSUSHITA, the world's largest electronics company, yesterday lowered its
profits forecast and said it expected to see a third year of falling
earnings. It blamed depressed demand in Japan and the unexpected
appreciation of the yen.
It said pre-tax profits for the parent company would be 35 per cent down at
Y63bn (Dollars 595.4m), rather than 3 per cent up at Y100bn, as forecast
earlier in the year.
The company is expecting a 4 per cent decline in sales, to Y4,350bn,
compared with a forecast 1 per cent increase, to Y4,600bn.
Mr Yuji Hijikata, a director of Matsushita, said the revision was necessary
due to a worse-than-expected trading environment in the first half to
September. During this time, the company expects sales to have been Y70bn
less than forecast.
This was blamed largely on a sharp downturn in sales of products that
normally enjoy strong demand in summer - such as air conditioners - after an
unusually cool summer in Japan. The decline in these products accounted for
70 per cent of the drop in first-half sales, Mr Hijikata said.
Overseas sales, on the other hand, rose 3 per cent in local currency terms,
largely due to the strength of demand in Asian countries. However, the yen's
strength against almost all main currencies has dragged overseas sales down
10 per cent to Y3,130bn.
Consolidated pre-tax profits for the year to March, 1994, are consequently
expected to be 11 per cent down on the previous year, at Y150bn, rather than
25 per cent up, at Y210bn, as forecast earlier.
Sales are forecast at Y6,550bn, which represents a 7 per cent decline from a
year ago, compared with a previous forecast of flat sales of Y7,060bn.
Matsushita does not expect to see a strong recovery in consumer demand in
the near term. It is also uncertain of the impact of currency fluctuations
in the second half.
The company is hoping to deal with the difficult situation by further
rationalisations and cost cuts. It expects to achieve cost reductions of
Y14bn this year, and will reduce capital expenditure by about Y10bn to just
over Y60bn.
However, it has no plans to follow the lead of a growing number of Japanese
companies to have introduced voluntary retirement schemes. Nor does it plan
to close any facilities temporarily, or reduce the number of new recruits
next year.

VONTOBEL Holding, the Zurich-based private banking group, has taken an
agreed one-third stake in Tardy, de Watteville &amp; Cie, a small Geneva private
bank. It plans to raise its share to two-thirds within two years. The price
paid - in cash and shares - was not disclosed.
The move represents a first step along the path mapped out last May by Mr
Hans-Dieter Vontobel, chairman of Vontobel Holding, to ensure an independent
future for the family-controlled group.
The three existing partners of Tardy, de Watteville will continue to run the
Geneva bank, which employs 55 people and had a balance sheet of SFr94m
(Dollars 64.9m) at the end of July. One partner, Mr Bernard de Watteville,
is to be proposed to the Vontobel board.

FT  29 SEP 93 / International Company News: Minorco claims a future in
mining - The Anglo deal gives scope for specialisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT MAY be fortuitous that Anglo American chose to announce a reorganisation
of its international assets only four days after Nelson Mandela called for a
final lifting of economic sanctions. It is certainly not inappropriate.
It would be difficult to name a company which has suffered more during the
sanctions years because of its South Africa ties than Minorco, the offshore
natural resources associate of Anglo American, the country's largest
company.
Five years ago this month, Minorco's Pounds 3bn (Dollars 4.5m) bid for
Consolidated Gold Fields foundered amid massive negative publicity on
anti-South Africa feeling. The bid was supposed to be the first part in a
strategy that would convert Minorco from a sleepy investment holding company
into one of the world's largest natural resource groups - a dynamic,
'hands-on' operator of its assets.
Things did not work out that way. The abortive Consgold bid served only to
highlight Minorco's parentage - a considerable liability at the height of
the sanctions era - and considerably hamper efforts toward its main
strategic aim. Minorco was subsequently forced to spend much of its time
trying to deny its roots.
Yesterday's announcement of a Dollars 1.43bn asset swap - in which Anglo
will transfer the bulk of its offshore assets to Minorco, which, in
exchange, will issue 55m shares and transfer its African assets to Anglo -
makes clear that all this has changed. Minorco is claiming to have
transformed itself from a holding company into an operating company in
natural resources.
Upon completion of the transaction, Anglo's shareholding in Minorco will
increase to 43.1 per cent from 39.3 per cent. Anglo's associate, De Beers
Centenary, will, meanwhile, increase its shareholding to 22.6 per cent from
21.1 per cent. Also, three more Anglo directors will go on to the Minorco
board, and three Minorco directors will come on to Anglo's.
Commenting on the improved political climate, Anglo said: 'South African
companies can now be seen to be involved internationally and not deny their
roots.'
Mr Julian Ogilvie Thompson, chairman of Anglo and Minorco, said the deal
flowed from Anglo's re-entry into the world community. He said the previous
structure of some of Anglo's offshore holdings 'had been imposed on us by
South Africa's pariah status', and it was now possible to rationalise these.
He said it was also necessary to avoid the possibility of competition
developing between Anglo and Minorco.
Anglo refutes suggestions the deal might involve the shifting of assets
offshore, away from the reaches of a potentially interventionist government.
It notes the deal merely involves a rearrangement of assets that were,
anyway, outside of South Africa.
Indeed, in the current climate of strict exchange controls for the movement
of capital offshore, the Reserve Bank (central bank) would almost certainly
have denied approval if it had thought the balance of payments might suffer.
The deal was welcomed by analysts as a logical development benefiting both
companies. As Mr Ogilvie Thompson noted: 'It will increase substantially
Minorco's proportion of operating assets by bringing together fragmented
international holdings under Minorco's ownership, while African holdings
will be brought together under Anglo's and Centenary's ownership.'
One effect of the deal is that Anglo has effectively nailed its colours to
the mast as a predominantly African group. It believes the political
rapprochement between South Africa and its neighbours will bring a number of
business opportunities better handled from Johannesburg than Luxembourg
(where Minorco is registered) or London (where it is based).
Anglo, of course, will retain a large spread of offshore interests through
its interests in De Beers and Minorco. Mr Ogilvie Thompson says the group
hasn't excluded the possibility of offshore deals.
The restructuring comes against the background of a similar 'tidying-up'
exercise within South Africa, where Anglo has sought to rationalise its
industrial investments into Amic, its industrial arm.
Mr Ogilvie Thompson said yesterday that while Anglo had set itself against
unbundling - as Gencor and Barlows, two other South African companies, have
done - it had always been prepared to rationalise activities with the aim of
making them more focused and transparent.
Copper is very much at the heart of the deal. Anglo now takes control of
Minorco's 49.9 per cent stake in Zambia Copper Investments (ZCI), whose sole
investment is a 27.3 per cent stake in the ZCCM, the state-run Zambian
copper company up for privatisation.
Anglo is favoured to re-enter the Zambian copper scene, where its interests
were nationalised over 20 years ago. Minorco, meanwhile, takes
responsibility for the potentially large copper investments of Anglo
American South America (AMSA).
Anglo recently announced plans for AMSA in Chile and Peru which, taken
together with likely involvement in Zambia, could see the group becoming the
world's largest copper producer.

FT  29 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Hamlet will have near Pounds 40m valuation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HAMLET GROUP, the clothes importer supplying the UK retail trade, will have
a market capitalisation of Pounds 38.8m after its flotation next month.
The pathfinder prospectus, published yesterday, shows that a total of 15.4m
ordinary shares are to be placed at 130p per share.
The historic p/e ratio at the issue price is 11.5 and the gross yield 5.5
per cent on a notional net dividend of 5.8p for the year to March, 1993.
After the float, there will be 29.8m shares in issue.
Hamlet began life as a family concern in the late 1960s. Last year a buy-out
left management and Causeway Capital with 80 per cent and Southend Property
with 20 per cent.
The company is raising Pounds 14.4m via its placing and intermediaries
offer, which closes next Wednesday.
This will enable it to redeem its preference shares for Pounds 6.92m and
give it Pounds 6.9m of additional working capital.
Further, existing shareholders are selling 4.29m shares valued at Pounds
5.58m. Beeson Gregory, the sponsor, said that directors who were selling
were disposing of less than half their stakes.
After the flotation, existing shareholders will retain 14.46m ordinary
shares, or 48.4 per cent of the enlarged capital. Causeway is redeeming its
preference shares, but holding on to 22 per cent of the group's ordinary
shares. Hamlet reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 4.2m (Pounds 3.1m) on
turnover of Pounds 58.9m (Pounds 32.8m) in the year to March.

FT  29 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Boosey &amp; Hawkes little changed at Pounds
1.41m - Tough conditions in mainland Europe and Japan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOOSEY &amp; HAWKES, the instrument maker and music publisher, reported a small
decline in pre-tax profits from Pounds 1.44m to Pounds 1.41m for the first
half of 1993.
Mr Richard Holland, chief executive, said the group had been glad to
maintain profits in view of tough conditions in mainland Europe, and
particularly in Japan.
He expected the group to maintain its position for the rest of this year and
then to resume slow growth.
Sales of instruments to Japan, mainly woodwind, were down 15 per cent by
volume and 10 per cent by value in the half, while sales in Europe remained
flat.
However, the instruments division, which last year accounted for just over a
third of operating profits, was benefiting from production efficiencies
after action taken last year, including the movement of woodwind production
from the Frankfurt area to eastern Germany.
Total turnover increased from Pounds 26.5m to Pounds 29.4m. The rise
reflected sterling's devaluation, Mr Holland said, adding that in real terms
turnover had been flat.
The publishing division was making steady progress, Mr Holland said, with
significant strength in the US. He expected royalties from the best-selling
third symphony by the Polish composer Gorecki to start arriving in the
second half.
The group was also delighted that the EC looks set to adopt a copyright term
of 70 years from July 1995. This would give an enhanced income stream in
future years. By the end of this year Rakhmaninov's music will not be
covered under the UK's present 50-year copyright rule, and Bartok's comes
out of copyright in 1995.
Net borrowings were Pounds 21m, giving gearing of 98 per cent at the end of
the half, compared with Pounds 14.2m at the end of the year when gearing was
70 per cent.
Mr Holland said that because of the nature of its business the group was
'not unhappy with gearing at this level'. About 75 per cent of its
instrument sales are made in the second half.
Earnings per share were 18.5p (18.6p) and an unchanged interim dividend of
6p is proposed.

FT  29 SEP 93 / International Company News: Kerry raises Dollars 155m to cut
US debt

<TEXT>
KERRY GROUP, the international dairy products and foods company based in
Ireland, has raised Dollars 155m (Pounds 101m) in its first private placing
of senior loan notes with US investors, with a view to reducing debt charges
in its US operations.
The placement is split into two nearly equal tranches with maturities of
seven and 10 years, and carries a fixed, but undisclosed, interest rate.
The company's approach to US capital markets aimed to take advantage of both
attractive rates and what it described as keen investor appetites for
investment-grade corporate issues.
The funds will facilitate a total restructuring of Kerry's current
indebtedness in the US.
A small portion will remain to finance further acquisitions, but total group
debt at the year-end will not be significantly greater than the IPounds 109m
(Pounds 104m) at the end of 1992.
The company has also acquired Research Foods, a subsidiary of F&amp;C
International of the US, for CDollars 10m (Pounds 5m). This is the second
acquisition of a food ingredients company in Canada by Kerry this year, the
first being Malcolm Foods last March.
The combined turnover of the two subsidiaries will be approximately CDollars
30m, and will give Kerry a 50 per cent share of the specialist snack food
ingredients business in Canada.
The company is also looking at several acquisition options in Mexico as the
development of the Nafta agreement gives opportunities for expansion in both
Mexico and South America.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Allied London Properties, the property investor and developer, lifted
pre-tax profits from Pounds 1.49m to Pounds 6.8m in the year to June 30.
Net rental income rose from Pounds 17.1m to Pounds 18.7m. Trading profits
amounted to Pounds 438,000 (Pounds 562,000) and other income totalled Pounds
1.88m (Pounds 1.39m). An exceptional debit of Pounds 3.5m last time
reflected a reduction in the value of the group's housebuilding assets.
An unchanged final dividend of 2.455p is recommended to maintain the total
at 3.53p. Earnings per share worked through at 5p against losses of 1.5p.
Net asset value per share stood at 85p at June 30 against 90p a year
earlier. Fully diluted, the figure was 95p (100p). At the year end the
property portfolio was valued at Pounds 180m.

<TEXT>
DBS Management, the financial services group, turned in a pre-tax loss of
Pounds 518,000 for the year to March 31, against a Pounds 1.46m profit last
time.
The figure was struck from increased operating profits of Pounds 2m (Pounds
1.71m) and after exceptionals of Pounds 2.52m (Pounds 250,000).
Turnover was ahead at Pounds 37.6m (Pounds 25.6m).
Losses per share were 19.5p against earnings of 40.3p last time, but the
dividend is maintained at 8p.
DBS was fined Pounds 60,000 by Fimbra in June over its home income plans.
Its shares are traded on a matched bargain basis under Rule 535(2).

FT  29 SEP 93 / UK Company News: William Jacks shows improvement
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A significant reduction in interest charges, partly offset by restructuring
costs, enabled William Jacks to report pre-tax profits up from Pounds 1,000
to Pounds 65,000 in the six months to July 31.
Turnover of the motor dealer - the ultimate owner of which is Johan
Holdings, a Malaysian incorporated company - rose from Pounds 21.2m to
Pounds 22.6m.
Interest payable fell from Pounds 442,000 to Pounds 284,000, but exceptional
items totalled Pounds 90,000 (nil), comprising Pounds 64,000 of redundancy
costs and Pounds 26,000 of closure costs at Caxton.
Losses per share were reduced to 0.22p (0.96p).

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
UK Safety reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 302,000 for the first half of
1993.
The protective footwear manufacturer came to the market in May through the
reverse takeover of TSW, the former independent television contractor for
the south-west of England.
The result, relating to May and June, was achieved on turnover of Pounds
5.02m and after TSW closure costs of Pounds 460,000. The comparable figure
was a loss of Pounds 3.6m, restated for FRS 3, after closure costs of Pounds
5.06m, on turnover of Pounds 18.8m.
Earnings per share were 1.96p (losses of 16.5p). The interim dividend is
1.04p (2p).
Pro-forma results, prepared to show the performance of the continuing
business, showed pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.25m (Pounds 533,000) resulting
from lower interest charges. Operating profit, however, was down at Pounds
1.66m (Pounds 1.47m) on lower turnover of Pounds 14.8m (Pounds 16.3m).

FT  29 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Cathay makes Pounds 28m placing to fund
Beijing development
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CATHAY International, a China-based property developer formerly known as
Stonehill Holdings, yesterday announced a Pounds 28.4m placing to fund
developments in Beijing and Shenzhen.
The company is spending Pounds 19.6m to buy a 60 per cent stake in a joint
venture to upgrade a hotel and build office, retail and residential space on
a 500,000 sq m site in the Haidian district of Beijing.
The Beijing Xiyuan Hotel, owned by the Beijing municipal government, will
have a 35 per cent interest in the joint venture, in return for supplying
the site.
Beijing Jin Peng Property Development, a financial arm of the Beijing
municipal government, has agreed to subscribe about Pounds 1.6m in cash for
a 5 per cent stake in the company.
Mr James Buchanan, chairman of Cathay International, said the deal was 'a
rare opportunity' to obtain an interest in land use and development rights
over a large site in central Beijing.
He said its attractions were enhanced by the growth in the number of
visitors to Beijing, the rapid increase in direct foreign investment there
and the economic potential of the area.
The project, expected to be completed in 1999, will begin with the
construction of two office towers providing 70,500 sq m of floor space.
The Xiyuan Hotel and site have been valued at Pounds 53m and Pounds 171m
respectively, after taking account of its development potential.
The rest of the proceeds, some Pounds 8.8m, will be used to help fund
Cathay's existing development, the Fuyuan Landmark Hotel in Shenzhen.
The placing and open offer involves 48.8m shares at 62 1/2 p per share. The
open offer is on a 4-for-19 basis.

FT  29 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Overseas sales lift Watts Blake
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STRONG OVERSEAS sales and currency benefits helped Watts Blake Bearne lift
interim pre-tax profits from Pounds 3.74m to Pounds 4.26m, leaving the
world's largest supplier of ball clay on track for meeting its forecast of
Pounds 8.6m before the costs of fending off an unsuccessful takeover bid.
Profits for the six months to June 30 were struck after a charge of Pounds
475,000, about half the cost of defending the bid by Sibelco, a
privately-owned Belgian-based company.
The balance of costs will be booked in the second half.
Sibelco, which has boardroom representation, holds 46.8 per cent of WBB
after it bought out its two partners in a 45.2 per cent concert party and
gained 1.6 per cent during the mandatory bid which lapsed in September.
Under Takeover Panel rules, Sibelco may now buy 1 per cent of WBB's equity
every 12 months: 'Discussions with Sibelco continue but have not reached a
conclusion,' said Mr John Pike, the managing director.
'We are quietly confident of meeting the forecast we made during the bid,'
he said.
The company, which serves the sanitaryware and tile industries, had been
helped in the first half by an Pounds 550,000 increase in operating profits
from overseas operations and a currency benefit this time of Pounds 250,000.
The company was 'seeing the faintest signs of an upturn in the UK and are
looking forward to a recovery in the housing market which is traditionally
important to us'.
Traditionally strong first half cash flow reduced net debt from Pounds 10.9m
at the year end to Pounds 7.44m and interest charges fell to Pounds 432,000
(Pounds 457,000).
Gearing fell to 10 per cent (20 per cent) helped by a Pounds 16m addition to
assets, reflecting a surplus on the book value of mineral reserves which
were revalued at the end of last year.
The board declared an interim dividend of 3.5p (2.7p) and said it would pay
the 12p total forecast at the time of the bid.
Earnings per share rose to 12.6p (12p).
COMMENT
With 25 per cent of its sales outside Europe, WBB has some protection from
the difficult European market. Orders to the Far East continue strong and
the Far Eastern joint ventures and US operations are profitable. The company
should comfortably meet its full-year forecast, giving earnings of 26.5p and
a rating of 16 times. This looks somewhat undervalued for a company which
has generally traded at a premium because of the quality of its clay
deposits and its management.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Thorn EMI yesterday issued a statement through the Stock Exchange accusing
the Wall Street Journal of publishing a 'seriously misleading' article about
the group's US rental business.
The article, which appeared last week, alleged that staff at Thorn's
Rent-a-Center subsidiary employed strong-arm tactics in dealing with
customers whose payments were late.
Thorn said: 'The article relied heavily on anecdotes from former employees,
a number of whom were dismissed for serious breach of company regulations;
all these anecdotes are being investigated.
'It also appears that the views of current management and employees were
either discounted or misrepresented in the article.'
Thorn said Rent-A-Center's goal was continuously to improve relations with
customers.

FT  29 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Baltic back in black with Pounds 1.6m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BALTIC, the finance and leasing company, returned to the black in the six
months to end-June.
On turnover reduced by disposals to Pounds 9.3m, against Pounds 19.5m,
pre-tax profits were Pounds 1.58m, compared with losses of Pounds 2.73m.
The shares rose 8p to 101p.
The company said the improvement was mainly due to the lack of exceptional
items, particularly bad debts of Pounds 5.5m. It added that after charging
Pounds 1.6m for bad debts and interest rate hedges operating profits this
time were down 43 per cent.
During the period the company continued to focus on the reduction of debts
and the development of fee earning capabilities. The book value of the
lending portfolio was halved to Pounds 45m.
Earnings per share came out at 1.2p (losses 6.5p) and the interim dividend
is unchanged at 0.5p.

FT  29 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Smaller Companies Trust calls for Pounds
24m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM DELLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SMALLER Companies Investment Trust is proposing its second substantial
fund raising exercise in five months.
The trust, managed by Abtrust Fund Managers, is attempting to raise some
Pounds 23.8m, net of expenses, through a conditional plac-ing of C shares at
135p apiece.
The previous fund raising, in May, raised approximately Pounds 20.6m net.
Directors said those proceeds had largely been invested.
Shareholders will be able to participate in the latest proposed increase in
the capital base through a right to subscribe for eight C shares for every
17 ordinary and/or warrants held.
The C shares will be converted into ordinary shares at a ratio of their
respective net asset values. Holders will also get new warrants on a 1-for-5
basis, exercisable at 135p in the years 1996-99. Conversion takes place when
90 per cent of the net proceeds have been invested or committed to
investment, or if earlier, on December 31 1993.

FT  29 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Dorling Kindersley jumps 29% - Adult list
leads all-round advance with 31% rise in turnover
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DORLING Kindersley Holdings, the publisher, reported full year pre-tax
profits ahead 29 per cent in its first set of annual results since its
flotation last October.
In the 12 months to June 30 profits were Pounds 9.65m (Pounds 7.5m) on
turnover up 23 per cent to Pounds 87.4m (Pounds 70.9m).
Fully diluted earnings per share were 9.9p (9.4p). A final dividend of 2.2p
is proposed making a total of 3.3p, against a notional 3p.
The profit was struck after a non-recurring Pounds 208,000 charge for
flotation costs and reflected the strong performance of most of the
businesses. Operating profits improved 17 per cent to Pounds 9.08m (Pounds
7.77m).
Mr Peter Kindersley, chairman and chief executive, said: 'It is pleasing to
report a sixth successive year of substantial profit growth. DK Adult's
success in increasing turnover by almost 31 per cent to Pounds 50.5m and DK
Children's resilient second half performance are especially creditable.'
Overall, the group printed about 30m books during the year, an 18 per cent
increase. Among the adult books, particularly successful titles included the
two Royal Horticultural Society gardening books while, from the children's
list, Stephen Biesty's Incredible Cross-Sections sold 650,000 copies.
Backlist turnover increased by 46 per cent to Pounds 31.4m, equivalent to 36
per cent of total turnover, up from 30 per cent in 1992. US turnover from
publishing under the DK imprint, which began two years ago, grew to Pounds
13.7m (Pounds 5.2m).
After concerns at the interim stage about trading conditions in the DK
Children's division, it had a resilient second half, but this was not quite
enough to claw back the first half shortfall and turnover slipped to Pounds
26.6m (Pounds 27.8m) reflecting difficult trading conditions in its main
markets.
New businesses, including DK Multimedia, boosted turnover from Pounds
400,000 to Pounds 4.4m.
COMMENT
Dorling Kindersley's results were in line with market expectations and
underline the depth and quality of the group's established operations,
together with the potential of its new businesses. The group continues to
attract a premium based on its promising CD-Rom multimedia business, but its
core business also has considerable strength as the growing revenues from
the backlist demonstrate. This year the group should produce pre-tax profits
of about Pounds 11.5m and earnings per share of 10.8p. Based on yesterday's
closing share price of 292p, up 3p, the stock is trading on a lofty
prospective p/e of 27, reflecting its glamour-stock status.

FT  29 SEP 93 / UK Company News: First half advance at London and Manchester
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LONDON and Manchester, the life assurance group, increased its interim
dividend by 10 per cent from 4.65p to 5.12p after announcing a 24 per cent
rise in premium income in the first half of 1993.
Mr Tom Pyne, chief executive, said he was optimistic about full-year profits
because the group could distribute to shareholders part of the investment
return on the life fund. In addition, its non-insurance businesses had
benefited from a return to stability in the housing market.
London and Manchester is the only insurer with permission from the
Department of Trade and Industry to distribute part of the long-term
investment return on the shareholders' interest in the roughly Pounds 1.5bn
life fund.
This return will be shown on the profit and loss account with the full-year
results as part of the total annual transfer from the life fund.
In the first half, ordinary life single premiums fell 42 per cent to Pounds
10.4m (Pounds 17.8m). However, total income from single premiums, including
pensions and managed funds, rose by 43 per cent to Pounds 120.7m (Pounds
84.2m). Total annual premium income increased 6 per cent to Pounds 95.3m
(Pounds 89.8m).
The company said its residential mortgage book is 'exhibiting a much
improved performance'. Arrears and repossessions were lower and provisions
had returned to normal levels from last year's higher amount.
The commercial mortgage book has been closed for 18 months. It is now being
run down and the provisions made at the time of closure are considered
adequate.

FT  29 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Bass pubs sale to Mercury Leisure allows
building programme to go ahead
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BASS, the brewery group, is selling 111 pubs to Mercury Leisure, a
privately-owned restaurants and night-club company, for an undisclosed sum.
The disposal of 73 managed and 38 tenanted pubs will enable Bass to proceed
with plans to build 150 new pubs over the coming year without breaching the
Department of Trade and Industry's ceiling of 2,000 outlets, which was
imposed on Britain's leading brewers following an inquiry by the Monopolies
and Mergers Commission.
The transaction will double the size of Mercury Leisure's existing property
portfolio, to be operated in future as Mercury Taverns.
Mr Tony Sanders, joint managing director of the Tamworth-based company, said
the acquisition would be financed through a mixture of new equity, funded by
NatWest Ventures and borrowing from Barclays.
The pubs, which are situated mainly in the Midlands, South Wales and the
north-west of England, will transform Mercury into a 'major new pub group',
according to Mr Sanders.
Although unwilling to reveal the price, Bass said the cash consideration
represented less than 1 per cent of the group's net assets.

FT  29 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Chairman paid Pounds 375,000 after
governance rethink
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR RICHARD PESKIN, chairman of Great Portland Estates, is to receive Pounds
375,000 as a one-off payment for giving up a management arrangement which
fell outside the guidelines of the Cadbury report on corporate governance.
The company yesterday announced that it was ending the long-standing
arrangement by which Great Portland paid management fees to Basil &amp; Howard
Samuel, a company controlled by Mr Peskin. Some institutional shareholders
disliked the deal because it concealed the size of Mr Peskin's pay package.
Mr Roger Payton, deputy chairman, told shareholders that Great Portland's
directors were 'conscious that relationships of this nature, whilst
perfectly valid and proper, are no longer in tune with today's perception of
corporate governance'. Under Mr Peskin's new service contract, he will
receive an annual salary of Pounds 325,000, fixed for two years, in addition
to his fees as chairman of Pounds 25,000.
Mr Peskin's total salary of Pounds 350,000 makes him one of the highest paid
figures in the property industry. Last year, Mr Peter Hunt, chairman of Land
Securities, drew Pounds 266,000; Mr John Ritblat, chairman of British Land,
drew Pounds 336,300; and Mr David Goldstone of Regalian drew Pounds 376,000.
Mr Payton said that the decision to award Mr Peskin the one-off payment
stemmed from an awareness of the necessity to secure his full-time services
for the foreseeable future.
Great Portland is to acquire Basil &amp; Howard Samuel for Pounds 98,987 in
cash, which is equivalent to the value of its assets. Mr Payton told
shareholders that Mr Peskin had been generous in 'putting the interest of
the company ahead of personal gain' by not opting to sell his management
business to a third party and by not requiring compensation for early
termination of the arrangements.
At Great Portland's AGM in July, Mr Peskin said he was 'genuinely
astonished' by criticism of the management agreement. The cost of B&amp;HS's
services, 4 per cent of Great Portland's gross rental income, was 'on a true
comparison the lowest of all the major property groups', he said.

FT  29 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Towry Law to seek listing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TOWRY LAW, one of the UK's largest chains of independent financial advisers,
will today announce plans to place some 35 per cent of its shares with the
public and list them on the Stock Exchange.
The placing, to be underwritten by James Capel, will value the company at
about Pounds 25m.
The shares to be sold are those of the current directors, pension scheme and
Law family interests. The sale will reduce the family's stake from 50 per
cent to 40 per cent.
The flotation comes just as the market for independent financial advice
faces great changes brought on by new regulations and a restructuring of the
insurance industry.
The Treasury has said it will require sales agents from next year to
disclose to prospective clients how much they will earn on each sale and the
value of insurance contracts if they are surrendered early.
Also, the leading insurance providers and IFAs face growing competition from
banks and building societies which are setting up their own insurance
operations and selling to their customers.
Mr Alan Wesley, managing director of Towry Law, said the new regulations
'are all opportunity' which will squeeze the company's smaller competitors
from the market.
While the new regulations may cause insurance companies to either cut
commissions - which form the bulk of Towry Law's revenues - or pay them over
a longer period, the company is sufficiently well capitalised to stand the
strain.
According to research prepared by James Capel, in the five years to June
1993 turnover has grown at a compound rate of 15.4 per cent and pre-tax
profits by 12.7 per cent.

FT  29 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Takare makes Pounds 68m cash call
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TAKARE, the nursing home group, is raising Pounds 68m net of expenses
through a rights issue in order to step up its expansion rate.
The shares fell 8p to 235p, compared with the rights price of 195p.
Takare has been adding beds at the rate of 1,200 to 1,400 a year. Mr Keith
Bradshaw, chairman, said the group was now capable of growing at a faster
rate but refused to say what the new target would be.
Takare accompanied the 2-for-5 issue with a forecast of pre-tax profits of
not less than Pounds 14.8m for 1993, including an exceptional profit of
Pounds 370,000 on the sale of a nursing home, and promised a final dividend
of 1.4p to make a total of 2.1p (1.8p), up 16.7 per cent.
The profits will be after capitalising interest of about Pounds 2.5m,
compared with Pounds 4.16m in 1992.
Mr Bradshaw said the group was continuing to see occupancy levels of 97 per
cent and prices were not under pressure from the new community care system
introduced in April.
Before this rights, Takare had raised Pounds 67.2m through three equity
issues since coming to the market in 1989. It has also raised Pounds 50m
through three tranches of a deben-ture.
Its last equity offer was in September 1991 when the group promised not to
issue more shares for two years.
In recent weeks Takare has attempted to dampen speculation that it would
make a rights issue this month, saying it could continue to expand with debt
finance until the second quarter of 1995 without excessive gearing.
Yesterday, Mr Bradshaw said that while a rights issue was not essential, its
advisers, SG Warburg, had suggested now would be a good time to make one.
He said he would make no promises now about the timing of any further issue.
Takare would have more than 10,000 beds by the end of 1995, he said, and
would reach 'critical mass', meaning it could fund expansion from cashflow,
'well before we are confronted with a gearing problem again'.
The group, which has debt of Pounds 50.8m and cash of Pounds 3.05m, will
have net cash following the issue. Mr Ron Reid, finance director, said that
if the group opened 1,400 beds a year gearing would reach 35 per cent by the
end of 1996. If it opened 2,000 beds a year gearing would reach 55 per cent
by that time.
COMMENT
The timing of Takare's heavy rights at the earliest practicable moment it
was free from its promise not to issue more shares confirms the view that
this is a sector with an insatiable demand for equity capital. Fortunately,
Takare has so far proven its ability to deliver the profits and earnings to
justify its demands. On the profit forecast, the prospective p/e is 17 which
looks reasonable.

FT  29 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Stylo deficit cut to Pounds 1.9m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STYLO, which owns the Barratts chain of shoe shops, announced a 30 per cent
reduction in pre-tax losses to Pounds 1.9m for the six months to July 31.
The company was worried about speculation that the budget would impose VAT
on children's wear, or even increase the tax from 17.5 per cent to 20 per
cent.
'We are deeply concerned about how people will be able to afford that extra
money,' said Mr Michael Ziff, managing director and father of three. Between
15 per cent and 20 per cent of Stylo's sales are children's footwear.
The group reported an 8.5 per cent rise in turnover to Pounds 50.7m,
although improvement had been patchy.
Rationalisation and new product ranges are expected to return Stylo to
profit this year. Analysts are forecasting a pre-tax profit of Pounds 2m
(losses of Pounds 746,000).
A Pounds 2m reduction in stocks to Pounds 23m helped to bring interest down
by Pounds 360,000 to Pounds 2.4m. Debt, at about Pounds 41m, represented 50
per cent of shareholders' funds, against 58 per cent last year.
As in the past the group did not recommend an interim dividend. Losses per
share improved from 13.22p to 9.43p.

FT  29 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Restructuring at Sears begins to bear fruit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SEARS yesterday showed the first fruits of the restructuring begun by Mr
Liam Strong, the new chief executive, with increases in trading profits in
three of its four main divisions.
Although the exceptional items that have been a feature of Sears' results
since Mr Strong took over were still in evidence, once these were removed
trading profits from ongoing businesses increased 26 per cent to Pounds
37.6m.
Much of the increase came from the footwear division - British Shoe
Corporation - which has been the focus of Mr Strong's efforts, and
transformed a Pounds 2.5m loss into a Pounds 9m profit.
BSC increased sales by only 2 per cent overall, to Pounds 253.4m. But as it
closed 88 shops and 54 concessions - the equivalent of 10 per cent of
floorspace, like-for-like sales actually increased by 7 per cent.
At the lower end of the market, the group is now concentrating on rolling
out its successful Shoe Express chain, which will add 25 stores by
Christmas, and 200 by the end of 1994. It also plans to expand the Hush
Puppies chain, which Mr Strong says has 'useful potential' as a mid-market
chain.
Sales in the home shopping division fell 6 per cent to Pounds 249.1m, but
trading profit increased 20 per cent to Pounds 14.9m, reflecting the policy
of enhancing margins and reducing discounting. Costs have also been cut by
reducing the workforce by 300.
However, closure of the loss-making ter Meulen Post, the Dutch mail order
business, resulted in a Pounds 5.5m exceptional charge.
Selfridges, the Oxford Street department store, increased sales by 2 per
cent to Pounds 96.3m, but lifted profits almost 10 per cent to Pounds 6m,
again thanks to improved margins and product mix, and a multi-million pound
revamp of the store.
The high street fashion division was the only one to show a fall in trading
profits, from Pounds 7m to Pounds 4.8m, although sales increased 23 per
cent.
Richards, the womens' wear business acquired from Storehouse last October,
was responsible for much of the increase in sales, and for the fall in
profits.
Mr Strong said Richards had performed badly because it had taken time to
clear old stock, but he was confident the business would make money in the
second half - although he was uncertain whether this would be enough to
offset losses in the first half.
He said the other high street chains, which include Miss Selfridge, Wallis,
and Warehouse, had performed well. Adams, the childrens' wear retailer, had
held profits in a tough market, and Olympus Sports had cut its losses.
Sears is in talks with Sports Authority of the US, part of the K mart group,
on possible co-operation in opening out-of-town sports superstores.

FT  29 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Lloyd Thompson rises 21%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LLOYD THOMPSON, the London market insurance broker, yesterday reported
pre-tax profits up 21 per cent to Pounds 17.4m for the year to June 30.
Brokerage income rose 13 per cent to Pounds 41.1m and other operating income
rose to Pounds 6m, compared with Pounds 5.8m last year. Earnings per share
increased by 20 per cent to 14.8p.
Mr Ken Carter, chief executive, said: 'We're delighted with what we have
achieved. We have maintained our record of 20 per cent growth ever since we
went public in 1987, when conditions have been about as bloody as they could
be.'
He said the performance was due primarily to the increase in brokerage, the
benefits of a stronger dollar, and further cost controls.
About 80 per cent of the company's brokerage fees are generated in dollars,
at an average exchange rate of Dollars 1.64 against Dollars 1.75 last year.
The expense ratio fell from 76 per cent to 72 per cent during the year, and
the average number of employees rose from 339 to 349 during the period.
The directors recommended a total dividend for the year up 20 per cent to
6.7p (5.6p), including a final of 4.7p.
Marine brokerage expanded 7 per cent to Pounds 17.4m, and non-marine by 16
per cent to Pounds 11.8m. Reinsurance brokerage rose 20 per cent to Pounds
12m.
Mr Carter said the company planned to concentrate in the future on energy,
casualty and international insurance business. 'We will also continue our
hair-shirt philosophy with regard to cost control,' he said.
He said Lloyd Thompson had net cash deposits of more than Pounds 30m,
against Pounds 25m last year.

FT  29 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Siebe forms new control systems side in
reshuffle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIEBE, the international controls and engineering group, has announced a
reorganisation which will increase its focus on the high-technology end of
the automated controls market.
The reshuffle follows the success of Siebe's Dollars 650m acquisition in
1990 of Foxboro, the US industrial controls group which has given it a
significant share of the lucrative market for complete automated control
systems, as well as individual components.
Mr Stanley Shaffran, president of Foxboro, is leaving the group to pursue
other interests.
Foxboro will become part of a new division, control systems, to be based in
Massachusetts and run by Mr George Sarney, who recently joined Siebe from
Raytheon, the US defence group. The group's temperature and appliance
controls division, based in Ohio, will be run by Mr James Mueller,
previously president of Ranco, Siebe's temperature control subsidiary. He
succeeds Mr Sarney.
Siebe's third division, diversified products, will be based at Windsor in
the UK and be led by Mr Brian McMahon, previously chief executive of the
group's compressed air businesses. He succeeds Mr John Prohaska.
All three divisional presidents will report to Mr Allen Yurko, Siebe's
managing director and chief operating officer. At the end of the year Mr
Barrie Stephens, Siebe's veteran chairman and chief executive, will hand
over the chief executive's role to Mr Yurko.
Mr Stephens said Mr Yurko should be given most of the credit for the
reorganisation, which would realign the company's structure and particularly
its controls business to mirror the marketplace. About 50 per cent of group
sales are in the US.
He said all three operating divisions would be roughly equal in size, but
emphasised that under this structure Siebe's traditional 'four pillars' -
controls, specialist mechanical engineering, compressed air plus safety and
life support products - remained intact.

FT  29 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Ex-GWR chief plans comeback
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR DANIEL S Pena, the flam-boyant former chairman of Great Western Resources
who departed the company in a cloud of shareholder discontent two years ago,
is planning a comeback to the UK quoted sector following an award by a US
jury of Dollars 3.3m (Pounds 2.14m) plus costs for unfair dismissal.
Mr Pena said the jury's findings in his favour on all 32 counts, which
included absolving him of the obligation to repay Dollars 1.3m in company
loans, had vindicated his actions.
He had argued that he had only agreed to repay the money - expenses incurred
in moving from Los Angeles to Houston - if the company kept him on until his
contract ran out at the end of 1994. 'Would I give Dollars 1.3m back for
free? Am I crazy? Am I an idiot?' asked the outspoken Mr Pena.
Mr Howard Wolf, the chairman who replaced Mr Pena in 1991, said GWR strongly
contested the decision, particularly on the loan repayment. He did not hide
his disappointment at the jury's finding. 'Whatever we pay . . . will reduce
profits,' he said. GWR reported an interim loss of Dollars 2.03m in May,
compared with a Dollars 13.6m loss in the previous year.
Mr Wolf said the jury's award was not final. The judge's verdict would be
made after further presentations from both parties.
Mr Pena, meanwhile, plans to focus on his business seminars run from his
Scottish castle and return to London with a quoted vehicle within the next
12 months.
He also intends to write a book, 'which I expect will be a best-seller,
about how I built up GWR'.

FT  29 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Auditors warning on Isosceles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AUDITORS OF Isosceles, the leveraged parent of the Gateway food retail
group, warned 'there is significant doubt as to the eventual repayment of
the Isosceles debt in full, since any repayments are wholly dependent upon
the future results of Gateway Group'.
The statement came in Ernst &amp; Young's report on the accounts for the year to
April 24, which have been prepared on a 'going concern' basis and took into
account the financial restructuring completed in July. This created net
worth of Pounds 305m for Gateway, Isosceles' subsidiary, compared to
Isosceles' deficit of Pounds 643m at the year end.
Mr Ernest Sharp, chairman, said trading conditions had worsened in the
second half, but there were now some grounds for optimism.
In the year, the group made an operating profit of Pounds 103.6m (Pounds
187.4m), before exceptional items of Pounds 191.9m (Pounds 9.7m) and
interest payable of Pounds 169.2m (Pounds 159.7m). The net loss was Pounds
346.6m (Pounds 146.2m).
The accounts showed Pounds 700,000 (Pounds 1.91m) had been paid in
compensation to directors whose contracts were terminated.

FT  29 SEP 93 / Sears cautious despite rebound out of the red
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SEARS yesterday joined the growing band of retail groups apparently staging
a recovery after over-expanding in the 1980s, as it transformed a Pounds
97.1m interim loss last year into a Pounds 38.9m profit.
Last year's figure for the group, which includes Selfridges department
store, the Wallis, Adams, and Olympus chains and the Freemans catalogue
business, was depressed by a Pounds 84.3m exceptional loss on disposal of
its men's wear division. There was also a Pounds 32.2m exceptional charge
for restructuring British Shoe Corporation, the footwear division.
This year's figure includes Pounds 7m exceptional profits on the sale of
Sears' stake in Asprey, the upmarket jeweller, and a Pounds 5.5m loss on the
closure of ter Meulen Post, the Dutch mail order business.
Stripping out all exceptionals, the trading profit from on-going businesses
rose 26 per cent, from Pounds 29.8m to Pounds 37.6m for the six months to
July 31.
Group turnover in ongoing business rose 6 per cent overall, to Pounds
913.4m. But the shares closed down 3p at 115p after the company expressed
caution about its prospects.
Mr Geoffrey Maitland Smith, chairman, repeated retailers' fears that tax
increases in the November Budget could damage trading in the crucial
Christmas period.
'We remain cautious about the balance of the year,' he said. 'There is some
current evidence of modest economic improvement but it remains slow and
erratic.'
He added that the recovery at Sears was due more to its own efforts than to
a pick-up in consumer spending.
Mr Liam Strong, chief executive, has taken the group out of men's wear and
restructured British Shoe Corporation, reducing staff by more than 2,000 and
closing unprofitable stores.
Three of the group's four divisions increased trading profits, with British
Shoe showing the biggest improvement, from a Pounds 2.5m loss before
exceptionals to a Pounds 9m profit.
Profits in the high street fashion division fell from Pounds 7m to Pounds
4.8m because of continuing losses at Richards.
Earnings were 1.91p, from a 6.26p loss last year, but the interim dividend
was held at 1p.

FT  29 SEP 93 / IMRO eyes marketing claim
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IMRO, the self-regulatory body for the fund management industry, is
considering possible disciplinary action against Hill Samuel Investment
Management for overstating the performance record in marketing literature
for one of its most successful products.
The literature relates to HSIM's active quantitative fund management
product, an investment technique which relies heavily on using mathematical
models to select stocks based on analysis of large quantities of data.
While HSIM marketed its so-called AVM product using internally generated
performance measurement figures calculated by a Datastream software product,
most clients had their returns monitored by WM Company, an independent
performance measurement firm.
'The Datastream figures tend to be higher rather than lower' than the WM
figures, said Mr Richard Bernays, chief executive of HSIM.
He said that upon discovering the discrepancies last summer, Hill Samuel
brought the matter to Imro's attention itself.
The product, whose marketing literature showed it was able to produce
returns two to four percentage points above the FT-A All-Share Index, barely
matched the index in 1992 and had not performed particularly well this year
either, Mr Bernays said.
Performance returns are the single greatest determinant in a fund manager's
ability to win and keep pension fund clients.
Poor performance, or questions about the validity of a manager's performance
data, would be a serious blow to any investment firm, pension consultants
say.
The team which developed the so-called AVM product, widely regarded as among
the most successful of its type in Britain, left HSIM last October to work
for State Street Global Advisers, a division of the US-based State Street
Bank and Trust Co.
The move is a blow to Hill Samuel and to State Street, which is about to
launch a competing product of its own.
It is also a blow to the proponents of active quant techniques, just as they
were hoping to expand their toehold in the traditional UK asset management
industry.
Mr David Miller, managing director of SSAG, said while he knew of no
discrepancies generally between the way WM Company and Datastream calculated
total returns, 'we generally know of problems of people trying to rebuild
performance figures of earlier years'.
He said that Mr Alan Greenhorn, the architect of the AVM product now
developing a competing product for SSAG, had been asked to assist HSIM in
uncovering its problem.
But because of a confidentiality agreement SSAG could shed no light on what
the problems were.
SSAG agreed to confidentiality 'because Alan and two other colleagues were
former HSIM employees and there were certain restrictions in their HS
contracts which we managed to re-negotiate,' he said.
Mr Bernays suggested that some discrepancy might be explained by what the
possible existence of what he called a 'bug' in the Datastream software,
which affects the way rights issues and tenders are treated.
However, Mr Norman Ireland, marketing manager at Datastream, said he knew of
no problems with the performance measurement product.
'If that's the case, there are an awful lot of clients who use this service
and no one has complained,' he said. He also said he knew of no discussions
with Hill Samuel.

FT  29 SEP 93 / VW demands tough cuts at Seat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SEAT, the loss-making Spanish automotive group, may have to sacrifice one of
its three factories and more than a third of its workforce if it is to meet
tough restructuring demands from its German parent, Volkswagen.
This emerged yesterday after the VW group board rejected a provisional
proposal, presented personally by Mr Juan Antonio Diaz Alvarez, Seat
chairman.
Mr Alvarez returned to Spain under orders to make the seriousness of the
situation plain to his workers and to come back with a plan containing
'creative' rationalisation measures to restore Seat to profit, according to
Mr Otto Ferdinand Wachs for VW.
'They have had DM1.5bn (Pounds 608m) this year. There is no more money for
Seat at Volkswagen,' he said.
Seat, which is heading for a DM1.25bn loss this year, was bailed out 10 days
ago in an intra-group deal under which VW 'bought' the Spanish company's
Pamplona factory and financial services business in return for the DM1.5bn
cash injection.
Mr Alvarez's initial proposal relied too much on hopes of future increases
in volume sales said Mr Hans-Peter Blechinger of VW. 'They have to be able
to break even without higher volumes. The idea is to reduce the break-even
level. Then if demand does grow you make more profit, he said.
Mr Alvarez's suggestion that the 23,000 workforce should be cut by 5,000 in
the medium term is also believed to have been rejected as insufficient.
Seat officials said in Barcelona that Seat's definitive plans were not due
to be presented for two or three weeks.
Although incomplete, these are understood to include the closure of Seat's
Zona Franca works in Barcelona, the transfer of production and some of the
workforce to a new plant at Martorell and the loss of 8,000 to 9,000 jobs.
One reason given for Seat's deficit this year is the high cost of buying
parts from Germany priced in D-Marks with devalued pesetas,
By publicising the outcome of yesterday's board meeting VW appeared to be
fuelling the atmosphere of crisis around Seat.
The unconventional tactics also reflected the frustration of Mr Ferdinand
Piech, the VW chairman, as well as his determination to drive through
radical cost-cutting measures.

FT  29 SEP 93 / The final salary scheme may face retirement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's pensions industry is holding its breath ahead of tomorrow's report
from the Goode Committee. When Robert Maxwell ran off with the Mirror
Group's pension assets his worst crime may have been to ensure that
occupational pension schemes would become buried in extra cost and
regulation.
At stake is the future of the final salary scheme, known in best American
jargon as a defined benefit plan. Under this system the sponsoring
organisation shoulders most of the investment risk in exchange for control
of the design and running of the scheme. The alternative structure, defined
contribution, seeks to offload the investment risk on to the scheme member,
who has no clear idea of what his share of the fund will be worth on his
retirement day, nor of the size of the annuity that the money will then buy.
Fund management companies are on red alert. They would require a drastic
change in both business strategy and investment style to cope with the quite
different demands of defined contribution schemes, where the hopes and fears
of the individual members are paramount, and finance directors count for
little.
It may never happen. Certainly, there has been no substantial shift in
existing schemes to the defined contribution approach in the UK so far. But
Goode could provide a welcome excuse for many companies. They might reckon
that after a long period of unsustainably good investment returns (15 per
cent a year for the average UK scheme over the past 15 years) this could be
an ideal moment to draw a line under the final salary-linking promise.
In the US the move away from defined benefits has been rapid. According to
the Greenwich Associates survey of large US pension schemes, corporate
defined benefit plans have a negative cash flow of more than Dollars 30bn
(Pounds 19.4bn) a year and assets of defined contribution schemes have
climbed from 27 to 35 per cent of the corporate plan aggregate in four
years.
Responsibilities cannot be shed quite so easily, however. In the UK, at any
rate, employers know that if the investments in a defined contribution
scheme go wrong they will still come under pressure to perform a rescue act.
Investment houses are therefore busily devising investment products and
strategies which they hope will meet the emerging need for both high returns
and low volatility.
Life assurance companies used to think they had the answer in the shape of
with-profits plans, which are still used in personal pensions and small
corporate schemes. However, the with-profits formula has come unstuck.
Traditionally based upon fixed-interest portfolios, it has been adapted to
equity investment only with difficulty, and the large element of volatile
terminal bonuses in the pay-out (sometimes as much as 50 per cent) has
destroyed the predictability which used to be the attraction.
Mercury Asset Management, leader in the defined benefit market, has launched
a Guaranteed Fund as the answer for the defined contribution sector. When
making contributions trustees can select dates, probably linked to members'
retirement plans, at which guaranteed values will apply. These values will
rise year by year if the equity market goes up.
One of the life companies, Provident Mutual, some years ago abandoned the
with-profits approach in favour of a new formula called the pension assured
fund, which is now worth more than Pounds 600m. The value of units cannot go
down, and so the benefits are reasonably predictable as retirement
approaches, although the retirement date has to be chosen at the outset.
Elsewhere, Kleinwort Benson Investment Management is launching the Pension
Protection Portfolio, which covers both the annuity and equity market risks.
It is basically a portfolio indexed to long-dated gilt-edged securities, but
beefed up by the purchase of options which will capture equity market
performance when this is positive.
No doubt many more products will appear if the market shifts in the
direction of defined contribution. Some will work, but in other cases
unlucky trustees (and perhaps beneficiaries too) will discover the black
boxes fail to yield their promised magic, due to unforeseeable
circumstances.
In searching for the best of all worlds we may encounter defined
retribution.

Newspapers is expected to be announced today at only a small discount to the
market price, amid signs of considerable interest from institutions.
NM Rothschild and Cazenove, joint lead managers of the offering of the 54.8
per cent stake, which lies in the hands of administrators Arthur Andersen,
closed the formal bookbuilding in the shares last night.
The bookbuilding exercise began on Monday and administrator Mr John Talbot
said he intended to end the process on or before Friday.
Analysts suggested last night that the offer price was likely to be set at
around 175p, representing only a small discount to last night's closing
price of 177p.
Institutions were able to bid for blocks of shares at specific prices or at
the price to be determined as the offer price.
If the offer price does turn out to be around 175p, it will be seen as a
considerable achievement for Mr Talbot, the MGN management and the merchant
banks which handled the offer.
'It's placing power and talk of relative cheapness that has done the job,'
Mr Derek Terrington, media analyst at stockbrokers Kleinwort Benson said
last night.
Other analysts expect there to be a strong after-market in MGN shares and
suggest the price could go to 200p almost immediately. At one stage MGN
shares were worth only 50p.
The way was cleared for the offering by an unexpectedly large bounce in
profits, announced last month by the newspaper group. In the six months to
June 27, pre-tax profits shot up from Pounds 15.3m to Pounds 69.9m.
The successful completion of the offer should raise more than Pounds 350m
for secured and unsecured creditors of the Robert Maxwell Group, Robert
Maxwell's private company.
Most of the money will go to banks such as National Westminster, Goldman
Sachs, Midland and Lloyds who accepted MGN shares as security for Maxwell
loans.
The Daily Mirror has not been hurt so far by the decision of its rival The
Sun to cut its cover price to 20p. The Daily Mirror has stuck to its 27p
price.
The offering was led by NM Rothschild and Cazenove.

FT  29 SEP 93 / Yeltsin troops seal off parliament: Tension rises as Moscow
riot police disperse 3,000 demonstrators
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Boris Yeltsin sealed off the White House, or Russian parliament,
with barbed wire, troops and trucks yesterday and ordered its defenders to
hand over their weapons by 11am Moscow time today - 9am in London.
The cordon, the biggest deployment of force since Mr Yeltsin's decree
dissolving parliament a week ago, is designed to step up pressure on
deputies and their guards. It may stay in place for some days.
With tension rising, about 3,000 anti-Yeltsin demonstrators last night
commandeered trolley buses and blocked two of Moscow's main roads near the
parliament. But the crowd never looked threatening and riot police with
clubs and shields dispersed them with little trouble.
Mr Oleg Soskovets, first deputy prime minister, said tough measures would
soon be taken to remove the 100 or so deputies and their supporters still in
the parliament building.
He repeated that the building would not be stormed.
People wanting to leave the White House were ushered through the security
cordon but not allowed back. The cordon was erected through main
thoroughfares, back streets, playgrounds and apartment block backyards,
including the US Embassy compound and the former Comecon building, now
housing - among others - the office of the International Monetary Fund.
Inside the darkened, unheated building, Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, the
parliamentary speaker, told the few journalists who found themselves inside
the lines that surrender was not on his agenda. 'We are not going to use
arms (first) but if there is an attempt to storm it (parliament), we will
rebuff it,' he said. 'Blood spilt will be on the hands of those who support
the coup d'etat.'
The Interior Ministry said greatly increased security was justified, given
the number of weapons within the building, displayed by defenders before
television cameras in earlier days, and the mental state of those holding
them. It, too, said its troops were not about to attack.
An official of Krasnopresnenskaya district council, one of many in Moscow
that voiced opposition to Mr Yeltsin, said that deputies shut out of the
parliament were preparing a 'parliament in exile'.
Earlier, Mr Yeltsin ruled out any compromise - especially that which seems
to have most support, to convene simultaneous parliamentary and presidential
elections. He stuck to his plan for elections to a new-style parliament on
December 11-12 and presidential elections on June 12.
Meanwhile the Russian Orthodox Patriarch Alexei II - before whom Mr Yeltsin
took his oath of office as president - cut short a visit to the US to plead
with 'all branches of power in Russia' to 'reach a reasonable compromise' on
the political crisis.

FT  29 SEP 93 / Councils will face cost of cover if firefighters strike
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PRESSURE on local authorities to settle their pay dispute with
firefighters increased yesterday after Mr Michael Howard, home secretary,
told employers that they must meet the full financial cost of emergency
cover in the event of any strikes.
The employers said that would probably cost them far more than meeting the
pay claim in full.
Mr Howard gave an equally blunt message that the firefighters must not have
any wage rise in November higher than the government's 1.5 per cent
public-sector pay limit for this year.
'There is no justification whatsoever for giving firefighters preferential
treatment this year,' he told them. 'They are expecting a special deal when
over 3m employees - including doctors, nurses and police officers - have
already accepted pay settle-ments of 1.5 per cent or below.'
Mr Ken Cameron, the Fire Brigades' Union general secretary, said a dispute
now looked 'inevitable'. 'This is an extremely dangerous situation. To put
the public at risk for what is a marginal amount of money to settle the
dispute is a nonsense,' he said.
The local authorities may well decide to defy the government's pay policy by
meeting the firefighters' wage formula award in full to avoid industrial
conflict - although perhaps in stages.
The government's earnings survey for 1993, to be published tomorrow, will
provide the basis for the pay award sought by firefighters. Their pay rises
have been linked since 1978 to the annual increase in earnings of the upper
quartile of male manual workers. If this year's figure, based on the 12
months to April, is not much above 1.5 per cent, the employers are expected
to settle.
The crucial negotiating session between the employers and the leaders of the
FBU will be on Friday.
If that fails to secure a settlement, the union's 50,000 members will be
asked to vote from next Monday for a series of one-day strikes. They would
begin on November 8 or shortly afterwards if a majority support action.
Mr Howard told the employers the government had no objection to the
restoration of the firefighters' pay formula in 1994 but he also warned them
no extra cash would be available from the government to pay for it.
The employers told him that local authorities who had their spending
programmes already capped by the government might be unable to meet next
year's firefighters' pay award, while other councils would be forced to cut
staffing levels and safety standards in order to meet next year's wage bill.

FT  29 SEP 93 / Opec divided over production quotas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TALKS aimed at allocating new quotas to the 12 members of the Organisation
of Petroleum Exporting Countries ran into trouble in Geneva yesterday as
Kuwait, Iran and the United Arab Emirates resisted efforts to cut their
preferred production levels.
A full ministerial meeting due to be held yesterday to discuss proposed
quotas was postponed until noon today to allow a sub-committee of three
ministers and Mr Subroto, Opec's secretary-general, to continue negotiations
with individual dele-gations.
Kuwait, whose reintegration into Opec's new production ceiling of 24.5m
barrels a day was one of the main goals of the meeting, is understood to
have demanded no change to its present output of 2.16m b/d.
Kuwait left the production arrangement last June, complaining that the quota
offered to it was not large enough to make up for output lost during the
Gulf crisis.
Under one of the most widely discussed plans to split up the Opec production
ceiling for the fourth quarter of this year, Kuwait would be granted a quota
of 2m b/d, compared with its previous quota of 1.6m b/d.
An Arab delegate suggested there was a split in the Kuwaiti delegation, with
one faction willing to compromise to reach an agreement being opposed by a
hardline group.
One Kuwaiti delegate remarked: 'We enjoyed being out of the arrangement, it
was quite painless.'
Iran, which has a current quota of 3.34m b/d, is understood to be holding
out for more than the reported offer of 3.6m b/d.
The UAE apparently rejected a proposal that it freeze production in order to
help Opec to accommodate higher outputs from larger members, such as Iran
and Nigeria, whose economic problems are more pressing.
According to Arab sources, the UAE is said to have demanded a pro rata or
somewhat lower increase.
The gap between the 1.96m b/d quota demanded by Nigeria and that on offer is
reported to have narrowed significantly yesterday and is unlikely to prove
to be a barrier to any agreement. The demands of the eight other Opec
members also do not appear to pose a threat to an agree-ment, according to
the Arab delegate.
Any suggestion that Opec might have to raise the production ceiling set on
Monday to accommodate the demands of Kuwait, Iran and the UAE is likely to
be strongly opposed by a number of other members, including Saudi Arabia,
the biggest producer, which has agreed to freeze its quota of 8m b/d.

FT  29 SEP 93 / The Lex Column: Great Portland
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Great Portland Estates is at pains to stress the generosity of Mr Richard
Peskin, its chairman, in giving up Basil &amp; Howard Samuel. Doubtless, there
is considerable sacrifice involved since Mr Peskin has long paid himself a
handsome salary from Samuel which has the exclusive contract to manage Great
Portland's rental properties. But the sacrifice is difficult to measure
since no one knew how much Mr Peskin was actually receiving. All that can be
said is that his remuneration under the new arrangements is so extravagant
that he must have been on to a very good thing indeed.
Not only is he to receive a Pounds 375,000 one-off payment. He also gets a
new managing director's salary of Pounds 325,000 fixed for two years without
any apparent connection to performance. On a three-year rolling contract, he
would cost Pounds 1m to sack. Institutions can claim some satisfaction that
the notice period is shorter than the five years prescribed before. But
there can be little happiness with a deal that so mocks the Cadbury spirit.
Great Portland will not separate the roles of chairman and chief executive
and lacks strong non-executive directors from outside the property scene. Mr
Peskin may feel he has made a great sacrifice. But the corporate governance
is not yet good, and he can still amply afford champagne at lunchtime.

FT  29 SEP 93 / The Lex Column: Siebe
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There are two reasons why Siebe's management changes are more than routine.
The first is that they carry the personal stamp of Mr Allen Yurko, who is to
become chief executive next year when Mr Barrie Stephens hives that role off
from the chairmanship. The second is that they increase the group's focus on
the upper end of the system controls market which is grouped around Foxboro.
Such a shift in emphasis may be natural given the 16.3 per cent margins
Siebe earned from its controls division last year. But much of this
originates from Foxboro, where the earnings contribution has been boosted by
cost-cutting.
With the rationalisation phase now largely over, Foxboro must turn its
attention to increasing volume and market share. Its achievement in this
regard - its share of the US controls market has increased from 6 per cent
to around 10 per cent over the past couple of years - has already brought it
into head-on confrontation with Honeywell. Siebe is suing its rival over
marketing literature which it regards as defamatory. Since Honeywell will
not give further ground easily, Foxboro, whose tactic is to seek a
reputation for quality, may find its margins suffering.
Siebe may thus face a choice between the hard slog of organic growth and the
short cut of buying market share through acquisition. The hard part for Mr
Yurko will be to find the right companies at the right price. As other
acquisitive companies are finding, there are not many suitable targets
around.

FT  29 SEP 93 / The Lex Column: Sears
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
To be fair, Sears' top management has never pretended that the company's
recovery would be rapid. A sleepy and introspective culture takes time to
shift and outdated retail operations take time to overhaul. The shortage of
good management throughout the retail industry makes it difficult for the
company to recruit enough of the people it needs. That said, many changes
have been made at lower levels within the operating companies and some of
the benefits have already been felt in the partial revival of the British
Shoe Corporation. Unnecessary distractions such as housebuilding, menswear
and a stake in Asprey have been dealt with.
Yet the company remains a sprawling empire, almost all of which still needs
serious attention. The Olympus sports goods chain may face competition from
out of town 'category killers' before long, but is as yet only testing its
own new format. British Shoe and Freemans still need a lot of detailed work,
while recently-acquired Richards lost money in the first half despite cost
cuts and Selfridges continues to absorb management time.
The strain shows in the way that the chief executive, Mr Liam Strong,
appears to be involved in quite detailed operational decisions. While that
is probably a good way for a non-retailer to get to grips with the business,
it may not provide the momentum required to deal with the competitive
threats and shock the organisation into a new attitude. Either Sears needs a
tighter focus or Mr Strong needs some new highly-powered lieutenants on the
company's main board. His desire to work with the existing structure is
laudable. But the need is pressing.

FT  29 SEP 93 / The Lex Column: Minorco digs deep
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The shuffling of assets between Minorco and its South African parents is
motivated by more than a desire for geographic neatness. Anglo American is
shedding mining assets which could require substantial capital expenditure
in currencies other than rand. Minorco has cash in abundance to fund such
investment, and can claim another stride towards becoming a genuine natural
resources group rather than a piggy-bank for South African interests.
Whether a wholly independent Minorco would have wanted to extend its
position in pulp and paper - or take a stake in TransAtlantic, Mr Donald
Gordon's insurance and property vehicle - is open to question.
If the deal helps close the discount to net assets at which Minorco's shares
now trade, shareholders might anyway applaud. But there is room for doubt in
this regard. By taking shares rather than cash, Anglo American's influence
over Minorco is increased. That will be scant comfort to investors wary of
buying into a minority position. The deal does nothing in the short term to
address the question of Minorco's Dollars 1.1bn cash pile. Without hard
evidence that management can spend wisely, the discount is likely to remain.
Still, Minorco seems to be buying some attractive base metals reserves at
the bottom of the cycle. Profits should eventually benefit further out when
metals prices rise. Exactly when that will show through in the form of
increased earnings per share is difficult to fathom. Profits from the
acquired assets will have to rise smartly from last year's meagre Dollars
30m to make up for the issue of another slug of shares. There could be
something of a wait.

FT  29 SEP 93 / A walk on the wild side: What J P Morgan can gain from a
tie-up with a controversial Spanish bank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER and PETER BRUCE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two huddles are gathered outside the large, ornate office of Mr Mario Conde,
chairman of Spain's fourth-largest bank. In one are the relaxed doormen
employed by Mr Conde's Banco Espanol de Credito (Banesto). In the other are
the jet-lagged executives of J P Morgan, the US corporate bank. They have
also been hired by Banesto to open doors - in their case, to international
capital markets. They are working on a Dollars 400m convertible bond issue,
planned for next month.
J P Morgan and Banesto have virtually nothing in common apart from being
banks. The former is an august corporate bank that alone among its US peers
has retained the top AAA assessment of creditworthiness from rating agencies
despite a 20-year squeeze on margins in its old lending business. The other
is a 2,300-branch retail bank whose poorer credit rating has just been put
down a notch because of bad lending in the 1980s. It remains enmeshed in a
holding company with stakes in industries from cement-making to wine
production.
But Banesto's relationship with Morgan has transformed its image among
investors. Money has poured into Mr Conde's bank since Morgan disclosed in
February that Banesto would be the first investment to be made by Morgan's
Dollars 1.1bn Corsair investment fund, set up in the US to buy stakes in
undervalued banks. Banesto's shares have risen 50 per cent since the Morgan
announcement, despite its decision not to pay a final dividend for 1992 - it
may not pay one this year either.
Mr Conde's critics in Madrid's financial community still harbour their
doubts about Banesto, but it is difficult to dispute his assessment of the
bank's new-found popularity. 'Was there ever such a capital increase in the
history of the European banking system?' he asks. 'No] After that it is hard
for me to believe the market is sceptical.'
The Dollars 400m convertible bond issue will be the final part of an attempt
to lift Banesto's capital to the levels of other Spanish banks. Banesto has
already raised Pta94bn (Dollars 876m) capital by issuing new shares since
May. Mr Conde's personal purchase of shares worth Pta6.4bn has helped to
persuade thousands of first-time buyers to purchase shares worth Pta19.7bn
through Banesto's branches. But he does not deny that the link with Morgan
has attracted the solid US investors which own 90 per cent of the Corsair
fund. 'Would there have been a capital issue without J P Morgan? The answer
is no]' Mr Conde exclaims.
Banesto's relationship with Morgan has brought it undoubted benefits. The
unresolved question is whether Morgan will reap similar rewards. If Banesto
fails to transform itself into the efficient retail bank with superior
technology that Morgan believes it can be, Corsair's first venture will
fail. Morgan's image as a talented investor of other people's capital in
equities that are undervalued by world markets would also be tarnished.
Damage to its reputation could set back Morgan's own effort to change from a
lending bank into one modelled on British merchant banks of the past - with
relatively few blue-chip corporate clients, but offering a wide range of
services from advice to risk management and securities underwriting. Such
operations are less risky than lending, but alone may not provide high
enough returns on Morgan's capital base. So Morgan has also taken to
investing capital in equities.
Responsibility for the Banesto venture falls on Mr Roberto Mendoza, a
quietly spoken Cuban. Mr Mendoza, who is a Morgan vice-chairman and
Corsair's representative on Banesto's board, formerly headed its mergers and
acquisitions side. Morgan has only Dollars 17.5m of Corsair's total Dollars
175m capital at stake in Banesto. But he acknowledges the potential risk to
Morgan's standing. 'We must get it right because we are investing our
reputation. That is the biggest kind of risk we can take,' he says.
Morgan first encountered Banesto in November 1989 when it was hired to
advise Mr Conde. Its advisers, led by Ms Violy de Harper, a managing
director of its corporate advisory arm, set to work to untangle the
run-down, family-controlled bank taken over by Mr Conde two years before. It
had been founded to channel money into railways, construction and mining,
and remained half bank and half industrial conglomerate.
Mr Conde and a former friend, Mr Juan Abello, flush with the profits from
the sale of a Spanish pharmaceuticals company to Montedison, the Italian
chemicals group, bought a 4 per cent stake in Banesto just as its ageing and
fractious family owners had been shaken by the near success of a takeover
bid for Banesto by Banco de Bilbao, then one of Spain's big three commercial
banks. His arrival upset Spain's cosy banking fraternity and triggered the
collapse of the cartel within which Spanish banks determined interest rates
on investments and loans.
Banesto's management and organisation were in a mess. Little had been
invested in its branches since 1975. Its employees were poorly paid, and
many had second jobs. It had absorbed smaller troubled banks on the
suggestion of the Bank of Spain, the central bank, and in early 1988 was
told to set aside money against Pta100bn of poor loans. Mr Conde's first two
years were spent in a flurry of activity. 'There were few accounts. It was
impossible to tell where the losses were coming from,' he says. He chose not
to disclose the whole truth about Banesto's plight to shareholders.
'I could have gone to a shareholders' meeting and told them: 'Gentlemen, I
told you the accounts said the 1987 profit of the bank was this, but that is
not true. And we have to invest this amount . . . ' What would have been
their reaction? They would have left the bank,' he says. Instead, he started
to invest Dollars 600m in new technology, branch refurbishment and improved
wages. In 1990, he created a holding company to control the bank's various
industrial interests.
Morgan came to believe that Banesto's tangled history obscured its true
worth. Its shares were trading at a discount to the value of its assets in
1989; Morgan thought this value could be unlocked by stripping out the bank
from the holding company. This would also focus the management on its core
business. But the move was partly making a virtue of necessity; the Bank of
Spain told banks last year that they would have to reduce industrial
holdings not consolidated in their accounts to 20 per cent of capital by
1998. Banesto currently has 39 per cent of capital in such holdings and so
is forced to offload some of its industrial interests.
'It was not a matter of yelling 'Eureka' in the bathtub, but the more we
delved into it, the more we came to the view that Banesto had a very large
unexploited franchise value in the pure retail bank,' says Mr Mendoza.
Morgan believed Banesto had to do two things to realise this value. One was
to sell a significant proportion of the industrial assets. The second was to
raise capital in order to relaunch itself with the strength to deal
comfortably with its bad debts.
The need to raise capital has been questioned by observers. Banesto had less
capital than its Spanish peers, but its ratios of capital to assets were
already comfortably in excess of international standards. This has led some
analysts to ask whether it really wants the money to spend on as yet
undisclosed problems with loans or industrial assets. Mr Mendoza says the
capital partly provides comfort - stopping it from being rushed into selling
assets - but mainly allows a break with the past.
'If you are the least-well-capitalised retail bank among your peers, and
there have been controversies, it is clear that you derive competitive
advantage from putting the issue to rest once and for all,' he says. 'You
become the master of your own destiny.'
Banesto's attempts to change its destiny have opened up opportunities for
Morgan. The Spanish bank has provided a target for Corsair. The fund - named
after J P Morgan's yacht, bought in 1882 - operates at the boundary drawn by
the 1933 Glass-Steagall Act between banks and investment banks. J P Morgan
chose then to stay a bank, but has increasingly tested the divide as
corporate lending has lost its allure.
Although Morgan has a Dollars 1.3bn equities portfolio, Corsair is its first
equity fund since 1933. The idea is to acquire partners in equity
investments, since Morgan is barred by US regulators from holding more than
4.9 per cent of a company. Corsair now holds 7.9 per cent of Banesto. J P
Morgan believed that by combining its advisory expertise with what Mr
Mendoza calls the 'sponsorship value' of its name, it could spot undervalued
companies and realise annual returns of 30 per cent for investors.
Morgan is now considering funds similar to Corsair for insurance and real
estate investment, but banking was an obvious place to start. When Morgan
had the idea two years ago, there were many ripe targets in the US among
banks which had suffered asset quality problems in the 1980s and whose share
prices were low. But it hit regulatory obstacles from the Federal Reserve,
and bank shares had rallied by the time the deadline for investing in
Corsair passed in February. Morgan was forced to look elsewhere for
undervalued bank shares instead.
Despite the problems of poor loans common to most banks in the 1980s, Morgan
believed retail banks in particular were good long-term investments. There
is a wistful tone in Mr Mendoza's voice as he describes their attractions.
Spanish banks have an average margin between interest they pay on deposits
and charge on loans of about 3.8 per cent. This compares with a fraction of
1 per cent on big corporate loans. 'High-street banking may not appear very
glamorous, but it can produce glamorous returns. They say corporate banking
is more glamorous but anyone in it would wonder why,' he says.
Banesto was particularly attractive because its shares were trading at a
fifth of the price of Banco Popular, Spain's most profitable bank. Banesto
had also avoided any overlap between its branches because it was not the
product of a merger, like some rivals such as Banco Bilbao Vizcaya. But
these qualities had not attracted investors before it was given Corsair's
stamp of approval. This raises the question of whether there was a conflict
of interest in Morgan investing money in the shares of a Morgan client,
though there has been no regulatory disapproval.
Mr Mendoza seems hurt at the suggestion of conflict. 'I sincerely hope not.
That would be terrible,' he says. He argues that Banesto was simply the best
available investment, and Corsair is now considering other banks with which
Morgan has no relationship. Mr Mendoza is more concerned that Banesto will
not produce the returns that Corsair requires. Corsair is committed to
remaining as a Banesto shareholder, and 'intends' to stay for five years.
But the sharp rise in Banesto's shares will have to continue past the
initial burst of enthusiasm to meet its overall 30 per cent annual
investment return target.
A possible bone of contention is the degree to which Mr Conde shares the
vision of Banesto as a 'cleanly focused retail bank' that Morgan presents to
investors. Mr Conde says Banesto will be primarily a retail bank in Spain,
but will hold equity investments. 'We have the opportunity to use part of
our equity to invest in non-financials, and make capital gains. Let's do
it,' he says.
Mr Mendoza downplays the possibility of tension. He says that Corsair is 'in
the business of picking managements to back, not second-guessing them'. He
argues that Mr Conde's abrasive tactics may have upset traditionalists in
the Spanish banking sector, but a strong character is needed to revitalise
Banesto. 'This is a turnround, and a successful turnround needs decisiveness
and leadership,' he says. Morgan is also barred by US law from exercising a
'controlling influence' on Banesto. So Corsair may simply have to wait
patiently to see if its first bet pays off.
'My own sense is that this is very low risk, although you can argue as to
how good the returns will be,' says Mr Mendoza. But a safe, mediocre return
carries its own risk. If Banesto does not transform itself as Morgan has
predicted, investors will not have the same faith in Corsair's next choice.
It has already earned big fees for bringing investors to Mr Conde's door; it
remains to be seen whether its reward will be large enough.

FT  29 SEP 93 / Leading Article: The test before John Smith
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN SMITH's address to the Labour party in Brighton yesterday was
well-balanced, competently delivered, nicely judged to suit the occasion -
and totally unexciting. This is only partly explained by the Labour leader's
naturally conservative manner.
Mr Smith's difficulty is that he was attempting to maintain party unity
while at the same time reshaping Labour to make it electable once again. 'I
shouldn't be too hard on John Major,' the Labour leader said. 'He is
beginning to understand what his party's made of.' Mr Smith might have been
addressing a mirror: he, too, has discovered that modern parties can be
awkward beasts to control. Labour's long-standing divisions - today between
traditionalists and modernisers, yesterday between followers of Mr Tony Benn
and Mr Denis Healey, earlier still between Gaitskellites and Bevanites - are
notoriously difficult to reconcile.
In his speech Mr Smith sought to square the circle. He projected himself as
a man of stature, demonstrated that he can knock the Conservatives about as
well as anyone, and appealed to his party's moral sensibilities. A picture
was painted of Labour saving the country from ruin. To make assurance doubly
sure, he sought to appease the appetites of the trade unions that threaten
his plans for internal party reform.
Familiar list
The man of stature addressed the problems of the world, referring to the
Labour party's 'proud history of international action'. The hammer of the
Tories, reminiscent of his best House of Commons performances, drew
attention to 'casino economics', homelessness, crime, Mr Major's misfortunes
and the rest of a familiar list, ending with a workmanlike peroration on the
anger of the British people at the 'chronic failure of this discredited
government'. The moral tone, the outrage at inequalities and unfairness in
British society, came from the heart of Mr Smith the Scottish Presbyterian.
True to his personal values, he can sing no other song.
The Labour leader also undertook to save Britain from decline, to rescue it
from unemployment. His promise to attune Labour's policies to the goal of
full employment was first given widespread publicity at the recent
conference of the Trades Union Congress. It has now become the central
objective of the opposition's economic programme, just as constitutional
reform has been brought to the forefront of its political platform.
Minimum wage
More immediately to the point, Mr Smith re-iterated proposals on regulation
of the labour market that would make the attainment of full employment even
more difficult to achieve than it already looks. The pledge to introduce a
minimum wage and reconstitute the wages council was renewed. Labour's
'charter of employment rights' covers protection against unfair dismissal,
the right to join a trade union and the right to union recognition. Its
provisions would apply from the first day of hiring. The new protections
would be enjoyed by full-time, part-time and temporary workers alike. In
such circumstances, every employer would think twice before adding to the
labour force.
All of the above are becoming constant Smith themes. They were played
yesterday with one overriding purpose in mind: to swing votes at the
conference today towards accepting the Labour leader's proposal that
parliamentary candidates be elected by party members and not by a
combination of Labour and trade union franchises. This should be a minor
matter. 'One member one vote', or 'omov', would leave unions in a strong
position in constituency general management committees, in party leadership
contests and in the party conference itself. It would not amount to the
degree of separation necessary if the Labour party is to be genuinely
independent of the unions.
That said, 'omov' has become a touchstone: if it passes, Mr Smith will
regard himself, and be regarded by many, as having demonstrated that elected
politicians, not a handful of union leaders, control his party. If it falls,
either entirely or into a sea of procedural fudge, Mr Smith will be seen to
have lost authority and the modernisation of the Labour party will have come
to a grinding halt. Not all news these days is bad news for the
Conservatives.

Visitors to the ludicrously cheap canteen enjoyed by officials at the

countries across the globe on the infinite virtues of eliminating
market-distorting subsidies.
While the meals remain inexpensive, delegates to this year's annual meeting
detect a welcome move in the direction of pricing transparency. The
coin-operated espresso machine at last reveals the price of a cup - 55
cents; visitors no longer need to contribute to the subsidies by guessing

Labour MPs may whinge about their colleagues from the Conservative party
having a monopoly on City sinecures, but one can perhaps see why. Ejected
from Labour's national executive at the beginning of the week, Tony Benn was
yesterday affecting a distinctly shaky grasp of demarcations in the British
financial world.
Deploring supposedly highfalutin media reporting of economic affairs and
pointing out that pensioners are not in the habit of dumping their D-Marks
after the TV evening news, Benn lamented how 'when there is a crisis, people
always go and ask some chartered accountant at Kleinwort Benson'.
Merchant bankers KB yesterday owned up to 51 accountants on the pay roll
'any of whom would be most flattered to be consulted in an economic crisis'.

Then, when there is absolutely no chance of escape, the ladies and gentlemen

The progenitor of the cloudburst will be Paul Simons, chairman of Simons

FT  29 SEP 93 / Observer: A gaggle of governors
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Whether there was an unseemly press of chairmen of City merchant banks after
the services of former Bank of England governor Sir Robin Leigh-Pemberton,
now Lord Kingsdown, remains unclear, but at least one spokesman was able to
confirm that his bank had not been rushing to hire Lord Kingsdown. 'Who's
he?' asked the gentleman, whose blushes Observer will save.
Former governors of the Bank have proved a versatile lot in their third age,
though it is certainly a very long time since one actually graced the main
board of a British merchant bank, as Lord Kingsdown is about to do at
Hambros.
Lord Richardson (governor from 1973-83) is now chairman of US investment
bank Morgan Stanley International, while Lord O' Brien (1966-73) became a
consultant to JP Morgan, though he also sat on Morgan Grenfell's
international advisory council. Lord Cromer (1961-66) later became British
ambassador to Washington, while Lord Cobbold (1949-1961) perhaps had the
most entertaining time. He became Lord Chamberlain of her Majesty's
Household, at a time when it was still the remit of that office to censor
stage plays.
While Hambros may not these days be at the very top of the merchant banking
tree, it has long sustained something of a special relationship with the
Bank. It was called upon in the course of a number of local difficulties -
in the aftermath of Johnson Matthey and during the international tin crisis,
which are likely to remain fixed in Lord Kingsdown's memory for some time to
come.
And, while the in-house cricket team may be in need of an injection of
enthusiasm from the new non-executive, it is also to be hoped Lord Kingsdown
will find the time to explore the croquet lawn on the roof of the car park
on one of those slow days.

FT  29 SEP 93 / Leading Article: End game in the Gatt
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
OCTOBER IS likely to determine whether the Uruguay Round of multilateral
trade negotiations will be completed by the multilaterally agreed deadline
of December 15. During this month the outlines of a total deal on market
access needs to be completed if the timetable set out by the Gatt's
director-general, Mr Peter Sutherland, is to be met. This is achievable -
and must be achieved.
In deciding what to do, leaders of the few countries with a decisive say in
the outcome should ask themselves three simple questions. Whether or not
they accept the World Bank's estimate that success might raise world income
by Dollars 213bn in 2002, do they doubt that the world economy would be in a
healthier state with a successful round than without it? Do they deny that
relations, particularly among the main economic powers, would rest on a more
solid foundation if there were a credible trading system than if there were
not? Do they doubt that the issues which divide them are trivial, set not
only against the gains, but also against what has been agreed in the round?
What then are the principal remaining issues? On market access, the most
difficult ones include: US and EC demands for greater opening of the markets
for financial services of developing countries and Japan, particularly in
new financial products; the US demand for liberal access to the EC market
for audio-visual services; demands for wider access to the US market for
maritime services; demands from both the US and the Cairns group of
agricultural exporters for access to the agricultural markets of the EC,
Japan and the Republic of Korea; and developing country demands for lower
textile tariffs, particularly in the US.
French insistence
Disagreements also remain over the new rules and procedures embodied in the
Dunkel draft and modified, in the case of agriculture, by what was agreed at
Blair House in November 1992. Mr Sutherland hopes that these issues can be
dealt with in November, after conditional agreements over market access have
been reached. On agriculture the EC has so far been rebuffed in trying to
renegotiate, modify or reinterpret Blair House, at French insistence. The
trickiest other issue may be anti-dumping, where the US demand for action
against 'circumvention' of anti-dumping duties will be fiercely resisted. As
for the multilateral trade organisation, many in the US loathe the name. But
what it stands for, an integrated and effective dispute settlement regime,
must be created at the end of the round, whatever it is to be called.
These are all controversial issues. But compared with the chasm in 1986,
what divides the EC and US in agriculture today is a centimetre. The US
should really be able to agree to tariffs on textiles comparable to those of
the EC. It should also be able to permit countries to subsidise domestic
film production for cultural reasons.
Hysterical opposition
The biggest challenges now are those facing the US and the EC, simply
because they are the most significant players. In the former, perhaps the
greatest danger is spillover from the hysterical opposition to the North
American Free Trade Agreement. The president made the great mistake of
allowing opponents of Nafta to make all the running in the public debate for
eight months. Now it may be too late. But if Nafta were to be voted down in
congress, Mr Clinton would be gravely weakened, as would the cause of
liberal trade. However ineptly trade has been handled by the administration
thus far, Mr Clinton must now retrieve lost ground, by making the passing of
Nafta and agreement on the Uruguay round his highest priorities over the
next few months.
As for the EC, its leaders need to recognise that the prime French demand in
agriculture - to make the world safe for dumping of subsidised commodities -
is not merely hypocritical, set against the EC's general stance on dumping,
but is detested by many more countries than just the US. If refusal to
accept what has been agreed at Blair House destroys the round, the EC will
be universally blamed for the catastrophe. The outcome will not be a world
divided into several trading blocks. It is far more likely to be one in
which the EC is set against virtually everyone else.

FT  29 SEP 93 / West's best bet: Boris Yeltsin's bid to broaden the
democratic base deserves support
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD MORTIMER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Russian legislators are reported to be confused by western support for
President Boris Yeltsin's attempt to abolish the legislature. They are not
alone. Many people in the west instinctively condemn any ruler who dissolves
an elected parliament and asserts his own supreme authority. That was clear
enough in the past year, when Peru's President Alberto Fujimori suspended
the constitution and dissolved Congress, even though inside Peru his
popularity rocketed to unprecedented levels.
Since then, Mr Fujimori has managed to reduce inflation, to stabilise a weak
economy, and to conduct a successful counter-offensive against the Sendero
Luminoso guerrillas who were terrorising the countryside and, increasingly,
the cities. This was what Mr Fujimori was elected to do, and it had become
clear that he could not do it if he stuck to the letter of the constitution.
Easy enough for liberals in New York to purse their lips; not so easy to
offer a better answer to Peru's problems.
Yet the lip-pursing may have been right and necessary. But for the sanctions
imposed by the US (mainly through the World Bank and the International
Monetary Fund), Mr Fujimori might have thought he could run the country in
such a manner indefinitely. At least now he is holding a referendum on a new
constitution, which will allow the election of a new congress; and he has
had to keep a tighter rein on human rights violations by his security forces
than he might otherwise have done.
Mr Yeltsin, for his part, knows very well he would not get away with
indefinite presidential rule. When he dissolved parliament last week he
simultaneously fixed new elections for December. This point is surely more
important than the question of the legitimacy of the parliament's original
election in March 1990.
At the time, the election was seen as a victory for democracy, or for
'pro-democracy campaigners', at least in the big cities. But, the Financial
Times reported, 'party officials have managed to hang on to control of many
outlying regional soviets (councils), and may still end up with a majority
in the Russian parliament'. The party in question was, of course, the
Communist party, by then beginning to disintegrate but the only party able
to contest the elections as even a semi-organised force. Its official
monopoly of power had been dropped from the Soviet constitution only the
previous month.
Mr Yeltsin was eventually elected president, or speaker, on the third
ballot, by a margin of four votes. Much more decisive was his election as
president by universal suffrage the following year.
But even if the election of 1990 were democratic, it would hardly change the
issue. What Mr Yeltsin is doing is something provided for in most west
European constitutions when there is an irreconcilable clash between the
executive and the legislature: you 'go to the country' and let the people
decide. That was what Mr John Major was threatening to do last July when he
made his handling of the social protocol to the Maastricht treaty the
subject of a vote of confidence. Had he lost, the Queen would have dissolved
Parliament and there would have been a general election.
The French president has the same power. Charles de Gaulle used it twice (in
1962 and 1968); Francois Mitterrand did so immediately on his election in
1981, and again on his re-election in 1988 - on both occasions because by
electing him the voters had, in effect, disavowed the sitting National
Assembly. It was logical to give them a chance to choose a new assembly
reflecting their current preferences.
In Mr Yeltsin's case, the electorate explicitly confirmed its confidence in
him and (by a narrower margin) his economic policies in a referendum last
April. In spite of that, he has agreed to hold a new presidential election
next June (two years before the expiry of his mandate). He might be better
advised to hold the two elections simultaneously, but he is surely not
obliged to do so, provided he accepts the parliament elected in December and
appoints a government that enjoys its confidence.
A majority of votes was also cast last April in favour of the dissolution of
parliament. Unfortunately he could not act on it because the constitutional
court had ruled that this required a majority of eligible voters. Thus those
who failed to turn out were counted as votes against.
Mr Yeltsin has now decided to ignore that ruling and to act as the majority
of those who actually voted wanted him to do. In so doing he has violated
the constitution. But that constitution dates from the Brezhnev era. It has
been amended about 400 times, but by parliamentary, not popular, votes. It
was written for a country which was part of the Soviet Union, and in which
the Communist party was to have a permanent monopoly of power. When that
monopoly was abolished and the Soviet Union broke up it would have been
logical for the Russian people, who were, in effect, founding a new national
state, to adopt a new constitution. But in revolutions things are not always
done logically.
The problems facing Russia now are hardly less than those that faced Peru
last year. In fact, given the size of the country, its ethnic diversity, and
the legacy (both economic and political) of 70 years of communism, they can
surely be considered much greater. Many Russians doubt whether they can be
solved democratically, or at all. So far, Mr Yeltsin is still trying to
introduce a democratic constitution, to carry the people with him at each
stage of his reforms, and to avoid a recourse to violence. So long as he
behaves like that, he deserves support.

<TEXT>
With reference to your story 'Interest in ethics codes increases' (September
25), similar codes are likely to be introduced for National Health Service
board members in the next few months. A recent Gallup poll showed that
voters believe their political leaders to be dishonest, too predictable in
what they say, and lacking in all humility. The German election results show
far right parties recording the strongest election showing in years. The
Poles have voted for a return of communism. The British electorate is losing
faith in politicians. Voters are alienated from existing parties and are
relieving their frustrations by backing extremist organisations such as the
BNP. The Nazis came to power in Germany by a democratic vote of a similar
proportion to that of the BNP in Tower Hamlets.
The situation is serious, and urgent measures are required. I would propose
that an all-party commission should examine the adoption of a comprehensive
code of ethics for anyone who seeks election to office. The present
squabbling between Labour and the Liberal Democrats over the Tower Hamlets
election result might have been avoided, had there been such a code. It
would prevent a situation where the prime minister, drumming up business
abroad, is distracted by sniping at home.

FT  29 SEP 93 / Hot air rises round cool decisions: The economic and
political cases for breaking up British Gas look weak
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The likelihood is growing that Mr Michael Heseltine, UK trade and industry
secretary, will reject the recent recommendations of the Monopolies and
Mergers Commission to break up British Gas.
Although the public consultation period still has a month to run, the
economic case for adopting them is beginning to look weak and, possibly more
important, politically unattractive. Moreover, some of Mr Heseltine's own
staff appear to disagree with the measures proposed by the commis-sion.
The 1,000-page report, published last month, recommended a nine-year
timetable for ending British Gas's dominance of the UK gas industry. It
concluded that British Gas's dual role as owner of the gas pipeline network
and supplier to the vast majority of consumers made true competition
impossible. So the commission called for the divestment by British Gas of
its trading activities by March 31 1997. It went on to recommend that
British Gas's monopoly of the market for domestic customers be abolished in
the period 2000-2002.
The problem with this timetable from Mr Heseltine's point of view is
twofold.
First, it postpones the move to free competition in the domestic market  - a
key government objective - until the end of this decade, at the earliest.
That is a long time to put off the benefits of lower prices and better
service which the government hopes greater competition will bring. Mr
Heseltine also needs to have something to offset the unpopular introduction
of value-added tax on home fuels at the end of this year.
Second, it gives priority to breaking up British Gas, which has never been
high on the government's list. In their evidence to the commission,
officials at the Department of Trade and Industry's oil and gas division
said that the question of who owned trading and transportation systems was
less important than promoting competition; ownership issues might even
recede once a free market opened up. They also pointed out the difficulties
of breaking up a company as large as British Gas (which would be the largest
corporate dismemberment seen in the UK).
Other details in the report would also present the government with problems,
for example the recommendation that the cost of splitting British Gas up be
passed on to the consumer rather than the shareholder, and the fact that
nowhere in the world has the break-up of an integrated gas monopoly been
attem-pted.
It is hard to see that Mr Heseltine is under any pressure to split up
British Gas at this juncture. Even Sir James McKinnon, the gas industry
regulator who was one of the early champions of dismemberment, seems to have
changed his tune, or at least softened it. He now believes that break-up is
less important than creating a competitive market for new suppliers to
enter, and he believes that this is what government and regulator should
concentrate on. The problem of British Gas's internal conflicts could be
satisfactorily dealt with by building 'Chinese walls' between the
transportation and trading divisions, he believes. 'The principle of
separation has been accepted,' he says.
Nor are British Gas's potential competitors gunning en masse for divestment.
Earlier this year, a group of independent gas companies put forward a
blueprint for a competitive market which did not envisage breaking up
British Gas; they only proposed a clear separation of its transportation and
trading arms.
'You don't have to go to the ultimate step of breaking up British Gas at
this stage,' says Mr Peter Bryant, deputy chairman of Utilicorp, one of the
companies which helped prepare the plan. 'This means that British Gas would
be left with a lot of power, but the regulator can achieve the necessary
transparency.'
The independents have an obvious motive in wanting the DTI to go for
deregulation first rather than a break-up. They would get access to a large
new market many years earlier than envisaged in the monopolies commission's
course of action, which proposed deregulation only after the year 2000. But
if Mr Heseltine does opt for this course, he will have to confront three
issues.
The first is the risk that true competition might never develop if British
Gas was left in one piece, however forceful the regulator. The internal
separation of the transportation and trading divisions would have to be
extremely effective to convince other users of the pipeline system that
British Gas was not giving preference to its own business. Although his oil
and gas staff seem to oppose a split-up, Mr Heseltine also has a competition
department which might view such a move, like the commission, as the
cornerstone of a free market.
The second is how to protect consumer rights. Under present arrangements,
British Gas has an obligation to supply anyone who lives within a reasonable
distance of a gas main and is willing to pay. But this obligation would be
harder to enforce in a more competitive market.
Various people have put forward ideas to deal with it. Sir James proposes
that would-be public gas suppliers (PGSs) would identify the geographical
areas they wanted to serve. Provided these were not obviously intended just
to 'cherry pick' the choicest neighbourhoods, the regulator would grant a
licence which would carry the obligation to supply all-comers in that area.
But even this arrangement runs the risk that a new PGS might fail, leaving
its customers in the lurch and the sensitive gas system out of balance.
Mr Jonathan Stern of Gas Strategies, a consultancy, believes that British
Gas would have to retain some kind of 'back-stop' role to guarantee the
supply and keep the system in balance. But British Gas would be most
reluctant to assume these responsibilities unless it was clearly compensated
for the additional cost. 'The biggest barrier facing the government is the
obligation to supply,' says Mr Stern.
The third point is prices. Would a free market really mean lower gas bills
for household consumers? British Gas has argued that 12m of its customers
are subsidised by the other 6m. This means that the 12m could actually end
up paying more as competition erodes the subsidy. The independent gas
suppliers are aware of the sensitivity of British Gas's claims, and they can
be expected to intensify their lobbying to reassure government that they are
wrong. They could point, for example, to the industrial gas market where new
competitors are charging as much as 15 per cent less than British Gas.
However, while the gas market presents complex technical issues, Mr
Heseltine's choice will ultimately be the political one of what garners the
most votes, though he would have to have good reasons for rejecting the
commission's recommendations. There can be little political mileage in
putting a priority on breaking British Gas up, but there may be votes in
stimulating competition to bring down prices for the domestic gas consumer -
though even this is questionable given the concern that consumer groups have
expressed about the impact of privatisation on utility prices.
But Mr Heseltine does have the option of opening up the market to
competition, using British Gas as a safety net for what would be a
pioneering move by world standards. This would have the additional advantage
of leaving the government with the option of breaking British Gas up at a
later stage if the experiment showed it to be necessary. This might also
give British Gas the incentive to ensure the experiment's success.

mornings

   From J H M COCKAYNE

<TEXT>
Sir, Why should the lives of millions of us be inconvenienced for the sake
of (at most) a few thousand businessmen who can't be bothered to get to work
an hour earlier (or have a sandwich lunch at their desks)? Their
counterparts in the US cope quite happily with five different time zones. So
Europe ought to be able to manage with just two.
And please let us hear no more of the other spurious argument that was
trotted out last time round: you state in your leader ('Times a-changing',
September 24) that the government will rely on evidence that 'lighter
evenings mean fewer traffic accidents'. Fewer accidents in the evenings,
perhaps - but what about darker mornings, and the corresponding increase in
accidents on the way to work or school?
Anyone who remembers those depressing dark winter mornings during the
year-long 1970s experiment will surely not wish to suffer a permanent switch
to a regime which, after having been given a fair trial, was then soundly
rejected.

FT  29 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: Milk prices best set in the market
place
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ANDREW DARE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your leading article on the forthcoming reform of the milk marketing
system ('Milking the milk monopoly', September 27) calls for a reply. The
main thrust of your argument is that the current statutory and regulated
system for the sale and purchase of raw milk and its replacement by free
market system will inevitably cause prices to rise.
To this, I would make the following points. First, if you believe in free
markets, you certainly should be giving two if not three cheers in support
of the new system. It may be that supply is limited by EC-imposed milk
quotas. But far better that the limited supply is priced by the market
place. At present, pricing and allocation of raw milk are agreed by the
buyers and sellers of milk in committee.
Under the new system, the price of milk will be decided in the market place
where dairy processors will compete with each other in terms of price and
supply of milk. That's not my idea of a monopoly.
I also take issue with the underlying assumption of your article that, if
there were a rise in the price of raw milk, it would inevitably mean a rise
in the price to the final consumer. The customers of raw milk are dairy
companies and processors. The level of their efficiency is vital in
determining the price they charge supermarkets. For example, butter
factories in Holland operate at 80 per cent capacity and so are able to
provide good prices for farmers and charge fair prices to consumers.
In the UK, such factories utilise only 25 per cent of their capacity. Surely
there is a moral here.

FT  29 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: Missed opportunity in new SE Yellow
Book
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr A DAWSON PAUL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The Stock Exchange's new Yellow Book has finally gone some way to
address the scandal of excessive compensation for directors of unsuccessful
companies ('Directors face tough SE rules', September 17). However, for most
shareholders, it is unlikely to be a practical proposition to make a journey
to inspect the relevant documents at the company's office or even during the
15 minutes before, and during, the annual general meeting, at which they
have to be on display.
What a pity that the Stock Exchange missed the opportunity to require listed
companies to set out the details of service contracts and other incentives
in the company's annual report and accounts, thus making the information
readily available to all shareholders. If the scandals continue, this
requirement should surely feature as an item to be considered when the
working of the new Yellow Book is reviewed.
In the meantime, it will be interesting to see what use the institutions
make of the additional information now available to them.

FT  29 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: US public backs nuclear energy option
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Ms ANN S BISCONTI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, David Lascelles's article, 'Cold comfort in future' (September 14)
clearly fits the old paradigm of looking at nuclear power, which holds that,
if it weren't for the public's lack of support, nuclear energy would be
considered a viable energy resource for the future.
As the person responsible for public opinion research for the US nuclear
power industry, I believe that the large body of research supports a 'new
paradigm', which better fits the public's attitudes towards nuclear energy.
This new view allows for more choices: people might think of nuclear energy
as dangerous, but they also believe that nuclear plants are safe. They might
prefer solar energy, but they want nuclear energy to be one of their
options.
People view energy sources as complementary, not as competitors. More than
two-thirds of Americans think the US should be developing both nuclear
energy and solar for future energy needs, and three-quarters believe in
keeping the option open to build new nuclear energy plants. Public concern
for clean air and new public awareness of nuclear energy's clean air
benefits are increasing the appeal of this energy source as part of the mix.
When the need for new electricity-generating plants becomes clear, nuclear
energy may not be the first choice of all communities. But the public
opinion climate that exists today would allow nuclear energy to be at the
table for consideration on its own merits.

FT  29 SEP 93 / Arts: 'The Vampyr' strikes a winning vein - The Prix Italia
Television Festival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER DUNKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Prix Italia almost died this year. Admittedly, at 45 it is astoundingly
long in the tooth for a broadcasting festival, but it deserves to live and,
if television is to be anything more than a gadget for funnelling
advertising income into global media conglomerates, we must keep fighting
for its survival. The winners of the three main awards for television this
year were the Dutch drama I Am Going To Tahiti; a 'home video' about Aids
from the US, Silverlake Life, which won the documentary category; and
Britain's so-called 'soap opera' The Vampyr, which won the music and arts
prize.
Between them they provide a vivid illustration of the sort of thing the Prix
Italia has stood for since its creation as a radio festival in 1948. The
people who come to this festival to bring their programmes, or serve on the
juries are not marketing experts: they have not come to sell programmes as
have most of the people who attend other broadcasting festivals.
When you meet them in the bar, or under the umbrella pines that seem to
surround most of the beautiful venues chosen over the years for this event,
virtually all admit that they work in television because they believe it can
be more than a medium for screening game shows and commercials. The Prix
Italia has never concerned itself with quizzes, news, sport, variety, soap
opera, movies or light entertainment. Its categories have always been drama,
music and arts, and documentary, and the programme makers who come to
compete, adjudicate and talk (oh the talk]) believe passionately that - just
as much as theatre or cinema, print or paint - television can serve as a
medium for the expression of opinion, politics, and the arts. They are
people who, in another age, would have been writing pamphlets or, earlier,
leading bands of strolling players.
The winning Dutch drama told economically, tautly, and with a quietness
unusual for such a subject, of the SS visiting the studio of artist/painter
Hendrik Werkman in early 1945. No one said 'Ve haf vays of making you talk',
this was a meeting between a complicated artist and a softly spoken
totalitarian bureaucrat. Written by Ger Beukenkamp and directed by Gerrard
Verhage it was all the more powerful for showing Werkman not as a heroic
member of the Resistance (there was a tedious French drama along those
lines, with the old cliche of betrayal under torture, heavily signalled in
the first five minutes, then spun out prettily for a further 85) but as a
pragmatist who even refused to use his printing skills to help the
Resistance. Yet the senseless killing of this man, beside a pit on the edge
of a forest, and his last request to look around for a moment before he
died, was more moving than all the familiar footage of Auschwitz railway
lines and Auschwitz ovens rammed into ITV's arts entry, The Symphony Of
Sorrowful Songs, a South Bank Show on Henryk Gorecki and his third symphony.
The 'American' documentary Silverlake Life (which would never have been made
had Channel 4 not commissioned it and put up the seed money, according to
its producer) is a home video shot by Tom Joslin and Mark Massi as Aids
destroyed their health and eventually caused Joslin's death. At nearly two
hours it is demandingly long and, some would say, flawed by its lack of any
sense of modesty, a characteristic apparently seen as a virtue in modern
America. Yet it is undeniably moving.
The BBC's winning entry in the music and arts category, The Vampyr, is an
extraordinary conflation of grand opera and television soap opera. A 19th
century work by Heinrich Marschner was rewritten as a horror film screenplay
by Janet Street-Porter and Nigel Finch, and directed by Finch in brief
episodes that were screened in Britain on successive days last Christmas. At
this festival we saw a single 46 minute episode which worked slightly less
well, but still deservedly took the top prize.
So what does all this illustrate? First, a determination that we shall not
forget the holocaust, and a belief that television can and must bear witness
to it. In the 20 odd years that I have been attending the Prix Italia no one
has ever attacked television for screening game shows or soap operas but I
have lost count of the number who have, metaphorically and sometimes
literally, cornered me to insist that, whatever else it does, television
must sustain the memory of this key event in 20th century European history.
Somehow I doubt that you hear the same sentiment expressed too often in the
offices of Global Satellite TV Inc.
Though paramount, the holocaust is not the only subject of its sort: Prix
Italia entries have dealt with genocide in Cambodia, and this year there was
a noticeable increase in the number or programmes concerned with the
idiocies and cruelty of eastern Europe's late communist regimes. The Czechs
entered a drama, A Chateau In Bohemia, which came close to glorifying the
spirit and standards of the old aristocracy, as personified by a doughty
countess during the darkest days of the 1950s, and a somewhat chaotic - yet
brief and amusing - documentary about political protest in Moscow today.
Secondly, the closely connected determination that television shall document
the great social factors of our own time. Over the years this has included
the ageing of the western European population and the problems inherent in
nuclear fission. These days it includes child sex abuse (this year's
Canadian entry, The Boys Of St Vincent, illustrated this with a gripping
drama typical of North American professionalism) and the emergence of
third-world mega cities as global centres of industrial manufacturing, a
subject superbly covered by the Danish entry, Battle Of The Titans. Above
all there is now Aids, a subject treated by television with far more
compassion than it has received in the press, though less objectivity,
perhaps - an approach typified by Silverlake Life.
Thirdly there is the conviction that television can and should be used for
conveying works of art - plays, operas, ballets - to big audiences (La Sept
of France gave us Kurt Weill's Seven Deadly Sins . . . again: what is this
fixation exerted by the monotonous work of Weill over European
intellectuals?); for exploring their construction (Denmark's Giselle used
rehearsals by the Royal Danish Ballet to speak volumes about the process of
dance); and to renew and popularise existing or forgotten material, a
purpose achieved with extraordinary effectiveness by the BBC's Vampyr.
One of the dangers of championing the Prix Italia if you are British is the
suspicion that you are doing so because Britain has been uniquely successful
at this event. Since 1959 when television programmes were introduced, 33 of
the top prizes have been awarded to UK broadcasters. The second most
successful nation has been France with 13, third is Sweden with 10, and
equal fourth with seven each are Japan and the US. There are not many areas
in which postwar Britain can claim to have been nearly five times as
successful as Japan and the US but television programming - if you accept
the judgment of the international juries at this, the most keenly contested
of broadcasting festivals - is one. So there is a danger of hubris.
But as so much of European television turns, with frightening rapidity, into
a clone of its counterpart in the US, where commerce is all and ratings are
the only criterion, we should risk accusations of special pleading and do
all we can to encourage RAI, Italy's equivalent of the BBC, to keep the Prix
Italia going. This year they put it on a life support system, holding the
event at their own concert hall in Rome instead of the usual exotic resort.
At a dinner held by Britain's independent broadcasters the retiring
secretary-general, Piergiorgio Branzi, promised that the event would now go
on, and members of the secretariat bravely declare that it has been saved
'forever'.
Yet the recession and Italy's fraught politics show few signs of abating.
Most dangerous of all is the attitude of philistine politicians, in all
countries, who argue that public service broadcasters such as RAI and the
BBC should merely fill in the gaps where satellite and cable operators
cannot make a profit. It is the attitude of the showbiz huckster that the
Prix Italia exists to resist. Today that resistance is more rare and vital
than ever.

FT  29 SEP 93 / Arts: Strauss's 'Daphne' - Opera in concert
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There was a time when Richard Strauss's 1938 Daphne was thought safest on
the concert platform. Not only because it was an unfamiliar opera in one
longish act, and thus a risky bet for expensive staging; but also because at
the end the carolling heroine must turn into a (wordless) laurel tree.
Since designers nowadays have cleverer technology at their disposal, that is
no longer the dismaying hurdle it used to seem. Furthermore, many
music-lovers have by now seen Daphne staged: by Opera North, or in almost
any German house and many French ones, though never yet in London. The
experience proves how much easier it is in an orchestra pit to keep
Strauss's band down to its intended pastoral-lyrical level. In the Royal
Festival Hall on Monday, Andrew Davis found that hard to manage with the BBC
Symphony. Too many orchestral voices vied for our attention; too many
interesting ripples, too little serene flow.
For all that, it was a sound, graceful performance, and had it not been so
decisively outclassed a couple of years ago by Norman del Mar and the
Chelsea Opera Group in the Queen Elizabeth Hall (semi-professional
orchestra, mostly younger and less experienced singers) one might have
warmed to it more. If the two performances were not fairly comparable, given
their different circumstances, they certainly afforded different
experiences. In the larger hall the BBC version - the opening shot in their
'Strauss/Stravinsky Season' - exerted no spell, tamed the much-needed
ruderies of the shepherds' music, never lit up Strauss's magical pianissimi.
Another Daphne might have inspired them more. Janice Watson's fresh,
attractive soprano is more distinguished for energy than for long, floated
lines or liquid legato, which are the prerequisites for her fey,
other-worldly role. Besides, though she took its taxing high range nicely in
her stride she made very little of her words. Among all his rapturous
soprano monologues, there is not one that bears singing 'just for the
tunes'.
Josef Gregor's stiff libretto gives us a timorous adolescent Daphne, beset
not only by an impractical yen for union with plants and trees - rather
than, say, men - but by competing tenors. Young Jon Fredric West sang the
masterful god Apollo with high efficiency, and even conveyed some vital
feeling. Like his compatriots Jess Thomas and James King before him, West is
a specialist in Strauss's strenuous, somewhat thankless Heldentenor parts. A
brighter ring in the voice would have enlivened this one; perhaps he was
jet-lagged. As Leukippos, Daphne's greenstick swain from childhood, Vinson
Cole was as usual faultlessly musical, transparent and affecting. Why do we
hear so little of this excellent artist in Britain?
The only other halfway-decent roles in the piece are Daphne's parents,
Peneios and Gaea. Peneios, seriously under-composed and under-dramatised,
needs at least to wield a grave, imposing bass; for all David
Wilson-Johnson's virtues, he had no such thing in his kit. In Gaea's
strangely quiet, withheld music - which goes down to an unheard-of and
possibly unheard E-flat - Jadwiga Rappe found a more penetrating note. The
marginal parts, shepherds and maids, were cast from strength. What we heard
was nevertheless a sum of uneven parts.

Plaid, to borrow from the Oxford English Dictionary, is 'a long piece of
twilled woollen cloth, usually having a chequered or tartan pattern, forming
the outer article of the Highland costume'. That is distinct from the
Lowland plaid, which has a different pattern and is more commonly known as a
maud. Americans are very fond of the Highland version.
In the delightful musical entertainment that has opened at the Apollo, plaid
is pronounced to rhyme with glad.
Do not be misled by the bagpiper outside the theatre. Forever Plaid takes
its name from a fictitious four guy harmony group of the kind that was
immensely popular, especially in the US, in the 1950s. The story is that
their kind of music was killed off by the arrival of the Beatles. Unlike
Buddy Holly, Forever Plaid didn't even have a plane crash: they died in a
road accident while still rehearsing. Now they come back from heaven.
And heaven in a way it is. These are fresh-faced American guys, with short
hair and intelligent looks. It is about as far from Grease or Hair as a
musical can get. When not wearing plaid, they tend to wear elegant white
dinner jackets: sometimes a mixture of the two. It is not hard to imagine
them in high society, whether the movie or the real thing.
There is a certain amount of dialogue and knock-about. For the most part,
however, they simply sing the 1950s songs of innocence in their harmonised
style. At one stage,they adapt the Beatles' 'She Loves Me', and you know
that can't be bad. They have a wonderful time with 'Lady of Spain', bring in
the audience when it comes to the mambo and show their more emotional range
in their version of 'Cry'.
Some will settle simply for the sheer nostalgic pleasure of their
arrangements of 'Three Coins in the Fountain' and 'Catch a Falling Star',
though they can have deeper voices when they want to, as in 'Sixteen Tons'.
Plaid lasts for less than two hours without an interval, is directed by
Stuart Ross, and has a splendid pianist in James Compton. If you want a
really good-natured show that you cannot fail to enjoy, here it is.

FT  29 SEP 93 / Arts: Cat on a Hot Tin Roof - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ST GEORGE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Birmingham Stage Company at the reopened Old Rep Theatre has staged a
fine production of Cat on a Hot Tin Roof for its first birthday. The Old Rep
will soon be enjoying the same success as the folks up at the New Rep.
The Old Rep is a middle-sized traditionally shaped theatre from 1913,
England's first specifically designed repertory. Tennessee Williams
(1911-1983) was barely talking then, but he has made up for it with this
wordy play, a companion to Streetcar (1947) and The Night of the Iguana
(1961). Williams changed the ending for the Broadway director, Elia Kazan:
'I was fearful that I would lose his interest if I didn't re-examine the
script from his point of view' he wrote coyly about rewriting in 1955. But
the Birmingham director Graeme Messer opts for the original unaltered
version.
Cat on a Hot Tin Roof is quintessential Williams; it has heat,
claustrophobia, lusty and vigorous characters at odds with life, and plenty
of bourbon. Maggie and Brick are stuck in a sexless marriage, she is lithe
and sexy, while he is uninterested and alcoholic. The action runs throughout
one evening on the family plantation where Brick's father, the old patriarch
Big Daddy, is dying of cancer. Who will get the 28,000 acres of fertile
Delta land when Big Daddy dies?
It takes alchemy to make steamy Mississippi from a wet night in Birmingham.
Only the cicadas are missing. The simple set catches the feel of the
plantation and Williams' wonderful stage informality. 'Anything else I can
think of? Ah yes, fanlights,' he writes in his stage directions.
The acting is patchy, but there are three highlights. Sandra Reinton as
Maggie makes a very fine professional debut: she has poise, presence and an
ability to make the passion believable. Opposite her, Marcus D'Amico as
Brick plays the cool husband who turns marriage into a test of will and life
into a battle with the bottle. He manages to pitch this difficult character
exactly, part honest, part feckless, wholly drunk. Big Daddy (Burl Ives in
the Broadway premiere) is well played by Barry Stanton, by turns passionate
and sentimental: 'Hold on to your life. There's nothing else to hold on to.'
The brilliance of Williams is his ability to create tension out of loosely
paced action and the easy drawl of his characters. If the direction here
were more relaxed, the play would benefit.

FT  29 SEP 93 / Arts: 'Cosi' in a sharp new light - Music Theatre London's
latest production
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Dorabella lifts her face from her paperback (Raw Energy) and says 'I'm
totally energised]' She and Fiordiligi are waiting outside the electrically
fenced MOD enclosure. Where can their RAF lovers, Ferrando and Guglielmo,
be? Then they hear that the boyfriends are being sent straight into action
today. (Chorus: 'Onward and upwards to victory]') Meeting in a quick but
tearful farewell ('. . . life's a bitch and then you die'), the girls beg
the men 'You must be sure to 'phone'. But soon two rich American strangers
(F. and G. in disguise) enter the girls' lives, announcing 'We're hung like
two sun-ripe bananas' . . .
Music Theatre London has its own style, which in recent years has had
notable success in Mozart's Figaro and Don Giovanni and Rossini's
Cinderella. The performers are actors who can also sing; recitatives are
spoken; and everything - locale and words - is transposed into present-day
England. This method has made us see the societies of old operas by a newly
sharp light, while laughing at the England we know.
Now MTL is tackling Cos fan tutte. Despina is a neighbour who pops in to
borrow some sugar, and Dorabella stuffs herself neurotically with chocolate
biscuits as her first aria ends.
Cos, however, faces MTL with a new kind of problem, because it is less to do
with sociological structure than Figaro, Giovanni and Cinderella. Class
tensions are virtually absent from Cos, whose subject - women's capacity for
infidelity, and men's reactions to that - is developed in private. Another
problem here is the fact that the usual MTL director, Nick Broadhurst, was
unable to shape the entire show; William Relton is billed as 'co-director'.
In consequence, this Cos only fitfully displays the impish, revelatory
modern detail that kept bubbling up through the company's previous work.
Yet, although this staging is not always neat or satisfying, it addresses
the core of Cos seriously - and so proves often stimulating, often
entertaining. Its strengths and weaknesses of this Cos are best illustrated
by its Ferrando, Simon Butteriss (an MTL regular). Ferrando, Cos's least
defined character, is appalled when he finds that Dorabella has betrayed him
 -yet, trying to seduce Fiordiligi only minutes later, he becomes
(musically) so impassioned that we wonder if he has transferred affection.
In this case, we don't wonder any more - we know.
Butteriss keeps forcing us to attend to the workings of Ferrando's heart
when Mozart leaves us (and Ferrando) ambiguous. This helps us to re-think
Ferrando, but not always to believe simply that he is Ferrando. No-one
onstage is more vividly alive to every nuance, more exemplary in dramatic
commitment, but he actually works too hard. To cope with the role's rigorous
lines, he has, you can hear, acquired newly lyrical and heroic vocal tones -
enlarging his usually incisive, but strenuous and tight, vocal method. (He
has already this year played Mozart's Marcellina, Masetto and Basilio -
quite a gamut.) These new 'Ferrando' tones, however, are not unified; you
can hear him changing tack vocally.
Fiordiligi (Jacinta Mulcahy), Dorabella (Mary Lincoln), and Guglielmo (Peter
Corry) - all vocally more relaxed - give sensitive, accomplished
performances that are intermittently exciting. Fiordiligi gets visibly high
on the defiant proclamations of fidelity in her first aria; and Dorabella's
giggly second aria (here sung in a drunken lather) exposes her own
unresisting emotional helplessness. Both girls are brunette beauties. But,
despite several such illuminating passages, they lack force of character, so
that sometimes we feel what certain opponents of Cos have claimed: that
these people are fools.
The two most completely conceived characters are Alfonso (Richard Hampton)
and Despina (Marilyn Cutts). Hampton's delivery, however, is laborious and
grey, whereas the tension whooshes up with Cutts's every entrance. She sings
and acts this nosy, knowing neighbour with easy assurance. Tony Britten,
leading the band of five, gives the show the right brisk pulse. The
ensembles, as they should, danced. The show's tone is not consistent, but it
adds to our understanding of this most imponderable opera.

There can be only one choice tonight for Morse addicts who in Inspector
Morse (C4, 8.30) are offered their last sighting of Oxford's most famous
fictional inhabitant - last, that is to say, until the next season of
repeats comes round to lighten our screens. Strangely enough, our farewell
to the mild-mannered introspective will not be taking place against a
backdrop of college quadrangles but in the brisker air of the Australian
outback.
It seems feeble that they could not have come up with another title for
tonight's Timewatch; The Mother of All Battles (BBC2, 8.00). That was a
great phrase when it fell from the lips of Saddam Hussein, redolent of a
particular time, place, and culture. Now it has become just another boring
journalistic cliche. The programme describes the course of what was the
greatest armoured battle in history, the Battle of Kursk in the Ukraine.
The Late Show (BBC 2, 11.15), looks at another battle, to save the soul of
Croydon, one of the south-east's least appreciated towns. A group of
architects are invited to explain what they would do to make Croydon lovely.

FT  29 SEP 93 / Business and the Environment: United colours of Pelourinho -
A Brazilian city's historic but decaying centre has been saved in a
pioneering project
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINA LAMB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pelourinho, the name of an area in the centre of the north-eastern Brazilian
city of Salvador, means 'pillory' and in colonial times it was a place of
horror for slaves taken there to be thrashed. In modern, more egalitarian,
times Pelourinho became a place of danger for everyone, its crumbling
buildings and crime-infested alleys presenting the unsuspecting visitor with
the equal likelihood of being knifed or hit by falling masonry. By 1991, the
area was completely derelict, with 30 buildings collapsing each year.
But during the past two years, Pelourinho, described by Unesco as the most
important collection of baroque colonial architecture in the Americas, has
been restored to its 16th, 17th and 18th century splendour. The
transformation, the largest restoration project ever carried out in Brazil,
is the work of an enlightened local government which decided to rescue its
history before it was too late.
The Pelourinho project has yielded spectacular results in architectural,
cultural and economic terms. The vibrant pinks, yellows and blues of its
restored houses, churches and museums with stunning collections of sacred
art, are now drawing tourists and historians from all over the globe,
pushing Salvador from the eighth to the second most popular tourist
destination in Brazil.
As a result, the area, which three centuries ago was the commercial centre
of Salvador, has a thriving economy. The government has rented most of the
104 buildings restored so far to shops, bars and hotels. It has also
stimulated local culture by encouraging artists, dancers and musicians to
keep the area's bohemian character and African heritage.
The achievement is particularly impressive in a country where preservation
usually means abandonment and which, despite its minimal amount of heritage,
has no tradition of restoration.
When Pelourinho was declared a historic monument by Unesco in 1984 it was in
an advanced stage of rot. A few state governors had made half-hearted
attempts at restoration, but the work was not maintained by their successors
and the area had become a refuge of criminals, prostitutes and other low
life. Vivaldo Costa Lima, head of the Institute of Artistic and Cultural
Heritage (Ipac), says: 'It had become a place you visited with fear.'
But in 1991, Antonio Carlos Magalhaes became state governor for the third
time and decided that if Pelourinho was to be restored, it was now or never.
He says: 'I'd loved Pelourinho ever since I was mayor of Salvador and in my
first two governments I did a little, but was unsuccessful in getting
private and international support. In the end, I decided to allocate the
state's own funds. It's the most important Portugese baroque architecture
anywhere in the world and I wanted to give it back to the city.'
Last year, he set Ipac to work on four of the most decayed blocks and
already nearly 250 houses have been restored at a cost to date of Dollars
15m (Pounds 9.7m) - the final total for 600 buildings will be Dollars 40m.
Costa Lima says: 'Our mandate was to recuperate the houses and devolve them
to the economic and global life of the city without taking away their
character. The real priority was to preserve our history - stimulating
tourism was a lucky byproduct.'
It was not an easy task. The degradation of the buildings meant they were
inhabited mostly by squatters, who did not care for them, thus worsening
their decline. Poor wiring and clandestine electricity connections led to 20
fires in the past two years. Many had been divided and subdivided to shelter
hundreds of families, causing structural damage. One house was home to 154
people.
For the project to get under way, the inhabitants had to be moved out. Last
November, the government removed 434 families, spending Dollars 500,000 in
compensation, to enable them to rent cheap accommodation elsewhere. In the
beginning, there was plenty of opposition, so Ipac hired a sociologist,
Luciano Diniz Borges, to mount an educational project to explain to
residents that restoration would mean a better standard of living and the
chance of work. Today, just one legal case is pending.
The government either bought the few houses that were still in private hands
or did a deal whereby people with two houses gave one to the government and
got both restored or owners of just one house gave one floor to the
government.
Before restoration began, the state water and power companies installed
underground sewage and power cables. A battery of architects and historians
set to work, led by Adriana Castro and Etelvina Reboucas Fernandes, two
architects who both say the Pelourinho project is the most exciting
assignment they have ever had.
The first block of 104 buildings - approximately a tenth of the total area -
was the most degraded as well as that with the greatest concentration of
works of art. Fernandes says: 'Some areas were so run down, that if they
hadn't been restored then they would have been completely lost.'
One third of the first 104 houses had to be completely reconstructed.
Initially, restoration was carried out house by house, but the group soon
found it was no good restoring one house when next door there was a fire
risk, piles of rubbish or danger of collapse, so now the work is done in
blocks.
Traditional materials were used where possible, but the area has a serious
woodworm problem because of high humidity. To support rotting structures,
metal and reinforced concrete with plaster casing were necessary.
As the workers peeled away centuries of paint and plaster, they made
important discoveries. There was no buried gold, but they found stunning
wooden ceilings, painted ceilings and blue and white porcelain tiles. At
number 2 Francisco Muniz Barreto street, they found railings, balconies,
pulpits and tiles all completely covered by successive plastering. The
locals are spiritual people and the workmen were terrified when they
uncovered a huge hole in one house, convinced that devils would jump out.
Researchers thumbed through thousands of documents to find what the houses
had been like, and used chemical tests to detect their original colours.
Many visitors are surprised by the vibrant colours, but Costa Lima says that
is exactly how they were two centuries ago: 'We found that the paints had
all been imported from Europe - they must have been the pigments available
at the time.'
Once the first block was completed, the government started renting out the
buildings. To preserve the area's character some old institutions were
maintained, such as the Bar do Reggae, the house of Jorge Amado, Brazil's
best known writer, and the Filhos de Gandhi, a local African-inspired dance
group. Costa Lima says: 'To keep the local spirit we have allowed popular
bars, cheap restaurants and barbers, but we couldn't have a paternalistic
attitude. If artists have a public, then they can afford to rent at
commercial rates.'
To improve access on the narrow cobbled streets, as well as reduce
pollution, underground carparks are being built. Ipac hopes eventually to
ban all traffic. A special battalion of military police has been created for
the area to dispel its old reputation of violence.
The state government is using pictures of the restored area in a marketing
campaign to attract tourists to Salvador. Last month as the host city for
the Ibero-American summit, it received welcome publicity. The area is now
thronging with tourists and the museum of sacred art, which until last year
was abandoned and crumbling, now gets more visitors than any museum in
Brazil.
As a result, Borges says the local people have benefited from the project:
'We're generating lots of jobs in restaurants, bars, boutiques and hotels -
already more than 300, aside from those involved in the restoration - that's
far better than just giving bowls of soup.'

FT  29 SEP 93 / Business and the Environment: Accounting for 'green' efforts
 -Ian Rodger scrutinises Ciba's new environmental report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Big companies, especially big chemical companies, are constantly searching
for new ways to allay deep-seated public suspicions about the damage their
operations do to the environment.
Most now devote large sections of their annual report and accounts to
descriptions of their environmental protection activities in addition to
other published brochures and data.
Ciba, the huge Swiss chemicals and pharmaceuticals group, is well known for
its efforts in this sensitive area.
It has just gone a step further, publishing what it calls a 'Corporate
Environmental Report 1992'.
Clearly modelled on the typical annual financial report, the 28-page glossy
brochure provides a combination of statements of policy from the chairman
and chief executive, detailed descriptions of progress achieved during the
past year and several pages of statistical data with helpful explanations of
their meaning.
The report will be published regularly, and possibly annually like the
group's financial report, although Ciba says only that 'it will be updated
regularly'.
It is published in German and English, is well written and illustrated, and
will undoubtedly be useful as a handout to concerned shareholders, employees
and various interested groups in the communities where Ciba has operations.
The first section of the report, setting out Ciba's environmental policies,
is particularly clear and the group's goal, sustainable development, is
particularly well explained.
'We must help meet the needs of today without compromising the ability of
future generations to meet their own needs,' Ciba says.
On the whole, however, the report is less than satisfying. The items in the
descriptive section, perhaps necessarily, are repetitive variations on a
theme. One describes how Ciba has improved its use of resources in
Argentina, another how it virtually eliminated waste water at Toms River,
New Jersey, another how it developed a new process to recover waste at a
chemical plant in Spain, and so on.
The result is a report with a slightly surreal 1950s optimism - everything
is getting better and better every day in every way.
Ciba's editors may have sensed this. A section entitled 'Incidents'
describes soberly the group's two plant accidents that occurred last year,
one at Grimsby in the UK and one at Schweizerhalle in Switzerland, and
explains their causes and effects.
There is also a startlingly punchy question and answer section with the
group's environmental directors. Sample question: 'Ciba had to pay Dollars
9m (Pounds 5.8m) in fines and penalties in the US for violations of waste
disposal regulations at your Toms River site in New Jersey. How does this
accord with your commitment towards complying with the law?'
The answer regrettably was much less punchy than the question.
The statistical section likewise has a slightly off-beat quality.
Unlike corporate financial reports, where one is accustomed to viewing
charts where the bars march confidently upward to the right, here we are
invited to take some comfort from seeing the charts all march smartly
downwards.
Water and CFC usage, emissions of nitrogen oxides, sulphur dioxide
emissions, discharges into the river Rhine - have all declined over the past
three years.
A few indicators are still rising, such as energy consumption and carbon
dioxide emissions, and the explanations provided point to an inevitable
paradox in the group's efforts to lessen environmental impacts of industrial
activity.
'The rise in carbon dioxide emissions is mainly due to our growing use of
waste to produce energy through our own incinerators . . . A further reason
is the increased energy requirements of air pollution control equipment.'

FT  29 SEP 93 / People: UES Holdings to do without chief executive
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Graham Mackenzie, chief executive of UES Holdings, is leaving the
Rotherham-based company following a reorganisation intended to give greater
autonomy to the three operating divisions - steels, forgings and
subsidiaries.
The surprise announcement, which takes effect immediately, is a result of
the amalgamation of the company's executive committee into the board
structure - a move inspired by British Steel, which owns 60.9 per cent of
UES Holdings, and GKN which owns the remaining 39.1 per cent.
It leaves UES in the unusual position of operating without a chief
executive. The company said yesterday that, in view of current market
conditions, the flatter management structure would better enable it to cut
costs and improve profits, and provide a more direct interface between the
UES businesses and the two shareholders.
UES stressed that there had been no boardroom row, and that Mackenzie, who
was made chief executive in 1990, was leaving by mutual agreement.
UES, formerly known as United Engineering Steels, says that Don Ford, 64,
who was appointed chairman last year, will devote more time to the company's
affairs. Ford, a former British Steel executive, is also chairman of Twil,
the wire rope joint venture between British Steel and Bekaert of Belgium.
David Stone, managing director of the steels division, and John Dawson,
managing director of the forgings division, have been appointed to the UES
Holdings board.
Yesterday's announcement comes less than a week after UES revealed plans to
close the smallest of its three steelmaking plants, at Templeborough in
Rotherham.
Separately, GKN says the cost for UES of the proposed closure would not be
significant. GKN's share of the exceptional charge this year would not
exceed Pounds 10m.

<TEXT>
Lord Kingsdown, the recently ennobled Robin Leigh-Pemberton who retired as
governor of the Bank of England four months ago, is not settling back to
life as a gentleman farmer.
In addition to a directorship at Glaxo, Lord Kingsdown has accepted an
invitation to join the board of HAMBROS, the merchant bank, as a
non-executive director.
How much of a distraction from more gentlemanly pursuits the task will prove
remains to be seen, but with his own secretary and office at his disposal,
he may feel obliged to make fairly regular appearances. 'We look forward to
him contributing in many areas to all the work we will be doing,' says Sir
Adam Ridley, Hambros' PR director.
Lord Kingsdown will take up his appointment, approved at a Hambros board
meeting yesterday, on November 1. His appointment brings the number of
non-executive directors at Hambros to four.

FT  29 SEP 93 / People: Pattisson's long-standing relationship with Allders
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Allders, the department store and duty free retail group which is planning a
flotation in the next few weeks, has appointed John Pattisson as a
non-executive director.
Pattisson has a long-standing relationship with the retailer - expected to
be capitalised at around Pounds 150m - since he was an executive director of
Hanson from which Allders' management bought the business in 1989. Hanson
acquired Allders as part of its purchase of UDS in 1983.
Harvey Lipsith, Allders' chief executive, says that Pattisson's experience
as a public company director and his 'considerable knowledge of working in
the City' would be helpful to Allders, as well as his knowledge of the
company.
Pattisson's involvement with the Anglo-American conglomerate pre-dates Lord
Hanson himself since he was a director of Wiles, the fertiliser and grain
sack leasing group which later became Hanson, when Wiles first raised money
in the City in 1960. Pattisson stayed with Hanson as a non-executive
director after it went public in 1964, leaving in the early 1970s when he
worked at Dawnay Day, a small bank which was taken over by Jacob Rothschild
in 1980.
He rejoined Hanson as an executive director in 1981 and stayed for 10 years
handling merger and acquisition matters and dealing with the City. Now 62,
he is chairman of Imperial Group Pension Trust, the pension fund of Hanson's
tobacco business, and is a non-executive director of Wassall, another
conglomerate run by ex-Hanson executives, in which Hanson has a small stake.
Lipsith says Paul Brooks, one of the group's non-executive directors, who
represents one of its venture capital backers, is expected to resign at the
time of the flotation.
The chairman Lord Prior and the two other non-executives will stay.

FT  29 SEP 93 / Recruitment: The truly hard school of reality - No excuse
for teachers of management to plead there are only some aspects of it they
can teach
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL DIXON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SINCE you readers clearly like to know what's really going on, the Jobs
column naturally leapt to take up the invitation. It was to the World
Reality Seminar in Spain.
Even though the mail failed to bring the promised detailed programme, the
event's title gave me high hopes of being able to wise you up on my return.
In particular, the title seemed very relevant to my sermon last week about
the unhealthy practice of referring to workers as 'players', so glossing
over the important difference between people's real-world efforts to make a
living, and their indulgence in mere pastimes such as games.
Alas, I at first felt disappointed on reaching the event at Madrid's
international management school, the Instituto de Empresa. For when it comes
to distinguishing games-playing from essential bread-earning, academic
studies strike me as being largely on the sporting side of the divide. And
the World Reality Seminar turned out to be a part of the most academic of
the IE school's courses, for younger people studying full-time for a Master
of Business Administration.
But the disappointment soon disappeared when meetings with half a dozen of
IE's teaching staff showed that, besides sharing my view of the games-like
nature of many academic studies, they feel it conflicts with the object of
equipping each student to be a good manager in real life. They nevertheless
claimed that the conflict was less of their own making than imposed on them
by the fee-dependent IE's need to earn its real-world keep.
After all, when people are choosing which management school to attend, they
are not concerned solely with what they are likely to learn there. They also
want their choice to have a name that adds prestige to their curriculum
vitae.
That is especially important to ambitious youngsters, not long out of their
first university course, who now often aim to pursue their career worldwide.
Their hopes are improved if they have a 'passport' recognised by recruiters
outside their home country, and in the opinion of international employers
the best passport is an accredited MBA degree. And the only criterion on
which an esteemed university will award such a degree is good performance in
the intellectual games presided over by the scholarly authorities.
In sum, the issue of passports is controlled by the academic play-makers,
and for as long as employers pay high regard to the paper, it will have a
real-world value of its own. Hence no matter how much a management school's
staff may want to cut out games-playing and focus on realities, they dare
not do so.
IE's response is evidently to keep the playing to an expedient minimum.
There are very few pure theorists in the faculty, I was told, and relatively
little value is given to theoretical research in the judgment of
staff-members' worth.
Much greater weight is put on effectiveness at teaching, the prime gauge
being assessments made by students. 'We fire some professors most years,'
said academic dean Tomas Garicano. 'Teachers whose students don't learn are
a luxury we cannot afford.'
The school also relies heavily on exercises such as the reality seminar,
which concentrates on marketing and is made up of presentations by people
working in the field. Moreover, although that particular event goes on for
four whole weeks, it is far from the only occasion on which IE brings in
practising managers to tell how they do their jobs. Since the aim of
importing them is to anchor scholarship to actuality, if what they say
conflicts with the theory, so much the better.
If that seems to be no more than a common-sense approach to the topic of
management, all I can say is that it contrasts markedly with some approaches
adopted elsewhere, and not only in academic institutions. Witness the first
of a new series of columns about management just launched by Britain's
Sunday newspaper, The Observer.
Seeing the launching as a noteworthy event for the topic, I was perplexed by
a statement early in the first article, reading: '. . . although everyone
admits the legitimacy of economics (even in its most far-fetched
assumptions), management - the art of orchestrating human effort for a
common goal - rarely gets such benefit of the doubt. Management is the
invisible discipline.'
Now what took me aback was not just the bit about economics, although it
furrowed my brow more than somewhat. After all, it isn't true that 'everyone
admits the legitimacy of economics', because some people clearly take quite
the opposite stance.
Moreover, besides myself, they include even highly esteemed academics such
as the US psychologist Amos Tversky who has closely studied how people make
actual buying decisions, and found that the way they really make them
differs radically from the way in which they are assumed to do so by
economists.
But the part of the Observer's statement most likely to perplex real-life
managers even if they believe in economics, is the sentence: 'Management is
the invisible discipline.' For the fact is that few if any disciplines are
more visible than the sort actual managers work under, at least if they
operate at the sharp end of business. So readers who toil in that type of
vineyard might well be wondering what anyone could mean by calling
management 'the invisible discipline'.
If so, the only suggestion I can offer is that the quotation's last word is
used in the specific sense of an academic discipline - the system of rules
made and policed by the leading players of the particular intellectual game
in question. An example of such a discipline which is visible, of course, is
economics - which would seem to raise the question whether management can
wisely be treated as no different from economics even if only so far as the
study of it is concerned.
To the Jobs column's mind at any rate, the answer is no. True, the work of
managing entails intellectual operations, which can be particularly helpful
in the advance planning of what should be done. But according to most of the
managers I've talked to, reaching planning decisions of that kind is a
doddle compared with the task of getting the decisions implemented in some
way that usefully resembles what the planners intended. And success in
implementation clearly hinges on human faculties that academia has so far
been unable to explain, let alone to teach.
Even the unusually practical IE staff doubted that they could go beyond
teaching would-be managers to carry out rigorous analysis and then take the
initial action in line with the results. 'But how to carry things through to
a successful conclusion must largely be left to be learned by experience,'
said one. 'The best computer simulations can't cover anything like the
complexity real implementation involves.'
That, however, surely misses the main point. If implementation is the most
decisive phase of management, then it is no excuse for outfits styling
themselves schools of management to plead that implementation cannot be
taught by their academically established methods. The onus is on them to
find out how to teach it, and change their methods accordingly - if, that
is, they expect the outside world to go on funding the cost of their keep.

FT  29 SEP 93 / Management: When patience is the best policy - Mental
illness costs British business billions each year. Robert Milburn offers
advice for employers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT MILBURN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sane, the mental health charity, estimates that one in 10 people in Britain
will suffer from mental illness at some time in their life.
The cost of treating them - Pounds 3.15bn in 1991 - falls largely on the
National Health Service. But the financial consequences for employers cannot
be ignored. According to the Independent Healthcare Association, mental
illness costs British businesses Pounds 3.76bn each year in lost working
days.
Employers - many of whom offer counselling - are already aware that stress
can adversely affect productivity. The Institute of Psychiatry at the
Maudsley Hospital in London has set up Work Stress for those suffering
psychological problems. Employers pay for staff to use the service which
also provides confidential interviews with accredited clinical
psychologists.
Few companies, however, have a strategy for dealing with mentally ill
employees. The problem is that mental illness, particularly in the early
stages, is often hard to identify. Many of the early symptoms of mental
problems may be similar to those of stress, such as an inability to
concentrate or make decisions. But whereas stress can often be alleviated by
relaxation techniques or better organisation, mental problems tend to be
more acute and take longer to overcome.
Marjorie Wallace, chief executive of Sane, emphasises the need to look out
for the danger signs. 'Lots of studies show that if you catch someone early
enough, before they deteriorate, they stabilise and don't become seriously
ill, saving the community a lot of money.'
Often, employers are aware that there is something wrong, but provided the
employee's work is satisfactory, prefer not to pry. After all, there may be
a perfectly understandable reason, such as marital problems. However, should
the sufferer break down and become unable to work, companies are forced to
take action.
This often takes the form of long-term sick leave or dismissal, particularly
if an employee is acting bizarrely or admits to feeling suicidal.
It is vital, however, that managers remain calm. When told by a sales
representative that he felt suicidal, one manager expressed her fear that he
might kill himself while visiting a
client. She then warned him that she had informed the directors about his
state of mind, and that they were questioning his fitness to do the job.
What this man needed was reassurance of the company's support, not a verbal
warning.
Managers should liaise with the employee's family and doctors to devise a
strategy for coping in the short-term. For instance, the doctor might advise
that sick leave would be counter-productive. There might be a need for an
initial absence from work, but forcing a distressed person to spend a
prolonged period at home with nothing to do could make them more depressed.
Sane has begun a campaign in London which will eventually go to the rest of
the country, recruiting Helpline volunteers from big companies. They will
then be able to help colleagues at work. The Saneline number has been
advertised in BT, Unilever and National Power's staff publications.
Sane has also been campaigning to change misconceptions about mental
illness. 'Employers need to accept that mental illness is containable and
treatable,' Wallace says. Ultimately, she wants employers to accept mental
illnesses as they do other physical illnesses or disabilities.
A Sane representative said that in the past two years he had only come
across one example of a company being supportive to staff suffering from
mental illness. 'It is easy to see the employers' point of view. If they are
laying off healthy employees because of the recession, why should they give
preferential treatment to someone who may be a liability?' The potential for
damage to a company's image and revenues from a mentally-ill employee in a
responsible position is obvious.
However, from a business viewpoint, sacking a mentally ill employee can be
counter-productive. Take the example of the manager who had a good track
record, but then suffered a breakdown and began acting oddly at work. His
employer's patience rapidly wore out. The company used the excuse of a
decline in sales to make him redundant, and then sold the product range he
was responsible for to a competitor.
However, any quick profits it had hoped to make evaporated because the other
firm changed its mind. The manager's dismissal led to a loss of customer
confidence and goodwill, and it took 18 months to find another buyer at a
reduced price.
Mental illness can have many causes, but environmental factors play an
important role. For instance, conflict with other employees, unreasonable
targets or aggressive superiors can put vulnerable employees under stress.
If these problems are not remedied, other employees can also become ill.
Many mental illnesses have a natural course and eventually disappear. Even
schizophrenia may not necessarily be a life sentence. If companies see the
wisdom of allowing people with physical conditions such as cancer or broken
limbs time off to recuperate, why should they be prejudiced against the
mentally ill?

FT  29 SEP 93 / Management: Poet in the boardroom / Interview with Gertrud
Hohler, Germany's outspoken 'powerfrau' and a non-executive director at
Grand Metropolitan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Gertrud Hohler can surely be forgiven for sounding a touch smug. Three years
ago she seemed poised to take over as head of communications at Volkswagen,
Europe's largest car group. But in an about turn which obviously still
rankles today the company's supervisory board ignored the wishes of the then
chief executive Carl Hahn and blocked her appointment to the DM500,000
(Pounds 200,000) a year post.
'They didn't like the idea of Hahn bringing a woman to such a senior job,'
says the 52-year-old literature professor turned management guru.
Not surprisingly, Hohler has been a more than normally interested observer
of this summer's industrial espionage allegations against VW's Jose Ignacio
Lopez de Arriortua, an episode widely seen as a public relations disaster
for the car giant.
'Piech (VW's chief executive) has behaved in a thoroughly warlike way,' she
suggests, agreeing with those who say that the VW chief has had no public
relations policy, veering from injured silence at one moment to ill-thought
aggression at another.
Hohler has long been a familiar figure on the German corporate scene, but
her international profile was raised last November when she became a
non-executive director of Grand Metropolitan, the UK-based food and drinks
group. GrandMet was specifically looking for a foreigner and she was chosen
after a search by headhunters.
Hohler's outspokenness, in itself unusual in Germany, is not the only way in
which she differs from the ranks of Germany's management gurus. She is a
woman, moreover, and one taken seriously in the higher echelons of the
German business world where the female sex is not well represented.
She is also a former poetry prize-winner, professor of literature at
Paderborn University and author of a book on the poetry of Rainer Maria
Rilke.
She has subsequently written around a dozen books on management issues (the
latest one is entitled Rules of the Game for Winners), and for three years
worked as a close adviser to the board of the Deutsche Bank, Germany's
biggest bank. She has had her own television shows and has advised leading
politicians, and was tipped once as a possible member of Chancellor Kohl's
cabinet.
This cross-over into commercial life is again highly unusual in Germany; it
is almost unheard of for someone with a liberal arts background to make a
business career in Germany, where a doctorate on engineering or business
economics seems to be the sole passport to a management position.
In an environment where Edzard Reuter, chief executive of Daimler- Benz,
Germany's biggest company, stands out simply because he is a member of the
Social Democratic party rather than the conservative Christian Democrats,
Hohler provides a rare dash of corporate colour. This has been acknowledged
by the city of Aachen which honoured her with its prized 'Anti-Deadly
Seriousness' award.
Critics of the Hohler style - and there were believed to be many in the
conservative environment of the Deutsche Bank - say that her contribution to
the problems facing German managers is insubstantial and light-weight. They
point out that for all her promise she has never quite held on to the
position within the German political or industrial establishment which her
well-publicised talents would appear to justify.
Tall, striking and often sporting the 'Powerfrau' outfit of bright red
jacket and striped shirt, Hohler now runs a one-woman communications
consultancy in Berlin. But it is her vantage point in the boardroom of a UK
company - where she is a double rarity as a woman and foreigner - which is
perhaps most intriguing.
A specialist on corporate culture, she says she has been pleasantly
surprised at what she has learnt at Grand Met about the way the British
business world runs.
'British people tend to think that Germans are stiff and unfriendly, but the
reverse holds true as well,' she remarks. 'Germans have this idea of a
formidably formal upper-class business community. This impression is
reinforced by the formal way English people dress.
'This is true, but what has really astounded me is the mixture of formality
with a relaxed approach to doing business. They (the British) laugh more
than Germans and board meetings are less structured, without the deadly
seriousness which surrounds board meetings in Germany.
'But this doesn't stop meetings being disciplined and effective. That
English people should be so nonchalant without being in any way less
effective is difficult for Germans to grasp. There is an extremely quick
reaction to problems and mistakes. For example, in Germany the tendency is
to cover problems up in the hope that they will go away, to think that if we
don't notice the press won't notice either.
'Perhaps the biggest difference is in the attitude to profits. German
managers have the reputation for being hard-nosed businessmen but in reality
they are nervous about making money. In public they excuse themselves by
saying 'yes we want to make a profit but we are nice people as well,
really'. For British managers there is absolutely no contradiction between
morality and profit.'
Hohler clearly feels herself much more at home at Grand Met than at Deutsche
Bank (she is legally bound not to talk about her time there), although last
week's unexpected promotion of George Bull to the position of chief
executive of the UK company suggests that boardroom life in Britain can be
every bit as mysterious as in Germany.
Her main asset in the British boardroom, she says, is that 'I am much closer
to the consumer than my fellow directors', adding that she is probably the
only member of the board who has recently been shopping in a supermarket.
'Top managers tend to become a little isolated from reality,' although she
thinks this is less true for British businessmen than for Germans.

FT  29 SEP 93 / The Labour Party Conference: Scargill attacks party's MPs
over coal report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE party's bitter divisions over coal privatisation exploded yesterday in
an open row between Mr Arthur Scargill, president of the National Union of
Mineworkers, and Mr Richard Caborn, chairman of the Commons trade and
industry committee.
At the end of a bad-tempered debate, delegates defied the leadership by
overwhelmingly approving an NUM motion condemning pit closures and demanding
renationalisation of the coal industry.
The motion also confirmed conference support for Clause Four of the party
constitution - public ownership of the means of production, distribution and
exchange - reflecting continued grass roots support for policies regarded by
the party leadership as outmoded.
The row started with an attack by Mr Scargill on a Commons committee report
on the coal industry which followed the government's proposals last year for
widespread pit closures.
Mr Scargill said the four Labour MPs on the 11-member committee had
recommended longer working hours for miners to improve the competitive
position of British coal.
'I don't want Labour MPs sitting on the green benches of Westminster
fighting for a four-day week for themselves and recommending a seven-day
week for miners,' he told cheering delegates.
Mr Scargill said Labour's strategy of trying to win support for miners from
Conservative MPs was like 'crying out for snowflakes in the middle of July'.
He won a standing ovation from delegates, but was rebuked by Mr David
Blunkett, the shadow health secretary, who chaired the debate. Mr Blunkett
said it was 'very unfortunate when we turn our guns on ourselves'.
Mr Caborn, the MP for Sheffield Central, denied that Labour MPs were 'the
characters to sell out the mining industry', and claimed that Labour's
strategy had prompted the biggest Conservative rebellion since the last
election.
He accused Mr Scargill of failing to capitalise on the conclusions of the
committee's report, and urged the miners' leader to join a united front
against the government.
'There is still a chance,' he said. 'Let's unite the movement. Let's bring
on the bishops, bring on the churches, all those who want to have a say on
energy policy. I hand that to you Arthur. Please come on board.'
Ms Diana Jeuda, representing the national executive committee, asked
delegates to reject the NUM motion and concentrate on 'the real fight'
against privatisation.
She said the NEC would propose restoring public control of coal at next
year's conference 'if the government refuses to listen to public opinion'.

FT  29 SEP 93 / The Labour Party Conference: Hackles raised over
one-member-one-vote
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN

<TEXT>
DEFENDERS of Labour's union links failed yesterday to persuade the party
conference to support an emergency resolution blocking the leadership's
plans for reform.
But traditionalists promise a further battle today when the national
executive committee's proposals to 'modernise' the link are presented by Mr
John Smith, the party leader.
Attention has focused on plans to democratise the selection of parliamentary
candidates by limiting the franchise to individual party members - ending
the unions' right to cast up to 40 per cent of the vote.
This proposal, referred to as one-member-one-vote, is opposed by many
unions.
Their alternative would give an individual vote to union members who pay the
political levy which helps to finance Labour, most of whom are not party
members. Union leaders refer to this as every-member-one-vote.
Voting on the proposals will be complex. Delegates will be asked first to
approve a statement by the national executive committee setting out Mr
Smith's proposals.
Then there will be votes on eight resolutions followed by votes on five rule
changes to give effect to the NEC proposals.
For the leadership, the key will be the rule change votes. If approved, they
will take precedence over any successful resolutions.
The NEC statement makes three main proposals:
Parliamentary candidates would be selected by individual members voting in
their constituencies, instead of jointly by individuals and affiliated union
branches. Union members would have a vote, but only if they paid the
political levy and a further fee of Pounds 3 to join the party. Union
branches would retain the right to nominate candidates and to take part in
running constituency parties.
The leader and deputy leader would be elected by an electoral college giving
a third of the votes to each of three groups: unions, members of the
Westminster and European parliaments, and individual members. Unions have 40
per cent of the votes in the existing college, with the balance split
between parliamentarians and constituency parties.
The block vote would be weakened by forcing unions to split their votes
between individual delegates. However, unions would still be able to control
delegates by mandating them in advance. The unions' 70 per cent share of
conference votes would be reduced to 50 per cent, but only if party
membership increases from 260,000 to 300,000, reversing a long-term decline.
The rule changes required to give effect to these proposals will be
determined in a series of five 'card' votes, in which union leaders will
vote - under the existing rules - on behalf of all members who pay the
political levy.
The resolutions will matter only if one or more rule changes fail to pass.
Two are straightforward: composite 55, moved by the rightwing Amalgamated
Engineering and Electrical Union, broadly supports the NEC, and resolution
375, moved by Leicester East constituency party, supports the retention of
block voting.
Opposition to the leadership will centre on composite 58, moved by the TGWU,
and composite 57, from the GMB general workers' union. The GMB motion seeks
to preserve one third of selection votes for union levy payers, who would
vote through their unions without being required to join the party as
individuals.
The TGWU motion seeks to reserve 40 per cent of selection votes for levy
payers voting through their union, and to preserve the block vote. The
motion also instructs the NEC not to use its reserve powers to introduce a
revised system.
This is intended to block the leadership's fallback plan to impose
one-member-one-vote if the rule changes are defeated. If that happens, the
leadership's best hope is composite 56, which says that levy-paying union
members should participate in selections as individuals 'on a fairly agreed
basis.' The leadership says this phrase could be interpreted as
authorisation for the NEC proposals.

FT  29 SEP 93 / The Labour Party Conference: Beckett backs Union proposals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MRS MARGARET BECKETT, Labour's deputy leader, yesterday gave belated public
support to Mr John Smith's proposals for the party's links with the unions,
Philip Stephens writes.
In an attempt to patch up the rift before today's crucial conference debate
on one-member-one-vote, Mrs Beckett was persuaded to give a batch of
television interviews to stress that she backed his stance.
But her comments, which followed several days of apparent equivocation,
failed to convince senior colleagues that she had healed the breach with Mr
Smith.
Mrs Beckett, who is sponsored by one of the main opponents of
one-member-one-vote, the TGWU general union, was privately accused of
putting her own political interests ahead of those of the leader and shadow
cabinet. Senior colleagues said that she might be vulnerable to a challenge
for her post next year, although Mr Smith's aides rejected the idea that he
was ready to withdraw his support.

FT  29 SEP 93 / The Labour Party Conference: Queue forms to praise Smith,
not bury him - Alison Smith checks reaction to the party leader's speech
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS delegates streamed out of the conference hall after Mr John Smith's
speech, union leaders and MPs - even those hostile to his planned reform of
Labour's links with the unions - queued up to praise the vision the party
leader had set out.
Mr Bill Morris, general secretary of the TWGU, said it was a 'speech
delivered by a prime minister in waiting'.
Slightly less enthusiastically, Mr John Edmonds, the GMB leader, called it
'a very solid speech, made for the country as a whole'.
But Mr Edmonds and almost all the other delegates were in no doubt that at
least one passage - the coded reference to today's debate on reforming union
links - was directed solely at the conference.
To win the battle for constitutional reform, Mr Smith argued, 'we must have
the courage and the confidence to reform our own constitution as well'.
In this politically sophisticated audience, the significance was clearly
marked, as was the sustained applause that greeted it.
Ms Dawn Primarolo, a party health spokeswoman who has expressed opposition
to the reform and failed to win a seat on the national executive committee
on Monday, was alone in saying that she had not been sure exactly what Mr
Smith was referring to.
Mr Smith's aides appeared to think the speech had succeeded in swinging the
votes of enough constituency delegates to win the vote on reforming the role
of the unions in the selection of parliamentary candidates, but some senior
frontbench spokesmen were still not convinced.
Certainly not every delegate had been converted. 'Good but not inspiring'
was the verdict of one unmandated delegate from a southern constituency
party. 'His delivery was that of a Presbyterian minister, so I'll wait and
see what he says about union reforms'.
Many, however, said they liked the way the speech had concentrated on
employment rights and had underlined the party's commitment to trade
unionism. Others said they agreed that to make the case strongly for
constitutional reform, the party should reform itself.
Perhaps the best sign of the way Mr Smith's speech has maintained the
momentum for reform came from the delegates who have been mandated to vote
against the leadership but are now having a crisis of conscience as they
consider breaking their mandate to support a change to the links.
'I will not change my mind on the basis of the speech,' said one.
'I'll wait and see what he says about the reforms. But I liked what he said
about employment rights and low pay, and I agree we have to practise what we
preach on constitutional reform.'

FT  29 SEP 93 / The Labour Party Conference: Tory broadcast a 'pathetic
trick'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR last night attacked as a 'pathetic trick' a Tory party political
broadcast timed to precede news programmes reporting Mr John Smith's main
conference speech.
The broadcast, featuring a typical couple sitting in front of a blank
television screen, poked fun at the Labour leader, blaming him for the
party's tax policy in the run-up to the last election.
Labour said the broadcast showed the Conservatives were 'running scared'.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR BILL MORRIS, leader of the TGWU, last night warned that Labour must
address the 'vacuum ' that people perceived in its policies.
Speaking at a rally of the leftwing Tribune group, Mr Morris said that
voters often liked what Labour said about issues such as health and
education, but believed there was a lack of substance.
'We need to make the quantum leap from saying what is wrong to saying what
is right,' he said.

Mr Chris Smith, shadow environment secretary, promised to ban the

The 51-year-old Carrick Cumnock and Doon Valley MP took the step before
appearing in court where he admitted being drunk and disorderly and
assaulting a policeman.
Mr Foulkes was fined Pounds 1,050 with Pounds 500 costs and compensation by
London's Bow Street magistrates' court.
Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, said yesterday he had accepted Mr Foulkes'
resignation 'with great regret'.

FT  29 SEP 93 / The Labour Party Conference: Fresh battle looms over social
chapter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Labour party yesterday warned that it plans to re-open wounds in the
Conservative party over the Maastricht treaty by forcing a new Westminster
battle over Britain's contributions to the European Community.
Mr George Robertson, the party's European Affairs spokesman, said that
Labour planned to link its support for legislation to increase the EC's 'own
resources' ceiling with government acceptance of Maastricht's social
chapter.
The strategy raises the possibility of a re-run at Westminster of the final
stages of the Maastricht debate, in which the opposition parties and Tory
Euro-sceptics took Mr John Major's government to the brink of defeat on the
social chapter.
A parliamentary battle over financing would also threaten to keep
Conservative divisions over Europe in the spotlight as next summer's
elections for the European parliament approach.
The government has to bring forward legislation to allow increased
contributions to Brussels following an agreement at last December's to raise
the allowed ceiling on the Community's expenditure.
But some of the Tory Euro-sceptics who were forced into line over Maastricht
by Mr Major's threat of a general election have indicated privately they are
ready to oppose the legislation.
Mr Robertson said that, as with the legislation to implement Maastricht,
Labour would not seek to 'wreck' the passage of the financial bill. But it
would 'tie its conclusion to signature of the social chapter'.
Mr Robertson said: 'I am sure it will be possible to devise an amendment
which will tie the government's hands'.
Adding that Labour would table other amendments to the proposed bill to
secure more European funding for regional and social spending, Mr Robertson
said: 'This bill must get through but it is already in trouble. The
government simply does not have a majority'.
Whitehall officials indicated yesterday that they were relaxed about such a
possibility, suggesting that only a handful of Tory Euro-sceptics would be
ready to oppose the government.
Mr Major would also hope to be able to secure the tacit support of the
Liberal Democrats and, possibly, the Ulster Unionists.
But one leading Tory Euro-sceptic said yesterday that the issue of increased
funding for Brussels could well provide another battleground with the
government.
Many of the opponents of Maastricht remain unconvinced of the more sceptical
stance towards Europe adopted by Mr Major in his declared approach to the
EC's medium-term agenda.
Lord Tebbit, one of the fiercest opponents of the treaty, is expected to
call for a much tougher stance against integration at next week's
Conservative party conference in Blackpool.

<TEXT>
'I don't want Labour MPs sitting on the green benches of Westminster
fighting for a four-day week for themselves and recommending a seven-day
week for miners.'
Arthur Scargill, NUM president
'Let's put socialism back on the agenda.'
Dennis Skinner
'I gather John Major has decided to take a fresh look at employment rights.
He's finding out what it's like to be at the mercy of a particularly
ruthless employer - the Conservative party. Perhaps even at this late stage
he may decide that the Social Charter is a good thing after all.'
John Smith
'Let's go back from conference and raise the stakes. Together we can shunt
this discredited Railways Bill back into the sidings for good, and that's
where it belongs.'
Jimmy Knapp, RMT leader
'Mr Smith set out to meet a trade union wish list - minimum wage, guaranteed
trade union recognition, a strikers' charter of new rights for unions, a
politically correct list of legislation.'
Sir Norman Fowler, Tory party chairman
'I don't think I should be too hard on John Major. He is beginning to
understand what his party's made of. He has discovered that members of his
cabinet are - let me put this more delicately than the prime minister - of
doubtful parentage.'
John Smith
'I hope and believe he (Mr Smith) will win this week. I hope nobody can
misinterpret that in any way at all.'
Margaret Beckett, deputy leader

FT  29 SEP 93 / The Labour Party Conference: Pressure mounts on smaller
delegations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SUPPORTERS of Mr John Smith's reform proposals were yesterday involved in a
frantic last-minute scramble to persuade union delegations and constituency
party delegates to switch their votes behind the Labour leader, David
Goodhart writes.
Mr Neil Kinnock, the former leader, addressed the seven delegates of the
Northampton-based knitwear workers' union NKFAT who were said to be
impressed by his visit but still undecided.
The left-led engineering section of the National Communications Union was
also visited by Mr Rodney Bickerstaffe, general secretary of the Nupe public
services union, and his deputy, Mr Tom Sawyer, both of whom still carry
influence with the left in the unions. The NCU is expected to take a final
decision today.
The MSF technical union, which also has a left-dominated delegation, has
still not reached a final decision on the crucial rule change, and is sure
to come under further pressure today.
Mr David Blunkett, shadow health secretary, last night appealed to leftwing
unions and undecided delegates at the annual Tribune rally, saying that the
recent clarification of the one-member-one-vote policy allowed mandated
delegates to change their positions.
Earlier the GPMU print union, another small union opposing reform, was also
subjected to strong pressure from the Labour leadership but refused to
budge.
There was also dismay from reform supporters when it was discovered that the
Fabian Society, usually associated with party modernisation, was unable to
cast its small number of votes for the leader because of a policy of
remaining above factionalism in the party.

FT  29 SEP 93 / The Labour Party Conference: Prescott reveals government's
rail plans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A LEAKED COPY of the transport secretary's working diary over the next two
months was used yesterday by Mr John Prescott, Labour's transport spokesman,
to highlight a number of initiatives likely to be announced at next week's
Tory party conference.
Mr Prescott said Mr John MacGregor's conference speech will probably include
the following:
The Victoria to Gatwick rail franchise service will begin on October 10.
The first Channel tunnel train will visit Waterloo station in October. Work
on the Jubileee line extension will start on November 1.
The Pounds 150m leasing decision on rolling stock in the run-up to
privatisation will be announced and 'undoubtedly go to Network SouthEast'.
The diary also confirmed that the announcement of rail fare rises was to be
delayed until later next month, said Mr Prescott.
Later, Mr MacGregor said his diary only contained what people expected to be
coming up. 'There are no surprises in it at all,' he said.
In his speech Mr Prescott said a future Labour government would take a
privatised rail network back into public ownership.
'Let me make it crystal clear,' he said. 'Any privatisation of the railway
system will be quickly and effectively dealt with, on the arrival of a
Labour government, by returning it to public ownership.'
Mr Prescott, whose speech prompted a standing ovation, said the government
was pushing ahead with rail privatisation to 'rob' the railway workers'
pension fund 'to pay for the Treasury's failures'.
He said Mr MacGregor was 'obsessed' by roads. The government's concern for
roads was motivated by 'the crisis in the Treasury' rather than by the needs
of a transport system.
'The government exploits roads for the Pounds 18bn a year they generate in
taxes,' said Mr Prescott. VAT on public transport would raise a further
Pounds 2bn, he warned.
Mr Jimmy Knapp, leader of the RMT transport union, demanded a halt to plans
for the rail privatisation. He warned: 'Railway workers are slow to get
angry, but I can tell you there is now a deep, deep anger burning in us
about what is happening.'

FT  29 SEP 93 / The Labour Party Conference: Intellectual outsider steps up
to the crease - GMB leader John Edmonds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN EDMONDS, who may today deliver a powerful blow to Mr John Smith's
leadership of the Labour party, is the most able and complex of Britain's
union bosses. The only one who, like his hero Ernest Bevin, would not be out
of his depth serving in a Labour cabinet.
But any chance that he might get that opportunity has withered over the past
few months irrespective of what happens in today's vote on the
one-member-one-vote proposal - backed by Mr Smith and opposed by Mr Edmonds.
Many among the Labour leadership, particularly the 'modernisers', have been
appalled by what they see as betrayal by a union leader usually associated
with moderate, progressive, causes.
The hostile views of his erstwhile political allies in both the party and
the unions hurts Mr Edmonds. He also accepts that his stand will, at least
in the short term, harm both Mr Smith and himself.
But Mr Edmonds, 48, is used to being an outsider. The son of a Transport and
General Workers Union shop steward who won a scholarship to fee-paying
Christ's Hospital - where as a young batsman he was once bowled out by
future England fast bowler John Snow - has never found a niche in the union
movement. He is resented for his brains and his arrogance, and his laboured
humour does little to compensate.
After studying history at Oxford he climbed the greasy pole in the GMB
general union. He is now poised to lead his union into a merger with the
TGWU and has a good chance of emerging as the leader of the joint union.
Some of his critics allege that Mr Edmonds' refusal to accept a small
reduction in union influence in the selection of parliamentary candidates is
bound up with that leadership ambition.
Despite his support for a loosening of the party-union links in the late
1980s, he now defends the link because, it is alleged by his detractors,
that will increase his popularity with leftwing activists in the TGWU.
He rejects that and argues for the rights of levy-paying unionists who are
not, and do not want to be, full party members, but want some local
political influence in return for their money.
His aides also claim that while Mr Edmonds has great authority in his
official-dominated union, the regional barons have ensured that he does not
waver on the issue of one-member-one-vote.
But some critics stress his record for inconsistency. Others stress his
vanity. 'John has a big political ego and without an important role in the
Labour party the TV cameras would not be at his front door', said one Labour
MP.
It was certainly Mr Edmonds' premature TV endorsement of Mr John Smith for
the leadership that gave an anti-union twist to the subsequent debate about
reforming the links.
Vain or not, Mr Edmonds is certainly not a man who underestimates his
ability to change the course of history.
Asked recently by New Statesman magazine which day he would visit if he
could travel back in time, he replied: 'The day in August 1917 when, with
anti-Bolshevik feeling growing in Russia, Kerensky decided not to move
against Lenin.'
Mr Edmonds was not able to prevent 75 years of division in the world labour
movement but, his critics accuse, he is inflicting incalculable damage to
today's Labour party by reminding the voters how much power is still wielded
by union barons.

schools are run, in return for greater investment in education by private
companies.
Mr Michael Ashcroft, chairman of the new Education In Industry group of
business leaders, said changes might include the provision of full education
courses by companies for children over 14, longer school days and the
introduction of a five-term year.
Mr Ashcroft, who chairs the security and vehicle auctions group ADT, added
that lengthening the school day and increasing the number of terms would
help parents working part-time or flexitime, and allow pupils to spend more
time on vocational education.
Companies would also provide marketing, promotional and fundraising
activities. The group will also lobby for industrialists' views on
education.
Mr Ashcroft said school-leavers were not adequately prepared for employment.
'Unless we can systematically improve educational standards, this nation,
its businesses and prosperity are at risk.' He listed measures required by
industrialists, including:
Minimum standards in literacy and numeracy.
New targets that require a second foreign language, computer skills,
technology and vocational training.
Employer-provided approved education courses for pupils aged 14 and over.
Lengthening the school day.
A five-term year.
Compulsory industrial work experience for all trainee teachers.
Mr Ashcroft said the focus of secondary education should move from age 16 to
move in line with practice on the Continent, because this would allow more
concentration on vocational courses at an earlier stage.
The new group has full government backing. Its launch was attended by Mr
John Patten, education secretary, and three education ministers. It
signalled strong support for the government's proposal this week to channel
funds towards schools which specialise in technology. However, the trust
intends to remain non-partisan and will not receive any public funds.
Founder trustees include the the directors of the Institute of Management
and the Institute of Personnel Management, and the heads of Norwich Union,
George Wimpey, Vauxhall Motors, Cable &amp; Wireless, Dixons, Burton Group, and
the British Railways Board.

FT  29 SEP 93 / Patten attacks 'duff' schools
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN Patten, education secretary, said yesterday that he had a list of
several hundred 'duff' schools - mostly in inner cities - where the march of
reform was being 'debauched'.
Mr Patten said he was considering replacing local authority control of the
schools with management teams called 'educational associations'.
Mr David Hart, general secretary of the National Association of Head
Teachers, said the issue of educational associations could become a
'battlefield' for the next few years.
Mr Patten said: 'There are clusters of schools who I think are
short-changing pupils horribly.
'The march of reform is being debauched in those areas. There will be action
after January 1.'
Speaking to business leaders at the launch of Education in Industry, he said
that he would act on the advice of inspectors who are reviewing the schools.
He refused to name them, but said most were in inner cities with
concentrations in a few London boroughs.
Teachers' union leaders said the comments suggested that educational
associations would be used to force more schools into opting out of local
education authority control.
Mr Peter Smith, general secretary of the Association of Teachers and
Lecturers, said that Mr Patten's new power 'had always been justified as a
last-resort measure'.
He said Mr Patten would need to have the 'firmest evidence' before sending
in educational associations to remedy a problem.
Mr Doug McAvoy, general secretary of the National Union of Teachers,
described the remarks as insulting and unhelpful, adding that they did not
help the situation.

FT  29 SEP 93 / Pit roof-bolting cleared by HSE
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
OLD WORKINGS and waste material were the principal causes of the roof
cave-in at Bilsthorpe Colliery in which three people died, an interim report
published yesterday by the Health and Safety Executive has found.
It says the controversial roof-bolting system was the primary means of
support in the area of the Nottinghamshire mine half a mile below the
surface in which the fall occurred. But the size of the collapse was such
that any free-standing support would have been unable to withstand the load.
The inquiry team's main conclusion in a highly technical 40-page document is
that the presence of an old roadway and associated waste were the principal
factors contributing to last month's collapse.
Mr Brian Langdon, deputy chief inspector of mines, said: 'Common features of
the major falls, such as the one at Bilsthorpe, are their unpredictability
and suddenness of collapse, giving little or no chance of escape to those in
the immediate vicinity.'
Mr Langdon said strata behaviour was not an exact science and more work had
to be done to obtain greater understanding and to be able to measure more
accurately the effects of coal pillars on mine workings.
'Until there is a clearer understanding, the practice of 'skin-to-skin'
working - whereby a new road is driven immediately alongside an old road and
adjacent waste with no intervening coal pillar - has been discontinued by
British Coal in this and other mines.'
Mr Langdon's interim report will be followed by a full report later. The HSE
has drawn no final conclusions or made any recommendations on the findings
to date.
British Coal said the inquiry's conclusions were 'substantially in accord'
with its own. 'The report acknowledges that the roof-bolting standards at
Bilsthorpe were good,' said the corporation.
Mr Langdon said he had found no evidence to suggest that safety standards
were being marginalised in the privatisation of the coal industry.

FT  29 SEP 93 / Director disqualifications jump by 42% to record
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NUMBER of company directors disqualified last year jumped by 42 per cent
to a record, the Department of Trade and Industry said yesterday.
The figures reflect the sharp increase in company failures during the
recession, which has led to a growing number of reports from insolvency
practitioners and the official receivers' office on the conduct of
directors.
According to the DTI's latest annual Company Trends report, 651 directors
were disqualified in the 12 months to April this year. This compares with
460 in 1991-92.
Most took place under the provisions of the 1986 Directors' Disqualification
Act.
But they still represent a tiny proportion of the total number of cases of
corporate failure during the period.
The DTI said that the most recent figures typically related to the directors
of companies which failed two years ago, because a growing number are now
delaying disqualification by fighting their cases in the courts.
About 900 disqualification recommendations from the government's Insolvency
Service, part of the DTI, are being processed through the courts.
There were 446 disqualifications of unfit directors of insolvent companies,
and 178 were barred after being convicted of company-related offences.
Ministers have approved increases of about 9 per cent in budget and staffing
levels within the Insolvency Service, for this year. The increases are
designed particularly to strengthen its investigations and disqualification
functions.
The action followed concerns expressed in the service's annual report last
year that maintaining standards was proving difficult at a time when the
case load was rising.
Mr Phil Wallace, an insolvency partner with accountants KPMG Peat Marwick,
said last night: 'The problem is staffing and what the service can handle.
They take on only those cases which are pretty blatant.'
He stressed that any more aggressive attempts to push for disqualifying more
directors had to be balanced against the increased costs which would be
levied on creditors if insolvency practitioners needed to spend more time
co-operating with investigators.
The DTI considered 1,083 requests for investigations, which led to the start
of 187 statutory examinations during the year including 16 handled by
outside accountants. Eight trials led to the conviction of 19 individuals.

FT  29 SEP 93 / Coal consortium appoints chief
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A CONSORTIUM formed to bid for all British Coal's assets in Scotland
yesterday signalled its determination to push ahead by appointing a senior
Scottish businessman as its chief executive.
Mr Brian MacDonald, formerly managing director of the Turner Group, a
privately-owned engineering services company, is to manage and arrange
finance for the bid by Mining (Scotland).
Mining (Scotland)'s co-chairman Professor Ross Harper, a Glasgow solicitor
and prominent Conservative, said the consortium hoped to be in possession of
British Coal's Scottish assets by the end of next year.
Earlier this month the government announced that it would be offering
British Coal for sale as five regional businesses, one of which would be
Scotland. A privatisation bill is expected in the Queen's Speech in
November.
British Coal has only one working deep mine in Scotland, Longannet, which
supplies ScottishPower. It also has the Frances pit in Fife which is
retained on a care and maintenance basis, as well as substantial opencast
mines.
Mr MacDonald, 54, said his job would end with the appointment of a chief
executive to operate the company on the success of the bid.
So far no other companies have declared an interest in buying British Coal's
Scottish assets.

FT  29 SEP 93 / Estate agent's details on trial
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RACHEL JOHNSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FIRST estate agent to be prosecuted under the new Property
Misdescriptions Act - aimed at eliminating misleading and exaggerated
wording from house details - is to appear in court next week.
Mr Ian Sinclair, a chartered surveyor who runs an estate agency in Great
Yarmouth, is to appear before the town's magistrates' court on Monday to
face two alleged offences under this year's Act.
Norfolk Trading Standards, part of the county council, is bringing the case.
Mr Steve Holland, deputy county trading standards officer, said the first
alleged offence was that Mr Sinclair had advertised the price of a house in
a local newspaper as being less than the house actually cost.
The second was that Mr Sinclair had failed to alter the price of a property
advertised in his shop window to reflect the real price of the house.
Mr David Goldsworthy, president of the Warwick-based National Association of
Estate Agents, said that the legislation was a 'sledgehammer to crack a
nut'.
Mr Goldsworthy said: 'It will all boil to down to whether it was a genuine
mistake or deliberately misleading.'
The Department of Trade and Industry said the Norfolk case was the first
they had heard of since the law was enacted earlier this year. It pointed
out that more cases might be pending on court waiting lists.

FT  29 SEP 93 / Airport TV may buy live news
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PLANS ARE well advanced for the launch early next year of Airport
Television, a service for passengers at six of the UK's largest airports. It
will be on air 17 hours a day with a mixture of news and light
entertainment.
Sky Sites, the company launching the service, said yesterday it was
discussing with news providers the possibility of live news for Airport TV,
which will be financed by advertising.
Sky Sites holds the concession to advertise in the six British Airport
Authority airports - Heathrow, Gatwick, Stansted, Glasgow, Edinburgh and
Aberdeen.
Mr Sohan Singh, deputy managing director of Sky Sites, said yesterday he was
talking to the BBC, Sky News and Mr Ted Turner's Cable News Network about a
live news service. Sky News is provided by British Sky Broadcasting - in
which Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, has a stake.
CNN already operates a dedicated airport television service in the US and is
interested in extending the concept.
The six BAA airports will be linked by land lines, perhaps moving later to
satellite distribution to a larger number of airports.

FT  29 SEP 93 / Ministers hold key to Swans' EC funding
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SWAN HUNTER, the threat-ened Tyneside shipbuilder, can be considered for an
intervention funding subsidy only if the government can prove the yard is of
strategic military importance, the European Commission said yesterday.
A delegation of Labour MPs, MEPs and shop stewards from the company, which
has been in receivership since May, met Mr Karel Van Miert, EC competition
commissioner, to press Swans' case for the 9 per cent EC subsidy on merchant
shipbuilding orders.
Swans' chances of finding a buyer could be enhanced by funding eligibility,
and the delegation argued that Swans was the only European shipyard building
merchant and naval ships without any subsidy.
Until now the emphasis of the campaign has been to stress Swans' involvement
in merchant shipbuilding, for which Continental shipyards have been able to
claim intervention funding subsidies.
The EC's stance at yesterday's meeting unexpectedly switched the emphasis to
Swans' place in the UK's defence capability.
Mr Alan Donnelly, Tyne and Wear's Labour MEP, said: 'The only condition that
the EC will accept in granting subsidies to Swan Hunter is if the British
government can prove the yard is of strategic military importance.' Mr Van
Miert had stressed that the argument had to come from the government,
particularly the Ministry of Defence.

FT  29 SEP 93 / Cases Lautro tries to prevent
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TYPE of cases Lautro is trying to prevent:
A couple take on a five-year interest-only loan. At the end of five years,
they will have to find the cash to pay the capital balance.
An enterprising insurance sales agent, following the principle that
suitability means the most suitable product sold by his company, signs up
the couple for a 10-year savings policy intended to pay off the loan. His
company simply does not offer a five-year product.
This is a real example, and not surprisingly, when the loan matured, the
savings policy could not pay it off.
Lautro also cites the case of a young man in temporary employment who was
sold a long-term savings plan. 'There was no evidence on the fact-find that
the investor wished to save for that period; indeed, he appeared unlikely to
be able to maintain any rate of savings commitment,' Lautro noted.
In similar vein, Lautro notes the case of a divorcee who wished to invest
Pounds 15,000 in a school fees plan for the education of her three sons. The
sum fell far short of what would be needed to cover fees, but the adviser
placed her investment in a highly volatile Japanese fund. Although returns
in some previous years had been extremely rewarding, the woman could well
have been forced to cash the investment in during a severe downcycle. Thus,
the investment was unsuitable.
These are among several examples cited by Lautro of sales of unsuitable
products.
The life insurance industry has maintained for years that the sale of
unsuitable products is rare and that most people do obtain best advice.

FT  29 SEP 93 / Red line opts for bottom line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RED ARMY is finally succumbing to capitalism. Russian army officers made
redundant after the collapse of the Communist regime are to be taught by
British university lecturers how to set up and run small businesses.
Officers trained to revile western ideals will be urged to embrace them
under a government-backed scheme unveiled yesterday. Starting in November
and funded by a Pounds 317,000 Foreign Office grant, courses will be offered
in financial management, accounting and marketing.
The initial course will involve more than 800 officers who lost their jobs
when the Soviet armed forces were disbanded.
Former intelligence officers, submarine commanders and logistics chiefs are
expected to be among the trainees at four new business centres established
in Moscow, Tula, Tomsk and Nizhny Novgorod by lecturers from Coventry
University.
The lecturers say they are ready to launch an offensive on the old ideals of
men and women who had spent most of their lives in a managed economy.
Mr Noel Hibbert, director of the university's European Training Agency,
said: 'We've already found a big problem with their marketing skills. They
hit upon ideas for a business without finding out if there's any demand.'
While setting up a separate course in democracy, lecturers had to persuade a
former nuclear submarine commander that there was no demand for a company
selling reconnaissance film.
Another officer with experience of ground-to-air weaponry was dissuaded from
planning a toy company making boomerangs.
The three-week training schedule promises to be an assault course in finance
with tests in auditing and management skills.
The final obstacle for officers hoping to join the ranks of entrepreneurs
targeting Mother Russia will be an interview with officials of the staunchly
capitalist European Bank for Reconstruction and Development.
In return for an equity stake in any company it deems worthy of backing, the
EBRD will offer credits worth up to Dollars 30,000 (Pounds 19,500).
'They're queueing up to join the courses,' said Mr Hibbert. 'It means we can
assist with the demobilisation of Russian armed forces.'
Aware of the sensitivity needed to deal with the one-time elite of the
Warsaw Pact, the university has decided to train 36 senior Russian officers
in Coventry as lecturers in the new year.
They, in turn, will spread the capitalist message to some of the 450,000
military personnel made redundant after the fall of communism.

FT  29 SEP 93 / Insurers win global premium income boost
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WORLDWIDE premium income for UK insurance companies rose 12 per cent to
Pounds 83.6bn last year, the Association of British Insurers reported
yesterday.
Long-term business rose to Pounds 52.5bn last year compared with Pounds
47.5bn in 1991. General business was Pounds 31.3bn against Pounds 27.3bn in
the previous year.
The figures are based on a survey of the 450 association members and a
number of large non-members, and are estimated to cover 99 per cent of
long-term business and 93 per cent of general insurance business.
There were 6.4m new life policies taken out last year, bringing the total to
86m individual policies in force at the end of the year.
Annual premiums on new long-term UK individual business fell slightly to
Pounds 3.1bn while single premiums rose to Pounds 14.2bn.
Worldwide general business underwriting resulted in losses of Pounds 4.9bn
against a loss of Pounds 7bn in 1991, reducing the proportion of losses to
premiums from 25.5 per cent to 15.7 per cent.
Insurance companies paid out more than Pounds 2.1bn on theft and arson
claims last year. The association estimated the costs of the IRA bombs in
April 1992 at St Mary Axe and Staples Corner in London at Pounds 350m, and
the 1993 Bishopsgate bombing at Pounds 500m.
Annual average payments by British households on all forms of insurance rose
11 per cent to Pounds 979 between 1990 and 1991, according to the latest
figures supplied to the association by the Central Statistical Office.
Average yearly household expenditure on motor insurance was Pounds 260 in
1991. Nearly two thirds of households paid motor premiums.
Only 9 per cent of households had private medical insurance, which covered
only individuals not covered in private schemes through their companies.

FT  29 SEP 93 / Lautro tightens rules on finance product sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LAUTRO, the self-regulatory body for the life insurance industry, has issued
a guide for sales agents spelling out circumstances in which they should not
recommend a purchase of any of their products to a client.
The rules, which dwell on the issue of 'suitability', define much more
narrowly the kind of product which can be recommended in certain
circumstances, and are likely to have a significant impact particularly on
insurance companies which market a limited product range.
Sales agents have been interpreting rules on suitability to mean the product
offered by their employer that comes closest to meeting the client's
specific needs, even though it may not meet those needs exactly. Lautro
warned in a bulletin issued yesterday that its enforcement staff and its
complaints subcommittee will 'routinely look particularly closely at queries
about 'best advice' which arise in the context of such members'.
The Financial Services Act requires sales agents to give best advice about
which product to purchase.
Industry regulators have said one of their chief aims is to curb the sale of
'unsuitable' products. Sales of such products often lead to early encashment
of insurance policies. The front-ended nature of most insurance contracts
means that those who cancel early lose most of the premiums paid in the
first year or so, costing investors millions of pounds every year.
In its enforcement bulletin 23, Lautro said it was trying in response to
enquiries from members to clarify an earlier statement. That statement had
told members how to check that sales agents had ascertained a client's needs
and had recommended only the purchase of a suitable product.
'Some members then ask: 'How is suitability to be defined?',' Lautro said.
'It will be clear . . . that in general terms the monitoring committee does
not regard suitability as synonymous with the closest match.'
Among factors to be taken into consideration are whether a client is likely
to need the proceeds of any investment before the investment matures.
If so, will the value of the investment be sufficient to meet client needs,
and will it represent a reasonable rate of return?
Also, the client must demonstrate his ability to meet the costs of the
investment. A product which requires too great a proportion of a client's
disposable income will not be deemed suitable.

FT  29 SEP 93 / Tory councils block tendering drive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONSERVATIVE-controlled local authorities have taken the lead in thwarting
the government's compulsory competitive tendering programme, a survey
revealed yesterday.
They are doing so using the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of
Employment) regulations 1981. Where Tupe applies, a successful bidder must
take over the workforce on the existing terms and conditions. Of councils
which have tendered contracts stating that Tupe applies, 36 per cent were
Conservative, while only 26 per cent were Labour-controlled and 5 per cent
were held by the Liberal Democrats.
The survey of 50 contractors by the Clause 26 lobby group showed deep
disquiet with the government's response to the Tupe issue - 97 per cent
labelled it unsatisfactory. Almost half (45 per cent) would not have entered
the market in local authority services in 1988 had they known that Tupe
would be an issue.
Mr Cliff Davis-Coleman, director of Clause 26, said that Conservative
authorities' reaction was due to the Department of the Environment's
'confused legal position'.
He added that this had been worsened by Monday's consultative paper. Under
the proposed guidelines, if a local authority has legal advice that Tupe
applies but the bid assumes that it does not, the contractor should be
invited to reconsider the bid. If the contractor refuses to revise a bid,
the authority can reject it even if it is the cheapest.
Mr Davis-Coleman said this means that 'only a lawyer employed by a local
authority can determine whether Tupe applies'.

FT  29 SEP 93 / M-way levy 'will clog rural roads
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
'DRIVERS switching from motorways on which charges are imposed will clog
rural roads already set for a tripling or quadrupling of traffic, the
Countryside Commission, the government's landscape watchdog, has warned in a
letter to the Department of Transport.
Mr Roger Clarke, the commission's director of policy, hopes research now
being undertaken by the transport department will be published.
Evidence so far suggests that even a low motorway charge of 1 1/2 p a mile
for cars and 4 1/2 p for trucks could lead to a 10 per cent diversion.
'This translates, for example, into an extra 50 per cent to 70 per cent
traffic on the A34 parallel to the M6 in Staffordshire,' Mr Clarke said.
'The wider distribution of traffic on to secondary and minor roads could
consequently be even more damaging at even higher percentage rates.'
Responding to the green paper on motorways, the commission said it did not
oppose the principle of charging, but believed any levy should fit into a
wider national strategy for traffic demand management.
The commission claimed that the motorway network was catering for local
traffic. Recent evidence suggests that, on the M25 for example, less than 1
per cent of traffic has an origin and destination outside the south-east,
with 55 per cent of cars and 49 per cent of trucks travelling for less than
30 miles.
Eighty-five per cent of all traffic is non-motorway, the commission said. So
congestion was already worse and environmental costs higher for ordinary
roads than for motorways.

FT  29 SEP 93 / EOC urges Hunt to back better maternity rights
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Equal Opportunities Commission yesterday urged Mr David Hunt, employment
secretary, to back its campaign for better maternity rights. The government
was accused by Ms Karnlesh Bahl, who chairs the commission, of 'missing a
golden opportunity to create a clear, simple, forward-looking maternity
rights scheme which could be easily understood by both pregnant women and
employers'.
The commission says it is concerned that 'the spirit of the European
Community directive on maternity rights (due to be implemented by October
next year) has been lost in translation into UK legislation'. In Britain
women will be entitled to only 14 weeks maternity leave after which they
will be vulnerable to dismissal if they remain away.
The government proposes that employers alone should meet maternity costs.
The commission fears that such a system might lead employers to discriminate
against women.
The commission argues that 2.25m women who earn less than Pounds 56 a week
will fail to qualify for statutory maternity pay. It adds that notification
procedures for pregnant women to take leave will remain complex. It also
says women will have the right to 18 weeks' pay but only 14 weeks' leave,
and that this could lead to discriminatory practices and even dismissals.
It also points out that statutory maternity pay amounts to less than 20 per
cent of women's average earnings while women workers in the UK take 30 weeks
maternity leave but receive no pay for their final 12 weeks away from work.
The EOC wants Mr Hunt to:
Provide guidance to employers on non-discriminatory recruitment policies.
Adopt a system for leave that would pay women Pounds 52.50 a week for 18
weeks - and 90 per cent of pay for the first 6 weeks to women who had worked
for at least 26 weeks with their present employer. Change the law 'as soon
as is practicable' to extend maternity leave from 14 weeks to 18 weeks.

FT  29 SEP 93 / Ban Regal cigarette ads, says watchdog
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Marketing Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE HEALTH Education Authority yesterday called for a ban on advertisements
for Embassy Regal cigarettes following research which is said to show that
the advertisements appeal to children and teenagers.
It is the first time the government-funded authority, which opposes all
tobacco promotion, has attacked the advertising of one brand.
The move came as the government's chief medical officer, Dr Kenneth Calman,
disclosed in his annual report yesterday that the number of teenage smokers
has not fallen significantly in recent years.
The HEA has written to the Advertising Standards Authority calling for the
withdrawal of posters which feature a middle-aged, irreverent character
called Reg and his views on life.
The posters - which appear mainly in Scotland, Wales and northern England -
have the ASA approval required by all cigarette advertisements under a
voluntary industry agreement. The posters have also won two top advertising
industry awards.
The HEA said its research showed that 91 per cent of teenagers in northern
England had seen the 'Reg' advertisements compared with 49 per cent of
adults. More boys aged nine and 10 than adults liked the campaign, it said.
According to the HEA's findings: 'Reg's irreverent view of authority appears
to be just what children want to hear. His flippant attitude to life is
extended to smoking, and it has become clear that children felt that Reg is
giving them permission to smoke.'
The HEA says the research demonstrates that the campaign contravenes ASA
rules. Those state that cigarette advertisements 'should not be designed,
written or published in such a way as to make it likely that they will
appeal more to those under 18 than to the public at large'.
Examples of the slogans are: Reg on party politics - 'If you drop ash on the
carpet you won't get invited again'; Reg on the Exchange Rate Mechanism -
'Erm'.
The HEA says Reg has become an 'icon' among children who see him on the way
to school every day. Surveys showed that 'children in Manchester no longer
called each other a Wally to denote stupidity, they called each other a
Reg,' said the authority.
The ASA said yesterday that it would study the findings. The advertising
agency responsible for the campaign, Lowe Howard-Spink, denied that it had
targeted children for the campaign. Imperial Tobacco, the Hanson subsidiary
which owns the brand, said the intention had been to 'persuade smokers of
other manufacturers' brands to switch to our own, not to persuade anyone to
start smoking or to smoke more'.
The advertising agency and Imperial Tobacco both said they had not yet
examined the HEA's methodology.

FT  29 SEP 93 / Confidence 'declining' in northern England
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONFIDENCE is declining in the north, says the sixth survey in two years of
about 800 companies by Latham, Crossley and Davis, the Manchester, Wigan and
Chorley accountancy firm.
The firm says the recovery in northern England is in danger of stagnating
because too few companies are looking for new markets, developing new
products or finding alternatives to the banks for financing growth.
The research, completed two weeks ago, asked companies to rate their
confidence on a scale of one to 10. The average rating in the latest survey
was 5.3 compared with 5.5 in the middle of last year, 6.5 last November and
6.25 in April this year.
'The drop in confidence reflects the patchy nature of the recovery,' Mr
Keith Seeley, the firm's managing partner, said yesterday. 'Leasing
businesses and automotive services companies expressed continued high
confidence, but engineering companies scored their optimism much lower.'
Nearly two thirds of companies in the survey expected any increase in orders
to come from established customers buying existing products. Only 26 per
cent were developing new products or seeking new markets while only 10 per
cent foresaw exports as their main sales boost.
Nearly half expected to use a bank overdraft or loans to finance growth,
while 39 per cent were trying to use cash retained in the business.

FT  29 SEP 93 / Pig genes advance transplant hopes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON, Science Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SCIENTISTS yesterday claimed a 'breakthrough' in the genetic engineering of
pigs to provide organs for transplantation to humans.
Researchers from DNX Biotherapeutics of Princeton, New Jersey, told a
conference in Cambridge that they had bred animals with human genes which
would prevent their organs being rejected by the patient's immune system
after transplant-ation.
'If we are able to maintain our current rate of progress, DNX should be
poised to begin human clinical testing of transgenic pig organs in three to
five years,' said Dr John Logan, the company's head of research. Kidneys and
hearts are likely to be used first.
If unaltered pig organs were transplanted to humans, they would be destroyed
within hours by part of the immune system called 'complement' which is
normally held in check by 'inhibition factors'. With genetic engineering,
the DNX scientists have produced pigs that make two human inhibition
factors.
Patients are expected to react to the transgenic organs as they would to a
transplant from another human. They will still need to be treated with drugs
to suppress the immune system, but the pig organs are likely to last for as
long as their human equivalents.
Mr Steven Holtzman, DNX president, said the company wanted to solve the
severe worldwide shortage of transplant organs by breeding special herds of
transgenic pigs.
'We estimate that at least 100,000 patients worldwide could then receive
transplants.'
'We believe it is ethical to use an animal to save a human life,' Mr
Holtzman added, though he conceded that some animal rights advocates would
find the work unacceptable.
Asked about possible religious objections to pig transplants, he said: 'We
have taken rabbinical advice and for Jews it is a dietary prohibition, so
there is no bar to the use of pig organs. I don't know what the Koran has to
say on this.'

FT  29 SEP 93 / NHS chief predicts hospital mergers
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MORE HOSPITALS are likely to close and others will be merged as the
responsibility for care shifts into the community, Sir Duncan Nichol, NHS
chief executive, predicted yesterday.
He expected bed closures to continue as medical advances led to shorter
stays in hospital and more day surgery.
That was likely to lead to hospitals merging in order to survive and plans
for new hospitals being shelved.
Sir Duncan said the number of hospital beds in Britain had fallen by 20 per
cent over the past decade. Speaking at a conference organised by the NHS
Trust Federation, he added that further closures would be hard for some
communities to accept.
But the time had come for 'more imaginative' ways of spending money on
patient care. Too much was now being wasted on overheads and bricks and
mortar. 'Schemes that looked attractive in the 80s might not correspond with
the changing pattern of demography in the 90s.' Benefit cheats cost Britain
the equivalent of three new hospitals a year according to a Department of
Social Security fraud investigator. Mr Gareth Lewis of the department's
organised fraud division made the comment on BBC TV's Inside Story, to be
shown tonight.
He said benefit had to be accessible to give the 21m claimants easy access
to it. 'If someone wants to get into it and defraud it, it is therefore
easier for that person to do so.'

FT  29 SEP 93 / BCCI official sentenced to six years for fraud
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR SYED ALI AKBAR, the former Bank of Credit and Commerce International
official who admitted frauds involving more than Dollars 745m connected with
the bank's collapse, was yesterday sentenced to six years in prison.
However the former head of BCCI's treasury division is likely to be released
after serving only 12 to 18 months. Mr Justice Scott, at the Old Bailey,
ordered that the two years he had already spent in French and British jails
be taken into account.
The judge also told Mr Akbar that he was reducing his sentence considerably
following the banker's decision to co-operate with Serious Fraud Office
investigators and to plead guilty to 16 charges of false accounting. This
meant the prospect of another enormously expensive 'mega-trial' had been
avoided, he said.
If Mr Akbar had been convicted after pleading innocent he could have
expected a sentence of between 10 and 11 years. Mr Justice Scott told him:
'You have pleaded guilty to an international fraud on a massive scale
between 1982 and 1986. You were the chief architect of the bogus deployment
of millions and millions and millions of dollars.'
Mr Akbar was not responsible for all BCCI's financial problems but the
bank's eventual collapse cast a shadow over the whole banking world, he
said.
'The losers included not only the big battalions of banks, insurance
companies and local authorities but individuals and small businesses, and
for some of them the loss was fatal - that's what makes it so serious.'
Although Mr Akbar stands to be released from prison after 12 to 18 months,
it is likely he will be immediately re-arrested and made to face further
charges in the US. He has already been indicted in Tampa, Florida, over
allegations that he laundered money stolen from the Panamanian National
Guard by the country's former head of state, President Noriega.
The judge said Mr Akbar had personally gained or misused Dollars 61m of BCCI
depositors' funds - money which he used to set up Capcom, a futures dealing
company which handled most of the bank's dealing business.
Investigations were unable to establish whether Mr Akbar had hidden any
money for future use. According to Capcom records, all money was lost
through Mr Akbar's unsuccessful dealing.

FT  29 SEP 93 / Thatcher fires a warning shot
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BARONESS THATCHER has granted an interview to a Sunday newspaper in a move
timed to cause maximum discomfort to the Tory leadership ahead of next
week's annual conference in Blackpool.
The interview, which is expected to be published in the next Sunday Times,
follows Lady Thatcher's inflammatory remarks on the government's tax and
European policy during a private dinner attended by Tory activists on Monday
night.
At last year's conference, the former prime minister used an article in The
European newspaper to launch a vitriolic attack on the Maastricht treaty in
a move which shattered Mr John Major's hopes that divisions over Europe had
been put to rest.
The Sunday Times is also serialising Lady Thatcher's forthcoming memoirs but
will not start publishing extracts until after the conference, in accordance
with the conditions of its serialisation contract.
Lady Thatcher's outburst on Monday - in which she criticised the
government's plans to extend VAT to domestic fuel - reopened Tory divisions
over the proposals and undermined the party leadership's hopes of a quiet
week in the run-up to the conference. In a wide-ranging speech to party
activists in Southend, she warned it would be very damaging for the Tories
to become known as the high-tax party.
Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, said he strongly agreed with
Lady Thatcher's emphasis on the need to 'get the nation's finances right'.
He added: 'I do not like putting VAT on fuel. We have, nevertheless, to get
some revenue. If we do not get this revenue here, we would have to get the
money from somewhere else.'
Mr William Powell, MP for Corby and one of two Tory MPs who voted against
the plan, said he was 'glad' Lady Thatcher had spoken out. But he doubted
whether Mr Major would pay much attention.
Sir Marcus Fox, chairman of the influential 1922 committee of Conservative
backbenchers, said there was 'enormous sympathy' for the views she
expressed. But 'we must leave every option open in dealing with this massive
deficit or we cannot look forward to a prosperous future.'
Mr Peter Temple-Morris, Tory MP for Leominster, said the speech was 'frankly
not quite the behaviour we expect from an ex-prime minister . . . a period
of restraint and a period of political dignity would not go amiss'.

FT  29 SEP 93 / Creditors of collapsed bank agree arrangement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CREDITORS OF Equatorial Bank, the small Asian-owned institution which was
placed into administration in March, have agreed a voluntary arrangement, it
emerged last night.
The agreement was reached at a creditors' meeting yesterday and then
ratified by an extraordinary general meeting of the bank.
The creditors' voluntary arrangement paves the way for payment of a first
dividend of 20p in the pound by the end of the first week in November, the
administrators said. They warned that creditors were unlikely ultimately to
be paid in full.
Mr Gareth Hughes and Ms Maggie Mills, the administrators from accountants
Ernst &amp; Young, said liquid assets of the bank were Pounds 12.3m at the end
of last month.
That had increased from Pounds 5.1m in March as a result of Pounds 6.1m in
amounts recovered from loans and advances made to customers, and Pounds 1.1m
in tax repayments. They said Equatorial's trade finance obligations had been
reduced to Pounds 2.8m.
The bank's loan book net of provisions was Pounds 31m at the end of August.
The administrators said they were beginning legal proceedings to recover
outstanding amounts due.
They said they were continuing to negotiate with interested parties on 'the
possibility of a rescue', but stressed that this was unlikely.

FT  29 SEP 93 / Barclaycard to shed 400 jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BARCLAYCARD yesterday announced the loss of 400 jobs, representing 8 per
cent of its workforce.
About 350 jobs will be lost at the credit card company's headquarters in
Northampton and the remaining 50 will be cut from regional offices.
The job losses will be among staff in personnel, finance, marketing and
administration and result from a review of the company's overheads cost
structure undertaken in April.
Barclaycard said it aimed to make the cuts through voluntary redundancies,
but it could not rule out compulsory measures.
Mr Richard Reay-Smith, chief executive, said that costs had to be reduced
'to secure the future of Barclaycard and preserve jobs in the long term'.
The company said its operating costs were higher than those of some
competitors.
Mr Rob MacGregor of Bifu, the finance union, said: 'There can be no
justification for these job losses whatsoever.' He added that 1993 looked
likely to produce record-breaking profits for the company.
Barclays Bank, which does not break down the accounts of its credit card
arm, reported a doubling of profits from Pounds 55m to Pounds 112m in the UK
banking division's central retail services business - which includes
Barclaycard - for last year, amid pre-tax losses of Pounds 242m.
In August this year, Barclays reported interim pre-tax profits of Pounds
335m and said that Barclaycard had improved 'substantially'.

electricity pool over proposed reforms which they believe will be
ineffective in bringing down electricity prices.
The Energy Intensive Users Group yesterday claimed that its members'
interests had not been properly represented in the August poll. The pool had
agreed changes in bidding procedures which it said could bring prices down
by between 1.5 per cent and 3 per cent.

<TEXT>
THE FUTURE of IBM Havant in Hampshire, one of four large European
manufacturing plants threatened with closure earlier this year by the
computer giant, looks secure for the foreseeable future, Alan Cane writes.
Western Digital Corporation, a large US-based computer memory manufacturer,
yesterday said it had placed a contract with Havant for the assembly,
testing and packaging of its most popular personal computer disk drives.
Mr Ken Wilkie, IBM Havant chief executive, said the deal secured Havant's
future and the jobs of its 2,000 workforce. He believed, however, that
Havant would have been safe even without the order. The plant was also
building drives for IBM and special electronic circuitry for other
manufacturers.
Mr Charles Haggerty, Western Digital's chairman, president and chief
executive, said the deal would provide the company with a European source of
drives.
The Havant contract is initially for 18 months and Western Digital envisages
Havant producing 400,000 disc drives a year. The drives will go to customers
throughout Europe. Last year the company's European subsidiary shipped about
a million disk drives.

FT  29 SEP 93 / Directors warn tax rise could harm recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ARGUMENTS against tax rises in the November 30 Budget strengthened
yesterday when the Institute of Directors and the Confederation of British
Industry said higher taxes could harm the recovery.
The comments add up to the sternest warnings yet that the upturn could be
jeopardised by any extra taxes in the next financial year on top of the
Pounds 6.7bn already announced.
The institute and the CBI are trying to persuade Mr Kenneth Clarke, the
chancellor, to emphasise cuts in public spending in his effort to reduce the
growing gap between state expenditure and revenues. The warnings underline
anxiety that, despite promising growth in the first half of the year, the
economy could sag over the next few months because of weak export demand and
sluggish consumer spending.
Mr Peter Morgan, director-general of the institute, said recovery was
'uncertain'. Launching a package of policy ideas for the Budget, Mr Morgan
said: 'We may need the consumer to come to the rescue (of the upturn). We
certainly don't need any tax rises.'
Mr Sudhir Junankar, CBI deputy head of economics, told a London conference:
'There is a risk that further tax rises may hit consumers and business
confidence and hamper the pace of the recovery we expect over the year
ahead.' He added that many people had yet to adjust to the tax increases
pencilled in for next April. 'The government must avoid complacency and not
take for granted the recovery that is now under way.'
The institute is meeting Mr Clarke next month to press its suggestions for
the Budget. Rather than tax increases - being considered by the Treasury as
a way to reduce public borrowing, which is forecast to reach Pounds 50bn
this financial year - the institute wants the chancellor to reduce public
spending by Pounds 9bn in 1994-95 and Pounds 20bn the year after.
Mr Morgan said the spending cut for next year, from the planned level of
Pounds 296bn, could be achieved by relatively modest measures. These include
more contracting out of government services and tight controls on pay and
welfare spending.
Although the chancellor has indicated that he will keep next year's spending
at planned levels, Mr Morgan said he hoped to persuade the chancellor to
'revisit' the arguments. The institute also wants to see tax cuts of Pounds
1.3bn from next April in areas such as help for companies on business rates,
tax relief for individuals sending their children to private schools, and
reductions in inheritance tax.
The Engineering Employers' Federation yesterday urged Mr Clarke to announce
in the Budget an increase in tax allowances on investment from 25 per cent
to 100 per cent. It said this would lay the foundations for a 'lasting
recovery' by increasing industry's growth potential.

<TEXT>
MR PAUL CONDON, the Metropolitan Police Commissioner, yesterday launched a
policing charter setting out service targets for London's police service,
John Willman writes.
The charter's launch was overshadowed by allegations of police corruption
broadcast by BBC TV's Panorama programme on Monday. Three police officers
have been arrested and an inquiry is under way into the allegations.
Among the targets in the charter is a promise that the police will arrive at
urgent incidents within 12 minutes. The performance of each police station
against the targets will be published every three months.
Mr Condon said the charter reflected what Londoners had told the service
they wanted.

FT  29 SEP 93 / World Trade News: Pharmaceuticals groups warned on R&amp;D
spending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE world's pharmaceuticals industry will be unable to sustain its high
levels of spending on research and development. Recent government measures
to restrain healthcare spending mean the drugs market will grow
insufficiently quickly to provide a reasonable return on the Dollars 30bn
(Pounds 19.8bn) a year presently being spent on pharmaceuticals R&amp;D,
according to Prof Jurgen Drews, president of international R&amp;D at Roche, the
Swiss healthcare group.
Professor Drews said global prescription sales would need to reach about
Dollars 280bn a year within 10 years to justify present R&amp;D spending.
'Given growing containment on healthcare budgets around the globe, the
chances of reaching the Dollars 280bn figure are more than low - they are
non-existent. The industry has clearly been overspending,' warned Prof
Drews.
The sector faced a period of consolidation and contraction. R&amp;D spending
would have to contract as well, he added. Dr Armin Kessler, chief operating
officer, said he expected further mergers to occur over the coming years as
drugs groups struggled to cope with the new environment.
The warning came as Roche, which spends SFr1.5bn (Pounds 697m) a year on
pharmaceuticals R&amp;D and is one of the world's largest R&amp;D investors, said it
would slow its spending in the area. Roche's pharmaceuticals operations,
which include a 60 per cent stake in the US biotechnology group Genentech,
spends about 24 per cent of turnover on R&amp;D.
Prof Drews said a level of 17 per cent to 18 per cent would be preferable.
Genentech's R&amp;D investment would fall from about 50 per cent of sales to 24
per cent within five years, he added.
Roche would achieve its target not by cutting R&amp;D spending, but by ensuring
sales increased faster than expenditure, stressed Prof Drews.
'Those companies that are innovative will survive,' he said. 'We will manage
our projects vigorously and become more efficient. We will also set up
strategic networks between academic organisations, biotechnology groups and
ourselves to ensure access to the rapid scientific advances that will offer
us novel, worthwhile treatment.'

FT  29 SEP 93 / World Trade News: US accused of 'foul play' in Gatt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   LONDON, PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPE's three leading aerospace companies - British Aerospace (BAe),
Aerospatiale of France and Deutsche Aerospace (Dasa) - yesterday accused the
US of foul play by attempting to use current international trade
negotiations to undermine the Gatt subsidies agreement for large civil
aircraft.
The European manufacturers, all partners in the Airbus consortium, said they
had become increasingly concerned by US efforts to include civil aircraft
subsidies into the broader subsidies code to be adopted in the Gatt Uruguay
Round trade package.
'By attempting to lump the existing sectoral agreement for aircraft
subsidies into the Uruguay Round, the US is attempting to get the issue lost
amid all the debate on subsidies to other industrial and agricultural
sectors,' said Mr Syd Gillibrand, BAe deputy chairman and president of the
European aerospace industry trade association.
European companies fear the EC may be prepared to trade off the interests of
the aerospace industry for a compromise with the US on farm subsidies.
'Important as agriculture is, you are also talking about the survival of
European high-technology and aerospace capabilities,' Mr Gillibrand said.
The three companies said in a joint statement that the European aircraft
industry currently employed directly 400,000 people and provided work
indirectly for more than 1m.
European manufacturers also claimed the US was 'back-peddling' on last
year's Gatt civil aircraft agreement between the US and the EC reached after
more than five years of negotiations. Under the pact, the EC agreed on a 33
per cent ceiling on direct subsidies for new aircraft development programmes
in return for a limit on indirect government support for civil aerospace
projects based on 3 per cent of an individual company's annual sales or 4
per cent of the country's civil aerospace industry turnover.
European companies accused the US of seeking to impose even tougher limits
on direct subsidies while maintaining indirect support through government
agencies for civil aircraft programmes. EC companies have traditionally
relied on direct supports while US rivals Boeing and McDonnell Douglas have
relied essentially on indirect support mechanisms.
There was evidence the US government was planning a sharp increase in
support for aeronautical research and development. Nasa's aeronautics budget
would increase by about 60 per cent over two years and already exceeded
Dollars 1bn (Pounds 660m) a year, the three companies said.
'All the evidence is the US is showing bad faith on the non implementation
of the indirect subsidies part of the Gatt aircraft agreement,' Mr
Gillibrand said. By attempting to move the current aircraft sectoral trade
agreement into the general Gatt subsidies code, the US was seeking to
tighten the ceiling on direct subsidies from 33 per cent to 20 per cent for
new aircraft programmes without facing similar restrictions on indirect
supports.

PILLSBURY, the US subsidiary of UK food, drinks and retailing group Grand
Metropolitan, announced yesterday the creation of a joint venture with
Foodcorp of Johannesburg to manufacture and sell Pillsbury products in
southern Africa.
The announcement of the agreement, the terms of which were not disclosed,
came just three days after Mr Nelson Mandela, president of the African
National Congress, called for the removal of all remaining economic
sanctions against South Africa.
Former President Bush lifted federal restrictions against investing in South
Africa in 1991, but many state and city governments across the US maintain
some form of sanctions against the country.
Pillsbury said it would form the new company, called Pillsbury Africa with
Foodcorp's Table Top unit, South Africa's leading branded vegetable business
and the top producer of frozen vegetables.
The joint venture will manufacture Pillsbury's green giant vegetable
products and Pillsbury baked goods at Table Top's plants in the cities of
George and Port Elizabeth in the eastern Cape province. A 'significant'
number of local jobs would be created over the next three years, said
Pillsbury. The US group said it hoped the venture would provide a
springboard into other African markets.

FT  29 SEP 93 / World Trade News: Tokyo diners spawn Malaysia eel industry -
A Taiwanese enterprise feeding off Asian tastes and talents
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE are few things Japanese enjoy more than sinking their teeth into a
succulent chunk of eel.
Grilled eel, or edomae unagi, is regarded as a great delicacy, especially
during the summer months when a good lashing of eel is believed to cool down
the body, exercise the digestion and improve sexual performance.
On average Japan consumes about 110,000 tonnes of eel a year. With scarce
land resources and expensive labour, Japan relies mainly on imports to meet
its seemingly insatiable eel appetite.
That is where Malaysia comes in. On the east coast of Peninsular Malaysia
the world's biggest eel farm has been built, covering a total of 5,000
acres.
At any one time between 30m and 40m eels are swimming about in the farm's
400 ponds. When a second phase of work is completed on the project, the eel
population will double. All production is cooked and packaged on site and
exported to Japan, ready for the restaurant table.
'Eels are sensitive creatures and they have to be looked after very
carefully,' says Mr Felix Lo, director of the eel farm in rural Pahang
state. 'That's why they are so expensive. In a Tokyo restaurant you can
quite easily pay Y3,000 (Pounds 18) for a good piece of eel.'
The Malaysia farm is run by Song Cheng Enterprises, a private Taiwanese
company. The Taiwanese, taught originally by the Japanese, have become the
world's premier eel farmers.
Eel production at the Malaysian farm started three years ago after the
failure of a prawn farming project. Mr Lo says about 4,000 tonnes of eel -
worth nearly Dollars 70m (Pounds 45.4m) - will be exported this year, rising
to about 10,000 tonnes by 1995.
'There are between three and six eels, each about 15 inches long, in every
kilo,' says Mr Lo. 'Each kilo sells for between Dollars 15 and Dollars 20.
It can be a very lucrative business but if you're not careful things can go
badly wrong.'
Despite exhaustive research, scientists have so far failed to hatch eel eggs
under laboratory conditions. The species favoured by the Japanese - the
'Japonica' eel - is found in fresh water in Taiwan, Korea, China and Japan.
At a certain stage the eel swims to sea to lay its eggs. When hatched, the
eel fries make their way to fresh water.
Song Cheng buys its eel fries from farmers who gather them in river mouths
round the coast of north-east Asia. The eels, fed a mainly fishmeal diet,
take up to two years to mature ready for processing and export. Every part
of the eel is used. The head is chopped off and recycled into fishmeal. The
backbone is crushed to extract oil which is processed into tablets. 'Many
people say eel tablets improve the condition of the skin,' says Mr Lo. 'We
sell them as the 'cosmetic you can eat'.'
The Song Cheng farm employs 1,500 people in an area where jobs are scarce.
Nearly Dollars 100m has been invested in the project so far. A similar
amount, much of it borrowed from local banks, is to be invested in the next
phase of the farm's expansion.
Not everyone is happy with the project. The farm has been treated generously
by the Malaysian government with handsome tax concessions, including a tax
holiday for at least the first five years of operation.
While Song Cheng pays an undisclosed amount to the local government in
return for a 90-year lease on its vast land holding, critics say Malaysia
sees little financial return on the project. Nor does Malaysia gain much in
the way of technology transfer: most of the important tasks at the farm are
carried out by Taiwanese, Japanese and Koreans.
But the main criticism of the eel farm is on environmental grounds. Eels
need a constant supply of fresh water and environmentalists say important
coastal swamplands are being dried out by excessive pumping. They say the
Taiwanese are carrying out activities in Malaysia which are no longer
allowed in Taiwan.
The Malaysian government allowed Song Cheng to dredge up tons of sand from
the seashore to build dikes for the eel ponds. Locals say salt water is
killing off nearby grasslands and worry what will happen to the area when
the eel farm eventually closes.
Song Cheng insists that it, and its eels, are in Malaysia to stay and says
the criticisms of the environmentalists are not justified. 'We have the most
to lose if we damage the environment because it means our eels will no
longer be able to survive,' says Mr Lo. 'Anyway, we have created hundreds of
jobs - that's a very important factor.'
Song Cheng says it cannot fatten up its eels fast enough. 'The supply of
eels to Japan still falls well short of demand,' says Mr Lo. 'People wonder
whether Japanese tastes are changing. But expecting the Japanese to give up
eating eels is like saying the Chinese will stop eating rice.'

FT  29 SEP 93 / Clinton appeals for UN to step up Somalia efforts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton yesterday called on the United Nations to step up its
efforts to create a new government in Somalia so that the troops in the
multinational peacekeeping force could leave, writes George Graham.
'There has to be a political strategy that puts the affairs of Somalia back
into the hands of Somalis,' he said before a meeting with congressional
leaders, who expressed concern about the continued US involvement in
Somalia.
'We were not asked to go to Somalia to establish a protectorate, or a trust
relationship, or to run the country,' Mr Clinton said.
'That's not what we went for.'
Members of the US Congress have become increasingly sensitive about the
Somali peacekeeping operation since the killing on Saturday of three US
soldiers in Mogadishu, and the Senate has passed a resolution calling on Mr
Clinton to seek congressional approval by November 15 for keeping US troops
there.
Somalia has also loomed ominously in congressional discussions on the
possibility of sending up to 25,000 US troops to Bosnia to enforce an
eventual peace settlement.
But Mr Tom Foley, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, sought to
minimise the significance of the battle the UN faces in its pursuit of
General Mohammed Farah Aideed, a Somali warlord.
'That's in one part of Mogadishu, in southern Mogadishu,' said Mr Foley
after the White House meeting.
'In other parts of the country village elders are taking over responsibility
for governing the country, people are being fed, crops are being planted,'
he said.
Earlier this week, in a speech to the UN General Assembly, Mr Clinton said
the US would ask hard questions before getting involved in future
peacekeeping operations.
The US will send 600 troops to Haiti from next week to help peaceful
transition to a democratic government there, the Defence Department said
yesterday, Reuter reports from Washington. The Pentagon said the troops,
including engineers, doctors and military trainers, were part of a six-month
UN operation backing the restoration of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide to
power on October 30, and 'will be fulfilling a non-confrontational role'.

FT  29 SEP 93 / Britain urges UN to update peacekeeping role
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN DAVIDSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN yesterday called for far-reaching reforms of United Nations
operations, to make its role more effective in combating international
conflict and disorder.
Speaking to the UN General Assembly, Mr Douglas Hurd, UK foreign secretary,
urged wide-ranging modernisation of the UN approach to peacekeeping. He
suggested that certain countries with well trained, equipped and available
forces might be asked to be ready to provide the first wave of a
peacekeeping force, giving other countries time to train and equip follow-up
forces.
But the corollary of early deployment by some countries must also be that
they would end their deployment early, he insisted. 'A commitment to deploy
early would of course need to be matched by a UN commitment to agree a firm
end-date for the deployment. Exits are as important as entrances,' he said.
Mr Hurd also recommended that many peacekeeping operations might be run more
effectively by regional organisations or even by single countries on behalf
of the UN.
He repeatedly stressed there were bound to be quite finite limits to what
the UN could do in the peacekeeping field, and he called for greater efforts
to ward off impending conflicts by preventive diplomacy.
Only the UN, he said, had the legal powers to act for the maintenance of
world peace, and it could be helped to improve its record. But he warned it
could not guarantee solutions to civil wars, 'nor even to that pernicious
variant of a civil war which we see today in Bosnia'.
Mr Hurd's insistence that the UN must be clear on its objectives before
launching peacekeeping operations echoed remarks on Monday by President Bill
Clinton.
'Any operation must have clear and achievable objectives, linked to a
political process which offers reasonable hope of a solution and to which
all parties should be committed. The mandate must be precise and finite.
That means the Security Council must resist the temptation to become
involved in the detailed conduct of operations.
'Where the UN is charged with executing as well as authorising a
peacekeeping operation, all aspects of it should be handled by a single
department in New York. That is why we have suggested the creation of an
expanded Planning and Operations Staff for Peacekeeping'.
In a reference to large arrears owed by the US to the UN, Mr Hurd urged all
countries to pay their contributions in full and promptly.
Moscow has called on the UN for an offical mandate to justify Russian
peacekeeping operations in the neighbouring countries of the former Soviet
Union, and appealed for voluntary contributions from other countries to help
finance these operations.
Speaking to the UN General Assembly, Mr Andrei Kozyrev, Russian foreign
minister, made a renewed attempt to counter international reproaches over
Russia's UN contribution arrears: Dollars 261m (Pounds 169.4m) for
peacekeeping, and Dollars 81m on the regular budget.
He said the international community should recognise that Russia had a
legitimate interventionist role in its region.

THE International Monetary Fund and World Bank are never so happy as when
producing acronyms.
But during this week's IMF and World Bank annual meetings, one choice
specimen - ESAF, standing for the Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility -
has been cropping up in speeches and conversations more than most.
Through ESAF the IMF offers credits at concessional interest rates to some
of the poorest developing nations, provided they carry out Fund-supervised
economic reform programmes. Some 73 countries are eligible for the 0.5 per
cent credits, which are paid back in up to 10 years.
Since the late 1980s, about Dollars 5.6bn (Pounds 3.63bn) has been
channelled to 42 countries under ESAF and its predecessor, the structural
adjustment facility.
ESAF is generally considered a success. An IMF study of 19 recipient
countries found that their annual growth rates rose from 2 per cent to 3 per
cent after ESAF finance and reform programmes. Average export volume growth
rose to about 7 per cent from 2 per cent. Official reserves rose markedly
and average inflation, although still high and in double digits, fell by
about a fifth.
But ESAF expires in November. Unless a successor is agreed, developing
countries will lose an important source of finance. The IMF's problem is the
deadline comes when many industrial country members are strapped for cash.
The Fund wants to set up a new facility which can lend SDR 5bn (Pounds
4.66bn) over three years. But this sum, while large, is not very contentious
because it is provided in loans from industrial countries at market related
interest rates.
The money required for interest rate subsidies goes into a separate account,
is substantial and is charged to the budgets of countries that provide it.
With aid budgets under pressure, countries are thinking twice about their
contributions. Because ESAF loans have long repayment periods, the IMF
estimates SDR 2.lbn will be needed.
The IMF's industrial country members say they want a new ESAF. But comments
this week by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the UK chancellor of the exchequer, that
Britain was unlikely to contribute to the new ESAF are a measure of the
difficulties confronting Mr Michel Camdessus, the IMF managing director, in
drumming up finance for the facility.
Britain has been a generous supplier of funds to finance interest rate
subsidies in the existing ESAF. By the end of the IMF's last financial year
on April 30, some SDR 2.54bn were pledged to the ESAF subsidy account by 24
mainly industrial nations. The UK share, at SDR 361m, was well over 10 per
cent. Only Japan and France promised more.
Both Japan and France have said that they will contribute to the new
facility.
Mr Hirohisa Fujii, the Japanese finance minister, announced that Japan was
ready to provide an amount 'comparable' to its existing contributions. Japan
has lent SDR 2.2bn at market rates towards the capital of the existing ESAF
and has pledged SDR 393m in interest subsidies.
Mr Edmond Alphandery, the French finance minister, has said that France will
provide 15 per cent of the capital to the new facility, a sum roughly in
line with the SDR 800m lent at present to the ESAF capital account at market
rates.
Mr Alphandery also said France would provide funds for the subsidised
interest rates so long as an equitable burden sharing could be arranged.
The UK is pushing for more generous relief of official debt to ease the
plight of the poorest developing countries.
But the chancellor's threat to cease contributions to the ESAF subsidy
account raises the prospect of a burden sharing row.
Germany is also reluctant to dig into its coffers for ESAF. Mr Theo Waigel,
the finance minister, said he had 'only very limited possibilities' because
of budget constraints.
Various ideas have been put forward for plugging the gap. Mr Clarke has
exhumed a proposal advanced by Mr Norman Lamont, his predecessor, the IMF
should sell some gold to finance ESAF.
But this commands little support.
The IMF has done its bit. It reduced the estimated capital needs of the new
ESAF to SDR 5bn from SDR 6bn. Mr Camdessus has offered to provide SDR
500m-SDR 600m from IMF resources for the subsidy account in a move that
would reduce its financing requirement to about SDR 1.5bn.
With the deadline still two months away, some brinkmanship over ESAF is
inevitable.
Mr Clarke is certainly in a good position to fend off supplicants for
renewed UK support because UK government spending plans for the years ahead
are still being decided ahead of the November 30 budget.
But the betting is still against an outcome in which ESAF would die. 'There
will be some squabbling,' a senior official from the Group of Seven leading
industrial countries predicted. 'But we will get it done. . .in enough time
so that there won't be any interruption in the IMF's capacity to support
Africa.'

FT  29 SEP 93 / Leading senator to stand down
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SENATOR Donald Riegle of Michigan, chairman of the Senate banking committee,
announced yesterday he would not seek re-election next year. Mr Riegle is
the sixth senator standing down in 1994, and the third to fall victim at
least in part to financial scandal.
His departure is expected to bring Senator Paul Sarbanes of Maryland, until
now most active in budget and economic policy, to the banking committee
chairmanship.
Like Senator Dennis DeConcini of Arizona, who announced his retirement
earlier this month, Mr Riegle was one of the 'Keating Five' linked to Mr
Charles Keating, head of Lincoln Savings and Loan whose bankruptcy cost the
government more than Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.2bn).
Although the Michigan state Democratic party has rallied behind Mr Riegle,
his withdrawal will cause some relief.
The likely Republican candidate, Mr Spencer Abraham, once an aide to former
Vice-President Dan Quayle, is an astute though uncharismatic politician who
is expected to mount a strong campaign.
With 34 Senate seats up for re-election in 1994 - 21 of them held by
Democrats - Republicans have a sporting chance of reclaiming the Senate
majority they lost in 1986.

FT  29 SEP 93 / Camdessus calls for refocusing of economic policies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Michel Camdessus, managing director of the International Monetary Fund,
yesterday called on the industrialised countries 'to refocus boldly' their
economic policies to strengthen growth and employment.
Spelling out the latest IMF doctrine for its 178 members from the
industrialised, developing and former communist worlds, Mr Camdessus warned
that global economic problems were formidable but 'opportunities are in some
respects unprecedented'.
In his speech at the formal opening of the annual meetings of the IMF and
World Bank, Mr Camdessus said globalised financial markets would not
tolerate imbalances in the mix or stance of macroeconomic policy or
inconsistencies between exchange rates and fundamentals.
Warning that 'business as usual' would not solve the profound changes
brought about by globalisation of the world economy, he urged:
More liberal trade. Successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round of trade
liberalisation talks was an 'opportunity governments cannot allow themselves
to miss'. More developing IMF countries should liberalise exchange controls.
Structural reform. A key mistake of the 1980s was the failure to realise
that rising unemployment was a result of factors apart from the ups and
downs of the business cycle.
'Part of the problem is that our well-meaning efforts to protect the
unemployed and people in insecure and low-paid jobs have actually been
adding to labour market rigidities,' he said. 'I believe there is increasing
recognition of the need to reform social insurance schemes, to promote job
search and wage flexibility, to limit taxes and regulations that discourage
employment and at the same time devote more resources to education and
training.'
Lower budget deficits. Apart from Japan, countries had lost the ability to
use fiscal policy to support demand. Deficit cutting plans by the US,
Germany, Italy and Canada did not go far enough. Nearly all industrial
countries should draw up stronger medium-term deficit-cutting plans and
introduce them as recovery strengthened. They should cut subsidies and
excessive military spending.
Cutting interest rates. In Europe lower interest rates could ease stagnation
and unemployment. 'Continuing decline of inflationary pressures in Germany,
as well as further fiscal consolidation, promise relief.'
Mr Camdessus also called for a strengthening of the international monetary
system through closer policy co-ordination among the Group of Seven
industrialised countries and strengthened policy surveillance by the IMF.
Progress to European monetary union should be encouraged. Widening bands in
the European exchange rate mechanism should help recovery but 'it also
entails a risk of a relaxation of discipline. This must be resisted by a
major effort at policy convergence.'
Developing nations should follow the example of fast-growing countries by
adopting sound macroeconomic policies, liberal trade policies and stamping
out corruption.
Mr Camdessus said the world faced daunting problems. Industrial countries
had to contend with unemployment, anaemic growth and budget deficits.
Poverty still afflicted 'hundreds of millions' in developing nations,
despite strong growth in some countries.
But there were some hopeful signs. The world monetary and financial
situation had 'significantly improved'. Inflation in the industrial world
remained subdued, increasing the scope for lower interest rates. Currencies
were not seriously misaligned. The debt crisis had receded as a threat.
Strong growth in developing countries had supported global trade and growth.
Among former communist countries, Albania, the Czech Republic, Estonia,
Poland and Slovenia were expected to show positive growth this year.
Global economic co-operation was improving as shown by policy changes since
the spring meetings of the IMF. In that period, the US and Germany had
adopted budget consolidation measures, Japan had taken steps to boost its
economy and interest rates had fallen in Europe.

A NATURAL gas pipeline exploded along a busy highway near Caracas yesterday,
killing at least 51 people and injuring 15 while they sat in morning rush
hour traffic, the Venezuelan National Guard said, Reuter reports from
Caracas.
National Guard Commander Vinicio Barrios, appearing yards from the charred
wreckage of vehicles, told reporters that rescue workers counted 51 dead and
15 injured.
The toll included 33 people incinerated in a bus that was stuck in traffic
next to the pipeline that blew up about 40 miles west of Caracas, Miranda
state civil defence official Cesar Leon said.
'The blast occurred over an area of 200 yards,' Mr Leon said. 'All of the
people who were in this perimeter died instantly.'
Construction crews using heavy machinery to dig up the ground accidentally
struck the pipeline, causing a leak, according to one firefighter.
Corpoven, the affiliate of state-run oil company Petroleos de Venezuela,
said safety valves immediately shut gas through the line, preventing further
damage. However, nearby homes were evacuated for fear of further explosions.
Earlier officials had said the blast was the result of a crash between a car
and a truck that had skidded into the pipeline.

FT  29 SEP 93 / Hillary steps up campaign on healthcare
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THERE WAS no apple pie but a whole lot of motherhood yesterday as Mrs
Hillary Rodham Clinton took the administration's campaign for healthcare
reform to the committee rooms of Congress, writes George Graham in
Washington.
Speaking 'as a mother, a wife, a daughter, a sister, a woman,' Mrs Clinton
urged members of Congress to 'craft the most important social policy that
our nation will have confronted in many decades.'
But members of the House Ways and Means committee, the scene of yesterday's
hearings, have mothers too, and they wanted more reassurance.
'My reference is my mom, and she's concerned that you want to cut two
hundred billion bucks out of Medicare,' said Mr Pete Stark, a California
Democrat who is a staunch defender of the government-run Medicare programme
which finances healthcare for the elderly.
Mrs Clinton was not to be outmothered, however.
'I have a mother too, Mr Stark, so if we can't pass the mother test we are
not going to be able to succeed, are we?' she retorted.
The administration is expected to take another two to three weeks to produce
detailed legislative plans for the reforms outlined by President Bill
Clinton in a speech to both houses of Congress last week, so Mrs Clinton
stuck to generalities in her opening statement yesterday. But in answering
questions from members she had to tackle a clear current of concern, even
among Democrats, about the effects of the administration's proposals on
small businesses.
Mrs Clinton firmly defended the administration's proposal to require all
employers to provide health insurance to their workers and pay for most of
the premium, a proposal that has provoked apocalyptic warnings of massive
firings in small businesses in the US.
'It doesn't strike us as fair that those businesses that have made the
commitment to healthcare should not only bear the burden for their own
employees but literally the burden of the employees of others who have not
made the same choice,' she said.
This proposal is expected to be one of the most controversial in the debate
on healthcare legislation.

FT  29 SEP 93 / World Bank ready to help peace process
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE World Bank is ready to move ahead with economic help for the
Israeli-occupied territories, South Africa and Vietnam, Mr Lewis Preston,
the bank's president, said yesterday, writes Peter Norman.
Declaring that 'we are well prepared to invest in peace,' Mr Preston said
the bank had been working 'over the last several years' with all parties in
South Africa to help draw up an economic support programme. The bank had
been working on policies for the occupied territories over the past year.
Speaking at the opening of the IMF and World Bank annual meetings, he said
that the world was changing faster than at any time since the second world
war and the bank was having to change too.
Developing countries had become a powerful force in the world economy.
In the past five years, they accounted for more than a quarter of the rise
in global imports.
They were expected to contribute about a third of the growth of world output
over the next five years. East Asia was 'positioned to become the world's
fourth major growth pole by the end of this decade'.
But their economies and problems were differentiated. Fast growth in east
Asia contrasted with persistently high levels of poverty in Africa.
To improve its effectiveness, the bank had:
Changed its organisational structure to focus on poverty reduction as its
main objective and rapidly increased its activities on the environment so
that environmental projects have become the fastest growing section of its
portfolio.
Boosted lending to the private sector and tripled over three years its
support for 'human resource development,' such as education.
Taken steps to improve the quality of its loan portfolio.
Expanded public access to its documents and set up an independent inspection
panel to strengthen accountability.

FT  29 SEP 93 / Argentina to pay overdue interest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER, Latin America Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ARGENTINA'S bank creditors will receive Dollars 700m (Pounds 454.5m) in cash
and Dollars 9bn in bonds by the end of next month in the last stage of the
restructuring accord between the government and international banks, writes
Stephen Fidler, Latin America Editor.
The payment will settle overdue interest dating back into the 1980s.
Problems in reconciling the ownership of the interest payments - caused by
active secondary market trading of the underlying loans and of the interest
payments themselves - led to a delay in the release of the bonds and cash.
Peru and its foreign bank creditors have scheduled a meeting for November 2
in New York to discuss debt restructuring. Bankers said prospects were good
that lawsuits against the government - in particular a suit by Chemical Bank
over a Dollars 20m loan to the now-defunct Compania Peruana de Vapores
repudiated in 1985 by President Alan Garcia's government - could be resolved
by November.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JORDAN will hold its first multi-party elections for parliament since 1956
as planned on November 8, Mr Abdul Salam al-Majali, prime minister, said
yesterday, writes James Whittington in Amman.
King Hussein had told foreign correspondents at a private dinner over the
weekend that 'there is a likelihood of a postponement for a limited period'
because he did not wish the election to become a referendum on the peace
deal between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation.
Mr Majali denied that there had been any change of tack but said the
government had listened to debate within the country and decided there was
no need for postponement. 'We had all sorts of calls from all sorts of
places but there's been no change from our side. Everything will be held on
time,' he told the Financial Times.
His comments, however, come as a surprise to most people in Amman, and
western diplomats voiced scepticism over whether the decision is final. 'The
king has been under a lot of pressure from those for and against having
elections on time and I don't think this is the last word,' said one.
The PLO-Israeli deal had thrown Jordan's election plans into a state of
confusion over whether hundreds of thousands of Palestinians would be
eligible to vote in July's elections in the occupied territories in addition
to the Jordanian poll.

WORKERS at foreign-funded factories in the Chinese port of Tianjin have gone
on strike over low pay and bad conditions at least 10 times this year,
according to an official newspaper, Reuter reports from Beijing.
The Beijing Youth News, in a rare report on labour unrest amid China's
economic boom, said the Tianjin strikes had hit mainly South Korean
enterprises, although one Japanese company was also affected. A spokesman at
the Tianjin Municipal Foreign Affairs Office confirmed he had heard of some
strikes but declined to provide detailed information.
The rash of strikes had prompted concern at high levels of the central
government, including a special study meeting at the Ministry of Labour, the
newspaper said.
It said one strike now under way 'is being handled by the relevant
authorities' but gave no details. It did not name any of the foreign
companies involved.
China has worked hard to play down the threat of strikes at its
foreign-funded factories, which have been among the best performers in the
economic upswing. Foreigners putting money into China have been promised a
compliant and nimble workforce and a government-controlled umbrella union.
A son of China's supreme leader Deng Xiaoping predicted yesterday his
father's policies would survive after his death because they represented the
wishes of China's population, AP reports from Beijing.
'I believe that China, under his leadership, has embarked on an irreversible
course of reform and opening up,' the Chinese leader's eldest son, Deng
Pufang, said at a news conference. His comments come soon after publication
of his sister's biography of their father - part of a campaign to glorify
the 89-year-old Deng and ensure his pragmatic modernisation policies survive
his death.
Asked about his father's health, he said: 'He is enjoying very good health.'

FT  29 SEP 93 / Worldwide probe makes slow progress - Andrew Jack and
Richard Donkin track global investigations into the collapsed bank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK and RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE sentencing yesterday of Mr Syed Ali Akbar, former head of treasury at
the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International, represents one of
the first prosecution victories in a series of criminal and civil court
cases related to the bank that are pending around the world.
Investigations across the globe have moved grindingly slowly since the
closure of the bank in July 1991 and have already led in the US to the
acquittal of Mr Robert Altman, a Washington lawyer accused of profiting from
loans given by BCCI to enable him to buy shares in First American, the bank
of which he was president.
The three main spheres of investigation are in the UK, US and Abu Dhabi.
The UK has three outstanding cases arising out of investigations by the
Serious Fraud Office. All the hearings are scheduled to begin in January.
They involve charges of false accounting against Mr Nazmudin Virani, former
chairman and chief executive of Control Securities, Mr Mohammed Abdul Baqi,
former managing director of Attock Oil, and Mr Imran Mohammed Ahmad Imam, an
assistant to Mr Swaleh Naqvi, BCCI's former chief executive.
The SFO has issued three arrest warrants in connection with the cases. The
warrants cover Mr Ghaith Pharaon, a former BCCI depositor, believed to be in
Morocco, Mr Mohammed Moizul Haque, a senior accounting officer at the bank,
and Mr Basheer Chowdry, BCCI's UK general manager. Mr Haque and Mr Chowdry
are thought to be living in Pakistan.
A number of indictments have been lodged in the US against BCCI officials
but Mr Robert Morgantheau, the New York district attorney who has been
spearheading investigations in the US, has had little success in bringing
any of those charged to justice.
Indictments were brought in the US in July last year for fraud, bribery,
conspiracy, larceny and racketeering related to BCCI against Mr Agha Hasan
Abedi, BCCI's ailing founder, Mr Naqvi and Mr Pharaon.
However, none of these men is likely to be extradited or to return to the US
while the charges remain.
A similar difficulty in relation to Mr Abedi faces prosecutors in Abu Dhabi,
the majority shareholder in BCCI, which brought charges against him last
month. He lives in Pakistan, and there is no extradition treaty between the
two countries.
More progress appears to have been made in Abu Dhabi which, after a two-year
investigation, has charged 13 senior BCCI officers, including Mr Naqvi, who
faces 36 years in jail if convicted on all counts. Preliminary hearings have
been set for October 9.
The criminal investigations are running parallel to a series of civil
actions launched by BCCI's liquidators on behalf of its creditors. On
October 27 the Touche Ross liquidator is hoping to secure final approval for
a joint compensation agreement with Abu Dhabi in which the emirate would
contribute between Dollars 1.2bn and Dollars 2.2bn (Pounds 1.42bn) in return
for the liquidators' sacrificing the right to sue it.
In the longer term three other legal actions launched by the liquidators
could generate billions of dollars. The first - unlikely to take place for
at least five years - was brought in London against accountants Price
Waterhouse and Ernst &amp; Whinney (the latter is now part of Ernst &amp; Young) as
auditors to BCCI.
The second, also brought in London, is against the Bank of England as lead
regulator to BCCI. More than 5,000 depositors have assigned their claims to
the liquidators, giving a strong mandate to proceed. The Bank has still to
serve its defence in the case.
The third, also to be heard in the UK, is against the National Commercial
Bank of Saudi Arabia and Sheikh Khalid bin Mahfouz, its former chief
operating officer.
Related court orders obtained by the liquidators in connection with
recoveries include a worldwide freeze on the assets of Sheikh Khalid and Mr
Haroon Rashid Khalon, a retired banker, granted by the High Court in London.
Separate legal action remains in the way of the liquidators. Three BCCI
depositors have appealed in Luxembourg against court approval of the
compensation agreement on the grounds that they believe Abu Dhabi should be
sued. A decision is expected at the end of October.
Meanwhile First American Bancshares, acquired by BCCI in contravention of US
law, in June became the first litigant to sue Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan
al-Nahyan, the ruler of Abu Dhabi. The Dollars 1.5bn suit alleges that the
leader and his government were to blame for the bank's failure as the
dominant and controlling shareholder since 1972.
Price Waterhouse faces two other civil suits. It is named as one of 77
defendants in a class action brought in California. The case was at first
dismissed and is now under appeal, with written pleadings complete and oral
hearings estimated to take place within five to 15 months.
It is also named in a case brought in London by two Omani depositors who
claimed they relied on the audited BCCI accounts to deposit Dollars 600,000
with the bank. Statements of claim have been issued.

FT  29 SEP 93 / Jordan to hold vote on time despite PLO-Israel deal

JORDAN will hold its first multi-party elections for parliament since 1956
as planned on 8 November, Mr Abdul Salam al-Majali, prime minister, said
yesterday.
King Hussein had told foreign correspondents at a private dinner over the
weekend that 'there is a likelihood of a postponement for a limited period
of time' because he did not wish the election to become a referendum on the
peace deal between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation.
Mr Majali denied that there had been any change of tack but said that the
government had listened to debate within the country and decided there was
no need for postponement. 'We had all sorts of calls from all sorts of
places but there's been no change from our side. Everything will be held on
time,' he told the Financial Times.
His comments, however, come as a surprise to most people in Amman, and
western diplomats voiced scepticism over whether the decision is final. 'The
king has been under a lot of pressure from those for and against having
elections on time and I don't think this is the last word,' said one.
The PLO-Israeli deal had thrown Jordan's election plans into a state of
confusion over whether hundreds of thousands of Palestinians would be
eligible to vote in July's elections in the occupied territories in addition
to the Jordanian poll.
The king had told the correspondents that he hoped Jordan's elections would
be held within 'a few months' or at the same time as elections under the
Palestinian-Israeli agreement.
Political parties welcomed the government's decision. 'It is good for our
democracy,' said one parliamentary candidate from the fundamentalist party,
the Islamic Action Front, which was against any postponment.

FT  29 SEP 93 / Demoralised Khmer Rouge out in the cold: The severely
weakened guerrilla group which claims to be 'tired of fighting'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE of the few decisive steps taken by the Khmer Rouge guerrilla group in
response to the momentous events in Cambodia this year has been to change
the code name of Pol Pot, the reclusive Khmer Rouge leader based on the Thai
border. Defectors say he is now known as '101'; before he was '87'.
The extreme left-wing organisation which executed and starved to death an
estimated 1m Cambodians during its time in power between 1975 and 1978 has
been severely weakened by the UN's Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.2bn) peacekeeping
mission and by the success of the UN-organised election in May.
Mr Hun Sen, one of two prime ministers, said yesterday the Khmer Rouge had
lost all political legitimacy and would be treated as outlaws, adding that
it was the government's 'legal right to wipe them out.'
Khmer Rouge leaders have repeatedly miscalculated since the Cambodian
factions, together with Asian and western nations, signed a comprehensive
set of peace accords in Paris two years ago.
After signing the peace plan, the Khmer Rouge sought to sabotage the
agreement by refusing to disarm its guerrillas and by attempting to disrupt
the election.
When sabotage failed, the Khmer Rouge demanded the right to be included in
the political process anyway, but it was too late: the government is now in
the hands of two of the other factions - the royalist Funcinpec party and
the Cambodian People's Party (CPP) - and the Khmer Rouge is out in the cold.
More than 1,300 front-line Khmer Rouge troops, representing about a 10th of
the organisation's fighting strength, have surrendered and defected to the
government since the election.
'We expected to achieve more, but the results didn't come. That's why we
decided to opt for peace,' said Mr Em Ngoun, a 36-year-old Khmer Rouge
colonel who surrendered in Kompong Chhnang on August 24 after more than two
decades of loyalty to Pol Pot.
As the highest-ranking cadre in central Cambodia to surrender, Mr Ngoun,
commander of a special mobile regiment, has provided invaluable information
to the outgoing UN Transitional Authority in Cambodia (Untac) and the
Cambodian government about the slump of Khmer Rouge morale.
In an interview at a government holding camp near the Cambodian capital
Phnom Penh, Mr Ngoun said of his Khmer Rouge colleagues remaining in the
jungle: 'All of them want to stop fighting.' He himself wanted 'to be a
normal person, to do some farming, because I hate war.'
Many of the defectors are suffering from malaria, and some have spoken of
food shortages; but such problems are common in rural Cambodia, and the
principal problem for the guerrillas appears to be the feeling that the
Khmer Rouge leadership is bankrupt of ideas.
After the election they were particularly demoralised to find that they were
under attack not only from the army of their old enemy, Mr Hun Sen's CPP
(installed by the Vietnamese invasion of 1978 which overthrew the Khmer
Rouge regime) but also from their former allies in Funcinpec and the Khmer
People's National Liberation Front.
Khmer Rouge propaganda proclaiming a war of liberation against the
Vietnamese occupiers was also wearing thin, partly because Untac radio was
audible throughout the country. The Vietnamese say they withdrew their last
troops in 1989, and many of the defectors said they had not seen any
Vietnamese troops for years.
In some areas, furthermore, Khmer Rouge fighters were running short of
ammunition.
Defectors have provided ample evidence that Thailand shamelessly flouted the
Paris peace accords by allowing the guerrillas to be resupplied from Thai
territory at least until February this year, but they also say the Thai
authorities have started to restrict supplies - and Khmer Rouge movements
inside Thailand - since the May election.
'The Khmer Rouge guerrillas are now facing their most serious political
crisis, because they are isolated domestically and internationally,' said
one senior Untac official in Phnom Penh.
Lt-Col John Weiland, Untac's chief of military public information, added:
'We know they have lost the capability for major military operations.'
The Khmer Rouge does have at least one more chance to come in from the cold,
and that is during the 'round-table' talks that King Norodom Sihanouk is
expected to host in November.
It is not clear, however, whether the Khmer Rouge will be prepared to meet
the demands of rival political parties and abandon control of its own zones
in northern and western Cambodia to the central government; the organisation
makes millions of dollars of year by selling timber and gems from the area
around its headquarters in Pailin near the Thai frontier.
'If they continue their ways, definitely they will become outlaws,' said
Prince Ranariddh, who is King Norodom's son, Funcinpec leader and senior
prime minister, as he emerged from parliament after the adoption of a new
democratic constitution on September 21.
Although some diplomats are wary of prematurely consigning the Khmer Rouge
to the dustbin of history - US intelligence was notoriously dismissive of
Khmer Rouge strength just before the guerrillas took power in 1975 - the
hundreds of recent defectors have provided sufficient proof that Pol Pot and
his colleagues are politically confused and militarily weakened.
Asked why he had surrendered after 20 years of fighting, Mr Siv Nin, another
Khmer Rouge colonel and regiment commander, replied: 'Because I'm very tired
of war.'

FT  29 SEP 93 / Rao seeks to calm foreign investor fears

INDIA PLANS to sign bilateral investment protection treaties with the US,
the UK, Germany and other countries in order to reassure potential foreign
investors about the safety of their investments, Prime Minister P V
Narasimha Rao said yesterday.
Mr Rao told a businessmen's conference in New Delhi that the treaties, which
are commonly used between countries to codify foreign investors' legal
rights, would show India's 'firm commitment and assurance to foreign
investors'.
In a wide-ranging review of economic reform, Mr Rao pledged to continue with
the liberalisation programme he started two years ago. He said reforms were
planned in the Companies Act, which governs corporate rights, in foreign
exchange legislation and in the financial markets.
The prime minister's speech was seen in Delhi as an attempt to restate the
government's commitment to economic reform at a time when ministers have
been preoccupied with other issues, notably the political impact of the
destruction of the Ayodhya mosque last December. However, Mr Rao tempered
promises of further liberalisation with warnings about the dangers of
over-rapid change.
Mr Rao said: 'We cannot be deterred or diverted from the chosen path, which
is to secure our rightful place in the world economy.' Responding to charges
that the government had slowed the pace of reform in recent months, the
prime minister said it was important that the system was able to absorb
reform 'without collapsing'.
In some other countries reform had gone too fast with 'undesirable results'.
In India the process of spreading reform through levels of government had to
be accelerated but it could not be 'jumped over', said Mr Rao.
The prime minister added that reform would have 'a human face' with
government acting to ensure the poor did not have to wait 10 to 15 years for
the benefits of reform. He warned that the difficult part of the reform
process still lay ahead. There had to be a careful balance between reform
and economic stability so the adverse effects were kept to a minimum.
Indian lorry drivers yesterday called off a nationwide strike on its 13th
day following an assurance by the government that its Transport Development
Council would meet on October 1 to discuss the truckers' demand for a
reduction in fees levied by Indian states when crossing their territory,
Shiraz Sidhva adds.
More than 1.8m largely self-employed drivers took their vehicles off the
roads, affecting prices of essential commodities. Two people were killed and
over 1,000 arrested when the government tried to use force to make the
truckers resume work under the Essential Services Maintenance Act and the
National Security Act.

FT  29 SEP 93 / Japan's leading indicators paint a grim picture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE OUTLOOK for a recovery in depressed Japanese corporate and consumer
confidence is weak, according to the latest set of economic statistics
published yesterday.
Japan's index of leading economic indicators stood at 40 in July, the third
consecutive month in which it has fallen below 50, the dividing line between
growth and decline.
The index, published by the Economic Planning Agency as a measure of the
outlook for the next six months, rose from 30.8 in June.
Among the components pointing to a slight improvement, inventories of raw
materials were down for the fifth month running, money supply rose for the
fourth month, and new machinery orders rose for the first time in four
months
However, the index has recently proved an unreliable recovery indicator. It
was well above 50 for the first four months of the year, so adding to
groundless hopes that the downturn was near an end, said Mr Jeff Young at
Salomon Brothers Asia.
The yen's greater than expected rise is one reason why the downturn is more
severe than many industrial companies had feared, even a few months ago.
This was highlighted yesterday by a 14.7 per cent annualised decline in car
exports last month. That was the fifth monthly decline running and the worst
performance for 14 years, said the Japan Automobile Manufacturers'
Association.
Hopes of an export boom to China have been cut short, as Japanese car sales
there only increased by 3.3 per cent in August, after having doubled in the
previous seven months, the association said. Exports to the European
Community fell 13.4 per cent and sales to the US were down 16.4 per cent in
August.
Further evidence emerged yesterday of the depressed state of Japanese
consumer spending, one of the main factors in what is becoming the country's
worst recession since the 1973 oil price shock.
Sales at department stores and large retailers dropped 4.2 per cent in
August from the same month the previous year, the Ministry of International
Trade and Industry announced. This marks the fifteenth monthly fall running.
However, some retailers, such as thriving discount stores, have reported
signs of an upturn in September sales.

FT  29 SEP 93 / US multinational pulls out of Dollars 30m Indian project
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
INDIA'S hopes of attracting foreign investment have suffered a setback with
a decision by Cargill, the US multinational, to pull out of a proposed
Dollars 30m (Pounds 19m) salt-processing project in Kandla, Gujarat.
'This is a tremendous setback to our economic reforms,' a top official of
the Finance Ministry said yesterday. The country is in the throes of a
wide-ranging economic modernisation programme in which foreign companies are
expected to play an important role importing capital and technology.
Cargill's decision to abandon its proposed investment is largely due to
factors specific to its project and is not a sign of general disaffection
with India's economic policies. However, the fear in New Delhi is that other
companies may also be tripped up by similar controversies, impeding the
liberalisation process.
Cargill South East Asia announced on Monday that legal action had prompted
it to withdraw from the salt project. The company, facing a suit filed in
February by the Kandla Small Scale Salt Manufacturers' Association, told a
high court in Gujarat it was 'no longer interested in building an
export-oriented salt works in the Kandla Port Trust area'.
A company official said this was 'a business decision, as contesting the
association would have meant protracted litigation and delay for Cargill'.
But Mr George Fernandes, MP, and his protest group, the Samajwadi Abhiyan,
is claiming credit for Cargill's decision. 'I am happy that we have hounded
out Cargill,' says the Janata Dal politician who as industries minister in
1977 forced Coca-Cola and IBM to wind up their Indian operations. 'We have
proved that by following Gandhi's method of concerted, non-violent people's
action it is possible to defeat the combined power of the multinationals and
the government.'
Mr Fernandes and the Samajwadi Abhiyan, a combination of associations
representing salt farmers, politicians and social workers, have been
agitating against the salt project since it was approved earlier this year.
They had threatened to intensify their stir against Cargill on October 2,
the anniversary of the birth of Mahatma Gandhi.
The group won popular support through a publicity campaign highlighting
their fears that Cargill's entry into the area would deprive thousands of
small-scale salt farmers of their livelihood.
Cargill, which in July faced the wrath of farmers in Karnataka attacking its
seeds operations there, will not be the last multinational the organisation
will target. 'We are already planning a 'Banish Coke and Pepsi' campaign,'
Mr Fernandes said yesterday.

FT  29 SEP 93 / French Privatisation: France sees the Renault-Volvo merger
as Act One - Balladur's privatisation policy will take a lead from the union
of the car groups
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MERGER between Renault and Volvo, agreed this month and to take effect
from the beginning of 1994, was described by one French Industry Ministry
official as 'the first grand act of this government's industrial policy.' It
is unlikely to be the last.
Mr Gerard Longuet, industry minister in the centre-right government of Prime
Minister Edouard Balladur, has other ambitious proposals in his in-tray.
They involve the formation of corporate alliances to increase the
competitiveness of French public companies and ease the shackles of state
control. They also involve a paradox - to reduce the role of the state in
industrial affairs, it may first be necessary to intervene more.
Such intervention is likely to follow a pattern established by the
Renault-Volvo merger. The most important objectives of this alliance from
the perspective of the French government - the strengthening of Renault in
international markets, and the preparation of the company for privatisation
 -are themes in the government's other proposals. Among these are plans to
change the legal status of France Telecom from a state agency to a joint
stock company. A law to effect this is expected to be proposed by early next
year.
The aim is to enable France Telecom to exchange shareholdings with other
telecommunications groups and strengthen its position ahead of the
liberalisation of the European telecommunications market at the beginning of
1998. The French government already has foreign allies in mind. Mr Longuet,
for example, has described Germany's Deutsche Bundespost Telekom as 'a
natural partner on the European continent'.
Also under consideration is a proposal to combine Pechiney, the aluminium
manufacturer with Compagnie Nationale du Rhone, the electricity generator.
Pechiney, like Renault, is on the list of 21 state-controlled groups which
the government has said it intends to privatise. A tie-up with CNR might
make the sale of the loss-making aluminium concern more attractive.
Officials at the Industry Ministry describe the idea as 'a working
hypothesis' and say the proposal is at an early stage. However, it met with
a warm response from Mr Jean Gandois, Pechiney's chairman.
According to Mr Gandois, CNR could bring a stable supply of low-cost
electricity to his group, France's single biggest electricity consumer. From
the point of view of the government, CNR could represent a stable investor
to help replace the state on Pechiney's share register.
Further down the in-tray is the possibility of a restructuring at Thomson,
the electronics group. Of the companies on the government's privatisation
list Thomson is unique in having two distinct operations, the loss-making
consumer electronics division, and the profitable defence electronics
business.
Government officials emphasise that the goal is to increase efficiency with
the ultimate aim of reducing the state's role. 'Many state-controlled groups
require reorganisation,' said one official.
This is particularly the case as the government moves down the list of
companies to be privatised. The first four privatisation issues - Banque
Nationale de Paris, Rhone Poulenc, the chemicals group, Banque Hervet, and
Elf-Aquitaine, the oil group - are all in relatively good shape. Banque
Hervet is loss-making, but small.
Along with the three bigger groups, its sale is not expected to present any
substantial problems.
Beyond these four, however, the task becomes more difficult. About half of
the companies on the auction block are loss-making. Some, such as Bull, the
computer manufacturer, and Air France require substantial restructuring to
return to profitability and eventual sale. Given that the government has
committed FFr40bn (Pounds 4.6bn) of privatisation proceeds to its budget
this year and FFr50bn next year, it is under pressure to shake up the public
sector.
There are, however, limits. On a practical level, industrial restructuring
is a complex process. 'You can't just play Meccano with industry,' said one
official. Renault and Volvo took three years to transform their strategic
alliance into a full merger. An alliance or merger between Pechiney and CNR,
for example, would probably be resisted by EDF, the state electricity group,
which holds 17 per cent of CNR.
On a political level, too, there are constraints. This month Mr Balladur
urged state groups to minimise job losses in an attempt to curb rising
unemployment. To the extent that public industry is restricted in cutting
costs, such intervention could delay, rather than hasten, France's grand
acts of privatisation.

FT  29 SEP 93 / Plea to defend Europe's cultural identity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SOME 4,400 actors, producers and authors from France and elsewhere in Europe
yesterday signed a plea for Europe's 'cultural identity' to be kept from
being submerged in the Gatt trade negotiations.
The appeal, which appeared in Le Monde and other newspapers, coincided with
the release this week of Germinal - Emile Zola's classic novel of 19th
century miners' misery which Mr Claude Berri, the film director, has turned
into France's most expensive film.
The French film industry is hoping the FFr160m (Pounds 18.22m) film,
subsidised by national and local authorities, will help counter inroads from
such Hollywood blockbusters as Jurassic Park, which is shortly to hit French
cinemas, and highlight the importance of keeping the country's elaborate
system of support for French and European films outside Gatt's trade
liberalisation rules.
Germinal goes on release today after a premiere in Lille on Monday night
attended by President Francois Mitterrand, Mr Jacques Delors, European
Commission president, and many of the cast that ranged from big stars like
Gerard Depardieu to former miners employed as extras.
The move by the Nord/Pas de Calais regional council to invest FFr10m in the
film has been sharply criticised by Mr Bruno Bonduelle, president of APIM,
the region's development agency, as 'a catastrophe' for an area that is
seeking to shed its rust-belt image and to attract modern investment,
including the planned European central bank. But Ms Marie-Christine Blandin,
the Green politician who heads the regional council, defended the film as
reminding audiences of the 'dignity and solidarity' of the miners.
'If culture cannot be treated as an exception in the Gatt negotiations,
Europe's cultural identity will die,' Mr Berri said this week. The French
government is pressing the European Commission to insist that audiovisual
broadcasting be kept out of the world trade talks. Paris fears that
eventually Gatt rules could be used by the US, first to dismantle the quota
system requiring French TV stations to fill no less than 60 per cent of
their prime air time with EC-made programmes, and then to attack film
subsidies.

FT  29 SEP 93 / Germans and French scheming EC reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRANCE and Germany are preparing potentially far-reaching reforms to
strengthen the position of big powers in the European Community.
The proposals, to be presented at the special EC summit on October 29,
threaten to open up old wounds over institutional reform already inflamed by
the debate over the Maastricht treaty.
France and Germany want to ensure that an enlarged Community remains capable
of decisions. But along with the UK, they also fear their influence being
diluted.
A broader impulse in Paris and Bonn - not necessarily shared in London  - is
to maintain momentum towards European integration at a time when doubts
about European economic and monetary union are growing.
Smaller EC members such as Luxembourg and Denmark are said to be 'appalled'
at French and German pressure to introduce new rules for majority voting in
the EC council of ministers, arguing that the reforms could relegate them to
second-class EC membership.
They warn that French and German efforts to streamline the EC and make it
less bureaucratic risk upsetting the delicate political balance which -
since 1958 - has made it a Community of equals preserving the need for
unanimity on some important issues.
Finland, Sweden, Norway and Austria fear that an argument over institutional
reform could alienate domestic public opinion already sceptical about
joining the EC.
They are worried about the impact on enlargement negotiations and possible
delay of their planned entry into the Community by January 1, 1995.
'Do the Germans know what they are doing?' said one senior Nordic official
who said Bonn had set an informal deadline of March 1 for settlement of the
institutional questions.
British officials predict a 'vigorous debate', but argue that Germany's
determination not to delay the enlargement negotiations is likely to triumph
over its interest in wide-ranging institutional reform.
The French and German proposals for reform are still in draft stage, but one
senior official said French and German positions appeared to be 'very
closely co-ordinated'. He said the ideas appeared similar to two papers
drawn up by Mr Karl Lamers, foreign affairs spokesman of the German
Christian Democrat Union, and Mr Jean-Louis Bourlanges, a French member of
the European Parliament.
These papers do not enjoy official status, but are believed to represent
strands of thinking within the French and German governments. Among the
proposals are:
A voting system in the council of ministers requiring both a majority of
member states and a majority taking into account their populations -
condition that would strengthen unified Germany.
A maximum 10-member European Commission, to be selected by the Commission
President from nominees by the member states, and approved by both the
European Parliament and the Council of Ministers.
Under this plan, the Nordic countries could no longer boast to their public
that they had preserved the right to send a commissioner to Brussels.

FT  29 SEP 93 / EC agrees airline booking code
</HEADLINE>

EC TRANSPORT ministers yesterday agreed on a new code of conduct for airline
computer reservations systems (CRS), intended to prevent those airlines
which own a bookings system from poaching passengers from airlines which
participate in it.
In the background of this decision is a long-running battle about so-called
'de-hosting' - separating ownership and use of CRS - between American
Airlines and its Sabre system, and its two European rivals, Amadeus and
Galileo, in which several European carriers hold shares.
Sabre is the world's largest CRS and American Airlines has claimed that its
European rivals have tried to prevent its expansion inside the EC by
brandishing the de-hosting weapon, by claiming that American has a lock-hold
on its own system.
European carriers also objected that the EC proposal obliging European CRS
to provide flight information to rival CRS, would give Sabre an competitive
advantage inside the Community.
However, after reaching a compromise last week, the EC yesterday agreed on a
partial 'de-hosting', intended to offer safeguards to carriers which are
part of another booking system.
'There are now going to be strict rules making sure that the companies
running it are not poaching passengers from those taking part in it,' said
Lord Caithness, the UK deputy transport minister in charge of aviation.
The two European systems already make sure that the owners can only view
their own data, allowing customers to shop for fares throughout the system.
This will now be true of all systems including Sabre. And the European
Commission will police the new rules, and has undertaken to prosecute
vigorously any abuses.

THE MOST popular entrance to the White House had been behind the
Barrikadnaya metro station, beside a posh Italian restaurant called
Arlecchino and the Moscow Film Centre. Thus it was there, yesterday morning
where the largest crowd gathered to vent their frustration at being unable
to get to parliament.
In front of the militia, the rows of railings and the trucks drawn up behind
them stood a crowd of vociferous demonstrators, the regulars who have
appeared each day before the White House to show support for the dissolved
parliament and the week-old resistance of parliamentary speaker, Mr Ruslan
Khasbulatov, and the vice-president, Mr Alexander Rutskoi, to President
Boris Yeltsin's emergency rule.
Many of the demonstrators stood and bellowed at the militia - 'Comrades, for
shame, think of what you're doing serving this criminal regime of
Yeltsin's'. Two men purloined kitchen chairs, and one recited patriotic
poetry into a microphone while the other held the crackling loudspeaker.
The cold rain fell on bare heads and umbrellas.
Deputies holding out inside can no longer return if they leave for food,
fuel or succour. Under a tree to one side stood a group of deputies who had,
they said, left the parliament for the night and had been unable to
re-enter.
One, who said he came from Siberia but refused to give his name, said they
had secured an apartment in the city centre where an alternative, exiled
parliament could meet.
They appeared defeated, demoralised. In the midst of the crowd was a
familiar figure, Colonel Viktor Alksnis, the former leader of the 'Soyuz'
group of hardline, anti-Gorbachev deputies in the Soviet parliament.
He was surrounded by well-wishers who fed him hot tea and a loaf of bread.
Colonel Alksnis, as quick-fire of delivery as ever, repeated the familiar
themes. Yeltsin's was a criminal administration, the regions were against
him, the man who had broken the Soviet Union (Col Alksnis had been in
politics to try to prevent such a disintegration) was now breaking Russia -
and yet, responsibly, he urged the knot of people about him not to take up
arms. The futility of it in the present circumstances was readily apparent.
All around were groups of militia and Interior Ministry troops - armed with
Kalashnikov assault rifles and machine pistols.
When they occasionally marched in rough formation from one post to another,
the crowd surrounded them, shouting with great passion Po-zor], Po-zor]
(shame) in ironic time to their marching steps. The troops tried to look
unconcerned. One put his hands over his ears, a gesture interpreted by the
crowd as giving a sign that he felt shame.
As often in a Russian crowd, it was the women - middle-aged and elderly -
who took the initiative. A number of the women surrounded a small knot of
foreign reporters and accused us of lying in the service of Mr Yeltsin.
One, with a mocking smile on her face, said: 'You support Yeltsin as a great
democrat - and here's the result, you can see. There's your democracy for
you.'
A Russian photographer who had managed to penetrate a little inside the
police lines before being sent out reported that columns of special riot
units had been drawn up within the perimeter.
Within the White House - according to the government - are some 500-600
deputies and defenders, including armed 'extremist groups'.
The stage last night was set for a confrontation.

FT  29 SEP 93 / Bosnian Moslems insist on land for peace
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LEADERS of the Bosnian Moslem community yesterday endorsed the principle of
ethnic partition for Bosnia but rejected the partition map proposed under
the latest peace plans, and insisted that Moslem territories seized by force
should be returned.
This conditional acceptance left unclear whether Mr Alija Izetbegovic,
Bosnia's president, would now sign the peace plan and try to negotiate for
more land - or hold out for land concessions from his Serb adversaries
before approving the proposal to divide Bosnia into three ethnic
mini-states.
Serb leaders have repeatedly refused to hand over any more land, threatening
instead to rout their out-gunned Moslem opponents on the battlefield.
Sarajevo radio said 218 of 349 Moslems, including writers, religious leaders
and politicians, voted for conditional acceptance. Fifty-three voted to
accept the plan without any preconditions, and 78 voted against.
The 'qualified yes' decision of the Moslem leadership, during the first
exclusively Moslem political assembly, was non-binding. But it was expected
to sway the Bosnian parliament, which yesterday adjourned a meeting until
today.
The prominent Moslems, in raising objections to the failure of the latest
version of the partition plan to restore mostly Moslem territory, set no
deadline for when the 'ethnically cleansed' land should be returned.
Mr Izetbegovic may be hoping that severe United Nations sanctions will prod
his Serb foes into more land concessions. UN sanctions have been in force
for 16 months.
Western diplomats yesterday said the vote was a setback to the peace
process, but suggested that the result was a face-saving solution, allowing
the Moslem leaders to appease radical elements while leaving the door open
for a further agreement.
Although diplomats say an outright rejection by the Moslems could endanger a
pledge to deploy Nato troops in Bosnia, British and French officials
yesterday indicated that a 'sign now, negotiate later' solution could still
pave the way for the deployment of peacekeepers.
But in an ominous note for the new Bosnian state, Mr Izetbegovic earlier
yesterday called on the Bosnian army to defend the integrity of Bosnia after
Mr Fikret Abdic, a local powerbroker from the north-western Bihac pocket,
had apparently orchestrated his 400-member assembly to declare an
'Autonomous Province of Western Bosnia'.
The area, although encircled by Serbs rebels in Croatia and Bosnia, has
managed to survive the war by trading with its enemies.
Meanwhile, in Belgrade, the ruling Socialist party lashed out at the
ultra-nationalist leader, Mr Vojislav Seselj, after he proposed a vote of
no-confidence in the government of Mr Slobodan Milosevic. A party statement
described Mr Seselj, once Mr Milosevic's favourite politician and a
parliamentary deputy, as the 'personification of evil' who embodied
primitivism.
The Croatian president, Mr Franjo Tudjman, yesterday met the UN Security
Council in New York to present his demand that the UN peacekeepers should
either disarm the Serb rebel forces in Croatia or withdraw completely.
Mr Tudjman warned the General Assembly later that Croatia would terminate
the UN mission by the end of November, if its mandate was not strengthened
within the next 48 hours.
But UN officials insisted that the peacekeepers could not be expected to
forcibly disarm the Serb rebels, who currently control about a third of
Croatia's territory.

FT  29 SEP 93 / Georgia suffers another martyred moment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Eduard Shevardnadze, safely back in the Georgian capital of Tbilisi
yesterday, faces both the division of the country he leads into warring
fiefdoms and the collapse of a 10-month policy mixing compromise with force,
neither of which has brought him success.
Bitter after his flight from the port city of Sukhumi, the last substantial
base in the region of the Georgian forces that was finally taken on Monday
by Abkhazian rebel forces, he blamed 'imperialist (Russian) forces' for the
loss of the city.
'Sukhumi could have been saved even yesterday. Only Russia could have done
it and we asked Russia to do it.'
Mr Shevardnadze's keenly felt sense of responsibility for the loss of the
city stems from the agreement he made in July with the Abkhazian leader, Mr
Vladislav Ardinba, and the Russian president, Mr Boris Yeltsin, to withdraw
Georgian forces from Sukhumi to allow negotiations to continue during a
ceasefire.
The negotiations were fruitless, the Abkhazian forces attacked the city  -
and Russia, a guarantor of the ceasefire, sat on its hands. Though nothing
has been stated openly, it seems clear that the Russian foreign and defence
ministries were at odds - with the first proclaiming its readiness to uphold
the agreement, and General Pavel Grachev, the defence minister, flatly
refusing to send troops to enforce it. He called instead for the Georgians
to withdraw in the face of the Abkhazian attack.
They have now done so and the Russian-Ukrainian Black Sea Fleet has been
mobilised to assist in the evacuation of thousands of refugees fleeing the
once-pleasant resort town.
It seems clear that the Russian military, which has kept a large base at
Gudauta, further up on the Abkhazian coast from Sukhumi, has at least winked
at the supply of weapons to the Abkhazians from Russian sympathisers,
together with the participation on the Abkhazian side of volunteers from the
Russian North Caucasian states and further afield. Georgian officials go
further, insisting that Russian soldiers and commanders, using the most
modern weapons, took part in the fighting around Sukhumi in the past months.
Either way, this has meant that the Russian military has, at least by
default, commanded Russian state policy on Georgia, teaching the Georgians,
whom Russians sometimes refer to as the 'spoilt children' of the former
Soviet Union, a terrible lesson for claiming independence, refusing to join
the Commonwealth of Independent States and - under the previous president,
Mr Zviad Gamsakhurdia - indulging in violent anti-Russian rhetoric.
Mr Shevardnadze now 'rules' a dismembered country.
Its three autonomous ethnic regions, South Ossetia, Adjaria and Abkhazia,
have all claimed some kind of independence from Tbilisi.
Adjaria, the smallest, is relatively peaceful but its leadership is at odds
with the national government.
South Ossetia, scene of violent fighting with Georgian forces in 1991-92, is
now under de facto Russian protection and Abkhazia is largely held by the
rebels.
Further, the central Georgian region (it has no autonomous status) of
Mingrelia has largely been infiltrated by troops loyal to Mr Gamsakhurdia,
who is reported to be in Zugdidi, the region's main town, and is, according
to the news agency Interfax, preparing a march on the neighbouring regional
and industrial centre of Kutaisi.
How far Mr Shevardnadze can count on his supporters for continued loyalty in
the face of these reverses, and the return of Mr Gamsakhurdia, is the
question of the moment.
Mr Jaba Josseliani, leader of the Mekhedrioni faction in parliament and of
the armed grouping of the same name, broadcast yesterday his loyalty to the
Georgian people - but not to its leader.
Mr Josseliani, with others of the chieftains whose opposition caused the
violent ousting of Mr Gamsakhurdia at the end of last year, is unlikely to
switch to the ex-president - but he may support an alternative to Mr
Shevardnadze, or set himself up in his place.
Georgian politics is clannish and violent: it is also inextricably mixed
with the criminal gangs whose origins pre-dated Georgia's independence, but
which have flourished in the relative anarchy and pervasive scarcity of
goods during both Mr Gamsakhurdia's and Mr Shevardnadze's periods in office.
Like many of the post-Soviet states, the government of the country is an
embattled group with few resources, little administrative support or
competence. The best of them struggle hopelessly to cope with the tasks of
building a nation while its economy collapses, the rest of them simply use
high office for personal or factional gain.
Georgia has had not a day of internal peace since its independence was
declared in 1990.
Yesterday, its patriarch, Ilya II, said on television that 'the loss of
Sukhumi does not mean that Abkhazia is lost to us forever. Even Tbilisi has
been lost to us temporarily in history and that amounted to nothing.' In
such a perspective, the present agony of the people in Georgia is another
martyred moment among many - with more martyrs to its statehood yet to come.

FT  29 SEP 93 / Poles build centre-left coalition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WARSAW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PROSPECTS for a centre-left government in Poland improved yesterday as the
leaders of the two parties to emerge with the biggest share of the vote in
the September 19 election signed an 'initial' agreement on forming a
coalition government.
The agreement followed a meeting between Mr Alexander Kwasniewski, head of
the Left Democratic Alliance (SLD), which has 171 out of 460 seats in the
new parliament, and Mr Waldemar Pawlak, the leader of the Polish Peasant
Party (PSL), which controls 132 seats.
Both groups have their roots in the communist past when the Polish United
Workers' Party, the SLD's predecessor, governed the country and the PSL
collaborated to survive.
A statement issued by the SLD spoke of a PSL-SLD coalition, with the order
of the parties suggesting that Mr Pawlak was the likely candidate for the
post of prime minister in the next government.
Mr Pawlak, 34, won wide respect when he was prime minister for one month in
1992, but failed to put together a coalition. His party still has most of
its support in the countryside.
However, SLD spokesmen yesterday refused to comment on who would be the
leader and said that their party would talk to President Lech Walesa about
the issue. The SLD has written to Mr Walesa to ask for a meeting at which it
will report on its talks with the PSL. Constitutionally, it is up to the
president to ask a representative of one of the parties in the new
parliament to form a government.
The third prospective partner, the left-leaning Labour Union (UP), with its
beginnings in the Solidarity movement and which has 41 seats in the new
parliament, announced it would not enter an SLD-led government.
The agreement leaves the Democratic Union (UD), a mainstream Solidarity
grouping with 74 seats, in opposition.
The PSL is interested in having a say over the key economic ministries and
not just being relegated to those areas of government which impinge on the
rural population.
Thus Mr Pawlak has already said that the finance, foreign trade and labour
ministries are regarded as the key posts. His party will also be eyeing the
industry portfolio, which the PSL wants to merge with the privatisation
ministry.
Poland has been led by centrist coalition governments since the Solidarity
movement swept away communist rule in 1989 and their tough market reforms
have started to pull the country out of recession. However, many Poles have
become disillusioned with reforms that have sent real wages plummeting and
pushed unemployment above 15 per cent.
Both the SLD and the PSL support free market reforms but independent
economists expect them to advance with reforms more slowly than previous
governments.

FT  29 SEP 93 / Greek Elections: Greece's politicians avoid the M-word - A
campaign in which the vital question of neighbouring Macedonia is being
ducked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KERIN HOPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NOWHERE is the contradiction between rhetoric and reality in Greek politics
more apparent than in Florina, a northern Greek town close to the borders
with Macedonia and Albania. A decade-long drought has reduced cereal and
dairy production there and exporting companies on Florina's industrial
estate are reported close to bankruptcy as export subsidies have been
abolished and transport costs have soared because of the war in Bosnia.
However, the region's most serious problem is the loss of contact with
Macedonia since Greece stopped issuing entry visas for Macedonians last
year. Greek political leaders have avoided raising the Macedonian question
in an election campaign fought so far on economic issues. Prime Minister
Constantine Mitsotakis, leader of the New Democracy party, is not keen to
draw attention to what many voters see as his failure to solve the
nomenclature dispute in Greece's favour.
Refusing visas is one of the ways that Greece's conservative government has
tried to pressure Macedonia into changing its name. Greece argues that the
former Yugoslav republic's choice of name amounts to a territorial threat
against the northern Greek province of Macedonia.
The opposition Panhellenic Socialist Movement, expected to win a clear
victory in the October 10 poll, is promoting a new, pro-European Community
image that could be ruined if nationalist rhetoric is allowed to take over.
The message to steer clear of foreign policy issues has been passed down to
parliamentary candidates in both main parties.
Even in Florina, where the Macedonian issue has had a severe impact on the
economy, candidates have been giving it only a passing mention in speeches.
Because Greek visas are no longer easily available, Florina has lost its
main source of income, the 20,000 Macedonians who crossed the frontier daily
on business and shopping trips. Ties with Macedonia were particularly close
because a large percentage of the district's population belongs to a
Slav-speaking minority, many of whom have relatives living across the
border.
Dozens of shops in Florina have closed and the unemployment rate has risen
to about 30 per cent. As a pre-election concession to local traders, the
government has agreed to freeze interest payments for three years on loans
from state-controlled banks amounting to Dr2bn (Pounds 5.6m).
Mr Pavlos Altinis, a foreign-educated lawyer in his 30s running for the New
Democracy party, wants to persuade local farmers to adopt better irrigation
methods to defeat the drought. Communications must be improved, with the
help of European Community structural aid, he says, in order to attract
investment.
However, like most other local candidates, he insists on taking a hardline
view of the Macedonian issue. 'We are not prepared to accept terms, such as
recognition, that will compromise our national interests, just in order to
make money out of Skopje (Macedonia),' he says.
At the same time, he acknowledges that his constituency has little chance of
climbing out of recession unless cross-border trade can resume.
Like New Democracy, the socialists say they will refuse to recognise
Macedonia under that name. However, Mr George Lianis, a Pasok candidate in
Florina, says their approach would be moderate. 'We must communicate with
Skopje,' he says. 'We can start with cultural links, and there's no reason
why we shouldn't get on to trade.'

</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   KIEV
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Leonid Kravchuk yesterday ordered special measures to end the
stalemate between president and parliament and halt an economic crisis
gripping Ukraine, AP reports from Kiev.
He issued a decree creating a 10-member committee to co-ordinate reform
efforts by the central government, regional governments and business.
His action came a day after he took full executive control of government
following MPs' demands last week he assume responsibility for the faltering
economy. Mr Kravchuk's press secretary, Mr Volodymyr Shlaposhnikov, said:
'There has been a vacuum between the government and parliament. We're aiming
to fix that.'
Before Monday's decree giving Mr Kravchuk direct control of the economy, the
prime minister was in charge of economic reform and day-to-day operation of
the government.
His action followed parliament's approval last week of early legislative and
presidential elections in 1994. The president's term was originally set to
expire in the autumn of 1996 and the parliament's in the spring of 1995. Mr
Vadym Redko, acting director of foreign relations, said yesterday ministers
had not yet seen a copy of the decree. 'We know of its existence, but no one
has told us what to do.'
Mr Kravchuk appeared to be hoping for a boost in popularity before
presidential elections in June 1994. His popularity has plummeted since he
signed an agreement earlier this month with President Boris Yeltsin to give
Russia the Black Sea fleet and nuclear weapons in exchange for debt relief
and uranium to run Ukraine's nuclear plants.
Mr Yefim Zviagilsky, who was named acting prime minister last week, will
stay on until Mr Kravchuk nominates a new candidate. Mr Zviagilsky, seen as
a conservative opposed to speedy market reforms, replaced Prime Minister
Leonid Kuchma, who resigned last week after lawmakers denied him extra
powers.

FT  29 SEP 93 / German employers cancel engineering wage accords
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WEST GERMAN engineering industry employers threw down the gauntlet for a
bitter wages battle with their 4m employees yesterday by abruptly announcing
the cancellation of their existing contracts for pay and holidays.
For the first time since post-war pay negotiations began, the employers  -
rather than the mighty IG Metall trade union - served formal notice of
termination of the agreements.
While cancellation of the existing wages contract from the end of the year
is a formality, cancellation of the holiday contract is seen on the union
side as a clear move to cut the 10-year-old deal on holiday entitlements.
Mr Hans-Joachim Gottschol, president of Gesamtmetall, the employers'
organisation for the mechanical and electrical engineering industries,
including most of the German motor industry, said the move was aimed at
cutting costs across the sector.
He called on the trade union 'to enter into negotiations without delay (to
decide) precisely where we can introduce changes in wages and improvements
in productivity' which would result in rapid cost cuts for employers.
The leadership of IG Metall reacted angrily to what it saw as a declaration
of hostilities only four days before the trade union is due to hold its
annual conference and elect a new leader.
Mr Klaus Zwickel, IG Metall's acting leader, called it 'a double assault on
workers' wages . . . first they have to pay by losing jobs, and then they
have to pay again by losing wages'.
Union officials believe that the powerful small and medium-sized enterprises
that dominate the Gesamtmetall membership have seized the initiative from
the heavyweights of German industry such as Siemens, Robert Bosch and
Daimler-Benz. The latter have dictated relatively generous pay settlements
in recent years in order to ensure continuing industrial peace.
IG Metall believes the real focus of the employers is on their 10-year-old
holiday contract. At present, it allows a six-week period of paid holiday
throughout the engineering industry, plus an extra 50 per cent holiday pay.
At a press conference in Cologne, Mr Gottschol said: 'The economic situation
of the German engineering and electrical industries is worse than it has
ever been.'
Mr Gottschol said the industry was making a post-tax profit on turnover of
only 0.1 per cent, and expected an overall loss for 1993. He said unit wage
costs had risen by 20 per cent over the past three years. Western German
engineering industry production fell by 14 per cent in the first half.
Bankruptcies were up by 14 per cent to 612 in the first half. Since the
beginning of 1991 the sector has lost almost 500,000 jobs.

FT  29 SEP 93 / Clarke would tax spending rather than income
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, yesterday gave a clear hint that any tax
increases in the Budget would be on spending rather than incomes.
He was aiming for a recovery that would be 'sustained over the rest of the
decade and beyond' and which would be 'driven by investment and exports not
consumption, by the private sector not the state'.
A tax structure 'which favours enterprise, entrepreneurship and thrift'
played an important role in achieving that goal. Taxation should not prevent
business from earning a satisfactory rate of return.
'And when we tax consumers, we should target their spending, rather than
their savings or incomes,' Mr Clarke told the annual meeting of the
International Monetary Fund and World Bank. 'That means relying, wherever
possible, on indirect rather than direct taxation.'
Treasury officials stressed that the chancellor would not be making his
Budget decisions on taxation until early November. But Mr Clarke made a
conscious decision yesterday to insert a passage about tax policy in his IMF
speech confirming his long-held preference for indirect taxes such as value
added tax.
He stressed in his speech that taxation and public spending policies had an
important role in influencing saving and investment.
Mr Clarke wanted to increase both saving and investment in the UK over the
medium term. While 'working with the grain of industry and commerce', this
meant:
Keeping inflation in its tight 1 to 4 per cent target range.
Reducing public borrowing over the medium term to underpin recent falls in
long-term interest rates.
Ensuring that public-sector pay is 'under the firmest possible control to
leave maximum scope for expenditure on productive capital projects and
essential public services'.
Gearing up the government's own investment spending through the greater use
of private finance.
The chancellor said that Britain, because of its labour market reforms of
the 1980s, was better placed than many countries in Europe to translate a
sustained recovery in output into new jobs and falling dole queues.
He said labour markets everywhere must be allowed to adapt and be more
flexible if employment were to be increased in the industrial world as a
whole.
Governments had a key role to play in improving the flexibility of labour
markets. They could concentrate resources on raising standards of education
and training and provide help for people looking for jobs.
'But the greatest contribution governments can make is to refrain from
well-meant but harmful forms of labour market regulation,' Mr Clarke said.

FT  29 SEP 93 / Smith prepares for union test: Labour party leader calls for
economic expansion and social justice
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS and DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN SMITH set the stage yesterday for the most important test of his
leadership with a keynote address at Labour's Brighton conference calling
for economic expansionism and social justice.
Speaking on the eve of today's knife-edge vote about his plans to
democratise the party's links with the trade unions, Mr Smith combined a
ferocious attack on Mr John Major's 'sleazy, shabby, secretive' government
with a plea for Labour unity.
With his political authority tied inextricably to victory in the
confrontation with Labour's union paymasters, Mr Smith sought to win the
support of conference delegates by stressing commitment to full employment,
a minimum wage, trade union rights and strong public services.
Deriding the economic record of 14 years of Conservative rule, he emphasised
that Labour would generate faster economic growth through increased
investment in education, training, infrastructure and industry.
Mr Smith won enthusiastic ovations with a series of mocking references to
the threat to Mr Major's party leadership, warning that if he were replaced
Labour would demand an immediate general election. He defined the choice
which would face the electorate as between 'a high-skill economy and a
bargain-basement Britain, a choice bet-ween investing in education and
health and the neglect that leads to rising crime, and a choice between a
more democratic and open society and a secretive and shabby government'.
To predictable applause, the Labour leader attacked the government's freeze
on the public sector pay bill as the 'price' that nurses, firefighters and
teachers had to pay for the Conservatives' 'miserable' failure. Labour would
also call a halt to 'dogmatic' privatisation.
But despite public confidence that Mr Smith would secure a
one-member-one-vote system for the selection of parliamentary candidates,
senior figures in the shadow cabinet admitted the outcome was 'too close too
call'.
Amid back-room bargaining the consensus was that the outcome would hinge on
the votes of a few small trade unions and the size of the majority for
reform among the constituency delegates.
The best guess of the party's psephologists was that Mr Smith needed the
support of two-thirds of the constituencies to counter a four-to-three
majority against change among the trade unions. One member of the leader's
camp summed up the latest mood with the comment: 'I am convinced he (Mr
Smith) will win, but I do not know how.' That impression was reinforced by
reports of nervousness among the two union delegations - the TGWU and the
GMB - most vehemently opposed to change. But neither appeared ready to back
down.
Mr John Edmonds, the leader of the GMB, praised Mr Smith's speech but his
call for a compromise over OMOV was immediately rejected by aides of the
Labour leader.
The extent of the Labour leader's difficulties was underlined last night by
Mr Bill Morris, general secretary of the TGWU, who warned a Tribune group
meeting that Labour must address the 'vacuum' that people perceived in the
party's policies.
Mr Smith postponed an explicit plea for loyalty until his second address to
the conference at the start of today's debate. But in a reference to the
tasks which would face a future Labour government, he insisted that the
party must first have 'the courage and confidence to reform our own
constitution as well'.

FT  29 SEP 93 / Anglo American switches assets to Minorco
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ANGLO AMERICAN, South Africa's largest industrial company, is simplifying
its complicated international holdings in a deal that will add Dollars 1.4bn
(Pounds 900m) of assets to the balance sheet of Minorco, its
Luxembourg-quoted offshore investment arm.
The deal comes only days after the world began lifting sanctions against
South Africa following an appeal at the United Nations by Mr Nelson Mandela,
president of the African National Congress.
Mr Julian Ogilvie Thompson, chairman of Anglo American and Minorco, said it
was 'entirely coincidental' that the deal had been announced so soon after
the US Congress had voted to lift sanctions. It did, however, 'flow from the
re-entry of South Africa into the full membership of the world community'.
Minorco will effectively take control of all Anglo American's non-diamond
investments outside Africa, in particular Anglo American's unquoted mining
investments in South America.
It signals a renewed emphasis by Minorco on copper mining and will give the
Luxembourg company control of, among others in Latin America, the giant
Colla-huasi mine in Chile.
In return, Minorco will relinquish its interests in Africa, particularly in
the Zambian copper mine, and will issue 55m shares to Anglo American.
Minorco's asset value will increase by 25 per cent to Dollars 5.4bn, but
Anglo American's interest in the quoted Minorco will also rise from 39.1 per
cent to 43.1 per cent.
The deal gives Minorco a 100 per cent holding in the group's paper and pulp
interests, Mondi European Holdings, giving it a fourth strategic leg to add
to precious metals, base metals and industrial minerals.
Mr Hank Slack, Minorco chief executive, said the deal meant that the company
could now be seen as having made the transition from holding company to a
full-blown natural resources operating company.
Minorco has been trying to make that transformation since its failed bid in
1988 for Consolidated Gold Fields, the UK minerals and industrial company
later bought by Hanson.
Analysts, however, said the deal was only a step along that path. The group
still had some way to go before the shares stopped trading at a substantial
discount to net asset value - a sign that Minorco was no longer seen by
potential investors as a holding company.
They said Minorco still had Dollars 1.1bn of cash in its balance sheet to
invest.

six months

<TEXT>
BONGRAIN, one of France's leading cheese makers, mustered static net profits
of FFr169.59m (Dollars 29.1m) in the first six months of this year against
FFr167.17m for the same period of 1992.
This was in spite of the sluggish state of the French food market.
The group, which has expanded rapidly in recent years and last year took
managerial control of ULN, a financially troubled dairy co-operative in
Normandy, suffered a slight fall in interim sales of 3.5 per cent to
FFr4.67bn from FFr4.84bn.

FT  28 SEP 93 / International Company News: Poland poised to re-open tenders
for telecom deals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BOBINSKI
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WARSAW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE SALE last week of two Polish electronics plants to Siemens is set to
trigger the announcement of new tenders by Telekomunikacja Polska (TP SA),
the country's state-owned telephone monopoly, for regional telephone
modernisation and extension contracts suspended while the Dollars 100m deal
was being negotiated.
The first tender is expected to be a contract worth over Dollars 50m for the
Wroclaw region, for which Siemens will be bidding against AT&amp;T and Alcatel.
The three companies have been promised access and the exclusion of other
suppliers to the Polish market in return for purchasing local factories.
Siemens' contract with the Polish government commits the company to Dollars
57m investment over six years in the ZWUT factory in Warsaw and the Elwro
works in Wroclaw even if it fails to win any of the forthcoming contracts
under the TP SA's Dollars 10bn investment programme.
Siemens is contractually permitted to drop its investment plans for the two
plants only if AT&amp;T were to buy a specified share of TP SA and the telephone
company was then to grant a majority of domestic orders to the US supplier.

FT  28 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Cornwell Parker slides to Pounds 4.61m -
Workforce trimmed by 10% and all UK businesses profitable
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CORNWELL PARKER, the furniture and fabrics group which issued a profits
warning in June, reported a 42 per cent fall in pre-tax profits for the year
ended July 31, from Pounds 7.91m to Pounds 4.61m.
Mr Martin Jourdan, chairman, said the business had been through 'the worst
trading conditions for years.' Nevertheless, all UK businesses remained
profitable.
He did not think the market for the group's products would improve in the
short term. 'But if and when there is an upturn it will come through to
profits very rapidly.'
The group, best known for its Parker Knoll furniture, was concentrating on
giving value for money and on extending its markets. Early in the year it
bought Fardis to strengthen its position in the French fabrics market, and
in June it bought Vibeltex, the Belgian distributor of its Monkwell fabrics.
It had also shed 10 per cent of its UK labour force, about 150 jobs, and had
succeeded in making reductions in its procurement bills that had largely
offset the effect of sterling's devaluation.
Overall turnover was Pounds 89.2m, including Pounds 5.71m from acquisitions
and Pounds 1.18m from discontinued operations. Last year's turnover was
Pounds 90m, including Pounds 3.84m from discontinued operations.
Operating profits on continuing operations were down from Pounds 8.58m to
Pounds 5.47m.
Net interest payable rose from Pounds 29,000 to Pounds 462,000, largely
reflecting the cost of recent acquisitions. Earnings per share fell from
12.4p to 7.3p. However, the final dividend is maintained at 4p, for an
unchanged total of 5.7p.
Net borrowings were Pounds 3m, giving gearing of 8.5 per cent. Shareholders'
funds stand at Pounds 36.2m (Pounds 44.6m). At the end of last year the
group had net cash of Pounds 1.4m.
The shares closed down 3p at 174p.

FT  28 SEP 93 / Arts: Smashing Pumpkins - Pop
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BERLIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Far below the Brixton Academy's cavernous black ceiling, beneath the shadowy
Italianate mock-buildings that decorate its upper walls, 1,000, perhaps
2,000 young people crush together, often crash together, illuminated
occasionally by harsh white lights from the stage. Bodies rise, feet first,
from this churning sea and are passed from hand to hand before sinking
again. From time to time the mass raise their arms and point as one towards
the front of the stage on which stand three skinny individuals lit in lurid
greens, reds, blues holding guitars.
The noise is overpowering, a screaming, thudding, relentless assault not
just on the ears but on the body. This is the Smashing Pumpkins
emphatically affirming its status as one of the hottest alternative rock
bands. It is a highly enjoyable experience. (Although it helps to have been
put in the mood by security guards whose purpose in life is to stop
passholders seeing the concert.)
What lifts the band above most of its contemporaries is its ability to use
the limited and increasingly hackneyed vocabulary of loud thrash guitar rock
to express a distinctive musical personality.
On Siamese Dream, the latest album, the Pumpkins vary the pace with
moderately complex arrangements, acoustic guitar and even a dash of cello.
Live, such signposts of subletly are abandoned for simple churn and kerrang.
The effect is visceral. The fact that the speakers are so loud that every
bass note feels like a punch in the stomach has something to do with it, but
although other bands play as loud, few are as emotionally engaging.
The assault is not unrelenting. The lull in the storm is one of leader Billy
Corgan's favourite tricks. The wall of guitar noise from Corgan and James
Iha abates, to expose the powerful skeleton of the Pumpkins' music: the
edgy, sinuous, crunching rhythm of D'Arcy, the bass player, and drummer
Jimmy Chamberlin. The effect can be disconcerting. When 'Today' begins in
relative calm, the audience chants the lyrics with Corgan, a sort of
singalong-a-max-volume, before it builds to a roar that drowns even singing
along in your head.
Each song is distinctly sculpted from the noise and the brief abatement of
noise. Each possesses its own crushing logic. But the ceaseless ebb and flow
in the tidal wave of noise prevents the set as a whole building momentum.
The effect is too controlled. It is a relief when the Pumpkins finish the
set by smashing through 'Cherub Rock' in one unbroken surge.
The encore is also reassuring. It is a shambles. Corgan emerges in a clown
suit and after 'Spaceboy' - so laid back it even contains some bottleneck
guitar from Iha - the control evaporates halfway through the next song which
starts with a surge of adrenalin and dribbles to an end with Corgan
hectoring the audience in enjoyable ego-crazed rock-star style. After a
confusing final blast of parody power chords they are gone. The audience
seems unsure whether to laugh or cheer and stands as if stunned until
someone turns the house lights on.

FT  28 SEP 93 / The FT Review of Business Books (33): Michael Milken -
monster or media myth? / A book that attempts to get inside the mind of the
junk bond king
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MONTAGNON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DANGEROUS DREAMERS by Robert Sobel John Wiley &amp; Sons Dollars 27.95 247 pages
TEN YEARS from now Michael Milken, whose junk bond takeovers were the
scourge of US corporations in the 1980s, may be forgotten. Even today, as he
languishes in prison, after being convicted on some fairly minor technical
counts, the public is only vaguely aware of what he actually did. With his
enormous pay from Drexel Burnham Lambert, which in 1987 alone amounted to
Dollars 550m, he has simply come to epitomise in many people's minds what
was wrong with the greed decade of the 1980s.
In this book, Robert Sobel explores the Milken phenomenon. At one level it
is a lucid and entertaining read about Milken's life and the colourful
characters such as T. Boone Pickens, with whom he became involved. Sobel is
good at explaining, in a not too technical way, how junk bond financing
worked, why it became popular and how the likes of Pickens and Carl Icahn
were able to enrich themselves by applying it to takeovers.
At another level Sobel tries to discover what makes men like Milken tick. He
points out that Milken was not an isolated example of an outsider who has
come to challenge the financial establishment. Men like Louis Wolfson and
Jimmy Ling, who made LTV into the one of the first conglomerates, have risen
to prominence only to be broken by an establishment they had come to
threaten.
A common thread is that they seem to be clever outsiders with an obsessive
approach to work. Milken himself was no academic genius, but he well
understood the role that debt could play in a company's expansion. When he
moved his family and his Drexel operation back to California in 1978, he
relished the opportunity to come to work at 4.00am, two hours before New
York opened. But the arrangement also gave him more opportunity to spend
time with his children and he gave heavily from what he earned to charity.
The 1980s were an age well-suited to junk bonds. Interest rate deregulation
meant savings and loans were looking for higher yield assets, for example,
while corporate taxation rules favoured debt over equity. In that sense
Milken was simply a product of his age.
For all that, he remains something of an enigma. The authorities never
managed to prove the worst charges against him, and the extent to which
short cuts were taken and favours bestowed on clients to secure Drexel's
extraordinary placing power remains obscure.
Likewise the predators of the 1980s had a point when they said they were
picking on companies that had failed to realise shareholder value. In his
attempt to be impartial and explain, Sobel is perhaps too reluctant to
judge. There is no doubt that leveraged takeovers did a great deal of harm.
In the final analysis this was because the extra value that the predators
purported to bring was not real value at all.
Had he taken a more robust line, Sobel's conclusions might have been
different. Instead he suggests at the end of the book that, without the
indictment, Milken might have gone on to become a figure of global
importance, 'the greatest banker of the age.' Possibly, yes. But then again,
given the fundamentally anti-social nature of his approach, probably not.

FT  28 SEP 93 / The FT Review of Business Books (34): Banks, brothels and a
high body count - . . . it's all there in Ken Follett's latest saga of
skulduggery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A DANGEROUS FORTUNE by Ken Follett Macmillan Pounds 14.99 434 pages
IN SPITE OF its gentlemanly image, merchant banking is a cut-throat
business. But by the time young Hugh Pilaster finally struggles to the top
of the family firm, the body count has surely breached every definition of
good corporate governance.
Not that poor, priapic Hugh - the mere sight of a female breast means a week
of restless nights - has any blood on his hands. He is decent and honourable
in business, though a little less classy when it comes to women like Maisie,
the former circus bareback rider who still performs tricks for gentlemen
friends.
Most of the skulduggery is down to Augusta, Hugh's scheming, statuesque,
sex-starved aunt, who conspires with multiple murderer Micky Miranda (no
relation to Carmen) to destroy lives and careers in order that her own
branch of the family gets the gilt and the glory.
Micky hails from Cordova, where his dad dreams of being president and amuses
himself by blasting the heads off dwarves. One unfaithful mistress was
despatched by a rifle pointed 'up her'. Cordovans do not like it up them.
But those were the good old days, when Pilaster's bank granted a loan and
saved a monarch or refused an advance and started a revolution; when, in
Cordova, a silver dollar would do nicely for a slap up meal, a bottle of rum
and a whore for the night.
Follett's latest, breathless novel, a 19th century saga of two dynasties,
races through banking halls and bordellos, from Santamaria to Southampton,
trailing popping hymens and involuntary deposits behind it.
There are more sub-plots than there are noughts in the author's bank
account, with the mystery drowning of one Peter Middleton during Hugh's
school days dogging his life and influencing those of many around him. But
while the characters are every bit as colourful as a Cordovan ten dollar
bill they are equally as thin.
Stubborn old Seth, Pilaster's senior partner, is smothered by a pillow, to
all intents and purposes carried off to the strongroom in the sky while
reading The Economist. He had, after all, been blocking the rise of
Augusta's husband, for whom she gets a peerage by funding a crooked MP and
whispering in the ear of Queen Victoria's lady-in-waiting.
Solly Greenbourne, heir to the other banking dynasty, threatens to withdraw
funding which Mickey has lined up for the rebels back home. He gets his,
courtesy of a careless postillion in Piccadilly; Tonio - 'one of the nicest
men I ever opened my legs for' - catches a bullet instead of a train.
Augusta's hapless son Edward, who switches affections between bawdy house
'dollymops' and Mickey himself, briefly gets the top job and a more
permanent dose of syphilis.
Hugh finally wins the bank and Maisie. Bankrupt Aunt Augusta grabs the
priceless snuff boxes and heads for the boat with Mickey, who takes to a
bath chair and flowered hat. But her Latin lothario has seriously misled her
all these years, both about his love for her and about the true
circumstances of that terrible drowning.
Mickey hides in the trunk from police, which Augusta promptly dumps
overboard. Too bad the Bank of England lifeboat was still decades away.

HOWARD HUGHES: THE SECRET LIFE By Charles Higham Sidgwick &amp; Jackson Pounds
16.99 360 pages
THE MOST popular form of modern fiction is the sex and shopping novel,
mainstay of airport bookstalls worldwide. The genre mixes a racy plot with
generous bouts of sex, conducted in titillating places or positions, and
orgies of shopping, usually for designer clothes.
Charles Higham's new biography of Howard Hughes, the late American playboy,
eccentric and businessman, is the non-fiction equivalent of a sex and
shopping novel.
Hughes' life, by turns romantically adventurous, sordid and bizarre, is racy
enough for a dozen novels. The son of a Texan oil wildcatter who invented an
immensely profitable drilling bit, Hughes took charge of the family tool
business at the age of 18, on the death of his father. He developed a
passion for the movie industry and by 24 had become established as an
important independent producer in Hollywood. Simultaneously, he became
hooked on flying, and one of America's most daring pioneer aviators.
Bankrolled by his father's fortune, Hughes was able to indulge these
enthusiasms with fabulous shopping sprees: he bought RKO, the Hollywood
movie studio; he bought TWA, the airline; and he founded Hughes Aircraft,
the aerospace manufacturing business now owned by General Motors.
After moving to Las Vegas and becoming a recluse, he proceeded to buy up a
good part of America's gambling capital. He died, aged 69, in 1975, in
appropriate surroundings - an airplane cabin, on a flight to Houston.
Hughes generated controversy. In Jewish-dominated Hollywood, he had a
reputation for anti-semitism. His sexually suggestive films had trouble with
the censors.
He was, suggests Higham, a master of the art of bribery. 'I can buy any man
in the world,' he is said to have declared. He fought an epic, ultimately
successful legal battle with TWA. Higham asserts that Hughes' shady dealings
even included involvement in the Watergate burglary which toppled Richard
Nixon.
Always prone to eccentricity, he became especially bizarre as he grew older:
holed up in hotels, he would spend hours constructing neat piles of Kleenex
boxes or sitting on toilet seats.
And then there was his sex life. Higham portrays Hughes as a bisexual with
an insatiable appetite, particularly for Hollywood stars. His conquests are
said to have included Ginger Rogers, Katharine Hepburn, Bette Davis, Cary
Grant and Tyrone Power. The author even asserts that Hughes may have been an
early, but undiagnosed, victim of Aids.
However, Higham, whose previous books are mainly biographies of film stars,
largely ignores Hughes's career as a businessman - dismissing him as a
hopeless manager so obsessed by sex, flying and partying that he left the
running of his empire to others.
In Hughes' youth, says Higham, 'when balance sheets and tax charges reached
him, he tossed them impatiently aside. Had he been the industrialist he was
credited with being, he would have lost everything.'
This seems too harsh a judgment. Hughes may have been an unpleasant human
being and a poor manager, yet he was also a man of no small vision who
played a pioneering role in the growth of the modern US aviation industry.
Higham is also disappointing in his handling of his stated subject - Hughes'
private life. The reader gets bogged down by his flat writing style, wealth
of detail and strict adherence to chronology. Worse, Hughes never really
comes alive, remaining a two-dimensional enigma. In biography, as in life,
an unremitting diet of sex and shopping makes for a pretty shallow
experience.

FT  28 SEP 93 / The FT Review of Business Books (32): Is it really the Wall
Street of shame? - Raymond Snoddy on a racy, pacy - and possibly
preposterous - history of the Journal / Media
</HEADLINE>

THE POWER AND THE MONEY: INSIDE THE WALL STREET JOURNAL by Francis X. Dealy,
Jr Birch Lane Press Dollars 22.50 374 pages
THE Wall Street Journal could hardly be more respectable or respected
throughout the world of business - at least, that part of it influenced in
any way by the US.
Its staid columns, enlivened only by the occasional line drawing, are almost
eccentric in the degree to which they ignore the conventions of modern
newspaper design and presentation.
Yet according to Francis Dealy's account of the Journal and the people who
produce it, appearances are deceptive. His case is not only that the paper's
parent Dow Jones has demonstrated business incompetence on a considerable
scale, or that the Journal 'missed' some of the biggest stories of the 1980s
such as the savings and loan or the Michael Milken scandals, but that there
has been behaviour at a senior level verging on the corrupt.
Favourable stories could be planted, it is alleged, or the unfavourable
played down by taking to lunch a senior figure with a taste for social
climbing. Then there is at least one serious case of nepotism at a senior
editorial level, the suggestion that promotion owed more to living in the
same neighbourhood as senior executives and even the implication that one
senior Journal editorial figure slept with a head of state to get a
prize-winning interview.
For a book that goes on to produce such lurid allegations the narrative
begins conventionally enough with a good account of the early years of the
paper and its purchase at the turn of the century by the legendary Clarence
Barron for Dollars 156,000, including the Dow Jones Ticker Service.
Barron was a formidable business journalist whose Seven Points to Better
Reporting and Writing could still enlighten contemporary journalism
students. For example: '7. The lead is everything. Rework it thirty times.
And invariably on the thirty-first try, a perfect paragraph flows from
somewhere.'
The book is also interesting on the thinking behind the launch of the Asian
Wall Street Journal, the role of the Journal in American business life and
the perennial debate in any financial publication about where the balance
should lie between specialist and more general news - how many 'frisky
furniture' stories, as the more mundane business stories are called
in-house, should be carried.
Inevitably, however, this book will be judged on the accuracy of the more
extreme allegations made. Is the Wall Street Journal really such a seething
mass of monstrous egos, alternatively missing major stories and cutting
ethical corners?
A number of those who know the paper well have dismissed the allegations as
'bunk', and although Dealy did work at the Journal it was as an advertising
salesman.
The habit of reconstructing events through the proliferation of extraneous
detail as if there was someone standing by with a video camera does not
exactly instill confidence. ('It was Monday, May 23, 1954 at 7.43am and
Eddie Schamp, Bill Kerby's chauffeur, had the motor idling as the Dow Jones
limousine waited outside 11 Columbia Terrace . . . ')
The Power and the Money is not a book to indulge in innocent explanations
where a decent conspiracy will do or give up the chance of portraying events
in an unfortunate light for the Journal.
For example, Dealy refers to New York Times coverage on a Saturday of a case
involving a possible tobacco industry research fraud and is disparaging
about the fact that the Journal carried the tobacco industry response in its
Monday columns, something that simply could have been caused by trying to
find a fresh angle on an 'old' story. However, the author quotes an unnamed
Journal reporter as saying: 'I don't know for sure, but it is not
unreasonable to assume we downplayed the story not to offend an advertiser.'
While this is undoubtedly a racy read for anyone interested in newspapers
and how they cover business I am left with the nagging feeling that it is
not unreasonable to wonder how much of this book I should believe.
At least one important conclusion rings true - that the Wall Street Journal
has already reinvented itself a number of times, the last in the 1940s, and
that the process should not be over.
'For the Journal to continue into the twenty-first century it needs to be
transformed again. Yet like Cassandra's prophecy, the prognosis goes
unheeded,' Dealy argues. Maybe this time the transformation could include a
redesign.

FT  28 SEP 93 / The FT Review of Business Books (30): A new frontier is open
for business / Review of publications that can help you through the maze -
Eastern Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LINDA BILMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE past four years, more books have been written on doing business with
Eastern Europe than there has been business. This may be about to change.
Privatisation has given a jump-start to local capital markets, and increased
the opportunities for foreign investment.
Books on the region have begun to reflect this new atmosphere, although most
still fall into the turgid tome or 'Let's Go To Moscow' variety. Here is a
round-up of the new books on offer.
                         *      *      *
Despite the silly title, Richard Poe's How to Profit from the Coming Russian
Boom (McGraw Hill, Dollars 24.95, 289 pages) is the perfect book for your
next flight to Moscow. It captures the excitement of working in Russia these
days (what Poe calls 'the honky-tonk air of a boomtown in the Klondike'),
without minimising the danger and difficulty of embarking on a Russian
commercial venture. The book is lively, fun to read, and a useful guide to
doing business.
The book is intended to help the would-be businessman manoeuvre around
Russia. Poe, a journalist, proffers lots of practical, anecdotal advice on
how westerners can make the most of the opportunities. The book provides
information on key industries and regions of the CIS: location; production;
imports and exports; true conditions (good and bad). Poe points out that
Russians do not need 'everything', and he identifies the products and
services that are in demand.
The hyperbole can be irritating. 'Russia is putting on the auction block the
largest store of undervalued stocks ever marketed in history.' 'Prices have
hit rock bottom. They have nowhere to go but up.' Nonetheless, he explains
the privatisation process in plain English. While his optimism may be
premature, there is no doubt that the new commodity and stock exchanges
trading in vouchers offer an unprecedented opportunity for western investors
 -which this book is the first to mention.
Europeans may find the book too American and a tad flippant, but it is worth
Dollars 25 (Pounds 16). Published in July 1993, it should be up-to-date for
another year, by which time, no doubt, the enterprising Mr Poe will have
graced us with a second edition.
                         *      *      *
At the other end of the spectrum - dated and of limited practical value -
the CBI Initiative Eastern Europe has published Doing Business in Russia
(Kogan Page, Pounds 25, 284 pages). Written by a hodgepodge of contributors
(ALM Consulting, Frere Cholmeley Bischoff, KPMG Peat Marwick, British Gas,
et al) the book attempts to lay out the current legal and economic framework
for British business entering the Russian market.
Written from a theoretical rather than a practical perspective, the book
covers topics such as foreign exchange, privatisation, property, and
distributor networks. The best sections are the chapter on banking (written
by Moscow Narodny Bank), which provides useful names and addresses of banks
throughout the region, and the chapter on dispute resolution, which
clarifies the procedures in this complex area.
The main problem is that the book is based on laws and information prior to
January 1993. A lot has changed since then, points out Mr Gilberto Sanchez,
an economic adviser to the Russian Ministry of Privatisation. Most notably,
4000 medium and large enterprises have been privatised so far this year,
versus none last year. Nor does the book explain the opaque system for
getting hold of real estate, which is a critical hurdle for British
retailers wishing to set up in Moscow. The sections on export licenses and
exchange rates are completely out-of-date.
                         *      *      *
The Baltic States present a different challenge from Russia, and Richard
Abbott's Doing Business in the Baltic States (Kogan Page, Pounds 30 254
pages) is a reasonable starting point for those considering an investment.
Abbott is a consultant specialising in the Baltics; his book contains lots
of bread-and-butter information buried in a style that is rather dull.
Abbott makes a good case for investing in the Baltics - why, he wonders, is
there so much enthusiasm for doing business in Hungary and the Czech
Republic while the Baltics get lumped with Moldova and Kyrgyzstan? After
all, the Baltics have an excellent geographical position, 8m westernised
citizens, democracy, and a large trading and manufacturing base which needs
foreign investment.
The book is divided into three parts: Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania. For
each state, Abbott reviews recent history, the economic base,
infrastructure, foreign investment laws, and basic information on the local
market. Although it is based on pre-February 1993 information, this is less
of a drawback than it is for the Doing Business in Russia because there are
so many fewer sources of information about the Baltics.
                         *      *      *
For more academic reading, the prolific Roman Frydman, Andrzej Rapaczynski,
and John Earle have produced two more volumes in their 1993 series - The
Privatisation Process in Russia, Ukraine, and the Baltic States (Oxford
University Press, Pounds 30/Pounds 10, 290 pages) and The Privatization
Process in Central Europe (Oxford University Press, Pounds 30/Pounds 10, 276
pages) which explains privatisation in Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Hungary,
Poland, and Romania.
The authors are distinguished professors, and these are serious books for
serious students of the privatisation process. Rapaczynski is a close friend
of Andre Schleifer, the Harvard University professor who is virtually
directing privatisation in Russia. These books will find a place on the
reading lists for courses on modern Russian political economy, not on
airport bookshelves.
The Central European volume is better, primarily because it was written
after much of the privatisation effort was well under way, particularly in
Poland and Hungary. This makes it possible for the authors to comment on the
programmes more fully.
The Russia book, just published, provides one of the first academic
critiques of the privatisation scheme. Ukrainian privatisation is still in
its infancy, however, so there is not much to say. While it is interesting
to contrast the techniques used in Russia and the other countries, what we
really need is another book - preferably in about two years - analysing the
success of the different approaches to privatisation.
                         *      *      *
Finally, from Ljubljana, in Slovenia, an academic team have produced Foreign
Investment in Central and Eastern Europe (edited by Patrick Artisien, Matija
Rojec and Marjan Svetlicic, Macmillan, Pounds 40, 206 pages), a study of
foreign direct investment (FDI) in the region to date.
The authors and contributors analyse the extent to which each country has
attracted FDI and is likely to do so in future. Conclusion: large western
companies have committed very little, in real terms, in spite of all the
noise and signing of joint ventures. This brings us back to the first book
in this review. Richard Poe sees the lack of western investment as a huge
opportunity for the entrepreneur - a once-in-a-century chance to compete
with the cautious multinationals and profit from the coming Russian boom.
One of the newsletters mentioned in the Summer edition of the Review has
changed its contact number. East European Privatisation News, the only
publication specialising in privatisation and stock market activity in
Eastern Europe, can now be contacted on 071-240 3321, or 0737-770 111, fax
071-240 3835/0737-770 222. The annual subscription price is Pounds 230 for
the UK, Pounds 250/Dollars 400 for the rest of the world.

FT  28 SEP 93 / The FT Review of Business Books (27): Big issues, from guru
to guru / Assessing the latest offerings in new media - Management
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
IS THE WORLD economy going through a mere recession or a profound
restructuring? What lies ahead for companies and individuals? Large
questions such as these have exercised the mind of Peter Drucker, who was
the first modern management guru and, in spite of his advancing years,
remains the most incisive, original and stimulating management thinker of
our time.
The difficulty with Drucker's work is that it is dense and demanding: one
needs stamina and commitment to carry oneself through even his shorter
books.
So how to introduce or be introduced to Drucker's seminal insights if one
has less stamina and inclination? Warren Bennis is a guru in his own right,
and has a personable avuncular manner which enables him to carry off a
conversation with Drucker in front of the camera as if it were an everyday
event (Facing the Challenge, two videos with trainer's notes, BBC Training
Videos, Pounds 395).
With video comes variety too - here introduced not merely to provide pace,
but tactfully to illustrate and enliven the more cerebral points. And with
video comes control: you can stop the recording in mid-flow, if you wish to
pause for clarification of precisely what is an Information-Based
Organisation or a Knowledge-Worker, or of why change is a particular
challenge today.
Warren Bennis himself presents Coaching the Team (two videos with trainer's
notes, BBC Training Videos, Pounds 345) covering what he believes to be the
essential skills of management in the 1990s. These turn out to be Coaching
and Team-working; Coaching consisting of Direction, Listening, Observation
and Encouraging a Positive Attitude, and Teamworking consisting of Finding
Direction, Generating Ideas, Decision Making, Planning, Learning from
Experience, Listening, Observation and Encouraging.
I remain sceptical about how 'new' the need for these skills is; the great
leaders of the past were great coaches and produced great teams, whether one
thinks of Alexander or of Jesus. Repackaged for presentation as the concepts
of Coaching and Teamworking may be, they remain more common in the world of
talk than of reality. Lectures and video packages may not translate talk
into reality, but they do help make people aware of the need, and thus
contribute at least indirectly to bringing them to birth.
In a previous column, I mentioned the far-sighted policy of IMEC Publishing,
which issues its reference materials in computer-accessible form as well as
in print. Its Directory of Eastern European Management Education
(co-published with the European Foundation for Management Development, 40
Rue Washington, B-1050 Brussels; A-4 paperback, 520 pages, BFr 1000) is a
pioneering venture, which contains documentation on the educational systems
in Eastern European countries, as well as the programmes, profiles and
business-related faculty of all universities and business schools. The work
is surprisingly comprehensive in the context of a situation as formless,
complex and rapidly-changing as any in the world .
To make sense of this kind of a world, and to enable your company to survive
in it, you need good old leadership. If you think this, you may find your
ideas somewhat challenged by The Power of Leadership (two videos, each in a
separate pack with a copy of the script as well as a copy of the trainer's
notes, Industrial Society, Pounds 500).
This started life as a six-part Anglia TV series called Leaders, which took
the unusual step of letting an array of putative leaders and experts on the
subject speak for themselves without a great deal of editorial shaping or
comment, beyond dividing the material into the two broad themes (one per
video) of 'What makes a good leader?' and 'Leadership in action'. The result
is a fascinating variety of opinion on the subject, some of it
contradictory. This makes the videos an excellent discussion-starter on
almost any aspect.
However, the pack does editorialise to the extent of suggesting a new model
of leadership, which goes beyond the now-hackneyed contrast of management
and leadership, and includes command-based leadership, team-leadership as
well as what it dubs 'Super-Leadership' (focusing on Transformation and
Vision-Sharing).
This holistic model is quite a useful one for leaders and followers to
internalise. After all, the only true definition of leadership is the
capacity to create followers. Leadership cannot exist without followership.
It follows that if leaders and followers are to be effective, they must be
in consonance with each other.
Being in tune with each other is more difficult if one is from a different
culture, and this is the area explored by Building the Transnational Team
(one video with brief trainer's notes, Transnational Management Associates,
London &amp; Paris, no price given). Well acted by professional actors, though a
shade less well directed, the script explores stereotypically, though
wittily, the habits and perceptions of Europeans and Americans in a meeting
concerned with solving a simple problem.
The resolution of the inter-cultural problems is less persuasive because it
is presented with too little preparation - inevitable given the short
duration of this video. I wonder what it is that tempts us to want to
present a whole issue and the whole solution in 30 or 40 minutes.
I make these caveats in spite of my interest in this video, having been
invited to comment on the script in draft form. Perhaps video is better for
the presentation of issues than for the conveyance of direct instruction.
Anyway, there is little material available on transnational management, so
this video must be welcome.

REAL-TIME STRATEGY by Lee Tom Perry, Randall Stott and Norman Smallwood John
Wiley &amp; Sons Dollars 27.95 250 pages
MOST COMPANIES realise the need for change - but when the opportunity arises
can they actually seize it?
Such a question might well be addressed to US competitors of the Perrier
Group, which allowed the French bottled water company to jump back into the
game remarkably quickly after catastrophe struck in February 1990.
The discovery of traces of benzene, a known carcinogen, in the Perrier
product was arguably a once-in-a-lifetime chance for its rivals.
But while Perrier displayed considerable skill in limiting the damage - and
in reasserting its position as market leader - the lame response from its
competitors was extraordinary. Some of the excuses - lack of marketing
money, limited bottling capacity, fears that a weak Perrier might weaken the
overall market - made sense. But according to Lee Tom Perry, Randall Stott
and Norman Smallwood 'they did not go after the leader because they did not
want to change their strategies. The Perrier tragedy actually upset their
plans because they had settled into the role of industry followers'.
This book argues that in an increasingly interdependent world of
accelerating economic cycles such complacency is dangerous, and that
successful companies need to embrace the concept of strategic improvising.
Strategic improvising, the authors contend, responds to the concerns which
have been voiced about traditional strategic planning. As a real-time
process it promotes flexibility and action-oriented responses; creates a
high rate of focused innovation; and encourages greater individual
involvement and team-based thinking.
They develop a musical metaphor, based on the differences between jazz
groups (for which read strategic improvising) and symphony orchestras
(strategic planning). Strategic improvising is not directionless - hence the
analogy is with the lead sheet of a standard jazz composition rather than
the avant garde variety. Strategic improvisers are jazz players in that they
are participative, they listen and are listened to; they are responsive -
like jazz musicians acting on musical ideas rather than slavishly following
the orchestral score; and they are communicative, organised into small teams
for lateral communications. It is no accident that a jazz group is typically
five to nine members, against as much as 110 for a fully fledged orchestra.
However, this book consists of more than flights of musical fancy. It
incorporates down-to-earth case study experiences of corporations like Taco
Bell, the fast food subsidiary of Pepsico, WL Gore and General Electric,
whose improvising cultures are admired.
From these it is shown that strategic decisions are best made at all
organisational levels, not exclusively at the top; that strategic
improvising involves a 'high frequency', and typically 'low impact'
approach, the taking of lots of initiatives rather than the agonising over
each one; and that whereas strategic plans are 'front loaded' - ie a lot of
effort is put in before managers actually act - strategic improvisers
believe the process can be improved by acting before they plan.
Published in the portable MBA series this book provides a useful summary of
the criticisms of traditional strategic planning. Whether it offers anything
original is more doubtful. It makes some elegant points and provides useful
advice. The suspicion remains, though, that strategic improvising is a
mishmash of empowerment, team development, core capabilities, and other
fads.

GUIDE TO INSOLVENCY IN EUROPE by Anthony Houghton and Nigel Atkinson
Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu International/CCH Editions Ltd Pounds 49.50 417
pages
THE NEED for a quick and succinct guide to the insolvency regimes of Europe
can rarely have been greater. Few insolvencies lack an international aspect
these days and professional advisers frequently need to know their way
around the laws and procedures of other European countries when tracing
assets situated there.
Deloittes offers a snapshot of the regimes of the 12 European Community
countries and six East European states, providing basic information on
recovery, rehabilitation, insolvency and debt collection.
Each country is dealt with in the same fashion. There are sections on the
types of business entity; reorganisation procedures; terminal procedures;
types of security and enforcement; debt collection procedures; sources of
law; and sources of information.
The book underlines the lack of harmonisation and limited uniformity between
the insolvency regimes of Europe. It is a handy guide for those wishing to
assess risk, pursue non-payment of debt or make claims in insolvency courts
abroad.
It is only a guide, however, and in most instances there can be no
substitute for taking local advice.

IMAGINIZATION: THE ART OF CREATIVE MANAGEMENT by Gareth Morgan Saga Pounds
19.95 347 pages
THE HALLMARKS FOR SUCCESSFUL BUSINESS by David Rail Mercury Books Pounds
14.95 279 pages
EVERY management which has experienced the traumas of rationalisation and
ferocious competition has to be interested in new forms of organisation.
Gareth Morgan's Imaginization argues that we are leaving the age of
'organised' organisations and moving into an era where the ability to
understand, facilitate and encourage processes of self-organisation will
become a key competence.
But how do you avoid ending up with bureaucratic management in another form,
rather than creating an organisation with a strong degree of self-organising
while still developing a corporate culture and necessary systems?
Morgan quotes the example of an Pounds 8bn company in the natural resources
industry renowned for a hard-nosed bottom line approach and cyclical nature.
Training and development are handled through a network of consultants hired
on a task-by-task basis to keep overheads to a minimum. Costs are charged
directly to line managers using their services. For general strategy, there
is also a small group of consultants. Successful organisations grow, but
ultimately size becomes a barrier to flexibility.
Can you grow while staying small? Yes, says Morgan, by replicating yourself
in a decentralised fashion, in the style of franchising and other retailing
systems.
In the fashion industry, building an organisation to exploit a market niche
is simpler because almost everything can be sub-contracted. What happens in
a mass production unit dependent on expensive machines and equipment? The
problems of remodelling organisations remains as intractable as ever.
The author admits there is no simplistic 'cure all' technique. His
contribution is to show how new ways of organising and dealing with change
can be developed, including teamwork. 'Imaginization', he argues 'offers a
means whereby people in everyday situations can explore and challenge their
taken-for-granted assumptions while opening new ventures for understanding
and action.'
Decentralisation, franchising, sub-contracting, networking, flexitime - all
these clearly work, but the reader still remains in some doubt how many
types of bureaucratic organisation allow scope for self-organisatlon
systems. Unless you are in the middle of strategic changes, complex
operations will still need to be carefully planned and well-organised.
The Hallmarks for Successful Business is a resourceful but partly flawed
confection. As a guide for smaller and medium-sized companies, based on
research and case material, it is unlikely to leave either struggling or
fast-growing firms satisfied as an approach.
Based on six so-called hallmarks - Focus/Direction, Customising, Partnering,
Personality, Quality and Systems - the key message is that finding and
keeping customers and building relationships for repeat business is the
first and most important step.
The advice that it is better to skip less important internal matters and
visit key customers should be learned, digested and repeated aloud daily by
every executive employed even by large companies. Smaller and medium-sized
businesses are unlikely to have much time for internal meetings; satisfying
their customers must be top priority, but continually delighting them, as
the author suggests, is perhaps asking the impossible.
The author's approach is to define his hallmarks as a model for managers
planning and implementing change which he believes, probably correctly, is
missing from many businesses.
Thus personality - the character of the businesses - calls for exceptional
vitality, vision and values to be developed and communicated to all target
audiences. A learning model based on questionnaires aims to establish
awareness, assessment and action in respect of all six hallmarks in order to
develop the business.
This could have been a powerful work given a more rigorous analysis of the
determinants of success of some of Britain's best run companies, as well as
lessons from some of the failues, and applying both more challengingly as
insights to development and growth.

EXTREME CONDITIONS by John Strohmeyer Simon &amp; Schuster Dollars 23 287 pages
A QUARTER of a century has passed since oil was discovered in northern
Alaska, leading to an explosion of economic activity in that icy wilderness.
The discovery brought untold riches to a region of 400,000 people. Over
those years, Alaska has accumulated a Dollars 13bn endowment fund, and today
it is the only US state with negative taxation: it actually pays money to
its people, rather than the other way round.
But was it worth it?
This well-researched, highly readable book suggests the answer might be
'no'. It provides a lurid account of the corruption and waste that came with
sudden wealth, and its appalling impact on the state's natives and natural
life.
Many of the effects are well known: the Exxon Valdez disaster, the
trans-Alaskan oil pipeline whose costs rocketed from Dollars 900m to Dollars
8bn, the Hickel Highway which ploughed a deep scar half way across the state
and now lies barely used.
But much of the book is about the more insidious effects of Alaska's riches.
Money went straight to the state legislature's head and spawned a series of
ill-fated state-backed programmes, like the Dollars 100m spent to create a
local agricultural industry - in a state locked in snow and ice most of the
year. The state also invested millions in a bank and a housing corporation,
both of which foundered.
More distressing in a way is Strohmeyer's account of destruction at the
grass roots. Native communities were virtually wiped out by the oil rush,
and only survived by mindlessly exploiting the forests and fisheries which
they were given as compensation. In the towns, development careered out of
control, and most urban centres are now blighted by vacant shopping malls.
An especially vivid chapter chronicles the ruination of the Kenai river,
once one of the world's finest salmon runs, now a mayhem of jetboats,
waterfront properties and unscrupulous fishing guides.
So intoxicated did Alaska become with big oil that the legislature dropped a
requirement that oil companies separately account for their activities in
the state. This was done to keep the oil companies happy, but it enabled
them to ship wealth out of the state at will. No one calculated the price of
oil development, so long as the money kept rolling in.
All very predictable, perhaps, and some readers may suspect the account is
exaggerated. But Strohmeyer - a journalist immigrant to Alaska - treats his
emotive subject with coolness and vivid detail which gives it a special
force.

THE R FACTOR by Michael Schluter and David Lee Hodder &amp; Stoughton, Pounds
6.99 276 pages
IT IS shocking to discover a book contentedly basking in a fantasy world,
when it purports to be a manual for social and personal amelioration.
Not that this is a worthless book; far from it. But it has an astonishing
disregard for the material and technological underpinnings of late 20th
century capitalism. It is happier floating broad scale ideas and moralities.
What the authors are trying to do is to generate a 'big new idea' which  -
they hope - will take off in business and political circles.
Their core idea is straightforward and without attachment to any
identifiable major ideological force. It runs like this. We now live in a
'mega-community' in which rapid flows of information, capital and labour
have put paid to those networks of stable personal encounters that gave rise
to a sense of community and lent life both meaning and security. Anomie and
alienation have sprung up in place of fulfilling human relationships. It is
claimed that this has not just social and moral costs, but is economically
inefficient too.
It is a message familiar from a hundred works of fiction and philosophy.
That is not to deny the book's veracity, only to pinpoint its weakness,
which is that of most exhortatory texts; it identifies the problems and even
proffers plausible solutions, but it is disconnected from any obvious means
of putting those solutions into practice.
We are offered some shaky assertions on which the rest of the edifice is
constructed. At one point the astonishing claim is made that 'the news
media, the fulcrum of western communications, is efficient because it is
omnipresent', which follows soon after a suggestion that we are all 'well
informed' by the news media of the 'mega-community'.
A moment's reflection tells us, surely, not that we are well informed but
that we are pulled by the nose by the mass media in certain directions and
utterly ignorant of other events and issues which the same media have
decided are not worth noticing. We are partially - and often badly -
informed.
However, the book's central flaw is too superficial an analysis of the
current technologically-induced ills of the contemporary world. The authors
correctly touch upon 'virtual reality' technology as purporting 'the
ultimate denial of encounter' (and therefore, in their terms, a threat to
human relationships). Yet they skate blithely on past it with never a glance
backwards after its first mention on page 33.
By the end of this century virtual reality will be a household presence; it
deserves more detailed consideration than that given here, if only because
the scale of the threat it poses to personal encounter as the central
element of human existence.
Nonetheless, there are moments, particularly in the second half, where the
authors raise suggestions that have immediate appeal.
One example is a proposed change to Britain's Mergers and Monopolies
Commission to restrain 'giantism', which in turn would, they claim, foster a
more relationship-oriented economy. 'In view of the massive power available
to the big plc, and the extreme difficulties of regulating it, it surely
makes sense to shift the burden of proof, so that the predator company (in a
takeover attempt) or both companies (in a proposed merger) must be able to
demonstrate a clear benefit in terms of efficiency, productivity, or the
national interest. The amalgamation of companies . . . should have to be
justified in ways meaningful to those outside the closed circle of the AGM.'
There are a dozen or more similarly tantalising proposals which deserve a
wider airing. Yet ultimately the book - and the charitable foundation which
has been set up to promote the 'building of relationships in public and
private life' - is probably doomed to become a victim of the social and
political ailments it so clearly identifies.

PURSUING HAPPINESS: AMERICAN CONSUMERS IN THE 20TH CENTURY by Stanley
Lebergott Princeton University Press Pounds 16.50, 188 pages
THE MESSAGE of Stanley Lebergott's book: to make yourself rich, you must not
increase your money but decrease your greed. Consumption, not income, is the
key to wealth.
Pursuing Happiness: American Consumers in the Twentieth Century charts the
story of how Americans spent their increased incomes since 1900. Lebergott
looks in detail at consumption in food, clothing, housing, utilities,
recreation and welfare. The book courts questions and revels in the chaos of
data that full replies would need. He writes lucid prose and analysis,
occasionally swamped by detail, but everywhere thought-provoking.
He focuses on these indicators because, he claims, we learn more from
looking at patterns of consumption than patterns of income. As civilisation
advances, according to Alfred Marshall's Principles of Economics, 'man's
wants rapidly become more subtle and more various.' The added value which
surrounds the consumer now is bewildering: lemon tea, vanilla coffee,
mechanical insurance, and, as Edward de Bono predicts in Sur/Petition added
access, such as designated parking space or road miles on priced roads for
particular makes of car.
Lebergott traces the evolution in the range and subtlety of consumer demand,
mixing short essays with tables of statistics. He writes trenchantly but
allows himself too many distractions; at times he is tilting at windmills,
particularly in his first chapter. But he manages a few sideswipes at the
economic establishment: from JK Galbraith, William Nordhaus and James Tobin
back to Thorstein Veblen, making the criticism telling by focusing on the
practical implications of an economic policy, always assuming that consumers
behave as economists predict.
The best chapter is a look at wealth through consumption rather than income.
This runs counter to street-level, or even board-level economics. The rich,
says Lebergott, have not become richer this century, because in 1990 they
are not consuming significantly more of the US output than they were in
1900.
He goes further. He ushers in the unlikely pairing of RH Tawney and John
Rawls, who advocates tax on expenditure rather than income because it is
levied according to how much one takes out of the common store of goods, and
not according to how much one contributes, assuming one's income is fairly
earned.
Elsewhere, the statistics support a general relief that we are not living in
1900, and along with it, a general belief in progress. In America in 1900
(at 1982 prices) one hour's work earned 50c of personal consumption; in
1929, Dollars 2.75; in 1960, Dollars 6.50; and in 1990, Dollars 9.75. The
average non-agricultural working week in America dropped from 60 hours in
1900 to 39.3 hours in 1990. But then Lebergott broadens the context: how
about the Kung bushmen, who put in a mere two-and-a-half six-hour days each
week? Then again, there are merchant bankers in New York who need make only
one or two decisions a year to survive handsomely.
The book never pretends to be exhaustive. The more fragmentary the details
marshalled by Lebergott, the more fascinating the questions they spawn. The
second half gives itself over to tables of indices and indicators.
The indices make compelling reading. For instance, the ratio of medicines to
funeral expenditures rose from 58% in 1900 to 852% in 1990. In itself, this
makes a diverting statistic; but in 1900 there were only 100,000 physicians
in private practice as against 586,000 in 1987 (or 1,315 physicians per
million Americans in 1900, and 2,207 per million in 1987).
Immediately we need other data: what constitutes a physician? How many
varieties of drugs were available? What constitutes a preventative drug
rather than a treatment drug? How did definitions of good health evolve over
the century? What influence did marketing, academic testing or public
relations have on medical expenditures?
Rather than looking at what isn't there, it is better to look at what is.
Everywhere Lebergott sets out the standards by which his particular social
economic approach has a claim on reality. Instead of pursuing happiness,
perhaps happiness is pursuing us. The Romans thought first of leisure
(otium) and then of business (NEGotium), a different formula for their
happiness quotient: that makes leisure the otium of the people.

INVESTMENT ILLUSIONS By Martin S Fridson Wiley, Pounds 12.99, 230 pages.
THE SUB-TITLE - 'A Savvy Wall Street Pro Explodes Popular Misconceptions
About the Markets' - makes one want to ask why, if this pro is so savvy, he
still writes books when he should have retired with millions long ago.
But Marty Fridson, a managing director of Merrill Lynch and editor of 'The
Journal of High Yield Bond Research', is a Wall Street pro in the sober
rather than the speculative sense. His aim in Investment Illusions is to
debunk several of the popular fallacies underlying the get-rich-quick
attitude to investing. To appreciate Fridson's dose of common sense, you
must either have doubts about the intelligence of the US private investor,
or believe that the nation's investment diet consists of a stream of
one-stop mail shops promising enrichment.
If either is the case, then Fridson's investment homilies are long overdue.
He advises investors to read annual reports for themselves and not to take
company accounts or management statements at face value. They should
distrust chartists, understand how mutual funds performance statistics can
distort the facts; and they should not pride themselves on being contrarian
when the majority may be right.
Sometimes, Fridson's exploded misconceptions go off with a bit of a whimper.
No, he says, the stock market is not always right to assume that a share
price will rise when the company's eminent chief executive retires or dies.
And no, not every potential winner benefits from a natural disaster (in
other words, don't buy every housebuilder in the wake of a hurricane - the
US bias shows throughout).
In the UK we seem to have fewer of the over-the-top investment gurus that
Fridson sends up. Such a one is Joe Granville, who besides appearing to get
most things wrong, dressed as a chicken and liked to drop his trousers to
allow his audience to read stock recommendations printed on his boxer
shorts.
Fridson's message is that there is no quick-fix to investment success. If a
stock looks cheap, Fridson would say that it probably deserves to stay cheap
because of the risks involved. For a private investor, 'the positive pay
back of patient, conservative investing is one of the few things you can
count on in the securities markets.'
More advice of the 'how to' rather than the 'how not to' variety would have
gone a long way to smoothing the platitudinous edge off many of Fridson's
investment maxims - even if this were as uncomplicated as Warren Buffet's
four characteristics of a sound investment: a growth market, a secure
franchise, positive cash flow, and tested management.
Fridson's book will not help you make much money, but it should at least
stop you losing any. Not every stockbroker manages that.

DOES FOREIGN EXCHANGE INTERVENTION WORK? by Kathryn M. Dominguez and Jeffrey
A. Frankel Institute for International Economics / Longman, Pounds 14.99 192
pages
AFTER THE events in the currency markets in the last year, it is a surprise
to come across a book that dares to ask whether foreign exchange
intervention can work. It is an even greater surprise to find its authors
coming up with an answer that sounds like 'Yes.'
There are times in the last 12 months when central bankers in the leading
industrial countries must have thought they were in the throes of a hideous
nightmare. Most of them have pledged to defend exchange rates within stated
or unstated boundaries. Few have succeeded.
Concerted intervention failed to stop the dollar falling to new historic
lows against the D-Mark in August 1992. Intervention by the Bank of England
failed to stop sterling falling out of the exchange rate mechanism the
following month. And intervention from the Bundesbank and the Bank of France
failed to prevent the effective suspension of the European Monetary System.
All that the latter did was to leave the French with a negative reserves
position, and the Germans with a fouled-up money supply.
But that does not mean that the principle of central bank intervention to
support or depress an exchange rate is dead. One forgets all too easily that
that late 1980s saw many successful operations by central banks first to
depress and then support the US dollar. More recently, the Federal Reserve
managed to confound the markets and prevent the yen falling through the Y100
level against the US currency, at least for a while.
And, as Kathryn Dominguez and Jeffrey Frankel say in this timely book,
central banks do not need huge reserves to outwit the speculators, even if
global currency turnover is now at a trillion dollars a day. 'The foreign
exchange market is a herd of steers, and central banks are herd dogs,' they
write, using an analogy from the American West. 'They bark and nip at the
heels of the steers, with the aim of moving the herd in the desired
direction.'
How, then, can the central banking dogs get the best performance out of the
pack?
The authors first ask why any governments should want to intervene in
foreign exchange markets at all - why the dogs have gone herding in the
first place.
It is a reasonable question. Leading monetarists have argued that the price
of a foreign currency reflects demand and supply in the market. By
definition it is the 'correct price.' Any attempt to subvert it ought to be
doomed in the long run.
Dominguez and Frankel partially concede this point when they say that
intervention is unlikely to work when it runs against the grain of
prevailing monetary policy. Intervention could not keep the French franc
within its former ERM bands because of the perception that French interest
rates were too high, given the level of unemployment in the country.
Conversely, the recent US intervention to depreciate the yen has only worked
because dealers believe that the Japanese government will introduce fiscal
measures to stimulate its economy. If Tokyo fails the dollar, the dollar
will fall.
However, intervention can sometimes be necessary - and succeed - whatever
the prevailing monetary policy.
The authors believe serious misalignments in exchange rates can occur
because of factors which are not related to underlying trade and investment
flows - and that central bankers need to respond.
They argue that a currency's exchange rate can 'overshoot,' for example,
after a change in money supply. In theory, a currency should depreciate by
an amount that is consistent with the injection of money into the market. In
practice, the currency falls further because international investors are
immediately discouraged by the prospect of investing in a currency with
lower short term interest rates.
Moreover, markets are prone to speculative bubbles which have little to do
with fundamental economic data. 'Distressing as it is for economists to
admit, many professional exchange rate forecasters and some traders do not
base their forecasts on any model based on money supplies or fundamental
economical variables,' they say. Instead, dealers use charts to extrapolate
past trends in price movements, and this can produce bandwagon effects.
These excessive currency fluctuations should worry governments: they make
trade relations more uncertain and can destabilise other markets. But what
can central banks do to ensure that their intervention is successful?
Much depends on the manner in which central banks intervene. Using data
released by the German, US and Swiss central banks, the authors discovered
that intervention was most effective in the 1980s when the authorities made
public statements to the news media, explaining exactly what they were
doing.
Moreover, if central banks want to manage exchange rates, Dominguez and
Frankel think they will have more luck if they operate flexible target
zones. 'A target zone is more likely to be sustainable when the central
parities are allowed to change over time in line with the fundamentals,'
they argue. There, in one sentence, is the epitaph on the ERM's gravestone.
The research that has gone into reaching these conclusions is highly
detailed. Beware of phrases like 'autoregressive conditional
heteroskedasticity.' Beware, too, of the algebra that stares from many
pages.
Nevertheless, the book should be useful to anyone who deals in, or writes
about, currency markets. It is a mine of intervention on the intervention
policies by central banks in the 1980s. And it traces the main arguments
over whether or not to influence exchange rates.

THE PAPER CHASE: A DECADE OF CHANGE AT THE DSS by Ivan Fallon HarperCollins,
Pounds 16.99. 162 pages
COMPUTERISATION projects in the public sector usually promise impressive
gains in efficiency and service to the public. All too often, the returns
are rather less impressive.
The computerisation of the UK Passport Agency was supposed to reduce staff
by 20 per cent and allow passports to be processed in five working days.
Earlier this year, the National Audit Office reported that computerisation
had failed to reduce staff costs and that it was still taking up to 20 days
to get a passport.
Meanwhile, the London Ambulance Service's Pounds 1.2m computer system for
despatching vehicles to emergencies was scrapped after claims that several
patients may have died because of delays in sending ambulances.
The installation of an on-line computer system for the payment of benefits
in the Department of Social Security - the subject of this book - is no
exception. Claimed to be the largest non-defence computerisation programme
outside the US, it has taken more than ten years to complete.
The cost, Pounds 1.8bn, is more than double the estimates at the start of
the project. The expected savings have dwindled and the promised reductions
in staff numbers have failed to materialise.
Worse, the payment of benefits continues to be criticised by the NAO, the
ombudsman and MPs, with unacceptable error levels in unemployment benefit
payments and delays in paying the new disability benefits launched last
year.
Major computer projects are notoriously hard to pull off, and the private
sector has had its own problems. The Stock Exchange's Taurus project, was
designed to allow paperless dealing and settlement of share bargains.
Conflicting user requirements made Taurus so unwieldy that it was cancelled
earlier this year.
At the heart of the public sector's difficulties - at least until recently -
has been a culture that favours administration and procedure rather than
management and change. Increasingly, ministers and mandarins have seen the
value of bringing in outside consultants as agents of change.
In the case of the DSS computer project, the consultants came largely from
Andersen Consulting, the management consultancy wing of accountants Arthur
Andersen. Ivan Fallon, deputy editor of the Sunday Times, documents their
efforts in this book, explaining their heroic efforts to force through a
strategy devised before their arrival against the resistance of many in the
department.
The delays and the cost over-runs would have been much greater had it not
been for the efforts of Andersen Consulting, the book claims. This
conclusion is hardly surprising, given that Andersen sponsored its
publication. No doubt the firm's clients will receive complementary copies.
The Paper Chase is not likely to be a best seller. Nor does it deserve to
be. It is a confusing and slipshod account which does little to illuminate
the issues.
Some sales are guaranteed by the copious lists of names of those involved in
the project. But even those who played starring roles in the epic may be
disconcerted when the story peters out at the end with only a cursory
evaluation of the success of such an important project.
There is a good book to be written about managing change in the civil
service. It would need to look at the obstacles to good management in
Whitehall, and the steps that have been taken to overcome them - including
the creation of executive agencies and the empowerment of managers. This
book isn't it.

THE RISE OF THE BRITISH PRESIDENCY by Michael Foley Manchester University
Press Pounds 12.99/Pounds 35 325 pages
CURIOUSLY, most businessmen think strong government is a good thing.
Schooled in macho corporate leadership, they equate government with business
and crave for dominant chief executives able to get a grip on 'UK plc'.
In reality, most businesses - indeed most citizens - are better off with
weak government, provided the rule of law is firmly established and their
diet is more than government contracts. But if it is a President they want,
a President they have got. The story of how and why is told in Michael
Foley's The Rise of the British Presidency.
Foley offers useful insights into the making of leaders of all kinds in a
soundbite, image-led age, even for readers not especially interested in the
academic debate on whether Britain has 'Cabinet' or 'prime-ministerial'
government.
Foley's key to modern presidentialism is 'spatial leadership' - a new
executive style in which authority comes from 'a sense of distance, and
occasionally detachment, from government'. Thatcher and Reagan were spatial
leaders par excellence: Reagan by endlessly attacking 'Washington' and
boasting of knowing nothing about the government he led; Thatcher by acting
as leader of the government and leader of the opposition at the same time.
So pervasive has cultivation of the image of the outsider become that the
most uncompromising insiders now have to present themselves as brash
interlopers. At the least, the modern leader needs to be a political
outsider; if he or she can be a social outsider too, so much the better.
John Major trades on the latter - defeating 'toff' Douglas Hurd for the Tory
leadership because he hadn't been to Eton; Thatcher made the most of the
former, emphasising her break with a generation of consensus politics.
To succeed as an outsider, you need to be a populist. Foley calls it
'designer populism', characterised by highly-publicised political
intereference in the government machine 'not in the style of a managing
director, but more in the theatrical mould of a deus ex machina enhancing
the political position of the premier at the expense of the organisational
integrity of the government.'
Enter Reagan the tax cutter and Thatcher the Brussels slayer. Enter, too,
the designer populism of much modern business marketing, pitting dynamic
'new' brands and companies against unresponsive 'old' products and outfits.
Corporate observers might also draw parallels with Foley's theme of the
growing divorce between leadership and policy.
For the student of politics, Foley has some important points to make about
the way prime-ministerial power is acquired and exercised. He argues
plausibly that the televisual personalisation of leadership enables prime
ministers to circumvent their Cabinet and party colleagues to an
unprecedented degree. Moreover, the cult of the outsider necessarily pits
the PM against his or her party and governmental elites, at least
rhetorically and often in matters of substance too.
Less convincing, however, is Foley's argument that 'presidentialism' has
produced a long-term increase in the profile and power of the prime
minister.
It is based on the contemporary fallacy that the modern age began 30 years
ago. Churchill and Lloyd George appear briefly in the book, only to be
dismissed as exceptional because they were war-time leaders. Gladstone,
Disraeli and Pitt do not even make the index. Yet judged by their executive
dominance and popular profile in their own day, any of those three could be
set against Thatcher or Reagan.
John Morley, writing in the 1880s, described the authority of the prime
minister as 'not inferior to that of a dictator, provided the House of
Commons will stand by him.' Gladstone was a giant in his day; between 1868
and 1892 - they had long careers in those days - elections were virtually
referendums on his leadership and policies.
Back in the 1780s, Pitt the Younger was dubbed 'The Minister', so
overwhelming was his dominance. A century before that, Louis XIV was
consolidating absolute monarchy in France with the aid of political and
propaganda techniques all too recognisable in the Courts of Margaret and
Ronald. Peter Burke's brilliant book The Fabrication of Louis XIV, a tale of
populist politics, media manipulation, and acting for the public stage,
should be compulsory reading for any politician or advertising executive.
President Louis, alas, was so busy fighting wars to accumulate glory and
popularity that he had little time for humdrum trade or the welfare of his
people. Plus ca change . . .

THE REFORMING ORGANISATION By Nils Brunsson &amp; Johan P Olsen Routledge Pounds
12.99 240 pages
The Reforming Organisation is an excellent example of current European
thinking about organisational rejuvenation or renewal. Modern organisations
often believe it is possible to change organisational structures and
processes by rational choice and design. Indeed, organisations often go
through a series of different reforms.
The success or failure of such initiatives is never evaluated, and the
failure of old reforms that supposedly make new reforms necessary does not
seem to reduce the belief in reform in general as an approach to
accomplishing change.
The Reforming Organisation sets itself a threefold agenda. First, why it is
that reform efforts occur. Second, why reformers propose specific solutions.
Third, the effects of reforms. The authors' contention is that the origins,
content and effects of reforms are best explained, not by the rational model
so loved in the US, but by environmental and other external factors. Their
conclusion is that attempted reform often stabilises and legitimises common
conceptions in organisations, rather than leading necessarily to real
change.
But true optimism about organisational learning and renewal can only arise
from a thorough understanding of what condemns most organisations to
sub-optimal performance. The Reforming Organisation is unlikely to star in
the show-biz gravy trail of management consultancy, but it is essential for
anyone interested in organisational transformation.

CONFESSIONS OF A UNION BUSTER By Martin Jay Levitt with Terry Conrow Crown
Publishing Dollars 22.50 302 pages
THOSE WHO believe that unions are the source of all evil in the workplace
should read this book. They will find that managements can stoop to far
dirtier tricks than organised labour.
'Marty' Levitt seemed to have the most caricatured of American lives: at 25
in 1969 he had founded an executive recruitment firm billing Dollars 100,000
a year, was paying himself Dollars 25,000 a year, had been married, divorced
and was in a psychiatric hospital sinking into depression.
Then he noticed a job advertisement in the Wall Street Journal for an
'employee relations consultant'. He had next to no relevant qualifications,
but managed to talk the top executives at John Sheridan Associates into
hiring him for their office in his home town of Cleveland, Ohio.
From then on, whenever there was an attempt to organise labour to vote for
the creation of a union, Levitt was vying to be there, plotting campaigns,
speaking to staff, developing strategies. His responsibility was to senior
executives, his job to keep collective action out.
In the next 20 years he worked on some 200 campaigns around the US,
apparently losing just five to the unions. During that time he generated -
and frittered away - vast sums in billings and expenses from managements all
too eager to pay.
The surprise of this book is just how organised and ruthless the anti-union
industry has become. Since the 1960s, it has grown into a sector estimated
to be billing more than Dollars 1bn a year, which the author now thinks of
as unscrupulous.
In Levitt's case, it meant using telephone taps, spreading malicious and
often untrue gossip, intimidating staff and gaining access to their
personnel files regardless of ethics.
His favoured strategy was to divide the workforce, alienating supervisers or
other middle-grade employees and forcing them to be the anti-union
mouthpieces on threat of losing their jobs.
While union staff had to meet secretly at anti-social hours and away from
the workplace, he would have the advantage of offices on the premises, and
the right as a management person to demand that staff carried out his
commands. Much of that time was idled away, and the evenings spent in hard
drinking sessions with his paymasters.
He learns how supposedly objective employee attitude surveys are manipulated
 -not only to win new business by identifying signs of apparent staff
discontent, but even by identifying from among the 'anonymous' respondents
those likely to be the union sympathisers.
There are many frustrations with the book. The style - no doubt heavily
influenced by the ghost-writer - is at times banal and repetitive. It is
also suspiciously rich in detail, to the extent of apparently recalling
perfectly descriptions and events from the 1970s and 1980s.
Levitt's ego shines through. Even as a 'convert' with union sympathies, he
cannot resist boasting about his expertise in bashing labour or even his
more recent prowess as a defector for unions. It would have been useful to
read a little about the campaigns which he lost instead of a list of
'victories'.
The explanation for his switch in allegiance is given less than a chapter in
the book, offering little insight into what motivated the change.
The reader never really gets much of the author's inner thoughts about
unions and management. What comes across is a rather unthinking,
unreflective individual motivated by earning large sums - and yet,
ironically, someone unable to manage his money, his personal relationships
or any aspect of his life outside work as he degenerated into alcoholism.
His partial candour is nonetheless a valuable and rare glimpse at an
ill-explored activity.

LOST TYCOON: THE MANY LIVES OF DONALD J. TRUMP By Harry Hurt III Weidenfeld
&amp; Nicolson Pounds 18.99 447 pages
DONALD J. Trump may never have existed. Rather than a flesh and blood
figure, he was perhaps the creation of a marketing genius who managed to
introduce a brand name to a class of products - real estate, casinos - that
had never been branded before. The result, for a while, was a triumph.
As Fortune magazine once wrote of The Donald: 'That name indisputably adds
value.' It went on: 'There is undeniably a Trump mystique. Some people love
him, others despise him, but everybody talks about him. He has become a cult
hero for many people around the world who seem to regard this flamboyant
billionaire as the most heartening example of the American dream come true
since Ross Perot.'
The brand was built on a unique blend of money and chutzpah. Take the yacht,
for instance. The Trump Princess, 282ft long, featured among other things a
helipad, a 16-seat main dining room with a gurgling waterfall, chamois
ceilings and onyx shower stalls.
The hotels were classy too, if you liked pink marble.
There were just two problems with this approach, but they were big ones. The
first was that the Trump name was subject to the law of diminishing returns.
It was one thing to be associated with a glossy new tower block on Fifth
Avenue, the home of kings and movie stars. But a fleet of clapped-out Boeing
727s running the shuttle service between New York and Washington was another
matter.
The second big problem was that The Donald's generous life-style depended on
an endless river of cash, and that in turn rested with those nice folks at
Citibank and the Chase Manhattan. When things started to get sticky for them
in the late 1980s, the Trump brand rapidly lost its allure. If The Donald
wasn't a zillionaire, he was nothing.
Lost Tycoon is one of those biographies that is in perfect harmony with its
subject: tacky, and a little overweight. Its author's previous bestseller
was called Texas Rich, and there is no denying that this latest oeuvre is
strongly flavoured with soap. Adjectives spray around like machine gun fire:
'A short, sharp tongued, hard drinking Jewish gaming industry gadfly in his
late fifties, Glasgow, whose birth name was Jerry Segal, came from a
moderately wealthy family whose money he had invested in a variety of
ill-fated ventures in the concrete industry.'
And so on.
The narrative is divided into three parts - 'The Crash', 'The Art of the
Spiel' and, simple but to the point, 'Best Sex Ever Had'. It's rich with
recreated dialogue and startling insights, such as the detailed account of
an event which, according to The Donald, never happened: the removal of his
surplus fat by a plastic surgery technique known as liposuction.
'The procedure. which takes a little more than two hours, is similar to
coring Swiss cheese.'
By the closing chapters, the reader begins to feel a strange and unsettling
sensation: sympathy for The Donald. Can he really be that dreadful? And
could someone with the intellectual, emotional, moral and personal
shortcomings described here really have succeeded in building an empire -
even one as fragile as the Trump Organisation?
One of the few really intriguing moments, in my UK edition at least, comes
in a footnote which bears the heavy imprint of the lawyers, and which for no
apparent reason ends in mid sentence: 'As a woman, I felt violated, as the
love and tenderness which he normally' . . . and then nothing. The editors
seem overcome with emotion at this point, since the next few pages are
splattered with errors.
Trump was a great brand name for New York in the late 1980s. For the austere
1990s, though, we need something different. Instead of a plump American,
better to go for a lean, hard Hispanic. A warrior figure, leading a small
but ruthless band of mercenaries who are ready to sell their swords to the
highest bidder. You could call him something like Jose Ignacio Lopez de
Arriortua.
But the marketing men had better hurry. This brand name might have an even
shorter shelf life than The Donald's.

EUROPEAN COMPETITIVENESS edited by Kirsty H Hughes Cambridge University
Press Pounds 29.95 312 pages
THE LEARNING IMPERATIVE edited by Robert Howard Harvard Business School
Press Dollars 29.95 352 pages
COMPETITIVENESS can be analysed at the level of individual firms, of an
industry, of a country or group of countries. And the word 'competitiveness'
itself is understood and used in many ways, though there are two broad
categories: the first views competitiveness as a question of relative
efficiency as reflected in productivity and productivity growth; the second
views competitiveness as reflecting relative international trade
performance.
Recognising the complex nature of the subject, European Competitiveness uses
all these concepts and perspectives to examine patterns of competitiveness
within Europe, as well as between Europe and its main competitors, the US
and Japan.
The essays focus on aspects of the internationalisation process, to examine
some of its key characteristics, with special attention to multinational
activities of firms in Europe, their organisational form and location
decisions.
The role of technology in competitiveness is analysed, and the book
discusses likely changes which will result from increased integration of
various markets. Finally, it discusses the role of key factors such as the
public sector and national culture, which will continue to differentiate
countries and to shape their competitiveness.
The overall message of the book is not earth-shatteringly different from
conventional wisdom, but what it does contribute is academic rigour and
thoroughness.
Relentless change demands relentless improvement. To achieve relentless
improvement faster and faster, various panacea have been attempted and found
fashionable. The most popular of these is Quality Management, the most
recent is Learning Organizations, the concern of Learning Imperative, a
selection of 17 essays on the subject from the management journal, Harvard
Business Review.
And what, pray, are Learning Organizations? Well, there is no clear
consensus among the luminaries whose work is gathered in the volume, the
first essay of which was originally published only three years ago, but that
does not reduce the variety of perspectives and routes offered.
There is some agreement, though. All the contributors see a dynamic and
volatile economy in which competition is getting tougher, technology is
moving ever faster, customers and business partners are becoming more
demanding.
All the contributors agree that the only source of continuous competitive
advantage is the people of an organisation, provided one somehow manages to
motivate them to learn faster than the competition, and to harness and apply
that learning across the whole of the organisation.
Easier said than done, even at the individual level; the thorny question is,
as one would expect, at the organisational level. The Learning Imperative
gathers together much American discussion of the subject (including the
single and highly influential non-American contribution to American
discussion by the Japanese scholar lkujiro Nonaka). However, it does not
even indicate the European discussion of the subject, which has taken place
largely in parallel to the American discussion.

CRISIS, STABILISATION AND ECONOMIC REFORM by Michael Bruno Clarendon Press,
Oxford, Pounds 25 300 pages
THIS HAS been a dreadful year for the European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development. The events of the summer, culminating in the departure of Mr
Jacques Attali, the bank's founding president, dealt a serious blow to the
bank's reputation. But there was another loss which may, in the end, prove
more serious.
The EBRD has, understandably, found it difficult to lend to commercially
viable projects in eastern Europe. But there is one commodity it should be
distributing in abundance: sound advice. Last March, the bank announced that
it had found a new chief economist, whose international reputation and
experience should have enabled the bank to lift its profile on the
prescriptive policy circuit.
Professor Michael Bruno, then Melchior Professor of International Economic
Policy at the Hebrew University at Jerusalem, is one of those few academics
who speak with real authority about the real world, and can draw on
practical experience when giving policy advice. His new book, Crisis,
Stabilisation and Economic Reform, demonstrates why his appointment last
March was such a coup for the EBRD, particularly as, given Mr Attali's
desire to increase the bank's activities in Russia, his appointment occurred
just when the Russian government finally appeared willing to embrace reform
and stabilisation.
Drawing heavily on his first-hand experience as governor of the Bank of
Israel between 1986 and 1991, but not skimping on the economic analysis, Mr
Bruno provides a powerful and comprehensive analysis of why some countries
get into hyperinflationary difficulties. At the heart of all the
hyperinflations he examines, both in Israel and Latin America, is the
political and distributional difficulties that weak governments face in
sharing out the costs of negative economic shocks and the temptation to
resort to monetary deficit financing instead. The book charts the essential
elements of workable stabilisation plans in these regions and countries and
then extends its analysis to eastern Europe.
Based particularly on the Israeli experience, Mr Bruno lists six ingredients
for an economically and politically sustainable stabilisation effort in
eastern Europe:
Stabilisation should come in the wake of past failed attempts to control
inflation;
The central leadership should be strong and united, and be able to offer the
prospect of external aid in return for successful reform;
The programme of stabilisation measures and structural reform must stand or
fall as one package;
There must be a consensus among economists in the country that the proposed
programme is the right one;
It must have transparent ingredients which offer potential welfare
improvements for the whole society;
The programme must be perceived as enhancing the chances of survival of the
political leadership.
Where the book fails is in making the case that the analogy works, in spite
of the huge differences between the political problems of stabilisation in
essentially market-based and liberal societies such as Israel and those in
the former Soviet Union. At first sight Russia appears to meet all the
ingredients above for successful reform, but the Russian government, in
spite of the availability of substantial western aid and advice, has not
been willing to try. Presumably this can be explained, in part, because the
huge dislocation caused by trying to stabilise a non-market economy means
that it is not worth taking the risk. In any case, Russia does not have the
essential components of a civil society which enable the government to sell
and sustain the case for economic reform.
While Mr Bruno's book does not help us fully to understand the Russian
dilemma, he is presumably currently on the case. But not at the EBRD. For,
as the Attali crisis developed, Mr Bruno withdrew his candidacy and has
subsequently been appointed the World Bank's new chief economist. But the
Russian government will still be hearing from him - unless, that is, the
difficulties of building a viable Palestinian economy prove too powerful a
distraction.

FT  28 SEP 93 / The FT Review of Business Books (13): Why bankers get it
wrong / Economics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MONTAGNON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GOING FOR BROKE by Russell Taylor Simon and Schuster, Pounds 17.50 320 pages
MAYNARD KEYNES described bankers as 'the most romantic and the least
realistic of men.' For all their air of pin-striped authority they seem
adept at losing money. It is not just last year's Pounds 240m loss and
Pounds 2.5bn bad debt provision at Barclays after its disastrous forays into
UK property lending. Recent banking history has been plagued by blunder and
scandal, from the Calvi affair in Italy to Latin American lending, from junk
bonds in the US to Robert Maxwell. Why do bankers fall into these traps? A
book which attempts to answer this question is worthy of serious attention.
Going for Broke only partly lives up to its promise. It is a disordered work
stuffed full of anecdote and personal reminiscence, delivered at a
breathless pace.
It is a pity that Mr Taylor had not allowed himself time for more sober
reflection. He might then also have avoided the error of referring on page
288 to Mr Henry Wallich, the late federal Reserve Board Governor, as Mr Eli
Wallich. Monte dei Paschi di Siena, the Italian bank, is spelled wrongly
several times in the text and even in the index. This is inexplicable since
it was a founding shareholder in Italian International Bank, which the
author ran for many years.
One is thus tempted to attribute bankers' failures to their lack of
attention to detail. But that would be unfair since the book points to a
deeper, structural weakness in the industry. Since the banking crises of the
1920s, banks have been over-protected by their regulators. There is thus
little to constrain their ambitions. Competition has become all the more
reckless in a world in which wholesale money is freely available in the
interbank market, commercial banks have lost touch with their customers and
investment bankers no longer have a personal stake in their business.
Taylor picks out Citibank, with its overweaning ambition, and Midland of the
UK as object lessons about what has gone wrong. Such was the self-delusion
of Mr Walter Wriston of Citibank that he believed that countries can never
go bust. The Latin American debt crisis proved this notion to be at least an
economical version of the truth. By the time it broke, however, Citibank had
managed to spread a huge amount of risk around the banking system through
the convenient device of the syndicated loan.
Midland, by contrast, lost its way as its traditional British industrial
customers went into decline. It tried to find a new approach through its
purchase with Crocker, but quickly found it was out of its depth.
The author also correctly frets about banks' tendency to rely on security to
back up their loans, even though it is of uncertain value. He is dubious
about cash-flow as an alternative yardstick of creditworthiness, not least
because banks cannot be sure that their corporate borrowers will always have
paying customers to generate the cash-flow needed to service debt. In the
end, the banker's skill boils down to knowing and understanding the
customer. Hambros Bank lost no money lending to Ivar Kreuger, the Swedish
match king, because it did not like his yellow socks.
Relying on judgments like this becomes all the harder when formal credit
analysis has become a tool of marketing, designed to help banks sell loans
rather than protect them from making bad ones. The best way of preventing
that, as Taylor rightly concludes, would be for them once again to run the
risk of bankruptcy.

<TEXT>
AUSTIN ROBINSON: THE LIFE OF AN ECONOMIC ADVISER Sir Alec Cairncross St
Martins Press Pounds 40 198 pages
THIS BOOK has a strong flavour of autobiography. Sir Alec Cairncross has
drawn heavily on Austin Robinson's personal papers, supplemented by long
letters from him, commenting on the draft. Much of the best in the book
comes from the horse's mouth.
It is the story of one of the last of the great Cambridge economists who
worked closely with Keynes between the wars. No theorist, Robinson's lasting
contributions came mainly as an organiser, helping to found the Central
Statistical Office, launching the International Economic Association,
participating in the creation of the Overseas Development Institute, editing
the Economic Journal for over a quarter of a century. He also flew the
earliest flying boats, taught a juvenile Maharajah, and advised governments
for over a decade.
Drawn to Keynes' Cambridge circus (as it afterwards became known) Robinson
made his mark by, among other things shattering the 'Widow's Curse' fallacy
which had caught Keynes' imagination. This held that when a businessman made
profits, those profits would not be depleted because by spending them they
would force up prices, creating profits for other businessmen. Robinson is
generally supposed to have been the one who pointed out that output might
rise instead of prices. As he said: 'If an entrepreneur loaded with profits
decided on his way home to have a shoe shine, was the effect solely to raise
the price of shoe shines, rather than affect the number of shoes shone?'
Although he contributed a good deal to the economic debates of his time, not
least with his book Monopoly and early work on development economIcs, an
interest stirred by two years in India and an extended visit to the Zambian
Copper Belt, he has not left a clearly indelible mark on economic thought in
the way that has his more theoretical wife, Joan. His gift was for rigorous
analysis of a particular problem without recourse to an overarching theory
but with the clear determination to find answers which could be translated
into policy. So it is right that this book should be subtitled The Life of
an Economic Adviser.
It seems he first flirted with the idea of working in government as early as
1931. That came to nothing, and it was the war which brought him in. He was
influential in the preparation of the first set of national accounts and
heavily involved in translating lessons learnt from war-time planning into
peace-time purposes.
Robinson doubted that investment could be directed by price signals alone.
Planning could regulate disequilibria 'by administrative and budgetary
action and by control of investment, more quickly than would happen through
the ordinary operations of the price mechanism'. In this, and in other
ideas, such as his espousal of import controls and complacency about the
sustainability of growth, he marched with the times.
It is as a product of his times that some of his observations make
entertaining reading. On a comparison of Indian and African servants: 'These
(African) people are incredibly inept and noisy servants and clat around the
room . . . in India where servants are perfect we say 'this is evidently a
servile race. They can't rule themselves'; in South Africa we say 'these
people can't even lay a table. How can they run a country?''
There is less about his wife than might have been expected. From the war
time on it seems they lived apart in a large Cambridge house. We learn that
this most famous of female economists 'slept, summer and winter, in the
garden shed, which was open to the winds, while the tits lined their nests
with her hair'.
In spite of some repetition this is a useful guide to the atmosphere of
inter-war and post-war intellectual economic life. It is not hagiography but
a tribute, enlivened by the diaries and letters of the man himself.

THE MAN WHO MADE LITTLEWOODS: THE STORY OF JOHN MOORES by Barbara Clegg
Hodder &amp; Stoughton Pounds 17.99 239 pages
THIS biography of John Moores, the Littlewoods Pools billionaire, is not an
infallible guide to voracious wealth-making. But it offers pointer after
pointer - three of which shout out from the earliest pages.
First, scrutinise the field and calculate the odds. John Moores' second job
after he was thrown out of the Post Office was as a trainee telegraphist
with the Commercial Cable Company. He wrote later: 'Somebody worked it out
that more millionaires have come from telegraphists than from any other
trade. There may be something in it]'
Although he soon abandoned his career as a telegraphist, Moores did plenty
of research into the subject of wealth. He compiled an archive on 'success.'
According to his youngest sister: 'He wanted to read the lives of important
men who'd got to the top. He wanted to know what they did, what they said.
Always he wanted to know how. He couldn't be bothered with trivialities.'
Second pointer: the greatest business fortunes are not always built on
original ideas. You can copy someone else's - but get in fast and do it
slightly better. Although Littlewoods Pools eventually generated the biggest
private fortune in the history of gambling, the idea of a football pool, in
which punters strive to win huge jackpots by predicting the results of
soccer matches, was not originally Moores'.
He heard of someone else doing it, a man in Birmingham, but not very
successfully. So Moores and two friends set up their own version with a
start-up fund of Pounds 50 each (this was 1924).
Third pointer: make sure there is a good woman behind you to stiffen your
resolve. In its first year Littlewoods ran into predictable difficulties,
and Moores offered to buy his partners out for what they had by then put in,
Pounds 200 each.
But first he asked his wife, Ruby. She urged him to carry on. 'If you
don't,' she told him, 'you will never quite convince yourself that another
few months might not have turned the tide. I'd sooner be the wife of a man
who has gone broke than a man who is haunted by regret.' So belts were
tightened. The gross receipts of Littlewoods Pools for the last week of its
first season, May 2 1925, were Pounds 54 8s 6d (Pounds 925 today) from which
Moores took a 10 per cent commission to cover expenses.
Littlewoods became a gusher, generating enormous quantities of cash
virtually from thin air. But Moores did not stick to gambling. He went on to
establish a formidable private business that in addition to Littlewoods
Pools included six mail-order companies and 120 chain stores. In 1992 group
turnover (including the pools business) was Pounds 2.7bn. By coincidence,
Fortune puts John Moores' personal wealth at Dollars 2.7bn.
Like many of the super-wealthy, Moores - still alive, at 97 - is a bit
enigmatic. His personality was once likened to that of Jesus Christ's.
Someone else said: 'He made Genghis Khan look . . . civilised.' This duality
is well-captured by Barbara Clegg, who describes Moores' ability to achieve
two results at once, often by pitting managers - or sons - one against the
other.
'He was a staunch Conservative,' she writes, 'but at the same time he was
admired by a grandson for his 'socialist capitalism.' He was in many ways a
self-centred man, but his life was geared to looking after and providing for
other people.' Mentally, she says, he was innovative and far-sighted in
business, more than capable of looking ahead to the century's end. Yet his
values and emotions remained largely fixed in the era of his late Victorian
boyhood.
Perhaps the key to Moores' money-making genius was his fixity of purpose.
Once, years ago, he asked an assistant buyer to do something. The man
declared it to be impossible. 'Mr John just sat there,' this person said
later. 'Then he said: 'There is nothing impossible in Littlewoods'.' In
March 1971 John Moores spelt out to his executives his basic policy, which
he said had never changed. First: give all customers real value for money,
consistently. Second: give all employees the opportunity to contribute to
the growth of the company, and to develop their own abilities to the full,
with every prospect of promotion and financial recognition. Third (but only
third, and then 'by the grace of God') to make a profit.

INFORMATION SYSTEMS OUTSOURCING:MYTHS, METAPHORS AND REALITIES by Mary C
Lacity and Rudy Hirschheim John Wiley Pounds 24.95, 272 pages
FEW DECISIONS in corporate computing can be as politically charged or as
spattered with hyperbole as a resolution to move to facilities management,
or 'outsourcing'. This volume in Wiley's information systems series
illuminates the part office politics and the hidden agenda plays in what
should be a seemingly straightforward strategic decision.
Outsourcing is the use of an outside agency to fulfil a company's data
processing requirements to an agreed service level for an agreed fee. In
some cases, the agency takes its customers' computers and data processing
staff on to its own books; in others, the company retains ownership of staff
and machines.
The UK government's 'market testing' plans - where a department's ability to
deliver IT and other services efficiently are to be measured against the
market alternative - are outsourcing on a grand scale.
Whatever the flavour of outsourcing, the advantages to the customer are
perceived to be a cap on information technology costs and freedom from the
chore of running a department which may have nothing to do with the
company's core business. These have powerful appeal to chief executives who
see the information systems(IS) department as a burden on resources. Twenty
per cent of Fortune 500 companies are likely to sign outsourcing deals by
1994, it is said.
The dangers are that the company loses control of its crown jewels - its
data - and its source of competitive advantage - its information technology
strategy. At a personal level, the company's information systems(IS) manager
stands to lose his or her job in the changeover.
Anyone wrestling with whether to outsource his or her organisation's data
processing operations would do well to digest Mary Lacity and Rudy
Hirschheim's carefully researched study. The two academics analysed 13
companies where outsourcing had been examined as an option. Their
conclusions cast doubt on many popularly held views of outsourcing and
should help to cut through the hyperbole.
They suggest, for example, that publicly available information about
outsourcing presents an overly optimistic view: 'Outsourcing is not a
panacea for information systems problems,' they say. 'Several participants
suffered severe service degradation and paid significant excess charges that
negated expected savings.'

JAPAN'S CAPITALISM: CREATIVE DEFEAT AND BEYOND by Shigeto Tsuru Cambridge
University Press Pounds 24.95 277 pages
ONCE UPON a time, a Japanese village had three brothers, Strong, Rich and
Warmhearted.
At first Strong was the dominant force, using his might to make things
right, until age began to tell, his strength faded and he yielded his power
to Rich. Rich built a big empire, but his wealth was stored in warehouses
which were burned to the ground in a fire, leaving him penniless.
Warmhearted, meanwhile, had been studying medicine, which knowledge was put
to good use in diagnosing, isolating and treating the epidemic that raged
after the fire, saving countless lives.
Warmhearted became the real and lasting hero of the village, commemorated by
a statue in its centre. 'Warmhearted triumphed over Strong and Rich,' notes
Shigeto Tsuru, concluding the children's story.
The inclusion of such fairytales tells a lot about Tsuru's broad and
humanitarian approach. Of his scholarship there can also be no doubt.
Distinguished as both a practical and an academic economist, his
understanding of the politics as well as the economics of war and peace was
honed successively as student leader against the Japanese military; as a
Harvard academic assisting Gottfried Haberler and Wassily Leontief; as
Japanese wartime infantry private and later foreign ministry official; under
the same roof as his wife's uncle and Lord Privy Seal Marquis Kido when Kido
was attempting to end the war; as vice minister on the post-war Economic
Stabilisation Board; then as professor of economics and later president of
Hitotsubashi University.
This book is quite simply the best history yet written of Japan's
Phoenix-like rise from the defeat and ashes of the War. It is spare but
incisive. Tsuru's mastery of sources is marvellous. He has consulted
dry-as-dust government documents, corporate reports, classical and modern
economists, the oriental classics, fairytales - even modern journalism. He
has distilled their essence, added the lessons of his own practical
experience and political understanding, and turned the account into English
prose that is easy, even sweet to read.
One of the pleasant things is to see remembered with affection unsung heroes
such as Wolf Ladejinsky, who helped in the post-war land reforms and went on
to assist Taiwan, then India. Tsuru carefully explains important and
powerful Japanese practices like window guidance (the Bank of Japan's
dealing out of credit) and administrative guidance (under which government
agencies without explicit legal authority direct or induce private Concerns
to take or refrain from actions).
He concludes: 'It may well be that the traditional dislike of open legal
procedures in the social climate of Japan has nurtured the practice of
resolving an issue through informal, quasi-voluntary jawboning and
finger-pointing of the type peculiar to Japan.' He also offers a valuable
assessment of the extent to which Japan relied on export-led growth.
In spite of its slimness, there are few deficiencies in the history. Tsuru
has illuminating insights into how Japan succeeded in building its sewing
machine, camera and watch industries and how collusion between government
and manufacturers helped nurture the growth. It would, however, have been
nice also to have examples of the failures of the Ministry of International
Trade and Industry in guiding Japan's miracle.
Tsuru's natural sympathies are with the left, revealed in his quotation of
John Ruskin's address to manufacturers at Bradford in 1859: 'You must
remember always that your business, as manufacturers, is to FORM THE MARKET
as much as to supply it . . . But whatever happens to you, this, at least,
is certain, that the whole of your life will have been spent in corrupting
public taste and encouraging public extravagance.'
He expresses great anger at Japan's other GNP or 'Great National Pollution',
righteously and rightfully indignant at the way the Inland Sea, a rich
natural treasure-house of resources, has been violated by heavy industry.
The author's concluding concern is whether modern Japan will become
Warmhearted, or instead be selfishly Rich. In Tsuru's view, this is probably
the most important part of the book. It is certainly the most
thought-provoking, but also the weakest. He needed more space to expand his
ideas. The greatest weakness is the gap between the author's five
prescriptions for future Japanese policy - essentially that it should be a
centre for excellence and promotion of international understanding and aid -
and the real world of grubby politics.
His highly pertinent comments on the US-Japan Security Treaty, and his
criticisms of the GNP Growthmanship of Rich Japan, lose their impact
precisely because his ideal world is so far from the real one, whereas. in
the historical sections Tsuru was 'at nose length' from the major events.
Historians, political scientists and economists alike should nevertheless be
grateful for this account, and practising politicians and bureaucrats in and
outside Japan would do well to consider its implications. Right to the end
Tsuru is cheering Warmhearted. He mixes folk-wisdom with scholarship,
remembering that it is 'the sun, not the north wind, (that) may make the
traveller take off his coat.'

THE FINANCIAL TIMES GUIDE TO USING THE FINANCIAL PAGES Romesh Vaitilingam
with additional material by Emma Tucker Financial Times/Pitman Pounds
12.95/Pounds 30 216 pages
EVERY DAY, a torrent of financial statistics floods across the pink pages of
the Financial Times. This guide contains an example of every regular table
the paper publishes, with a clear summary of each table's purpose and
sources.
The book provides more than this background information on each table,
however. It also contains a succinct guide to the way the data captured in
the tables reflects the wider forces shaping the activities of economies and
markets. Romesh Vaitilingam, a freelance writer, has managed to steer clear
of financial markets jargon whilst also achieving accuracy and conciseness.
Additional material is provided by Emma Tucker, an economics reporter at the
FT.
Their approach ensures the book's permanence. Even though the format of
individual FT tables changes from time to time, the definitions and insight
the book provides will remain of lasting value to readers.

Question - Economic History

THE IRISH ECONOMY: RESULTS AND PROSPECTS by Ronnie Munck Pluto Press Pounds
10.95 177 pages
THE POLITICIANS have not done too well in trying to end the troubles in
Northern Ireland, and Ronnie Munck's The Irish Economy: Results and
Prospects makes a stab at some alternative scenarios.
Could economic logic ultimately drive the two parts of Ireland into some
modus vivendi, in the context of the Single European Market? Possibly yes;
but then other putative solutions have been singularly unsuccessful over the
past 20 years.
Munck is a sociologist at the University of Ulster and he writes from a
radical perspective, yet he floats notions rather than dogmatic assertions,
leaving the impression that he is planting seeds and not surveying the final
harvest.
Books abound on the economic history of the Republic of Ireland and Northern
Ireland. This effort endeavours to trace and quantify their economic
development in parallel, to identify similarities and some differences, and
to hint that an economic coming together might be for the common good.
The trouble is that there is no accepted definition of the common good in an
Irish context; there is a Unionist good, a Nationalist good, a Republican
good, even an Anglo-Irish good, but they seldom meet, except perhaps at
Dublin's Lansdowne Road rugby ground where both sides of the troubled border
support the lads in green.
Otherwise it is noisy shouting across the community divide, at least in the
North, and tragically it is very often much more deadly.
Yet both parts of Ireland face common economic problems, each traditionally
over-dependent on Britain, although gradually less so for the Republic over
recent years. Dublin's campaign to attract multinationals to locate
manufacturing operations in the South has had impressive success, aided by
generous grants and attractive fiscal concessions. But there have been
costs. Repatriation of profits by foreign investors is estimated to exceed
10 per cent of GDP, and when taxation holidays run out some multinationals
look for even cheaper manufacturing bases elsewhere. All the while there has
been inadequate development and strengthening of indigenous industry. The
universities continue to attract more students, the emigrant ships and
aircraft more graduates.
The historically richer north of Ireland has done little better in recent
times; on some criteria even worse. There too incentives were offered to
foreign multinationals, but bombs and bullets mean more than cash in
corporate decision-making, and the North's economy there would surely
collapse were it not for the huge subsidies the province receives from
Britain.
Northern Ireland's dependence on British subsidies and the earlier abortive
De Valera drive in the South for economic self-sufficiency through
protectionism - which sparked off the so-called Economic War with Britain -
are both lessons in internal economic failure. Ireland's membership of the
European Economic Community (EC) has helped the country open up new markets
and reduce its dependence on the UK, but as the recent crisis in the ERM
amply demonstrated, the trade patterns and currencies of the two countries
are still closely related.
In the North the economic and political crisis often seems terminal; in the
South things appear better. In both parts of the country EC funds have
helped somewhat, both directly through the Common Agricultural Policy, and
through infrastructural projects assisted by the Regional Development Fund.
But Ireland North and South remains a fragile economy on the periphery of
Europe, high in unemployment and over-dependent on external forces.
Could the sum of the parts improve the whole? Munck - assisted by a
colleague, Douglas Hamilton - address this question in a final chapter. The
canvas is drawn widely to include five scenarios: continuation of the status
quo; some form of devolved government in Northern Ireland - or, at the
extreme, complete independence and separation; positions around the concept
of economic harmonisation (much closer North-South economic links in a
European context); the reunification of Ireland within a capitalist
framework; and, finally, reunification within a radical democratic
framework.
A preferred choice does not shine through: Munck is open-minded, concerned
above all to set out the basic facts about how the economies of the two
parts of Ireland have developed since the partition.
But there is just a hint. He quotes from a 1933 lecture given in Dublin by
John Maynard Keynes (De Valera had just come to government and was offering
his philosophy of economic self-sufficiency): 'Let goods be homespun
wherever it is reasonably and conveniently possible, and above all, let
finance be primarily national.' Munck thinks these Keynesian principles
retain their relevance for Ireland.

THEIRS WAS THE KINGDOM: LILA AND DeWITT WALLACEAND THE STORY OF THE READER'S
DIGEST by John Heidenry Norton Dollars 29.95 701 pages
IN 1921 a young man armed with sheafs of yellow notepaper took to spending
long hours in the periodicals room of the New York Public Library, sitting
alongside local down-and-outs sheltering from the cold. Many of the library
staff dismissed him as just another eccentric.
Had they but known it, they were witnessing the birth labours of the world's
most successful magazine, Reader's Digest, the foremost literary exponent of
conservative, middle-brow, middle American values and one of the country's
leading cultural exports.
The man in the periodicals room was DeWitt ('Wally') Wallace, founder of the
Digest, who was trawling through the library's magazine racks for articles
he could summarise in his new publication or pithy quotations he could
recycle under the title 'remarkable remarks.'
Wally, the son of a mid-western academic, was in the grip of one of the best
publishing ideas of the century, which had come to him one summer night on a
sheep farm in the vastness of rural Montana, where he was working
temporarily as a hired hand.
He believed a market might exist among ordinary, hard-working American
families, with little spare time and less money, for a magazine with no
advertisements and no illustrations which condensed the most useful
non-fiction articles published by other journals.
Numerous publishers whom he approached rejected the idea. But Wally, stirred
out of the resulting bouts of depression by his new wife Lila, raised
sufficient funds from his family to start it himself, as a mail order
venture. It was an instant success.
From its first issue, says John Heidenry, Reader's Digest became a secular
Bible of a 'deeply religious and immensely disaffected and fearful majority
 -three-fourths of whom still lived on farms. Even when its circulation
numbered only in the thousands, the RD was a mass magazine in sensibility,
taking the side of the vast conservative majority on almost every issue.'
Heidenry, a freelance author, has produced a gripping, wry and gracefully
written narrative history of the Wallaces and their publishing empire.
He makes clear that Wally's genius was twofold. First, he possessed an
extraordinary common touch - a feeling for just exactly what the general
reading public wanted.
Second, he was a master of the art of mail order solicitation. In the early
days, he used to read the YWCA house magazine for news of job transfers, on
the principle that a young woman sent to a strange town would welcome 'any
letter, even a promotion piece.' The Digest became proprietor of the world's
largest mailing list.
Wally's keen marketing sense was evident from the Digest's very first issue.
Assuming, correctly, that the magazine would be primarily bought by women,
he named his wife and her cousin as co-editors, even though neither ever had
any real involvement in the editorial side of the publication.
In later life, Wally rankled at the fact that his wife was given joint
credit for his creation. Yet Lila was throughout her life a powerful
presence behind the scenes. That was brought home in traumatic fashion on
Christmas Eve, 1965, when Wally used a staff party to summarily oust his
long-time general manager, Al Cole, and demote Cole's protege Fred Thompson,
who happened to be Wally's nephew-in-law.
Thompson had been widely regarded as the heir to the Wallaces' business, on
the strength of his business ability rather than nepotism.
Heidenry says the 'Christmas Eve' massacre was the work of Lila, who, having
endured her husband's infidelities for years, drew the line at his recent
affair with her tall, blue-eyed niece, Thompson's wife Judy.
'Lila, like Salome, demanded the head of Fred Thompson on a platter. Wally
finally had to render to his wife the most valuable thing he possessed - the
power to determine the future of the company.'
Sex, in one form or another, had always played a significant role in the
life of the Digest. Heidenry points out that in its early days the
publication was to 'publish more and better sex information, and take a more
progressive attitude towards sex in general, than any other commercial
publication in the English language.' It was also to publish more off-colour
jokes than any other respectable magazine in history.
Yet this liberalism was combined in the editorial pages with the reactionary
political views, including an ugly racist chord the Digest was to sound for
decades.
A further paradox was that this most wholesome of magazines had it origins
in literary piracy. In the Digest's early years, Wally lifted articles
without permission or payment of fees from other magazines - and made sure
that all of his subscribers lived far from the publishing centres of the
East coast, where his theft might be discovered.
It was the start of the company's culture of secrecy, which persisted until
very recently. In the 1930s, when the Great Depression took a toll on
magazines, and thus the source of Digest fodder, the magazine resorted to
another great deception: it commissioned and paid for articles which it
planted in other magazines, purely so it could itself run condensed
versions.
Heidenry is at his best when describing these early decades, and the group's
phenomenally successful move into fiction publishing after World War Two.
The second half of the book, which deals with the Digest's development from
a huge 'mom and pop' business into a global bureaucracy, is equally
authoritative, but the story is less compelling and burdened with too much
detail.
This is a very good book, but one which could perhaps have learnt something
from the Digest's art of condensation.

NATIONAL INNOVATION SYSTEMS, A COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS by Richard R Nelson
(editor) Oxford University Press Pounds 25.00 541 pages
THERE IS a widespread belief in Europe that high-technology industries such
as electronics and aerospace have a special economic importance and deserve
to be supported by governments. Some influential members of the Clinton
administration hold the same view, arguing that the US should be more
aggressive in defending what are sometimes called strategic sectors or
critical technologies against state-subsidised competition from abroad.
Yet as Richard Nelson observes in his conclusion to this admirable study of
national innovation systems: 'There does not seem to be strong empirical
support for the proposition that national economies are broadly advantaged
if their firms are especially strong in high tech and disadvantaged if they
are not'.
The US economy, Nelson Points out, has been lagging badly for nearly 20
years in spite of continuing dominance in some high-tech industries; France,
he suggests, has been economically successful 'more despite her efforts to
nurture and subsidise her high-technology industries than because of them'.
Even if the existence of successful, nationally-owned high-tech companies is
thought to be a desirable objective, the record of government policies in
this field is at best uneven. In his chapter on Germany Otto Keck notes that
in the post-war period the federal government 'was hesitant in assuming
responsibilities for science and technology, and where it did, as in nuclear
power, aerospace and electronic data processing, its programmes for
supporting industrial technology were ineffective'.
Francois Chesnais writes that a large part of French high-tech industry has
been shaped by military demand; competitiveness in commercial markets has
not been helped by 'the highly customised, non-generic features of military
technology and their very low degree of transferability to civilian uses'.
He also argues that the overwhelming bias in favour of defence-related
technologies has been to the detriment both of the chemical, biological and
life-science sectors and of industries such as machine tools which tend to
be dominated by small companies.
US experience shows that, in certain circumstances, especially when a
technology is at an early stage of development, defence-related procurement
can be a stimulus to commercial application. This was the case in
semiconductors in the 1950s and 1960s, when the existence of a large
military demand in the US lowered the marketing-based barriers to entry.
Small firms such as Texas Instruments could direct their development effort
to the needs of a single large customer and use that business as the basis
for building a broader range of customers and applications.
The American contributors to this volume, David Mowery and Nathan Rosenberg,
suggest that commercial spillovers from defence research and procurement
fluctuate over time within a specific technology; the trend in recent years
has been for the needs of the two markets to diverge and thus for spillovers
to diminish in importance.
So what should governments do? Two crucial determinants of a nation's
innovative capacity are the education and training system and the
macro-economic environment. It was institutional innovation, particularly
the close links between research-oriented companies and the science
departments of universities, which gave Germany the lead in dyestuffs and
pharmaceuticals at the end of the 19th century; some 3,000 chemists were
employed in German industry in 1897, far ahead of Britain and the US. In
more recent times Korea and Taiwan are examples of education-led growth.
Their ability to move quickly from simple to complex products was made
possible by the availability of a young, highly-educated workforce.
As for the economic environment, fiscal, monetary and trade policies need to
be designed in a way which encourages firms to compete in world markets,
rather than 'hunkering down' in protected national markets. With the partial
exception of the US, exposure to international competition has been a
characteristic of most successful innovating nations.
In addition, governments have an important role in supporting basis
research. Problems arise when they go 'downstream' and back specific
industries and companies. In an interesting chapter on Japan, Hiroyuki
Odagiri and Akira Goto concede the importance in the 1950s and 1960s of
MITI's control over the importation of technology and the restriction on
inward investment. These policies probably contributed to Japan's catch-up
with more advanced countries, but since the early 1970s the involvement of
MITI has been much less and government-business relationships have been
weakening.
The authors stress internal competition as one of the keys to the country's
technical progress. Entry into growing industries has been fast and
frequent, inducing in the companies 'a strong sense of crisis and a
motivation to be innovative'.
Picking winners in the hope of establishing world leadership in an emerging
technology is risky and potentially expensive. As Nelson argues, active
government policies are often more effective when they are aimed at
encouraging industry to take up new technologies than when oriented towards
subsidising big breakthroughs.
In Germany, for example, after their lack of success in targeting specific
sectors, the authorities have recently been focusing on the diffusion of
technology and on strengthening cooperation among firms or between companies
and public research organisations; the aim is to alert companies to
technological frontiers and to create links between suppliers and users of
specialised inputs. British policy has been moving in a similar direction.
The 15 countries covered in this book include large and small industrial
states (Sweden, Denmark, Canada, Australia and Israel, as well as the four
bigger European countries, the US and Japan), and successful and less
successful developing countries (Brazil and Argentina as well as Korea and
Taiwan). As a collection of papers from different authors, the book is
unusually coherent in its scope and analysis. It provides a wealth of
information not just about technology policies, but about the institutional
and cultural factors which influence each country's industrial performance.
There is no single route to success. Thus Korea and Taiwan are similar in
their commitment to education, but in other respects have followed quite
different policies. Korea has encouraged the creation of large conglomerates
and resisted inward investment; Taiwan has been less favourable to large
firms and has admitted foreign companies selectively.
In some cases, as in relations between Japan and the US, differences in
innovation systems have become a source of trade friction. But Nelson is
surely right to describe as somewhat hysterical the current concern about
allegedly unfair competition in high-tech industries. Much of the concern is
based on misunderstandings about how governments intervene and about the
effects of intervention on competitiveness. This book is an important
contribution towards more balanced discussion of high-tech issues and more
rational government policies.

ACCOUNTANCY'S FAULTY SUMS by Keron Bhattacharya Macmillan, Pounds 25
BEYOND THE BOTTOM LINE by Alan Warner Gower Pounds 19.50
Phil turned to Christine as she started explaining how to value the company.
But he found it hard to concentrate on the numbers as he remembered the time
they spent together in London . . .
Well, even though you and I might consider the answer obvious, your
high-fallutin' accountant has another way of dealing with the figures which
he manages to justify, oh yes.
IF THERE IS one trap that two new accountancy textbooks manage to avoid, it
is a conventional or boring approach to their subject.
Accountancy's Faulty Sums, by Keron Bhattacharya, a business consultant, is
a guide to the basics of external financial reporting and internal
management accounting. He touches on many interesting and topical issues,
including the favourite of the year, the creative accounting devices used to
flatter profits or conceal liabilities. He also provides an introduction
into theories such as Activity Based Costing.
Probably the greatest strength of the book lies in its examples. Some draw
on well-known corporate events to illustrate a point, such as the problems
at Cray Electronics and Atlantic Computers.
Others come from Bhattacharya's own experiences. He talks about the
accountant at one company he was helping to sell who valued stock based on
budgeted expenditures devised a year previously at a time of high inflation,
substantially swelling losses.
He mentions another company he was closing as an illustration of poor cash
control. He at first planned to pay all creditors, but then decided to write
and ask them if they had any claims. About 90 per cent wrote back to say
they did not, so he kept it.
The style of writing and the degree of detailed analysis is a rather more
awkward point. The chatty approach may appeal to some, but others will
consider it a little too irritatingly long-winded, unstructured and full of
waffle.
He refers to Pacioli, the man credited with inventing double-entry
bookkeeping, as 'that old codger from Venice 500 years ago'. A little more
research and re-writing would have been worth the investment.
Beyond the Bottom Line is written rather more racily. Alan Warner, a
management training consultant, uses the highly original approach of a
romantic business novel to teach the rudiments of management finance.
Phil Moorley works for Chapman Foods in New York, becoming president shortly
after a takeover bid from Universal, his previous employer. Christine
Goodhart is the management consultant he hires to help him understand the
accounting issues.
But Phil is also middle-aged and insecure. Christine is blonde and
beautiful. They had something of a fling in Britain in the past, or so we
gather in numerous references to Warner's previous book, The Bottom Line,
published in 1988.
Will Phil remain loyal to his wife, or once more succumb to Christine's
charms? Will he ever get to grips with the jargon of the takeover and defend
Chapman against Universal?
All we can hope is that Warner's understanding of management accounting is
somewhat better than his rather crude characterisations. However, Beyond the
Bottom Line is certainly a readable way to wade through financial issues
pegged to real examples in a practical way.

THE LAST EMPIRE by Stefan Kanfer Farrar Straus Giroux Dollars 25, 409 pages
I WONDER whether this book is really necessary. It purports, in the words of
its sub-title, to tell the tale of 'De Beers, Diamonds and the World'. In
effect it is a re-treading of the familiar story of the mining miracle of
South Africa, from the discovery of diamonds in 1869 through to the sage old
age of Harry Oppenheimer.
Inevitably, The Last Empire falls into two halves: first, the rumbustious
early days of the Randlords, and second, the post-First War years,
dominated, as still today, by the Oppenheimer family. The snag is that there
is no shortage of perfectly good general books on the entire period:
Geoffrey Wheatcroft's elegant The Randlords, for example, has just been
re-issued in Britain in paperback (Weidenfeld, Pounds 9.99); there are a
dozen biographies of Cecil Rhodes and plenty of books about the diamond
industry; and the Oppenheimers - Ernest, Harry and now Nicky - have not been
allowed to blush unseen.
Still, you cannot have too much of a good thing, and the story has always
been one of the best. Mr Kanfer is a veteran of Time magazine and he tells
it with an eye to the newcomer. The tone of voice tends to the racey,
sometimes to Hollywood ('the sunstruck country lay sleeping in the Middle
Ages') - apparently he used to be a showbiz writer - and occasionally he can
be acute ('In the looking-glass politics of South Africa, a conservative
Christian multimillionaire (Harry Oppenheimer) born in Johannesburg was
portrayed as a conniving English Jew. And his party, which for half a
century had kept black labour available, cheap and docile, was maligned as a
group of irresponsible radicals . . . '). All the same, it's a bit worrying
that after four years' research he insists on inserting a non-existent
hyphen into Anglo American and that he still cannot spell Afrikaner (or
Mahdi).
We are given all the usual stories about the pioneer generation: Barney
Barnato, Louis Cohen, J B Robinson, Alfred Beit, Cecil Rhodes, et al. (There
was a nice first exchange between the latter pair. Said Beit: 'I intend to
control the whole diamond output before I am much older.' 'That's funny,'
replied Rhodes, 'I have made up my mind to do the same. We had better join
hands.' Which they did.)
Ernest Oppenheimer rightly dominates the story of the second generation. He
arrived in Kimberley, a German Jew, at the end of the Boer War in 1902 just
as the vicious anti-semitic caricature of 'Hoggenheimer' - imported from a
London musical called 'The Girl from Kay's' - was introduced to South
Africa. 'Hoggenheimer' was to feature in South Africa's politics for the
rest of the century: the similarity of the names was accidental, unfortunate
and irresistible to the Afrikaners.
By 1914 Ernest had established himself, only to be driven out of Kimberley,
and out of the country, by anti-German hysteria. He returned, went for gold,
and the rest is the story of Anglo American. Thirty years later Prime
Minister D F Malan abused Ernest's son Harry for exercising 'a greater
influence than any man in South Africa has ever had'.
If Mr Kanfer has a particular theme it is the underlying role of Jews - and,
by extension, of anti-semitism - in the development of South Africa's
diamonds and precious metals. For many centuries, of course, there had been
a Jewish affinity for, and expertise in, diamonds. Mediaeval jewellers'
guilds admitted Hebrews, diamonds were traditionally the most effective way
to carry and protect wealth in dangerous times, and from the earliest days
in Kimberley there was a visible Jewish presence.
But, as Mr Kanfer points out, it is far too easy for anti-semites to assume
that you can spot a Jew by his name. Of the Randlords, for example, Hermann
Eckstein was son of a Lutheran pastor, Julius Wernher was a German
Protestant, Alfred Beit was Christian. He might have added that Harry
Oppenheimer, though Jewish by birth, is today a practising Anglican and that
his father was baptised after losing his wife, his son, his nephew and his
brother-in-law in an appalling series of tragedies. (The ironic gloss to the
long-standing anti-semitism of the South African Right is that the National
Party government for years enjoyed a close, and semi-secret, relationship
with Israel).
This book ends in 1992 with De Beers cutting its dividend, but warnings of
'crisis ahead' are never developed in a detail which would have anything to
say to the more professional reader. Nor is anything insightful offered us
about Anglo's future course. The Empire is troubled, we are assured. Well,
if you consider what is going on in South Africa at present, you would
hardly expect them to be enjoying, in Cecil Rhodes' wonderful phrase, 'three
days at the seaside'.

FT  28 SEP 93 / The FT Review of Business Books (1): Towards a treaty of

world's environmental dilemmas

THE GNAT IS OLDER THAN MAN: GLOBAL ENVIRONMENT AND THE HUMAN AGENDA by
Christopher D Stone Princeton University Press Pounds 14.99 234 pages
ENVIRONMENTAL commentary lurches unsteadily between unrelieved doomsdaying
and wide-eyed evangelism.
Christopher Stone draws you into a much more subtle and invigorating world,
with a layer-cake of problems to which answers - if there be any - are
rarely straightforward. Since that is how we humans fashion our agendas as
we go about our daily businesses, there is a lot to be said for it.
'Some cultures regard the earth and life upon it as relatively insignificant
in comparison with eternal Paradise; others regard all of Nature (of which
homo sapiens are just another ingredient) as sacred; still others are
relatively homocentric. Some nations value whales in the oceans; others, on
their plates.'
So how should we today provide for tomorrow? 'Many of today's controversial
actions, such as the storage of nuclear wastes and the elimination of
wilderness areas, involve a shifting of risks on to the unborn. We cannot be
sure what the remote effects of our actions will be, particularly in the
light of the technology that will be available to our distant progeny. Will
they really care that the oceans are whaleless?'
For Stone, the best way to negotiate these thickets of criss-crossing
interests is to look for common ground in what are still common areas - in
the seas and in the upper atmosphere, where claims of national sovereignty
fray and fade.
Even here, in these Global Commons, the problems are not easily gripped.
'The scale of waste that travels the state-to-commons pathway is gargantuan.
Together, the nations of the world pump over 7 billion tons of carbon into
the atmosphere annually, together with 255 million tons of nitrous oxides
and sulphur dioxide, and 770,000 tons of CFCs. Similarly, 85 to 90 per cent
of ocean pollution originates on land - sewage sludge, industrial wastes,
and, every year, a swelling flotilla of non-biodegradable trash - plastic
bottles, soft-drink containers and the like.'
Moreover, the seas are proving more resistant to remedial action than the
upper atmosphere. As Stone notes ruefully: 'The real stumbling block is
simply practical economics. The fact that so much waste is involved - and
growing - and so many hardpressed industries and nations are implicated,
means that until public protest reaches a shriller pitch, little will
change.'
Stone gives economic prescriptions their due, but stresses that there are no
easy 'polluter pays' shortcuts. Consider the Dutch tulip. Chloride salts,
largely from German up-river fertiliser production, come downstream at 1,200
tons an hour, to the evident ill-health of the tulip. But, hold on. 'A
German might ask, do the Dutch have more right to raise tulips than the
Germans have to raise grain? Are the Dutch to be awarded the upper hand
morally simply because they are saddled with the lower bank geographically?'
Agreed, the way the river flows, the potash happens to be in the ordinary
sense 'the cause' of the trouble.
On the other hand, if the downstream Dutch would only grow some crop less
sensitive to salt than tulips, the harm would be less. Why isn't the Dutch
decision to grow tulips equally 'the cause'? Or should it turn on
priorities: Was Germany salting the river before Holland was planting bulbs?
Stone is Crocker Professor of Law at the University of Southern California.
His earlier book, Should Trees Have Standing? Towards Legal Rights For
Natural Objects, is rightly regarded as an environmental classic. Here he
points to the inevitability of negotiation as the only way forward, and then
more negotiation.
He asserts that a treaty mechanism, where attainable, is preferable to the
law-suit. The lawyers run up big bills, and can take forever and a day;
treaties are less threatening and can sometimes put you ahead of the game,
even if only on a partial basis.
'A treaty is clearly the easier to conclude, the fewer the number of nations
whose cooperation is required to make it effective. Several early
conventions regarding outer space, the moon, and celestial bodies were
hammered out successfully because negotiations began when their effects were
still distant in space and time, before potential vetoing constituencies had
an opportunity to form.'
Stone's special attention to the oceans leads him to suggest a system of
'Guardians' drawn from existing international agencies or relevant NGOs, who
would be threaded through the legal framework to speak up for particular
parts of the common environment when threatened.
He argues cogently for a Global Commons Trust Fund, some dedicated monies to
underwrite internationally significant efforts. 'No single nation can afford
to keep on full-time alert a staff trained and equipped to contain oil
spills with oil-eating bacteria, etc. No single nation anticipates enough
incidents to warrant the expense. But a force with global responsibilities,
financed out of the fund, might well be justified.'
Throughout, Stone emphasises that sound achievement is best built on modest
ambitions. But as the book unfolds he is inevitably drawn back to the wider
picture, and to the narrowness of current legal theory - ie not much since
John Rawls's Theory of Justice, and indeed not much in that. 'The entire
subject of international justice, which I believe will be the great
philosophical issue of the 1990s, Rawls touched upon in 1971 only indirectly
in less than three pages - too obscurely to raise to his indexer's
attention.' A pointer here, perhaps, to Stone's next book.
Stone is writing here for laymen - among whom most businessmen should
properly be counted - and legislators as well as lawyers. Worrying away at
the intricacies of our environmental predicament, he sharpens interest in a
topic that is always prone to compassion fatigue. In Stone's hands, worrying
about the planet, or reading about worrying about it, is much more fun than
you had perhaps anticipated. For that reason, as well as the prudent
self-interest of any alert citizen-cum-businessman, the Gnat deserves a long
life.
The title? From the Talmud, in dedicatory tribute to the author's father, IF
Stone, and to 'the literary tradition from which he came.' Here's how the
passage ends: 'Man's late appearance on earth is to convey an admonition of
humility. Let him beware of being proud, lest he invite the retort than the
gnat is older than he.'

FT  28 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: TSB advances
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO and CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Banking group TSB moved ahead 6 to 217p, as volume rose to 6.7m, after two
brokers upgraded profits expectations, a move which boosted sentiment in the
sector as a whole.
Lehman Brothers, the US investment bank, and SG Warburg raised forecasts
following a meeting with the board last Friday. Lehman increased its
forecasts by Pounds 30m to Pounds 260m for this year and by Pounds 15m to
Pounds 440m for the following year; while Warburg is now predicting that TSB
will make Pounds 280m this year, against its previous projection of around
Pounds 245m.
Speculation that TSB had at last found a buyer for Hill Samuel, its merchant
banking arm, was again heard. The positive mood on TSB, together with the
strong market trend, helped other stocks in the sector. Barclays hardened 2
to 506p, while Lloyds appreciated 9 to 566p. Royal Bank of Scotland gained 6
at 313p.
A squeeze in Forte sent the shares smartly forward to close 11 ahead at
240p. Leisure specialists said there was also a relief factor following
weekend press reports that the group is unlikely to make a long-rumoured
rights issue with its results tomorrow. Turnover was 1.9m.
Presentations to analysts by Hazlewood Foods prompted a raft of slim
downgrades, the shares reacting badly and finishing 8 off at 175p. BZW cut
its profits forecast to March 1994 to Pounds 57.5m, with Smith New Court
trimming to Pounds 59m. Analysts attributed the downgrades to general dull
trading.
Rumours of a more positive attitude towards Northern Foods after last week's
downgrades left the shares 7 better at 257p.
Food retailers rallied after last week's mauling which followed Tesco's
results, some in the market believing the falls to be overdone. Tesco firmed
2 to 204p and J. Sainsbury 6 to 434p.
Confirmation that Severn Trent is to lose its chairman in a board shake-up
left the stock 7 lighter at 546p in a weak waters sector.
A big seller of Boots set the stock back 4 to 479p. SG Warburg was said to
be positive on Kingfisher, up 6 at 672p.
Talk of continuing good sales at Marks and Spencer saw the shares add 3 at
379p.
Hammerson was the odd stock out in a strong property sector as the shares
reacted to dull results, the 'A' slipping 5 to 353p. Property specialists
said that although the new management had started well, its hands were tied
in a continuing difficult market. Land Securities climbed 6 to 678p and
Great Portland Estates 7 to 211p.
Engineering group Siebe gained 6 at 525p after both Kleinwort Benson and
NatWest Securities came out with positive comments on the group. While
saying it remained 'neutral' on the stock, NatWest said Siebe was one of the
stocks that 'would do well in any year-end rally'.
Positive weekend press comment, together with talk that a recent stock
overhang had been cleared, saw shipbuilding and engineering group VSEL move
up 9 to 857p.
Brokers remained positive about British Steel, which ended 4 higher at 123
1/2 p on trade of 8.6m.
In motors, GKN closed a penny down at 479p, with Kleinwort Benson said to
have reduced current year profits expectations.
Channel tunnel operator Eurotunnel was back in favour with investors ahead
of interim results due within a fortnight. The stock jumped 18 to 508p.
Favourable sentiment in Mersey Docks following its recent acquisition of
Medway Port continued to lift the shares, which added 9 at 388p.
Bargain hunters were seen for P&amp;O shares, which have been underperforming
since the group's recent disappointing figures. They put on 14 at 575p.
Dealers said container rental group Tiphook remained friendless in an
otherwise strong market, losing 7 at 257p.
Shares in Prudential Corporation were boosted by a recommendation from SG
Warburg and finished 7 ahead at 346p after trade of 1.8m.
Steel Burrill Jones continued to languish after its recent poor set of
figures, the shares receding a further 15 to 123p.
A profits warning and the passing of the dividend from Andrew Sykes saw the
shares tumble 30 to 75p.
Reuters finished 6 stronger at 1538p, with sentiment boosted by news that
the London International Financial Futures Exchange is to resume talks on
joining Globex, the round the clock futures trad-ing system co-developed by
Reuters.
Dealers expect the shares to continue moving forward today following a
presentation of the Dealing 2,000 system at Henderson Crosthwaite to
institutional clients.

Reports that Opec ministers meeting in Geneva had agreed to set the ceiling
on their total output for the fourth quarter at 24.5m barrels per day
cheered the market and drove several oil stocks sharply forward.
The positive progress of the Opec talks also brought a slight improvement in
the oil price, which helped to underpin the day's advance in oil shares, as
did a slight shortage of stock earlier in the session.
The day's main advances included British Petroleum, which rose 11 to 313p
with just over 6m shares traded, Enterprise Oil, 12 up at 444p, and Shell
Transport, 9 stronger at 660p in trade of 1.8m.
However, talks about the distribution of quotas within the ceiling were
still in progress by yesterday's market close and one analyst remained
cautious and said: 'Today's rise may be premature given that nothing has
been decided about the quotas.'

Troubled Brent Walker, reporting increased losses and warning of continued
caution over current trading, was said to have prompted a large seller of
Allied-Lyons on nervousness regarding the pub leasing arrangement between
the two companies.
Allied has leased Brent Walker more than 730 pubs as part of the
government's Beer Orders, and the poor Walker figures combined with warnings
from the group over its hefty interest charges led some to speculate that
Walker may wish to terminate the arrangement. Allied fell 12 but rallied to
close just 3 off at 560p. Turnover was an average 2.5m. Walker edged up to
7p.
Speculation that Allied is about to sell its Grant of St James spirits
business to Matthew Clark intensified after the latter was suspended at
470p. However, Clark would have to raise close to its market capitalisation
of around Pounds 60m to secure the business. Analysts said the move would be
seen favourably for Allied.

FT  28 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: Grandmet moves welcomed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO and CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER THE shock of last week's board changes, Grand Metropolitan surprised
the market again yesterday by announcing a large restructuring charge.
However, the shares moved forward on the news, incorporated in a relatively
positive trading statement, as investors and analysts expressed relief that
Friday's market speculation of a profits warning did not materialise. The
shares finished 10 ahead at 403p in good turnover of 10m.
Grandmet said the Pounds 175m provision would be spread across all its
businesses, although its Green Giant food division and Pearle optician
concern will take large chunks. Brewery analysts were largely positive on
the moves, the two US businesses being weak spots in profitability for some
time.
There was some speculation that Grandmet will use the Pounds 60m
rationalisation costs at Pearle to ready the division for sale. Analysts
said that, once profitable and restruc-tured, Pearle could fetch up to
Dollars 400m.
There was also talk that Grandmet would put money into its Chef and Brewer
restaurant business ahead of its long-rumoured sale. Whitbread, whose 'A'
shares advanced 5 to 536p, remains the market favourite to buy the bulk of
the 1,500-strong chain.
Mr Kevin Feeny at Henderson Crosthwaite said: 'Today's statement has allayed
the market's worst fears. Trading in particular has been shown to be
surprisingly resilient, particularly at IDV.'
He added that the shares could show some strength from their current level
once the market had digested the details of yesterday's statement.

FT  28 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: Footsie climbs away from 3,000
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LONDON joined in the strong rebound in European stock markets yesterday,
which welcomed the calmer news from Russia, and the Footsie ended
convincingly above 3,000 for the first time in a fortnight. Calls for
interest rate cuts from Sir Leon Brittan, chief EC trade negotiator, found a
ready response in the stock market, and a strong opening to the new Wall
Street session gave further encouragement.
Equities were easier at first and the Footsie 3,000 mark came in for another
testing in early trade. But once the December futures contract on the
Footsie opened at a strong premium, the direction of the stock market was
never in doubt. The pace of the advance was dictated throughout by the
December contract but its premium of 36 against the underlying equity market
ensured a sound stock market. Dealers in both equities and futures agreed
that it was the strength of the German stock market which lay behind
London's rise.
At the close, the FT-SE 100 Index was 21.1 up at 3,026.3, just under the
best of the day. Trading volume was slow at first but picked up as investors
gained confidence. The day's Seaq total of 540.9m shares compared with
527.3m on Friday, when retail business worth Pounds 1.46bn maintained the
improvement in turnover volumes achieved this year.
Arbitraging between the December future and the underlying stocks returned
the focus to the blue chip issues. Consequently, the FT-SE Mid 250 Index, up
5.2 at 3,437.1, saw less activity than in recent sessions.
Firmness in government bonds ahead of tomorrow's auction of Pounds 3.25bn
securities and also in sterling fuelled hopes of a cut in domestic base
rates, perhaps around the time of the annual conference of the governing
Conservative party.
Optimistic views on the outlook for corporate profits from two leading UK
securities houses also helped sentiment. Shares in Grand Metropolitan, the
brewery and hotels group, closed higher despite the market's slightly
cautious reception of its latest trading statement.
The Footsie Index benefited from strong gains in leading oil shares as the
meeting of Opec ministers in Geneva got under way. But the pharmaceuticals
sector lagged behind both London and New York as the less positive trend in
the US dollar helped unsettle share prices.
The renewed hopes that base rate cuts might not be too far away brought
firmness in bank shares, where lower interest rates would ease the burden of
bad debts. Similar factors helped the consumer retail sector, which will be
featured this week by boardroom statements from two leading names. Some
building and construction stocks also responded to base rate optimism.
Traders noted that trading volume in the futures market, where the big
securities firms often re-position themselves before buying the underlying
stocks, had been high yesterday. If the institutions have turned more
optimistic towards UK equities, then traders would expect to see this
reflected in higher Seaq trading figures later this week.
Equity strategists, favourably impressed by the stock market's resilience in
the face of the potentially disturbing developments in Russia, now hope for
an improvement in the trend of corporate results from British companies.

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARPLY improved trading volume in stock index futures restored the December
contract to a good premium and provided the driving force behind the stock
market yesterday, writes Terry Byland.
London took its cue from the recovery in the German stock market, although
UK equities were slow to move until the futures market opened.
The strength of the December Footsie contract, which stood at a 36-point
premium, brought arbitraging between futures and equities, chiefly by one
large UK securities house and a leading Japanese firm. They were able to
sell the future at its peak and buy the underlying stocks, taking advantage
of a US house which found itself short of the future and was obliged to buy.
December closed at 3,066, a 34-point premium against cash and 12 to fair
value. Volume increased to 10,864 contracts, compared with under 8,000 in
the previous session. However, the future traded 15,000 contracts at the
beginning of last week.
With dealers concentrating on the Footsie future contract, traded options
had a calmer session, with 23,835 contracts transacted against 36,996 on
Friday.
Even the FT-SE 100 option was significantly less active than on Friday,
recording 9,375 lots compared with 14,891. British Steel topped the active
stocks list for options with a figure of 3,812, followed by J. Sainsbury at
1,397.

FT  28 SEP 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow helped by resurgent bond
prices
</HEADLINE>

Wall Street
PROGRAM trading and a surge in bond prices, which pushed long-term yields
back below 6 per cent, provided a strong lift to US stock markets yesterday,
writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 24.59 higher at 3,567.70.
The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 climbed 4.17 to 461.80, nearing
its closing all-time peak of 463.56 of August 31, while the American SE
composite gained 1.91 at 456.44. The Nasdaq composite, which last week
climbed to historic highs in spite of weakness in the wider market,
maintained its surge and ended 5.30 stronger at a record 759.95. New York SE
volume came to 245m shares.
The week got off to a positive start, thanks primarily to the resurgent bond
market. Last week's news that the Federal Reserve's policy-making Open
Market Committee had shifted the bias of its monetary policy from an
inclination to tightening back to a neutral stance was the fuel propelling
the bond market yesterday. By late afternoon the 30-year bond was up more
than one point, and the yield was back down to 6 per cent for the first time
in several weeks.
The bond rally heartened equity investors who, after seven days of flat or
lower share prices, were in the mood to buy stocks again. Computerised buy
programs kicked in almost from the start, and by the end of the first 30
minutes of trading the Dow was up 22 points. Investors were also encouraged
by overnight gains on European equity markets, although the day's domestic
news - a 1.3 per cent decline in August existing home sales - had a
dampening effect upon sentiment.
Paramount Communications rose Dollars 2 to Dollars 77 5/8 in volume of 2.4m
shares on reports that the entertainment group's management, which two weeks
ago accepted a Dollars 67.50 a share takeover bid from Viacom, is prepared
to consider the rival Dollars 84.25 a share offer from the television
shopping network QVC. Amid the uncertainty, Viacom advanced Dollars 1 5/8 to
Dollars 62 1/2 on the American SE, and QVC, listed on the Nasdaq market,
fell Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 59 5/8 , a possible indication that investors
believe that QVC will win the Paramount takeover battle.
Falling interest rates were good for bank shares. JP Morgan, a Dow
constituent, climbed Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 77 1/8 , Citicorp added
Dollars  3/4 at Dollars 37, Chemical put on Dollars  5/8 at Dollars 44 7/8 ,
Chase Manhattan rose Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 37 1/4 and Banc One firmed
Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 41 7/8 . The exception was BankAmerica, which
declined Dollars 1 to Dollars 45 3/4 .
Drug issues, still troubled by uncertainty surrounding President Clinton's
health care reform plan, which was unveiled last week, mostly bucked the
market trend. Pfizer eased Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 60 7/8 , Merck shed
Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 31 1/4 , Bristol-Myers Squibb slipped Dollars  3/8
to Dollars 57 1/4 and Warner-Lambert weakened Dollars  3/4 to 67 3/4 .
Canada
TORONTO stocks closed firmer for choice after moderate trading which was
boosted by a large block trade in Czar Resources shares.
The TSE 300 index gained just 1.5 at 3,983.8 and rising issues outnumbered
declines by 397 to 334. Volume amounted to 52.1m shares valued at CDollars
485.5m. The day's turnover included a block trade of 8m Czar Resources
shares.
Ten of the 14 stock groups ended higher, with transportation up 1.06 per
cent. The gold shares sector recorded the day's biggest change, falling 1.95
per cent as the New York spot bullion price receded USDollars 2.70 an ounce.

EQUITIES finished lower after shedding early gains, mainly on
arbitrage-linked trading and selling linked to the expiry of margin
contracts, agencies report from Tokyo.
The 225-share Nikkei average lost 213.42, or 1 per cent, to 20,094.11, after
an intraday high of 20,384.44 and low of 20,000.00 . Volume was estimated at
about 200m shares, compared to 303m on Friday.
Declines outscored advances by 607 to 379, with 176 stocks unchanged. The
Topix index fell 11.00 to 1,620.36, but in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index
put on 1.23 at 1,247.78.
The market opened firmer, led by buying of pharmaceutical and retail
sectors, while strength in the Nikkei futures also helped encourage prices.
Positive news from weekend talks by G7 delegates failed to excite much
interest: the meeting in Washington urged Japan to reform its tax system and
cut income taxes in an effort to revitalise the domestic economy.
Pharmaceuticals rose on expectations that forthcoming biotechnology
conferences could unveil new products. Sankyo moved ahead Y30 to Y2,970 and
Eisai Y60 to Y2,060.
Roundup
THE destination of the 2000 Olympic Games, which caused a flurry in the
region late last week, reverted mostly to the sports pages yesterday.
HONG KONG fell as Sino-British talks on the colony ended with the UK saying
the two sides were still far apart. The Hang Seng index dipped 72.96 to
7,452.09 as turnover shrank again, from HKDollars 3.22bn to HKDollars
2.16bn.
Blue chips took the heaviest blows, with HSBC sliding HKDollars 1 to
HKDollars 79, its Hang Seng Bank unit losing 50 cents to HKDollars 53 and
Cheung Kong shedding 30 cents to HKDollars 26.90. But Henderson Land, which
announced a 64 per cent jump in net profits on Friday, appreciated HKDollars
1.50 to HKDollars 22.70.
BANGKOK traders decided that the market was a technical sell, while
investors were kept on the sidelines by the impending enforcement of
stricter rules on margin requirements.
The SET index retreated 14.68, or 1.5 per cent, to 964.90 in thin turnover
of Bt4.02bn.
New rules on margin requirements, which will become effective on Friday,
will force investors to sell stocks in their portfolios if share prices fall
to certain levels.
AUSTRALIA sobered after Friday's buying spree on the choice of Sydney as
host city for the 2000 Olympics. The All Ordinaries index eased 3.5 to
1,943.0 as turnover slumped from ADollars 794.2m to ADollars 268.1m.
Building and construction groups, the major movers last week, were little
changed, although brokers said there was still selective off-shore buying on
the Sydney Olympics theme.
SEOUL decided that equities would rise after this week's Chusok holiday, and
anticipated the gains with the composite index rising by 14.28, or just over
2 per cent, to 717.83.
A broker said institutions had turned around from being recent net sellers.
SINGAPORE saw late bargain hunting and the Straits Times Industrial index
rose 6.10 to 1,989.35. But volume was mostly in Malaysian shares as it
expanded from 287.8m shares to 324.3m. KUALA LUMPUR was led higher by
second-line stocks. The KLSE composite index gained 5.45 at 851.94.
SHANGHAI's China 'B' shares jumped after more than a month of consolidation.
Instititutional investment buying attributed to both China and US funds
lifted the Standard Chartered Securities Shanghai 'B' Share index by 3
points, or 5 per cent, to 63.46, while the SCS SHENZHEN 'B' Share index
added only 0.48, or 0.8 per cent, at 63.6.

FT  28 SEP 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Milan anticipates good reports
from telecoms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ANTICIPATION of upcoming results in Italy, and relief that the Russian
political situation did not explode over the weekend took the Eurotrack 100
to a rise of more than 1 per cent, writes Our Markets Staff.
MILAN moved solidly forward in the second half of the day, led by strong
demand for telecommunications issues and expressing the view that some of
the recent corporate results had proved to be less painful than expected.
The Comit index rose 6.81 to 593.32 as foreigners returned as buyers at the
lower levels seen after Friday's decline.
Sip, which reports today, added L140 or 4 per cent to L3,577 while Stet (due
tomorrow) was L202 or 5 per cent higher at L4,258.
Fiat, also due with results today, advanced L188 to L5,836; Rinascente, its
retail subsidiary, added L308 to L32,532 and Toro, the insurer, was marked
L1,480 higher to L32,532 amid renewed speculation about Fiat asset sales.
FRANKFURT virtually recovered Friday's losses, the DAX index rising 26.32 to
1,912.18 as some brokers covered short positions. Turnover rose from DM5.2bn
to DM5.9bn.
Above average gains came in Commerzbank, sensitive to Russian bad debt risks
and up DM6.50 to DM310.80; in Daimler and Volkswagen, up by DM19 to DM751,
and DM8.50 to DM367.50; and in Lufthansa, DM6.50 better at DM159.
Mr Christopher Will of Lehman Brothers said that he was not bullish of
Daimler; but that the company's New York listing was imminent, it had the
participation of major brokers, and there had been a flow of positive news
items in addition to the losses reported on the US GAAP accounting basis in
mid-month. He noted that VW, relative to the German market, had fallen by 15
per cent from its peak this year.
Lufthansa rose again on the air pact signed between Germany and the US last
week.
Investment interest in PARIS began to recede slightly as soon as it became
apparent that the authorities were not going to cut the intervention rate as
had been hoped by some traders at the close of Friday's trading. The CAC-40
index finished up 16.01 at 2,108.61, but off the day's high of 2,117.
There was some early speculative buying of interest rate sensitive stocks
such as Eurotunnel, which closed up 80 centimes at FFr43.60 after FFr44.20.
Michelin, too, shed morning gains as the shares ended FFr4.10 higher at
FFr185.60, down from an intraday high of FFr188.50.
Oil sector stocks made ground on the agreement by Opec members to set a
ceiling on production levels: Elf Aquitaine rose FFr5.90 to FFr400.50 and
Total FFr3.30 to FFr303.40.
ZURICH moved swiftly ahead but profit-taking, as the SMI index approached
2,500, left shares below their best levels. The SMI finished 36.5 ahead at
2,482.4 after an intraday high of 2,496.8.
Mr Beat Philipp at Bank Vontobel in Zurich said: 'We are seeing the blue
chip stocks, which had been underperformers, being rediscovered.' Strong
foreign and domestic demand had emerged for pharmaceuticals, food stocks and
the banks as investors took the view that they were relatively cheap by
international standards, he said.
Roche certificiates added SFr60 to SFr5,360 after a day's high of SFr5,470
while registered shares in Ciba-Geigy added SFr10 to SFr688, after peaking
at SFr705.
Among banks, supported by hopes for lower interest rates, UBS added SFr24 to
SFr1,208 and CS Holding was SFr55 higher at SFr2,920.
Schindler was again in favour, rising SFr290 to SFr6,300 after last week's
advances.
AMSTERDAM traded moderately higher and the CBS Tendency index gained 0.5 to
124.3. Hoogovens, the steel group, fell Fl 1.40 to Fl 43.90 after announcing
that it was to shed a total of 2,000 employees over the next three years.
MADRID seemed to accept the premise that an austere budget would be good for
equities, the general index closing 3.62 higher at 284.97.
STOCKHOLM was lifted by good six month results from Procordia, the
pharmaceuticals group, which put on SKr8 to SKr218 as the Affarsvarlden
general index rose 12.30 to 1,291.50.
OSLO was pushed higher by news from the Opec ministers meeting and the All
Share index closed up 4.12 at 549.21. Norsk Hydro was among active stocks
with a gain of NKr2.50 to NKr189.50.
COPENHAGEN built on last Friday's cut in domestic interest rates, the KFX
index rising by 1.21, or 1.3 per cent to 97.36. Carlsberg B outperformed the
market with a gain of DKr6, or 2.4 per cent to DKr256.
HELSINKI was firmer on a stable currency and lower bond yields, with the HEX
general index closing up 1.1 per cent at 1,390.1.
VIENNA remained firm helped by a rise in Steyr, the vehicle manufacturer, of
Sch8 or 5 per cent to Sch169. The ATX index ended 13.14 higher at 956.41,
although turnover was reported to have been low.
ISTANBUL held above to the 15,000 level with active buying of the cement,
petroleum and banking sectors. The composite index added 339.3 to 15,386,
off the day's high of 15,472.

FT  28 SEP 93 / World Stock Markets: Muted response to Russia developments
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Political and other news had little aggregate effect on stock markets last
week, leaving the FT-Actuaries World Index to edge slightly lower by Friday.
Europe, in the end, gave a muted response to events in Russia, while Mr
Nelson Mandela's call on Friday for an end to sanctions had been widely
discounted in Johannesburg. Even the Olympic Committee's decision on the
host city for the 2000 Games provided only a short-lived fillip to Sydney.
Mr James Cornish of NatWest Securities says that, by mid-week, the markets
had decided that Mr Boris Yeltsin would prevail and that Russia was not
facing civil war.
There was also an element of 'So what?'. Western banks had already reserved
against Russian debt and exports to Russia were providing no great bonanza
for western companies. 'Even looking at the worst case of extended civil
war, it would not make much difference,' he says.
Ms Cathy Savage, in the Nomura Research Institute's weekly review, notes
that there was some initial nervousness as Mr Yeltsin abolished the existing
Russian parliament. 'But', she adds, 'reassured by Yeltsin's control over
the essential instruments of power, the mood has since become more composed,
with even an underlying view that this is a necessary political showdown
which will eventually place Russia on a firmer, more coherent, footing to
pol-itical and economic reform.'
Olympics news brought Sydney briefly to life on Friday, with that day's rise
accounting for much of the week's gain. However, analysts noted that 70 per
cent of the facilities were already in place.
South Africa was the biggest loser of the week, in reaction to local selling
of industrials, a lack of interest in the golds sector and the strength of
the financial rand. However, the market did respond with a 1.7 per cent rise
yesterday to international moves, led by the US, to lift sanctions.

FT  28 SEP 93 / World Stock Markets: Lifting of sanctions boosts SA
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
JOHANNESBURG rallied as investors had their first opportunity to respond to
news late on Friday that sanctions were to be lifted following an appeal
from Mr Nelson Mandela, president of the African National Congress, to the
United Nations in New York.
However, some dealers commented that, while hopes for an early merging of
the financial and commercial rands had given shares a boost, the day's gains
were mainly driven by speculative buyers.
The industrial index added 81 at 4,446 and the overall index was 65 ahead at
3,795, but the gold shares index eased 3 to 1,595 as the price of bullion
weakened.
De Beers was up R5, or 6.6 per cent, at R81.

FT  28 SEP 93 / Foreign Exchanges: D-Mark up on Russian calm
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE D-MARK regained some of its strength against the dollar and European
currencies yesterday as dealers continued to think that events in Russia
were calming down, writes James Blitz.
In the last three days, President Yeltsin has regained command of the
situation in Moscow, and a key military figure yesterday announced that he
was defecting from the Russian congress grouping and moving to Mr Yeltsin's
side.
A number of worries remain. Mr Grigory Yavlinsky, the respected Russian
economist who has been a key figure in the reform movement, said yesterday
there was a chance of a serious clash breaking out in the 'White House'
parliament building in Moscow.
This did little to affect dealing, and the dollar dropped 1 3/4 pfennigs to
close at DM1.6310. It ended New York trading at DM1.6281.
Several other factors may have helped the German currency rise against the
dollar yesterday. Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the retiring Bundesbank president,
said in Washing-ton at the weekend that the US was pushing for lower
interest rates following a spate of poor indicators.
At the same time, the minutes of the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee
meeting of August 17 revealed that the central bank had moved its stance on
interest rates away from tightening, towards a neutral position. Another cut
in US rates would add to the interest premium on holding D-Marks.
US economic data were also dollar negative. US existing home sales for
August fell 1.3 per cent to an annualised 3.81m. The market had been
expecting a 0.8 per cent rise.
In Europe, the D-Mark was a shade stronger against the French franc,
finishing at FFr3.489.
Dealers said that Thursday would be an important turning point for the
'Mark/Paris' exchange rate. The French unemployment figures for August are
due out that day. Dealers are expecting a slight rise on the July
unemployment rate of 11.7 per cent. A worse figure could trigger a move out
of the current trading range towards FFr3.50.
The French authorities are also due to operate in money markets that day.
Speculation remains strong that there could be a cut in the inter-vention
rate.
The yen was little changed against the dollar in Europe. Dealers were
waiting for the results of the Clinton/Hosokawa talks in the US afternoon
before taking a firmer view on the exchange rate. However, the absence of a
communique on exchange rates at the G7 summit at the weekend led dealers to
think that the US was content with the recent Japanese stimulation package,
and had been given assur-ances about further tax-cutting measures.
The dollar ended at Y105.85 from a previous Y106.00. Sterling lost  3/4
pfennig on the day at DM2.4675. In New York the dollar closed at Y106.10.

FT  28 SEP 93 / Money Markets: Euromark futures rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BETTER performance by the D-Mark on the foreign exchanges led to a small
rise in Euromark interest rate futures yesterday, writes James Blitz.
Dealers have taken the view that the Russian crisis is calming down. The
improved performance by the German currency yesterday raised speculation
that the Bundesbank would have a little more opportunity to ease monetary
policy.
The December contract rose 2 basis points to close at 93.93, while the March
contract gained 3 basis points at 94.47.
Conditions in the German cash market remained rather tight, however. The
central bank did not remove the Paragraph 17 emergency funds which it added
on Friday. But call money nevertheless remained around 6.87 per cent
yesterday, from the 6.95 per cent seen on Friday.
There was little speculation of a variable rate repo in this week's money
market operations by the Bundesbank.
With call money above the established repo rate level of 6.70 per cent, the
central bank could trigger a repo rate rise if it holds an auction on
interest rate levels. This is probably not the message that Frankfurt wants
to send to the market.
The Bank of France disappointed a few players by leaving its intervention
rate at 6.75 per cent. There had been a powerful surge in the front-month
Pibor contract on Friday and call money came down to 7.15 per cent. A Danish
rate cut had also raised hopes of Europe-wide easing. But the December
contract was down 6 basis points on the day at 93.71.
Sterling interest rate futures received good support after weekend comments
from Mr Kenneth Clarke, the UK chancellor, in which he gave some support to
the view that there would be a rise in UK taxes in this year's budget.
Dealers speculate that a tightening in UK fiscal policy would be accompanied
by an easing of the monetary reins. The December short sterling contract
firmed 2 basis points to finish at 94.43.
In the cash market, three-month money came near to 6 per cent for the first
time in many months as the approach of the month's end led to heavy demands
on cash. A large shortage, forecast by the Bank of England at Pounds 1.6bn
at the start of trading, did not help. Once again, the major players were
reluctant to offer bills, and there was late assistance of Pounds 340m.

FT  28 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture (Farmer's Viewpoint): Hard
labour after the harvest - Late crops can make sowing for the next season a
race against time
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID RICHARDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS popularly believed that the period of hardest labour and greatest
stress on a UK arable farm is the grain harvest. Well yes, it is demanding
and often continues for 15 or more hours a day for several weeks. But if I
am honest, modern machinery and bulk handling of grain has taken much of the
sweat out of the job. And at least there is only one priority during harvest
 -to bring in the crop.
The fact is that the autumn season that follows the harvest is more frenetic
and much more diverse in the demands it makes on management and farm staff.
And if, as in some places in the north of England and in Scotland this
autumn, harvesting remains to be completed, the pressures are really severe.
For it is a matter or urgency that the seed for next autumn's crops of wheat
and barley be sown. Delay shortens the growing season from the optimum 11
months and can seriously reduce potential yield next August. Such is the
timescale to which we crop farmers have to work, and if we get it wrong we
have until next harvest to reflect on what the mistakes may have cost us.
On some of those northern farms, moreover, workers are attempting to plant
seeds for next year in the mornings and, if the weather is dry enough, to
harvest what remains of this harvest in the afternoons.
Further south the grain harvest is finished but crops such as potatoes and
sugar beet are being harvested concurrently with the autumn ploughing and
planting. It all adds up to a sustained period of intense activity and long
hours for today's tiny farm labour force and, partly because there are so
few people to do the work, the traditional gap between the grain harvest and
the autumn rush seems to become shorter every year.
But at least the summer rains have ensured that this year's root crops are
potentially profitable. Potatoes, which we do not grow on our farm, are, I
am told, yielding well, if a little below last year. Growers will not be
unhappy with that because short supplies raise prices and last season's
enormous crops pushed some ex-farm returns down to loss-making levels of
only Pounds 30 a tonne. As a result of that fewer potatoes were planted last
spring and that too is helping to keep this year's prices at more acceptable
and profitable levels.
This year's sugar beet harvest is also looking promising. Some of the
processing factories owned by British Sugar, which is the monopoly buyer of
all sugar beet grown in Great Britain, opened as early as mid-September this
year. This was 10 to 14 days before the usual date in anticipation of a big
crop and to try to avoid too much late processing through to February of
next year.
Growers hate such an extended campaign. It means that they have to store
roots on the farm from late November or early December by when it is
recommended they be lifted until their nearest factory is able to accept
them. Meanwhile the clamps must be covered and protected from winter frost.
For if roots become frozen and then rot they are unsuitable for processing
and are rejected.
But that is some months ahead. For the present I am pleased to report that
the sugar content of the first few lorry-loads of roots sent for processing
from our farm have been above 18 per cent. That is higher than average and
since growers are paid according to sugar content it means the price we
receive per tonne of beets will be better than we budgetted for.
British Sugar reports, in fact, that quality across its southern growing
area (which includes Norfolk, where I farm) is good, while further north, in
Yorkshire, sugar levels are down around 16.5 per cent. Much depends on the
amount of recent rain and the subsequent root growth. Once present, sugar
does not disappear, but if a root grows in volume the sugar concentration in
the juice declines.
Even so British Sugar predicts that the 1993 crop is on course to produce at
least 1.3m tonnes of sugar; less than last year's record of 1.46m tonnes but
still nicely above Britain's inadequate 1.14m-tonne European Community
quota.
Why inadequate? Because Britain consumes some 2.3m tonnes of sugar a year
and both farmers and British Sugar would dearly love to be allowed to come
closer to national self-sufficiency. But that's another - EC - story.
In the meantime the cat and mouse game of marketing recently harvested grain
proceeds - or, if some merchants are to be believed - does not. For cereal
growers are being accused of holding on to grain while the trade warns that
if they do not shift it now other EC supplies will replace it on the market,
UK demand will drop and prices will fall.
I am bound to concede that there is more than a grain of truth in the
merchants' tale and on our farm, at least, we plead not guilty, having sold
a fair proportion of our crop either spot or forward.
But it is fascinating to see the participants in the game issuing estimates
of the harvest that a cynic might think smacked of talking their own books.
For instance, Allied Grain and Dalgety, two of the biggest grain merchants,
have come out with estimates for the total UK harvest of almost 21m tonnes.
If they were proved accurate there could be an implied surplus over UK
requirements of some 4.5m tonnes and consequent downward pressure on prices.
United Grain Producers, a farmer-owned co-operative, puts the harvest at
20.25m tonnes, while the National Farmers' Union plumps for 19.5m tonnes.
Should that NFU figure be correct the surplus would be one third less than
that predicted by the merchants at a tonnage that could probably be exported
without too much difficulty.
As regular readers of this column will realise, I never talk my own book] I
would, however, point out that with the harvest still unfinished in the
north it may be a little premature to quote absolutes. I would further draw
attention to the fact that the recently published Ministry of Agriculture
crop census indicated that plantings for harvesting this year were down 14.8
per cent for wheat and 10.3 per cent for barley.
Both of those figures were greater, I suspect, than those used by any of the
forecasters quoted, who probably relied on a previous estimate of 9.3 per
cent as the reduction in UK cereal cropping because of set-aside.
We will not know the truth of all this until all the grain has moved off
farms before next harvest. Meanwhile, as one commentator recently put it,
the game of spoof goes on.

FT  28 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Environmental promotion planned
for jute
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KUNAL BOSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CALCUTTA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A FOUR-day international consultation on jute and the environment will be
held in the Hague from October 26 to promote the market for
environment-friendly jute products.
The consultation is being organised by the United Nations Food and
Agriculture Organisation with financial support from the European Community
and the Rockefeller Foundation.
According to an official of the Indian Jute Mills Association, the three
main objectives of the consultation will be to encourage research and
development in the production and marketing of environment-friendly jute
products; establish closer links between the jute research laboratories and
the markets; and develop marketing strategies to create an awareness of and
demand for jute products.
The jute goods producing countries like India, Bangladesh, China and
Thailand, which believe the decline in jute demand can be arrested by
projecting the environmental attributes of the natural fibre, are attaching
great importance to the consultation.
While jute scores over the synthetic substitutes because of its
biodegradability, doubts arise about its carcinogenic attributes when the
fibre is softened with petroleum products. According to the IJMA official,
the problem has now been overcome with non-edible castor oil replacing
petroleum as the softening agent.
Following this development, the hazelnut producers in Turkey have started
using hydrocarbon-free jute bags on a large scale and the Indian industry
thinks that it should now be possible to convince the coffee and cocoa
producers to use jute as the packaging material.
The FAO meeting will try to identify marketing opportunities for jute
products by taking into account 'the experience of selected exporting and
importing countries', said the official.
The producing countries acknowledge that they will have to bring about
'modifications in jute and kenaf products' to conform to the environment and
health policies of the developed countries. Producers hope to get assistance
from international agencies for environment related research and development
and technological improvements.

FT  28 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Union Carbide set to pull out
of ferrochrome
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY HAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   HARARE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
UNION CARBIDE Corporation of the US, one of Zimbabwe's two ferrochrome
producing and exporting companies has taken the first step towards
disinvestment with the appointment of an international management team to
operate its ferrochrome plant.
In an opaque statement, that makes no reference to disinvestment, Union
Carbide Corporation of the US says the new management team will be headed by
two Zimbabweans, Mr Patrick Quirke and Mr Don Bailey, both of whom are
former employees of the RTZ group.
Union Carbide has long been keen to divest itself of the ferrochrome
operation, largely because it did not fit well with the group's core
business of industrial gases and chemicals. It came close to selling the
Zimbabwe subsidiary to RTZ of the UK last year but the deal fell through at
the 11th hour largely because of the collapse of the ferrochrome market in
the face of unprecedented Russian exports.
Mr Bailey was a key figure on the RTZ side in these negotiations and he will
now direct the ferrochrome operation in Zimbabwe, while also exploring
prospects for developing one of three platinum prospects currently under
investigation in the country.
Union Carbide Zimbabwe owns the Mimosa platinum prospect, while BHP-Utah and
Delta Gold of Australia are investigating the Hartley deposit and a
consortium of Anglo America Corporation of Zimbabwe, Rio Tinto Zimbabwe and
Robertson Mining also have a project under investigation.
Mining industry executives say that the development is positive from both
the ferrochrome and the platinum viewpoints. It has long been clear that
Union Carbide in the US was not interested in investing in either the
ferrochrome or platinum mines. The apparent hope is that the new management
team will be able to strengthen the ferrochrome operation, which is
struggling at present because of the depressed global market and sharply
higher domestic costs, as well as developing Mimosa platinum mine.
The country's other ferrochrome producer, Zimbabwe Alloys, owned by Anglo
American says energy costs, which have risen dramatically in the last few
years, now account for about half total costs. Last year, Union Carbide's
Zimbabwe subsidiary, Zimasco, had total sales of some ZDollars 500m
(USDollars 100m).

FT  28 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Stocks of base metals show
remorseless growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RECESSION IN much of the industrialised world has brought remorseless growth
in stocks of traded metals. With the exception of tin, all other major
non-ferrous metal stocks in the hands of producers, consumers, traders and
the London Stock Exchange, have doubled since the end of 1990.
Figures released by the World Bureau of Metal Statistics show aluminium
stocks up 2m to 4.15m tonnes at the end of June; copper stocks up from
692,000 to 1.246m tonnes; lead stocks up from 382,000 to 667,000 tonnes;
nickel stocks up from 89,000 to 198,000 tonnes; and zinc stocks up from
567,000 to 1.207m tonnes.
Tin stocks, which were at record levels after the collapse of a price
support scheme in 1985, slipped from 39,000 tonnes at the end of 1990 to
31,000 tonnes in June this year.
Nickel suffered the sharpest drop in output among the traded metals in the
first half of this year, according to the bureau.
Refined nickel output in the western world dropped by 8.1 per cent to
285,000 tonnes. Tin was also badly hit by lacklustre world economic activity
and production was down by 6.9 per cent to 67,000 tonnes.
However, despite aluminium prices being the lowest ever in real terms,
output climbed by 1.8 per cent to 7.45m tonnes at a time when consumption
was falling by 1 per cent to 7.688m tonnes.
The statistics show clearly how lead and zinc mines cut back drastically in
the face of low prices but smelters continued to keep producing refined
metal at a relatively high rate. Mine output of lead was down 5.4 per cent
but production of refined lead was up 1.4 per cent. Zinc mine output slipped
4.2 per cent but the refineries produced 0.6 per cent more slab zinc.
The statistics give a confusing picture of the copper market by showing
refined production at 4.487m tonnes, consumption at 4.747m tonnes, a deficit
in east-west trade and a supply deficit of 323,000 tonnes. Yet total western
world stocks have grown from just over 1m tonnes at the end of 1992 to
1.246m tonnes, which suggests a supply surplus - a better reflection of the
market as most analyst see it.
Behind this confusion is a lack of metals statistics from the Commonwealth
of Independent States, a hang-over from the days when these were deemed to
be state secrets, which continues to cause big headaches for analysts in the
west.
Metal imported to the west from the CIS can take months to appear on
official statistics. It may be put in bonded warehouses and remain there for
a long time before being cleared through customs.
Mr Lloyd Davies, general manager of the WBMS, says that consumption data
must also be treated with some caution since it is based on essentially
incomplete trade statistics for European Community countries. This is a
consequence of the introduction of the so-called Intrastat system of
recording intra-EC trade, which is only now beginning to produce useful
information.

TIN and NICKEL prices reversed last week's rallies at the London Metal
Exchange yesterday. Tin suffered what dealers termed a 'mini-collapse' in
late trading as a flurry of European selling found buyers thin on the
ground. Final business for the three months delivery position was at Dollars
4,505 a tonne, down Dollars 105 from Friday. Meanwhile nickel's more
cheerful appearance gave way in the face of predictions of further increases
in exchange warehouse stocks, which are already at a record level. The three
months price closed Dollars 122.50 down at Dollars 4,267.50 a tonne, in
spite of sellers being cautious following Inco's announcement last week that
it was talking to unions about output cuts. At the London Commodity Exchange
COCOA prices fell back further from recent highs, with near December futures
losing Pounds 13 at Pounds 903 a tonne. 'I don't think it's anything
specific, said one traders. 'It's time to take a little bit of profit.' At
the London bullion market the GOLD price lost early gains on perceptions
that the Moscow crisis had eased slightly. The price finished at Dollars
354.25 a troy ounce, down Dollars 3 from Friday.

FT  28 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Coffee pact to survive US
withdrawal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DEFECTION of the US is unlikely to kill off the International Coffee
Agreement, for the time being at least. Sufficient importing members have
already agreed to a one-year extension of the pact and the International
Coffee Organisation is confident that the one extra exporting member it
needs will signal its accession within the next few days.
Nevertheless the loss of the biggest consumers has been acknowledged to be a
serious blow, not least because of the loss of the large US contribution to
the ICO budget.
For the coffee market the news, released on Sunday, was of limited immediate
interest as the ICA's efforts to support prices have been suspended since
1989, and it has been operating only as a forum for the exchange of views
between producers and consumers and as a centre for monitoring the coffee
market.
In early business at the London Commodity Exchange yesterday coffee traders,
who are more interested at the moment in the producers' export retention
scheme, which comes into effect on Friday, marked futures prices modestly
higher.
Anticipation of the producer scheme, under which up to 20 per cent of coffee
production will be held off the market, has already pushed prices up
significantly. But it also appears to have been the last straw for the
Americans, who have never been regarded as whole-hearted supporters of the
agreement.
In an explanatory statement issued yesterday the US delegation to the
London-based ICO said that 'opposition to unilateral producer action, formed
outside international commodity agreements, remains the official US stance'.
The producers decision to 'go their own way' had resulted in US the
administration being 'unable to marshal strong arguments in favour of the
agreement' in order to defeat the usual congress amendment to the budget
Bill seeking to deny funding for US participation in the agreement.
'In short,' declared the US statement, 'the United States can no longer
justify participation in the ICA'.

FT  28 SEP 93 / Government Bonds: Treasuries post strong long-end gains on
Fed move
</HEADLINE>

US TREASURY prices posted exceptionally strong gains at the long end of the
market yesterday as last Friday's news of a subtle shift in the Federal
Reserve's policy stance continued to provide support for investor sentiment.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up 1 5/32 at 104
3/16 , yielding 5.944 per cent. At the short end of the market, the two-year
note was up  1/16 at 100 1/8 , to yield 3.793 per cent.
Prices rallied strongly late last week after the minutes from the August
meeting of the Fed's Open Market Committee were released showing that the
central bank's policy-makers had voted to shift the bias of monetary policy
back to neutral from its previous stance of a possible tightening. That
rally caught many dealers short of bonds, and as buyers returned to the
market yesterday, prices rose sharply at the long end of the maturity range.
The early firm tone of trading was also helped by the day's economic news of
a 1.3 per cent decline in August existing home sales, and by end-of-quarter
'window dressing', when investment managers buy bonds in the hope of driving
up the value of their assets for quarterly accounting purposes.
EUROPEAN government bonds rose in early trading on relief that the weekend
had brought no escalation of political tensions in Russia, but eased back in
the afternoon to end only slightly firmer. Retail activity was scant and
trade remained technical, with the futures pits once again setting the pace.
German government bonds jumped nearly  1/2 point at the opening, but shed
most of their early gains in the absence of follow-through buying. With
little in the way of market-moving data or news, prices remained range-bound
on moderate volume.
At today's announcement of Bundesbank securities repurchase agreements, most
dealers are calling for another round of fixed-rate repos rather than a
return to variable-rate repos. Given current tightness in the money market,
a switch to variable-rate repos could actually push the repo rate above last
week's fixed 6.70 per cent, sending the wrong signal, traders said.
FRENCH government bonds underperformed bunds in quiet trade. The yield on
the 10-year French government benchmark ended on a par with its German
counterpart at 6.10 per cent, after yielding 5 basis points fewer on Friday.
Early hopes that the Bank of France would ease interest rates at its repo
allocation were disappointed, causing price slippage in the afternoon.
Moreover, bond market sentiment was dampened by the franc's weakness on the
foreign exchanges.
Traders are focusing on August jobs data, due for release on Thursday, as
well as industrial production numbers expected some time this week.
UK gilts had a quiet day, with futures prices supported by firmness in the
German market but little cash activity reported. The December long gilt
contract ended at 112 27/32 , up  7/32 from Friday. Prices are expected to
remain range-bound today ahead of tomorrow's auction of Pounds 3.25bn of 6
3/4 per cent gilts due 2004.
ITALIAN bonds were among the day's strongest performers, gaining more than
1/2 point on the day.
The December BTP future on Liffe ended at 114.87, up 0.64 point from Friday
and is expected to test technical resistance at 115.05 today.
Friday's late announcement that the government will soon implement a law
enabling foreign investors to reclaim withholding tax charged on interest
income from Italian bonds had boosted prices, said Mr Andrew Roberts, bond
analyst at UBS.
This triggered switching into higher-coupon bonds yesterday, Mr Roberts
added.
Spanish bonds also rose, boosted mainly by the firm tone in most other
European markets. The December notional Bonos contract traded in Madrid rose
by 0.66 point to 99.24.
JAPANESE government bonds hit a six-year high for the second consecutive
trading day, with the December JGB future rising to 112.51, from 112.28 on
Friday.

FT  28 SEP 93 / International Capital Markets: European banks expect returns
on equity of 10%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOST senior European bank executives expect competition over the next decade
to force down banks' annual returns on capital to an average of 10 per cent
 -well below the level many have set as a target for their own banks.
A survey of 65 executives has found that despite the number setting target
returns on equity of at least 15 per cent, most privately think this is
unsustainable. They believe mergers will be forced by competition and
falling profits from corporate banking.
Nearly a third of executives interviewed by the consultants Gemini
Consulting and EFMA believed there would be a significant number of bank
bankruptcies by the year 2005 as banks try to cut costs. Some 68 per cent
believed only 15 to 20 significant European retail banks would remain.
Mr Mark Tilden, a vice-president of Gemini Consulting, said the study had
shown that executives were privately pessimistic about the industry and the
erosion of lending margins caused by competition. 'They think there is a
difficult period ahead,' he said.
The executives, from 15 countries, were particularly doubtful about the
future profitability of corporate banking. Some 78 per cent thought
'disintermediation' - the provision of their own financial services by big
corporations - would continue to undermine bank profits.
The chief effect of this process to date has been to reduce margins on
corporate loans as large companies find it cheaper to issue their own
securities than to borrow from banks. But executives also expected companies
to provide other forms of banking services themselves.
Some 88 per cent of executives thought that large corporations would provide
their own cash management services, 67 per cent thought they would carry out
foreign-exchange dealing, and 63 per cent thought they would provide their
own medium- and long-term finance.
About a quarter thought that fewer than 10 European banks would be
undertaking corporate banking by 2005. Mr Tilden said that banks were
already finding it hard to gain a role in corporate banking aside from
offering to manage company risk through derivative products.
Only 48 per cent of executives thought that corporate banking would be a
significant contributor to profits at the end of the period. However, some
bankers believed they would have to continue to offer loans to companies in
order to attract other business.
Executives mostly believed that the retreat from banks having retail branch
networks in other countries would continue. Only 28 per cent thought that
their own bank would have a significant retail banking presence in another
country, given the competitive pressures.

FT  28 SEP 93 / International Bonds: NatWest in Pounds 300m mortgage-backed
notes debut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE sterling mortgage-backed market received a significant boost yesterday
as National Westminster Bank launched its first issue of mortgage-backed
notes.
An official at NatWest Capital Markets said that the Pounds 300m issue,
which was divided into three tranches, sold out quickly to investors in east
Asia, Europe and the UK.
The official added that the issue, the largest sterling mortgage-backed deal
to date, helped to build up badly-needed liquidity in this market.
Of the three tranches, the Pounds 150m worth of Class A2 notes proved the
most popular with investors. They were attracted by the notes' relatively
long average life of 5.08 years and the 40 basis-point spread over the
three-month sterling London interbank offered rate (Libor).
When these notes were freed to trade, they traded at a small premium to
their re-offer price of par. By contrast, the spread on the Pounds 144m
worth of Class A1 notes of 20 basis points over Libor was thought to be too
tight. These notes, which have an average life of 1.83 years, traded around
their par issue price in the afternoon.
Commenting on the issue, Mr Richard Goeltz, NatWest's group chief financial
officer, said: 'Securitisation is increasingly being used by banks to manage
balance sheets and enhance profitability.'
Other UK clearing banks are expected to follow NatWest's lead. Barclays
Bank, the first UK clearing bank to tap this sector with a Pounds 175m issue
in 1989, is likely to launch a mortgage-backed issue of between Pounds 250m
and Pounds 300m before the end of the year.
Barclays is also expected to launch an asset-backed issue of a similar size
next week. The issue will be backed by consumer loans and the notes will
have an average life of one to two years.
In the D-Mark sector, Bank Nederlandse Gemeenten (BNG), the Dutch bank which
funds local authorities, raised DM1bn through an issue of 15-year Eurobonds.
BNG is only the second issuer to launch a D-Mark offering with a 15-year
maturity. LKB Baden Wurttemberg Finance opened up this area of the D-Mark
yield curve in late August with a DM1bn offering, which was increased by
DM500m in September.
The pricing of 15-year D-Mark Eurobonds is hindered by the lack of a German
government bond benchmark with this maturity, and issuers are expected to
monitor closely the performance of these two issues before deciding whether
to follow suit.
At launch, LKB's bonds were priced to yield 36 basis points over the 6 1/2
per cent German government bond due 2003, but the spread has widened to
around 42 basis points.
BNG's bonds were priced to yield 47 basis points over the corresponding
German government bond, but this was widely thought to be too tight. Traders
said the spread widened to around 50 basis points by the late afternoon.
An official at the lead manager Trinkhaus und Burkhardt said that the bonds
were bought by retail investors in the Benelux countries.
Elsewhere, the Republic of Argentina, encouraged by the success of its
recent D-Mark Eurobond issue, is planning to launch a dollar global bond
issue by December. Merrill Lynch is believed to have won the mandate.

THE Chicago Mercantile Exchange is to extend the time its products are

by Reuters and Chicago's two futures exchanges, writes Laurie Morse in
Chicago.
The longer hours, which take effect on November 1, will eliminate a
late-afternoon pause and bring the system closer to its intended 24-hour
global operation. CME currency and interest rate products will trade
continuously on Globex from early afternoon through to 6am next morning. The
Chicago Board of Trade is not taking part in the move towards 'seamless'

THE TASMANIAN Government Insurance Office (TGIO) has been sold to Fortis
Australia for ADollars 53.5m (USDollars 35m), Reuter reports from Hobart.
Fortis Australia is part of the Fortis Dutch-Belgian insurance group.
The decision to sell TGIO was announced last year by the state government of
Tasmania. The move is aimed at reducing the state's ADollars 3bn of
borrowings.
Mr Tony Rundle, TGIO treasurer, said the group would retain its Tasmanian
identity, with its head office to remain in the state. The deal is subject
to approval from the Foreign Investment Review Board.

Earlier this month, Telecom Australia, the government-owned
telecommunications carrier, awarded a contract to AWA to provide a
demonstration system based on this technology. Under the partnership, AWA
will provide the switching and transmission equipment, with Siemens
supplying the networking 'know-how'.
The two companies claim the equipment market could be worth ADollars 500m

FT  28 SEP 93 / International Company News: Cavallo lifts capital market
hopes - The implications of Argentina's pensions reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ARGENTINA'S pensions reform, which the senate approved last week, could
eventually channel Dollars 3bn a year into local financial markets.
The approval is an important victory for economy minister Mr Domingo Cavallo
in his battle to modernise the economy. The reform is aimed at revitalising
the financial system, as well as improving pension benefits and reducing the
cost to the state of its pay-as-you-go pension scheme.
One US banker said: 'For the first time, we can think about creating a local
capital market. For the first time in many years, companies will get access
to long-term local capital, which reduces dependence on foreign capital.'
The new system, partially modelled on Chile's private pension scheme, offers
contributors a choice between opening individual retirement savings accounts
managed by private companies, or remaining in the state-run system. In
addition, the state will continue to provide a basic pension for all
contributors.
This basic pension will be funded out of payroll taxes and fixed percentages
of value-added and income taxes. Employers will pay 16 per cent of wages to
fund the basic state pension, two percentage points less than at present.
The reduction is aimed at making corporate Argentina more competitive.
Employees will pay 11 per cent of wages either to privately managed funds or
to the state fund managed by Banco de la Nacion Argentina (BNA), the
country's biggest commercial bank. Employees presently pay 13 per cent of
wages into the government social security system.
Baring Securities of the UK estimates that private pension systems will hold
assets of Dollars 30bn by the end of the century.
A maximum of 50 per cent of assets can be held in equities or government
securities while up to 40 per cent can be invested in corporate debt or bank
certificates of deposit.
Baring expects fund managers to begin investing towards the end of 1994,
with cash flowing mainly to fixed income rather than equity investments.
The private system will be supervised by a government regulator. Independent
credit rating agencies will monitor each fund's portfolios. Administrators
will also contribute to several emergency and reserve funds.
The government believes it can finance its continuing commitment to
pensioners covered by the old state-run system by cracking down on social
security evasion, which is estimated to be running close to 50 per cent of
contributions.
The pension reform is one of Argentina's most radical and controversial
economic changes. There is a deeply-rooted belief among politicians that
pensions should not be used to profit the private sector and should remain
with the government.
As a result, BNA has to provide pensions with a government-guaranteed
dollar-linked yield.
BNA is also exempt from the 1.5 per cent commission charged by private fund
managers, who claim that this will make it difficult to compete with the
BNA-run scheme.
However, foreign bankers believe that the state sector's reputation for
inefficiency will push plenty of potential clients towards the private
sector.
There is concern that the guaranteed yield on the state scheme would
represent a significant financial liability in the event of a currency
devaluation.
The government plans to alter this requirement when it draws up detailed
regulations.

estimates as yen rises
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FANUC, the Japanese machine tool maker, yesterday cut its sales and profits
estimates for the year, blaming the rise in the yen and a decline in demand.
Pre-tax profits are expected to fall by 28 per cent to Y21bn (Dollars
198.11m) in the year ending March, after plunging by 44 per cent in the
previous 12 months. Earlier, Fanuc had estimated that it would make Y27.6bn
before tax in the current year.
Sales are set to fall by 10.4 per cent to Y105.4bn, said Fanuc. Earlier this
year, it had forecast a slight rise in turnover, to Y120bn for 1993-94 from
last year's Y117.7bn.
In response, the group plans to cut spending on research and development
done outside the company, buy more components from overseas and seek more
repair work, said Mr Koji Saito, senior managing director.
Fanuc expects tough conditions in the industrial robots market in the second
half of the year. In this sector it depends heavily on exports, where the
yen's rise has pushed up Japanese prices in foreign currency terms.
At home, Fanuc's industrial customers are curbing investment as they slim
capacity in line with declining demand.

   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WORLD International, the Hong Kong holding company for the late Sir Y. K.
Pao's stock market-listed empire, is to change its name to Wheelock and
Company in an attempt to reassert itself as a traditional hong, or trading
conglomerate.
The new name crystalises a change in strategy for the group, which had
previously focused management attentions on the larger 44 per cent-owned
property investment company, Wharf Holdings.
Wheelock, founded in Shanghai in 1857, was one of southern China's most
prominent trading houses. The bulk of the group's businesses were taken over
in 1985 by the World group, which evolved into little more than an
investment holding company for stakes in Wharf, department store operator
Lane Crawford, and various listed property interests.
The rationale for the name change is clearly to distance the group further
from Sir Y. K. Pao's Worldwide Shipping group, and to re-establish itself
under his son-in-law Mr Peter Woo as one of the four largest hongs,
alongside Hutchison Whampoa, Jardine Matheson, and Swire Pacific.
The aim would clearly be to lift the company's stock market rating from that
of an investment holding company, to that of a broadly-based trading house:
the Pao family's sole group shareholding is its 59 per cent stake in World.
Mr Woo announced that he would step down to the post of honorary chairman of
Wharf at the end of next year in order to concentrate his activities on
World and on his charity commitments.
Mr John Hung, who has also moved to become executive director of World, said
the company planned to expand its interests into consumer businesses,
trading, and financial services.
He said the Wheelock name was well known in China, and might aid its
expansion into consumer-related activities on the mainland.
Wharf is now being promoted as the asset-intensive part of the group, with
its property and infra-structure portfolio, while World will concentrate on
management-intensive businesses. Analysts suggest that there could be some
inter-group asset swaps in order to fine-tune the corporate realignment.

FT  28 SEP 93 / International Company News: Schwab expects sharp rise in
third term

CHARLES SCHWAB, the largest discount brokerage company in the US, said
yesterday it expects to post a sharp increase in third-quarter profits to
between Dollars 18m and Dollars 21m when it releases its latest
three-monthly earnings next month. In the same quarter a year ago, it earned
just Dollars 7.8m.
Although Schwab said its third-quarter earnings this year would show a big
improvement on a year ago, the third quarter of 1992 was an unusually weak
period for the firm.
Its latest earnings, while up sharply from a year ago, will still be below
the first and second quarters of this year, when the broker reported net
income of Dollars 35.4m and Dollars 31.6m, respectively. This steady, if
modest, decline in earnings during 1993 suggests that, while stock markets
have been reaching record highs and investor interest in equities has been
booming, the overall level of trading activity may have peaked.
Results for the full year, however, will still come in considerably higher
than the Dollars 81.2m earned in 1992, which was itself a record.
Schwab said its latest earnings would have been higher but for a Dollars
6.8m one-time extraordinary charge, which it is taking to cover the costs of
refinancing some of its debt.
The firm also said customer assets at the end of this quarter will total
Dollars 86bn, up Dollars 20bn from the start of the year and up almost 50
per cent from the end of the 1992's third quarter.

FT  28 SEP 93 / International Company News: Innovation in a cut-throat world
 -Nikki Tait finds out how Gillette emerged a little better than the rest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TO most people, Gillette is a quintessential consumer products business
which, by implication, ought to be obsessed with market shares and marketing
strategies. It comes as a surprise, then, to find Mr Al Zeien, its chairman,
drawing parallels with the pharmaceuticals sector, where product innovation
rules.
'If you study a pharmaceuticals company,' he says, 'the chairman will show
you all the bar charts, and say: 'Here is where we started out with drug XYZ
10 years ago', and it has a bar which runs into 1996. 'Here's a drug we
introduced six years ago', and that runs into 1999. And so on.
'We're not that different. If you take our blade business, we introduced
Trac-II in 1972 and we're still selling it, still adding capacity on a
worldwide basis, although in the more developed markets, the tails are
running down. It's a bar on the pharmaceuticals chart.'
Mr Zeien can think of two products, already designed, which he knows will
not be brought to the market by Boston-based Gillette until the latter half
of the decade. He also mentions a research programme for a product that has
a launch date after 2000. 'Now that doesn't sound like a packaged goods
company, does it?'
It doesn't, yet it is easy see why Gillette managers should be so keen to
play up the product side of their business. Time and again, the capacity to
produce timely innovations has rescued Gillette when problems loomed.
The most recent instance was in the late 1980s. For decades, Gillette held a
commanding position in the shaving equipment market, seeing off challenges
from the likes of the UK's Wilkinson Sword, which pioneered a stainless
steel blade in the 1960s.
But in the 1980s sales of disposable razors - which are generally less
profitable for manufacturers - exploded, due mainly to the efforts of
France's Bic. Eventually, they came to account for over half the shaving
market's turnover, compared with about one-fifth at the start of the decade.
Gillette clung to a leading position in the disposables market, but its
margins were squeezed. The company attracted the attention of predators:
first, Mr Ronald Perelman, the Drexel-backed financier who took over
cosmetics company Revlon, and then Coniston Partners, a New York-based
investment outfit.
In the process of seeing off these threats, Gillette bought out share stakes
and took on about Dollars 2bn of extra debt. It also overhauled operations
and axed some 2,400 jobs, about 8 per cent of the workforce.
The company's salvation emerged from its UK research laboratories. Four
years ago, Gillette launched its Sensor razor - a product which had been
conceived years earlier and whose spring-mounted twin blades are designed to
follow the shape of the face, producing a closer, more comfortable shave.
Research, engineering and tooling cost around Dollars 200m; Gillette then
wagered big-time, sinking the bulk of its advertising budget into the
product.
There is clear evidence that the gamble paid off. Sensor has taken about
one-fifth of the US market, and can justly claim to have reversed the
disposable sector's inroads. Equally important, the new razor has improved
Gillette's margins: one analyst estimates that the first-quarter operating
margin in the North Atlantic shaving products division was about 41 per cent
this year, compared with 34 per cent in 1990.
Gillette has since produced a 'Sensor For Women', and is rolling out an
upgraded Sen-sorExcel product later this year. The refined SensorExcel adds
a skin guard and incorporates an 'improved' handle, and will be launched in
Europe. It will also sell at a useful 15 to 20 per cent premium to the basic
Sensor.
But the attempt to think along pharmaceutical industry lines - and
concentrating on evolving product 'families' - has not just been a strategy
for developed markets. Mr Tony Levy, vice-president of Gillette's
international group, points out that the objective in less-developed
countries now centres on buying into a market which is dominated by
'low-technology' blades, and then steadily pushing it towards more
sophisticated (and higher margin) products.
'Plank one is to go from a low double-edged blade to a cartridge system,
which is three or four times the price,' he says.
Latin America is Mr Levy's favourite example. Back in the late 1970s,
Gillette commanded over 80 per cent of the region's shaving equipment sales,
but 92 per cent were in the form of double-edged blades. By 1992, he claims,
double-edged blades were down to 32 per cent, and cartridges had risen to 68
per cent. The total market value, meanwhile, had increased from Dollars 192m
to Dollars 586m.
Mr Zeien may seem a little disingenuous, making so much of the product side
of its business and emphasising the extent of the differentiation, just as
consumer industries generally are under attack from own-label rivals. But he
also notes that the emphasis on product development is supported by a
complex management structure which has been in place for years.
Gillette calls this 'matrix' management, a concept which was first developed
at Braun, its German-based appliance subsidiary. Essentially, the idea is to
split the development of a product category from the day-to-day marketing.
'We have strategic business units, which are responsible for the product
lines,' explains Mr Zeien. 'That is, the product development, central
marketing approach, and for the R&amp;D. And then the tactical marketing is done
by geography.'
In the blade business, for example, the product development side is headed
by Mr Robert Murray, vice-president of the North Atlantic shaving and
personal products group. But the 'actual tactical marketing and selling' in
the US is the immediate responsibility of Mr Ronald Rossi, president of the
North American division.
There is little doubt among analysts that Gillette's approach has produced a
core razors business which is well-run and highly successful. Last year, it
accounted for about 38 per cent of Gillette's Dollars 5.2bn sales, but 68
per cent of group operating profits. What is more questionable is whether
some of the company's past diversification moves - into toiletries, for
example - have been equally suited to the same philosophy.
Mr Zeien admits that there have been mishaps in the past, but he points out
that the toiletries division has now been stripped down to five brands,
compared with more than twice that 10 years ago.
He sees no reason not to add another arm to the group, which already
encompasses stationery products, the Oral-B toothcare division, Braun and
cosmetics, as well as the core razors operations.
Assuming, that is, that the right business can be found. 'We are not
interested in businesses which are not susceptible to technical innovation,
where products can't be differentiated. It would have to be a business which
depends on capturing customers rather than selling products.'

<TEXT>
CREDIT Lyonnais, the French bank which owns Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, yesterday
said it had no immediate plans to sell the Hollywood film studio following
an announcement by Mr William Koch that he plans to make an offer for the
company.
Mr Koch, winner of the 1992 Americas Cup yacht race, is chairman and biggest
shareholder of Kendall Square Research, a supercomputer company.
He said yesterday that he had retained International Creative Management
(ICM), the powerful Hollywood talent agency, and its chairman to advise him.
'At this point, it is my goal for our team to amass enough information to
put together a preliminary offer within the next 30 to 60 days,' he said.
Credit Lyonnais took control of MGM last year after forclosing on loans it
made to Mr Giancarlo Parretti, an Italian entrepreneur who bought the
company in 1990 from Mr Kirk Kerkorian for Dollars 1.3bn. Credit Lyonnais is
involved in litigation with Mr Kerkorian.
In a letter to MGM's chairman, Mr Frank Mancuso, Credit Lyonnais said last
week: 'Everyone at MGM/UA should rest assured MGM/UA is not for sale.' Under
US banking law Credit Lyonnais must sell the studio by 1997.

<TEXT>
THE CARLYLE Group, a Washington-based investment banking group that features
former US secretary of state Mr James Baker among its partners, plans to
seek fresh institutional investment in Europe in the next few weeks to help
finance a new Dollars 500m buy-out fund.
Mr George Soros, the New York-based investor, has agreed to put up the first
Dollars 100m 'anchor' investment in the new fund, according to Mr David
Rubenstein, a managing partner of Carlyle.
'We are very pleased that George Soros has selected us to be a vehicle for
his investment activity. We plan to use the Dollars 500m fund as the equity
segment of purchases in the defence, aerospace and other sectors,' he said
yesterday.
Among Carlyle's holdings is Vought Aircraft, the Texas-based company that
consists of the former aircraft division of LTV. Carlyle also manages
defence contractors, airline catering businesses and a book distributor.
Carlyle, which was founded more than six years ago with seed money from the
Mellon family of Pittsburgh, already controls companies in the defence,
telecommunications, aerospace and service industries that have Dollars 5bn
of combined revenues.
Mr Baker joined Carlyle as one of seven partners, each of which is believed
to earn more than Dollars 2m a year, soon after he left the Bush
administration. Another former Bush administration official who has become a
Carlyle partner is Mr Dick Darman, the former director of the Office of
Management and Budget. The chairman of Carlyle is Mr Frank Carlucci, the
former defence secretary.

FT  28 SEP 93 / International Company News: German engineer to raise DM202m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MANNESMANN, the diversified German engineering group, announced a rights
issue yesterday which it said would help it fight recession and continue
diversification, Reuter reports from Bonn.
The group said it would raise its capital by DM201.9m (Dollars 122.5m) to
DM1.8bn through a one-for-eight rights issue in mid-October.
The new shares, the price of which will be set near the issue date, will be
entitled to half a dividend on results from the current business year, to
September 30.
'The capital increase will serve to ensure growth and structural change,'
Mannesmann said. 'Restructuring measures to improve profitability introduced
in all areas of the company will still burden earnings in 1993 but will
considerably lower the break-even threshold and show a clear improvement of
profits in 1994,' it added.
The company posted a net loss of DM467m in the first six months of the
current year.
Mannesmann also sought to allay fears that it would not pay a dividend on
results from its current business year.
'The capital increase also underlines the intention of the management board
to do justice to the interests of shareholders with an adequate rate of
return on their invested capital,' it said. The group paid a dividend of DM6
a share in 1992.
While giving no indication that its core businesses were close to returning
to profit, Mannesmann said its mobile telephone division, Mannesmann
Mobilfunk, would make a profit sooner than expected. Earlier forecasts were
that it would not make a profit until 1995 after breaking even in the second
half of 1994.
Mannesmann earlier denied a report in Der Spiegel magazine that Mr Werner
Dieter, its chairman, had come under pressure to resign because of big
losses. A spokesman called the allegations 'pure speculation' and said Mr
Dieter's resignation had not been discussed by the supervisory board.

TIME WARNER, the largest US entertainment group, and Spiegel, a leading
specialty fashion retailer and catalogue company, joined forces yesterday to
create two new cable television channels in the fast-growing field of home
shopping.
The channels will focus mainly on women between the ages of 25 and 55 and
sell up-market clothing and goods for the family and home.
Television home shopping, after failing to produce exciting growth in the
1980s, is suddenly attracting strong interest among media and retailing
groups as the US prepares for an era of interactive, multi-media home
entertainment.
Investor interest in the sector quickened last December when Mr Barry
Diller, a leading film industry figure, became chairman of home shopping
group QVC Network, which this month launched a hostile takeover battle for
entertainment group Paramount Communications. QVC is also in takeover
negotiations with Home Shopping Network, the other leading company in the
sector.
One of the Time Warner/Spiegel channels, with the working title 'The Catalog
Channel', will be a 24-hour service offering goods from a wide range of
specialty catalogue companies. It will also provide entertainment, news and
interviews on fashion and home products. Customers will order goods on the
telephone.
Spiegel will include goods from its 500-page catalogue and that of Eddie
Bauer, which concentrates on up-market, active outdoor lifestyle goods. The
joint venture is discussing participation with other up-market catalogue
companies, each of which would have its own time slot.
The two companies said the second channel would be the interactive video
equivalent of a shopping mall. It would consist of a number of catalogues,
stored on video, which customers could call up on demand, view a variety of
goods in full motion, and then buy goods by simply pressing keys on a
television set remote control.
The second service, which requires advanced communications technology, will
be introduced next year in Orlando, Florida, where Time Warner is building a
commercial prototype of an interactive home video network.

WELLA, the German personal products specialist, has taken a controlling
stake in Sebastian International, a Los Angeles hair-care company, which
will double its share of the US salon products market to around 8 per cent.
Sebastian, a leading 'designer' brand with a 'trend-setting' environmental
accent, according to Wella, has annual sales of more than Dollars 80m, of
which 18 per cent comes from exports.
The company said it expected turnover in the US from existing activities
this year to reach DM90m (Dollars 55m), compared with total group sales last
year of DM2.75bn.
Neither the size of the holding nor the price paid to the family owners was
disclosed.
The purchase is Wella's second strategically important acquisition this
year. In June it paid DM138m for SmithKline Beecham's Silvikrin, Bristows
and Vosene hair-care brands.
Wella's pre-tax profits for the first half of the current year rose by 3 per
cent to DM66m on turnover up 1.4 per cent to DM1.33bn.

The second service, which requires advanced communications technology, will

commercial prototype of an interactive home video network.
Each catalogue company taking part in the channels would be responsible for
its own ordering, fulfilment of orders, billing and inventory. QVC and Home
Shopping Network handle these functions themselves.
The new channels will fill a different niche to QVC, but should provide some
competition to that network, which has been trying to move its merchandise
up-market. Home Shopping Network merchandise is relatively down-market.
The new services will also give Time Warner, which runs the second-largest
cable television service in the US, a substantial position in the home
shopping business.
Time Warner rival Tele-Communications Inc, the largest cable company in the
US, already has important ties to the industry through Mr John Malone, its
chief executive, who holds a controlling stake in Liberty Media, which in
turn has a large interest in QVC.
The Catalog Channel is to be launched in certain Time Warner cable systems
in the first quarter of next year, and expects to launch nationally later in
the year.
Mr Thayer Bigelow, president of Time Warner cable programming, said:
'Catalogue shopping is a Dollars 51bn business that is an excellent
opportunity for cable to create substantial new revenue streams.'

WELLA, the German personal products specialist, has taken a controlling
stake in Sebastian International, a Los Angeles hair-care company, which
will double its share of the US salon products market to around 8 per cent.
Sebastian, a leading 'designer' brand with a 'trend-setting' environmental
accent, according to Wella, has annual sales of more than Dollars 80m, of
which 18 per cent comes from exports.
The company said it expected turnover in the US from existing activities
this year to reach DM90m (Dollars 55m), compared with total group sales last
year of DM2.75bn.
Neither the size of the holding nor the price paid to the family owners was
disclosed.
The purchase is Wella's second modest but strategically important
acquisition this year. In June it paid DM138m for SmithKline Beecham's
Silvikrin, Bristows and Vosene hair-care brands to bolster its position in
the UK and Middle East.
The UK and Ireland together account for around 70 per cent of the three
brands' annual sales of DM110m.
Wella's pre-tax profits for the first half of the current year rose by 3 per
cent to DM66m on turnover up 1.4 per cent to DM1.33bn. In its first-half
report last month the group said it expected sales for the year, including
contributions from the SmithKline brands, to rise by between 4 per cent and
6 per cent.

FT  28 SEP 93 / International Company News: Philip Morris in Kazakhstan deal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
PHILIP MORRIS, the US tobacco and food products group, is to become the
first foreign company to acquire a significant stake in a privatised
enterprise in the former Soviet republic of Kazakhstan, under the terms of
an agreement announced yesterday.
The company, which already has a strong presence in eastern Europe and
Russia, said it had agreed to a deal in which it would gain control of
Almaty Tobacco Kombinat, a Kazakhstan cigarette manufacturing operation
which employs 1,700.
Initially, Philip Morris will take a 49 per cent interest in ATK, with its
stake building to more than 90 per cent within a year. ATK's management and
staff would hold the rest.
Terms of the transaction were not disclosed, but the group said it was
committed to spending at least Dollars 200m over the next five years to
modernise ATK's manufacturing facilities.
Mr Andreas Gembler, president of Philip Morris Europe's eastern Europe,
Middle East and Africa operating region, said: 'Kazakhstan is certain to
play a key strategic role in the economic development of central Asia.'
The group said it envisioned the country becoming a net exporter of tobacco
products within a few years.
The immediate goal is to boost annual capacity from 12bn to 20bn cigarettes,
the approximate number smoked in Kazakhstan a year.
Local brands as well as Philip Morris's main international brands -
including Marlboro, L&amp;M and Bond Street - are to be produced at the plant.
In conjunction with efforts to boost output, the group has earmarked at
least Dollars 25m for a programme aimed at improving the quality and
quantity of Kazakhstan's tobacco crop.
It is hoped that the country will become self-sufficient in tobacco growing
by 1998.
The acquisition highlights Philip Morris's strategy of broadening the base
of its international tobacco operations, which have experienced healthy
earnings gains recently, in contrast to its US tobacco business, where
operating income has fallen sharply.

FT  28 SEP 93 / International Company News: Paramount may consider higher
offer from QVC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THE board of Paramount Communications, the entertainment group which has
agreed to a takeover from cable company Viacom, said yesterday that it would
consider a higher, hostile offer made by QVC Network when there was
'satisfactory evidence' of financing to support the bid.
The announcement followed a special meeting of the Paramount board to weigh
its options in the takeover battle.
Paramount has insisted that it iscommitted to the deal it announced with
Viacom on September 12. However, Viacom's shares and cash offer is worth far
less than the shares and cash bid launched by QVC on September 20.
Mr Martin Davis, chairman of Paramount, said that the board had taken no
action yesterday on the QVC proposal. 'Paramount will consider the QVC
proposal when there is satisfactory evidence of financing,' he added.
QVC is smaller than Paramount or Viacom and would have to find Dollars
3.55bn to fund the cash portion of its bid. That compares to its annual cash
flow of Dollars 173m.
Wall Street analysts said yesterday's statement gave Paramount some
breathing space, but it acknowledged that the board would have to consider
the offer from QVC, provided that company produced clearer evidence of
financial backing.
Mr Sumner Redstone, chairman of Viacom, announced yesterday that his company
had fully underwritten commitments sufficient to fund its takeover of
Paramount.
In an attempt to sway yesterday's board meeting, Mr Barry Diller, the
chairman of QVC, sent it a letter on Sunday which sought to remove any
concerns about the financing of his offer.
The QVC offer, of Dollars 30 in cash and 0.893 of a share of QVC stock for
each Paramount share, was worth just over Dollars 83 a share, based on QVC's
closing price of Dollars 59 5/8 , down Dollars 1 1/8 . That valued the
company at Dollars 9.8bn. Viacom's bid, which contains Dollars 9.10 a share
in cash, was worth nearly Dollars 67 a share, or Dollars 7.9bn for the
group, on the basis of its closing stock prices. Its A shares stood at
Dollars 62 1/2 , up Dollars 1 5/8 , while its B shares were at Dollars 57
1/4 , up Dollars 1 1/8 .
Paramount closed at Dollars 77 5/8 , up Dollars 2.

FT  28 SEP 93 / International Company News: Carlzon takes flight to
'fortress' - Hugh Carnegy and Paul Betts examine the SAS chief's resignation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY and PAUL BETTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF there were any doubts about Mr Jan Carlzon's commitment to Alcazar, the
ambitious project to merge Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS), KLM Royal
Dutch Airlines, Swissair and Austrian Airlines, the charismatic Swede
dispelled them yesterday.
By announcing his resignation as chief executive of SAS, a position he has
held since 1981, in order to concentrate on Alcazar, Mr Carlzon made it
clear that for him the project, named after a four-towered Moorish fortress,
is a question of all or nothing. 'I have told the board that if Alcazar does
not succeed, I will not remain in this position,' he said.
What he did not say was whether he intended to lead the merged airline
should it happen. His ambition is almost certainly to do so, but he said
only that he would join its senior management. The vision of building a
fourth force in European airlines - after British Airways, Air France and
Lufthansa - out of a handful of the continent's smaller operators is one
that Mr Carlzon has pursued since 1985. But it has become a make-or-break
issue in a career that rose during the 1980s but faltered as the 1990s
brought the airline industry down to earth. Mr Carlzon has been a symbol of
far-sighted Swedish management since he came to SAS at the age of 40 having
transformed the fortunes of a domestic airline, Linjeflyg, through a
low-fares policy.
At SAS, his Global Travel Service System strategy of combining businesses
such as hotels, aircraft servicing and catering with the core airline
service won plaudits. But three and a half years of losses have led SAS to
sell much of its hotel and other non-core investments.
Throughout, Mr Carlzon has roamed Europe and the Americas looking for
partners to give SAS added muscle to battle the US and European groups in an
increasingly deregulated industry. Investments in British Midland and
Continental Airlines of the US, and the European Quality Alliance with
Swissair and Austrian, were among moves which presaged the Alcazar project.
Now, Alcazar is portrayed as a lifeline for SAS, which suffered a SKr609m
(Dollars 77m) loss in the first six months of this year and has not shown a
full-year profit since 1989.
A sign that SAS finds it hard to envisage a future without Alcazar was the
announcement that Mr Jan Reinas, Mr Carlzon's successor as chief executive,
would leave the company in April to take up an appointment at Norske Skog,
the Norwegian pulp and paper group.
Alcazar is still not a foregone conclusion. The intention to produce by last
June a memorandum of understanding outlining how the four airlines will be
moulded under one management slipped to September.
Mr Carlzon said he hoped the MoU would be completed by October, but would
not give guarantees. KLM and Swissair confirmed that the mid-September
deadline had been moved into October. For its part, Austrian, the smallest
of the gang of four, said it was still considering an alternative option to
co-operate with Lufthansa rather than join the Alcazar partnership.
From the outset, none of the four airlines expected the negotiations to be
straightforward and many in the industry felt the timetable for formal
agreement by the end of this year was optimistic.
Although the airlines remain convinced that a partnership can significantly
strengthen their competitive position, several complex issues still need to
be ironed out.
These include:
The relative financial share of the airlines. One official close to the
talks yesterday said progress had been made within the proposed framework of
a 30 per cent share each for SAS, KLM and Swissair and 10 per cent for
Austrian, but agreement was not complete.
The Swiss financial community has expressed concern that this structure
would undervalue Swissair.
The participation of Austrian Airlines remains uncertain. Indeed, there are
strong indications that the Austrian carrier is leaning towards Lufthansa,
which has a stake in Lauda Air, the other Austrian airline.
Austrian yesterday confirmed that it had yet to make up its mind. But, even
if Austrian were to opt for co-operation with Lufthansa, KLM, SAS and
Swissair are still expected to continue seeking a merger of the three
instead of four airlines.
The location of the headquarters is proving another thorny question because
of the strategic and national implications of the ultimate decision. The
candidates include Amsterdam, Zurich, Copenhagen, or Vienna (if Austrian
agrees to join the venture).
Amsterdam seems the frontrunner because of its strategic position and the
advantages the partners would gain from the 'open skies' agreement between
the Netherlands and the US.
However, SAS is likely to make a strong pitch for Copenhagen, which it has
developed successfully into its main international hub.
The management question of who will be first among equals among the
four-strong top management team. Even though the partners claim to share a
common vision and have co-operated through the so-called European Quality
Alliance marketing partnership, the composition of the joint management team
remains a problem.
Coupled with the management problem is the reaction of the powerful airline
unions in each country, which fear job cuts.
The selection of a US airline partner. KLM has close links with Northwest;
Swissair with Delta, and SAS has had a long association with Continental.
Any of these issues could undermine Mr Carlzon's vision of creating a
European fortress airline. His decision to resign as SAS chief executive to
devote his time to the Alcazar project suggests that the construction of the
fortress still remains in the balance.

FT  28 SEP 93 / International Company News: Cerus trims losses to FFr97m
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
CERUS, the French holding company controlled by Mr Carlo de Benedetti, the
Italian industrialist, managed to trim its net losses to FFr97m (Dollars
16.7m) in the first half of 1993 from FFr377m in the same period in 1992.
This was mainly due to a cut in the deficit of Banque Dumenil Leble, its
banking subsidiary.
The problems of Banque Dumenil, which has been affected by the difficulties
of its Swiss branch and turmoil in the French money markets, have clouded
Cerus for two years.
However, Cerus raised FFr1.4bn during the first half by selling its 3.1 per
cent stake in Suez, the French industrial and financial holding company. The
proceeds of the sale were used to finance a FFr1.3bn recapitalisation of
Banque Dumenil and to reduce Cerus's net debt.
The recapitalisation, which resulted in Cerus taking full control of Banque
Dumenil, helped the latter reduce its interim net loss to FFr39m in the
first six months of this year from FFr374m at the same stage of 1992 .
The other main French investment held by Cerus, which is 49 per cent owned
by Mr de Benedetti through CIR, his holding company, is a 35.4 per cent
stake in Valeo, the car parts group.

FT  28 SEP 93 / International Company News: Traub buys east German
machine-tool group

<TEXT>
THE Treuhand, the agency charged with privatising the eastern German
economy, yesterday sold Heckert, the region's oldest machine-tool
manufacturers, to Traub, one of western Germany's largest manufacturers of
tools.
The price was not disclosed.
The sale of Heckert, based in Chemnitz, Saxony, will give Traub a foothold
in eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, a region which accounted for
more than 70 per cent of Heckert's turnover before German reunification.
Mr Hans Dieter Potsch, chief executive of Stuttgart-based Traub, said the
group would invest more than DM60m (Dollars 37m) in Heckert over the next
four years and would guarantee about 500 jobs.
Before 1989, the plant employed 4,500. Last year, it recorded losses of over
DM59m, compared with DM29m in 1991. Consolidated turnover fell by 11 per
cent to DM339m over the same period.
However, Mr Potsch said he was confident of growth over the next few years.
