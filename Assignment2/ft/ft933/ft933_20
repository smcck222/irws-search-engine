FT  27 AUG 93 / Safety warning on privatised railway
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RACHEL JOHNSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE frequency and severity of railway accidents could increase unless
adequate safety controls are implemented after privatisation, the Health and
Safety Commission warned yesterday.
Sir John Cullen, commission chairman, told possible franchise-seekers -
including Stagecoach and British Rail managers - that there were 'clear
safety implications'.
New companies with 'little or no experience' of operating the railways could
enter the industry. 'They may have staff with limited experience of railway
safety,' he warned.
The commission has acknowledged the danger inherent in removing
responsibility for the railways from one experienced body and giving it to a
multitude of possibly inexperienced new companies.
After privatisation, operators would have to produce 'safety cases'
demonstrating that they had identified risks; established patterns of
responsibility for control; and could manage operations without letting
safety standards slip.

FT  27 AUG 93 / Growth may outstrip forecast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S economic growth this year is likely to be a 'little stronger' than
the 1.25 per cent forecast at the time of the March Budget. In addition,
underlying inflation might be a little lower than the 3.75 per cent
originally expected for the fourth quarter of this year, the Treasury
reported yesterday.
Delivering a cautiously upbeat assessment of the economy, the Treasury said
that developments in the first half of this year - with renewed growth in
activity, an improving labour market, low inflation and a sound trade
performance - were 'encouraging for the prospect of a period of sustained
economic growth in the years ahead'.
The Treasury's latest bulletin marked a further small step in the direction
of greater openness. It provided a rudimentary update of the government's
economic forecast ahead of publication of the next official forecast with
the November 30 Budget. But it did not provide the figures that make up the
government's forward look of economic prospects and failed to draw any
policy conclusions.
The Treasury cautioned that the recovery was in its early days and that it
was too soon to be sure how it will develop. Latest figures suggested that
gross domestic product rose  3/4 per cent between the second half of last
year and the first half of 1993 and therefore 'significantly faster' than
the Budget forecast of  1/4 per cent growth.
This could have been due to temporary factors such as heavy price
discounting. Downside risks existed such as the high level of personal
sector debt and the weak state of the continental European economies. 'We
cannot yet conclude that the faster than expected pace of growth will
necessarily continue,' the Treasury said.
The bulletin took a similarly cautious view of the 80,000 fall in
unemployment so far this year, pointing out that it might represent a once
and for all compensation for excess sackings last autumn when business
confidence slumped after sterling's exit from the European exchange rate
mechanism.
The Treasury said it was still premature to state unequivocally that the
peak of unemployment had passed.
Although it said inflationary pressures were 'very subdued', there might be
some nasty surprises ahead. Following sterling's devaluation, further
increases in input prices may still have to feed through into retail price
inflation. The Treasury therefore still expects some pick-up in underlying
inflation from July's 2.9 per cent annual rate.
However, the Treasury took a bullish view of the UK's competitive position.
Although information on trade was patchy, 'it seems more likely than not
that net trade made a positive contribution to GDP growth in the first half
of the year', it said.
Industrial surveys are generally more up to date than official data, the
Treasury said yesterday in another paper. Anecdotal surveys such as those
published by the Confederation of British Industry, the Institute of
Directors and Dun &amp; Bradstreet, the business information group, provided
useful information on the current state and trends in the economy and made
an important contribution to the forecasting process.

FT  27 AUG 93 / Upbeat view tempered by investment warning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CONFEDERATION of British Industry yesterday raised its forecast of
economic growth in Britain this year and next, but warned that sluggish
investment and persistent current account and budget deficits could still
upset recovery.
The employers' group now expects that gross domestic product will increase
by a real 1.7 per cent this year, after a 0.4 per cent decline last year,
with growth accelerating to 3 per cent next year.
This is in line with the most recent consensus forecast for UK economic
growth this year, as measured by Consensus Economics, a consultancy. But the
CBI is taking a more bullish view than the forecasters' average growth
projection of 2.6 per cent for 1994.
Its previous CBI forecast, published in May, predicted growth of 1.6 per
cent this year and 2.6 per cent next year.
Mr Andrew Sentance, CBI's director of economic affairs, said stronger
consumer demand had prompted the upward revision of this year's forecast and
this was offsetting the negative impact of slower growth in continental
Europe.
In its latest forecast, the CBI predicted:
Continued strong manufacturing output, up 3.3 per cent this year and 3.5 per
cent in 1994.
Consumer spending rising 1.8 per cent this year and 2.3 per cent next year.
Exports of goods and services rising by about 5 per cent in volume this year
and next.
Company profits rising by a real 9.4 per cent this year and 4.1 per cent
next year after declines of 4.7 per cent and 3.6 per cent respectively in
1991 and 1992.
Continuing low inflation, with the underlying rate (excluding mortgage
interest rates) little changed at around 3 per cent at the end of next year
and the 'headline' rate, including mortgages, rising to 3.3 per cent by the
end of 1994 from below 1.5 per cent at present.
The group said it was concerned that investment would lag the recovery,
rising by just 0.6 per cent across the whole economy this year and 1.7 per
cent in 1994.
Although manufacturing investment is forecast to rise over the second part
of this year, its average level over the whole year is still expected to be
1.4 per cent below last year's level. Even if investment grows as projected
by 2.5 per cent, it will still be 11 per cent below the 1990 level.
The CBI expects short-term interest rates to fall to 5 per cent from 6 per
cent by the end of this year but then rise to 5.5 per cent by the end of
1994.

FT  27 AUG 93 / Recession less deep than reported, figures show
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE recent recession was slightly less deep than previously reported,
according to revised official statistics released yesterday.
The Central Statistical Office said that the economy contracted by 0.4 per
cent last year, compared with its earlier reports of a 0.5 per cent decline,
and put the real, inflation-adjusted, fall of gross domestic product in 1991
at 2.3 per cent, compared with 2.5 per cent previously.
The growth figures, released ahead of next month's publication of the CSO
Blue Book giving the national accounts for last year took 1990 prices as a
base level instead of 1985 prices as previously.
They also took into account a reweighting of certain items in the national
output figures. The government says that oil and gas extraction now
represent only 1.7 per cent of UK economic output in value compared with 6.2
per cent previously, reflecting the sharp fall in oil prices after 1986.
Banking and other financial services have been reduced in importance to 3.9
per cent and 1.5 per cent of output from 5.5 per cent and 3.3 per cent
respectively. The shares of wholesale and distribution services have risen
to 2.2 per cent and medical and health services to 4.5 per cent from 1.3 per
cent and 3.6 per cent.
The Blue Book will contain a 'national balance sheet' for the first time in
six years, reflecting improvements in the CSO's gathering of statistics.
Among the statistics published yesterday were figures pointing to a
strengthening of household savings that could be a reaction to falling
wealth levels. The figures showed:
A sharp fall of 3.6 per cent in national wealth, measured by total tangible
assets, to Pounds 2,418bn last year. Last year's decline reflected falling
property values and was the third annual fall in succession. Officials said
the three-year decline was unprecedented since the government first began to
measure such assets in the 1950s.
A big jump in household savings to Pounds 17.85bn at current prices last
year from Pounds 5bn the year before. The savings, which excluded payments
to life assurance policies and pension funds, amounted to 4.1 per cent of
household disposable income, the highest level since records began in 1970.
Between 1986 and 1990, households borrowed rather than saved, with overall
borrowings reaching a peak of Pounds 10.8bn in 1989.
The balance sheet for last year also disclosed that the UK's overall savings
ratio rose to 12.5 per cent of personal disposable income last year, up 2.4
percentage points on 1991 and the highest level since the end of the 1950s.

Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health secretary, said: 'The need to reduce public

organisations are to be deregulated. Mrs Tessa Baring, who chairs the

on suggested changes 'early in the new year'.
Mr Neil Hamilton, the trade and industry minister responsible for
deregulation, said the team would 'look at the whole range of regulations
affecting the voluntary sector, and will also bring a different perspective
to concerns about unnecessary regulations'.
It will work closely with Lord Sainsbury, special adviser on deregulation to
Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary.
One step towards deregulation in the sector came yesterday with the first
publication of the decisions and advice of the Charity Commissioners. These
will now be published twice a year.

FT  27 AUG 93 / Hoover wins Pounds 1m Scottish sweetener
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GLASGOW Development Agency confirmed yesterday that it had made a
contractual agreement worth around Pounds 1m with Hoover for the transfer of
its manufacturing output from Dijon in France to Cambuslang, near Glasgow,
creating a further 400 jobs at the plant, Robert Taylor writes.
Last winter's announcement of the move to Cambuslang provoked accusations in
France that the move was in conflict with European Community regulations.
The matter is under investigation by the European Commission.
Mr Lew Scott, Hoover's vice-president of manufacturing, said yesterday the
agreement had been 'one of a number of key factors in giving our parent
company the confidence to commit itself to the consolidation of production
at Cambuslang'.
Hoover has agreed to maintain the expanded level of employment at the plant.
It will repay in full or in part the financial support from the agency if
employment falls below an undisclosed figure over the next five to 10 years.
The agency, a joint private-sector and public-sector enterprise, said its
aim had been to secure the existing total of nearly 1,000 jobs at the plant
and ensure Cambuslang could provide 'production facilities of sufficient
quality to support the company's longer-term competitive position'.

FT  27 AUG 93 / Engineering orders look 'uncertain and fragile'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SALES and orders figures for the UK engineering industry in the second
quarter of the year show little change on the first quarter, reflecting weak
home demand and sustained but fragile export growth.
Figures from the Central Statistical Office, released yesterday, showed
sales for the industry up by half of 1 per cent on the first quarter at
constant 1985 prices seasonally adjusted with export sales up 4 per cent and
home sales down 2 per cent. Net new orders dropped by half of 1 per cent on
the previous quarter.
In comparison with the second quarter of last year, sales and net new orders
remain sharply up, with sales 6 per cent ahead and orders 7 per cent ahead.
Total orders for the industry at the end of June were down 1.5 per cent on
the first quarter, but up 2 per cent on the figure for June 1992.
Export growth was particularly strong in the electronics sector, with
mechanical engineering sales growing less fast.
At current prices, electrical and instrument engineering sales were Pounds
10.3bn in the second quarter, 12 per cent up on the same quarter last year.
By contrast, mechanical engineering sales were Pounds 7.7bn, only 2 per cent
up.
Electrical and instrument engineering orders-on-hand were worth Pounds
19.9bn for the second quarter, against Pounds 19.2bn for the second period
of 1992. Mechanical engineering orders-on-hand were down from Pounds 11.8bn
to Pounds 11.6bn over the same period, although new orders were up from
Pounds 7.6bn to Pounds 7.8bn.
Mr Ian Thompson, economic adviser to the Engineering Employers' Federation,
said: 'The trend is generally upwards, but it is very uncertain and fragile;
our major export market is western Europe, but that market is by no means
secure.'
The electronics sector is continuing to benefit from the surge of sales at
the end of last year, although it points to evidence of sales slowing in the
motor vehicles sector.

FT  27 AUG 93 / 'Sinister' food stores attacked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NURDIN &amp; Peacock, the cash-and-carry operator, yesterday accused the biggest
supermarket chains of a 'sinister' attempt to 'strangle at birth' its plans
to open US-style cut-price warehouse clubs in the UK.
N&amp;P is constructing a warehouse club - a large shed selling goods at very
low prices to card-carrying members - at Wednesbury, in the west Midlands.
Sainsbury, Tesco and Safeway are trying to overturn the 'general use'
planning permission granted to the club. They argue it should have been
classed as a retailer and only given permission to build on designated
retail land, which is several times more expensive.
They have taken the unprecedented step of employing joint legal advisers,
planning specialists and a public relations agency to put their case.
They are also attempting to overturn planning permission granted to US
company Costco to build a warehouse club at Thurrock, Essex.
Mr David Poole, N&amp;P's managing director, said the supermarket chains were
trying to 'strangle us at birth'.
He added: 'There is something sinister about three companies who have 40 per
cent of the retail food market with combined sales of Pounds 20bn and who
spend up to Pounds 2bn a year on new sites, getting together to thwart a
business that has not even opened yet.'
A spokesman for the three chains said the allegations were 'sensationalist
and not borne out by the facts'.

FT  27 AUG 93 / Return to speculative property deals seen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE commercial property industry is planning a return to speculative
property development, a survey has found.
The study, carried out by Gallup, found that 36 per cent of large property
companies and institutional investors are planning to spend up to Pounds 2bn
on speculative developments over the next two years.
Industrial property is the most popular sector, with London and the
south-east the most popular regions for developers, followed by the
Midlands.
Insurance companies appeared to be the most enthusiastic about the prospects
for speculative development, while pension funds were more cautious.
The findings reflect an upturn in confidence over the past six months.
However, many in the industry doubt there will be a large-scale return to
speculative development until there is greater evidence of renewed demand
from tenants. The survey of large pension funds, insurance companies and
property companies was commissioned by CSW, a property magazine.
The survey found that the property industry's overall confidence was little
changed over the last quarter, following a sharp rise from last October.
Just 1 per cent of respondents expect the UK property market to get worse
over the next year. Six per cent expect it to stay the same, while 82 per
cent expect it to 'get a little better'.

FT  27 AUG 93 / Union concern after roof collapses at another pit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SECTION of roof supported by roof bolts at Ellington Colliery,
Northumberland, collapsed earlier this week, British Coal confirmed
yesterday.
There was 'no comparison' between Tuesday's fall and last week's accident at
Bilsthorpe Colliery, Nottingham, in which a roof supported by bolts
collapsed, killing three men, British Coal added.
Nobody was injured in the Ellington incident, 1,000 feet down and six miles
out under the North Sea, in a fenced off area abandoned in May due to poor
geological conditions.
Mr Ian Lavery, Ellington branch secretary for the National Union of
Mineworkers, said the incident had heightened concern already voiced by
Ellington miners at the increasing use of roof bolts as a means of support.
'We fear for the safety of the members,' said Mr Lavery. 'We're not
convinced roof bolts are safe.' He called for an independent inquiry into
Tuesday's incident. Mr Alan Beith, Liberal Democrat MP for Berwick who
visited the colliery yesterday, urged a rigorous investigation.
At a meeting today with Mr Tom Watson, pit manager, arranged before
Tuesday's fall, the union will urge British Coal not to extend the use of
roof bolts at Ellington.
British Coal yesterday insisted the roof fall would probably have occured
with traditional arched girders. It was pointless to install girders and
they would not waste materials on an abandoned and sealed area.
Men were working 100 yards from the disused Number Three roadway when a 45
foot long, 12 foot thick roof section of rock and coal crashed down. Mr
Lavery said Ellington miners were still working in another area where roof
bolts were the main support but were concerned about the situation.

FT  27 AUG 93 / Treasury urges rigorous line on spending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Treasury yesterday issued a stern warning that government spending
'could all too easily' outstrip growth in the economy.
It said a rigorous approach to planning and management was required to
prevent strong pressures for extra spending threatening the government's
policy objectives of reducing total public spending as a share of gross
domestic product, cutting taxes 'over time', and bringing the government's
Pounds 50bn annual fiscal deficit back towards balance over the medium term.
An article published in the latest and final edition of the Treasury
Bulletin warned that policy initiatives and influences that had resulted in
significant reductions in the ratio of general government expenditure to GDP
in the 1980s no longer had a big impact.
More significant was the sharp rise of 3 per cent a year in general
government expenditure since 1988-89. This acceleration of spending across
programmes 'clearly cannot be sustained' if government spending is to fall
as a share of national output, it said.
The article by a senior Treasury official fleshed out concerns expressed by
Mr Michael Portillo, the chief secretary to the Treasury and cabinet
minister responsible for controlling public spending. It underlined why the
government has committed itself to firm limits on the growth of spending and
why it has launched a rolling programme of root-and-branch reviews
questioning the spending programmes of big government departments.
The Treasury stressed that the recent sharp rise in public spending mirrored
structural as well as cyclical increases that reflected rising expectations
and demand for public services.
It warned of a number of strong pressures on programmes, which if not
checked or offset by action elsewhere, would push public spending higher and
threaten the government's main policy goals.
These pressures include: Debt interest which is expected to grow at about 9
per cent a year in real terms over the next four years.
Invalidity and disability benefit payments, housing benefits, the cost of
lone parents and demographic change which were pushing underlining social
security spending up by more than 3 per cent a year in real terms.
Continuing demands on the health, personal social services and law and order
programmes.
Bunching of large expenditure projects, especially in transport.
The Treasury's long-term plans, published in its March Budget, envisage a
gradual fall in the share of general government expenditure - excluding
privatisation proceeds - as a percentage of GDP to 43.5 per cent in 1997-98
from a forecast peak of 45.5 per cent in the coming 1994-95 financial year.
Before the recent recession, this so-called GGE ratio had declined from a
peak of 47.5 per cent of GDP in 1982-83 to 39.25 per cent in 1988-89.

FT  27 AUG 93 / TUC plans union subscription drive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The TUC is planning a nationwide campaign urging an estimated 6m workers to
remain union members and to carry on paying their subscriptions.
Mr John Monks, who will become TUC general secretary in a fortnight, said
the aim was to contact every union member. The move is in response to the
Trade Union Reform and Employment Rights Act which comes into force on
Monday.
Employers will only be able to deduct union subscriptions from a worker's
wages under the check-off system if the worker agrees every three years in
writing.
The law will oblige employers to notify the workers of this as well as of
any increase in union subscriptions and also to remind workers that they can
withdraw authorisation for check-off at any time.

FT  27 AUG 93 / US airline chief calls for progress on route talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE British and US governments were urged yesterday to advance their
negotiations on the liberalisation of air routes to pave the way for broader
multilateral talks in future involving other members of the European
Community.
Mr Stephen Wolf, the chairman of United Airlines, visiting London yesterday,
indicated that the talks had been given fresh impetus by the publication
last week of the report into the US aviation industry commissioned by
President Bill Clinton.
One of the report's recommendations was that foreign airlines should be able
to raise their voting stakes in US companies to 49 per cent on condition
that this was reciprocated to US companies. At present foreign airlines
cannot exceed a voting stake of 25 per cent.
Mr Wolf said that he welcomed the recommendations even though he thought
that, in practise, they would be less beneficial to US operators because of
EC restrictions on foreign-owned carriers running routes in the community.
But the report had given scope for building blocks to a new US/UK agreement
and broader negotiations in future.
Mr Wolf said he could not understand why both governments had declared that
they wanted greater liberalisation, yet so far had agreed nothing. 'It's
like two drunks singing the same lyrics all the time, but they can't get on
the same melody,' he said.
The need for greater liberalisation has been given greater urgency by
British Airways' stake-building in USAir. BA now has 24.5 per cent of the
equity and 21.5 per cent of the voting rights in USAir.

FT  27 AUG 93 / Patten rejects fears of university shortages
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE number of school leavers unable to find university places is likely to
be much lower than feared, Mr John Patten, the education secretary, forecast
yesterday.
Mr Patten, who has returned to work after a six-week illness, said the
outlook was 'going to be nothing like as gloomy as some people have
predicted'.
Commentators have suggested that thousands of students will fail to win
places on arts courses because of a 30 per cent cut imposed by the
government in tuition funding
Mr Patten said many universities still had vacancies on arts courses,
including English places at 27 universities and geography at 26
universities. He also advised students to consider attending one of the 350
colleges of further education, 131 of which offered degree courses.
He defended the funding cut, which was intended to encourage students to
switch from arts to science courses. Speaking on BBC radio he said: 'Can we
afford to be a country which has too few people going into science? That
strikes me as the major problem at the moment.'
He was concerned that only 64,000 students took mathematics at A-level - the
main examination for 18-year-olds in England, Wales and Northern Ireland -
this year, compared to 82,000 in 1989. Only 34,000 took physics at A-level,
compared to 47,000 in 1989. Mr Patten said: 'That is a pretty substantial
problem. It's not purely a political problem, it is a marketing problem -
trying to persuade children that science is interesting and rewarding.'
He rejected suggestions that his political credibility had been damaged by a
series of retreats on policy issues following protests from teachers. He
said his strategy had received full support in the recent report by Sir Ron
Dearing, who heads the government's review of the national curriculum.
Following the report the government abandoned detailed curriculums for most
subjects and withdrew plans to publish league tables of schools based on
pupils' performance.
Mr Patten congratulated pupils and teachers on a record number of high
grades in GCSE passes - in contrast to his suggestion last year that
improved results were a reflection of lower standards.
Examination results released yesterday showed that more than half the 5m
entrants in England, Wales and Northern Ireland achieved A, B or C grades.
The percentage of these grades - the equivalent of the former O-level pass -
rose by 1.1 per cent to 52.4 per cent.
Mr Patten said pupils and teachers could 'take particular pride in the fact
that this year's papers have been marked against the much more stringent
standards laid down in the code of practice for the examining boards which I
announced last January'.

FT  27 AUG 93 / Names angry as underwriters continue to trade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Lloyd's insurance market was criticised yesterday for allowing
underwriters of two of the heaviest lossmaking catastrophe reinsurance
syndicates to continue trading as active members.
Mr Patrick Fagan and Mr Derek Walker are listed as Lloyd's Names - the
individuals whose wealth supports the market - in the latest edition of the
Lloyd's blue book, the publication that details Names' syndicate
participations.
'Members who have been ruined by their activities will find it galling in
the extreme that those responsible for their misfortunes can still attempt
to trade out of their difficulties,' says an article in the newsletter
published by the Association of Lloyd's Members, which represents some 9,000
Lloyd's Names.
According to the 1993 blue book Mr Walker is a Name on 18 separate Lloyd's
syndicates, while Mr Fagan is backing 11 separate syndicates. Names must
show wealth of at least Pounds 250,000 to trade at the market.
Both men resigned active participation as underwriters after their own
syndicates crashed in 1990 and 1991.
Mr Walker is also a leading figure in the Gooda Walker agency, whose affairs
are being investigated by the Serious Fraud Office.
Both are thought to have made heavy losses as a result of participation in
their own syndicates, but will hope to make profits this year as rises in
insurance rates revive prospects for profitability.
The association says that underwriters of syndicates whose losses exceed 150
per cent of their capacity - the amount of premiums that syndicates are
allowed to accept - should be suspended. Lloyd's said yesterday that it was
unable to suspend Names for reasons of natural justice.

FT  27 AUG 93 / Inquiry urged into in-store credit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR yesterday called for the Office of Fair Trading to set up an inquiry
into in-store credit cards after a survey by party researchers found
interest rates as high as 34.4 per cent.
Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary, said the average
interest rate was 27 per cent - more than four times higher than the base
lending rate at most banks.
Mr Cook said Marks and Spencer was the only store which had reduced interest
charges in line with the fall of 9 percentage points in bank base rates
since September last year.
He added: 'Some stores must be making a bigger profit out of their excessive
interest rates than out of selling their goods.'
Ms Elizabeth Stanton, director of the Retail Credit Group, which represents
most of the large stores, said interest charges reflected processing costs
which were higher than those incurred by bank credit cards.

FT  27 AUG 93 / Lib Dems to push policies on crime
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Liberal Democrats are to use their conference next month to stake their
claim as the party able to tackle crime effectively, aiming to reinforce
their appeal to disaffected Conservative supporters.
Although the conference takes place against a background of impressive
recent by-election successes, hopes of a trouble-free occasion may be
hindered by a split among its policymakers over uprating the state pension.
The high-profile initiative on crime, which will include a party political
broadcast, an eve-of-conference rally and two conference debates, will be
spearheaded by Mr Robert Maclennan, home affairs spokesman, and Mr David
Alton, MP for Mossley Hill.
But Mr Alton's appointment offers some ammunition to the party's opponents,
since he was the subject of dismissive comments from Mr Paddy Ashdown,
Liberal Democrat leader, at last September's conference.
Mr Alton threatened to leave the party over its policy on abortion. Mr
Ashdown replied that: 'His departure, though sad, will not in any way alter
the effectiveness of our party or our capacity to put our message across.'
Launching the conference agenda yesterday, Mr Charles Kennedy, Liberal
Democrat president, emphasised that Mr Alton had been reconciled with his
colleagues.
The prospect of a clash over pension policy appears less easily resolved.
The motion from the party's policy committee proposes a shift away from the
general election manifesto commitment to uprate the basic state pension in
line with earnings, in favour of uprating it in line with prices, together
with extra help for those most in need.
An amendment tabled by Mr Archy Kirkwood, the party's social security
spokesman, however, favours keeping the uprating link with earnings, and
meeting the cost from income tax.

TALKS on rescuing the proposed regional jet joint venture between British
Aerospace and Taiwan Aerospace Corporation (TAC) yesterday splintered into a
series of meetings largely among Taiwanese officials over the details of a
draft deal.
Mr Denny Ko, TAC's president, was hopeful of agreement on the financial
structure 'within 24 hours'.
A team led by Mr John Cahill, BAe's chairman, has been in talks with
Taiwanese bankers, politicians and industrialists since Monday.
The joint venture, Avro, is central to his strategy to improve BAe's
profitability. The RJ series of regional jets that it would build partly in
Taiwan currently loses money.
A contract establishing the joint venture was signed last January, but
Taiwanese banks lending money to Avro expressed fears last month that it was
too risky.
The latest round of talks involved lawyers, the state-owned Chiao Tung Bank,
which leads the consortium of lender banks, the Ministry of Economic
Affairs, Taiwan's industry ministry, and other government departments.
Mr Ko also held meetings with Taiwan's defence ministry to discuss what part
of the RJ programme could be most easily transferred to Taiwan.
The defence ministry's Aero Industry Development Centre (AIDC) would be
involved in RJ assembly and the development of any new aircraft, called the
RJ-X.
Major General Shin You-kwon, who heads the assembly of Taiwan's
home-produced supersonic fighter aircraft, stressed the significance of
winning RJ-X work.
'This project would bring real benefit in learning design and manufacture
(of civil aircraft),' he said.
The government wants to encourage the aerospace industry to diversify away
from the defence sector.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   WELLINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NEW ZEALAND is to allow competition in the export of meat to Europe, ending
30 years of dominance of the Dollars 150m-Dollars 180m annual trade by the
British-led Conference Lines.
The decision will particularly affect P &amp; O, which dominates the Conference
Lines. Its 44,000 tonne container ships, specially developed for the trade,
will not be able to use the smaller ports that expect to handle export meat
to Europe. There will be far-reaching consequences also for New Zealand's
four leading container ports, as well as the railways and road hauliers.
The government aims to encourage ships to call at the ports nearest to
processing plants, rather than fill containers and send them by rail or road
to cities such as Auckland, now the biggest exporter of meat with 171,000
tonnes annually.
Mr Brian Lynch of the Meat Industry Association hailed the decision as 'the
biggest breath of fresh air to hit the industry for over 30 years.'

FT  27 AUG 93 / World Trade News: US lifts computer export curbs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE and LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON, SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US Commerce Department yesterday announced a liberalisation of export
restrictions on a wide range of computer equipments sold to former communist
countries and to China.
The changes cover all computers with performance up to 67m theoretical
operations per second (67 MTOPS). This includes the latest PCs powered by
Intel's new Pentium microprocessor, many computer work-stations including
most of those produced by Sun Microsystems, and much of IBM's product line,
excluding high-performance mainframe computers and work-stations.
For US computer manufacturers, the loosening of export regulations will much
reduce delays and paperwork in export sales to countries such as China and
those of eastern Europe.
This development provides 'significant interim relief' from export
restrictions, said Intel, leading manufacturer of microprocessors used in
PCs.
IBM called the changes a 'positive move in light of the high potential
demand for our products, especially in China'.
However, the Clinton administration is already considering an even broader
liberalisation 'in a very short period of time', said Mr Steven Goldman,
head of the Commerce Department's Office of Foreign Availability.
He said higher-performance computers may soon be widely available from
countries with no export restrictions. His office cannot make
recommendations based on prospective availability, but the administration
may take that into consideration and act soon on more powerful computer
equipment.
The US will also seek removal of the equivalent export licensing
requirements by allies in the Co-ordinating Committee on Multilateral Export
Controls (Cocom). US allies are usually much more prone to liberalisation so
Cocom is unlikely to object.
Mr Barry Carter, acting under-secretary of commerce, said the liberalisation
'will significantly improve marketing opportunities for US computer
companies, making them more competitive abroad without impairing US national
security'.
Licences will no longer be required for sales of computers to Russia,
Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia, as well as China and other
communist countries. The US will continue controls, for foreign policy
reasons, to Iraq and Iran, among others.
The Commerce Department acted on a claim from the American Electronics
Association that comparable computers could be obtained from countries
without export controls.
The AEA wanted decontrol of much more sophisticated equipment with
capabilities up to 210 MTOPS, including high-performance mainframe computers
and some supercomputers.

FT  27 AUG 93 / World Trade News: Mobile phone contracts won in Hungary

US WEST, the US regional telecommunications company, has strengthened its
leading position in eastern Europe's thriving mobile communications business
by winning one of two concessions awarded yesterday by Hungary to run
digital cordless services.
The second of the fiercely contested licences was awarded unexpectedly to
Pannon GSM, a consortium of national operators from the Netherlands,
Denmark, Sweden and Finland.
US West has recently won tenders to develop digital mobile networks in 10
Russian cities and to help operate analogue networks in the Czech Republic
and Slovakia.
Its existing joint venture with the Hungarian Telecommunications Company
(HTC), the state-owned national operator, providing an analogue mobile
telecommunications service in Hungary, already has 33,000 subscribers after
just three years of operation.
Pannon GSM squeezed out the DBFH Consortium, a powerful coalition of
Deutsche Bundespost Telekom, British Telecom and France Telecom, for the
second licence.
It originally topped the bidding with an offer of Dollars 48m, against
Dollars 46m by the US West consortium. But Pannon GSM, previously
third-placed with a submission of Dollars 45m, is understood to have raised
its bid at the last minute to Dollars 50m.
Senior German, British and French diplomats intervened vainly yesterday with
the Hungarian prime minister's office on behalf of DBFH, which later
threatened 'further steps'.
Competition between the three leading contenders was fierce because there is
tremendous suppressed demand for telephones in eastern Europe and the mobile
communications market has shrugged off regionwide recession.
Hungary is the most developed market for cellular services and the first
east European country to grant licences for digital systems using the
pan-European GSM standard.
The Hungarian authorities' desire to promote competition in
telecommunications may have contributed to DBFH's defeat. Bids are due in
October for a stake of more than 30 per cent in HTC. Deutsche Telekom, as
well as being leader of the DBFH consortium, will be a prime contender.

FT  27 AUG 93 / World Trade News: Strong yen goes shopping abroad - Renewed
exporting of Japanese production
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO and VICTOR MALLET
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RECENT sharp rise of the yen is forcing Japanese manufacturers to make
plans to move still more of their production to low-cost factories overseas,
which is delighting investment promotion agencies in the rest of Asia.
Japanese companies have been shifting production to other Asian countries
since the yen began to strengthen in the mid-1980s. The depressed state of
Japan's domestic economy has slowed the pace of new investment in south-east
Asia in the past few years.
That slowdown is now likely to be reversed, Japanese and south-east Asian
companies say, both because Japanese manufacturers are suffering from the
strong yen and because Asia is the most promising growth market for consumer
goods.
'The situation is similar to events in 1984,' said Mr Tarrin
Nimmanahaeminda, the Thai finance minister, predicting increased investment
and employment by Japanese companies.
The new investment is likely to come in two forms: multinationals with
existing foreign operations will expand those facilities, and smaller and
medium-sized companies will probably join the exodus from their high-cost
home base.
In Thailand, for instance, Toyota is spending some Dollars 570m to double
its capacity to around 200,000 vehicles a year and improve its distribution
network; Toshiba, which has had a television tube factory in Thailand since
1990, is increasing production by 70 per cent; and Oki Electric is doubling
the size of its Thailand factory and adding image drums for printers to the
products already produced there.
Japanese plants assembling cars and electronic goods in countries such as
Thailand and Indonesia are expected to be joined by a growing number of
components suppliers.
'I'm sure that many, many companies at present in Japan will come abroad,
especially to the south-east Asian area,' Mr Kikuji Tateichi, head of the
Japan external trade organisation (Jetro) office in Bangkok, said.
Not every Japanese company has the will or the means to move its operations
abroad, and many local south-east Asian manufacturers are expected to
benefit from the strong yen as more and more Japanese companies source their
components from foreign suppliers.
'Some Japanese companies are converting their source of supply of
components, for example from Japan to south-east Asian countries such as
Malaysia or Singapore,' said Mr Tateichi.
Mr Richard Han, president and chief executive of the Thai company Hana
Microelectronics, has already noticed increasing interest from his Japanese
clients, although he expects prospective new customers to move cautiously
rather than 'rush and sub-contract everything the next day'.
Hana, employing 900 people, assembles semiconductors and printed circuit
boards. Although some of the company's inputs are imported from Japan, its
biggest cost is machinery (much of it American) and it has the advantage of
relatively cheap Thai labour.
If Japanese companies suffering from the yen do not find it worthwhile to
move abroad, 'subcontractors like myself are perhaps fortuitously in a
position to reap some of the benefit,' says Mr Han.
Even when there is a shift of manufacturing from Japan to other Asian
countries, it is not being made across the board. Japanese companies are
keeping production of more value-added products strictly at home.
Mitsubishi Electric, for example, is moving production of mass-market
products such as video cassette recorders overseas, but is keeping factory
capacity in Japan free to produce high-definition televisions for when
market demand grows.
Japanese executives say that the high level of technological skills required
to manufacture leading-edge products means these will have to be kept in
Japan for some time.
The picture that emerges is of an increasingly clear division of labour
between Japan and the rest of Asia.
Mr Masaru Takagi, chief economist at Fuji Research Institute, believes this
separation of roles will not be limited to mass-market products sold
overseas but will increasingly extend to those aimed at the Japanese market
as well.
While Japanese car-makers are currently exporting mass-market cars to Asia,
Mr Takagi sees the reverse happening in the future.
The recent strengthening of the yen is not always good news for Asian
countries and companies outside Japan, particularly those - such as
Indonesia - with substantial yen loans to repay.
However, as Japan starts to rely on imports for high-volume products and
shifts its exports to low-volume, value-added goods, the trade balance is
expected to alter.
'Japan's trade surplus with Asia will shrink,' Mr Takagi says, 'and in the
long run, a trade deficit with the region is not out of the question.'

pipeline

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MAKPETROL, Macedonia's state-owned energy company, has started building a
100km pipeline to carry Russian natural gas from the Bulgarian border to
Skopje, the republic's capital.
Mr Ljubomir Janev, general manager of Makpetrol, said Macedonia would cover
the full cost of the Dollars 60m project, agreed while Macedonia was still
part of Yugoslavia. Completion is scheduled for early 1995.
He said that Macedonia could afford the project because the pipe sections
were being produced by a local manufacturer, the state-owned Macedonia
Pipeworks.
According to Mr Janev, the pipeline would reduce the country's dependence on
imported oil. It would also enable the Skopje refinery to increase its
production of jet fuel and other petroleum products, because it would no
longer have to produce fuel oil for industry and domestic heating.
Macedonia will buy up to 800,000 cubic metres of gas annually from
Gazexport, the Russian supplier. The price has not yet been negotiated but
Macedonia expects to arrange a barter agreement with payment in local
products.
The pipeline is the first important infrastructure project to be launched in
Macedonia since it broke away from the former Yugoslavia in 1991. There are
plans to extend the pipeline to neighbouring Albania.

SKODAEXPORT, the Czech trading and contracting company, has won a Dollars
370m (Pounds 247m) contract to build an oil pipeline linking the Indian
cities of Kundla in Gujarat and Bhatinda in Punjab, the company said in
Prague yesterday.
Mr Jan Ricica, the Skodaexport general manager, said that the company had
won the contract after a year of negotiations.
The pipeline will be 1,440 kms long, and construction will include six
stations and two terminals. The pipeline, equipped with modern electronic
systems, will be able to transport several different types of oil products.
Mr Ricica said that the company hoped its success in winning the contract
against fierce competition would help it develop its international business.
Skodaexport already has large contracts in China, Turkey and Egypt, and is
negotiating over new projects in these countries.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TALKS on rescuing the proposed regional jet joint venture between British
Aerospace and Taiwan Aerospace Corporation (TAC) yesterday splintered into a
series of meetings largely among Taiwanese officials over the details of a
draft deal.
Mr Denny Ko, TAC's president, was hopeful of agreement on the financial
structure 'within 24 hours'.
A team led by Mr John Cahill, BAe's chairman, has been in talks with
Taiwanese bankers, politicians and industrialists since Monday.
The joint venture, Avro, is central to his strategy to improve BAe's
profitability. The RJ series of regional jets that it would build partly in
Taiwan currently loses money.
A contract establishing the joint venture was signed last January, but
Taiwanese banks lending money to Avro expressed fears last month that it was
too risky.
The latest round of talks involved lawyers, the state-owned Chiao Tung Bank,
which leads the consortium of lender banks, the Ministry of Economic
Affairs, Taiwan's industry ministry, and other government departments.
Mr Ko also held meetings with Taiwan's defence ministry to discuss what part
of the RJ programme could be most easily transferred to Taiwan.
The defence ministry's Aero Industry Development Centre (AIDC) would be
involved in RJ assembly and the development of any new aircraft, called the
RJ-X.
Major General Shin You-kwon, who heads the assembly of Taiwan's
home-produced supersonic fighter aircraft, stressed the significance of
winning RJ-X work.
'This project would bring real benefit in learning design and manufacture
(of civil aircraft),' he said.
Taiwan has a well-developed military aerospace industry. More than 200
companies supply components to the AIDC. But the government halved its order
for the supersonic fighter aircraft after it agreed last year to buy US and
French fighters from General Dynamics and Dassault.
The government now wants to encourage the aerospace industry to diversify
away from the defence sector.
It plans to turn AIDC into a semi-autonomous state company next July and
privatise it towards the end of the decade.

FT  27 AUG 93 / World Trade News: Brussels doubles duty on sacks from China
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Commission has almost doubled anti-dumping duties on plastic
woven sacks imported into the Community from China, after manufacturers
allegedly absorbed the original duties instead of increasing prices.
It is only the second time that the Commission has used its fast-track
'anti-absorption' procedure, which allows it to increase anti-dumping duties
without opening a new full inquiry.
The plastic sacks will be subject to an overall anti-dumping duty of 85.7
per cent. 'A measure aimed at restoring the effect of the duty concerned is
in the Community's interest,' said the Commission.
The anti-absorption procedure was introduced in 1988, but not used as the
basis for an inquiry until 1991. Some Brussels trade lawyers have suggested
the fast-track procedure may infringe Gatt rules. Importers have also
pointed out the reverse procedure - which allows for refunds when duties
prove to be too high - is much slower.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A NEW tax on cheques came into force in Brazil yesterday, amid legal actions
to challenge its constitutionality, Christina Lamb writes from Rio de
Janeiro.
The 0.25 per cent tax on financial operations is a crucial part of the
government's attempts to plug a federal budget deficit expected to reach the
equivalent of Dollars 31.5bn next year.
The government hopes to raise Dollars 600m per month through the tax, to
remain in force until the end of next year.
However, legal actions against the tax have been launched throughout the
country by unions, business, and local governments.
Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, finance minister, said yesterday that, if the
actions continued, the government would appeal to the Supreme Court.
In a further move to increase revenue, the government is hoping to change
the income tax structure to penalise the rich. The revenue service is
preparing to propose to Congress a new top tax of 35 per cent for those on
higher incomes. There are two tax rates now - 15 and 25 per cent.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary-general, recommended yesterday that
the Security Council suspend oil and arms embargoes on Haiti and release
frozen Haitian assets, AP reports from New York.
The council scheduled closed consultations for yesterday evening, New York
time, when it might vote on the recommendation.
A UN spokesman said the recommendation was being made because of the
ratification of Mr Robert Malval as the new prime minister of Haiti. Under
the peace accords signed last month by President Jean-Bertrand Aristide and
the Haitian army, the sanctions may be suspended after a new government has
been sworn in.
Mr Malval won final parliamentary approval in Haiti late on Wednesday. The
president is to be restored to power by October 30.
The sanctions were imposed in an effort to force Haitian military leaders,
who overthrew Father Aristide nearly two years ago, to permit his return to
the country and to power, as well as to restore democracy. They include an
oil embargo and ban on sales of all weapons, ammunition and military
equiment.

FT  27 AUG 93 / Eyes on Argentina's presidency: The ambitions - much denied
 -of Domingo Cavallo, the popular economy minister who lacks a politician's
touch
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ARGENTINA'S economy minister, Mr Domingo Cavallo, is one of the most popular
men in the country, rightfully credited with having transformed it from
economic basket-case to free market showcase.
Although he denies harbouring any political ambitions, stressing that he is
merely an economist who lacks the politician's common touch, the tireless
rumour mills of Buenos Aires consider Mr Cavallo more and more
presidenciable (made of presidential timber) with every passing day.
President Carlos Menem's six-year term is to end in July 1995, but he wants
to be re-elected. He is campaigning hard for an amendment to the
constitution, which allows no Argentine president a second successive terms.
However, most observers doubt he will be successful - hence the speculation
over Mr Cavallo's future.
Conjecture that he is planning to launch himself fully into politics grew
stronger when, this month, he practically took over the campaign of Mr Juan
Schiaretti, an old friend and until recently his trade and industry
secretary, who won a narrow victory in Peronist party primary elections for
a Chamber of Deputies seat in Cordoba province.
The Congressional elections are scheduled to be held on October 3.
But one of his close aides said: 'No, Cavallo is not interested in the
presidency. He is not going to risk throwing overboard everything he has
achieved as economy minister.
'The aim is to get Schiaretti into Congress, where he can exercise his
leadership abilities to move legislation stuck there.'
Mr Menem has made the re-election of his government its overriding political
objective. He spends an increasing amount of time campaigning throughout the
country, handing out land deeds, kissing babies and pressing flesh.
Mr Cavallo is only too aware of the dangers of crossing Mr Menem and rarely
misses an opportunity to proclaim his allegiance to the president. On
Monday, the latter sacked his interior minister, Mr Gustavo Beliz, for
having raised doubts about the re-election campaign.
In his resignation letter, Mr Beliz wrote that he objected to the 'methods
and proposals (used) to attain the objective of the reform of our
(constitution), which are generating inadmissible suspicion'.
Mr Beliz is believed to have been alluding to intimidation and attacks on
journalists thought to oppose Mr Menem's re-election. Two newspaper
reporters - one from the mass-circulation Clarn and another from the
opposition Pagina/12 - have been beaten up by thugs thought to belong to
shadowy Peronist groups.
Nearly all Argentina's civilian presidents over the last 50 years have tried
to lift the re-election ban.
Only the late Juan Peron himself was able to do so. He was re-elected in
1951, but was toppled in a coup four years later.
It is not easy to amend the Argentine constitution, and time is running
against Mr Menem. First, two-thirds of both chambers of Congress must agree
the 'necessity' to reform the constitution. But Mr Menem lacks sufficient
votes and is unlikely to win much more support after the elections in
October.
He is thinking of calling a plebiscite on the issue before Christmas.
Plebiscites are not binding on Congress but a strong showing in one could
press wavering members to vote for reform.
Even if Mr Menem were to win over Congress, he would then have to win
elections for a constituent assembly. If all went well there, he would then
need to win the Peronist party's nomination as presidential candidate -
probably no great problem.
The presidential election must be held by December 1994, although the winner
will not take office for six months.
Close aides to Mr Cavallo say his main aim is to ensure that economic policy
does not fall victim to political infighting. This concern is shared by
business and by overseas investors. They would react immediately - and
negatively - to any serious relaxation of rigour in policy for political
reasons.
If Mr Menem's re-election bid were to fail, Mr Cavallo would not seek the
nomination for himself, one aide said. Instead, 'you can be certain that
Cavallo will be one of the half-dozen people who will decide who the
Peronist candidate will be, and therefore who the next president will be'.
Mr Cavallo can afford to wait. He will be only 55 in 2001, when the
presidential election after next would be held. Analysts say the
argumentative Mr Cavallo should use the time to hone his political skills.
'Cavallo is not a politician,' commented one western diplomat. 'He needs to
learn to control his temper, learn how to handle people and crowds. He needs
to learn to be a politician.'
He owes his high standing in opinion polls - in which he usually outstrips
Mr Menem - to a reputation for unblemished honesty and successful economic
policies which delivered the lowest Argentine inflation rate in 24 years and
9 per cent growth last year.
Mr Rosendo Fraga, a prominent political analyst, suspects that, if the
Peronists win the next presidential election, Mr Cavallo would like to stay
on as economy minister, at least for the first two years of the next
administration, to ensure a smooth transition to the new economic team.
These arguments do not convince everyone. Most observers insist that Mr
Cavallo is patiently biding his time, awaiting the inevitably negative
outcome of Mr Menem's re-election bid before making his move.

THE president of Telebras, Brazil's state telecommunications company, has
been called to testify before the country's Congress, to explain allegations
that his former finance director attempted to extort Dollars 15m (Pounds
10.1m) from Merrill Lynch, the US securities house.
The allegations began circulating in the Brazilian financial markets in
July, when Merrill Lynch was not appointed lead manager for the company's
forthcoming Dollars 500m launch of American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) in
New York.
Merrill Lynch had handled the company's Eurobond offerings and was expected
to manage the ADR issue.
The charges become public after the resignation of Mr Mauro Brito as finance
director of Telebras last week. Press reports in Brazil alleged that he was
forced to quit because he had demanded money from Merrill Lynch for the firm
to keep its position managing the issue. Mr Brito denies the allegations.
Telebras has made countercharges, claiming irregularities in the launch of
Eurobonds carried out by Merrill Lynch in 1991 and 1992, and claiming that
the brokerage had received commission four times higher than market rates.
According to the newspaper O Globo, Mr Iram Siqueira Lima, former finance
director of Telebras, has written to Mr Adyr da Silva, its current
president, admitting that Merrill Lynch had received a commission above
market rates for the Eurobonds issue. However, he pointed out that, at the
time, Telebras did not have a good image in the market and that Merrill
Lynch had guaranteed to place all the bonds.
Merrill Lynch issued an official statement on Wednesday night denying the
allegations: '(The company) strongly rejects any suggestion of irregularity
in its dealings with Telebras,' it said.
Traders are watching events carefully, as Telebras shares represent 60 per
cent of the Sao Paulo stock market index and are a favourite of foreigner
buyers, often accounting for more than half of daily trading. Congressman
Paulo Heslander, who demanded that Congress investigate, said: 'These
charges are damaging the image of Brazil overseas.'
This is expected to delay the launch of the ADRs, which was expected before
the end of this year. Another US securities house, Smith Barney Shearson,
has warned clients that the launch might now take place in the middle of
next year.

FT  27 AUG 93 / Clinton calls for floods rethink
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Clinton administration is urging army engineers and other government
agencies to look at different ways of controlling floods as they examine
whether to rebuild dams and earthwork levees after this year's inundation of
the Mississippi and Missouri river basins.
In a memorandum greeted enthusiastically by environmentalist groups, the
White House asked agencies to consider 'non-structural alternatives' such as
buying up farmland in the river plain to be used as catchment areas for
future floods.
The White House paper says, however, that the administration does not intend
to reject local demands that specific levees be rebuilt.
Environmentalist groups, such as American Rivers, have claimed that levees
along the Mississippi forced the river higher than it would otherwise have
been by denying it natural outlets to swamps and wetlands in the river
bottom, and also encouraged people to build in flood-prone areas.
Nevertheless, most of the flood-walls and levees built and managed by the
federal government, under the auspices of the Army Corps of Engineers, are
likely to be rebuilt.
Federal levees, which typically protect large urban or industrial areas, are
much higher and stronger than private earthworks. Only an estimated 40 per
cent of the roughly 500 federal levees in the Mississippi and Missouri
basins failed or were topped by this year's record floods, compared with
around 85 per cent of private levees.
The Corps has already put out tenders for some immediate repair projects,
and aims to get as much construction work done as possible before winter.
However, federal officials will also insist that many homeowners move to
higher ground, leaving their land as a buffer zone for future floods.

<TEXT>
POLAND'S entry into the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation may have come a
step closer after the apparent removal of Russian objections.
In a joint statement issued in Warsaw this week, Russia's President Boris
Yeltsin and Poland's President Lech Walesa declared that Poland's wish to
join Nato did 'not run counter to the interests of any state, including
Russia'.
The possible expansion of Nato's membership to the east is a core component
in the debate over the alliance's future. But western governments have
usually argued that Russian sensitivity to the inclusion of its former
allies in Nato was the principal obstacle to such an expansion.
Many academics and some politicians argue that bringing countries such as
Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic into Nato could stabilise central
Europe and help deal with the regional and ethnic conflicts on Europe's
periphery.
A recent poll showed 57 per cent of Poles favoured Nato entry.

FT  27 AUG 93 / Economic signals flash red and green: The conflicting
figures in an attempt to see what they add up to
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US economy is disconcertingly Janus-faced.
The signals from Wall Street could hardly be more encouraging. A strong
stockmarket rally has swept the Dow Jones industrial average through the
3,600 barrier and into uncharted territory. The yield on the benchmark long
bond, meanwhile, has dropped sharply to only just above 6 per cent, far
lower than most analysts would have thought possible a year ago.
Yet the real economy remains disturbingly sluggish. Wednesday's report of a
3.8 per cent decline in new orders for durable goods between June and July
was typical of recent economic indicators, which have invariably been weaker
than analysts expected.
The biggest shock was inflicted by last week's trade figures for June, which
showed a deficit of Dollars 12.1bn. This was about 40 per cent larger than
expected and constituted the biggest shortfall since 1987, when the Reagan
economic boom was still under way.
In the light of these figures, most forecasters now expect economic growth
in the second quarter to be revised down from an annual rate of 1.6 per cent
to 1 per cent, or possibly even lower. The expected recovery of growth after
the disappointing first quarter, when gross domestic product edged forward
at an annual rate of 0.7 per cent, thus failed to materialise. The robust 4
per cent growth of the last six months of the Bush administration has become
a distant memory.
There are conflicting views about the immediate economic outlook. 'The
economy is going to continue to disappoint,' says Mr Allen Sinai, a managing
director at Lehman Brothers, the securities group.
'It is hard to achieve growth when defence is being cut drastically, when
state and federal government are holding down spending, when companies are
down-sizing, and when the rest of the world is extremely weak.' Mr Sinai
predicts a continuation of the sluggish economic recovery of the past two
years, with growth likely to average about 2 per cent, far below the rate
normal in a US recovery.
But other forecasters are far more optimistic. Mr Paul Mastroddi, senior
economist at J P Morgan, the New York bank, continues to predict growth at
an annual rate of nearly 4 per cent in the second half of this year. He does
not expect the tax increases mandated in President Bill Clinton's budget to
have much effect on future growth on the grounds that the main measures have
been known since late last year. The high-income individuals most affected
by the budget have already had plenty of time to adjust.
He regards the economy's recent performance as much more encouraging than
the headline figures might suggest. At 6.8 per cent, the jobless rate is
nearly a percentage point lower than at this time last year.
Real gross domestic product is 2 1/2 per cent higher. Business equipment
investment is soaring. Corporate profits continue to register double-digit
increases. Inventories are very lean, suggesting that companies will have to
step up production to meet higher consumer demand in the current quarter.
And although a higher trade deficit arithmetically subtracts from growth,
the surge in imports last month provides further confirmation of relatively
strong domestic demand. The rising external deficit is a sign that the US is
growing faster than other countries, not evidence of weak competitiveness in
traded goods sectors.
Looking forward, the domestic economic fundamentals are mostly highly
encouraging. The inflation scare that worried the Federal Reserve earlier
this year seems over: in the past three months consumer prices have risen at
an annual rate of less than 1 per cent. Although few analysts expect prices
to remain this subdued, the underlying rate of inflation has probably
stabilised at 3 per cent, or conceivably a little less.
The decline in inflation, coupled with the passage of President Clinton's
mildly deflationary budget, has prompted sharp declines in interest rates of
all maturities. As Mr William Griggs and Mr Leonard Santow, Wall Street bond
market commentators, stressed in a recent circular, this is doing wonders
for the health of sectors strained during the late 1980s.
Banks have increased their capital ratios and should feel more comfortable
about lending. Companies and households have refinanced debt on much better
terms and should be more willing to spend. The federal government is able to
finance its considerable debt more cheaply.
Equally important, lower long-term interest rates lead to arithmetically
higher share prices because they raise the present value of future corporate
earnings. Higher share prices in turn raise the wealth - and hence spending
power - of both the personal and corporate sector.
There is no question that recent economic figures have been disappointing.
But, since exports are still only about 12 per cent of gross domestic
product, the US remains relatively well insulated from adverse international
economic trends.
Given the strong impetus from lower interest rates, it would be surprising
if economic growth does not accelerate later this year.

FT  27 AUG 93 / Zimbabwe group aims to buy blocked funds
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A ZIMBABWE tourism company is trying to buy blocked funds from former
Zimbabwe residents or foreign companies to finance its equity investment in
the Victoria Falls Safari Lodge and timeshare scheme.
The company, Glynn's Holdings, has been advertising internationally for
sellers of blocked funds who wish to remit their cash immediately, rather
than having to wait until the funds, which are held in 4 per cent 12-year or
20-year 'divestment bonds', reach maturity.
Glynn's is reported to be seeking sellers of Dollars 10m worth of the bonds,
of which there is an estimated Dollars 60m which has been blocked in
Zimbabwe by exchange controls over the years.
With the Zimbabwe dollar having devalued from 66 US cents when exchange
controls were tightened in 1984 to 15 cents today, many holders have been
only too happy to sell out.

FT  27 AUG 93 / Legacy of debt for new Nigeria ruler
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GENERAL Ibrahim Babangida yesterday stepped down as Nigeria's military ruler
and installed a non-elected administration of civilians and soldiers, in
which the military is expected to retain an upper hand.
It remains unclear, however, what role, if any, will be played by the man
who seized power in 1985 and has since postponed the handover to civilian
government on three occasions.
Chief Ernest Shonekan, head of the outgoing administration which served
under Gen Babangida, was named as Nigeria's head of government.
However, the composition of the new administration remained uncertain,
although civilians are expected to outnumber the soldiers.
In a televised speech last night, Gen Babangida said: 'I believe the time
has come for me, my service chiefs, deputy chief of defence staff and
inspector general of police to give way to a new set of leadership to propel
our march towards lasting civilian democratic governance at all levels of
our country.'
He urged Nigerians to give the interim government a chance to finish the
transition to civilian rule. The new administration's length of tenure has
not been announced.
Gen Sani Abacha will continue to hold his post of defence minister in
addition to the new post of vice-president. Gen Abacha played a pivotal role
in pressuring Gen Babangida to quit office.
Several members of the outgoing Transitional Council, appointed by Gen
Babangida eight months ago to oversee the transition to civilian rule, are
expected to stay on in new jobs. Mr Aminu Saleh, former industry minister,
becomes finance minister. Mr Matthew Mbu remains foreign secretary, and Mr
Clement Apango attorney general.
New faces are likely to include Mr Don Etiebet in the strategic post of
petroleum minister, and Mr Sam Aluko, an economist, as the minister for
national planning.
Gen Babangida leaves behind a bankrupt legacy. During his eight-year rule,
Nigerians saw their country drop out of the club of middle-income countries
to join the mass of impoverished nations. Per capita income has fallen from
Dollars 1,000 in 1980 to under Dollars 300 (Pounds 203). The naira, once
worth more than the dollar, is now worth only a few cents. Nigeria owes
around Dollars 34bn to foreign creditors, including arrears.
'At least Babangida destroyed one myth for us: that civilians are more
corrupt and inefficient than the military,' a businessman in Lagos said.
The apparent winner of an election in June subsequently annulled by Gen
Babangida, publisher Moshood KO Abiola, said in London yesterday he would
return to Nigeria next week claim his mandate.
'I will go to Nigeria as soon as the dust settles and as soon as it is safe
to do so,' he said. 'I am still waiting to give my oath of office. I will
soon be president. The government will soon go home.'

<TEXT>
Mr Moeen Qureshi, Pakistan's caretaker prime minister, last night criticised
the US for applying 'unjust' sanctions against China and Pakistan over
transfer of M-11 missiles, writes Farhan Bokhari from Islamabad. In a
statement, Mr Qureshi said that Pakistan would lodge with Washington against
the decision.
Mr Qureshi said the missiles, sold by China to Pakistan a year ago, were
within the perimeters of the Missile Technology Control Regime. The
procurement of the missiles had become essential for Pakistan to defend
itself against Scud missile attacks from Afghanistan during the rule of its
previous communist regime, and also as a precaution against the development
of a variety of ballistic missiles by India.
Officials said sanctions were unlikely to damage Pakistan's economy, since
US aid had already been cut off because of allegations over Islamabad's
nuclear programme.

FT  27 AUG 93 / US in dilemma on dealings with China: Can differences be
contained or are the two sides closer to rupture?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WINSTON LORD, the US under-secretary of state, could hardly have expressed
the American dilemma over its dealings with China more succinctly.
'Our policy challenge is to reconcile our need to deal with this important
nation with our imperative to promote international values,' he told the
Senate earlier this year. 'We will seek co-operation with China on a range
of issues. But Americans cannot forget Tiananmen Square.'
Just how difficult it is proving for the two sides to achieve harmony in
their relationship was amply demonstrated again this week when the US, in
protest at Chinese sales of missile technology to Pakistan, imposed
sanctions on the export of high-technology items to China, and Beijing
responded angrily.
Scarcely a week passes, it seems, without some further irritation to
relations, involving disputes over a whole range of issues, from human
rights to the transfer of military technology.
In Beijing, US officials say that given domestic pressures on any US
administration by vocal and well-organised interest groups, it is inevitable
that Sino-US relations will have their ups and downs. The question is
whether differences can be contained, or whether the two sides are coming
closer to serious rupture.
'The problem is', said one official, 'that there is no over-arching concept
of what the relationship should be. When Nixon signed the Shanghai
Communique in 1972, no one had any idea that within a couple of decades it
would have developed as it has. For example, in the 1972 document there was
hardly a reference to business.
'Another problem,' he said, 'is that Chinese tend to entertain higher
expectations of the relationship than we do. They have convinced themselves
the relationship is more important to us than it really is.' Whatever the
truth, there is no doubt that there is often a dis-connection between US
policy towards China and expectations in Beijing. This tends to heighten
disappointment among Chinese officials when things go wrong, and risks
provoking an overreaction.
So far, and certainly since relations began picking up again in 1991, after
the chill caused by the Tiananmen massacre of 1989, periodic rows have been
contained, and business has proceeded more or less as normal.
US officials appear confident it would take a fairly extreme development to
push the Chinese into some form of retaliation that might in turn invite
further American measures, say on the trade front. They point out that
China's trade surplus with the US reached Dollars 18.2bn (Pounds 12.2bn)
last year, is second only to that of Japan, and is growing faster.
In evidence to the US Congress this month, the Central Intelligence Agency
predicted Chinese exports to the US this year would exceed imports by
Dollars 24bn, 30 per cent up on 1992. With Congress increasingly restless
over the US trade deficit, China, along with Japan, can expect a rocky road
ahead.
It would be surprising if Chinese patience were not wearing thin.
Starting last year with the row over President George Bush's decision to
allow the sale of F-16 aircraft to Taiwan, irritations have included the
long argument over renewal of the Most Favoured Nation trading status,
frequent exchanges over human rights, and recently a row over US
interference with the passage of a Chinese ship to the Middle East that
Washington claimed was carrying material to be used for making chemical
weapons.
Most galling for China, which has set its heart on securing the 2000
Olympics, may well have been last month's congressional resolution opposing
Beijing's candidacy. Indications that the Clinton administration sympathises
with the congressional majority have sharpened Chinese annoyance.
Mr He Zhenliang, head of China's Olympic Committee, said recently he was
'totally against' Congress's action 'because it's an infringement of the
Olympic principles, and that's unacceptable'.
No country is perfect,' he added, 'even the US.'
Adding to present uncertainties about how China might react to persistent
American pressure on a number of fronts is the fact that the Chinese are
undergoing a leadership transition, with various groups and individuals
jockeying for power in preparation for the passing from the scene of the
ageing paramount leader, Mr Deng Xiaoping.
Harder-line elements have made little secret of their unhappiness over what
they regard as unwarranted American interference in Chinese affairs. They
harbour suspicions that the US is motivated partly by a wish to weaken, or
at least restrain, China's growing power and influence in Asia and beyond.
They are also outraged by what they see as high-handed US opposition to
Chinese arms sales, arguing that China's weapons exports amount to only a
fraction of those of the US.
Mr Lord would not necessarily have endeared himself to the present
generation of Chinese leaders when he told the Senate that the US should
'conduct a nuanced policy towards Beijing, until a more humane system
emerges'.
'Shunning China is not an alternative,' he added. 'We need both to condemn
repression and preserve links with progressive forces which are the
foundation of our longer-term ties.'

<TEXT>
A PALESTINIAN proposal for an immediate Israeli withdrawal from the occupied
Gaza Strip and West Bank town of Jericho could help break the deadlock in
Middle East peace talks, a senior PLO official said yesterday.
Mr Nabil Shaath, PLO peace talks co-ordinator, said the idea - dubbed the
'Gaza-Jericho First' - could bypass arguments about who should control
Israeli-occupied Arab East Jerusalem which have brought the negotiations to
a standstill.
The proposal is emerging as one of the most controversial gambits made by Mr
Yassir Arafat, PLO chairman, and is likely to drive the next round of
Arab-Israeli negotiations which resume in Washington next week.
It envisages an immediate Palestinian assumption of full authority and
independence in Gaza-Jericho, leaving the rest of the West Bank under
interim self-rule.
The idea has excited many Israelis and Palestinians who believe it could
help make progress in the stalled peace process after 22 months of fruitless
negotiations.
But the proposal has also spurred a revolt within the Palestinian leadership
over what, if any, concessions must be made to Israel to reach a peace
agreement.
Palestinians who support the plan say it would produce some permanent
independent entity immediately, guarantee the PLO a governing role and
attract desperately-needed foreign financial aid.
Israel has indicated its willingness to discuss withdrawal from the Gaza
Strip, the violent and economically-decimated home to 800,000 impoverished
Palestinians.
But Jerusalem has so far remained silent on Mr Arafat's demand for the
inclusion of an enclave around Jericho in the plan.
Israel, which would like to be rid of Gaza, has also made reservations about
a full transfer of power and the establishment of what would be effectively
a Palestinian mini-state.
It is clear that in return for accepting the idea, even in a modified form,
Israel would expect big concessions from Palestinian negotiators on their
demand for territorial sovereignty during an interim period of self-rule
over Arab East Jerusalem and the Israeli settlements in the West Bank.

Mr Abdul Sattar, Pakistan's foreign minister, yesterday accused the United
States of acting on wrong information and groundless suspicion in applying
new sanctions against Pakistan, writes Farhan Bokhari from Islamabad.
He said Pakistan regretted the move, which came in the wake of allegations
that Pakistan and China had breached the international Missile Technology
Control Regime (MTCR). Mr Sattar denied that Pakistan had violated the MTCR,
although it had not yet formally ratified the regime. China had provided a
small number of short-range tactical missiles to Pakistan several years ago,
he said. It had done so after Pakistan was attacked by Soviet-made Scud
missiles, from Afghanistan.
Officials said sanctions were unlikely to damage Pakistan's economy, since
US aid had already been cut off because of allegations over Islama - bad's
nuclear programme.

FT  27 AUG 93 / Qureshi seeks to end deepening malaise: The implications of
the Pakistani premier's ambitious new programme of economic and social
measures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FARHAN BOKHARI and ALEXANDER NICOLL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN his 2 1/2 -month stint as Pakistan's caretaker prime minister, Mr Moeen
Qureshi is seeking to reverse years of profligate mismanagement which have
left the country's finance in total disorder.
It is not clear to what extent the ambitious programme of economic measures
that he announced last week will endure when a new government, subject to
familiar political constraints, takes office after elections due on October
6. But Mr Qureshi, who has no political affiliations after a 33-year career
in Washington with the World Bank and International Monetary Fund, will have
left an important legacy if he succeeds in beginning a recovery from what he
sees as a deepening malaise in Pakistani life.
His initiative goes much further than dealing with a budget crisis.
According to Mr Shahid Javed Burki, a senior World Bank official who advised
Mr Qureshi on the measures, the prime minister chose to address
long-standing problems of which the most important was 'a steep
deterioration in the social order.'
Mr Burki says there has been a collapse of law and order and of the supply
of basic services, such as safe drinking water, sanitation and electricity,
to the community - with the rich using their wealth to circumvent such
problems. He says disorder is the product of a political system in which
governments have 'failed to inculcate a sense of honesty and integrity among
officials.'
Mr Qureshi took over, following the resignations of prime minister Nawaz
Sharif and President Ghulam Ishaq Khan in July, to find the finances in a
parlous state. Official foreign exchange reserves were dangerously low after
months of political turmoil. Inflation was rising rapidly as the government
printed money to finance a spiralling budget deficit.
Among emergency measures, Mr Qureshi suspended costly programmes such as a
scheme under which members of parliament were given government funds for
development projects in their constituencies. A 'yellow taxi' scheme, a pet
project of Mr Sharif, had seen Rs15bn (Pounds 331m) lent to importers of
51,000 foreign cars which, because they were to be used as taxis, were
subject to reduced import duties. Mr Qureshi suspended it as well as a
planned 'yellow tractor' scheme. Construction of motorways on which work has
not yet started is expected to be put off.
Mr Qureshi devalued the rupee by 9 per cent in order to discourage imports
and boost exports after a Dollars 3.26bn (Pounds 2.18bn) trade deficit in
the financial year which ended June 30. Interest rates were increased by two
percentage points, and a quick-disbursing loan was sought from the IMF.
Official reserves have risen to Dollars 400m or about 2 1/2 weeks' imports
from the lowest level of around Dollars 250m last month, and the haemorrhage
in the government's finances has been halted.
Equally important, however, are the longer-term reforms which Mr Qureshi has
begun. Taxes have been imposed on both the income and wealth of Pakistan's
feudal landowners, previously exempt because of their political influence.
Though this means defying powerful vested interests, the government may
believe that the new taxes would be politically difficult to undo.
Secondly, Mr Qureshi is seeking to tighten control over the banking system
and to distance banks from political influence by granting autonomy to the
State Bank of Pakistan, the central bank.
'In recent years we have seen virtually the rape of the commercial banks
owned by the state,' says Mr Burki. Governments, he says, had no compunction
about ordering banks to make large loans for political purposes.
Thirdly, Mr Qureshi has outlined plans to step up the privatisation
programme, with most of the state's substantial assets up for sale, and to
open state monopolies in utilities to private competition. Proceeds are to
be used to retire government debt, servicing of which currently eats up some
40 per cent of government revenue.
Other steps to cut the budget deficit to a targeted 5.5 per cent of gross
domestic product include: removal of subsidies on fertilisers; a campaign to
force payment of Rs16bn of unpaid bills to the telephone and electricity
companies - defaulters are warned that their names will be published in
newspapers; and a 10 per cent rise in petroleum product prices.
More broadly still, Mr Qureshi has taken steps designed to restore public
confidence in official institutions. These include plans for tribunals to
which citizens could appeal against malpractice by customs or income tax
officials; a commission to speed up slow judicial processes which, according
to Mr Burki, are causing a breakdown in the legal framework which surrounds
business transactions; and tightening of rules on the distribution of public
assets such as land to government officials.
Will Mr Qureshi's programme last? The measures were discussed with leaders
of the main political parties, and officials say they did not disagree
privately although they are expected to criticise them during the campaign.
The government is banking on three hopes: that the need for a Dollars 1bn
medium-term IMF loan will force the new government to adhere to the plans,
which have the IMF's backing; secondly that the new government will allow Mr
Qureshi to take the heat for politically unpalatable measures but will not
rescind them; and thirdly that support for Mr Qureshi by army generals - who
worry that the budget situation might force cuts in defence spending - will
help to give the programme longevity.
'These reforms have a good chance of survival because they are backed by
powerful interests domestically and in the outside world, but there are new
risks now of public unrest if life becomes too difficult in the coming
months,' says one leading banker - referring especially to the inflationary
impact of some of the measures.

FT  27 AUG 93 / Babangida makes way for new ruler
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ADAMS and LESLIE CRAWFORD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ABUJA, LAGOS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GENERAL Ibrahim Babangida yesterday stepped down as Nigeria's military ruler
and installed a non-elected administration of civilians and soldiers, in
which the military is expected to retain an upper hand.
It remains unclear, however, what role, if any, will be played by the man
who seized power in 1985 and has since postponed the handover to civilian
government on three occasions.
The composition of the administration was also uncertain, although civilians
are expected to outnumber the soldiers.
In a prepared speech due to be broadcast last night, Gen Babangida said: 'I
believe the time has come for me, my service chiefs, deputy Chief of Defence
Staff and Inspector General of Police to give way to a new set of leadership
to propel our march towards lasting civilian democratic governance at all
levels of our country.'
He urged Nigerians to give the interim government a chance to finish the
transition to civilian rule. The new administration's length of tenure has
not been announced.
Chief Ernest Shonekan, head of the outgoing administration which served
under Gen Babangida, was expected to be named as Nigeria's head of
government.
Gen Sani Abacha will continue to hold his post of defence minister in
addition to the new post of vice-president. Gen Abacha played a pivotal role
in pressuring Gen Babangida to quit office.
Several members of the outgoing Transitional Council, appointed by Gen
Babangida eight months ago to oversee the transition to civilian rule, are
expected to stay on in new jobs. Mr Aminu Saleh, the former industry
minister, becomes finance minister. Mr Matthew Mbu remains foreign
secretary, as does Mr Clement Apango as attorney general. And Comrade Uche
Chukwumerije, nicknamed the 'North Korean' for his zeal in promoting the
Babangida regime, stays put as information minister.
New faces are likely to include Mr Don Etiebet in the strategic post of
petroleum minister, and Mr Sam Aluko, an economist, as the minister for
national planning.
What was meant to be the crowning moment of Nigeria's transition to
democracy degenerated into cruel farce as Gen Babangida kept secret the
identity of his successors until the last minute of his rule.
Gen Babangida leaves behind a bankrupt legacy. During his eight-year rule,
Nigerians saw their country drop out of the club of middle-income countries
to join the mass of impoverished nations. Per capita income has fallen from
Dollars 1,000 in 1980 to under Dollars 300. The naira, once worth more than
the dollar, is now worth only a few cents. Nigeria owes around Dollars 34bn
to foreign creditors, including arrears.
'At least Babangida destroyed one myth for us: that civilians are more
corrupt and inefficient than the military,' a businessman in Lagos said.

FT  27 AUG 93 / N Korea in grip of 'collapsists' and 'gradualists': Some new
(and some old) delights for Pyongyang watchers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BURTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NORTH KOREA is on the brink of collapse. The 81-year-old president Kim
Il-sung, who has ruled the country since 1945, is dying. His son and heir,
Mr Kim Jong-il, has been severely injured in a car crash.
There is unrest in the army. A group of high-ranking military officers have
been executed for plotting a coup. Meanwhile, food riots are sweeping the
country as a hungry populace faces the threat of starvation.
That is what is happening in North Korea according to the rumours and
reports that have circulated in Seoul this summer.
But many of these same stories have been heard for the past decade and the
latest spate of reports are either unconfirmed or have proved to be false.
For example President Kim and his son were certainly not bedridden when they
appeared at a ceremony commemorating the 40th anniversary of the Korean War
armistice recently.
Sources of information on North Korea are scanty: the country's media,
diplomats based in the capital Pyongyang, the occasional defector, and
foreign travellers, mainly ethnic Koreans who are allowed to visit
relatives.
'North Korea is a great black hole in terms of information and people like
to fill it with their own wishful thoughts,' said Mr Michael Breen, a
consultant on North Korea for Seoul-based Merit Communications.
'Anti-communists look for signs of imminent collapse, while South Korean
officials, who prefer a gradual approach to unification, search for evidence
of stability in the north.'
The difference in interpretation also extends to North Korea watchers, who
are divided into two camps: 'collapsists' who foresee the swift downfall of
North Korea, and 'gradualists' who believe that the country can survive if
pragmatic economic reforms are introduced soon.
'We know the economic situation in North Korea is serious,' said Mr Tae Hwan
Ok, research director for the Research Institute for National Unification.
'But there is little reliable information to know what is really happening
there.'
There are few doubts that the North Korean economy is deteriorating after
more than a decade of stagnant growth. A drastic cut in economic aid,
including vital oil supplies, from China and Russia, has caused an energy
shortage and greatly reduced industrial production.
South Korea's central bank estimates that the North Korean economy
contracted by 7.6 per cent in 1992 for a third consecutive year of decline,
after a 3.7 per cent drop in 1990 and a 5.2 per cent drop in 1991.
Adding to the economic problems is a shortfall in grain production, the
result of bad weather and a lack of fertilisers and pesticides as the
energy-strapped petrochemical industry fails to meet demand.
There have been persistent rumours of food riots in the country since 1991,
although none has been confirmed by reliable sources, according to South
Korean officials.
There has been speculation that spreading food riots may be the reason why
North Korea has tightened restrictions on foreigners travelling to the
country since May.
Pyongyang, for example, reduced sailings this summer of a passenger ship
that carries Korean-Japanese visitors between Niigata, Japan and Chongjin,
North Korea. It said yesterday that regular sailings would be resumed next
week.
However, said on analyst, 'food shortages would more likely occur in early
spring as stocks become depleted after the main fall harvest rather than
during the summer when other food products are available'.
Instead, the travel restrictions may be related to North Korea's dispute
with the international community over the inspection of its nuclear
facilities, he said. 'The North Koreans don't want foreigners prying around
at such a sensitive time.'
Most North Korea watchers believe, however, that there have been isolated
raids on local grain depots and food supply trucks by hungry citizens.
'Our assessment is that public loyalty to Kim Il-sung remains firm despite
the economic problems,' said Mr Ok. 'We see no indication of a revolution
brewing from the bottom up.' If a food riot took on anti-government
overtones, it would be quickly crushed, he added.
However, the Korean peninsula is expected to suffer a poor grain harvest
this autumn because of a cool summer, resulting in a dwindling food supply
for North Korea by early 1994.
A sign of trouble at the top was offered this week by a North Korean
defector, a 30-year-old army lieutenant, who claimed that a group of
military officers were executed last December for planning a military coup.
There have been similar rumours of coup attempts in 1986, 1991 and 1992,
although there has been no evidence to support the claims.
'He's not lying, but he appears to repeating rumours he heard in the
barracks room,' said Mr Breen, who said such stories are one of the
attractions of analysing North Korea.
'The beauty of North Korea watching is that it allows your imagination to
roam.'

In a joint statement issued in Warsaw this week, Russia's President Boris

join Nato did 'not run counter to the interests of any state, including
Russia'. The possible expansion of Nato's membership to the east is a core

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RUSSIA is offering members of the Commonwealth of Independent States a
choice of three options for economic relationships and co-operation.
Mr Herman Kuznetsov, deputy head of the government committee which deals
with commonwealth republics, said the first option was a10-year treaty
providing for the gradual construction of economic union.
A fast-track agreement for 'intensive economic integration' was a second
option, now being envisaged only by the three Slavic neighbours, Russia,
Ukraine and Belarus. This would be in the form of a common trading area
without internal customs barriers and with a common currency.
It would also give Ukraine a 'way out' of its indebtedness to Russia by
providing for joint ownership of valuable Ukrainian refineries and other
industrial installations starved of Russian raw materials.
A third option, which any commonwealth member could combine with either of
the economic union treaties, was for a currency union.
This would create a new type of rouble zone which he compared to the zone
franc operated by the Banque de France in some African countries.
Mr Kuznetsov explained that this menu of options, although complicated, was
designed to help the CIS out of a rut whereby for the past 18 months all its
members 'had been equal but nothing had been achieved'. Under the currency
union plan, initialled so far by Russia, Kazakhstan, and Uzbekistan,
countries would use the rouble as their national currency after adjusting
their credit, budget, and monetary policies in line with Russia's.
War-ravaged Tajikistan had expressed a desire to join, while Belarus was
still making up its mind. With this option, he said that the Russian
government was trying to 'make something useful' out of the central bank's
invalidation of pre-1993 banknotes, with which it had tried to wean the
republics off the rouble in one stroke.
Mr Kuznetsov acknowledged total currency union was the most difficult option
to implement. It would take several months to establish but republics might
view it as an assault on sovereignty.
The Russian cabinet has rejected the resignation of Mr Sergei Glaziev, the
foreign economic relations minister. Mr Glaziev had offered to resign over
pressures from officials whose corrupt interests he said he had threatened.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE FUTURE of the peace plan for Bosnia today hangs in the balance as the
three ethnic assemblies vote on a proposal to divide their republic.
The Bosnian parliament was seen as holding the crucial vote, because Serb
and Croat assemblies were likely to back the plan after endorsement by their
leaders.
Mr Alija Izetbegovic, Bosnia's president, has already said he could not
support the proposal, which leaves the mostly Moslem republic with
disjointed landlocked territory.
Bosnia's Serb, Croat and Moslem leaders are due to return to Geneva next
week to deliver the verdicts of their parliaments.
Deputies to the Serb assembly yesterday met behind closed doors in Pale,
their mountain stronghold outside Sarajevo, amid reports of complaints that
Serb leaders had given too many concessions to their rivals.
The proposed map, put forward last week by Lord Owen and Mr Thorvald
Stoltenberg, international mediators, in an attempt to end the 17-month war,
gives Serbs about 54 per cent of territory, Croats 17 per cent, and Moslems
some 28 per cent.
In a move to consolidate his control over the Yugoslav army, Serbian
President Slobodan Milosevic yesterday sacked 42 generals, including chief
of staff General Zivota Panic. He will be replaced by Gen Momcilo Perisic,
age 49, who was promoted to that rank during the Croatian war. He drew
widespread criticism from western diplomats in April 1992 for ordering
intense bombardment of the south-western town of Mostar, now consumed by
Croat-Moslem clashes.
The European Community yesterday said it would study how it could help
administer Mostar provided Bosnia's warring parties accept a Geneva peace
deal.
The carefully worded statement, issued through the Belgian presidency,
avoided any final commitment to the idea announced by Lord Owen last week
that the EC should take charge of administering Mostar for two years.
In New York, it was announced last night that Mr Stoltenberg, the UN special
envoy, and Gen Jean Cot, UN force commander, had ordered an investigation
into allegations of 'improper conduct' by UN troops and civilian personnel
in former Yugoslavia.
This was focusing on Sarajevo where some UN soldiers and civilians are
alleged to have trafficked in drugs and engaged in black marketeering and a
prostitution racket.

MR Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary general, is expected to tell Mr
Manfred Worner, the secretary general of Nato, that the UN will be unable to
provide the estimated 40,000 additional peacekeepers needed to enforce any
Bosnia settlement because of lack of funds.
Mr Boutros Ghali will meet Mr Worner in Geneva next Monday, when talks
between the warring parties are scheduled to resume. Mr Boutros Ghali has
already given this message to Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg, his representative in
the peace talks.
Also, the secretary general believes the proposed number would be
unacceptable to the UN Security Council, although it is substantially lower
than the 50,000-75,000 troops envisaged in an earlier, now defunct, plan
drafted by Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen.
Addressing an emergency meeting of the budgetary committee last night, the
secretary general spoke of a 'grave financial crisis' in which the UN was
'living from hand to mouth'. While costs ran at Dollars 310m a month, only
seven of the 184 members had fully paid their dues and reserves were totally
depleted. There was enough cash in hand only for the next two weeks, after
which all UN operations would be in jeopardy.

MR Manfred Kanther, Germany's interior minister, yesterday pledged to step
up surveillance of far-right organisations as the number of racist crimes
was reported to have risen dramatically last year.
Crimes committed by far-right groups increased by 70 per cent in 1992 to
2,584, of which 17 led to deaths. More than 90 per cent of the violence was
directed against foreigners, the office for the protection of the
constitution, the German internal security agency, said in its annual
report. The wave of politically-motivated violence is continuing this year,
with 1,300 crimes reported in the first six months.
The number of people joining far-right organisations rose by 2,000 to nearly
43,000 last year. Members were spread in 82 groups, as compared with 76 the
year before.
Mr Kanther said the security services would intensify their surveillance of
groups from both the far right and the far left. But he stressed that police
and legal actions should be combined with social and educational measures to
prevent more youngsters from joining existing far-right organisations.
Mr Kanther blamed the media for showing violence on television and called on
municipalities to take measures to get young, jobless people 'off the
streets'.
Such words are likely to provide little comfort to organisations which have
been lobbying for tough action to crack down on far-right violence.
Leaders of the local Turkish community, whose members have been regularly
singled out for murder attempts, have been calling for a strict
anti-discrimination law as well as bans on extreme political organisations.
They say that the conservative government has been reluctant to investigate
the links between the aggressors and far-right political groups.
The federal Interior Ministry last year banned three of the 84 existing
far-right groupings in Germany.
Legal suits have also been brought against two of their leaders for abusing
the freedom of expression guaranteed in the constitution.
Mr Kanther said bans were a last resort. He added that no new law was needed
but that the existing legal framework should be improved. Measures proposed
by the government aim to facilitate police investigations and to introduce
higher penalties for people obstructing the judiciary.
Far-left groupings increased their membership by 2,000 last year to 28,500
members.

FT  27 AUG 93 / Hybrid policy found for franc: Paris comes to terms with new
monetary order of the ERM
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
FRANCE'S political and financial leaders have been tight-lipped about the
direction of monetary policy in the three weeks since the European exchange
rate mechanism was forced into humiliating reform.
However, remarks by Mr Edouard Balladur, the French prime minister, that
France is in no hurry to return to the narrow fluctuation bands within the
ERM suggest the French government is coming to terms with the new monetary
order.
'It was a revealing comment,' says Mr Christopher Potts, economist at Banque
Indosuez in Paris. 'It shows they are following a hybrid policy which is
neither a free float nor a system in which interest rates are determined
solely by the exchange rate.'
Under the former system, the French franc could fluctuate by a maximum of
2.25 per cent from its central ERM parity. The currency crisis, however,
broke the franc's close link with the D-Mark and forced the fluctuation band
to be widened to 15 per cent.
The reform undermined the central plank of French monetary policy, a strong
franc and the tight link with the D-Mark. It presented Mr Balladur and the
French financial authorities with the question of how to manage monetary
policy in the new European exchange rate environment.
Mr Balladur's comment points to some answers. 'We must not return in all
haste to the narrow band of currency fluctuations. Neither must we seek, or
without seeking it, get to the point where the wide band is reached,' the
prime minister said.
The implication is that the French government is adopting a more pragmatic
stance to exchange rate and interest rate policy. 'Their boundaries are less
rigid than before,' said one French economist. 'Interest rates have a
slightly higher priority than before in guiding policy.' For the French
government, this stance has several advantages. It gives them room for
manoeuvre in cutting interest rates to help stimulate the recession-hit
economy. The removal of tight exchange rate targets also increases the risks
for currency speculators - strongly attacked by Mr Balladur for causing the
currency crisis.
But the government's response to the new European monetary order does not
represent a radical shift in economic policy.
The currency will remain an important constraint on reducing borrowing costs
and the prime minister has consistently ruled out a strategy of rapidly
reducing borrowing costs as the British did after the pound was forced out
of the ERM in September last year. 'There are no miracle cures for our
economic difficulties,' said Mr Balladur on Wednesday, emphasising his
continued commitment to anti-inflationary policies.
For interest rates, the result is likely to be a continuation of the policy
of gradual reductions.
Overnight rates have been trimmed five times since the ERM reforms, bringing
money market rates down to near pre-crisis levels. The 5- to 10-day rate and
the intervention rate, which provides a floor for money market rates, remain
unchanged at 10 per cent and 6.75 per cent respectively, but economists
believe they, too, will be edged gradually downwards.
The pace of cuts will continue to be influenced by events in Germany. The
refusal by the Bundesbank to cut interest rates yesterday may affect the
timing of reduced borrowing costs.
However, it should not change fundamentally the process, and should drive
home the arguments for a more independent approach to French monetary
policy.

CREDITORS to Italy's former Efim state holding company, put into voluntary
liquidation in July 1992, could shortly be repaid half their loans, writes
Haig Simonian in Milan.
Mr Alberto Predieri, the special administrator appointed to run Efim, said
he had been authorised by the European Commission to begin repaying loans to
the group's wholly-owned subsidiaries. Mr Predieri, who plans to meet Bank
of Italy and treasury officials next Tuesday, said he hoped the repayments
could begin next month. The remaining half of the loans is expected to be
repaid by the end of the year.
Creditors have been waiting almost 14 months for reimbursement of their
loans to Efim, which had total borrowings of about L18,000 (Pounds 7.6bn).

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SWEDEN'S centre-right government was jolted yesterday by a leaked report
from the International Monetary Fund which said its programme to cut the
country's huge budget deficit was inadequate.
Publication of the report in a daily newspaper provoked a slide in the value
of the Swedish krona and a rise in interest rates.
The IMF report said it would prefer to see savings of SKr20bn (Pounds
1.65bn) a year, double the government's current plan to trim SKr10bn in
spending.
The budget deficit stands at 16.5 per cent of gross national product, a
level which the report said 'dwarfs those in other industrial countries and
provokes doubts about Sweden's commitment to low inflation'.
The fund said its proposals would bring the budget deficit down to zero in
1998, compared with the government's target of 4.3 per cent.
Mrs Anne Wibble, the finance minister, defended her policies, saying they
provided 'the best balance' for Sweden, given the need for a return to
growth next year after a three-year period of recession.
She pointed out that most domestic political pressure was for fewer cuts,
not more. Nevertheless, markets reacted badly to the report of the IMF
comments.
The krona slipped sharply despite intervention by the central bank.
On the foreign exchange market the D-Mark rose to Skr4.88, up eight ore
since late Wednesday, then eased to Skr4.8680/30.

FT  27 AUG 93 / Global warming pact progresses

   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE INTERNATIONAL global warming treaty signed at the United Nations 'Earth
Summit' in June last year looks set to come into force ahead of expectations
early in 1994, according to UN officials.
However, two weeks of negotiations in Geneva on the detailed implementation
of the pact are due to end today without agreement on key issues such as
finance and 'joint implementation' - under which rich countries would gain
credit for financing projects in poor states.
The framework treaty, signed by more than 160 nations, commits governments
to curbing emissions of greenhouse gases which warm the earth's atmosphere.
It has now been ratified by 31 nations, against 50 required for entry into
force, and another 34 have said they will ratify this year.
The pact will not, however, be fully operational until final decisions on
its functioning are taken by a conference of member states tentatively
scheduled for early 1995.
The most contentious issue for the 146-nation Geneva negotiations, intended
to pave the way for the 1995 conference, has been the criteria for 'joint
implementation'. The idea is disliked by environmentalists who fear it will
weaken the resolve of industrialised countries, the biggest producers of
warming gases, to curb their own emissions. Supporters argue that it makes
sense to start reducing global emissions where this can be done most cheaply
and easily, which will often be in developing countries with low
environmental standards.
On financing, developing countries are unhappy about the potentially
dominant role of the Global Environment Facility run by the World Bank and
the UN, which they see as an extension of western and World Bank interests.
Negotiators in Geneva, who will meet again next February, have also not yet
agreed which countries will be eligible for financial help and which
projects should qualify.

'miracle man' self-destructing - Kevin Done uncovers some private thoughts
on the VW affair in other boardrooms / The Industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

VOLKSWAGEN'S rivals are watching with horrified fascination as the top
management of the leading European car producer threatens to implode.
The group's components suppliers, which are bearing the brunt of
Volkswagen's frantic attempts to cut costs, react vitriolically in private
towards the new regime in Wolfsburg headed by Mr Ferdinand Piech and Mr Jose
Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua.
In public they are more circumspect. After all, Volkswagen is one of their
biggest customers.
The fate of Volkswagen leaves no part of the motor industry untouched. It is
the world's fourth largest vehicle maker, behind only General Motors, Ford
and Toyota. For eight years in succession it has sold more cars in western
Europe than any other carmaker and in the process has established a clear
lead over its rivals.
It is the main European standard bearer in the world motor industry and
Europe's best attempt yet at creating a global carmaker with manufacturing
operations stretching from eastern Europe to Mexico and Brazil, South Africa
and China.
In different parts of the world it has formed significant alliances with
other giants in the industry, most importantly Ford in Latin America and
Europe and Toyota in Europe and Japan.
It is a key customer of many of the world's leading components suppliers
with purchases of parts and materials worldwide totalling DM53.8bn (Pounds
21.5bn) last year. The tremors from Wolfsburg travel round the world.
The unanimous view among rival carmakers and top suppliers is that Mr Lopez
cannot last much longer. And most are beginning to doubt that Mr Piech will
survive Mr Lopez's departure. The credibility of both as the corporate
leaders of one of Europe's biggest industrial concerns - whatever their
abilities as engineers - is in tatters.
More important, beyond the personalities there is concern among suppliers
about the symptoms of mismanagement and misguided strategic thinking that
may be common to both VW and General Motors, Mr Lopez's former employer, as
they seek to put their respective houses in order through short-term miracle
fixes from the messianic bearer of some new holy grail for cutting costs.
First the personalities. 'I think Lopez is a dead duck,' says the chief
executive of one of the world's biggest automotive components producers and
an important supplier to Volkswagen. 'I don't think VW can keep him. I think
Piech will go too.'
The head of a rival carmaker in Europe says of Lopez, 'the smartest thing
would be to suspend him and wait for the prosecutors and the courts to
finish their investigations.
'But Piech thinks he needs Lopez to help to turn VW round. Piech is a
zealot. He sees himself as the saviour.'
Competing carmakers give Mr Piech credit for having identified the causes of
VW's underlying problems, but not for his autocratic management style, which
is seen as rule through fear.
'He has identified the main areas that need fixing,' says one chief
executive. 'Their costs are too high, they have too many people, their
plants are over-facilitised, they have too many costs in Germany, and their
material costs are not competitive.
'But you cannot just order it to be done. It needs a softer touch. You have
to take more people along with you. VW is still a magic marque and they have
reservoirs of technical ability.'
The chief executive of another carmaker in Europe remains astonished at the
size of the reported financial package given to Mr Lopez and the impact that
will have in VW and in the industry. 'For that money you are paying a
miracle worker. Then his colleagues will say, you are paid to work miracles,
you fix it.'
Among some of the biggest components suppliers there is also concern at the
way in which first General Motors, and now Volkswagen are trying to batter
down their purchasing costs.
The rhetoric in the industry is all about reform of the old adversarial
relationships between the vehicle makers and their suppliers.
Some have taken the reforms seriously, forming long-term relationships with
key suppliers, giving the suppliers responsibility for research and
development but also giving life-time contracts building on shared
continuous improvement. Chrysler is now the shining example for the success
of this approach.
The Lopez approach is seen by suppliers as having the same rhetoric, but in
reality the old approach is unchanged.
'There is shock and confusion at suppliers. We have contracts where we have
spent millions of D-Marks, where we have shaken hands, but where there were
no formal signatures. And Lopez came in and said he was putting the business
out for new tenders,' says one leading VW supplier.
'Lopez got carried away with himself in the US, he was given the role and
mantle of saviour,' says a chief executive in the components industry.
'Both VW and GM must now act to regain the confidence of their suppliers.
Their approach hurts, because suppliers cut corners, they will not invest
for the vehicle makers. There will be recalls, assembly lines shut down and
customer dissatisfaction.'
In the bare-knuckle fight with GM over Mr Lopez and industrial espionage, Mr
Piech has cast himself as the saviour of the European car industry, but his
performance to date has won few converts among his peers.

FT  27 AUG 93 / VW and the Lopez espionage affair: Shy investigators relish
the limelight - The Prosecutors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The raids yesterday by German police and prosecutors on Volkswagen's
headquarters and other facilities in Wolfsburg marked an extraordinary
day in the history of the German car industry. Officials in Bonn did not
hide their concern over the potential political and economic damage
which could ensue from the battle 'between two great German car
companies'.
Christopher Parkes examines the personalities and issues in what one
German judge said could be 'potentially the biggest-ever case of
industrial espionage'.
IT TOOK almost two months and a jump-start for German public prosecutors to
get down to the real work of investigating Adam Opel's suspicions of theft
and industrial espionage against Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua and
several of his colleagues.
But as yesterday's raid in Lower Saxony demonstrated, things have moved on
apace since then.
Opel first laid its suspicions before the economic crimes division in the
Darmstadt prosecutors' office at the end of April. It followed up as
requested with more information and written sworn testimony from Opel
employees in nearby Russelsheim and GM staff in Detroit, documenting
allegations of systematic data collection.
In the meantime, Ms Dorothea Holland, the investigator in charge of the
case, took a holiday.
Even when she returned, Opel was frustrated by the lack of apparent
movement, although the nature of criminal investigators' work - in Germany
as elsewhere - militates against transparency. However, after a little
judicious prompting through the good offices of the Hesse state justice
ministry in late June, Ms Holland and her team had their heads down and have
had them down since.
What a German judge recently described as 'potentially the biggest-ever case
of industrial espionage' and what is persistently proclaimed a 'unique'
probe in local media reports, has clearly caught the imagination of the
office's 70-odd investigators.
Accustomed to a low profile and little media interest, they now seemingly
welcome the attention. Mr Georg Nauth, a senior prosecutor and spokesman for
the team, has become a common sight on television.
He, too, has polished up his act after an uncertain beginning. He even
appears to have bought a new tie. Although his repertoire of rigorous 'no
comments' and occasional drip-fed details remains the standard fare, he
seems to enjoy mildly teasing clamorous journalists, and is not afraid of
speaking his mind.
It was specifically in response to the clamour that he issued an explosive
press release in late July. This revealed that documents which should have
been restricted to the top management of General Motors and its German
subsidiary, Adam Opel, had been found - 'where they did not belong', Mr
Nauth noted - in boxes left in a house, apparently by colleagues of Mr Lopez
who had followed him to VW.
The VW production director was also declared to have had a direct connection
with some of the other data.
Charges from Mr Ferdinand Piech, VW chairman, that the statement was
one-sided - on the grounds that only Opel people had been asked to identify
the data - were rejected by Mr Nauth as 'incomprehensible'. Why, he
wondered, would anyone ask Opel's arch-rival to identify what seemed to be
secret Opel property?
Meanwhile, his press statement noted, the probe would continue with
particular emphasis on the interrogation of VW employees. Since then, Mr
Carl Hahn, former chairman of VW, Mr Daniel Goeudevert, a recently-ousted
board member, and Mr Klaus Liesen, head of the VW supervisory board, have
been to Darmstadt.
But the most promising recent witnesses appear to have been far more junior
employees, including computer operators who might have inserted Opel data
into the VW system.
Ms Holland has remained throughout unapproachable and silent. But Mr Nauth,
separated from the central investigation by a 'Chinese wall', continued to
spice his permitted briefings with his own commentary.
Just over a week ago, for example, when VW was launching its own private
investigation of its files and data bases, he appeared almost scornful. The
prosecutors' office was in possession of more information than was available
to independent auditors. It also had more powers. The VW team could not
question sworn witnesses, nor could it confiscate documents, he said.
The prosecutors demonstrated some of these powers in yesterday's swoop. Mr
Nauth, meanwhile, leaves for holiday today heading for a Tunisian beach with
a good book.

FT  27 AUG 93 / VW and the Lopez espionage affair: Peace plea fails to catch
the mood - Rexrodt is caught up in an inter-family squabble he believes has
gone too far / The Minister
</HEADLINE>

The raids yesterday by German police and prosecutors on Volkswagen's
headquarters and other facilities in Wolfsburg marked an extraordinary
day in the history of the German car industry. Officials in Bonn did not
hide their concern over the potential political and economic damage
which could ensue from the battle 'between two great German car
companies'.
Christopher Parkes examines the personalities and issues in what one
German judge said could be 'potentially the biggest-ever case of
industrial espionage'.
MR Gunter Rexrodt, the German economics minister, was due to have a parental
chat with Mr David Herman, Opel chairman, at Frankfurt airport last night.
At the end of a day of extraordinary events at Volkswagen headquarters, he
was seeking, as he has for the past week, to defuse the clash between Mr
Herman and Mr Ferdinand Piech, VW chairman.
'We say it is unique for two great German motor companies to be fighting
like this in public,' the minister's spokesman said yesterday. 'He concluded
we must do something because it seems in this case that there is such human
friction, we must bring people to more reason.'
It was the minister's job to try to prevent damage to political and business
relations between the US and Germany, his spokesman added.
It has been suggested for some weeks by lowlier politicians and business
leaders that the clash over the alleged theft of Opel data and suspected
industrial espionage could well cause the sort of damage Mr Rexrodt now
fears.
But it was only a week ago, after a call from Mr Piech, that the minister
acted. His attitude appears to be that there is a inter-family squabble
going on, and his job is to shut the quarrelsome children in separate rooms
and try quietly to talk some sense into the parents.
Opel has said it will be prepared to exchange letters with VW provided
public apologies are forthcoming from the other side. It wants a withdrawal
of remarks suggesting that the US-owned company is spearheading an American
campaign to undermine the German motor industry and that it planted evidence
prejudicial to criminal investigations.
But while the probe continues at its heated pace, tempers are hardly likely
to be cool enough for a reasonable, let alone a useful exchange between the
two sides. Nor is Opel, which appears so far to have the best hand, likely
to want to be seen talking publicly. Any rapprochement could be interpreted
as a sign of weakness. The three-way contacts, supposed to be held in
secret, have been routinely followed by heartening press releases from Mr
Otto Wachs, a Volkswagen spokesman.
Nor has Opel been pleased by statements attributed to Mr Rexrodt to the
effect that he wanted the case settled in the civil courts.
While the minister probably appreciates that the criminal case is entirely
out of Opel's, VW's and political hands, his initiative came late in the
day. That it followed Mr Piech's widely criticised insinuations against
Opel, which were in turn followed by an abortive attempt by the VW chief to
open peace talks, could leave Mr Rexrodt open to suggestions that he may not
be acting altogether with the common good in mind. Opel, which has stuck
rigorously to its claim that it has reasonable grounds for suspicion -
confirmed by public prosecutors - might reasonably ask why no political
initiatives or support were forthcoming when it first declared itself the
injured party. The substance of its suspicions is that former employees
decamped to VW in possession of virtually all its business strategy for the
next 10 years.
'A way must be found for them to work together sensibly . . . their Asian
competitors must be rubbing their hands,' said Mr Rexrodt's spokesman. 'US
and European companies should co-operate to resist Asian dumping.'
That seems more an issue for Mr Rexrodt. There is already common ground
between Mr Herman and Mr Piech. Neither needs reminding of the Japanese
threat, and both know that at some stage the bridges between their two
groups must be rebuilt. But the best time is probably when the full extent
of the local damage has been assessed, and last night seemed hardly
suitable.

FT  27 AUG 93 / VW and the Lopez espionage affair: Good PR gives GM chief
the edge - The Victim
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The raids yesterday by German police and prosecutors on Volkswagen's
headquarters and other facilities in Wolfsburg marked an extraordinary
day in the history of the German car industry. Officials in Bonn did not
hide their concern over the potential political and economic damage
which could ensue from the battle 'between two great German car
companies'.
Christopher Parkes examines the personalities and issues in what one
German judge said could be 'potentially the biggest-ever case of
industrial espionage'.
THE patch of calm at the eye of the storm seems to suit Mr David Herman,
chairman of Adam Opel, the German subsidiary of General Motors.
From his office in Russelsheim, near Frankfurt, little seen and seldom
heard, he has conducted his company's campaign in the Lopez affair with a
conviction and consistency in striking contrast to the chaotic style of his
Volkswagen counterpart, Mr Ferdinand Piech.
Legal training embellished with a bit of New York street wisdom gained in
childhood has given him an edge in the fracas over Mr Piech, the engineer
from Vienna. He has a mild, relaxed manner. Mr Piech is tense and cold.
Mr Herman's standpoint has not wavered from the start of the affair this
spring, when it became known that Opel had registered with the German public
prosecution service its suspicions of the theft of thousands of items of
secret data by Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua and several colleagues who
followed him from GM to VW.
His often-repeated statement 'They had our documents. We don't have them
now, and they say they don't. Then where the hell are they?' colourfully
encapsulates Opel's case.
Reporters from the magazine, Der Spiegel, have been allowed a long leash and
granted considerable access from the top level to Opel and General Motors
employees and property. Starting in May, revelations and claims in the news
weekly - many since strengthened or largely substantiated - have played a
key role in Opel's strategy.
They have kept the public prosecutors on their toes. But more important, the
magazine's reports are the source from which German popular and political
belief in Opel's integrity and motives have grown steadily as the case has
progressed.
Skilful public affairs management is not common or even much-valued in
German industry. This is a failing which Mr Piech and Mr Klaus Liesen, the
worried chairman of his board of supervisors, have regretfully acknowledged
in the past few weeks.
While Mr Herman may be satisfied with his team's PR efforts, he has been
hurt and shocked by the reaction. He said at the outset that he expected
Opel and General Motors to be attacked. But his liberal American mentality
was not prepared for repeated claims from Mr Piech and Mr Gerhard Schroder,
the prime minister of VW's home state of Lower Saxony, that this was a
commercially-motivated attack by a 'foreign' company on Germany's finest.
Adam Opel has been established for 130 years in Germany and provides and
supports 400,000 jobs. Nor was Mr Herman, the lawyer, impressed by
suggestions that he was using the law, out of pique, as a weapon in a
personal attack on Mr Lopez.
'Inaki' Lopez was once a close colleague. They met first in the late 1970s
when both worked for GM in Spain, where both were given their first real
chance to prove themselves in business. Spain, where he met his wife, Mr
Herman readily admits, 'is associated with all the best things that ever
happened to me'.
Germany, where he has been in charge of Adam Opel for just over a year in
the middle of what Mr Piech describes as the worst motor industry crisis
since the war, has some way to go to match that.

FT  27 AUG 93 / Police raid VW head offices: Homes of ex-GM executives
searched in probe into alleged espionage
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT, WOLFSBURG, BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MORE than 60 police and criminal investigators yesterday raided Volkswagen's
head offices and the homes of several VW executives to search for secret
data allegedly stolen from Adam Opel, the General Motors German subsidiary.
At 9.30am search squads simultaneously entered eight separate locations in
and around Wolfsburg in the most dramatic move yet in the four-month-old
investigation into allegations of industrial espionage against Mr Jose
Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, VW's production director, and three colleagues.
The residences of the four men, all of whom abruptly joined VW from the US
group last March, are understood to have been among the targets. Also
searched was the VW management institute in Braunschweig, close to the
company headquarters in Wolfsburg, and the group's official guesthouse.
Around 20 public prosecution officials, an unknown number of officers from
the federal criminal bureau and 40 police from three municipal forces are
believed to have taken part.
The search had been suspended by 7.30pm, but officers were due to return
this morning, a VW spokesman said. He had no information on any material
which might have been removed.
The raid is the most significant development made known publicly since
confirmation in mid-July that secret Opel documents, some allegedly
assembled at Mr Lopez's instructions, had been found in the former home of
two of his associates. Speculation grew yesterday that Mr Lopez might be
forced to quit.
In a newspaper interview yesterday, Mr Klaus Liesen, head of the group's
supervisory board, backed away from former statements implying unconditional
backing for Mr Lopez. 'I will put my hand in the fire for no-one,' he said.
Yesterday's search comes at a delicate moment in efforts by Mr Gunter
Rexrodt, German economics minister, to broker peace talks between Mr
Ferdinand Piech, VW group chairman, and Mr David Herman, Opel chairman. The
minister was due to meet Mr Herman at Frankfurt airport last night, when he
was expected to present the Opel chief with a draft public apology from Mr
Piech for insinuations made by the VW head and colleagues against the GM
group.
Mr Franz Wauschkuhn, Mr Rexrodt's spokesman, said yesterday the government
had no interest in the legal issues, 'but we must think beyond the immediate
situation to the longer term'.
The minister was worried because of potential damage to relations between
the US and Germany. 'A way must be found for them to work together sensibly
. . . Asian competitors must be rubbing their hands,' Mr Wauschkuhn added.
Mr Liesen, appeared relaxed and well-rehearsed as the raid took place.
Several of the VW public relations team calmly repeated they had been
expecting a search, and welcomed it as a step likely to end the speculation
about Mr Lopez.
Mr Piech was out of the plant at the time of the raid, rumours about which
had circulated for almost two weeks.
Mr Georg Nauth spokesman for the Darmstadt public prosecutors' office in
charge of the criminal investigation, said time had been needed to question
witnesses and examine further evidence to pinpoint the data to be looked for
and the most likely places for it to be found.
It was unlikely that statements would be issued immediately on any possible
evidence uncovered, he said. Mr Nauth added that as well as interrogating
junior VW employees, who allegedly fed Opel data into the VW data base, the
prosecutor in charge of the case, Ms Dorothea Holland, had also questioned
Mr Carl Hahn, former VW chairman. Mr Lopez and his associates had not yet
been interviewed.
Opel said in a statement: 'We assume the investigating authorities do not
take such action without having strong reasons to do so.'

FT  27 AUG 93 / Surprise convoy visits Wolfsburg
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WOLFSBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE WORKERS at Wolfsburg, Volkswagen's home town, did not know about the
plainclothes police and lawyers who arrived in convoy at the giant factory
yesterday morning.
They did not see, or hear the seven vehicles - two Volkswagen mini-vans and
five Opel saloons - which just before 10am snaked along the wide, tree-lined
entrance to VW's 13-storey administrative block.
'Sure, we knew about all the rumours. But they raided the place today? Wow,
that's a big surprise] Well, well,' exclaimed Mario, a 24-year-old VW
technician. Mario's parents came to Germany from Italy as immigrant workers
in the late 1950s.
In the Tunnel Schanke pub, the men smoking and drinking in the long, narrow
building close to the factory gates, barely believed it.
'You're joking. You mean to tell us that the police are on the 13th floor
(where directors' offices and VW lawyers are based). Here at VW,' asked Mr
Martin Liesner, an engineer at VW for 20 years. 'But what do they want?'
Everyone in Wolfsburg either works for VW or knows someone who works there.
In fact more than 54,000 of the town's 130,000 population works there.
'Wolfsburg is Volkswagen,' local officials say.
With local unemployment at around 8 per cent, the town's workers want the
affair over quickly. 'Lopez is our hope,' said Mr Liesner: 'He can make
Volkswagen competitive, he can give us security.'
Mr Lutz Schilling, VW's director of communications, explained: 'It is not
only affecting the 13th floor. They are also checking out the marketing and
management institute (a building close to VW's private houses) and some
guesthouses,' all in and around Wolfsburg.
Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua's office is on the 13th floor. 'From
there, Mr Lopez has a view, and a vision,' said Mr Schilling, adding that Mr
Lopez was 'working all day' yesterday.
'Actually, this raid is not a surprise,' he added, with commendable sang
froid. 'We were expecting it to take place sooner. At least it will clear
the air. We will help the investigators in any way. This will end the
speculation.' But he conceded: 'This is not a fine day for anybody.'
'You ask me what is behind all this?' Mr Schilling said. 'Well, the fact
that Lopez left the number one car manufacturer in the world . . . it was a
shock for them.'
He added: 'We are happy to have Lopez. He is the best manager in the field,
the state prosecutors will give a complete picture at last.'
As he spoke workers streamed in and out of the factory as usual, impervious
to the drama taking place inside.
'This is just another normal day,' said Mahmut, who came from Tunisia 20
years ago to work for VW.

FT  27 AUG 93 / LWT chiefs to split Pounds 70m in share scheme payout
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FIFTY FOUR of London Weekend Television's present and former top managers
will split a Pounds 70m share payout next week - their reward for backing
the commercial broadcaster's successful franchise bid in 1991.
Sixteen will become paper millionaires overnight. Another nine will end up
with shareholdings worth Pounds 915,000 apiece.
The 54 will benefit under a share scheme which will give them a collective
holding in the company worth Pounds 70m. The scheme was set up after they
raised Pounds 3m in 1989 to back LWT's successful Pounds 7.58m broadcasting
franchise bid in 1991. It will take effect on Tuesday.
The biggest beneficiary will be Sir Christopher Bland, LWT's chairman: 'The
only thing that has changed as far as I am concerned is that from Tuesday I
will own close to 2 per cent of LWT, but that's all paper.'
Another winner is Mr Melvyn Bragg, LWT's arts controller, novelist and
presenter of The South Bank Show arts programme. His shareholding is likely
to be worth some Pounds 2.9m.
Mr Greg Dyke, LWT's chief executive who once rescued breakfast television
station TV-am's collapsing ratings, stands to gain some Pounds 6.9m. He
said: 'Although this does not in fact take effect until next week what
matters most to me is that from next week I will own 1.5 per cent of LWT,
the company of which I am chief executive and the company where I spend my
working life. This is very exciting.'
LWT's institutional shareholders backed the share scheme in 1989 as a way of
giving the company's top management an incentive to spur them on to win
LWT's franchise bid.
Under the scheme, the 54 will be able to trade their unlisted management and
listed preference shares from Tuesday when they are converted automatically
into ordinary shares.
The scheme's payout has been triggered by LWT's share price staying above
278p for the 20 days since the company reported its half-year financial
results, on July 29.
Today is the last day; the average share price since July 29 has been
470.4p.
According to Mr Peter Coppock, LWT's head of press relations, the 54
managers have signed confidential agreements stating how many shares they
will sell on Tuesday.
The agreement commits them to make no further sales before August 1994.
Sir Christopher anticipated that selling on Tuesday will be minimal,
reducing management share ownership from 15 per cent to about 10 per cent of
the company and making it the third largest group of shareholders.

FT  27 AUG 93 / Increase in orders lifts hopes of sustained recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOPES that Britain's economic recovery may prove to be sustained were
boosted last night by news that UK manufacturers' order books are at their
best levels for 3 1/2 years.
The Confederation of British Industry said overall demand improved and the
number of companies expecting output to increase over the next four months
rose in August compared with June and July.
Although the employers' body expressed some concern about sluggish
investment growth, it raised its forecast for growth of UK gross domestic
product next year to 3 per cent from 2.6 per cent previously. The CBI
expected economic growth this year would be 1.7 per cent compared with 1.6
per cent predicted in May.
Mr Andrew Sentance, the CBI's director of economic affairs, said 'the
outlook for the economy over the remainder of this year and next is for
steady growth accompanied by low inflation'.
The Treasury said that the latest economic indicators provided 'clear
evidence' that recovery 'is well under way'. It said growth in 1992 is
likely to be 'a little stronger' than the 1.25 per cent forecast in the
March Budget.
Meanwhile revised official figures from the Central Statistical Office
indicated that the recession of 1991 and 1992 had been slightly less deep
than previously thought.
The CBI survey of 1,520 manufacturers, carried out between July 27 and
August 18, found a majority were still complaining that orders were below
normal. But order books were at their best level since February 1990, before
the recession.
Some 35 per cent of companies said their order books were below normal
compared with 17 per cent reporting above normal orders. The difference
between the two figures, which indicates the trend, was a negative balance
of 18 per cent compared with minus 28 in July and minus 52 in August last
year.

FT  26 AUG 93 / London Stock Exchange: Drugs active
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The rehabilitation of the UK drugs sector, which began in earnest a couple
of weeks ago when a burst of US buying triggered a general rerating of the
sector, continued yesterday and was again driven by US funds.
London marketmakers were said to have been caught short of the front line
stocks such as Glaxo, Wellcome and Zeneca, all of which performed strongly.
Zeneca, first traded around 592p in May this year, following its demerger
from ICI, appreciated 15 to a record 712p on 2.4m traded. Glaxo put on 5 1/2
at 583p and Wellcome advanced 12 to 756p.
The BZW profits upgrade continued to bolster ICI, which moved up 5 to 695p.
Hickson International was a rare weak spot in the chemicals area, the shares
losing 13 to 171p after the 17 per cent profits fall and a disappointing
accompanying statement.
US activity provided the lion's share of turnover in Vodafone (8 higher at
570p), where a block of 7.5m shares was traded at 561p, simultaneously with
a block of 750,000 ADRs dealt at Dollars 84.89.
The two classes of BT made modest progress after the Pounds 500m
Eurosterling bond. BT 'old' edged up 2 1/2 to 425p and the partly paid 3 to
183p.
There was no let-up in the demand for Barclays shares, which has followed
the appointment of Mr Martin Taylor as the bank's new chief executive as
from next January. Turnover in Barclays topped 8m, with the stock price
surging ahead to close a further 10 up at a record 515p. Lloyds Bank also
attracted sustained institutional support, ending a busy session 9 to the
good at 548p. National Westminster added 5 at 495p and Standard Chartered 13
at 938p.
The composite insurance sector was much calmer, with Guardian Royal Exchange
4 firmer at 214p ahead of interim results expected this morning. Lowndes
Lambert was the pick of the insurance brokers, appreciating 12 to 443p on
talk of a broker buy note.
A broker buy recommendation was said to have boosted National Power, 8 1/2
up at 365 1/2 p. PowerGen strengthened 9 1/2 to 392 1/2 p.
The exploration and production sub-sector made further strong progress, led
by Enterprise Oil, which climbed 12 to 448p on above-average turnover of 3m
shares, with the Kleinwort Benson and Lehman Bros buy recommendations issued
earlier this week followed by advice from another of the leading UK brokers
to switch from Lasmo.
Nevertheless, Lasmo continued to push ahead, touching 146p before settling 3
up on the day at 145p. Turnover came to 5.6m, maintaining the heavy activity
seen in the stock over the past few weeks.
Hardy Oil advanced 6 1/2 to a 1993 high of 164p following recent broker buy
recommendations. Calor, another broker favourite this week, added 5 at 265p.
A broker's visit to Asda boosted turnover to 20m and the shares firmed 1 3/4
to 66 1/4 p.
Turnover in Tate &amp; Lyle swelled to 10m after two agency crosses. The shares
eased a penny to 393p. Dalgety forged ahead 20 to 518p on talk of a strong
recommendation from Strauss Turnbull.
The strong trend in both the UK and French stock markets gave impetus to the
recovery in Euro Disney shares, which finished 20 higher at 665p. Channel
tunnel operator Eurotunnel was also helped by the same sentiment, finishing
13 ahead at 466p.
Bellwinch ended 6 dearer at 40p in response to a buy recommendation from
Credit Lyonnais Laing, its broker, ahead of results due next Tuesday.
Shares in high street retailer WH Smith surged forward after the company
reported annual profits at the top end of expectations and also raised the
dividend payment.
The WH Smith 'A' stock rose 16 to 471p as 4.1m shares were traded. Mr Tony
Shiret at BZW was among brokers who upgraded current year estimates, lifting
his forecast by Pounds 5m to Pounds 122m.
WH Smith's good showing helped sentiment in Boots, which put on 6 at 486p.
Profit-taking was blamed for a decline in Kingfisher, 9 cheaper at 669p.
Reports of 'sell' advice from UBS left Ladbroke 3 lighter at 205p. Rentokil
Group encountered demand ahead of today's interim figures, firming 4 to
210p.
A positive recommendation from Kleinwort Benson was said to have continued
to fuel an advance by Inchcape, which added 13 at 567p.
The 'light' end of the building materials sector provided a firm feature in
Wolseley, which appreciated 10 more to 654p, still boosted by a series of
recent buy recommendations from building analysts, notably from Carr Kitcat
&amp; Aitken.
Mr Lawrence Ambolt at Carr said: 'In a highly rated sector, Wolseley
represents good value - particularly when compared with other distributors,
none of which have Wolseley's track record, nor, we would argue, its
prospects or management strength.'
Pilkington came in for sustained buying interest, the ordinary shares moving
forward 4 to 158p and the warrants 2 1/2 to 56 1/2 p.
Among housebuilders, Barratt advanced 5 to 161p, Wilson Bowden 11 to 439p
and Wilson Connolly 8 to 192p. Alfred McAlpine, scheduled to report interims
today, was 8 higher at 215p.

FT  26 AUG 93 / China, Pakistan hit by US sanctions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US yesterday imposed economic sanctions on China and Pakistan, claiming
they dealt in sensitive missile technology in violation of international
arms controls.
Mr Mike McCurry, the State Department spokesman, said the US would prohibit
sales of munitions and sensitive technology - that with both military and
civilian uses - to both countries for two years.
In the case of China, US companies will be denied export licences for sales
to or contracts with 10 Chinese entities, including the ministry of
aerospace industry and the ministry of defence. Only new sales and contracts
will be affected.
The sanctions are expected to have little impact on Pakistan which is not a
big consumer of such US products. Officials said they were reviewing how the
law would apply to the purchase of spare parts and maintenance contracts on
F-16 jet fighters bought from the US.
The decision is expected to cost US companies Dollars 400m to Dollars 500m
(Pounds 338m) in lost sales. Asked if American companies would be protected
against their losses, Mr McCurry said: 'No. That's a significant cost that
we pay but it reflects the seriousness with which we look at the issue of
nuclear proliferation.'
Yesterday's announcement followed months of disagreement among US
intelligence agencies about whether China was shipping components of the
M-11 missile to Pakistan in violation of the International Missile
Technology Control Regime.
This week the agencies said they had reached a consensus that the sales had
taken place. M-11 missiles can be equipped with nuclear warheads and have a
range of nearly 300 miles.
Under US law, the administration is required to impose sanctions for
breaches of the missile control regime. The severity of the sanctions
depends on the gravity of the violation.
President Bill Clinton has vowed to take a strong line regarding China and
weapons proliferation. By choosing not to retaliate against Chinese exports
to the US, he has probably contained the dispute, which might have grown to
include a Chinese embargo against US agriculture and other low technology
products.
China has consistently denied making illicit sales. Pakistan yesterday also
denied that its purchases had broken US rules.
The foreign ministry said Pakistan had acquired only 'some short-range
missiles' from China after being attacked by Soviet-made scud missiles from
Afghanistan in the late 1980s. 'Concern for missile proliferation does not
arise from Pakistan but from India's extensive missile development
programme, including the Prithvi and Agni missile systems,' an official
said.

FT  26 AUG 93 / International Company News: Parts makers feel effect of
German motor crisis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE EFFECTS of the crisis in the German motor industry showed up yesterday
in poor first-half results at two leading parts suppliers. VDO Adolf
Schindling, part of the Mannesmann group, recorded a loss, while Varta, the
battery maker, saw net earnings shrink 75 per cent to DM5m (Dollars 2.9m).
VDO said first-half sales had fallen 1.3 per cent to DM1.17bn, despite a 27
per cent rise in foreign turnover. Unofficial estimates put the loss at
around DM50m.
The group said it expected a deficit for the full year after a 15 per cent
fall in turnover, although 1994 should show a marked improvement.
It blamed the poor performance on lower volumes, price pressure and
restructuring costs. Numbers employed fell by more than 800, and a further
1,000 German jobs are scheduled to go by April next year.
Meanwhile, VDO is continuing to shift capacity abroad. Current projects
include a possible joint venture in China. Works will be opened soon in
South Africa and Indonesia, and negotiations are under way for a plant in
the Czech Republic.
Fichtel &amp; Sachs, another Mannesmann components maker, reported mounting
losses earlier this week. Its deficit rose to DM98m during 1992, compared
with a loss of DM68m a year earlier.
New orders in the early months of the current year were stubbornly low, and
the company suggested losses could increase again.
Varta, a leading supplier of car batteries, said half of its 8 per cent fall
in first-half turnover to DM1bn was a result of currency fluctuations.
Recession had hit industrial sales, with car battery turnover dropping 13
per cent to DM363m. Turnover from power units for portable appliances was
unchanged at DM403m.
In the year to the end of June the company had cut its payroll by 8 per cent
and reduced capital expenditure by 22 per cent.
On the basis of 'modest' prospects for the rest of the year Varta said
full-year earnings would be significantly lower than last year's DM50m.

   WARSAW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NESTLE, the international confectionery and foods company, has offered to
pay Dollars 40m for an 80 per cent share in Poland's last state-owned
chocolate producer.
Nestle's move, which includes a promise to invest a further Dollars 30m in
the Goplana plant in Poznan, is designed to block the establishment of a
joint venture between the state and E. D. &amp; F. Man, the UK sugar and cocoa
broker.
This venture, which is awaiting a go-ahead from Mr Janusz Lewandowski, the
privatisation minister, would see E. D. &amp; F. Man putting in Dollars 37.5m
with the state contributing the Goplana plant. This would leave both sides
with 47 per cent of the equity. The balance would be owned by the Goplana
workforce.
E. D. &amp; F. Man and Elite Industries formed a joint marketing company with
Goplana in 1991, designed to smooth the way for the merger.

FT  26 AUG 93 / Romania tiptoes along reform path: Privatisation has got off
to a slow start
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE and VIRGINIA MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ROMANIA'S official privatisation programme has only just completed its pilot
phase two years after enactment of the privatisation law. State companies
which dominate the economy and which have accumulated an inter-enterprise
debt of about 1,900bn Lei (Dollars 2.3bn), equivalent to about 20 per cent
of GDP, remain untouched.
The fact that many large state enterprises are resisting reform has raised
suspicions they are doing so with the sympathy, if not the support, of
senior members of the government.
The lack of political will to implement the privatisation programme and
reform the state sector is a reason the government has been unable to sign a
1993 stand-by agreement with the International Monetary Fund. A successful
outcome to the talks would have unlocked Dollars 3bn in aid pledged by G24
countries.
Formal barriers to speedier structural reform and privatisation, such as the
lack of a bankruptcy law and capital markets, still exist. But Romanian
officials involved in the reform process cite a variety of informal
barriers.
Until recently, for example, the five directors of the State Ownership Fund
(Sof), the body charged with valuing, restructuring and selling 6,200
companies by the year 2000, had to make do with sharing a single room.
The Sof still has a staff of less than 100 operating out of a dingy
Bucharest office building, having been rebuffed in its attempts to find more
suitable accommodation in ministry premises.
The delays to the official privatisation programme have not, however,
prevented state property from finding its way into private hands. Directors
and officials of state enterprises are barred from buying assets of state
companies which can be sold at official auctions.
But 'spontaneous' privatisations, whereby state assets are sold cheaply to
private companies in which officials or their relations have an interest, is
common, according to reformers.
Mr Paul Miercan, general manager of the Sof, conceded that it was 'very
difficult' to stop the 'moral degradation' taking place during Romania's
patchy transition to a market economy. The scale of the problem is
impossible to quantify, but he acknowledged that out of 72 companies sold by
the Fund by mid-July, there were 'upwards of 20 cases' where irregularities
were confirmed.
Mr Aurelian Dochia, president of the National Agency for Privatisation, says
the phenomenon of 'spontaneous' privatisation is 'one of the most important
arguments' in favour of moving as quickly as possible in selling off the
state companies. 'The substance of the state sector is being sucked into the
private sector,' he says, 'with the possibility that only empty shells will
remain.'
Romania's fledgling class of private entrepreneurs complain that government
policies encourage the inefficiency of the state sector at the expense of
the country's overall economic health.
Private companies say they cannot raise capital for new projects but that
state banks, which handle 90 per cent of loans, are still lending to heavily
indebted firms.
With little pressure on state company managers to be profitable, they have
not felt compelled to contract out work to new private businesses or to
lease surplus production facilities or property.
But statistical and anecdotal evidence suggests all is not gloomy for
private businesses. Mr Mike Hicks, the Bucharest representative of the
European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, believes the momentum
towards a market economy is unstoppable.
'Two years ago we were desperate to get involved with private sector
projects, now we can't keep up with those being put forward.'
Official figures to the end of June recorded 266,061 companies with private
capital and 207,846 private entrepreneurs, a common structure for farmers
who have benefited from the return of collectivised land.
The private sector accounted for 40 per cent of retail sales in the first
half of the year compared with 7.1 per cent in the same period in 1991. It
also accounted for 44 per cent of services compared with 6.5 per cent in
1991.
While statistics indicate that GDP in 1992 was less than Dollars 600 per
head, officials acknowledge that there is a large black economy. The central
bank believes the black market is driven by some Dollars 1bn in hard
currency cash equivalent to 25-30 per cent of GDP. 'There is public
discontent that some people are getting rich unfairly through corruption and
deceit,' says Dr Petre Datculescu of Irsop, a Bucharest polling
organisation.
Yet Irsop surveys also show consistent public support for privatisation, and
an acceptance of the social inequality which comes with a market economy,
though about 25 per cent oppose market reforms.
Mr Misu Negritoiu, deputy prime minister in charge of reform, believes some
opposition comes from a lack of transparency and valuation problems in the
privatisation process. 'Once we open mass privatisation and establish a
transparent procedure, maybe the attitude of the population will change,' he
says.

FT  26 AUG 93 / Yeltsin seeks to heal Katyn wounds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BOBINSKI
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WARSAW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Boris Yeltsin yesterday became the first Russian leader to lay a
wreath at a monument to 20,000 Polish officers and civilians murdered in
1940 by the Soviet secret police.
Relatives of the victims praised Mr Yeltsin for the gesture intended to heal
wounds over the massacre at Katyn forest near Smolensk. Until 1990 Moscow
blamed their deaths on the Germans. Polish officers and civilians, interned
in 1939 in the Soviet Union, were murdered on Stalin's orders. The site of
the monument in a wooded Warsaw cemetery was long regarded by Poles as the
symbolic grave of the men murdered at Katyn and elsewhere.
However, the relatives urged Russia to release all documents about the crime
and to build a cemetery for the victims.
Earlier Mr Yeltsin told Mr Lech Walesa, the Polish president, that the
Russians would bring forward the withdrawal of 1,000 troops stationed in
Poland by three months to the end of October.
The two leaders also signed a trade agreement regulating customs procedures
and comitting both countries to Gatt rules. Last year Poland had a Dollars
640m trade deficit with Russia. The first half of this year saw Poland's
deficit narrow to Dollars 94m.
The talks have, however, left unresolved the question of debts expressed
both in the now defunct 'convertible' rouble and US dollars.

FT  26 AUG 93 / London Stock Exchange: Deal welcomed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The market was cheered by confirmation that building products and printing
company MB-Caradon is to acquire RTZ's building and electrical subsidiary
Pillar, in a much-heralded Pounds 800m deal.
As widely predicted, the acquisition is to be partly funded by a
one-for-four rights issue at 260p, to raise Pounds 334m, with the rest of
the payment coming from Caradon's existing cash pile.
Market watchers have been waiting to see how the proceeds of last April's
sale of Caradon's 25.3 per cent stake in Carnaud Metalbox would be used,
with many urging the company to cheaply acquire assets. Researchers of the
sector said the deal meets that requirement and the shares jumped 32 to a
day's peak of 344p in hectic trading, before surrendering some of the
advance on profit-taking. The stock finished a net 24 ahead at 336p, with
volume reaching 6.8m shares, more than double the daily average.
Having released bumper interim figures at the same time, analysts tinkered
with full year estimates for 1993 but moved to sharply upgrade 1994 profits
forecasts substantially. Mr Howard Seymour at BZW raised his prediction by
Pounds 70m, to Pounds 210m, and forecast that earnings per share would rise
to 20.4p from a previous estimate of 16.7p.
International mining and metals group RTZ moved forward 10 to 712p in trade
of 3m shares.

FT  26 AUG 93 / London Stock Exchange: Oil issues extend recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN OIL sector that has doggedly underperformed the market in the past month
built convincingly on Tuesday's better performance as Wall Street continued
to move to record levels.
Sizeable US buying overnight filtered through into London at the outset of
trading yesterday, driving share prices sharply higher as marketmakers,
already keenly aware of a growing stock shortage in London, began to chase
stock prices higher in an attempt to cut their trading positions.
This only exacerbated a situation which became increasingly difficult in the
afternoon session when one of the US investment banks was seen aggressively
bidding for stock in the oil majors.
Talk of events in Nigeria possibly driving crude oil prices higher were
ignored by London oil sector specialists, who said the upsurge in share
prices was down to three reasons: a stock shortage; the strength of the
dollar; and Wall Street's latest move to record levels. There was no real
boost to share prices from crude prices, which were barely changed on the
day.
British Petroleum surged ahead in the wake of the aggressive US buying,
closing 12 higher at 317 1/2 p with turnover expanding to 9.9m shares. Shell
Transport climbed 11 to 671 1/2 p on 4.1m traded.

FT  26 AUG 93 / London Stock Exchange: Footsie at peak as US buyers return
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LONDON stocks were quick to follow the lead from across the Atlantic
yesterday and, encouraged also by optimism in Germany ahead of this
morning's meeting at the Bundesbank, the FT-SE 100 Index rose nearly 30
points to a new closing peak of 3,079.2.
US buyers appeared again in strength towards the London close, when Wall
Street was extending its move into record territory and the US dollar was
moving higher. They picked up shares in the leading oil and pharmaceutical
companies, as well as, more selectively, across the broader range of the
London market.
Impressed by predictions from leading banking economists in Germany that the
Bundesbank will cut its key discount rate today, UK analysts sounded more
confident on the timing of rate cuts in Europe. The mood in London was
summed up by one leading strategist who commented yesterday: 'If they (the
Bundesbank) do not act today, they will sooner or later, so the timing is
not so compellingly significant.'
Dealers stressed that the chief impetus behind the renewed advance in
equities had been the reappearance of the US buyers who helped drive the
Footsie above the 3,000 mark two weeks ago. Heavy sales of mutual funds in
the US, with particular success for funds aimed at investment in the UK and
other European stock markets, have underpinned confidence that US investors
are returning to equity investment in strength.
The FT-SE Mid 250 Index also rose to a new peak yesterday, gaining 21.4 to
3,495.6. The strong rise in the UK stock market's two most widely quoted
measuring rods was also underlined by high trading volume in equities, with
non-Footsie stocks making up around 58 per cent of the day's Seaq total of
731.8m shares. On Tuesday, Seaq volume of 539.4m shares represented Pounds
1.25bn in retail, or customer, business, a return to the average daily
totals established over the past twelve months.
Equities opened higher on the back of Wall Street's move overnight to an
all-time peak and found additional encouragement from increased activity in
the derivatives market.
At the day's best, the Footsie reached 3,081.8, within 8 points of the intra
day peak reached on Aug 19. Marketmakers again found themselves very short
of stock because fund managers instantly cancelled any selling orders
previously placed with stockbrokers.
'You dare not sell anything on a day like this because it will cost you dear
to try and buy it back an hour later,' said one dealer. Pressures were
particularly harsh in the oil share sector which bore the full weight of US
buying and dollar pressures.
Equity market market confidence brushed aside the widely-expected rights
issue from MB-Caradon, which came in at Pounds 334m, and also a Pounds 500m
Eurosterling bond from BT.
Dealers ascribed the renewed advance in the market to a continuation of the
same bullish arguments which have driven UK stocks ahead since the beginning
of the month; a perception of low inflation, falling interest rates and a
recovery, albeit slow, in the domestic economy.
On this basis, London will pay close attention to Wall Street's performance
overnight as well as to the outcome of today's meeting of the Bundesbank
policy council.

FT  26 AUG 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUSINESS in the UK derivatives area increased smartly yesterday as markets
respon-ded to predictions from German economists of a cut in the
Bundesbank's discount rate today, writes Terry Byland.
The September future contract on the FT-SE 100 re-established a good premium
of around 10 points against cash, trading at 3,097 at best. At the close the
contract stood at 3,080, a premium of 9 against cash and about 3 above
estimated fair value - the quotation on the contract which allows for
carrying costs and dividend payments on the underlying stocks. However,
interest cooled off after the Bundesbank said it planned no press conference
for today.
More significantly, volume increased to 10,488 lots in the September
contract, compared with under 6,000 on Tuesday and below 7,000 on Monday.
The picture was the same in traded options, where volume jumped to 37,622
contracts from Tuesday's 22,382. Both the FT-SE 100 option (8,442) and the
Euro FT-SE option (2,919) saw increased interest.
Among individual stock options, oils were active, with Lasmo (2,390) still
very busy as the underlying stock con-tinued to trade heavily on hints of a
shake-up in the industry. But the most active spot was taken by Amstrad, the
consumer electronics company, with 2,510 contracts dealt. Glaxo, the subject
of US interest again, had 1,842 lots traded.

FT  26 AUG 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Airlines meet demand as Dow
peaks again
</HEADLINE>

Wall Street
MOST US stock markets advanced further into record territory yesterday amid
futures-related buying and continued strong demand for airline issues,
writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close, all but one of the major indices were at record highs,
although off their best levels of the day. The Dow Jones Industrial Average
gained 13.13 at 3,652.09. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was 0.36 firmer at
460.13 and the American SE composite up 1.22 at 454.42. The exception was
the Nasdaq composite, which slipped 1.48 on profit-taking to 733.66. Trading
volume on the New York SE totalled 301.6m shares.
Low interest rates, the lack of alternative attractive investments, and
slowly building confidence in the economic outlook have been cited as the
main factors behind the markets' recent record-breaking run. That run showed
no sign of faltering yesterday, as heavy buying of stock futures and
sustained demand for cyclical and other economically sensitive stocks
continued to push share prices to new highs.
Investor sentiment is so strong, in fact, that it can brush off seemingly
bad economic news, such as yesterday's 3.8 per cent decline in July durable
goods orders. That headline number, however, was not as bad as it looked,
because the decline was entirely the result of lower aircraft orders:
excluding the transportation component, orders actually rose last month.
Investors were also cheered by good news from the housing market, where
existing home sales rose 5.4 per cent in July.
Airline shares were in demand after securities house First Boston raised its
rating for Delta Air Lines from a 'hold' to a 'buy'. Delta climbed Dollars 2
1/4 to Dollars 55 1/4 . AMR, parent of American Airlines, rose Dollars 1 3/4
to Dollars 67 5/8 , USAir Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 16 and UAL Dollars 2 3/4
to Dollars 149 1/8 .
Cyclicals opened firmer, but ended mixed. Ford was up Dollars  1/8 at
Dollars 51 7/8 , General Motors closed steady at Dollars 46 3/4 and Chrysler
eased Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 41 7/8 . Caterpillar, which led the market
higher on Tuesday, added Dollars  1/8 at Dollars 82 1/2 , while General
Electric firmed Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 99 and Minnesota Mining &amp;
Manufacturing put on Dollars  7/8 at Dollars 108 1/8 .
Philip Morris was a notably poor performer, dropping Dollars 2 1/4 to
Dollars 48 7/8 in volume of 7.5m shares after broking house Smith Barney
Shearson lowered its rating on the stock from 'outperform' to 'neutral'
because of the company's failure to increase its dividend.
Toys R Us rose Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 36 3/4 in busy trading on press
reports that the company plans to open Books R Us departments in its main
toy stores following the success of a pilot scheme.
Bell Atlantic advanced Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 60 3/4 on news that a
federal court had ruled that the company can enter the video-programming
business.
Canada
THE Toronto market finally topped the 1987 all-time high, ending with a
modest gain after fairly heavy trading. The TSE 300 index was up 10.7 at
4,122.9, surpassing the previous closing record of 4,112.8 registered on
August 13, 1987.
Volume came to 62.3m shares valued at CDollars 621m and rises led declines
by 402 to 334.

THE downwards drift in gold shares on the back of a weaker bullion price
deepened near the close, but industrials held on to small gains. The golds
index lost 32 to 1,756 while industrials rose 7 to 4,624. The overall index
shed 6 to 4,045.

FT  26 AUG 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Paris opens new account in
high spirits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ATTENTION focused even more firmly on today's Bundesbank meeting, writes Our
Markets Staff.
PARIS started the new account in high spirits with a 1.7 per cent rise in
the CAC-40 index, up 35.91 to 2,159.31.
Turnover remained solid at FFr3.9bn. The last trading account had seen very
heavy turnover, with a daily average of FFr4.3bn, swelling to a record
FFr11.5bn on July 31, the day after the crisis in the ERM was triggered.
During the August account the CAC-40 index gained 6.5 per cent.
Societe Generale was one of the most active stocks, assisted by its
successful placing of 1.8m shares in Alcatel Cable, which crossed the market
in early trading at FFr600 a share. The placing was equivalent to about 4
per cent of Alcatel Alsthom's holding in the company, now around 77 per
cent.
SocGen closed up FFr17 at FFr642, Alcatel Alsthom rose FFr13 to FFr735 and
Alcatel Cable lost FFr13 to FFr606.
Havas, up FFr12.40 at FFr467.20, attracted attention on reports that it
might raise its stake in Canal Plus, the television group, whose shares
advanced FFr4 to FFr1,267, but off the day's high of FFr1,284.
Euro Disney remained in the news with suggestions in the US that a new
investor might come forward. The theme park's shares gained FFr1.50 to
FFr57.50.
FRANKFURT firmed as favourable inflation data from two west German states
lifted the domestic bond market, and enhanced interest rate hopes. The DAX
index rose 20.09 to 1,917.78, as turnover rose from DM6.2bn to DM6.6bn.
Among blue chips, MAN, the truckmaker and engineering group, rose DM10.50 to
DM332 after a two-day fall of DM9.50 on poor half-year results earlier this
week. Mr Nigel Longley, an institutional adviser with Commerzbank, said that
some traders were taking the view that all of the bad news was out of the
way.
Daimler gained DM9.30 to DM731.80 on the additional 14,000 job cuts at
Mercedes, analysts reworking 1994 earnings forecasts ahead of the 1993
half-year results.
Meanwhile, Commerzbank showed a relative fall, unchanged at DM315.50
following a warning by Moody's late on Tuesday that it was reviewing the
large German bank for a possible downgrade on its debt rating.
AMSTERDAM noted some positive rises in most internationals, helped by Wall
Street's record close on Tuesday. The CBS Tendency index put on 1.2 at
129.0.
The publishing sector again featured, with Wolters Kluwer, popular since its
good first half profits on Tuesday, adding Fl 1.50 to Fl 100.50, up some 25
per cent this year.
Gist Brocades, the biotechnology group, built on Tuesday's advance after
releasing satisfactory first half figures, the shares rising Fl 1.60 to Fl
49.20. Pakhoed, the storage and transport group which is due to release
first half figures today, was quoted 30 cents higher at Fl 44.10.
MADRID gained from an extended rally in the bond market, and on interest
rate hopes as the general index, 3.97 higher at 297.81, registered its
second consecutive high for the year. Turnover shot up from Pta24.7bn to
Pta34.5bn.
Interest rate-sensitive companies, such as banks and electricity utilities,
were among the main winners, Argentaria putting on Pta130 to Pta6,000 and
Endesa Pta170 to Pta5,360.
ZURICH saw foreign buying in blue chips as the SMI index closed 30.0 higher
at 2,502.4. Nestle benefited with a SFr17 rise to SFr1,117.
In banks, SBC rose SFr9 to SFr497 ahead of next week's results; and a higher
dollar lent support to pharmaceuticals, where Ciba-Geigy certificates put on
SFr9 to SFr707.
MILAN remained fairly strong with foreign activity noted particularly in the
banking sector, as well as in some other stocks which have underperformed
the market recently.
The Comit index finished up 1.57 at 617.25, although more than two hours was
lost due to a technical failure in the electronic dealing system.
Among the banks, Mediobanca was one of the day's best performers, putting on
L553 or 3 per cent to L17,965.
OSLO featured a 5 per cent gain in shipping stocks as the All-share index
rose 10.35 to 568.9. HELSINKI saw an 11.4 per cent drop in the bank shares
index, and profit-taking was blamed as the Hex index fell 34.7, or 2.4 per
cent to 1,416.0.

FT  26 AUG 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Trading concentrates on
telecoms as Nikkei rises
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ARBITRAGE-linked trading dominated activity and share prices followed the
futures market, closing higher in thin volume, writes Emiko Terazono in
Tokyo.
The Nikkei average gained 89.61 at 20,521.45, finishing above the 20,500
level for the first time since August 16. The index fluctuated between
20,542.35 and 20,412.24 on technical trading as most investors remained on
the sidelines.
Volume was 200m shares, against 172m on Tuesday, as advances led declines by
553 to 368, with 231 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section
stocks rose 6.96 to 1,649.27 and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index firmed
1.91 to 1,261.40.
Some investors were wary ahead of the last trading day for August delivery
today. Many market participants were also discouraged by the June diffusion
index, the leading indicator for the economy, which fell below the critical
50 per cent level for the second consecutive month.
Trading concentrated on telecommunication-related issues following the
successful auction on Tuesday for DDI, a new long distance telecom company.
The public offer price, the weighted average of the successful auction bids,
was fixed at Y3.7m.
Short-term trading of DDI related issues is expected to heighten ahead of
DDI's listing on the TSE's second section on September 3. Kyocera, DDI's
leading shareholder, moved forward Y20 to Y6,180.
Dealers bought Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, which rose Y5,000 to
Y938,000, while Fujitsu put on Y11 at Y791.
Banks were higher on bargain hunting. The sector had lost ground following
the yen's rise, which had depressed hopes of a cut in the official discount
rate. Industrial Bank of Japan advanced Y50 to Y3,390 and Mitsubishi Bank
appreciated Y50 to Y2,900.
Housing-related shares were bought on reports that interest rates on housing
loans will fall in October following the cuts in short and long-term prime
lending rates by commercial banks. Mitsui Fudosan improved Y10 to Y1,320 and
Daikyo Y30 to Y1,290.
In Osaka, the OSE average ended 71.64 higher at 22,459.27 in volume of 39.1m
shares. Nintendo, the video game maker, advanced Y240 to Y10,100.
Roundup
WALL STREET'S overnight gains did relatively little for the Pacific Rim.
AUSTRALIA crept lower, the All Ordinaries index finishing 1.6 off at 1,922.6
as turnover rose from ADollars 408m to ADollars 434m.
News Corp slipped 13 cents to ADollars 9.32 as its 72 per cent jump in net
profits was described as below expectations. Caltex Australia, the petroleum
refiner and marketer, closed 13 cents ahead at ADollars 2.59 after its
half-year results pleased oil analysts.
NEW ZEALAND saw another big business but the NZSE-40 index subsided by 18.79
to 1,984.08 as investor worries about industrial relations at Telecom, and
profit-taking in Brierley, weakened the two key stocks. Telecom receded 9
cents to NZDollars 3.97 and Brierley dipped 5 cents to NZDollars 1.15.
Turnover came to NZDollars 68m.
HONG KONG fell on worse than expected profits for airline Cathay Pacific,
weakness in property shares, and fut-ures linked trade. The Hang Seng index
shed 62.10 to 7,265.58 in its fourth straight decline.
Cathay's 46 per cent drop in first-half profits left it 40 cents lower at
HKDollars 10. Among properties, Sun Hung Kai Properties lost HKDollars 1.25
at HKDollars 36.25 after Tuesday's major bank decision to tighten mortgage
lending.
SEOUL's composite index fell a further 9.93 to 705.10, investors staying
away as brokers said economic fundamentals were weak. Turnover shrank from
Won298bn to Won253bn.
KARACHI finished lower on selling by short-term operators and the absence of
institutional buying, the KSE index sliding 14.31 to 1,325.35.
SINGAPORE approached its all-time high again, the Straits Times Industrial
index ending 21.22 up at 1,976.09. Kay Hian James Capel rose sharply on
expectation that the stock-broker will do better in the second half, after a
very good set of interim results, as the market's bull run continues: the
registered shares added 11 cents at SDollars 1.61.
KUALA LUMPUR was mixed but property issue Lion Land saw strong afternoon
buying on renewed talk of a timber deal. The KLSE composite index edged up
0.25 to 805.72 as Lion climbed 58 cents to MDollars 4.12 in 18.4m volume on
a strong rumour linking it with Sabah Forest.
BANGKOK advanced on late buying of banks and small finance companies, the
SET index finishing 8.50 ahead at 952.33 in turnover up from Bt5bn to
Bt5.4bn. JAKARTA hit another year's high as the JKSE index rose 4.86 to
398.49 on strength in the banking and manufacturing sectors.

FT  26 AUG 93 / World Stock Markets: Foreign investors return to Indian
equities - The market's recent rally
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By R C MURTHY and STEFAN WAGSTYL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BOMBAY, NEW DELHI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Almost a year after winning permission to invest in Indian stock markets,
foreign fund managers have started to put serious money into equities.
In the past six weeks, about Dollars 450m in foreign institutional funds has
flowed into Indian equities, Dollars 300m of it in the past two weeks. The
inflow has triggered the sharpest rally in the market since last year's
financial scandal involving banks and brokers brought the 1991-92 bull run
to an end.
From the end of July to last weekend, the BSE index rose 27.5 per cent.
Earlier this week stock prices began to slip back on profit-taking, and
yesterday fell 3 per cent to 2,655 on reports that forward trading in shares
might be banned.
However, while the market was one of the world's best emerging market
performers last week with a 10 per cent advance in dollar terms, according
to data supplied by the IFC, an affiliate of the World Bank, it remains
barely changed on the year to date.
Nevertheless, there is no mistaking the change in mood: the financial
scandal is now seen as a thing of the past.
Furthermore, foreign and domestic investors seem more confident than they
were even three months ago about the country's economic outlook.
The turning point was the defeat on July 28 of a no-confidence motion in the
government of Mr PV Narasimha Rao, the prime minister, who was under
pressure from his political opponents to refute allegations that he received
money from Mr Harshad Mehta, a broker deeply embroiled in last year's
scandal. Investors breathed a sigh of relief as the threat to political
stability disappeared, at least temporarily.
They also welcomed signs of improved performance in the Indian economy,
especially a sharp increase in exports which closed the trade deficit in the
first three months of the current financial year (April-June 1993) to just
Dollars 300m, down from Dollars 1.6bn a year ago.
The monsoon rains, crucial to India's agrarian-based economy, have also been
good in most parts of the country.
The rise in equities has been accompanied by a five-fold increase in daily
turnover in the past month - from Rs800m to Rs4bn (Dollars 25m to Dollars
127m). Brokers say this indicates the rally is broadly based and involves a
large number of investors.
Brokers in Bombay suggest that a major reason for the upsurge in foreign
inward investment is a growing fear among international investors that the
Chinese economy may be overheating. For investors seeking to place funds in
a large developing country, India is an alternative to China, they say.
However, Marlin Partners, a Bombay investment company, warns that the rally
may not last because further price increases would rapidly trigger a surge
in primary issues.

FT  26 AUG 93 / Foreign Exchanges: DM weaker on inflation news
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE D-Mark weakened against most European currencies and the US dollar
yesterday after data from several German states suggested that the country's
August inflation figure would be flat, writes James Blitz.
Coming the day before the Bundesbank council meeting, the better than
expected inflation data were bound to depress the D-Mark. Expectations were
already high for a  1/4 percentage point cut in the discount rate, currently
at 6.75 per cent. Yesterday, some analysts were talking of 1/2 percentage
point reduction, with inflation looking as though it would fall on an
annualised basis in August from 4.3 per cent to 4.1 per cent.
The major winners from the inflation news were the French franc and Danish
krone, with a dealer at one of the leading London counterparties saying he
had seen very strong selling of the 'Mark/Paris' cross rate. The French
currency finished at FFr3.472 per D-Mark, after a previous close of
FFr3.481. The krone ended at around DKr4.085, having been at DKr4.11 at the
start of the day.
The dollar gained nearly a pfennig against the D-Mark in the wake of the
German inflation news, closing at DM1.6880. This was in spite of a sharper
than expected fall in July's US durable goods orders by 3.8 per cent, the
fourth monthly decline in the past five months. In New York the dollar eased
back to end at DM1.6840.
The pound fell back 1 1/2 pfennigs against the D-Mark, amid signs that
investors were selling UK government bonds. The currency closed at DM2.5025.
Rumours that the Danish authorities were selling sterling to buy Danish
krone also helped to depress the British currency.
The most surprising move among European currencies yesterday was in the
Belgian franc, which dropped sharply against the D-Mark, from BFr21.02 to
around BFr21.16. It later closed at BFr21.12.
The main trigger for the move was a report that 14 Flemish economists had
said that continuing to tie the Belgian franc to the D-Mark would damage
industry and employment prospects and was no longer an acceptable option.
The Belgian central bank leapt to the currency's defence, saying that policy
would be unchanged. But Mr Mark Austin, treasury economist at Midland Global
Markets, said it was striking that the Belgian currency had suffered so
badly on a day when most of Europe had performed well against the D-Mark.
The yen continued to weaken against the dollar, a process helped by
extremely heavy intervention from the Bank of Japan at the Y104.00 level.
Some dealers said they had not been expecting intervention until the
currency got to Y103.00. In London, the dollar closed at Y104.9 from a
previous Y103.7. It finished at Y105.0 in New York. There was a growing
feeling among dealers that the currency might not break through the Y100
level for some time, if at all.

FT  26 AUG 93 / Money Markets: New hopes on rates
</HEADLINE>

EXPECTATIONS that the Bundesbank would cut its discount rate at today's
council meeting strengthened yesterday after the latest German inflation
data were lower than the market had expected, writes James Blitz.
The market appears to expect that the discount rate will be reduced by 1/2
percentage point today, from its current level of 6.75 per cent. However,
there were fewer expectations that the central bank would call for a cut in
the repo rate at next week's money market tender, preferring to keep it at
around 6.80 per cent for 14-day funds.
Expectations of a cut in the discount rate floor were strengthened by
inflation figures for most of the German states which suggested that
annualised inflation will be at 4.1 per cent in August, down from 4.3 per
cent in July.
This news helped to lift sentiment in the German cash and futures markets.
The Bundesbank will probably heed the fact that five-year bunds also rallied
on the news, closing about 40 ticks up.
It was striking that 100 per cent of bids for funds were accepted by the
Bundesbank in its weekly tender yesterday, but that only DM90.3bn was added.
This was some DM10bn below expectations. Mr Adrian James, an economist at
NatWest Markets, said this suggested that banks were holding back on bids,
expecting easier borrowing conditions through a cheaper discount window.
The low level of bids left dealers scrambling for funds at one stage, and
call money was as high as 7.0 per cent.
Euromark futures were up on the inflation news, reflecting expectations of
lower rates. The December contract rose 7 basis points to 94.10.
Better sentiment in Germany fed through to the French sector, where Pibor
contracts were also higher. September finished 3 basis points higher at
93.20 and December was up 6 at 94.33. French policy continues to give the
impres-sion that rates will only be reduced if the Bundesbank eases first.
Sterling markets were mostly unaffected by the news in Europe, although the
September short sterling contract closed 2 basis points firmer at 94.18.
Three-month sterling cash was again unchanged at 5 7/8 per cent on the bid
side. There was a daily shortage of Pounds 600m in the discount market,
which was swiftly despatched.

The recent grip on the London Metal Exchange COPPER market by influential
traders was not so evident yesterday and prices staged a downward
correction. The cash premium over three months metal also eased back from
above the Dollars 40 level it reached on Tuesday. The three months position
closed at Dollars 1,937.50 a tonne, shedding Dollars 9 of Tuesday's Dollars
33 advance, while the cash premium closed in to Dollars 32.50 a tonne. The
ZINC market continued Tuesday's late fall with the three months price
dipping to Dollars 885 a tone at one point. But it steadied on profit-taking
to end the after hours trading session at Dollars 889 a tonne, down Dollars
9 on the day. TIN prices fell back to the 20-year lows ruling before the
recent spike and traders said the market was just reflecting the depressed
fundamental situation, which had not changed. At the London bullion market
there was another attempt to push the GOLD price through support at Dollars
370 a troy ounce just after the New York opening, but again professionals
supported the market. PALLADIUM's recent decline accelerated, taking the
price to Dollars 128.75 an ounce at the afternoon fix, the lowest since the
end of June.

FT  26 AUG 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: German farmers feel 'green'
currency pinch - How the virtual collapse of the ERM has hit incomes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GERMAN FARMERS are calling for emergency action by the European Commission
because of the threat to their prices caused by the virtual collapse of the
European Community's Exchange Rate Mechanism earlier this month.
'Any further price changes are going to hit us very hard because we've
already seen lower prices to farmers from reform of the CAP while we're
paying more for our raw materials since our inflation rate is the highest in
the EC,' Mr Max Zurek, chief economist at the German farmers' union, said
yesterday.
The farmers are also protesting against the automatic changes in the 'green'
currency rates - in line with real exchange rate fluctuations - that have
applied to some currencies since the beginning of the year, but which now
apply to all of them. 'It makes it very difficult for farmers to plan
ahead,' Mr Zurek said. 'They have to keep revising contract prices.'
Mr Jochen Borchert, Germany's agriculture minister, is pushing for a special
meeting of EC farm ministers in the first week of September to discuss the
green currency system through which EC price support is channeled to
farmers. Mr Borchert has already visited his Dutch and French opposite
numbers this week to gauge support.
EC farmers have been protected from any real drop in farm prices resulting
from currency changes since the complex 'switchover' mechanism was
introduced 9 years ago at the insistence of the Germans.
EC support prices to farmers are set in European currency units, which
represent a basket of currencies. The Ecu prices must be converted into
countries' own currencies at an exchange rate - either fixed or floating.
The switchover mechanism is a complex process for converting Ecus into
'green' Ecus, which effectively makes the Deutschemark the strongest
currency in the basket. German farmers have been protected by this system
from any cut in farm prices that would follow a revaluation of the
Deutschemark in the ERM.
The switchover system was set up to insulate German farmers from any cut in
prices - it has kept their support prices steady in D-Marks. But it has also
benefited farmers across the EC who have seen prices 20 per cent higher than
they would otherwise have been.
The mechanism proved costly to run - it cost the EC an additional Ecu1.5bn
(Pounds 1.14bn) last year. By keeping German prices stable and pushing all
other prices upwards, the switchover mechanism had an in-built inflationary
bias.
The commission tried to get rid of the switchover at the beginning of the
year because of the introduction of the single market, but the German farm
lobby ensured that it remained in place.
Since the switchover was triggered by a revaluation within the narrow band
of the ERM - a political decision in the semi-fixed exchange rate system -
it is now defunct as currencies are allowed to fluctuate widely. The Germans
want it applied again to floating currencies, but the commission is not
keen. 'The commission has now achieved through the action of the finance
ministers what it could find no consensus for among agriculture ministers
last year,' said Mr Zurek.
However, although the switchover is now inoperative, German farmers have not
yet seen any cut in prices. What they have seen is the drop in the value of
the Franc and the Danish Krone resulting in more French and Danish farm
products on the German market, which in turn is pushing German prices down.
UK farmers have seen their farm exports become more attractive and their own
support prices rise by about 15 per cent since the UK left the ERM last
September. The small devaluation for France and Denmark has pushed up
support prices marginally to French and Danish farmers.
But German, Dutch and possibly Belgian farmers fear their prices will fall
if the D-Mark continues strong enough to force a revaluation.
That is why farmers claim there must be swift emergency action to remove the
threat of price cuts. Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany is expected to
address the issue in talks with Mr Eduard Balladur, prime minister of
France, this week.
But calls for far-reaching reforms of the EC 'green' money system are
unlikely to be supported by many other countries. The UK would strongly
resist the return to a switchover mechanism.
'German farmers may not like it, but for the first time, they are in the
same position as all other farmers in the EC,' one UK farming official said.

FT  26 AUG 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Talks fail to resolve fishing
row between Iceland and Norway
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EMERGENCY TALKS between Norway and Iceland aimed at defusing a bitter
fishing row centred on cod stocks in the Barents Sea have ended without
resolution.
The purpose of the meetings was to seek agreement on the principles of
management of resources with regard to the UN conference on stock management
outside coastal state's economic zones and to achieve bi-lateral agreement
between the two countries on fishing in the Barents Sea.
Iceland is now threatening to expand fishing operations to the Norwegian
economic zone off the Arctic island of Svalbard and still refuses to
acknowledge that Norway has any right to claim jurisdiction over resources
in the disputed area.
The week-old dispute involves Icelanders fishing in the 'loophole', a 62,400
sq km zone in the Barents Sea managed jointly by Norway and Russia, where
Arctic cod spawn before making their way into those two countries' waters.
Mr Johan Joergan Holst, Norway's foreign minister, failed to obtain
agreement from Mr Jon Baldvin Hannibalsson, his Icelandic counter-part, on
the UN principle that the authority of the coastal state to manage marine
resources outside its economic zone applies to the Norwegian-Russian Barents
Sea 'loophole' region.
At a UN conference earlier this month Iceland was one of the strongest
proponents of this principle but refused to agree to it in the dispute with
Norway over Barents Sea resources.
Norwegian foreign ministry officials said yesterday that the meetings, which
were held on neutral ground in Stockholm and also attended by the two
countries' fisheries ministers, were to have covered 'only' the issue of the
UN conference but that Iceland had demanded quotas from Norway for fishing
in the Barents Sea.
Iceland also threatened to fish in Norway's economic zone off Svalbard,
after having just a week ago asked their fisherman to avoid the area.
The Stockholm meetings ended bitterly with both country's four ministers
leaving hastily without giving a promised media briefing on the outcome of
the discussions. Norwegian officials said no new meetings on the dispute
were planned but that Norway would at any time welcome a reopening of the
discussions.
Norway refuses to yield to Iceland's demands for fishing quotas in the
Barents Sea - possibly influenced by the public opinion costs this would
entail in an election year - and will continue to step up surveillance of
the disputed 'loophole' area as long as Icelandic fisherman continue to defy
its demands.

THE UNITED Nations says a locust invasion of vast desert lands in Pakistan
and India is a 'time bomb' it is trying to prevent from exploding across the
region, reports Reuter from Islamabad.
The locust outbreak could start a cycle of plague lasting several years if
it is not stopped, according to a statement from the UN information office
in Islamabad. It quotes a UN Food and Agriculture Organisation report as
saying locusts on both sides of the India-Pakistan border threaten all
agricultural production in the region. 'International donors have been
requested to provide equipment and chemicals for use by the Plant Protection
Department of Pakistan,' it says, adding that similar assistance is being
provided in India.
'A major outbreak of desert locusts is occurring in the deserts of Sind and
Punjab in Pakistan and cross-border in India,' the FAO says. 'After invading
the area in the middle of July by flying across the Arabian Sea from Yemen
and Oman, the insects now extend throughout vast areas of desert.'

FT  26 AUG 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Sahel's crops at mercy of
airborne invaders - Defences against the locust threat remain woefully
inadequate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CANUTE JAMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE ARE strong signs that another desert locust plague is about to hit
Sahelian Africa, and according to a recently-published report, unless a
comprehensive approach to the problem is implemented the region's already
struggling agriculture will be further devastated.
'Events in late 1992 and early 1993 in East Africa suggested that a desert
locust plague could once more be brewing, starting in the Red Sea hills of
Sudan, Eritrea and Saudi Arabia,' says the report by the Panos Institute of
London. It refers to warnings from the Food and Agriculture Organisation
that there is need for better quality information from surveys if the
impending plague is not to be as damaging as the last in 1986-1988.
The painful irony for Sahelian farmers is that while drought destroys the
prospects of improved agricultural production, it is also unfavourable to
the breeding and proliferation of the desert locust. The report says it was
the good rains of 1985 that seem to have stimulated the increased breeding
which triggered the 1986-1988 plague.
'So just when there is a year or two of improved rainfall and the prospect
of better yields, the threat of locust damages increases,' the report says.
'Many a Sahelian farmer has suffered seeing the first crop after years of
poor rains being ravaged by locusts and grasshoppers.'
Any attempt to deal with the problem must first come to terms with the fact
that it is not only locusts, but grasshoppers, which threaten agriculture in
the region. The Panos Institute points out that while locusts are notorious
for their capacity for destruction, grasshoppers have no such notoriety. It
argues, however, that this distinction is 'false'.
'While grasshoppers may not have caught the imagination of chroniclers of
plagues as locusts have, they too devastate crops and rangeland. In fact,
over the last five years they have caused more damage in the Sahel than
locusts.'
The experience of the 1986-1988 plague indicated that the fast action and
flexibility needed to deal with the pests were not available, and that once
the locusts were on the move the resources supplied to combat their
onslaught was sometimes inappropriate and often came too late.
The fight to reduce the locust population and to prevent a plague, or to
contain them when they are on the move, is severely hampered by poor
communications in the Sahel. It is more difficult to fly to different areas
from within the region than it is to reach them from Europe, the Panos
Institute says, and moving equipment, fuel and pesticides in the region is
far from easy.
'A drum of pesticide to be used in August has to be moved up country by May
at the latest,' it says. 'This means it has to be in the country no later
than April, which in turn means being despatched from its country of origin
in January. Yet firm predictions on campaign requirements eight months ahead
are impossible.'
Few Sahelian national budgets can stand the cost of aerial surveys and
efforts at locust and grasshopper control in the region are complicated by
difficulties in regional co-operation, while collaboration among
institutions in the region has become more difficult because of conflict
between or within countries.
The report cites the case of Chad, which it says contains areas of suitable
breeding ground for the desert locust that are too large to be covered by
ground surveys. In 1987 and 1988 the continuing conflict with Libya meant
that aerial surveying in the north was forbidden. In October 1990, poor
relations between Chad and Sudan prevented aerial surveying of large areas
on both sides of their common border.
Dealing with the problem demands the establishment of a 'single
comprehensive and authoritative starting point' for all those concerned with
grasshopper and locust control, the report argues. 'The cost of pulling
together the relevant information is insignificant. While a number of
information networks exits, the FAO remains the best forum for the exchange
of ideas between scientists, administrators and decision makers.'
While donor countries and institutions and Sahelian plant protection
agencies are becoming increasingly aware that there is a need for new
approaches, the Panos Institute warns that another plague on the scale of
that of 1986-1988 could as easily build up.
'Luck may not be on the Sahel's side this time,' it concludes. 'If technical
and institutional capacities are not strengthened and if more sustainable
strategies are not developed, the farmers of the Sahel will continue to be
vulnerable to devastating crop losses.'

FINLAND HAS unveiled proposals for supporting its Arctic and sub-Arctic
agriculture within the European Community - seen as the most difficult issue
in the country's membership talks, reports Reuter from Helsinki.
'Unless we get some so-called Nordic agricultural support we cannot continue
agriculture in this country,' Mr Pertti Salolainen, the foreign trade
minister, told a news conference here yesterday.
Mr Heikki Haavisto, the foreign minister, said the measures Finland would
propose in the talks would cost between FM6bn and FM9bn (Pounds 693m and
Pounds 1.04bn) a year. He said Finland's goal was for the EC to contribute
FM3bn to FM3.5bn a year.
A package of measures outlining Finland's position includes the following:
Average support of up to FM2,970 per hectare;
Livestock support of up to FM4,800 per animal;
Milk, beef and mutton production subsidies for the two most northern
regions;
Transport support for milk, meat and eggs (excluding the most southern parts
of Finland);
Animal feed support in the three most northern regions.
Finland would also aim at a 12-year transition period to restructure its
farming.
The government said price and support levels within the EC's common
agricultural policy were not enough for Finland to achieve the agricultural
policy objectives of the community.
Finland has a growing season of 180 days or less compared with 220-230 days
in Denmark and more in southern Europe.
The package is to be sent to the EC in September to form a basis for further
negotiations.
The present round of talks started in February. The country aims to become a
member of the community in 1995.

CARIBBEAN SUGAR exporters to the US will earn about USDollars 19m less from
deliveries made in the 1993-1994 period, following a reduction in import
quotas by the US government. Industry officials in the region say its
cumulative quota for the delivery period, staring in October, is 16 per cent
less, in line with an overall reduction in imports by the US government.
The region's quota will be 225,508 tonnes, with the Dominican Republic, the
region's largest quota holder, supplying about three quarters. The country
will earn about Dollars 14.5m less because of the quota reduction, the
officials say. Other suppliers in the region are Barbados, Belize, Guyana,
Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago.
The US pays quota holders about 20 cents a lb, and the quotas are
periodically reviewed by the US Department of Agriculture to determine what
quantity of imports are needed to supplement domestic production.
US import quotas have been progressively reduced over the past decade,
cutting the earnings of regional producers. The Caribbean industry relies on
preferential markets such as those in the US and Europe, because world
market prices are lower than the cost of production in the region's
inefficient sugar sector.
In its latest annual report, the Caribbean Development Bank, based in
Barbados, said that quota reductions by the US meant that the region was
selling increased quantities of sugar on the world market 'at prices which
are substantially below the preferential prices for sales to Europe and the
United States'.

The Australian wool market has continued to decline, with the market
indicator down to 411 cents a kilogram on August 25, compared with 430 cents
a week before. The low point in April was 381 cents. Business and buying
interest remains low. There is no doubt that uncertainties on stockpile
disposal policy raised by the Garnaut wool review committee have helped to
check buying interest. Caution seems particularly evident in Japan, normally
a leading buyer at Australian sales.

FT  26 AUG 93 / Government Bonds: European sectors rally sharply on rate cut
hopes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
GROWING expectations that Germany will cut its key interest rate today
helped all the main European government bond markets to rally sharply.
Confidence in a move by the Bundesbank grew as a survey of 12 German
economists showed that the majority expect the discount rate, which sets the
floor for German interest rates, to fall by half a point to 6 1/4 per cent.
This compares with a consensus in the UK of a quarter point cut, dealers
said.
Also, the latest German regional inflation data showed that price rises in
western Germany were slowing down.
However, yesterday's Bundesbank repo was carried out at an unchanged 6.80
per cent rate and one economist said: 'All things being equal, the
Bundesbank has no more reason to cut this time than last time.'
At the last council meeting before the summer recess a discount rate
reduction had been widely flagged, but only the Lombard rate, which sets the
ceiling for lending, was altered.
Another economist argued that the traditional refusal of the Bundesbank to
bow to market pressures made it even less likely to ease by a half point
following the economists' forecast. On balance, the rate-cut logic would not
go away and bund futures on Liffe gained 36 basis points to end at 97.52.
FRENCH government bonds surged ahead yesterday with the futures contract
breaking through several support levels to record a gain of 66 basis points
at 122.94.
The rally was led by the futures with heavy turnover of 140,000 contracts.
The bullish tone was reinforced by a purchase of 10,000 call options, a
bullish trade which gives the investor the right but not the obligation to
buy at a fixed price and time.
Dealers said much of the rise was technical with stop-loss buying triggered
at certain points and the 'feel-good' effect of the market deterring any
sellers.
IN THE UK, concerns of a significant shift of assets away from the gilts
market faded as long-dated paper responded to the rate cut euphoria.
Most dealers had heard strong rumours that Middle Eastern investors were
taking profits on Tuesday. The rumours prompted a number of traders to take
short positions, but as the speculation lost ground, books were squared and
prices squeezed higher in a thin market.
Long gilt futures for September recovered nearly half a point to close at
112 7/8 .
HIGH-yielding markets, which have greater room for interest rate manoeuvre
in the event of a German cut, were particularly strong yesterday.
Spanish debt prices received additional impetus from the encouraging wage
negotiation talks between the government and unions. Also the Spanish peseta
broke through Pta80 against the D-Mark. Italian government bonds also rose
sharply with the futures contract lifting more than a point to 113.44.
AFTER a mixed morning, US Treasury prices posted solid gains across the
board yesterday afternoon following a successful five-year auction.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  11/32 at 101,
yielding 6.169 per cent. At the short end, the two-year note was up  1/8 at
100 1/32 , to yield 3.842 per cent.
Prices rose in early trading on the news that durable goods orders fell 3.8
per cent in July. The gains, however, were short-lived when traders realised
that the decline in orders was entirely due to a fall in the always volatile
aircraft sales component. Excluding transportation orders, durable goods
orders actually rose 1.3 per cent in July.
While the long end languished, the short end picked up ground on speculation
that the Federal Reserve was buying two-year, three-year and five-year notes
for the Bank of Japan.
Later in the day, after a brief dip on comments from a senior Fed official
that was interpreted as a sign that monetary policy would not be eased any
time soon, intermediate and long end bonds rallied.

FT  26 AUG 93 / International Capital Markets: KOP offers Dollars 100m in
notes as part of recapitalisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
KANSALLIS-Osake-Pankke, the leading Finnish bank, said yesterday it was
issuing perpetual subordinated notes worth Dollars 100m in international
markets as part of its bid to recapitalise following a period of heavy
losses without falling back on direct government aid.
KOP said the issue, the latest move in a programme to raise about FM4bn from
share and bond issues, was being made without recourse to government
guarantees which the Helsinki authorities last week agreed in principle to
make available to KOP and Unitas, Finland's second-largest bank.
The new KOP notes have a maturity of 50 years and carry a coupon of two
points above the London interbank offered rate (Libor) until the fifth year,
when the coupon will rise to Libor plus 3.5 points. The issue is being lead
managed by Salomon Brothers International.
KOP is, in effect, paying a premium for the notes by not making use of the
government guarantee. But the bank said the price was reasonable given the
guarantee fees it avoided and the importance to KOP of remaining
independent.
The bank last week announced an international share issue of up to FM1bn to
add to the FM1bn already raised from a share issue earlier this year. It has
also raised FM250m in an earlier bond issue and intends to raise a total of
FM2bn in bonds.
KOP, which last year took up a FM1.7bn injection from the state in
preference capital, believes it can maintain a capital adequacy ratio of 10
or 11 per cent - above the 8 per cent international minimum - without
further recourse to government aid despite not anticipating a return to
profit until 1995.

SUMITOMO Trust &amp; Banking will apply to set up a securities dealing
subsidiary this autumn, Reuter reports from Tokyo.
The bank said in March that the subsidiary was likely to be capitalised at
around Y10bn. This level of capital looks set to rise since Sumitomo plans
to let the unit engage in government bond trading.
Financial reforms allowing banks and brokerages to enter each other's turf
through subsidiaries took effect in April.
So far, Industrial Bank of Japan, Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan and
Norinchukin Bank, the main agricultural co-operative bank, have set up
securities arms.
Sumitomo Trust and Mitsubishi Trust &amp; Banking have said they would join the
business in 1993-1994.
Japan's big commercial banks are not allowed to set up securities
subsidiaries before next July.

TURKEY'S Capital Markets Board (SPK) is to allow equity-based mutual funds
to be floated on the Istanbul Stock Exchange, Reuter reports from Istanbul.
Mr Caner Ertuna, SPK's deputy head, said the decree allowed for the
establishment of index-based mutual funds with an obligation to invest at
least 95 per cent of their portfolio in shares making up the ISE index.
Turkish equity funds now total more than TL3,000bn.
Mr Ertuna said: 'The new regulations will play an important role to develop
financial markets and benefit more efficiently from these markets in
privatisation. A parallel market will develop and the government will be
able to sell a larger portion of its shares to these funds.'
The recent implementation of tax advantages to mutual funds had unleashed a
flurry of new fund issues.

FT  26 AUG 93 / International Bonds: BT issue injects liquidity to
Eurosterling's long end
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Telecommunications yesterday returned to the international bond
market after a three-year absence, and its Pounds 500m issue of 10-year
Eurobonds injected badly-needed liquidity into the long end of the
Eurosterling market.
Corporate yield spreads have tightened substantially since the start of this
year because demand for long-dated, non-government sterling paper has far
outstripped supply.
According to SG Warburg Securities' corporate unsecured index, the spread
over gilts for maturities of 10 years or more has fallen from 153 basis
points at the end of 1992 to around 90 basis points.
As a result of the lack of supply, many of the sterling Eurobond issues
launched earlier this year have become illiquid and are trading at a large
premium to par.
But the joint lead manager, SG Warburg, said that BT's bonds should keep
their liquidity because of the large size of the issue.
The bonds, which carry a coupon of 7 1/8 per cent, were priced to yield 18
basis points over the 8 per cent gilt due 2003. When they were freed to
trade the spread tightened to 15 basis points. The all-in cost of the
unswapped deal to the issuer was 23 basis points over gilts.
Treasury officials at BT said the proceeds of the issue would be used for
general corporate funding. BT, which repaid over Pounds 1bn of its debt last
year to bring its gearing below 20 per cent, has Pounds 800m worth of
scheduled repayments over the next two years.
Meanwhile, syndicate managers are waiting for the World Bank to decide who
will lead its next global dollar bond. The World Bank said that the winners
of the mandate were likely to be announced early next week.
The offering is expected to raise Dollars 1.25bn and have a maturity of 10
years. The World Bank said that discussions on the spread over US Treasuries
had ranged from 10 to 17 basis points. Some syndicate managers expect the
issue to be priced at a spread of 14 to 16 basis points.
The Eurodollar sector was active across the yield curve, as more borrowers
took advantage of the continued demand for dollar-denominated paper.
At the short end, Finland's Dollars 250m offering of three-year Eurobonds
offered further evidence that investors were looking more favourably on
Scandinavian borrowers.
The bonds were priced to yield 28 basis points over underlying US
Treasuries.
At the long end, Bellsouth Telecommunications raised Dollars 300m through an
offering of 15-year Eurobonds which syndicate managers said was fairly
priced at 50 basis points over the 5 3/4 per cent US Treasury due 2003.

FT  26 AUG 93 / International Company News: Provisions bring sharp
first-half fall at BNP
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BANQUE Nationale de Paris, one of France's biggest banks which is scheduled
for privatisation this autumn, suffered a sharp fall in first-half net
profits to FFr522m (Dollars 88.6m) from FFr1.33bn in the same period last
year.
News of the profits fall, which reflects a steep increase in the group's
provisions, comes on the eve of BNP's forthcoming share issue. The French
government last month chose BNP and Rhone-Poulenc, the chemicals company, as
its first targets for privatisation. It is expected to decide by the end of
next month which will be the first to be sold.
Mr Michel Pebereau, whom the government appointed as chairman of BNP in May
to spearhead the privatisation, earlier this summer warned that the group
would report a steep fall in interim profits.
The scale of the fall was in line with Mr Pebereau's forecast, but BNP fared
better than expected in lifting first-half net banking income by 9 per cent
to FFr21.23bn, from FFr19.48bn in the same period last year. It had
anticipated a rise of 6 per cent.
Group costs rose to FFr14.35bn from FFr13.88bn over the same period and
operating profits increased to FFr6.88bn from FFr5.61bn. However, the group
was forced to raise provisions to FFr5.82bn from FFr4.11bn due to the impact
of the French recession on its smaller corporate customers and the need to
make writedowns on its sovereign loans.
Mr Pebereau is expected next month to present a new group strategy to
employees in the approach to the privatisation programme.
BNP has started to prepare for its move into the private sector by taking
full control of Financiere BNP, a holding company with a 20 per cent stake
in Union des Assurances de Paris (UAP), the largest French insurance group.
BNP has agreed to buy the remaining 49.9 per cent stake in Financiere BNP
from the French government.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
READER'S Digest Association, the New York-based publisher of books,
magazines and other products, yesterday disappointed investors by reporting
only a 2 per cent gain in underlying net income for the fourth quarter.
The result reflected the continued weakness of its US books and home
entertainment business. And Wall Street reacted by marking down the
company's shares by Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 38 7/8 by the close on the New
York Stock Exchange.
Net income for the quarter ended June edged higher to Dollars 26.8m, or 23
cents a share, on revenues of Dollars 644.4m. The result compares with net
income of Dollars 26.2m, or 22 cents, and Dollars 605.4m in revenues in the
year-earlier quarter.
When restated to reflect changes in accounting for post retirement benefit,
net income for the 1993 period was Dollars 25.8m, or 22 cents.
International revenues in the 1993 period showed a solid 11 per cent
increase, and would have been 17 per cent higher without adverse exchange
rate movements. However, US revenues were unchanged from the year-earlier
period.
Mr George Grune, chairman, said the company had made some progress in
restoring the books and home entertainment division to its historic level of
growth, but warned that it may require 12 to 24 months to complete the
process.
For the full year, the company posted a 12 per cent gain in underlying net
income.
A strong performance in overseas markets also was largely responsible for
the yearly advance.
Revenues in the US increased only slightly, with the domestic books and home
entertainment segment turning in weaker sales on the year.

JOHN FAIRFAX, the Australian newspaper group, reports a net profit for the
year to June of ADollars 67.2m, (USDollars 45.4m), its first as a stock
market listed entity.
The company, which has operated in its current form since coming out of
receivership in late 1991, lifted revenue by 5.6 per cent to ADollars 770.1m
and has declared a maiden dividend of 4.5 cents a share.
Net earnings, as stated under Australian stock exchange rules, more than
quadrupled from ADollars 15.4m, but the directors warn the comparison is not
meaningful because of the high level of debt in the previous period.
That debt was restructured when the present company was created,
substantially reducing interest expense. The directors say earnings before
interest and tax - up 30.4 per cent to ADollars 168.0m - make a better
comparison.
The higher revenue was derived from an increase of ADollars 28.1m in
advertising and a ADollars 14.6m rise in circulation.
Fairfax, in which Mr Conrad Black's Hollinger group has a 25 per cent stake,
publishes the Sydney Morning Herald, Melbourne's The Age newspaper and the
national Australian Financial Review.

THOMSON-CSF, the French defence electronics group and Aerospatiale, the
French aircraft manufacturer, are negotiating an alliance between their
joint avionics operation and the commercial avionics business of Allied
Signal of the US.
A joint venture between Sextant Avionics and Allied Signal would create one
of the world's largest aircraft electronics groups with annual sales of
about Dollars 1bn. The restructuring of Sextant also involves a public offer
for the 47.6 per cent of the shares not owned by Thomson-CSF and
Aerospatiale.
The two companies are offering minority shareholders FFr300 per share.
Sextant's quotation was suspended two weeks ago when the share price was
FFr250.
Should the public offer be successful, Thomson-CSF would take 66.6 per cent
of the shares in Sextant and the rest would be held by Aerospatiale.
A spokesman for Thomson-CSF said that the restructuring of Sextant reflected
the difficulties encountered by the group as a result of the depressed
defence and commercial aviation markets. The avionics company has not paid a
dividend for two years.
Sextant said in a statement that a if joint venture was agreed with Allied
Signal, it would be be finalised by the end of the year.

AVESTA Sheffield, the Anglo-Swedish stainless steel producer, yesterday
disclosed a second-quarter profit of SKr9m (Dollars 1.12m), a strong
turnround on the SKr53m loss for the first three months, writes Christopher
Brown-Humes.
The group attributed the better performance to improved productivity, rather
than to a market upturn. It did not provide comparative figures as it was
only formed through the merger of Avesta and British Steel Stainless last
November.
First-half sales were SKr7.14bn, against SKr11.8bn for all 1992. Operating
profit was SKr142m, compared with a SKr180m loss for all 1992.
Lower financial expenses left the group with a loss after financial items of
SKr44m after including a negative SKr49m adjustment for changes in inventory
values.

SANDVIK, the Swedish engineering group, boosted first-half profits by 10 per
cent to SKr994m (Dollars 123.5m) as a sharp rise at its steel division
offset continued weak demand. It said it remained on course to increase 1993
profits above last year's SKr1.53bn, writes Christopher Brown-Humes in
Stockholm.
The stronger Swedish krona helped the group lift sales by 25 per cent to
SKr10.7bn, while orders rose 28 per cent to SKr11.3bn.
The group's steel division was the star performer where profits rose to
SKr231m from SKr95m on revenues up 24 per cent to SKr3.25bn.

CATHAY PACIFIC Airways, Swire Pacific's Hong Kong-based international
airline, yesterday revealed first-half 1993 earnings of HKDollars 681m
(USDollars 88m), down 46 per cent from 1992's HKDollars 1.26bn.
The results were significantly below analysts' expectations, with the
airline suffering from the weak performance of its routes to recession-hit
Japan and Europe.
Cathay Pacific was also seriously hit by the cabin attendants' strike during
January, which Mr Peter Sutch, chairman, said had caused an estimated
HKDollars 240m reduction in profits.
Revenues of HKDollars 11bn were marginally up on the previous year. The
interim dividend is being held at 10.5 cents a share.
Mr Sutch said: 'Although the full year's results are expected to be
materially lower than 1992, we expect that the second half-year's results
will not show a percentage drop as great as indicated for the first half
year.'
Asia's airlines had previously shown themselves to be relatively
recession-proof, but with rapidly-increasing capacity and internal
competition, at a time of weak global markets, earnings are finally being
hit.
Mr Sutch said: 'The main cause of the drop in profits was the effect of the
continuing recession in the company's major markets, particularly Japan and
Europe.'
Cathay has suffered the additional disadvantage of Hong Kong's high
inflation; it was the airlines' push to control operating costs, that
ultimately resulted in the flight attendants' strike.
Passengers carried during the first half of the year totalled 4.1m, a rise
of 3 per cent. However, the airline's load factor fell 3 per cent, as a
result of increased capacity from two new aircraft.

FT  26 AUG 93 / International Company News: Strong yen forces Toyota Motor
profits down 24%

TOYOTA MOTOR, Japan's largest carmaker, yesterday announced a 24 per cent
decline in pre-tax profits for the year ended June, and said the yen's
appreciation could threaten its policy of lifetime employment.
In its third consecutive year of profit decline, Toyota pre-tax profits fell
to Y286.4bn (Dollars 2.76bn) and operating profits to Y103.6bn from
Y124.9bn.
The results were the lowest since the Toyota group merged its manufacturing
and sales operations into a single company in 1982. Sales were Y9,031bn, up
from a previous Y8,940bn.
Toyota blamed the downturn on weak domestic demand as well as currency
strength. Earlier this week Honda reported a 42 per cent fall in profits for
its first quarter.
Toyota warned that at an exchange rate of Y110 to the dollar it would be
hard-pressed to make any profit at all. If the exchange rate remained closer
to Y105 to the dollar, Toyota would find itself in a very difficult
situation, the company said.
It added that the outlook was not significantly better. While the
government's economic stimulus package was expected to help lift consumer
demand in Japan, fierce competition and the uncertainty of recovery in world
markets kept a cloud over future prospects, the company said.
In the current year to June 1994, Toyota is forecasting a 30 per cent
decline in pre-tax profits to Y200bn and a 29 per cent fall in net income to
Y110bn on sales 3.7 per cent down at Y8,700bn. These projections are based
on an average exchange rate of Y110 to the dollar, the company said.
Unit sales in Japan suffered a drop of 7.6 per cent to 2.16m units. Exports
in the year rose 1.6 per cent to 1.72m units, largely on increased exports
to Asia. Production of passenger cars and trucks in Japan was down by 4.4
per cent while production overseas increased 20 per cent.
On a consolidated basis, Toyota sales were Y10,210bn and pre-tax profits
were Y322.2bn, down 24.6 per cent.

STORA and MoDo, two of Sweden's top three forest products companies,
yesterday reported improved first-half results despite what they described
as persistent weak demand and prices in their European markets.
Stora, the leading pulp and paper group in Europe, returned to the black,
showing a profit after financial items of SKr30m (Dollars 3.7m) compared
with a loss in the same 1992 period of SKr163m. Sales totalled SKr25.3bn,
compared with SKr24.3bn.
MoDo cut its loss after financial items to SKr353m from SKr518m last year,
on sales of SKr8.4bn (SKr8.2bn), and announced plans for a one-for-two
rights issue in the autumn to raise about SKr1.7bn. This, it said, would
help the company to take advantage of any upturn in the industry.
The turnround at Stora came despite a sharp fall in operating income to
SKr440m from SKr707m. It was attributed to a sharp cut in net financial
expenses, to SKr410m from SKr870m, caused by falling interest rates and a
rise in contributions from the group's financial services unit.
Stora said it had pushed ahead with a heavy rationalisation programme in the
first half, achieving cost reductions of SKr1.3bn as employee numbers fell
to 34,600 compared with 39,800 a year ago. In addition, there were savings
of SKr700m from divestments and volume declines.
But it said the effects of these were disguised in the half-year results by
exchange rate losses of SKr2.8bn, incurred when the costs of foreign units
were translated into the weaker Swedish krona.
Mr Lars-Ake Helgesson, Stora president, said: 'We do not expect any
substantial changes in the market that will effect our result for all of
1993. What we have achieved so far was because of internal actions and lower
interest rates.'
Mr Bernt Lofs, head of MoDo, agreed that the industry continued to suffer
from weak demand, low prices and overcapacity in western Europe. He warned
that MoDo, which pushed up operating profits in the first half to SKr346m
from SKr59m, would incur a further loss in the second half of the year.
But he added that there were signs that the worst of the recession was over.
The planned rights issue, to be priced at SKr120 per share, would give MoDo
the financial strength to take advantage of an upturn. The issue will apply
to existing holders of ordinary shares and convertible participating notes.

PHILIP MORRIS, the food and tobacco group which set off a price war in the
US cigarette industry last April by slashing the price of its Marlboro
brand, yesterday disappointed Wall Street by not increasing its quarterly
dividend.
It declared it would pay its existing 65 cents-a-share dividend to investors
on October 12, dashing analysts' hopes of an increase of up to 7 or 8 per
cent.
Philip Morris shares fell Dollars 3 on the news, to stand at Dollars 48 1/8
in lunchtime trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

<TEXT>
SANDVIK, the Swedish engineering group, boosted first-half profits by 10 per
cent to SKr994m (Dollars 123.5m) as a sharp improvement at its steel
division offset the impact of continued weak demand.
It said it remained on course to increase 1993 profits above last year's
SKr1.53bn.
The stronger Swedish krona helped the group lift sales by 25 per cent to
SKr10.7bn, while orders rose 28 per cent to SKr11.3bn.
Excluding acquisitions and currency movements, sales were 4 per cent lower.
Demand was 'very weak' in Europe, particularly in Germany, and there was
little evidence of recovery in Japan, the company said. However, it noted
relatively strong growth in Australia and Asia and some growth in North
America and most of Latin America.
The star performer was the steel division, where profits rose to SKr231m
from SKr95m on a 24 per cent increase in revenues to SKr3.25bn. The weaker
krona helped the group lift volumes.
The cemented carbide division lifted profits to SKr650m from SKr586m as
sales swelled 34 per cent to SKr5.87bn. But the process systems division
swung to a SKr24m loss from a SKr26m profit.

<TEXT>
AVESTA Sheffield, the Anglo-Swedish stainless steel producer, yesterday
disclosed a second-quarter profit of SKr9m (Dollars 1.12m), a strong
turnround on the SKr53m loss for the first three months.
The group attributed the better performance to improved productivity, rather
than to a market upturn. It did not provide comparative figures as it was
only formed through the merger of Avesta and British Steel Stainless last
November.
First-half sales amounted to SKr7.14bn, against SKr11.8bn for all 1992.
Operating profit after depreciation was SKr142m, compared with a SKr180m
loss for all 1992.
Lower financial expenses left the group with a loss after financial items of
SKr44m after including a negative SKr49m adjustment for changes in inventory
values.
The group said its strong position in the recovering UK and North American
markets should offset weak demand in most of Europe in the second half.
It expects to show a considerable improvement on last year's SKr564m loss.

<TEXT>
JOHN FAIRFAX, the Australian newspaper group, reports a net profit for the
year to June of ADollars 67.2m, (USDollars 45.4m), its first as a stock
market listed entity.
The company, which has operated in its current form since coming out of
receivership in late 1991, lifted revenue by 5.6 per cent to ADollars 770.1m
and has declared a maiden dividend of 4.5 cents a share.
Net earnings, as stated under Australian stock exchange rules, more than
quadrupled from ADollars 15.4m, but the directors warn the comparison is not
meaningful because of the high level of debt carried in the previous period.
That debt was restructured when the present company was created,
substantially reducing interest expense. The directors say earnings before
interest and tax - up 30.4 per cent to ADollars 168.0m - make a better
comparison.
They say the revenue increase was achieved despite low advertising volumes
for the company's major newspapers. The higher revenue was derived from a
ADollars 28.1m advertising increase and a ADollars 14.6m circulation rise.
The company has entered the 1993-94 financial year with classified and
display advertising volumes showing growth. 'This bodes well for the current
year,' say directors.
Management has focused on improvements in efficiency to counter unfavourable
trading conditions. This is reflected in a rise in operating costs, up 0.5
per cent to ADollars 580.6m.
'In particular, the company has addressed its major costs, namely wages and
newsprint. Since June 1992, through early retirements and redundancies, the
equivalent full-time number of employees has been reduced by around 5 per
cent.'
Fairfax, in which Mr Conrad Black's Hollinger group has a 25 per cent stake,
publishes the Sydney Morning Herald, Melbourne's The Age newspaper and the
national Australian Financial Review.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BELL ATLANTIC, the large east coast telecommunications company, won an
important legal victory which could make it the first US local telephone
company offering cable television in its telephone service area.
It said a US district court in Alexandria, Virginia, had declared
unconstitutional a provision in the 1984 Cable Act blocking telephone
companies from providing cable programming in areas where they provide a
telephone service.
The case, which seems likely to go to appeal, sets a legal precedent and may
prompt other local telephone companies to mount similar cases.
Bell Atlantic, one of the seven regional 'Baby Bell' telephone companies
spun off in the mid-1980s from American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, filed suit
last December in Alexandria against the US government agencies responsible
for overseeing the 1984 Act.
It wants initially to offer a cable television service to 60,000 customers
in Alexandria, just across the Potomac River from Washington DC.
The cable industry seems certain to appeal the ruling. The federal
government could also object, although the executive branch has generally
favoured breaking down regulatory barriers.

THE CODAN insurance group, which became Denmark's leading group when it took
over the Hafnia insurance and banking operations earlier this year, made a
first-half net profit of DKr503m (Dollars 72.97m), giving a return on equity
of 22.6 per cent.
The group, which is controlled by the UK's Sun Alliance, did not publish pro
rata figures for the two groups for 1992, when first-half profits (for Codan
only) were DKr49m.
The merger, which took effect from January 1 this year, has tripled group
assets to DKr52.44bn from DKr15.3bn on December 31. Equity capital increased
to DKr4.49bn on June 30 from DKr3.98bn at the end of last year.
Codan made a first half loss of DKr163m before financial income, which came
to DKr704m, while taxes were DKr39m. Earnings by the accident insurance
divisions, where premium income increased to DKr2.47bn from DKr652m last
year, increased to DKr597m from DKr180m, but Codan said the Hafnia accident
insurance business made a loss.

<TEXT>
PRICE WATERHOUSE, one of the world's leading accounting and consultancy
groups, has been banned by the Consob companies and stock market watchdog
from auditing the books of Ferruzzi Finanziaria (Ferfin), Italy's
second-biggest private company.
The ban, which may be extended to Ferfin's Montedison industrial subsidiary,
follows the opening of a formal investigation by Consob into Price
Waterhouse's conduct in auditing the group's accounts.
Consob based its move on the claim that Price Waterhouse had been shown to
be 'technically inadequate' in auditing Ferfin's books. Technical inadequacy
is one of only two grounds on which Consob is allowed to prevent an auditing
firm continuing its task; the other is conflict of interest.
Mr Dino Martinazzoli, a member of Price Waterhouse's Italian partnership,
said the group would probably launch a formal legal appeal against the move,
which is only the second of its kind in recent years. 'The job of auditing
Ferfin's accounts was carried out in a professionally correct way', he said.
Consob's move follows the discovery of severe financial irregularities in
Ferfin's and Montedison's accounts by the new management imposed earlier
this year by the group's leading bank creditors.
The irregularities, which centre on a L435bn additional loss in Montedison's
1992 accounts, are believed to result from attempts to cover up huge US
commodity futures trading losses incurred by Ferfin in 1989, when the group
was run by Mr Raul Gardini.
Ferfin, staggering under total borrowings of L28,838bn (Dollars 18.08bn) at
the end of May, and Montedison were obliged to revise their already high
1992 losses to reflect the new discoveries.
Meanwhile, the new management brought in by the group's leading creditor
banks, commissioned Deloitte &amp; Touche, another big international accounting
group, to carry out a detailed investigation into the groups' accounts.
Shortly afterwards, Price Waterhouse withdrew its certification from the
accounts it had certified only days before.

<TEXT>
CANAL PLUS, one of France's most dynamic television companies, faces an
uncertain future following reports that Havas, the media group which is
already its largest shareholder, plans to raise its stake in an elaborate
share swap deal.
According to the Figaro newspaper, Havas plans to add the 20.4 per cent
stake in Canal Plus now owned by the Compagnie Generale des Eaux industrial
group to its present 23.5 per cent holding. CGE would in return become the
largest shareholder in Havas by raising its holding to 20 per cent.
Meanwhile, Societe Generale, the banking group which is a long-standing
corporate ally of CGE, would exchange its 5.1 per cent stake in Canal Plus
for shares in Havas, where it already holds an 8.1 per cent stake.
Havas declined to comment. Canal Plus said that there was 'nothing to be
said at present'.
Havas would have to wait for changes in French broadcasting legislation to
raise its stake in Canal Plus above the present maximum of 25 per cent. The
French parliament is expected this autumn to start debating a series of
broadcasting reforms.

Gota Bank

<TEXT>
THE SWEDISH government is to provide a further SKr5bn (Dollars 620m)
guarantee for Gota Bank to prevent it from falling below minimum capital
adequacy requirements under the weight of heavy loan losses.
The commitment comes on top of a SKr10bn guarantee which Gota received at
the start of this year after coming under state control at the end of 1992.
It is being made because it has taken longer than originally expected to
return the bank to the private sector and because a change in accounting
treatment inflated its first-half credit losses to SKr7bn. The bank is
expected to be sold during the autumn.
The announcement is a stark reminder that Sweden's banking crisis is far
from over after euphoria at other banks' results and Skandinaviska Enskilda
Banken's move to withdraw a state aid request.
Gota announced a SKr560m operating loss for the first half, after being
dragged into the red by a SKr1.4bn deficit from problem credits housed in
Gota Bank Specialengagemang. It has already used SKr13bn of its SKr15bn
total government guarantee to cover losses.

THE EFFECTS of the crisis in the German motor industry showed up yesterday
in poor first-half results at two leading parts suppliers. VDO Adolf
Schindling, part of the Mannesmann group, recorded a loss, while Varta, the
battery maker, saw net earnings shrink 75 per cent to DM5m (Dollars 2.9m).
VDO said first-half sales had fallen 1.3 per cent to DM1.17bn, despite a 27
per cent rise in foreign turnover. Unofficial estimates put the loss at
around DM50m.
The group said it expected a deficit for the full year after a 15 per cent
fall in turnover, although 1994 should show a marked improvement.
Fichtel &amp; Sachs, another Mannesmann components maker, reported mounting
losses earlier this week. Its deficit rose to DM98m during 1992, compared
with a loss of DM68m a year earlier.
New orders in the early months of the current year were stubbornly low, and
the company suggested losses could increase again.
Varta, a leading supplier of car batteries, said half of its 8 per cent fall
in first-half turnover to DM1bn was a result of currency fluctuations.
Recession had hit industrial sales, with car battery turnover dropping 13
per cent to DM363m. Turnover from power units for portable appliances was
unchanged at DM403m.

FT  26 AUG 93 / International Company News: Finnish insurer improves
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
POHJOLA, the Finnish insurance group, expects an improved 1993 result after
it swung to a first-half operating profit of FM6m (Dollars 1.03m) from a
FM105m loss in the same 1992 period, writes Christopher Brown-Humes.
The group saw investment income rise by FM300m to FM534m, helped by the
strong surge in share prices on the Helsinki stock exchange.
This compensated for a worse underwriting performance, which swung to a
FM104m deficit from a FM79m profit, after losses from credit insurance,
domestic reinsurance and foreign insurance.
Premium income fell 4 per cent to FM2.1bn, largely because of the impact of
the Finnish recession on domestic premiums which were 5 per cent lower at
FM1.8bn.
Rising share prices lifted the group's solvency capital at June 30 to
FM4.4bn, from FM3.7bn at the end of 1992.

completing deal on merger
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RENAULT, the French car and truck manufacturer, and Volvo, its Swedish
partner, are making progress towards the completion of a merger and should
be able to finalise an agreement within weeks, official French sources said
yesterday.
According to these sources, an agreement is possible before the Frankfurt
motor show on September 7 but would depend on the resolution of several
outstanding issues. The issues are believed to include the shareholding
structure of the two groups and the top management structure.
Spokesmen at Renault and Volvo declined to comment on the state of
negotiations between the two groups. The two companies, which have steadily
deepened their alliance since it was initially forged in 1990, have
cross-shareholdings and have set up joint units in areas such as quality
control, component purchasing and product planning.
The French government has been pressing Renault to step up the process of
its merger with Volvo to clear the way for the privatisation of the
state-owned car group. France's ambitious privatisation programme, which
includes the sale of 21 state-owned groups, is due to be launched this
autumn.
Motor analysts said Renault and Volvo might comment on the progress of their
talks when they announce results this week. In line with other European
carmakers, the two groups have suffered from the depressed state of the
market.
Industry analysts are expecting Renault to report pre-tax profits of about
FFr650m (Dollars 110.35m) for the first six months, a sharp fall on the
FFr5.44bn achieved in the same period last year. Sales have also fallen
sharply, although the company has increased market share.
Volvo, meanwhile, is expected today to announce first-half losses after
financial items significantly deeper than last year's SKr103m (Dollars
12.79m) deficit, but with a sharp improvement at the operating level.
Analysts are also predicting a return to profit over the year as a whole
after last year's record SKr4.75bn loss.

<TEXT>
EURO DISNEY, the troubled leisure group, yesterday saw its shares rally
following a report that Walt Disney, the US entertainment company which is
its largest shareholder, is considering bringing in an investor to provide
new capital.
The shares, which have fallen sharply during the past two weeks, ended the
day FFr1.50 higher at FFr57.50 following a report in the Los Angeles Times
quoting Mr Michael Eisner, Walt Disney chairman, as saying that the company
might introduce an external investor.
However, Walt Disney said yesterday that Mr Eisner had been misinterpreted.
'All he said was that we were discussing many things with Euro Disney,' it
claimed.
Analysts were sceptical that Walt Disney would be able to find another
investor willing to take a stake in Euro Disney, given the severity of the
European group's financial problems.
Euro Disney, which has net debt of FFr21bn (Dollars 3.56m), lost FFr1.08bn
in its last financial year to September 30 and is expected to make a net
loss of at least FFr1.8bn this year. It announced last month that it had
been forced to ask Walt Disney for financial support while it attempted to
negotiate an emergency financial restructuring package with its banks.

FT  26 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Weeding out the weakest links in the chain
 -How Boots and WH Smith plan to revamp their lossmaking Do It All DIY
business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'HOW do Do It All do it for what they do it for?' the DIY chain's television
advertisements used to ask.
The answer these days is that they don't. Or rather, for the past year or
so, they have been doing it only at a trading loss, and losing market share
in the process.
Yesterday, WH Smith, which has a 50 per cent stake in the joint venture
along with Boots, said its share of losses for the year to May were Pounds
14.3m, with sales down by 7.3 per cent.
With some justification, Smith can point to the tough trading environment in
the DIY market as an excuse.
After enjoying double-digit profits growth in the late-1980s through rapid
expansion and pushing up gross margins from about 30 per cent to about 34.5
per cent, DIY chains have had a difficult 18 months.
The collapse of the housing market put them under pressure, and a price war
which raged for much of last year damaged both profits and margins.
Despite the difficult conditions, the two largest DIY chains, B&amp;Q and Texas
Homecare, have remained in the black. But Do It All is finding it
increasingly difficult to be number three in the market, and suffers from a
number of internal weaknesses.
The chain was formed in 1990 from the merger of Boots' Payless, acquired as
part of the Pounds 900m takeover of Ward White in 1989, and WH Smith's Do It
All chain.
Profits and margins at both chains had been deteriorating before the merger,
which was supposed to create a large, powerful business that would benefit
from economies of scale. Instead, the new Do It All was hit by a double
whammy.
It was born just as the housing market went into decline, and then, before
it had time properly to integrate the two chains and to establish a coherent
trading formula, it was dragged into the DIY price war.
The result, as one analyst put it, was that 'two small, weak chains merged
to produce a larger weak chain.'
The chain was saddled with some old stores, often in poor locations, and of
widely differing sizes.
Do It All and Payless also had different ranges. These were later
rationalised and standardised, but that led to an increase in items out of
stock, and to confusion, particularly among former Payless customers, about
Do It All's product offer.
Boots and Smith still insist they are committed to turning the business
around. First, a full 'portfolio review' is under way, to determine where
stores need to be closed or relocated.
Distribution is being centralised, which should lead to greater efficiency.
Do It All is also trying to develop the strength and identity of its own
brand.
Mr Steve Russell, Do It All's managing director, is using experience gained
as director of merchandise at Boots to try to improve standards of customer
service.
The chain is also rolling out its 'New Trading Concept', involving refitting
stores and regrouping products according to different DIY projects - for
example, putting everything for bathrooms in one place, rather than taps in
one area and tiles in another.
Specially-designed information boards give advice on how to carry out
various DIY projects.
Refits cost between Pounds 50,000 and Pounds 300,000 depending on the age
and size of store.
Sir Malcolm Field, group managing director, said yesterday percentage sales
increases in refitted stores were 'moving towards double figures', with
sales per square foot 'moving towards Pounds 100', compared with the Pounds
65 per sq ft for the chain as a whole estimated by Verdict, the retail
research group.
But, as Sir Malcolm admitted, the roll-out is slow. Only 54 stores will have
been refitted by next February - out of 220. The pace cannot be quicker, he
says, because 'these are quite big things to do and there is only so much
the infrastructure can take'.
Given that Boots and Smith admit they exacerbated their original problems by
failing to integrate Payless and Do It All quickly enough, the apparent lack
of urgency in refitting the stores is causing nervousness in the City. Some
analysts believe the real reason is the new format has not been as
successful as hoped.
But the question preoccupying most analysts is what happens if the reforms
do not improve trading, and the housing market does not pick up.
Few believe a buyer for the chain could be found, and the cost of closure -
estimated at about Pounds 200m - would be prohibitive.
'I can see no solution to the problem that would satisfy both Boots and
Smiths,' says Mr Nick Bubb, retail analyst at Morgan Stanley.
He draws a parallel with Silo, Dixons' US electrical retailer where losses
are still mounting in spite of management's efforts to improve sales, and
neither sale nor closure is a realistic option.
At least Silo has only one owner. Do It All, on the other hand, looks set to
remain a problem child for both its parents.

FT  26 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Victaulic cites gas factor for drop to
Pounds 5.8m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VICTAULIC blamed reduced demand from British Gas for a 16 per cent decline
in pre-tax profits, from Pounds 6.9m to Pounds 5.8m, in the six months to
June 30 1993.
The company makes pipeline products for the gas, water, and construction
industries.
Total turnover edged ahead to Pounds 51.5m (Pounds 51.2m), but this included
a contribution of Pounds 2.6m from Lindapter, a fixings company acquired
late last year.
Reduced sales of Pounds 48.9m from continuing operations mainly reflected a
fall of Pounds 3m in the gas sector's turnover to Pounds 15m.
The company warned in June that turnover would fall due to lower investment
in pipeline infrastructure at British Gas because of uncertainty created by
the Monopolies and Mergers Commission inquiry.
The MMC report, published on August 17, recommended that British Gas should
retain its ownership of the gas distribution network.
Mr David Stewart, Victaulic's managing director, said yesterday that if the
MMC recommendations were accepted, positive benefits would start to emerge
as the uncertainty surrounding gas distribution faded. But he foresaw no
improvement in British Gas purchases this year, and added: 'Until we know
the government view we are not committing ourselves.'
The company had sought to offset the decline in gas pipeline sales by
boosting exports to Pounds 7.6m (Pounds 4.3m). This had been achieved across
the board, taking advantage of weaker sterling and extra capacity available.
Demand from the water industry was steady, with turnover unchanged at Pounds
22m.
Net interest receivable was nil, compared with Pounds 400,000 in the 1992
first half. The company blamed lower UK interest rates and lower average
cash balances after the Pounds 4.8m acquisition of Lindapter.
Mr Stewart said the company had been earning interest in the UK to offset
interest on Pounds 3.5m of borrowings in Europe. 'When interest rates
reversed we replaced these borrowings,' he said, predicting an improvement
in the second half.
Earnings per share were 8.8p (10.3p) and the interim dividend is maintained
at 2.5p.
The group continued to reduce costs, and working capital had been reduced
from 19 per cent to 16 per cent of sales.
Net cash generated was Pounds 3.3m. Net cash at the bank rose to Pounds 9.6m
(Pounds 6.3m).
The shares, which fell by 20 per cent to 253p on June 17 after the warning
of reduced turnover, closed yesterday up 5p at 301p.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Increased compliance costs meant that Bournemouth Water and West Hampshire
Water, both part of Biwater, the privately owned water engineering company,
turned in pre-tax profits only slightly ahead for the six months ended June
30.
The pre-tax figure at Bournemouth Water - which serves 256,000 people - came
out at Pounds 2.07m, against Pounds 2.06m, on turnover of Pounds 6.07m
(Pounds 5.85m).
Pre-tax profits at West Hampshire Water, which serves 163,000 people, were
helped by reductions in interest payments and emerged at Pounds 684,000
(Pounds 578,000). Turnover was Pounds 4.61m (Pounds 4.25m).
Bournemouth has used up its advance corporation tax surplus, leading to an
increased charge of Pounds 591,000 (Pounds 313,000). Fully diluted earnings
per share came out 17 per cent lower at 115p (138p). The interim dividend is
29p.
West Hampshire continued to use its surplus ACT to arrive at a tax charge of
Pounds 51,000 (Pounds 35,000). fully diluted earnings per share came out at
79p (68p). The interim dividend is 16p.

Net asset value at the Fleming Claverhouse Investment Trust was 193p at June
30, up 14 per cent on the figure of 168.6p at end-June 1992.
Net revenue amounted to Pounds 1.12m, down from Pounds 1.25m in the
comparable period.
Earnings worked through at 2.55p (3.13p) per share.
Comparative figures were adjusted to reflect the change of accounting policy
to recognise income from investments on an ex-dividend basis and the scrip
issue in March.
Dividends of 2.5p have already been announced and the directors expect to
recommend a maintained total of 5.35p.

FT  26 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Losses deepen at Hemingway
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
HEMINGWAY Properties yesterday announced increased pre-tax losses for the
half year to end-June, mainly due to a number of recurring items.
Losses amounted to Pounds 581,000 (Pounds 332,000). Among the exceptional
costs were compensation payments to two former directors amounting to Pounds
110,000.
During June and July a number of transactions were completed, including the
Pounds 30.2m acquisition of a properties portfolio, a Pounds 21.9m placing
and open offer and the Pounds 21.8m cash disposal of Dorset House.
These transactions, the company said, would not have an impact until the
second half.
In addition, prior to the period end, the company disposed of two office
properties for an aggregate Pounds 3.3m.
Net turnover increased from Pounds 3.07m to Pounds 4.58m.
Losses per share were 1.07p (0.61p).
The directors plan to seek shareholders' approval for a reduction in the
share capital to cancel the accumulated deficit on the profit and loss
account to December 31 1993.

FT  26 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Property Trust continues recovery with
Pounds 737,000
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A TURNROUND from pre-tax losses of Pounds 7.95m to profits of Pounds 737,000
was announced by The Property Trust for the year to March 31.
The outcome followed a return to the black in the first half with profits of
Pounds 426,000 against losses of Pounds 6.32m.
The property investment and trading group said the year had been one of
'significant progress', featuring a restructuring involving a capital
reduction, consolidation of shares, introduction to the Official List, and a
fully-subscribed Pounds 2.8m rights issue. As a result, shareholders' funds
improved to Pounds 8.3m (Pounds 4.7m).
Turnover fell from Pounds 9.52m to Pounds 2.48m, but there were operating
profits of Pounds 1.48m, against losses of Pounds 7.26m. There was no tax
and earnings per share emerged at 5.6p (88.1p losses).
The company said the new loan facilities were expected to provide an annual
interest saving of about Pounds 100,000.

FT  26 AUG 93 / UK Company News: CarnaudMetalbox salehits half-year outcome
 -Building a new MB-Caradon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INTERIM RESULTS from MB-Caradon were hit by the sale for Pounds 467m net of
tax and expenses of its 25.3 per cent stake in CarnaudMetalbox in April and
by competitive trading conditions in some of its markets.
However, translation of overseas profits at lower sterling exchange rates
boosted pre-tax profits, which, excluding exceptional items, were 2 per cent
lower at Pounds 59.5m. Operating profits, which ignore the affect of the CMB
sale, rose 20.5 per cent to Pounds 51.2m.
Earnings per share fell from 7.6p to 7.2p, excluding exceptional items,
because of the dilution from the sale of the CMB stake. Including
exceptionals earnings were 24.5p. The interim dividend goes up 3 per cent to
2.83p (2.75p).
The CMB stake contributed Pounds 5.2m (Pounds 20.6m) in associate income
during the half year to end-June, and the proceeds of the sale reversed an
interest charge of Pounds 2.5m to interest receivable of Pounds 3.1m.
It also produced an exceptional profit of Pounds 100.3m, against which a
Pounds 7m provision was set relating to the restructuring of the UK cheque
printing operation.
The group, which is changing its name to Caradon, increased turnover by 13.5
per cent to Pounds 368.4m, including Pounds 2.9m of sales from the US Checks
in the Mail business bought at the end of May.
Turnover from the UK building products division increased 10 per cent to
Pounds 205.4m, with volumes up 11 per cent and prices down 1 per cent.
Operating profits fell 3 per cent to Pounds 17.3m.
Mr Peter Jansen, chief executive, said that pricing was particularly
competitive in bathroom products. He said signs of recovery were mixed but
this was normal at this stage of the cycle and the group was fairly
confident.
Overseas building products, largely continental Europe, increased turnover
by 18 per cent to Pounds 63.4m, but in local currency terms turnover was
static with volumes down 3 per cent and prices up 3 per cent.
Operating profits rose 33 per cent to Pounds 10m, again boosted by currency
translation. Mr Jansen said business on the Continent held up relatively
well, with the German construction industry benefiting from changing social
needs.
Security printing turnover rose 22 per cent to Pounds 99.6m, though in
dollar terms the US business increased sales 1 per cent, with volumes up 5
per cent and prices down 4 per cent. Operating profits were 40 per cent
higher at Pounds 23.9m, including a Pounds 600,000 contribution from Checks
in the Mail.

FT  26 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Bold deal soothes anxious onlookers - Why
RTZ's Pounds 800m disposal solves MB-Caradon's predicament / Building a new
MB-Caradon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE enthusiastic response by the stock market to MB-Caradon's purchase of
RTZ's industrial activities was as much relief at the deals not done as a
welcome for the acquisition.
MB-Caradon was in a tricky situation. In April it raised Pounds 467.5m net
of costs from selling its quarter stake in CarnaudMetalbox, the packaging
group, and the money was burning a hole in its pocket.
With a market capitalisation yesterday morning of Pounds 1.43bn, the CMB
money represented almost a third of MB-Caradon's worth.
With interest rates low, the return on the cash was negligible compared to
what it could be earning if invested in a business. That was bound to
depress the group's current year earnings.
So MB-Caradon needed to put that money back to work as quickly as possible,
and wanted to invest in the area of building products which it regards as
its core.
At the same time, the stock market was pushing up the prices of likely
target companies as it anticipated the effect of recovery on such cyclical
stocks.
The market feared that MB-Caradon's urgent need to invest would draw it into
a hostile bid for a quoted company, and force it to pay well over the odds.
Said one analyst yesterday: 'The RTZ deal is the answer to a maiden's
prayer. As far as buying a quoted company goes, MB-Caradon was left for
dead. The market had pushed up prices, leaving no room for a takeover
premium.'
Another concern was MB-Caradon's earlier intention to expand in European
building materials. With recession still deepening in continental Europe,
but asset prices not yet reflecting that, it would have been just the wrong
time to buy.
The Pounds 800m deal announced yesterday to buy most of RTZ's Pillar group
of industrial businesses is by far the better solution.
It takes MB-Caradon into the North American building products market, and
adds leading brands in the UK, such as MK Electric, Friedland, Catnic and
Duraflex.
The European business is relatively small at 8 per cent of turnover.
The acquisition price might look high at first - the exit p/e on stated
pre-tax profits of Pounds 51.3m is about 24. But that is after Pounds 16.5m
of head office costs - which MB-Caradon might halve - and Pounds 8.6m of
reorganisation costs. Adjusting for those and the pension contribution
MB-Caradon will have to pay, the exit p/e for 1992 might be nearer 19,
somewhat below the building materials sector rating.
Even so, the deal is a bold step. It will double the size of MB-Caradon's
building products operations, and brings in a few businesses about which the
group knows nothing.
But in spite of its short history, MB-Caradon is no stranger to the big
deal. And Mr Peter Jansen, chief executive, and his team have built a
faithful following in the City.
The original business of Caradon was formed in 1985 through a Pounds 61m
management buy-out of the building activities of Reed International, which
was beginning to concentrate on its publishing interests.
Mr Jansen came in as chief executive and Mr Antony Hichens as chairman,
positions they still hold. They had worked together at Redland, the building
materials group.
In 1987 Caradon floated at a market value of Pounds 134.4m and the following
year it acquired Everest double glazing plus its consumer finance business,
also from RTZ, for Pounds 80m.
The next big deal came in 1989 when Caradon reversed into MB Group, which
had just merged its packaging subsidiary into CarnaudMetalbox. MB paid
Pounds 338m for Caradon, but it was soon clear that the Caradon management
would run the show.
The CMB stake always looked out of place, but it was not till this year that
it could be sold for a good price.
Mr Jansen said MB-Caradon first approached RTZ about the Pillar businesses
18 months ago, beginning detailed negotiations once the CMB stake had gone.
The talks must have involved some hard bargaining. RTZ was keen to sell the
whole of the Pillar business, but MB-Caradon only wanted the building
products activities.
In the eventual compromise, MB-Caradon has ended up with businesses making
72 per cent of sales from building products, another 12 per cent from
automotive components, which will fit with MB-Caradon's existing automotive
businesses, and the rest in areas the buyer knows little about but believes
has some value.
The success of the deal depends on MB-Caradon pushing Pillar's margins up to
its own levels.
In 1992, the Pillar businesses being acquired made an operating profit of
Pounds 75.4m on sales of Pounds 981m, a margin of 7.7 per cent.
MB-Caradon's own building products activities had turnover of Pounds 500.8m
and operating profits of Pounds 54.1m, a 10.8 per cent margin.
The particular area of concern must be North America, where turnover of
Pounds 333m from building products in 1992 produced profits of only Pounds
9.5m, a margin of 2.9 per cent.
The hope must be that MB-Caradon can inject its sales and marketing flair
into the RTZ activities. It aims to bring its ideas of branding and
differentiation to the Pillar businesses.
Mr Jansen gave a clue as to what might happen yesterday when he said that
Peachtree, which makes wooden doors and windows in the US, was an upmarket
product with a downmarket sales approach, suggesting that prices could be
pushed higher while quality was emphasised.
With about 13 per cent of the US market for windows and doors, MB-Caradon
reckons that it has a good position to build on.
While Mr Jansen, a Dutchman, still hopes to expand in Europe in the longer
term, in the next couple of years at least, the group will be riding the UK
and US economic cycles and pushing through margin enhancement.
Yesterday analysts were pencilling in a strongly advancing profit and
earnings per share path.
The deal, due to be completed at the end of October, will make little
difference to current year profits, which were already forecast at about
Pounds 125m before exceptionals and tax.
But for 1994, analysts are looking at numbers of about Pounds 200m and
perhaps between Pounds 240m and Pounds 250m for 1995. That suggests a p/e
reducing sharply from the prospective multiple for 1993 of about 22.
From a Pounds 61m mbo to profits of Pounds 250m in 10 years would be an
impressive record, justifying the City's faith in the MB-Caradon team.

FT  26 AUG 93 / UK Company News: RTZ will net some Pounds 900m from Pillar
disposals - Building a new MB-Caradon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RTZ CORPORATION, the world's biggest mining company, will have raised about
Pounds 1.2bn cash from disposals once it banks the money from the sale of
the Pillar businesses. But don't expect it to go on a buying spree.
Mr Bob Wilson, chief executive, said the cash - including Dollars 600m
(Pounds 403m) from the sale of oil, gas and gold assets from the Nerco US
coal company acquired for Dollars 1.1bn earlier this year - would not open
up any new opportunities for RTZ, which was continuously looking for mining
investments around the world.
But these opportunities came along only sporadically and RTZ had no deals
nearing completion in the next few months.
Sir Derek Birkin, RTZ's chairman, said the sale of Pillar 'is consistent
with RTZ's strategy of concentrating solely on our world-class mining assets
where we have strong competitive advantages.'
The deal with MB-Caradon was signed at 7.31am yesterday, after months of
negotiations. MB-Caradon said it first asked RTZ 18 months ago if Pillar
might be for sale and was told it could be at the right price. But
MB-Caradon could not move until it had sold its stake in CarnaudMetalbox, a
process it put in train early this year.
Mr Wilson said MB-Caradon made its approach six months ago, after which RTZ
discreetly canvassed other potential buyers and also considered breaking up
Pillar before deciding on the chosen route. 'We have satisfied ourselves we
got the best-possible deal.'
Earlier this year RTZ sold various smaller Pillar operations, principally
the Skipper vehicle distribution business in the UK, for Pounds 30m.
The remaining Pillar operations suffered 'modest' losses last year, Mr
Wilson said. These are to be disposed of 'as soon as practicable'.
RTZ said that including the earlier sale and on completion of all the Pillar
transactions, together with tax previously provided for, RTZ would realise
about Pounds 900m.
Last year, net earnings of the whole Pillar business were Pounds 20m after
charging Pounds 10m after tax in reorganisation costs.
Once all the Pillar assets are sold RTZ expects to face an exceptional loss
of about Pounds 165m after writing back goodwill - mainly arising from the
1988 acquisition of the minority interests of Indal in Canada - and other
accounting adjustments. RTZ said that, without the write-back of goodwill,
there would have been a profit of about Pounds 245m, representing a 40 per
cent premium on net asset value.
On completion of the sale to MB-Caradon, RTZ's gearing will fall from about
40 per cent to 14 per cent.

INDEPENDENT Newspapers, the Irish publishing group, reported pre-tax profits
doubled to IPounds 14.6m (Pounds 13.6m) for the half year to June 30.
Turnover was up 5 per cent to IPounds 81.5m.
The increase in profits from the previous IPounds 7.01m was primarily due to
an exceptional credit of IPounds 2.65m and a sharp reduction in interest
charges.
The exceptional item represented a gain of IPounds 3.62m resulting from the
disposal of a 2 per cent holding in Mirror Group Newspapers, less redundancy
costs in Irish operations.
Net interest charges fell to IPounds 751,000 as a result of the conversion
to ordinary shares of the 1991 IPounds 30m converible capital bond issue
before the coupon became payable this year. Total shares in issue have
increased from 37m last year to some 68m as a result of the conversion and a
2-for-3 scrip issue earlier this year, and will finally amount to 79m on a
fully diluted basis.
The interim dividend goes up to 4p (3.3p), payable from earnings of 17.9p
(9.7p restated).
Mr Tony O'Reilly, chairman, reported improvements across the group with
increases in advertising market share and higher profit contributions from
national and provincial titles in Ireland.
Australian Provincial Newspapers, in which the group has a 25 per cent
stake, reported a first half pre-tax profit of ADollars 11.6m (Pounds 5.2m),
up from ADollars 5.1m.
Mr O'Reilly said that he anticipates the cable TV subsidiary in Ireland to
have 100,000 subscribers by the year-end, up from 66,000 at the end of 1992.

S DANIELS continued its recovery in the first half to June 30 with pre-tax
profits of Pounds 25,000, compared with a Pounds 105,000 deficit.
This followed progress in the second half of 1992 which resulted in a
reduced loss of Pounds 64,000 for that year.
The importer and distributor for the food industry said the period under
review benefited from its dried fruit activities while the raw materials
business also achieved a satisfactory result.
Mr Paul Daniels, chairman, said the outcome for the six months would have
been considerably better were it not for problems in the confectionery
business in a competitive market.
The company had also moved its focus towards de-veloping its beverage
activi-ties and further investment in production was planned. Options being
considered included a possible factory move.
Turnover improved by 6 per cent to Pounds 16.7m (Pounds 15.7m). Earnings per
share were 0.3p (1.3p losses).

FT  26 AUG 93 / UK Company News: The Telegraph reports 60% rise to Pounds
34.6m - Pounds 6.5m sale and boost from associates help results
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TELEGRAPH newspaper group, which publishes The Daily Telegraph and The
Sunday Telegraph, boosted interim pre-tax profits by 60 per cent and lifted
the dividend by 22 per cent.
The group attributed the rise to strong circulation levels, a satisfactory
advertising performance, and a slight fall in the price of newsprint.
Mr Conrad Black, chairman, said that the directors had had sufficient
confidence in the results to boost the dividend to 5.5p (4.5p) 'despite
inconclusive evidence that the recession is ending'.
Pre-tax profits for the six months to end-June rose to Pounds 34.6m, against
Pounds 21.6m previously, while turnover improved from Pounds 119.9m to
Pounds 128.1m. Earnings per share advanced to 16.6p (11.1p). The shares
closed up 29p to 418p.
At the operating level profits rose from Pounds 19.1m to Pounds 23.8m.
Included in the pre-tax figure was Pounds 6.5m from the sale in February of
the group's stake in Trinity International Holdings, and Pounds 4.4m (Pounds
1.8m) in income from associates. The latter rise reflected a strong
performance at Fairfax, the Australian publishing group, which saw
circulation revenues expand 12 per cent and advertising revenues improve by
5 per cent.
The Telegraph had 18.1 per cent of the Fairfax voting stock at the end of
June, and now holds 19.9 per cent with options and convertible notes to take
its stake up to 25 per cent. By the end of the year a further Pounds 28m
will be needed to complete the investment programme, taking the total
investment to Pounds 115m.
Revenue from circulation was up 9.4 per cent at Pounds 56.8m. Circulation of
The Daily Telegraph, which increased its cover price in February from 45p to
48p, fell by 1.8 per cent to 1.02m copies in the first half of the year,
according to the Audit Bureau of Circulations. In the same period average
quality newspaper circulation fell by just over 3 per cent.
The group said that the Saturday edition of The Daily Telegraph had
maintained sales of over 1.2m in the first half, while The Sunday Telegraph
had increased sales by more than 16,000.
Overall advertising revenue was ahead 4.3 per cent at Pounds 67.9m, with a
rise of 10 per cent in display offset by a fall of 3.6 per cent in
classified. Classified recruitment advertising was half the 1989 level.
Advertising made up 54 per cent of the total newspaper revenue and
circulation contributed 46 per cent, compared with 56 and 44 per cent
respectively in the corresponding period.
Mr Black said that the outcome for the next six months would 'depend largely
on any level of upturn in the advertising market'.
In addition to the expansion of the stake in Fairfax, The Telegraph invested
Pounds 67m to take an effective 9.36 per cent increase in Southam, the
Canadian newspaper group.

FT  26 AUG 93 / UK Company News: James Wilkes back in black with Pounds 1m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM DELLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JAMES WILKES, the specialist engineer, returned to profits in the first half
of the year reflecting its cost-cutting programme and a strong performance
by the Floform and Peter Stubs subsidiaries.
On turnover down to Pounds 20.8m (Pounds 28.5m restated for FRS 3 including
Pounds 7.2m for discontinued operations) and after interest charges reduced
from Pounds 1.89m to Pounds 826,000, pre-tax profits amounted to Pounds
1.12m against losses last time of Pounds 5.67m.
Exceptional charges were just Pounds 73,000, compared with an FRS 3 figure
of Pounds 6.74m.
Mr Douglas Rogers, chairman, said the reduction of borrowings remained a key
objective and gearing should be cut from the period end level of 92 per cent
in the second half.
Floform, which manufactures components for the automotive and aerospace
industries, and Peter Stubs, the high speed steel wire and silver steel
maker, performed particularly well in the US, drawing benefit from the
weakness of sterling. Trading at other group businesses, however, remained
patchy.
Earnings per share were 4p against restated losses of 31.2p. To conserve
cash, the interim dividend is cut from 3.25p to 1.5p.

FT  26 AUG 93 / UK Company News: US helps Mayflower to Pounds 2.4m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MAYFLOWER, the specialist UK automotive engineering company, increased
interim pre-tax profits by 50 per cent, helped by higher productivity and a
big jump in US sales.
The pre-tax result for the six months to June 30 rose to Pounds 2.37m
(Pounds 1.58m) on turnover up 48 per cent to Pounds 48.2m (Pounds 32.6m).
The interim dividend is raised to 0.45p (0.40p) on earnings of 1.28p
(1.17p).
Mayflower has grown rapidly in the last three years through the acquisitions
of Motor Panels, the car and commercial vehicle body maker in 1991, and
International Automotive Design, an automotive design and engineering
consultancy.
Excluding IAD, which was bought from the receiver in April for Pounds 3.25m,
Mayflower increased operating profits from continuing operations by 62 per
cent on sales up by 31 per cent.
Sales in the US, where the Motor Panels subsidiary is involved in the
engineering, manufacturing and assembly of truck cabs, jumped 92 per cent
thanks to the recovery in demand for trucks above 16 tonnes gross vehicle
weight.
In the first half Mayflower derived 42.7 per cent of its turnover from the
US and 46.9 per cent from the UK.
It is developing an integrated automotive engineering and manufacturing
operation in the US, following the opening of a product development centre
in Detroit last year and the Dollars 7.5m (Pounds 5.03m) purchase of a
stamping plant in Ohio this year.
IAD lost Pounds 99,000 in the two months from May to June, but Mr John
Simpson, Mayflower chief executive, said the operation was expected to break
even this year after losing about Pounds 2.5m in 1992.
The IAD workforce has fallen to 700 from some 1,100 a year ago and Mayflower
was preparing a restructuring plan for the remaining IAD operations.
The seat-belt webbing division suffered a 9.5 per cent sales fall,
reflecting the decline in continental car production.

FT  26 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Bimec to restructure as part of rescue plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BANKERS to Bimec, which only two years ago was considered one of the purest
of 'green' stock market investments, are to write off Pounds 5m of debt in a
restructuring to keep the receivers at bay.
Announcing the rescue, Mr Roy Barber, chairman, said Bimec would also be
suing its auditors, Grant Thornton, for breach of contract and negligence.
The perilous state of the company was apparent but undisclosed in the audit
for the year ending March 1992, Bimec claims.
The water, waste treatment and engineering company reported pre-tax losses
of Pounds 16.4m (Pounds 6.04m profits) in the year to end-March, on sales
down 22 per cent at Pounds 80.8m.
This loss was almost double the sum of profits in the five previous years
and leaves Bimec with negative shareholders' funds.
Losses per share amounted to 13.9p (5.1p earnings) and there is no dividend.
In 1992 the group announced and then cancelled its final dividend, causing
the shares to lose two thirds of their value.
Mr Barber, who was appointed last September, and Bimec's advisers,
Schroders, said that without the restructuring, Lloyds, the company's
bankers, would be invited to appoint receivers.
As part of the restructuring, Bimec will sell a number of businesses,
including assets in its aero and industrial division and two businesses in
its water and waste treatment divisions to EIS, the engineering group.
The total proceeds from the sale are expected to be Pounds 8m. EIS is paying
Pounds 5m.
In addition to writing off Pounds 5m of debt, Lloyds is converting Pounds
500,000 it is owed into ordinary shares and Pounds 3m into preference
shares.
The bank has also agreed to provide a five-year Pounds 4.9m interest free
loan.
Lloyds support is dependent on shareholders' approval and Bimec continuing
its proposed disposal programme.
Mr Barber said that after the restructuring the group would be focused in
waste and water treatment with sales of about Pounds 30m. At its peak in
1991 Bimec had sales of more than Pounds 100m.
Following the restructuring the company would have repaid, written off or
converted all its Pounds 16m of net debt and would have the ability to draw
down on the Lloyds bank facility, he said.
The issue of shares to Lloyds Bank will dilute existing ordinary holdings by
8 per cent.
The businesses being sold to EIS had combined losses of Pounds 3.2m on sales
of Pounds 24m, after exceptional costs of Pounds 2.7m in the last financial
year.
Two of the businesses are suppliers of equipment to the process plant, water
treat-ment and environmental industries.
The others develop and supply parts and undertake overhauls and repairs for
aircraft and jet engines.

FT  26 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Gloomy outlook at Hickson after 17% midway
decline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HICKSON International, the speciality chemicals and timber treatment
company, yesterday disappointed with a 17 per cent fall in profits and a
downbeat assessment of second half prospects.
The company also announced a reduction in its capital expenditure programme
to prevent gearing from rising further to levels it would consider
unacceptable.
The pre-tax profits fall from Pounds 14.4m to Pounds 12m for the six months
to June 30 was partly due to a Pounds 2.4m increase in the interest bill as
deposit earnings fell but the group continued to pay fixed rate debt.
The fine chemicals division, the group's least mature business area,
suffered a 39 per cent fall in operating profit to Pounds 3.9m. The division
suffered demand and margin pressure in the continental European
agrochemicals and detergent brightener markets.
The result also reflected operating difficulties that were larger than
expected following September's explosion at Castleford and included
provision for a Pounds 250,000 fine related to the accident in which five
people died.
'Our management team were too confident and too optimistic about how quickly
we could get growth back into this division,' said Mr Dennis Kerrison, chief
executive.
Group turnover amounted to Pounds 198.5m (Pounds 173.7m). The interim
dividend is maintained at 2.85p, payable from earnings of 4.8p (6.2p).
COMMENT
Since the August 7 explosion at its Irish plant - the group's second within
a year - the shares have shed over 15 per cent of their value in a rising
market. Judging by the downbeat statement about second half prospects and
the serious deterioration in the fine chemicals division, it is hard to see
why the slide should not continue. Even given an element of yield support
the shares remain on a demanding prospective multiple of 20 for this year on
profits forecast now at about Pounds 21m, almost a third down on predictions
12 months ago. Hickson's problems stem from the lack of predictability in
its earnings. It would not take many more fines for environmental
misdemeanors or extra capital costs to update plant to meet more exacting
regulatory standards before the balance sheet started to look stretched or
the latest profits forecasts looked suspect.

FT  26 AUG 93 / UK Company News: New Pounds 135m reinsurance group
underlines interest in sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BARCLAYS DE Zoete Wedd is organising finances for a new Sydney-based
reinsurance company in a move reflecting growing investor interest in the
market for catastrophe reinsurance.
Reinsurance Australia Corporation is expected to have capital of ADollars
300m (Pounds 135m) and will be headed by Mr Michael Kelly, a senior London
underwriter currently with Kemper Re (UK).
Five leading Australian pension funds and life insurance companies are
investing in REAC, which may be floated on the Australian stock exchange
within the next 12 months. A further ADollars 200m could be raised to
support the new venture's growth.
The company will underwrite a worldwide account of property excess of loss
business and will aim to be a market leader.
Mr Kelly said the 'time was right' to launch the new company, which has been
under consideration for two years. He believes further rises in rates are
likely when insurers renew annual reinsurance programmes later this year and
said that the new influx of capacity will not lead to any resumption of rate
competition.
It is the latest in a wave of new ventures formed this year following
sizeable rate rises since 1990, a shrinkage of capacity in traditional
markets, especially in London, and a strong revival in the sector's
profitability.
Investors, mainly from the US, are ploughing more than Dollars 1bn (Pounds
600m) into Bermuda, the centre of most recent activity, where at least five
new ventures have been formed in recent weeks.
Two new companies have also been formed in London, following initiatives by
NAC Re and Liberty Mutual.
It has also emerged this week that another specialist London-based reinsurer
is to be set up by the Benfield Group, an independent insurance broker.
It is understood that the new venture is aiming to have paid-up capital of
Pounds 50m, writing about Pounds 100m premium income in its first year.
The prospect of rising rates is also leading a number of UK and US banks and
securities houses to examine investment in the Lloyd's of London insurance
market which is currently opening its doors to corporate capital.

FT  26 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Caution at Aegis despite recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AEGIS, the holding company of Europe's largest media-buying and planning
group, returned to the black with pre-tax profits of Pounds 13.2m for the
first six months of 1993.
That compared with break-even last time and a Pounds 1.9m loss for the year
to December 31 1992.
Turnover rose 4 per cent to Pounds 1.45bn (Pounds 1.39bn), with the first
three months being particularly strong, analysts said.
No interim dividend will be paid and the company reaffirmed that no final
dividend will be proposed.
Earnings per share were 2.16p (losses of 13.1p). Profits after tax were
Pounds 9.2m (Pounds 8.8m loss). Net average debt in the past six months was
Pounds 66m.
Mr Frank Law, chairman, said yesterday that while the first half results
were 'satisfactory', the overall picture in Europe was still clouded by 'a
general weakness in European advertising markets' implying 'continued
pressure on group profits in the second half of the year.' Mr Law also said
that the group had managed to reduce operating costs by 3 per cent.
Analysts said that the impact of recent legislative changes in France make
it difficult to accurately forecast final results for the group, but some
were reducing pre-tax profit forecasts from about Pounds 28m to Pounds 25m
or less.
'Aegis have diligently been trying to dig themselves out of a hole. They are
still the market leader and are now back in profit. But they are not yet out
of the wood,' said one analyst.

FT  26 AUG 93 / UK Company News: BSkyB behind advance at News Intl
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A MOVE into profits at BSkyB, the satellite television venture, and a Pounds
45m swing on interest helped to boost pre-tax profits at Mr Rupert Murdoch's
News International from Pounds 48.1m to Pounds 161.2m for the year ended in
June.
Turnover edged ahead by 2 per cent to Pounds 708m, from Pounds 696.2m
previously. However, operating profits for the group - which publishes The
Sun, The Times, The Sunday Times and other UK newspapers - rose to Pounds
140.9m from a previous Pounds 124.9m, a rise of 13 per cent, reflecting an
increase in margins.
The group, a subsidiary of the Australian News Corporation, said that
revenues from circulation and advertising remained relatively flat
throughout the year. But it had continued to benefit from reduced overhead
costs and increased efficiency through plant modernisation.
News International said that the benefit of declining interest rates and the
effect of new financing arrangements had led to net income from interest of
Pounds 1.6m compared with a net interest charge of Pounds 43.4m for the
previous year.
BSkyB, in which News International has a 50 per cent stake, contributed
Pounds 26.7m following a loss of Pounds 13.3m previously. Total losses from
associates in 1991-92 were Pounds 17.3m. Pearson, owner of the Financial
Times, also holds a significant stake in the satellite television company
following the merger of Sky Television and British Satellite Broadcasting in
November 1990.
Analysts estimate that the total trading profit for BSkyB for the full year
was Pounds 60m before interest on its guaranteed loan facility estimated at
between Pounds 6m and Pounds 7m. They expect the business, now reaping the
benefits of the merger, to increase trading profits to about Pounds 150m in
the coming year. However, shareholders in BSkyB have yet to earn a return on
their investment.
Profits also benefited from a reduction in losses on sales of fixed assets
from Pounds 16m to Pounds 7.9m.
Earnings per share were 15.27p, up from 3.95p. The pay-out on special
dividend shares is 1.369p, made up of an interim 0.701p and a final of
0.668p. This compares with 0.997p for 1991-92, comprising 0.524p and 0.453p.

FT  26 AUG 93 / IBM taps into strength to play the power game: Big Blue is
turning tables on its partner Intel by developing a clone microchip
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
International Business Machines is turning the tables. Long the victim of
'cloners' of its mainframe computers, disk drives and personal computers,
IBM is now turning predator - developing its own 'clone' of Intel's
top-selling microprocessors; the 'brains' of personal computers.
IBM is understood to be developing its own version of the Intel 'microcode'
or internal software instructions that control the functions of a
microprocessor. This would enable IBM to produce microprocessors that do not
rely upon Intel technology.
IBM is responding to a radical shift of power from computer manufacturers to
semiconductor makers over the last decade. If it successfully reverses that
through its new venture, IBM could regain some of its technological
leadership.
But the price could be high. IBM could damage its partnership with Intel
which has created the global PC industry with sales of Dollars 70bn (Pounds
46.9bn) a year.
For more than a decade, Intel has supplied microprocessors to manufacturers
of 'IBM-compatible' personal computers. Now IBM is planning to produce and
sell 'Intel-compatible' chips - devices that can run all of the thousands of
software programs designed for Intel-based PCs.
Some 10 years ago, Intel was on its uppers; struggling to keep pace with
Japanese competitors and losing money in the process. IBM came to the
rescue, like a beneficent giant, investing Dollars 400m in Intel to ensure
that its chip supplier would survive.
Today, Intel is the world's largest and most profitable semiconductor
company and it is IBM that is in the red and painfully cutting its
operations and workforce.
Cloning Intel's microcode is a key step in IBM's plan to seize control of
the core technology of its Dollars 10bn personal computer business,
correcting what many industry analysts see as a serious mistake in the early
days of the PC market that made IBM beholden to outside suppliers, in
particular Intel and Microsoft, the software company.
IBM appears determined to exert more control over both aspects of PC
development. On the software side, it has already begun to draw away from
Microsoft by, for example, offering its own version of DOS, the standard PC
operating software. It is also developing a new generation of operating
system, called Workplace which will have broader compatibility with other
software.
On the hardware side, IBM's 'cloning' effort is believed to be geared
primarily towards ensuring that a new generation of microprocessors, called
PowerPC, jointly developed by IBM with Motorola and Apple computer, can take
advantage of the huge established base of PC software applications.
With the addition of Intel-compatible microcode, PowerPC may be able to
emulate an Intel microprocessor so fast that users would not know nor care
what type of chip was inside their computers.
This would greatly enhance the market prospects for PowerPC computers,
including those planned by IBM and Apple, and also make PowerPC chips more
competitive with Intel's microprocessors.
The cloning effort could thus boost IBM's nascent efforts to become a big
player in the semiconductor chip market.
Until recently, IBM's huge chip plants in the US, Europe and Japan have
produced devices only of use in IBM 's own computers. Now the company is
actively seeking opportunities to sell chips to the outside world.
Mr Louis Gerstner, IBM chairman and chief executive, recently identified
semiconductor sales as strategic to the company's return to profit.
The high-performance microprocessor market is one of the fastest growing and
most lucrative segments of the semiconductor market.
Intel is the runaway leader in the microprocessor field, with an estimated
one-third share of the world market, according to Integrated Circuit
Engineering, a US market research group. In the 32-bit high-performance
sector Intel dominates with a 72 per cent share. In 1992, Intel's unit
shipments of 32-bit microprocessors totalled about 20m, according to ICE
estimates, while other competitors combined sold about 9m of this type of
chips.
It is expected to take IBM at least another year to complete development of
its Intel 'clone' microcode. Starting from scratch, IBM's software
developers must ensure that their work is not 'tainted' by the inclusion of
any of Intel's technology that could could run them into legal problems.
Yet IBM's unique relationship with Intel might encourage both companies to
reach an accommodation. Already, Intel has licensed IBM to produce
Intel-designed microprocessors for use in its own products. IBM is also
offering circuit-boards incorporating its home-built Intel-designed chips to
other PC makers.
IBM has also demonstrated its ability to improve upon Intel's microprocessor
designs. Earlier this month, it announced 'Blue Lightning' a speeded-up
version of Intel's 486 microprocessor. Similarly, IBM has developed faster,
and lower power versions of Intel's 386.
After 10 years as allies, Intel and IBM appear to be heading towards direct
competition, threatening a partnership that has dominated the PC market. The
consequences of the changing relationship between the world's largest
computer and semiconductor manufacturers are likely to touch every
participant in the market.

FT  26 AUG 93 / WH Smith cuts costs to move ahead by 5%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WH SMITH, the retail and distribution group, yesterday gave an upbeat
trading statement and announced an unexpected improvement in pre-tax
profits, in spite of increasing losses at Do It All, its DIY joint venture
with Boots.
Pre-tax profits for the year to May 29 were Pounds 113.8m, up 5.3 per cent
on last year's Pounds 108.1m, restated according to FRS3. That was well
ahead of analysts' forecasts of about Pounds 110m.
The shares closed up 16p at 471p.
Sir Simon Hornby, chairman, said all the group's retail businesses had
recovered strongly in the second half.
'This was caused partly by a modest revival in consumer spending, but more
particularly by the actions we have taken to cut costs and increase sales.'
Sir Simon added the underlying increase in sales had continued since the
year-end.
Smith has reduced staff by 800, and increased profit per employee by 3.2 per
cent.
Group turnover, excluding Do It All, and Virgin Retail, the joint venture
with the Virgin group, rose 8.7 per cent to Pounds 2.31bn.
Overall sales in the retail businesses increased 13.4 per cent to Pounds
1.48bn, with like-for-like sales - excluding newly-opened stores - up 8.8
per cent.
UK retail sales, including WH Smith, Waterstones bookshops, and Our Price
record shops, were 5.3 per cent ahead at Pounds 1.23bn, with sales of books,
music, and videos all stronger in the second half.
In the US, where Smith continues to expand with a chain of bookstalls in
airports and hotels, a record shop chain, and two Waterstones, sales
increased 55.5 per cent to Pounds 200.6m, and operating profits 69.2 per
cent to Pounds 11m.
Group operating profits increased to Pounds 130.3m (from Pounds 120.9), but
losses at associated undertakings - Do It All and Virgin - rose to Pounds
14.4m from a restated Pounds 9.4m. Smiths' share of the operating loss at Do
It All increased to Pounds 14.3m, with sales down 7.3 per cent.
Smiths made a one-off gain of Pounds 4.6m on the sale of its stake in
Yorkshire Television.
The final dividend was raised to 9.9p, for a total payout of 14.2p (from
13.4p). Earnings fell slightly to 31.1p (from 31.2p).

FT  26 AUG 93 / RTZ sells Pillar to MB-Caradon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY and KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MB-CARADON, the building products and security printing group yesterday
agreed to buy most of the Pillar industrial businesses of RTZ, the mining
company, for around Pounds 800m. MB-Caradon also announced a Pounds 334m
rights issue to help fund the cash purchase.
The deal will double MB-Caradon's building products turnover, and compares
with the group's market value of Pounds 1.43bn yesterday morning.
MB-Caradon's shareholders are to vote on the deal, and on a name change to
Caradon, reflecting the increased scale of the building products activities.
RTZ expects to realise about Pounds 900m from the sale of the whole of
Pillar, and plans to sell the remaining loss-making activities 'as soon as
practicable'. It faces an exceptional loss of Pounds 165m, but the sale will
cut its gearing from 40 to 14 per cent.
MB-Caradon said after the deal its gearing would be around 24 per cent but
this would rise once 'fair-value adjustments' had been made to the assets.
The share prices of both companies responded positively to the deal, which
was trailed last week. MB-Caradon's shares rose 24p to 336p, compared with
the one-for-four rights issue price of 260p, and RTZ's were 9 1/2 p higher
at 712p.
The businesses being bought cover most of Pillar's building products and
electrical and engineering operations, including brands such as MK Electric,
Friedland door bells, Peachtree and Better-Bilt doors and windows.
Mr Peter Jansen, chief executive of MB-Caradon, said 84 per cent by turnover
of the Pillar businesses being bought fitted with existing MB-Caradon
activities in building products and automotive components.
The businesses being acquired made an operating profit of Pounds 75.4m in
1992. The purchase price compares with net assets at the end of 1992 of
Pounds 426m, rising to Pounds 462.8m at the end of June.
MB-Caradon also reported interim results showing pre-tax profits slightly
down at Pounds 59.5m before the exceptional profit on its CarnaudMetalbox
stake sold in April. The businesses being bought made interim operating
profits of Pounds 39.7m, up 20 per cent, on sales of Pounds 538m, up 12 per
cent.

FT  26 AUG 93 / News Corp raises payout on 84.5% increase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
NEWS Corporation, Mr Rupert Murdoch's international media group, reported
yesterday a surge in profits with almost all its divisions, notably
newspapers worldwide and US television, contributing to the revival of the
company.
In the UK, BSkyB made its first profit and newspapers such as the Sun and
The Sunday Times benefited from cost cutting while advertising and
circulation revenues remained flat.
Group net profits for the year ended June soared 84.5 per cent to ADollars
978.9m (Pounds 439m) from ADollars 530.5m a year earlier as revenue rose 4.9
per cent to ADollars 10.69bn. The annual dividend is going up from 2.5 cents
to 3 cents a share.
The two biggest components of the improvement were: a turnround from a
ADollars 56.8m loss to a ADollars 177.3m profit from associate companies,
including BSkyB satellite television operation in the UK and the Ansett
airline business in Australia; and a reduction from ADollars 931.7m to
ADollars 737.1m in net interest expense following the equity issues and debt
restructuring which have returned the group to financial health.
The company excluded an ADollars 114.6m abnormal loss from the result
(ADollars 29m loss previously), mainly reflecting unrealised exchange losses
in the Ansett group.
News Corp's operating income in the UK rose from ADollars 381.8m to ADollars
401.9m, as operating profits from UK newspapers increased 9 per cent. The
company said advertising and circulation revenue had remained flat and the
result came mainly from operating efficiencies and plant modernisation.
'Operating profits at the Sun, News of the World, and The Sunday Times all
showed significant gains,' said directors.
The company said its 50 per cent stake in BSkyB contributed Pounds 26.7m to
profits, compared with a Pounds 13.3m loss. Revenues grew more than 60 per
cent as the number of subscribers to films and sport grew.
Operating revenue from the US rose from ADollars 880m to ADollars 964.3m as
Fox Broadcasting and Fox Television turned in record profits. Directors said
profits rose 6 per cent in the magazine and inserts business while
HarperCollins books made flat profits.
Operating earnings from Australia and the Pacific Basin rose from ADollars
328.9m to ADollars 336.1m.

FT  26 AUG 93 / GPA near to signing GE rescue agreement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ADVISERS to GPA Group are confident that the aircraft leasing company will
sign its rescue deal with GE Capital, the financial services arm of General
Electric of the US, within the next few days. The agreement will separate
GPA's Dollars 5.2bn (Pounds 3.48bn) borrowings from its assets.
A new company, to be called GE Capital Aviation Management, will be
responsible for the leasing business of GPA and GE's subsidiary Polaris
Aircraft leasing. Its executive chairman is expected to be Mr Tony Ryan,
GPA's chairman and founder, who will work with a chief executive appointed
from GE.
Mr Patrick Blaney, who was recently promoted to GPA's board after attempting
to remove Mr Ryan as chairman, is likely to take charge of the old GPA.
The two companies will be based at GPA's Shannon headquarters in the
Republic of Ireland, although Polaris will continue to have an office in San
Francisco.
GE is now confident it has a watertight agreement to manage GPA's fleet  -
it has already agreed in principle to buy Dollars 1.35bn of GPA's aircraft -
without being liable for the debt.
The deal should have been signed last month. It was delayed by fears that GE
could be held responsible for GPA's liabilities.
Under the terms of the agreement GPA has effectively delegated the
day-to-day management of its 470 aircraft to GE Capital Aviation Management.
A limited number of specified claims by GPA's core shareholders underwriting
the deal and by the group's banks are being waived. GPA is confident this
will enable it to meet interest and principal debt repayments to both its
secured and unsecured creditors from leasing revenues generated by the new
subsidiary of GE. But if it cannot do so, creditors will have no recourse to
GE.
Mr Ryan is to be joined at the new GE subsidiary by Mr Jim King, GPA's vice
chairman, Mr Colm Barrington, GPA's commercial director and Mr Phil Bolger,
who has been largely responsible for running the leasing business. Mr John
Tierney will remain finance director of the old GPA. Mr Maurice Foley, GPA's
deputy chairman, is also expected to stay on at GPA until March when he will
become a non-executive director.

FT  26 AUG 93 / Perot book plays on job loss fears in anti-Nafta campaign
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR ROSS PEROT, the populist US billionaire, is to step up his vigorous
national campaign against the North American Free Trade Agreement,
threatening its passage through a sceptical Congress.
Mr Perot is launching a book - Save Your Job, Save Our Country: Why Nafta
Must be Stopped - Now] - on September 6, Labour Day. He intends to promote
the book and play on fears of unemployment flowing from Nafta with a series
of speeches and television appearances during the next weeks.
The political elite may scoff at Mr Perot, but the 150-page book, at an
affordable Dollars 6.95, is a well-organised, easy-to-read polemic against
the agreement, between the US, Canada and Mexico. The administration has
given no sign that it can reply.
Legislation to implement Nafta and its recently-completed side-agreements on
labour and environment will be sent in September to Congress, where it is
already in deep trouble. Both houses have 90 legislative days to hold a
yes-or-no vote.
Mr Perot, speaking in simple terms which elude trade negotiators, says that
the US has been 'out-traded again'. By the deal, Mexico's rickety, unsafe
trucks will be able to move into the US before American trucks can carry
goods in Mexico, he says.
Mexican investors will be able to own US farms, forests and real estate,
while US investors will be restricted to owning only 49 per cent of any
enterprise that owns agricultural or forest land in Mexico. The same applies
to investment in construction.
Mr Perot highlights the 'low wages and tame unions' which attract US
executives to move production over the border. Mexico keeps wages low and
health and safety enforcement lax, Mr Perot says. That produces 'a giant
sucking sound', the sound of jobs going south of the border. US negotiators
'gave away' jobs by allowing Mexico to keep most of its motor industry
investment and production restrictions for another 10 years.
Mexico gets 'unrestricted access' to US and Canadian feed grains (which both
countries are competing to sell) to develop massive beef operations which
will undercut the US and Canadian industries, he claims.
This and more was agreed by negotiators whose motives Mr Perot suspects.
'Mexico's chief legal adviser . . . was a former under-secretary of trade at
the US Commerce Department,' he says. 'The US team on the other hand was
composed of bureaucrats.'

FT  26 AUG 93 / France eases stance on ERM: Balladur and Kohl seek common
ground on economic union
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING, QUENTIN PEEL and DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS, BONN, BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE FRENCH government signalled a more relaxed attitude towards the European
exchange rate mechanism yesterday by indicating that France was in no hurry
to return to the narrow bands which led to last month's currency crisis.
Mr Edouard Balladur, the French prime minister, made his conciliatory
remarks on the eve of today's Franco-German summit in Bonn.
The meeting between the leaders of France and Germany is aimed at finding
common ground on European economic and monetary union and resolving
differences on trade and other bilateral issues.
Pressure on Mr Balladur and Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany to reach
agreement increased when Mr Karel Van Miert, vice-president of the European
Commission, warned that achievements such as the single European market
could come apart if the momentum towards economic and monetary union (Emu)
was not regained.
'The Community is living dangerously,' the Belgian commissioner said
yesterday, 'and we could say that the EC itself is floating' (with its
currencies).
A successful meeting today between Mr Balladur and Chancellor Kohl is vital
if the European Community is to emerge from its current crisis in reasonable
shape.
Mr Balladur said yesterday that France was determined to proceed with Emu.
He added that France should avoid letting the franc reach its new wider
limit, agreed as part of the ERM reforms this month.
Mr Balladur said France was determined that the second phase of European
economic and monetary union should come into effect on schedule next year
and that he will discuss how to achieve economic convergence with Mr Kohl.
His statement on ERM fluctuation bands was interpreted by economists as a
more pragmatic response to the European currency crisis which broke the
franc's close link with the D-Mark and widened bands from 2.25 per cent to
15 per cent.
The expectation in Bonn is that the two heads of government will seek to
give a clear statement of their determination to co-operate, without very
precise ideas on how to resolve their outstanding problems - including the
future of the EMS and Gatt.
Proposals on how to maintain the momentum towards Emu, in spite of the
recent currency upheaval, are still being discussed at the level of senior
officials. 'The heads of government would be well advised to leave it
there,' one official said.
Although there is a desire to promise closer co-operation on economic and
budgetary policies, both sides are constrained by their domestic political
realities. Mr Kohl is locked into a strict budget savings plan which does
not allow for an early relaxation.
But Mr Karl Lamers, foreign policy spokesman of Mr Kohl's Christian
Democratic Union, called on both sides to co-ordinate their economic
policies: 'If we cannot succeed in bringing Germany and France back into
monetary harmony, then the European Monetary System will no longer be the
preliminary step towards a currency union.'

THE US yesterday imposed economic sanctions on China and Pakistan, claiming
they dealt in sensitive missile technology in violation of international
arms controls.
Mr Mike McCurry, the State Department spokesman, said the US would prohibit
sales of sensitive technology - that with both military and civilian uses,
as well as munitions - to both countries for two years.
The decision is expected to cost US companies Dollars 400m (Pounds 268m) to
Dollars 500m in lost sales.
The sanctions are expected to have little impact on Pakistan, which is not a
big consumer of such US products.
Asked if American companies would be protected against their losses, Mr
McCurry said: 'No. That's a significant cost that we pay but it reflects the
seriousness with which we look at the issue of nuclear prolifera-tion.'
Yesterday's announcement followed months of disagreement among US
intelligence agencies about whether China was shipping components of the
M-11 missile to Pakistan in violation of the International Missile
Technology Control Regime.
This week the agencies said they had reached a consensus that the sales had
taken place.
M-11 missiles can be equipped with nuclear warheads and have a range of
nearly 300 miles.
Under US law, the administration is required to impose sanctions for
breaches of the missile control regime, severity depending on the gravity of
the violation.
Retaliation might have been waived if considered in the national interest.
President Bill Clinton has vowed to take a strong line regarding China and
weapons proliferation.
By choosing not to retaliate against Chinese exports to the US, he has
probably contained the dispute, which might have grown to include a Chinese
embargo against US agriculture and other low technology products.
China has consistently denied making illicit sales. Pakistan yesterday also
denied that its purchases had broken US rules.
The foreign ministry said Pakistan had acquired only 'some short-range
missiles' from China after being attacked by Soviet-made scud missiles from
Afghanistan in the late 1980s.
'Concern for missile proliferation does not arise from Pakistan but from
India's extensive missile development programme, including the Prithvi and
Agni missile systems,' an official said.
He said Pakistan would respond positively to a US proposal for talks with
India to prevent a missile race.
State Department officials this week made a final, apparently unheeded,
attempt to persuade China to abide by the missile technology regime.

FT  26 AUG 93 / The Lex Column: WH Smith
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
WH Smith's careful excision of Do It All from the breakdown of its figures
almost implies that it does not own the business. Perhaps Smith wishes it
didn't. The red ink at Do It All flowed as freely as expected, yet Smith's
timid roll out of its new trading format and coyness over its impact hardly
add to confidence. Nor is it a persuasive excuse that some stores are badly
located. If the company cannot find another 50 of its 220 sites which would
benefit from treatment, the portfolio is a rag bag indeed.
In truth, Smith's strategy for Do It All is a mixture of shutting the very
worst stores, spending the minimum on the few certain to benefit and
whistling to keep its spirits up. How long partner Boots will be prepared to
indulge this is an interesting question. Smith is trying to muddle through,
while hoping for a strong housing upturn, because the alternatives of
closing Do It All or heavy investment are simply too costly. Boots has the
cash flow and balance sheet to take the strain. Smith, by contrast, would
have seen a rise in borrowings this year had not freakishly strong sales in
the last month distorted the figures.
It is not as though prospects are particularly rosy elsewhere. Getting
Waterstone's to an acceptable return on capital will be a protracted
process, Virgin Megastores are proving that Our Price sites are simply too
small, and the company's improbably low tax charge cannot last forever.
Since the core businesses will also struggle to sparkle, the company must
long for the days when it had surplus profits to squander on its adventures.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The plan to beam Bart Simpson into Bangkok via satellite has, if nothing
else, restored News Corporation's forward momentum. Before the acquisition
of a controlling interest in Star TV last month, its shares were becalmed.
They have since risen by 20 per cent, adding another leg to the bull run
stretching back to 1991. Since Star is unlikely to contribute much by way of
earnings in the near-term, that appreciation might seem curious. After two
years restoring order to News Corp's balance sheet, though, the deal has
been taken as a signal that Mr Rupert Murdoch is feeling expansive.
There is no shortage of recovery potential within the existing empire.
Having driven margins higher in the depths of recession, UK newspapers
should be well geared to any cyclical upturn in advertising. The network of
US television stations continues to grow, while Fox films must surely come
up with a blockbuster movie before too long. Even the investments in BSkyB
and Ansett are starting to look less of a drag on earnings. But there is
scarcely a stock market where cyclical profits recovery is not now taken for
granted. Investors are now looking to News Corp for more.
So long as equity and bond markets are receptive, Mr Murdoch will not have
to rely on the banks to fulfil his ambitions. Although interest cover is
comfortable and no large debt repayments fall due until the second half of
the decade, that will doubtless be a relief. The Star acquisition was paid
for with equity and cash raised from an issue of convertible stock. Having
driven the shares higher in anticipation of the next move, the market should
expect more of the same.

FT  26 AUG 93 / The Lex Column: Caradon crows
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
After the warm reception accorded by the market to MB-Caradon's purchase of
RTZ's industrial businesses, it seems churlish to ask whether the company
has bitten off more than it can chew. The deal takes it a whole stage
further down the road towards becoming a specialised building materials
group. Though it is paying a full price, it has managed to avoid being
saddled with the least attractive parts of RTZ's Pillar division. Yet Pounds
800m is a lot of money for Caradon to spend when its own market
capitalisation is only Pounds 1.5bn. To absorb the goodwill it must seek
court permission, for the second time in as many years, to cancel the
balance on its share premium account. Without yesterday's rights issue it
would hardly have had a balance left to cancel.
This is not to say that Caradon is condemned to flounder. It has a good
record in managing the recession and has sensibly eschewed the temptation to
opt for a hostile bid for a company like Pilkington. That would have
involved paying a premium for a company heavily dependent on one product and
on a weak European market. The stock market is clearly relieved that Caradon
has chosen a negotiated acquisition of a collection of businesses poised to
enjoy the US and UK upturn. But it may also be underestimating the extent of
the challenge that lies ahead.
It is easy to claim that the acquisition will enhance Caradon's earnings
next year. This year's earnings will be diluted by putting the proceeds of
the sale of its CarnaudMetalbox stake on deposits at low interest rates. So
almost any acquisition would have enhanced future earnings. The real test is
how skilfully Caradon manages to integrate the large family of Pillar
companies and push up their margins. That may be easier said than done,
especially in the North American building sector.
Gearing, too, may turn out less comfortable than suggested by the pro forma
24 per cent in yesterday's statement. Even a modest fair value provision and
cash outlay on reorganisation would push the figure closer to 50 per cent.
That might prompt disposals, though Caradon would hardly rush to part with
its lucrative security printing division. Some of the other businesses
acquired as part of the package, such as automotive or aero-engineering,
might go. Caradon would then be judged even more as a pure building
materials company. Its historic multiple of 22 makes it look cheap against
Redland and RMC whose ratings are both over 30. Its more limited recovery
prospects mean, though, that at 336p the shares are hardly cheap.
RTZ is left with a Pounds 165m exceptional loss and the task of disposing of
the rump of its Pillar division. But it has also the satisfaction of seeing
gearing fall to 14 per cent. That will allow it to prospect for new
investments in mining. Its hand would be even freer if the government goes
ahead with the introduction of foreign income dividends. RTZ would then no
longer need to worry about maintaining enough UK income to prevent a
build-up of unrelieved ACT.

A word of warning to Simon Stevens, who has just departed Invesco for the
calmer waters of Carnegie International, London arm of the Swedish brokerage
operation: decline any invitations from group chief executive Lars Bertmar
for breakfast at the Ritz.
Back in November 1991, Carnegie International's senior management troika had
been looking forward to talking business, if not money, with their new big
boss over the scrambled eggs.
Imagine their surprise when, instead of Bertmar, in walked his lawyer to
serve them with dismissal notices. Bertmar, who said the idea was to
indicate that he was 'hands on', has been in charge of London ever since.
Obviously, he now feels that in Stevens he has found an executive who will
allow him to take his 'hands off' London, for the moment at least.

Watch out David Lloyd, the fading tennis star who has built a Pounds 100m
leisure centre business: the Beckwith boys are back in business.
Old Harrovians Peter and John Beckwith, who made an estimated Pounds 80m by
selling their property empire to the Swedes at the top of the market, have
decided to reinvest some of their fortune in leisure.
They have bought back the upmarket Riverside Racquet Centre (annual fee over
Pounds 1,000 and a waiting list of six months) plus a couple of health clubs
in the City from the Swedish owners to whom they sold them. They plan to
develop a large leisure group to take advantage of the upturn in the
economy.
No word on the price, but the business is thought to be making Pounds 1.2m a
year and seems amazingly recession-proof. Indeed, chief executive David
Haslam, who does the talking for the Beckwiths, says one of his members had
his house repossessed but refused to give up his Riverside membership.
Just the sort of tale one
might expect from a property
developer.

Does Naim Attallah, publisher and Asprey's boss, have a better eye for
clothes than Martin Taylor, Courtaulds Textiles' outgoing chief executive?
When Courtaulds pulled the plug on thirty-something society couturier
Arabella Pollen's business in May - after backing it for three years -
Taylor's image took a rare knock and the British design world was plunged
into deep gloom.
Now it is the turn of one of the very few other youngish British designers,
32-year-old Tomasz Starzewski, who has weathered the recession to see
Attallah's luxury goods group buy up a controlling share.
Actually, the well-connected Pollen, whose father was the former head of
Sotheby's in the US, also came to the attention of the ever chivalrous
publisher when she started over a decade ago.
But they parted company and his eye has turned to Starzewski, a first
generation Polish immigrant who took his first step on the ladder from above
a Fulham fish and chip shop in which he sewed and slept. But then a
hard-nosed businessman like Attallah is no snob.

Now that lust has faded from the headlines, fear of unemployment seems to be
the number one concern troubling Ireland's priests.
There are just too many of them. 'Let's face it,' writes Father Brendan
Hoban of County Mayo in a magazine for priests, 'many priests wake up in the
morning wondering how they are going to pass the day.'
Clergy line up to say a few words at wedding receptions and death notices
are desperately scanned to find a funeral to attend. 'Everywhere we go now,
we are tripping over each other,' continues Hoban.
'Most of us seem to spend our time answering invitations to social
functions, breeding horses, training juveniles, celebrating jubilees, and
pricing cars.
It's becoming almost impossible to get a game of golf on the clergy
circuit.'

<TEXT>
What will Nigerian military ruler General Babangida do when he relinquishes
power?
There have been reports in the French press that he has already bought a
property on France's Cote d'Azur for around FFr10m. It's a villa near Grasse
standing in three hectares of land and was built in a Moorish style in the
1850s. Queen Victoria once stayed there.
However, old Africa hands play down the significance of any such purchase in
terms of what it says about Babangida's future plans. For a start, it is
standard practice for heads of state both in and out of work to buy
properties in stable countries like France, and several have second homes on
the Cote d'Azur.
It doesn't necessarily mean he has given up all political ambition. One need
look no further than Zaire's president Mobutu, who has several properties in
France and Switzerland and has turned out to be one of Africa's great
survivors.

FT  26 AUG 93 / Leading Article: Nasa lost in space
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NASA scientists listening with increasing desperation for radio signals
from their Mars Observer spacecraft realise that much more is at stake than
the Dollars 1bn mission to study the red planet. Failure to make contact
with the silent probe would be a crushing blow to future missions to Mars,
which had been designed to use Observer for communications and/or for
spotting promising places to land on the planet's surface. More generally,
an Observer write-off, following a string of other technical and managerial
disasters, would raise the most fundamental questions about the US space
agency and the management of its Dollars 14bn-a-year budget.
Nasa's morale has never fully recovered from the 1986 Challenger disaster.
The manned shuttle programme is still plagued with technical problems.
Several scientific missions, including the Hubble space telescope, are
performing below par. And poor leadership has left Nasa's plans to build an
orbiting space station in disarray; Congress may yet kill the project.
One part of the agency is still running well, its public relations. But even
a PR machine that makes the most of every opportunity - for example,
trumpeting fuzzy pictures from the space telescope as breakthroughs in our
understanding of the universe - cannot disguise the fact that Nasa needs
radical reform.
The problem is that the gung-ho Nasa of the 1960s, geared up to beat the
Soviets to the moon and then the planets, has grown into an elaborate
bureaucracy. Its senior managers, including several astronauts from the
glory days, tend to be more interested in running multi-billion dollar
mega-projects than cost-effective scientific missions. The emphasis is on
technology rather than science.
Radical solutions
Given the reality of Washington politics, the most radical solutions are not
feasible. It might make sense, for example, to remove the space science
activities, such as observatories and planetary exploration, from Nasa and
fold them into the National Science Foundation. Nasa would then be
responsible for manned activities - the shuttle and science station - and
for promoting space technology. But the agency has too many defenders, in
congress and the aerospace industry, who would fight to prevent anything
that looked like a break-up.
So the overhaul has to take place within Nasa's current boundaries. The
first requirement is to make sure that space exploration is really led by
science rather than the internal agenda of Nasa managers. That means giving
scientists outside the agency, particularly from universities, more say in
its programmes. The practical result is likely to be a larger number of
smaller, more flexible - and more imaginative - missions than Nasa is
planning today.
International plans
Secondly, Nasa must change its mentality more quickly from a national space
agency to a partner in international programmes. Progress is being made.
This summer a three-way collaborative project was announced: a gamma-ray
observatory called Integral that will carry a US instrument on a European
satellite, to be launched by a Russian rocket in 2001. It is the first
mission designed from the start to involve Nasa, western Europe and Russia.
More would be welcome.
The European Space Agency's science programme, known as Horizon 2000, is
indeed looking increasingly attractive to some Americans as a model for
Nasa. Although a dozen European nations are involved, Horizon 2000 is less
bureaucratic than Nasa's big-is-best space science programme, and it is more
open to outside participation. Another great advantage is that Esa projects,
once approved, have far more stability of funding than similar Nasa
missions, which suffer frequently in Washington's annual budget battles.
If Observer remains lost in space, the lesson will not be to give up
missions to Mars but to stop putting Dollars 1bn into a single
interplanetary basket. Indeed the likely scientific dividends would justify
sending an international fleet of spacecraft to observe all the planets in
our solar system. But they need not be grandiose Nasa-style craft.

FT  26 AUG 93 / Rich pickings from the public: The role of Revenue
investigators
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tom Winship, investigations manager of the Inland Revenue Compliance Unit in
Slough, believes that most people are basically honest and willing to pay
their taxes. 'We are not in the business of putting people out of business.
We just want people to join our club and be contributors,' he says.
His team of four officers is one of the few branches of the Civil Service
that can show a financial return on its activities. For every Pounds 1
spent, it collects Pounds 5 from tax evaders.
'People are apprehensive of us but we do generally try to be understanding,'
he says. 'We don't seek to crush people to death. After all nobody likes
paying tax and we don't get a discount because we work here.'
Winship's team pursues unpaid schedule D Taxes - those levelled on the
self-employed. Slough has between 8,000 and 9,000 people registered to pay
schedule D, and the office investigates about 1,000 separate cases of
suspected evasion in that tax category every year.
'Many of our inquiries arise from telephone calls from informants and
anonymous letters,' says Beverley Stainer, a member of the compliance unit.
Her job is to develop and follow up leads by making house inquiries.
She also looks at specific occupations. One that tends to attract scrutiny
is taxi operations. Lists of licence holders are obtained from the local
authority by the unit and names are checked against lists of operators
provided by local taxi companies.
The Revenue officers use various profit and turnover statistics to check the
purported income of businesses, from public houses to taxis and cleaners.
These are collated on a district basis and help the officers decide whether
tax might have been unpaid.
'A taxi driver, for example, will always claim back his fuel costs, and we
can compare those against his takings in his accounts,' says Winship. This
makes it risky for drivers to carry passengers without using their meters,
and then claim back the cost of the fuel used on the journeys.
Licensed traders can also be a fruitful area for the compliance officers,
according to the team. Market stall holders and food-hawkers are regularly
checked.
Moreover, the team monitors the classified advertisements of local
newspapers, which might feature a rental property or advertise the services
of home entertainers, such as a magician or clown for children's parties.
'We can then check the name in the advertisement against our data base which
lists the names and addresses of each of the 24.5m people in the UK who pay
tax. If the name does not appear, the investigation begins,' says Stainer.
Sometimes individuals are referred to the office by the police. One referral
involved a man prosecuted for drug trafficking and found not guilty. He told
police that the Pounds 20,000 in Scottish Pounds 20 notes they found stored
under his bed had been legitimately earned.
When the man walked free from court, police made sure his earnings were
notified to the tax office. 'We accepted his story and came to an
arrangement whereby all the Pounds 20,000 was paid as tax,' says Winship.
In another case, a man who had never paid a penny of tax found he was
suffering from a terminal illness and came voluntarily to the office. His
life-savings of Pounds 60,000 were tied up in the value of his house. A tax
assessment was arrived at to pay over the whole amount and both parties
parted amicably.
The investigators are not always successful, however. They discovered one
boss of a manufacturing company who wanted to spend Pounds 15,000 on new
machinery. His accountants told him he could not afford it but he told them
he had some cash tucked away that the tax man did not know about. The man
was warned by his accountants that the purchase would be queried by the
inspectors.
Winship says: 'When we asked him how he came by the money he said he found
it in a paper bag on the bus. As proof he produced a receipt from the police
station where he had handed in the package and from where he retrieved it
when it was unclaimed. We believed him and moved on.'

FT  26 AUG 93 / Leading Article: A moment for truth in Bonn
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
TODAY'S meeting in Bonn between Mr Edouard Balladur, the French prime
minister, and Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany is a moment for sober
reflection on the troubles at the heart of the European Community. Because
this is their first encounter since the storm that blew down the exchange
rate mechanism, monetary matters will undoubtedly loom large. With the two
countries still at odds over agriculture, so will the EC's position in the
Uruguay round of multilateral trade negotiations. With Bosnia burning and
the European Community's role there under a deepening shadow, the two
leaders may find time to fret together about the former Yugoslavia.
But there is more at stake today than these individual issues. It is time
for the French and German governments to take a more fundamental look at the
strengths and weaknesses of their relationship, and to talk frankly about
their interests - both where they coincide and where they diverge.
Nobody should underestimate the underlying strength of the Franco-German
partnership. Taken individually, the issues that divide them are still
relatively minor compared with what they have in common. Divisions over
multilateral trade cannot detract from the economic integration that has
made each the other's largest trading partner by far. Disharmony over
exchange and interest rates should not eclipse the two governments' shared
desire to proceed towards a single currency. Neither these disputes nor
friction over foreign policy can call into question the role of the
Bonn-Paris axis as the driving force of the European Community. On the
contrary: when the relationship comes under stress, the instinctive reaction
in both capitals has long been to close ranks.
Unflappable Balladur
That is one way of reading the events since the collapse of the old ERM.
Despite the widening of currency trading bands, the ineffably unflappable Mr
Balladur has gone about his business as if little has changed, with a
downward tweak of interest rates here, a suggestion of closer economic
policy co-ordination there, and the occasional diatribe against currency
speculators. The Bundesbank, having cheekily urged its partners not to cut
and run after the debacle that it helped to provoke, may (just may) oblige
with a half-point cut in the discount rate today, enabling both countries to
pretend that they are on course together for the second phase of Emu.
Harmony will be restored, and the French will top it off - at a price - with
a promise to co-operate over the Blair House agreement with the US on
agricultural subsidies.
Franc fort
The problem is that these agreements, like many that have preceded them,
will deal with the symptoms of the malaise, not the cause. On the monetary
front in particular, Mr Balladur's understandable reluctance to admit the
demise of his franc fort policy still leaves him performing an awkward
balancing act between the needs of his domestic economy on the one hand, and
the dictates of European policy (and French self-esteem) on the other. The
former cries out for lower interest rates; the latter appears to dictate a
floor under the exchange rate. And if he continues to insist on
subordinating the former to the latter, he will depend as much as ever on
the whims - and perceived domestic policy priorities - of the Bundesbank.
Sooner or later as the political temperature in France rises, the two
imperatives seem bound to collide.
It is undoubtedly a horrible dilemma. What it - and the accompanying
political clamour in Paris - underlines is the way in which the balance of
power between France and Germany has shifted since German unification. For
all his public poise, Mr Balladur is crossing the Rhine today essentially as
a supplicant. It is Germany, more than France, that now has real policy
choices in Europe; and as the ERM debacle illustrates, post-unification
Germany will sometimes choose to subordinate the needs of European
co-operation to the interests of combatting inflation at home.
The underlying problem in the Franco-German marriage is that the two
countries have yet to conduct a full and frank discussion of how their
European ideals relate to their national interests. If today's meeting helps
to clarify that fundamental question, it will have served a useful purpose.

FT  26 AUG 93 / The temptations of forbidden fruit: The UK's blooming
informal economy poses a taxing dilemma for the government
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As the UK's fruit-picking season gets under way, the pretty apple orchards
of Kent and Sussex are teaming with what the Inland Revenue calls the
'ghosts' and 'moonlighters' who make up Britain's blooming hidden economy.
These phantom employees, for whom the Revenue has no records, work not just
in agriculture, but as waiters, cleaners, salesmen, mini-cab drivers and
decorators. They have one thing in common: not a penny of their earnings
finds its way to the exchequer. Their combined efforts make up the UK's
informal or hidden economy - legitimate economic activity that is not
declared for tax.
For a government that is looking at all areas of public spending to find
possible cuts or extra revenue, the informal sector would appear to provide
rich pickings. Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, has raised his
cabinet profile with a summer campaign aimed at saving Pounds 1bn by
stopping the 'selfish crimes' of social security fraudsters. Stepping up
efforts to crack down on tax evasion would seem the logical corollary.
But the absence of accurate figures on the size of the black economy - by
definition the transactions involved are not declared - makes it impossible
for the government to judge the tax losses involved. Moreover, the sums
involved in each case of tax evasion are usually petty. And so, although it
would not want to give the impression that it is lax in combatting tax
evasion, the Revenue sometimes turns a blind eye, focusing on those areas
where the returns are potentially greatest.
'There comes a point where it is not worth our while to chase evaders,' said
an Inland Revenue spokesman. 'We don't go for totally stupid amounts of
money. If somebody makes a Pounds 50 profit out of renting their drive to
people with cars during the Wimbledon championship, we are not interested.'
The Revenue cannot afford to be too complacent, however, because the number
of people making up the hidden economy has almost certainly grown in the
past few years.
Several factors might explain an expansion:
An unemployment rate of 10.4 per cent which has forced people to be more
enterprising in the ways that they earn money.
'There are clearly people who cannot get jobs in the formal economy but who
are interested in supplementing what they can get through social security,'
says Mr Stephen Smith at the Institute for Fiscal Studies. In the last
financial year, Department of Employment inspectors carried out more than
260,000 investigations into people who were claiming unemployment benefit
while also working.
The pressures on companies during a recession to collude with employees and
encourage them to sign on as unemployed while paying a low wage to top-up
state benefits. The Revenue believes such behaviour is more common among
smaller companies. 'Some companies might find it easier to survive by
slipping over the boundary of legitimacy,' says Mr Madsen Pirie, president
of the Adam Smith institute, the free market think tank. He adds: 'During a
recession you would expect the percentage of informal activity to increase
as a proportion of the total as some marginal legitimate businesses go by
the board.'
Changes to the structure of the labour market, including a move towards more
part-time, low-wage, service sector jobs. More flexible working practices
mean it is easier for employers to take on workers on an informal basis.
Caterers, for instance, could be paid in cash, but employing a car
production-line worker in a large factory would entail an employer filling
in official paperwork.
In spite of these factors, however, tax compliance remains relatively high
in the UK, compared with other European countries such as Italy and Greece.
The Revenue says the widespread use of the Pay As You Earn system, which is
administered by companies on behalf of the Revenue, makes it difficult for
most people to influence their tax bill. Out of 24.5m taxpayers in 1992-93,
about 21m were on PAYE. Economists and tax collectors say the simplification
of the tax system and the reduction of tax rates over the past 10 years may
have made it harder and less worthwhile to evade tax.
At the same time, while the number of people involved in the hidden economy
has probably grown, the value of the sector has been constrained as much by
the recession as legitimate activity. 'There may be more people offering to
tarmac drives, but there will be fewer people accepting,' says a Central
Statistical Office statistician.
Estimates of the size of the informal economy must take account of this
confusing picture. Some European countries make explicit adjustments to
their national accounts to reflect the value of informal activities. In
Italy, for example, the official estimate of the informal economy is about
16 per cent of GDP.
In the UK, the only indicator the CSO can offer is its so-called 'evasion'
adjustment, the difference between GDP measured by expenditure and GDP
measured by income and used to balance the national accounts. But the CSO
does not pretend that it gives an accurate picture of the size of the hidden
economy. 'We have enough trouble trying to get the formal structures of the
economy to add up, without having to worry about the hazy parts,' a
spokesman said.
Currently, the 'evasion adjustment' is equivalent to about 1 1/4 per cent of
total GDP, amounting to some Pounds 7.4bn in 1992. Government statisticians
consider that figure an understatement of the extent of informal activity.
Estimates by independent economists are probably more accurate but are still
open to doubt. Mr Smith, of the IFS, puts the value of the black economy at
between 3 per cent and 5 per cent of GDP, based on research into consumer
spending in areas where such activity is prevalent, for instance painting,
decorating, cleaning and gardening.
He says that even if as much as half of all consumer spending on such
services goes into the pockets of those failing to pay tax, the size of the
hidden economy would amount to no more than 5 per cent of national output.
The Revenue, however, thinks that figure is too low. It attributes a value
of between 6-8 per cent of GDP to the black economy, or up to about Pounds
50bn. 'This is the best estimate that we have been able to come up with,'
said a spokeswoman. 'It is a wishy-washy guesstimate.'
If the revenue's figures are broadly correct, it is recouping only a
fraction of the sums lost to the hidden economy. The special investigations
unit of the Inland Revenue responsible for targeting the 'ghosts' and
'moonlighters' that make up the informal sector collected Pounds 85.7m in
1992-93 compared with Pounds 71.3m in 1990-91.
In comparison Pounds 5bn, equivalent to between 2p and 3p on the basic rate
of income tax, was collected in 1991-92 from three other areas of the
revenue's efforts to ensure compliance with tax rules: investigations into
business accounts, wrong declarations in personal tax returns and the
enforcement of PAYE requirements. Much of that would have been the result of
mistakes or misunderstandings as well as some deliberate under-declarations.
Should the government be doing more? There is a case for making an example
of some defrauders on the grounds that tax evasion is a crime and that all
who are liable for tax should be treated equally. But there is also an
argument that the Revenue need not be more aggressive, because the returns
would be tiny in proportion to the time expended.
Many people failing to disclose their full income would still not be liable
to tax if their earnings fell below personal allowances - Pounds 3,445 for a
single person. At the same time, there are probably few people operating in
the hidden economy who are earning substantial amounts each year - and so
would be liable for significant sums of tax.
Another reason for the Revenue to hold off pursuing tax evaders is that a
bustling informal sector could be a sign of a healthy, enterprising economy.
Certainly, ministers are more vociferous about the need to tackle clearer
cases of social security fraud than in clamping down on tax evasion in the
hidden economy.
For this year's harvest anyway, it would appear that the 'ghosts' carting
apples, pears and plums around farms in south-east England are safe from the
probings of the tax inspectors. They will probably continue to be until the
money they earn amounts to the sort of sums in which the Revenue is
interested.

FT  26 AUG 93 / Book Review: The government as a 'stationary bandit'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN

<TEXT>
Dictatorship, Democracy and Development
By Mancur Olson
American Political Science Review, Sept 1993
A great deal was written, especially in the 1970s, on the economic tensions
affecting democracy. Competition for votes tended to generate unrealistic
expectations, contributing to the notorious overload on government.
Moreover, democratic government was infested with interest groups which
badly affected economic performance.
The more careful writers in this vein did not say that dictatorships would
perform better or as well as democracies. An American economist, Mancur
Olson, who himself pioneered much of the earlier interest group analysis,
has now gone on to analyse the endemic weaknesses of dictatorship. But,
first, he makes important observations on the advantages of one type of
dictatorship over another and of most types over anarchic violence.
His starting point is the same as that of the English philosopher Thomas
Hobbes: the need to prevent anarchic violence at almost all costs. The
victims of violence and theft lose not only what is taken from them, but
also the incentive to produce any goods for exchange with others.
The worst curse that can be suffered by a society in Olson's view is 'roving
bandits'. Where these are prevalent no security of property exists. It is
just as bad for the bandits; and one of the biggest gains in human history
is when a bandit leader seizes a given domain, becomes a 'stationary bandit'
and himself begins to expel all other roving bandits, as did the successful
Chinese warlords of the 1920s.
The rational stationary bandit will acquire a monopoly of theft, which he
will call taxes; but the taxes will be extracted in such a way that the
society still has some incentive to produce. For the stationary bandit will
be able to take more if he leaves his subjects with the means to generate
taxable income. 'Thus we have the first blessing of the invisible hand: the
rational self-interested leader of a band of roving bandits is led, as
though by an invisible hand, to settle down, wear a crown and replace
anarchy with government.'
Eventually the bandit establishes a dynasty and acquires respectability.
'History until relatively recent times has been mostly a story of the
gradual progress of civilisation under stationary bandits interrupted by
occasional episodes of roving banditry.'
More needs to be said, however, on the difference between autocrats, such as
the Bourbons and the Habsburgs, and the rule of the mafia. The word
'legitimacy', which Olson does not mention, must come into a full
explanation. Simply because it has been established for generations, a
dynasty acquires some basis of consent even if people are not fooled about
its origin.
There are other elements too. A successful legitimate government has more
undisputed control over its territory than mafia leaders, who are often at
loggerheads with each other as well as the official government and are less
able to protect the population. Thus mafia leaders have more of the
characteristics of roving bandits. Yet, if one leader comes out on top and
his family rules for generations, he too will establish a legitimate
dynasty.
Olson comes into his own in analysing the difference between the tax
behaviour of stationary bandits and democracies. A dictator or bandit will
want to maximise his own revenue and not care about the effect on the
national income provided that the tax-take is as high as it can be. However
modest his own needs, he has an unlimited stock of prestige projects or wars
of conquest that he wants to finance. A democratic government will care
about the effects on the population and not just on the government's
takings.
Of course, a democratic government might try to buy elections by
transferring income from a minority to a majority. But the majority will
still have a substantial market-generated income and thus care more for the
productivity of society than would an absolute ruler.
Olson has a less clear-cut theory of how democracy emerges. He falls back,
perhaps rightly, on accidents of history, such as occasions when an
individual who orchestrates the overthrow of an autocracy is not strong
enough to set up another autocracy of his own. This may leave a stalemate
and the need to work with other groups. But the danger surely is that such a
stalemate will produce not constitutional government, as in the case of the
English Glorious Revolution of 1689, but a weak state in which rival violent
groups flourish, as in Russia today.
Some pessimists have concluded that the autocrats who rule China and until
recently ruled Chile were right; and that the development of a flourishing
market economy must precede civil liberties and constitutional rule,
whatever the distortions and disadvantages. But there are other morals too.
The more successful record of the Czech Republic suggests that a rule of law
tradition, covering property rights as well as safety of the person, can
enable a constitutional democracy to preside over the re-entry to
capitalism.
Although Olson does not provide all the answers, he provides much more
stimulus and understanding than many holders of Nobel prizes and takes us
beyond the stale arguments on which so many social scientists are still
impaled.

<BYLINE>
   From Dr A S HEARNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Peter Carty highlights the bureaucracy likely to be created by BS7750
('Struggling with new standards', August 24). The bureaucracy will be
particularly severe for small and medium-sized companies. Rather than
increasing their international competitiveness it could decrease it, as a
direct result of increased administration costs.
Perhaps this would be acceptable if it led to improved environmental
performance. But this is not the case: the best we can expect is improved
monitoring of environmental performance.
The UK government is consulting about both BS7750 and its European Community
variation, the environmental management and audit scheme. However, the
assumption is that the bureaucratic route to improving environmental
performance has an important role to play.
This seems an unnecessary dilution of the government's attempt to relate the
environment directly to the marketplace. This can and should be done rather
than allowing the the accreditation and certification industry (which
includes the British Standards Institution) to add a further level of
non-productive costs to our hard-pressed businesses.
Let's deregulate this one before it does any harm.

European monetary union (2)
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr TONY HOCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Christopher Johnson proposes another half-baked scheme for monetary
union in response to the collapse of the previous one.
Immediately the goal of monetary union for members of a currency area is
set, the scope for speculation is increased. It is sensible and almost
inevitable in the interim period before the introduction of the single
currency that the markets will test the resolve of the authorities to remain
on track.
I am less convinced than Mr Johnson that the UK is underestimating the will
of its European partners to achieve monetary union. The final decision is
political not economic. When political resolve has been properly tested, as
at the time of German currency reunification, it has failed.
While the goal of monetary union based upon monetary stability is entirely
laudable, it is imperative that the political arguments are won before the
economic arguments begin again.

<TEXT>
Sir, What a dispiriting article by Christopher Johnson ('Still on track for
a single currency', August 23). He sees the achievements of the exchange
rate mechanism as reducing inflation, giving banks windfall profits during
the recession and providing the backdrop to the demolition of trade
barriers.
His third point perhaps has some merit but I would prefer to attribute the
welcome moves to the single market to affluence in the 1980s and political
unity. Trade language has stiffened as growth has slowed. It is true that
inflation in the European Community - Germany excepted - has been low in
recent years, as it has all over the developed world. But I do not accept Mr
Johnson's implication that, without the ERM, we would have high inflation in
Europe. Inflation in the UK was worsened by the shadowing of the D-Mark, as
was the recession by entry into the ERM and the two further years of high
interest rates. The deflationary pressure of high real interest rates in a
recessionary environment in France, Scandinavia and the Benelux countries,
required by the ERM, has been damaging.
Mr Johnson's second point is incredible. I am not averse to traders making
currency profits, and it was certainly true that the UK banks, in
particular, needed profits in order to rebuild balance sheets and prevent
monetary growth from stalling.
However, I am not sure large random cash transfers into the market from
central banks are a rational policy response. A main beneficial medium-term
impact of a fixed exchange rate system is competition on inflation rates,
yet the policy thrust of Mr Johnson's article is to recommend a move to
fixed real exchange rates.
It is sad that, after the damage caused by an ERM operating in conditions of
world recession and divergent EC economies, one can still read that 'the
case for one market, one money is as strong as ever'. Surely it should be
clear that, without political union, as in the US, monetary union is neither
sustainable nor desirable?

FT  26 AUG 93 / Conversion on the road to capitalism: Ukrainian coupons and
the art of motorcycle maintenance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRYSTIA FREELAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Yakov Eisenberg, director of Khartron, one of the two factories where
guidance systems for the Soviet Union's space and nuclear weapons programmes
were designed, is trying to muster enthusiasm for a new product: an orange
plastic, public transport token.
In his office in the eastern Ukrainian city of Kharkiv, he says with rather
forced gaiety: 'The scientist who came up with this had a really good idea,
and I am proud to say that I was part of the group that helped to make this
token a reality.' Holding the token to the light, he explains that it is
much cheaper to produce than the old, metal token and even harder to fake,
because it contains a sensitive metal strip.
But then Mr Eisenberg sighs deeply and explains: 'Of course, this sort of
thing is just a hobby for us. Our real work is to design guidance systems
for nuclear missiles and space shuttles. We are as good at that as anyone in
the world. But now we have no more orders.'
Sighs like Mr Eisenberg's can be heard all over Ukrainian factories, as
managers of some of the world's most sophisticated arms plants struggle to
adjust to the end of the cold war and the disintegration of their largest
market, the Soviet Union. The pervasive mood at many defence factories, once
the most cosseted and prestigious sector of the economy, is one of bitter
nostalgia.
For the Ukrainian government, striving to secure the new nation's
independence, conversion of the factories to civilian uses poses one of
country's most serious political and economic challenges.
More than 1.5m Ukrainian workers and as much as 40 per cent of the country's
industrial production were devoted to making arms when the Soviet Union
existed. That is roughly equivalent to the number employed by American
defence industry, but Ukraine's population is only 52m, compared with 249m
in the US.
The government's attitude towards conversion is ambivalent. Officials in the
capital, Kiev, realise that military factories, many of which are standing
idle but receiving state credits to maintain their workforces, are a drain
on the national budget and one reason why the inflation rate is running at
about 50 per cent a month.
But the government is unwilling simply to cut off the credits - loans which
are rarely repaid - and force those enterprises which are unable to convert
to consumer products to close.
Mr Vitalii Shmarov, deputy prime minister responsible for the defence
industry, says: 'We cannot just allow all of this tremendous technological
potential to die. If we do, our country will be reduced to the level of a
third world nation.' Mr Shmarov wants to allow some factories to carry on
making arms to sell abroad, and at the same time to subsidise others so that
they can switch to high-tech manufacturing.
However, Ukraine's parlous financial condition means the government's room
for manoeuvre is extremely limited. Economically, it cannot afford to keep
paying the credits; politically it cannot afford to stop them.
The Malyshev tank factory in Kharkiv, which makes the sophisticated Soviet
T-84 tank, illustrates the squeeze facing the government. Before the
collapse of the Soviet Union, arms, principally tanks, accounted for 70 per
cent of the plant's output. But Mr Hennadi Levchenko, manager, says that
since the first quarter of 1992 he has not received a single order from
Moscow for tanks.
Mr Levchenko and his workforce are trying to adapt: they have started to
make motorcycles and machines designed to extinguish oil-well fires. The
latter are tanks with water cannon mounted where the gun turrets would
normally be. So far, sales have not covered costs. Mr Levchenko, who has
kept a big stained-glass hammer and sickle in the foyer of his factory,
admits: 'Our civilian products are only bringing us losses.'
So how is the Malyshev factory surviving? 'We live on credits,' Mr Levchenko
concedes, estimating his factory's total 1993 debt at 12bn Ukrainian coupons
(Dollars 1.5m), most of it borrowed from the government at an interest rate
lower than inflation and unlikely ever to be repaid.
Even though the Malyshev factory is in the red and operating at just over
half its capacity, it maintains a workforce of 25,000. Mr Levchenko is proud
of providing his workers with 19 daycare centres, a recreation building and
two holiday health spas. He complains that the government has not given him
enough money to finish building a sports stadium.
For Mr Levchenko, conversion to non-military production is a waste of time
anyway. His main aim is to keep his workforce intact until the government
decides to build more tanks, preferably for countries in the new
Commonwealth of Independent States.
He wishes that the Ukrainian military still formed part of the Soviet armed
forces. If the split had not happened, as the Soviet Union broke up in
December 1991, he could have carried on supplying the entire Soviet Union
with tanks, he says. Now, Mr Levchenko hopes for the day when 'the Ukrainian
army becomes a real army and asks our factory to build it some new tanks'.
The Ukrainian minister of defence should, he says, 'be pounding his fist on
the table and demanding money for new weapons'.
Such views are shared by other managers of defence plants in eastern and
southern Ukraine, where many of the region's leading designers and
manufacturers of nuclear weaponry are located. Some western observers
suggest they are lobbying for a nuclear Ukraine. Mr Markian Bilinsky, a
British international affairs academic, says: 'Can you imagine the feelings
of loss of prestige of factories switching from making some of the best
military technology in the world to making ice-cream machines?'
In the south, in the city of Dnipropetrovsk, workers who once built
inter-continental ballistic missiles, for which Mr Eisenberg's enterprise
designed the guidance systems, are now producing machines to dry rose petals
for perfume. Further west in Mykolaiv, near the Black Sea, the shipyard that
produced all of the Soviet Union's aircraft carriers is switching to oil
tankers - which are more lucrative but considered so easy to build that the
factory manager dismissively refers to them as 'mere empty boxes'.
But despite the reluctance of many former arms makers to change either their
products or their methods, there is a groundswell of private enterprise
which is gaining momentum.
It is being prodded along by men like construction company owner Mr Stepan
Erdik, who thinks there could be a western market for the Malyshev factory's
four-wheel motorcycles. He has found a western partner, and they are buying
1,000 vehicles to sell in the UK and North America.
Although Mr Erdik, whose primary business is building houses and offices,
has only 300 employees, in contrast with Mr Levchenko's 25,000, it is the
former who is providing the finance for some imported motorcycle parts. He
also foots the bill when Mr Levchenko travels to trade fairs in the west.
Mr Erdik does not share Mr Levchenko's nostalgia for Ukraine's once mighty
defence sector. 'What is conversion?' he asks rhetorically. 'It is when
factories that made goods which were not needed by the people are forced to
make goods which the people want. I do not care if I am selling a tank or a
toy. What matters to me is whether people want to buy it.'

FT  26 AUG 93 / Letters to the Editor: Pay laws a barrier to equality
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Ms KATHY SUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your report that the Equal Opportunities Commission and the Trades
Union Congress are making representations to the European Commission about
the UK's equality pay protection highlights the fact that UK law fails to
guarantee fair and decent wages for women ('Brussels asked to rule on
Britain's equal pay laws', August 24).
Throughout the 1980s and into the 1990s the government has tried to
deregulate pay and employment conditions with policies that have
disproportionately affected and discriminated against women, who make up the
majority of people working in undervalued, low-paid and low-status jobs.
Over the same period European equality legislation has enabled women to
challenge deregulation and gain important new rights that have helped them
on the road to being treated equally in the workplace - equal pay for work
of equal value, equality in retirement and redundancy ages and, most
recently, the right to decent compensation in cases of sex discrimination.
The government argues that it is creating opportunities for women. But each
time it is forced to take action by Europe there has been no discernible
direct effect on the levels of women's employment. Indeed following the
introduction of the Equal Pay Act, women's employment actually rose.
The government's arguments are designed to disguise its opposition to
policies that attack the widespread undervaluing of women's skills and
contribution to the workplace. As wise employers know and understand, those
are the policies of yesteryears.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr LEONARD MANASSEH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your architecture correspondent, Colin Amery, does himself no credit
with his obituary on Alison Smithson ('A brutalist partnership dissolves',
August 23).
It is not so much an obituary as a continuation of his familiar polemic.
It is true that Mr Amery recognises and pays tribute to the Economist group
of buildings, but the remainder of the article reveals his visceral beliefs.
Mr Amery's right to his opinions and to air them is not in question, but the
brutal insensitivity of the headline and of the photograph illustrating his
piece were less than chivalrous.
There must be hundreds of photographs of the Economist building. The
selection, which can hardly have been accidental, of a view taken through a
fish-eye lens, with its ludicrous distortion, make his praise of the
buildings seem a little hollow.
Would that Alison were here to respond.

MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING (PG)
Kenneth Branagh
IN THE LINE OF FIRE (15)
Wolfgang Petersen
LE SAMOURAI (PG)
Jean-Pierre Melville
BENNY'S VIDEO (18)
Michael Haneke
A funny thing happened to Kenneth Branagh's Benedick and Emma Thompson's
Beatrice on the way to Messina, Sicily, the setting for Shakespeare's Much
Ado About Nothing. They were waylaid in Tuscany - much prettier - and
decided to film there. William Shakespeare, technical adviser emeritus,
murmured grudging approval from the grave; parched southern plains were
replaced by vine-clad northern hills; and signed-up Hollywood stars Denzel
Washington (Don Pedro), Keanu Reeves (Don John) and Michael Keaton
(Dogberry) could be made to feel at home in Italy's answer to California's
Napa Valley.
Much Ado About Nothing is a travesty, but oh what a lovely one. Having found
Branagh's Henry V near-unsittable-through as an essay in penurious
perversity - all that Olivier pageantry expelled, all those Olivier-dumped
conspiracy scenes shoved back in - I find myself all for perversity when it
is as glamorous as this. Filmed in eternal sunshine in the Villa
Somewhere-or-other, the Bard's darkest comedy is shaken about like
glittering gold foil. Even the melodrama scintillates. Poor Hero (Kate
Beckinsale), framed for infidelity by wicked Don John (Keanu Reeves in black
leather trousers) and spurned by fiance Claudio (Robert Sean Leonard), takes
the only course a young gel could in those days (the days of convoluted
Shakespearean subplots) and pretends to have died. But played for
serio-comedy by Branagh's mixed-race thespians, even this ancillary tale
takes on a loopy splendour. We are so colourfully discombobulated by the
anything-goes casting - Don Pedro a black American, Claudio a white American
and Hero's father a true Brit (Richard Briers) - that our minds home in on
what seems by comparison the darkly steadfast reality of the story.
As for Benedick and Beatrice, there is little scope for improvement.
Producer-director-star-adaptor Kenneth Branagh, after a talent search the
length and breadth of his living room, cast Emma Thompson as the haughty
love-spurning lady. The Oscar-fresh actress repays the kindness with a
delicious performance: it manages like fine wine to be at once rich,
intoxicating and amused at its own presumption. Branagh himself, bearded,
busy, bemused, his doughy face improved by baking in the sun, tosses the
lines about with as happy a comic dexterity as he juggles with an
anachronous deck-chair.
The Americans span a gamut from the excellent (Washington) via the adequate
(Leonard) to the awful (Keaton's hoarse-voiced Dogberry, Irishing away like
Barry Fitzgerald with laryngitis). But this film is, in the best sense, a
party. All who come are served; even the odd bore lends variety (provided he
is odd enough); and if, dear reader, you feel there can be no final excuse
for turning a Shakespearean play into a star-studded Tuscan travelogue, I
suggest that you go to see the film and get mugged by its magic as I did.
*****
The two greatest landscapes in American cinema are Monument Valley and Clint
Eastwood's face. That scorched, beaten-leather physiognomy is back again in
In The Line Of Fire. It fronts a plot more catchpenny than the majestic
Unforgiven - guns, chases, psychos, Presidential assassination bids - but
just as astonishing for its further revelation of Clint the icon.
He now resembles some photogravure from the old West, fissured with facial
fault-lines and landmarked with craters and ridges, who has been
inexplicably spirited to new Washington. The Eastwood voice goes with the
Eastwood face: a cracked, caressing whisper sandpapered by eternity. This
man surely spent his life standing at the edge of deserts, his features
sculpted by the sandstorms, his voice by the dehydrating winds?
But no: he has spent his life on the Californian coast where the only
deserts are inside film producers' brains. In The Line Of Fire is
medium-good Clint fare. That is to say, it has an idiotic plot redeemed by
the action set-pieces, the one-line wisecracks and Eastwood himself. He is a
White House-attached Secret Service veteran who longs to redeem his lapse
back in 1963 when he failed to stop the bullet that killed JFK. (Note the
dawn of the Failed Presidential Security-Man movie: see also Kevin Costner
in The Bodyguard, haunted by the bullet that passed him to hit Reagan).
John Malkovich, with cupid lips and psychotic purr, is the would-be assassin
of the new President, and JM and our hero spend much of the movie exchanging
verbal venom down a telephone line. This allows us to watch Eastwood
silently reacting to Malkovich's voice-off taunts and to savour the star's
parchment-textured phiz writing palimpsests of silent emotion onto the
screen. Later the film erupts into the streets and becomes far less scenic.
After Clint the Movie here is Hollywood the Puppet-Show. Everyone chases
everyone else down alleys, over rooftops and into assassination-ready VIP
banquets where the screams of the guests lie in wait with the silver-covered
entrees.
Germany's Wolfgang Petersen (The Never Ending Story, The Boat) joins the new
generation of Hollywood action directors drafted from Europe. Like Paul
'RoboCop' Verhoeven and Renny 'Cliffhanger' Harlin, he has a mechanistic
efficiency in action sequences and a Nordic delight in knife-twisting in
scenes of emotional stress or suspense. Would an American director, apart
from honest Clint himself in Unforgiven, portray Eastwood as quite such a
racked Grunewald presence? Or encourage the scene where our hero breaks down
in tears at the memory of that day in Dallas? After this, Eastwood looks as
if he could go straight into the histrionic heavyweight ring and give us
Buchner or Strindberg.
*****
Eastwood, like all iconic screen heroes, started impassive. So did France's
Alain Delon. We see him young in Jean-Pierre Melville's reissued thriller Le
Samourai (1967) where our (anti)hero is a walking mannequin in trenchcoat,
black hat and charismatic scowl.
Delon imparts a perverse, unyielding glamour to this plot about a gunman, a
girl (Nathalie Delon), another girl (Cathy Rodier) and a police inspector
(Francois Perier, fiendish, funny), all playing existential cat and mouse as
if they have just read Conrad's The Secret Agent in French. Delon kills for
hire; he keeps a caged budgerigar; he steals cars; he wears secret smirk.
These are all anti-social activities, but they are rendered magnetic - nay
more, mystical, profound, inviting - by that strange ability movie stars
have to make 'Keep Out' signs read like 'Come In'.
As in Eastwood's movie, nothing measures up to the central presence.
Jean-Pierre Melville is a modish name in cinephile circles and still
deserves respect for films like Les Enfants Terribles and L'Armee Des
Ombres. But Le Samourai is the fag end of first-generation French film noir:
a shadowy, blue-hazed teaser that twists and twirls its little plot of
betrayal and counter-betrayal amid sets and costumes that themselves betray
the incongruous dawn of 1960s hedonism.
*****
Benny's Video, by Austrian film-maker Michael Haneke, has an impassive
criminal for our own times. A boy with a bedroomful of video equipment
'motivelessly' kills a young girl: on camera, with a slaughterhouse gun, to
the accompaniment of her screams. His parents later see the offending video
and are shocked rigid. But they try to sweep away the evidence for Sonny's
sake. Then, weeks later, Sonny thinks, 'What a perfect opportunity to sweep
them away.'
This bleak, mordant, Ian McEwan-ish story is spun out to 105 minutes: a
length at which it starts to seem less like a darkly ingenious fable than a
single meretricious idea surrounded by quantities of narrative cladding.
Wait for Benny's Video the video, and be prepared to use the fast-forward.

FT  26 AUG 93 / Arts: Jonathan Miller's 'Ariadne' - Opera at Broomhill
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Besides its stepped lawns and gracious vistas, Broomhill - Sir David
Salomon's old country house near Tunbridge Wells - boasts its own little
Victorian theatre, virtually unused in this century. Four years ago the
tenor Kim Begley discovered it, and an idea was born. Since 1991 the
Broomhill Trust has arranged summer seasons of concerts and 'community
opera', and this year its First International Opera Course too. Meanwhile
the theatre has been carefully refurbished, with a fine orchestra pit
concealed beneath the stage (as at Bayreuth). Somebody must be thinking,
irresistibly, in mini-Glyndebourne terms.
On the strength of Broomhill's current Ariadne auf Naxos, that is not
unrealistic. Strauss's opera is on just the right scale for the place: it
was a pleasure to discover yet again how much more happily Ariadne plays in
a small house, with the reduced band for which he wrote so ingeniously.
(Bigger houses have to fatten the string-sections, at the sacrifice of a
certain appealing frailty - tackiness, even - in the orchestral sound.) But
it is no kind of piece for mere students; and in fact most of the
participants here are full-blooded young professionals, for whom the
Broomhill 'course' must count less as a study-camp than as an invaluable
public showcase.
The Broomhill music staff - headed by Jean Mallandaine and Courtney Kenny,
both of them distinguished keyboard assets (celesta and piano) to the
excellent Britten Sinfonia in the pit - have done their casting cannily and
well, with satisfying results. The cast I heard on Monday was more than
creditable, but there is a whole alternate cast as well: presumably not just
a second eleven, since they were scheduled for the Royal Gala performance on
Tuesday. I wish I could have heard them too. The quantity of well-schooled
operatic talent these days is astonishing.
Jonathan Miller is the director, far more at home with the Ariadne comedy
than he was recently with the verismo melodrama of Giordano's Fedora (for
Bregenz and Vienna). If Mark Bailey's vaguely Edwardian 'designs' seem
mostly cobbled together from rented costumes and the theatre's own faded
backdrops, they supply all that is needed - where the last Royal Opera
production provided an ultra-lavish, comedy-killing excess of everything,
and the last ENO one a glum hi-tech mess. It matters that the Ariadne
opera-within-an-opera is meant to be put on almost impromptu, in a Viennese
parvenu's Stadtpalais.
Strauss and his librettist Hofmannsthal meant their Ariadne o-within-an-o.
to be a farcical confrontation between lofty opera seria manners and earthy
commedia dell'arte. For assiduous British theatregoers, unfortunately, the
latter label has become attached to mannered, direly unfunny exercises.
Miller has had the good sense to scrap any 'commedia' associations in favour
of unabashed Cambridge Footlights knees-up style, and it works.
The brightest of his comics, William Dazeley as Harlequin, is a Cambridge
product, engaging enough to compensate for his somewhat gruff, un-tender
delivery of 'Lieben, hassen', the gem of his part as Strauss composed it.
The strenuously 'heroic' role Strauss wrote for his Bacchus, the god who
rescues the abandoned heroine from her death-wish, flatters hardly any tenor
(not since Jess Thomas, anyway), but Nicholas Buxton copes with it manfully.
His Ariadne is Rachel Sparer, a very tall American soprano: intelligently
musical, strongly projected (in a hard-ish timbre which awaits maturer
depths), too little sensitive to her visionary words - but with delectable
startled-moose reactions to the low-class commedia offensive. In this cast
the young Composer is Teresa Shaw, upon whose heartfelt 'Musik ist eine
heilige Kunst]' outburst Miller has foisted rather too many donnish tics and
twitches.
With their Zerbinetta, however - the Israeli-South African Sharon Rostorf -
the Broomhill Trust has struck gold. If her top Es are steam-whistles,
everything below those extravagant reaches is under insouciantly sexy
control. In clown's trousers, somewhere between raggedy-doll and
rag-and-bone man (like her commedia cohorts), she is artfully tough, funny
and self-aware, even when Miller makes her go randy over the legs of a
chaise-longue.
Perhaps Zerbinetta's topmost reaches will never be quite comfortable for
her; but the personality, the plucky coloratura and her wry aplomb should
take her a good long way.

FT  26 AUG 93 / Arts: Transfixed by Berkoff - The Edinburgh Festival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Edgar Allan Poe and Steven Berkoff: a marriage made in Heaven or perhaps for
some spectators Purgatory. Both favour the wilder side; both plough their
own imaginations; both choose the Gothic and place style before content. So
Berkoff performing Poe's Tell Tale Heart is an awesome experience.
The silences, and the slow drawing out of certain of Berkoff's favourite
words, like 'stealthily', are only matched by his rat-a-tat explosions of
action. As the mad man who murders the miser to avoid the stare of his fishy
blue eye, Berkoff is as well matched as a sweater to Edinburgh. And as the
drama proceeds from the slow laborious preparations for the killing to the
rising, insistent, reproachful beat of the dead man's heart as it pounds
from its hidden grave, so Berkoff winds up the audience to the pathetic
climax. Sometimes the words are strangulated beyond meaning; but the body
never fails to speak loudly and Berkoff even makes a virtue of mime. No one
climbs an imaginary staircase better; no one opens the door with more dread.
This is how Dickens must have transfixed an audience at his public readings
and if it owes more to Victorian excess, to the Henry Irving School of
acting than to sophisticated realism, that is spot on for Poe. Berkoff
brings death to life.
The other two monologues in his show at the Assembly Rooms are superficial
stuff, some rhyming nonsense about a failing actor, and an East End tough
singing the praises of his killer dog. But Berkoff uses his physical
presence to more effect than any rival and he makes a convincing case for
his self-proclaimed if slightly odd genius.
Twenty-three year old Crispin Whittell has hardly edged into the public
limelight as a dramatist but this year's Killing Him (The Pleasance) adding
greatly to the reputation he established last year with his play Success
must suggest a great future.
Black (or White) Wednesday is already an important historical date and the
tensions, both private, political and philosophical, that it generated are
superbly captured in Whittell's play. The dialogue cracks along, with City
slang, designed to make the awful seem palatable, running happily with
spouts of poetical lyricism. The style is so sharp that we take defeat and
murder happily in our stride. The four characters screw each other and
themselves to perfection but the moral survives beneath the wit in the
audience's total identification with the only decent character, an
unemployed birdwatcher. Wonderful acting; an unexpected treat.

A new series promising to shed light on events in 20th century history,
Document, begins on Radio 4 (7.20). This opening programme investigates why
the BBC and the British government kept so quiet in 1942 about evidence of
the systematic annihilation of the Jews despite the fact that the BBC came
under strong pressure to warn those in Hitler's occupied territories about
the 'final solution'.
It is a good night for fans of wildlife programmes. Survival reports on the
condition of the Andean condor, a vulture now found mainly in California and
the mountains of South America (7.30 ITV). The moment that ends, BBC1 begins
Nature Detectives (8.00) a new series which uses the expertise of
broadcasters such as those at the BBC Natural History Unit to help answer
wildlife questions raised by members of the public.
The repeat run of Pandora's Box, an unusual series about the change in
public attitudes towards science, shifts its attention to Africa, to Kwame
Nkrumah's plans in the 1950s to transform Ghana and the whole continent into
an industrial utopia by building the Volta dam (9.30 BBC2).

FT  26 AUG 93 / Arts: Schubert and Janacek operas - The Edinburgh Festival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This was a competition Janacek was always going to win. In the combative
world of opera the festival's two main featured composers had opposite
experiences: Schubert retired hurt aged 25 after a number of youthful
failures, while Janacek went on to compose a series of great operas in his
sixties, which rank as his most lasting achievement.
No fully-staged operas by either of them feature this year in Edinburgh's
programme (an important omission in Janacek's case). Instead, there was an
intriguing evening, which presented two rarely-heard operas in concert -
Schubert's Die Freunde von Salamanka and Janacek's Sarka. For opera-lovers
this may have seemed a raw deal, but it is always worth taking a risk with
rarely-heard operas in case they hold untold delights.
Janacek thought Sarka was a good piece himself. He wrote it in his early
thirties, which makes it one of his earliest works to survive, revised it,
failed to get it performed, revised it again late in life, and finally saw
it reach the stage as a 70th-birthday tribute. It only lasts an hour, but
into that time an epic in miniature is compressed.
The opera takes place way back in Czech mythological history. An army of
warrior women is roaming the land in protest against male domination,
beating the men at their own game and causing consternation in the male camp
at the daring exploits of their boldest fighters. No, Janacek is not about
to raise his voice in the cause of women's rights; his interest had been
taken by the nationalist undercurrent of the plot, which can be read as a
call to emulate the heroes of Czech mythology.
No doubt that is why the music is so impassioned. The score proceeds in fits
and starts, but its ideas are consistently strong, vivid, uplifting, because
the composer wanted Sarka to make an impact. Among its best moments are a
love duet built of disjointed musical motifs in the mature Janacek manner
and a final act (all of 15 minutes long) which is a Wagnerian threnody for
the fallen hero. The interest rarely slackened in this lively performance by
the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra under David Robertson.
It was also well sung. Sarka, the warrior maid who ambushes and murders the
man whom she then decides she loved, looks potentially a beast of a
character, but Helena Kaupova sang her music with calm and dignity. William
Kendall brought some strength to the hapless Ctirad; the supporting roles
were well taken by Christopher Ventris and Neal Davies.
Next to this, the 18-year-old Schubert's Die Freunde von Salamanka (wisely
performed first) is an apology for an opera. Nice people, an inoffensive
story, no dramatic tension whatsoever and music which is so charmingly
insubstantial that one puff of the Janacek blew it all away. Despite a
decent cast of middle-ranking British singers, this concert performance
showed that at 90 minutes, it is far too long. Wise young Schubert to give
up opera and move on to better things.

FT  26 AUG 93 / People: Stevens takes the stage at Carnegie
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Simon Stevens, head of international equities at fund managers Invesco, has
been headhunted by Carnegie Group to run its UK arm, Carnegie International;
he replaces Lars Bertmar, who remains the broker's group chief executive.
Invesco, which has been through a turbulent few years, is just beginning to
repair its UK operation, and, after a wave of departures, seems to be
stemming the staff exodus. But 41-year-old Stevens (right) says 'it is all
about opportunities and how well they fit your aspirations and character'.
He has a high respect for Bertmar as 'a thinker' and approves of his
strategy of concentrating on niche markets, in this instance particularly
southern Europe.
Carnegie has itself suffered some upheaval. At the end of 1991, Bertmar, a
former corporate financier at Svenske Handeslbanken, sacked the three senior
managers of Carnegie International, and took responsibility for London
himself.
Stevens' job will be to market the services of the analysts around Europe,
'to make sure the product is appropriate for the UK market' as he puts it.
The Spanish and Portuguese teams already top the Extel ratings in their
country sectors. Bertmar also has ambitions to build a corporate finance
capability in those countries, from Spain to Turkey, where there is
brokerage expertise.
While he has not worked inside a merchant bank's corporate finance division,
Stevens spent a couple of years in the corporate planning department of
Grand Metropolitan and held a similar job at Ocean Transport and Trading.
Stevens may soon find himself working for a new owner, as Carnegie's parent,
the troubled Swedish Nordbanken, said more than a year ago that its
profitable brokerage subsidiary was up for sale in order to allow it to
concentrate on domestic banking business.

FT  26 AUG 93 / Technology: Consultant's critique - Software at Work
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN GRUMBALL

<TEXT>
Code books conventionally hide information. The Memex Information Engine
uses them to retrieve it. In the system, every word in a document can be
reduced to a code of between one and three characters. If the average word
has six letters there is a compression of about 3:1. This reduces the space
required to store the information.
When looking for specific words in the database, the search program examines
the code book for each document. If the words do not appear at all in a
document there is no
need to look at the full text. This speeds things up. Huffman encoding, a
more advanced version of this idea, has been around for decades. Nearly
every leading data compression utility uses some variant of it. Memex has
spotted how encoding can be used to real advantage in searching - the heart
of document management.
Traditional document management systems use indexes. Important words -
'keywords' are identified and these are stored like labels to aid future
searches. Often this is done manually and it is error prone. The Memex
system searches more effectively because all the words in a document act as
keywords. A simple example was a hunt for a car used in a crime. The Holmes
database produced 40 suspects. Trace turned up a further two that had been
missed. Trace has allowed Central Scotland Police to integrate information
from a wide range of sources. The Police National Computer cannot search for
car registrations when one letter is known. Trace can, by searching a dump
of car details taken from the PNC. Data from many sources can be combined to
extend the searches.
I liked the graphical front end, especially the integration of voice and
video. Memex seemed to have spent time getting close to the police and
tailoring the system to their needs. Everyone appeared to like the system
and said it would help them do their job better.

FT  26 AUG 93 / People: Further Education Quality Council
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR BOB REID, the chairman of British Rail, is to monitor standards in
England's further education colleges. He will be the inaugural chairman of
the Further Education Quality Council, a council set up under the
government's auspices to ensure that adult education institutions are
spending public money well and efficiently.
Further education is somewhat unlike British Rail in that the government has
ambitious plans to expand it over the next few years as part of its move to
increase the numbers of students who stay in education after the age of 16.
However, like British Rail, the colleges have recently undergone a period of
turmoil as they were transferred from local education authorities to direct
government control at the beginning of April.
By appointing Sir Bob, who can expect to find the post demanding albeit
part-time, the Further Education Funding Council for England also hopes to
signal its determination that FE colleges will be guided by the needs and
demands of industry. Four other industrialists - who have yet to be chosen -
will sit on the council, along with five members from the world of further
education, and one student.

FT  26 AUG 93 / Technology: Detectives of the database - Police in central
Scotland are no longer dominated by form-filling since project Trace, an IT
system that allows access to a wealth of intelligence / Software at Work
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLAIRE GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It's a bad week for criminals in central Scotland. Coming online in Alloa is
a computer system that can take information in any form available - paper,
voices, video frames, mugshots - and search for coincidences and common
factors across a series of crimes.
By linking with existing databases and making free-text searches across all
sorts of data, the police can make the most of even fragments of
information, such as the colour of a van and just one letter of its number
plate. The Criminal Intelligence Application is the second phase of a
project called Trace, which has already cut paperwork in half since the
first phase went live at the end of March.
Now it is enabling the police to make connections between events, crimes,
locations, even rumour, hearsay and the background knowledge that comes from
years of experience. Walk into any police station to report a lost dog, and
the paperwork takes at least 20 minutes. Form-filling is the tedious but
essential part of policing and it steals time from activities the public
sees as more important: patrolling and solving crimes.
Once a charge is made, the paperwork escalates and accuracy is vital: poor
paperwork provides legal loopholes. Central Scotland Police confirmed their
worst suspicions when investigating procedures two years ago - the same
information was often filled in up to 27 times on various forms.
The research team interviewed nearly 300 officers of all ranks, with
experience ranging from six months to nearly 30 years. The examination
included the end-purpose of the paperwork: what elements were vital for the
Criminal Justice System, the Crown Office and other ultimate users outside
the police.
'I was looking for a system that would make the front line policeman's job
easier and cut down on the paperwork they are inevitably required to do,'
explains William Wilson, the chief constable of central Scotland. He was not
alone in feeling these needs would not be met by 'off the shelf' solutions
available from the main suppliers of police systems, including McDonnell
Douglas and Bull.
Wilson sits on the Police National Computer board and represents Scotland on
the police Technical and Research Committee. In his previous job as deputy
chief constable in Fife, his interest in technology led to a joint
development with Memex, whose software he had discovered on the police
grapevine.
The software, called the Memex Information Engine, enables users to make
fast, free-text data retrieval (Textract) across a number of different
databases. Several systems already help the police in various areas: PNC2,
the Police National Computer and Holmes, used to co-ordinate significant
investigations.
Central Scotland wanted a system that would give them access to all these
existing resources and their own databases, cutting out repetitive
paperwork. They got that and more - a system that could provide real
'intelligence' and the ability to make connections.
For police use, the system has been tailored into a product known as CCIMS -
Crime and Criminal Information Management. The central Scotland
implementation, Trace, goes one step further according to Wilson. 'It gives
us the edge in terms of technology. I like to think it's a new era for
policing.'
The project required special funding and an investment in manpower,
involving two senior inspectors for two years.
The development principles were that everyone on the force should be able to
use the system, (unlike the PNC2 computer), and that it should adhere to all
existing standards, both technical - such as Gosip, the communication
standard - and those used internally in the police and justiciary. It also
had to provide 24-hour access to existing databases and be user-friendly for
first-time users.
Text retrieval often relies on the text being pre-indexed for keywords.
Free-text retrieval allows any word or part of a word, even an approximation
of it - known as a 'fuzzy match' - to be sought and matched.
The Memex Textract software gets round the problem of slow retrieval due to
storing enormous amounts of information by compressing data, using special
codes and algorithms. Its speed enables it to capture new data generated by
everyday incidents and police work and connect it with other available
sources.
'People are restricted by budget, but the beauty of this solution is that it
doesn't force you to abandon investment or change direction, because it can
work with almost any existing database,' says Wilson.
Inspector Peter Watson has led the Trace project since the initial research.
'One of the overriding considerations was that it had to allow expansion
with ease. The system isn't just representative of the force workload, it is
the workload. It's been designed to facilitate everything the officer does,'
says Watson.
The next step, coming into force this week, is a multimedia extension, the
Criminal Intelligence Application, which brings video clips, paper records,
photographs and voice data onto one screen.
One demonstration of the extensions uses a real example - a search based on
a recorded telephone conversation, reported by a radio amateur. The name of
a local wood, a villain's nickname and the mention of a manhole cover,
became search elements that put the police onto a leading drug ring.
'Without the Textract facility, that tape might have gone into someone's
drawer as interesting but useless data and never been exploited for what it
could tell us,' says Detective Constable Tom Newlands, a member of the Trace
team. 'It's very flexible: it can take its data from any media, any source,
from old black and white prints, to electronic-input,' says Newlands. 'It
can also compress a PNC2 dump to one fifth of its size.'
A screen menu details every form-filling task possible: results of
breathalyser tests, statistics reports, property crimes, lost and found
register. A high proportion of information is available through default, so
that certain items appear on the screen automatically, saving keystrokes and
increasing accuracy. Every address and post code in the area is on file.
When in doubt, a user can 'point and pick' from a look-up table of options,
such as crime codes.
Wilson does not plan an assessment until the system has been in place a
year, but benefits are already visible, such as the few seconds it takes to
check an address.
According to Inspector Tom Sneddon, an everyday end-user of Trace at Alloa,
a lot of information that was not immediately relevant used to be lost. 'The
problem is that you never know exactly what might be useful. Now it just
sits there - it's there when we need it.'
Benefits in local information-sharing with Fife are also apparent, and
Wilson is keen to see the system adopted elsewhere: 'I never envisaged it
being as comprehensive as it now is. We started with log entries and basic
crime reports. Now we've gained a distinct head in terms of technology and
the individual officers are the main beneficiaries.'

BUZZWORDS
FREE-TEXT RETRIEVAL describes the storage, search and retrieval of large
quantities of word-based data, now also known as 'full information
management'.
A SOUNDEX SEARCH retrieves all words of the same sound but varied spelling.
A fuzzy match allows a search to be made on an approximation of a word.
A WILD CARD SEARCH looks for any number of characters which might explain an
indistinct word: Torloisk, recorded in the drugs raid, was found to be the
name of a wood by searching an intelligence database of previous drug cache
locations.

NATURE OF BUSINESS
Central Scotland Police is the second smallest of Scotland's eight forces.
With its headquarters in Stirling, it covers an area of approximately
1,000sq miles between the Forth and Clyde estuaries. It is divided into two
territorial divisions and runs six local command units.
EMPLOYEES: Around 800, including an establishment strength of 649 officers
and 150 civilians.
CRIME STATISTICS: Reported crime within central region has shown a decrease
to April 1993 of 1,974 crimes, 7.9 per cent down on the previous year, with
a detection rate of 55.9 per cent.
KEY PERSONNEL: Chief Constable William Wilson, Inspector Peter Watson, Trace
project leader, Detective Constable Tom Newlands, Trace development and
specification, based in Alloa.
TECHNOLOGY FILE
SOFTWARE: The Trace system, Total Retrieval Administration Crimes and Events
 -is based on Memex software for text information retrieval called the Memex
Information Engine. With development and implementation from Central
Scotland Police, Memex has made this into a police product, Crime/Criminal
Information Management System CCIMS, already used by Fife Constabulary,
under the name Focis, Fife Occurrence and Crime Information System. (Trace
works on PCs and Unix workstations and 'bolts on' as a front end to existing
databases.)
Currently all connections to other databases such as PNC2 are ad hoc, but a
permanent live link with the Crown Office and the Procurator Fiscal is
planned in November.
SUPPLIER: Memex, now based in East Kilbride, was founded by Edinburgh
academics, Fred Heath and Graham Woyka, in 1979, and was bought by
microfiche supplier Microfilm Reprographics Data Management in 1991. Memex
had a turnover of pounds 1.4m in 1992-93.
HARWARE: A central Sun Sparcserver 670, in a distributed X25 network with 4
Sparcstations, 2 computers, all running under the Unix operating system. It
supports 320 dumb terminals, 25 intelligent terminal Sun X-stations and two
PCs for imaging.
VALUE OF SYSTEM: Cost was about pounds 900,000 with about half, pounds
550,000 accounting for hardware and communications.

FT  26 AUG 93 / Accountancy Column: Annual report with a difference boosts
ethical approach - An unconventional company which applies 'social'
guidelines to its trading strategy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A HIGHLY unusual document has been circulating in the boardrooms of the
FT-SE 100 companies in the last few weeks. It is a plea for greater
accountability and information; and its source is not a pressure group, but
a rival business.
The request comes in the form of a document designed to lead by example; an
annual report with a difference called a 'social audit'. Its aim is to
assess the social impact and ethical behaviour of the company in relation to
its aims and those of its 'stakeholders'.
The 20-page glossy brochure provides background on topics such as the
breakdown of costs and profits throughout the production process of a sample
of products, a description of some of its suppliers, and figures on the
composition and salary scales of the workforce.
The source for this information is an extremely unconventional company
called Traidcraft. Founded in 1979 in Newcastle upon Tyne, the business
imports food, clothing and handicrafts from groups in the Third World. Its
aim is to promote 'fair trade' by buying at what it considers just prices
from suppliers who promote social and economic development in their
communities.
Some of its principles have been challenged in the last few years by a
deficit which threatened its future. It has changed management and
restructured with the aim of being profitable and paying dividends.
However, the new mood has not removed the directors' determination to keep
sight of at least some of their radical origins. Traidcraft maintains a
policy of offering the highest-paid employee no more than three-times the
wage of the lowest. Its objectives of promoting fair trade remain. Its
social audit report is a development out of these concerns.
The idea of social auditing is not new. In a booklet* produced earlier this
year by the company in conjunction with the New Economics Foundation, an
alternative economics think-tank, it lays out the history of the process in
the last 20 years. The authors are Richard Evans, Traidcraft's external
affairs director, and Simon Zadek from the foundation.
In 1971, there was a social audit of the Upper Clyde Shipbuilders. A number
of similar assessments in the UK and US were carried out during the decade
by Social Audit, established by the Public Interest Research Centre, largely
without the co-operation of managements.
Pressure for greater disclosure by companies developed, with guidelines from
the Confederation of British Industry and limited extra disclosure
requirements in successive pieces of company law covering political and
charitable contributions and employee welfare.
In other countries, there has also been considerable attention paid to
social accounting issues beyond the narrow confines of financial
performance: companies in the Netherlands, Sweden, Germany, the US and India
have produced reports.
But the authors argue that the missing ingredients have been anything
systematic, comprehensive and regular. They are often focused around one
particular event such as a factory closure, only consider certain products
or regions, became rapidly dated, may be superficial, and typically are not
independently verified. There is also no framework to help guide disclosures
and make them consistent.
Traidcraft's recent efforts certainly try to address these limitations. Its
first tentative steps took place last year with a document called 'Towards a
Social Audit'. It profiled two of its suppliers, analysed changes in its
product range, made reference to market research into its mail order
customers, and described its environmental impact. The full 1992-93 social
audit document and process - which cost Pounds 20,000 - goes rather further.
It considers its ability to maintain growth in sales and continuity of
orders to help producers, the proportion of sales derived from the Third
World, and shareholder participation.
The picture that emerges is not entirely positive: purchases fell from its
profiled region - the Philippines - because of the UK recession, failure to
generate sufficient revenues under Traidcraft's minimum target sales and
inability by a supplier to deliver a promised product range. It documents
concerns by some producers that the company failed to communicate
sufficiently.
The report on employees raises some concerns about whether the company
should pay a greater wage to those at the lower end of the salary scale, and
on the ambivalence of non-Christian staff to the company's policy of only
allowing Christians to sit on the board.
On environmental issues, it admits it has generally been unable to trace
products to source to judge whether they are produced sustainably.
A three paragraph 'auditor's report' written by the New Economics Foundation
is not entirely positive. It says: 'We are satisfied that the (report) . . .
offers an adequate basis for understanding key aspects of the social impact
and ethical behaviour of Traidcraft in relation to its aims and those of its
main stakeholders for the period in question.'
But it goes on to endorse the need to continue to develop the social audit
method, apply more specific indicators and targets, focus on the
effectiveness of lobbying and education work, give further emphasis to
environmental aspects and develop additional forms of social book-keeping to
ease the audit.
Traidcraft admits to a number of difficulties. It stresses that the report
will evolve in the future, and that only next year can it begin to assess
performance. It argues that it is difficult and dangerous to quantify too
far, or to add up different numbers to attempt to produce a single overall
figure of social profit or loss.
There are, nevertheless, a number of weaknesses in the report. It fails on
several occasions to clearly lay out its objectives and then assess them:
using a graph which is all but impossible to read to highlight the growth in
goods sourced from the Third World, for instance.
The report makes little attempt to justify its choice of assessment criteria
or show how they are audited - though much evidence according to the
'Auditing the Market' booklet is apparently to be based on discussions with
staff - which does not seem appropriate for issues such as how to assess the
impact of its educational activities.
It often cites highly anecdotal evidence, such as that there has been a 69
per cent increase in the last year on the time spent visiting producers to
work on product design and development. This is interesting but smacks of
gathering anything available rather than systematic probing.
It raises the wider question of how far the profiles of suppliers are always
likely to be self-justifying. A producer of handicrafts may sound worthy of
support because it also sponsors social welfare programmes in the community.
But would the money be spent more productively or efficiently given to
another local group whose sole concern was these social issues?
In addition, It reflects the inadequacy of any attempts so far to meaningful
define 'fair trade' in any but very general terms. That will clearly hamper
any effects to genuinely assess the company's effectiveness.
More fundamentally, it highlights the fact that even the highly unusual
shareholder base is apathetic and happy to let the company do its work.
Without active discussion of its objectives, how can Traidcraft effectively
debate what its ethical and social priorities should be?
Given the difficulties in yet refining its own methodology, let alone its
rather unusual shareholder profile, it is also difficult to see many other
companies following Traidcraft's lead in the short-term: welcome though that
would certainly be.

FT  26 AUG 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Italy plays by new
rules - A code of conduct to police the bidding procedures for state
advertising contracts has received a mixed reception
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shaken by the involvement of some of their most prominent members in alleged
kickbacks to politicians, in return for public-sector campaigns, Italy's
leading advertising agencies have drawn up a new code of conduct to protect
against future abuses.
But some advertising executives fear the new rules, which will create a
supervisory body to police bidding procedures for the contracts, could
stifle, rather than encourage, competition. And not all are convinced that
self-regulation and more open bidding are enough to regulate Italy's
advertising industry.
'The aim is to create a level playing field,' says Alberto Contri, chairman
of the association of leading agencies. Contri, elected chairman earlier
this year, speaks with some authority. Medicus Intercon-Feel Good, the
agency he runs, specialises in publicity for the pharmaceutical and health
sectors, where most of the alleged abuses occurred.
The new code of practice aims to remove any scope for corruption by ensuring
that all future state advertising campaigns be solicited exclusively through
public tenders.
It has already attracted attention in other countries where uncompetitive
business practices, such as 'voluntary' contributions to a politician's
electoral expenses, are believed to take place.
Foreign interest has been reinforced by the arrests of executives at Italian
subsidiaries of at least two of the world's leading agencies. Even more
embarrassing for the agencies is that the inquiries, which relate to alleged
kickbacks to win business in the health ministry's big anti-Aids campaign,
involve such a sensitive health issue.
The allegations emerged last month after Giovanni Marone, secretary to a
former health minister under investigation for alleged political corruption,
began to reveal to magistrates how some ministerial advertising contracts
were won.
According to Marone, whose testimony has been widely leaked, some agencies
paid hundreds of millions of lire to Francesco De Lorenzo, Italy's former
health minister. Disguised as 'campaign contributions', the payments were
actually kickbacks to win lucrative public sector advertising contracts.
De Lorenzo, who resigned earlier this year after being put under
investigation for an alleged jobs-for-votes scam in his native Naples, is
now being investigated for a much wider range of allegations of political
corruption, including kickbacks from some of Italy's leading drugs
companies.
Marone's revelations led to a string of arrests in the advertising industry.
Those involved included the former and current managing directors of the
Italian subsidiary of Young and Rubicam; Claudio Maria Masi de Vargas
Macciucca, the managing director of Publicis FCB MAC Italy, the Italian
joint venture of Foote, Cone &amp; Belding and Publicis of France; two directors
of Armando Testa, a Milan-based agency, and an employee of DAPS, a local
media buyer.
Enforcement of the new code of practice is to be supervised by a special
committee, comprising judges and senior advertising and public relations
executives. Agencies will be required to inform their trade association what
tenders they intend to bid for, and the supervisory committee will examine
all tenders to ensure they are suitably transparent.
Should an agency suspect a contract is being awarded unfairly, it must
denounce the proposed campaign to the supervisory body. The same applies in
cases where some of the terms, such as abnormally short preparation periods
to submit proposals, suggest the bid might be rigged. The aim, according to
Contri, is to ensure contracts are won on the basis of 'real factors, such
as professional competence, experience and the nature of the services
offered'.
But do the rules go far enough to stamp out malpractice? Public tendering
has been proposed as a panacea in other Italian industries, such as
construction, where it is alleged that big kickbacks are regularly paid to
politicians to win business.
'Public tenders may help to eradicate malpractice in industries, such as
building, where the bidding criteria are relatively clear and contracts can
be allocated on objective grounds, such as cost,' says one prominent
advertising executive. 'But it's harder to apply the same standards to
advertising.'
Another observer warns that even public tenders can be rigged. 'If enough
people want to cheat the system, they can do it,' he says.
The new rules should at least stamp out some of the most shocking excesses
of the past, such as limited private tenders, with the winner decided in
advance. They should also eliminate the so-called 'public' bids, where odd
rules, such as abnormally short preparation times, may have masked similar
malpractices.
Whether they will be enough is still not certain.

FT  26 AUG 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Selling Atlanta to
the world
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARBARA HARRISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Atlanta, the leading business city of the southern US, has become the first
city to promote itself through a worldwide television marketing campaign.
The city is attempting to lure foreign investment through a series of TV
advertisements to be shown on the cable TV service CNN International. The
campaign has been prepared by BBDO, the US-based advertising agency, for the
Atlanta Chamber of Commerce.
Atlanta has long had a reputation for self-hype. In the 1920s it was the
first city to advertise itself in print.
In its latest campaign Atlanta has targeted European and Asian business
audiences with 30-second TV adverts. CNN, widely available in international
hotels, started showing the adverts last month. They are screened in the
early morning, as business travellers prepare for their day, and in the
early evening, as they return to their hotels.
Atlanta's three-year campaign, costing at least Dollars 1m, (Pounds 676,000)
aims to build on the publicity that will come when Atlanta hosts the 1996
summer Olympics.
'The Olympics give us a unique window of visibility,' says Bill Crane, the
chamber's marketing director.
The initial advert simply tries to establish an identity for the city,
according to Tod Martin of BBDO. It tackles international unfamiliarity with
Atlanta by showing it as home to companies such as Coca-Cola and Delta
Airlines. As the Olympics approach, the adverts will increase in number and
length, says Crane.
Atlanta is unlikely to be the last company to promote itself around the
world on TV. The possibilities of this kind of marketing are just being
discovered with the advent of worldwide television broadcasting networks
such as CNN and BBC's World Service Television.

FT  26 AUG 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Investing in France
 -Agencies are preparing campaigns for the first wave of a privatisation
drive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It sounds like a marketing nightmare. Over the next few days Andre de Marco
must finalise the preparations for one of the most important product
launches in his company's history. Yet he still does not know exactly what
he will be selling, or when it will go on sale.
The product is a block of shares in Rhone-Poulenc, the flagship French
chemicals company, the French government hopes to sell this autumn in the
first phase of its privatisation drive. Unfortunately for de Marco,
Rhone-Poulenc's director of communications, the economy ministry will wait
until the last moment to announce the size and date of the sale.
'With an ordinary marketing campaign you are able to choose the best
possible time to make sure that conditions are right,' he says. 'But we have
no control over the timing of our issue, or over whether the government will
sell its full 43.4 per cent stake. All we can do is make sure that
everything is ready to go anytime from early September.'
Rhone-Poulenc is not alone. Banque Nationale de Paris (BNP), the other
first-phase candidate, is also putting the finishing touches to its
marketing campaign. Even companies earmarked for sale in the second phase,
likely to be early next year, such as the Elf Aquitaine oil group, are now
starting to plan the marketing of their issues.
These companies not only need to ensure that they attract enough interest to
sell all the shares, but that the stock ends up in the right hands to create
a stable base of shareholders. The marketing of the issues will play a
critical part in this process through mainstream advertising to the public
and through specialist communications to institutional investors in France
and other countries.
The specialist programme is likely to be the most straightforward. Most of
the privatisation candidates are large, international groups which have a
small percentage of their equity in public issue. They have already invested
heavily to build up a core of institutional shareholders and to ensure they
are well known in the international financial community.
'French companies have made tremendous progress in communicating with
international investors,' says Joe Hall, head of international sales at
Warburg Securities in London. 'The first catalyst was the mid-1980s
privatisation drive, but things have really improved over the last three or
four years when foreign institutions have become major investors in France.'
The most expensive, and challenging, aspect of privatisation marketing is
advertising to the public. There is no real tradition of private share
ownership in France and the 1987 stock market crash brought the mid-1980s
vogue for equity investment to an abrupt halt. The economics ministry says
it may consider a follow-up to this summer's successful Balladur bond
advertising campaign to encourage investors to convert bonds into
privatisation shares, but it has no plans to promote share ownership as
such.
This means the privatisation candidates must not only sell themselves, but
also try to popularise the concept of share ownership.
Elf has already started. It has expanded the corporate advertising campaign
originally planned for this summer. The campaign, devised by the Euro-RSCG
agency, features posters of childhood snapshots of mythical Elf employees.
The company has added an extra picture of 'Louis, an Elf shareholder' to
highlight the forthcoming share sale. Elf is preparing to choose an agency
to handle the main privatisation campaign. However, its scale will be
determined by how much of its 50.7 per cent stake the government decides to
sell. If the issue is small Elf may concentrate its efforts on the
institutions as it did for the partial privatisation.
BNP caused a stir in the Paris advertising world last week by choosing BDDP,
one of the most dynamic new French agencies to have emerged in the 1980s,
rather than its long-standing agency, Euro-RSCG. The choice of BDDP, which
worked for Michel Pebereau, the BNP chairman, on CCF's privatisation
advertising, is expected to herald a new image for BNP, one of France's most
traditional banks.
The group plans to reinforce its advertising efforts by an extensive direct
mail campaign to its 60,000 employees and 4.7m account holders to
familiarise them with Pebereau's new strategy and to encourage them to buy
its shares.
Rhone-Poulenc last week helped to console Euro-RSCG for the loss of the BNP
account by appointing the agency to handle its privatisation advertising.
Like Elf, Rhone-Poulenc's efforts will depend on the ultimate size of the
issue. One of its main aims is to attract more individual investors. It
currently has 100,000 private shareholders who own less than 1 per cent of
its total equity.
'If we want to build a well-balanced shareholder base we've got to attract
more individual investors,' says de Marco. 'Privatisation provides an ideal
opportunity. But it won't be easy. Most people in France know the name
Rhone-Poulenc, but they're not really sure what we do.'

FT  26 AUG 93 / Crown Agents welcome an independent role: The future of the
procurement organisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT last week made a significant compromise in its privatisation
strategy for the Crown Agents, which provides financial, professional and
procurement services across the developing world.
After eight months of deliberation it retreated from its early preference of
outright privatisation, opting instead to make it an independent foundation,
limited by guarantee.
While there are likely to be arrangements for the Crown Agents to repay
Pounds 2m in outstanding debts to the government, that seems likely to be
the only cash raised.
The privatisation will create a structure similar to the Wellcome
Foundation, the health insurance groups PPP and Bupa, the motoring
organisations the AA and the RAC and the British Standards Institute.
An official at the Overseas Development Administration, to which the Crown
Agents answer, said it would be 'entirely commercial in its approach, and
will be expected to make a return', but profits will be ploughed back into
the agency. It will answer to a board of directors, which will be selected
from a cross-section of its users - including foreign aid agencies and
exporters.
'By not exposing it to the pressures of shareholder interests, it will be
able to act more easily in its own interests and in the interests of its
clients in the developing world,' said the official.
For Mr Peter Berry, managing director of the Crown Agents, escape from
bureaucratic government procedures will come as a relief.
'When you need ministerial consent to do anything materially different from
the act that governs us, then there is 'a stop in the mind' against doing
it,' he says. 'It will be very different going back to a board. There will
be no disincentive to be pro-active. Accountability will be closer to home.'
It will also be easier to demonstrate to doubters that it is independent of
government pressure to 'buy British'.
Foreign aid agencies - in particular Japan's national aid agency, which has
recently used the Crown Agents extensively to handle its procurement -
lobbied the government against outright privatisation, arguing that this
would imperil the 'honest broker' status of the organisation.
The Crown Agents, founded in the 1830s to procure supplies for far-flung
colonies and pay the wages and pensions of colonial servants, now works in
130 countries, generating just 27 per cent of its Pounds 37m income last
year from the UK. Its leading clients are the World Bank, the European
Community, the United Nations and Japan's national aid agency. It is at the
heart of organising aid convoys to besieged towns across Bosnia and is
playing a central role training professionals in the fast-opening economies
of east and central Europe.
The agency has seen dramatic development of its role in the recent past,
particularly in eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. It is training
staff in seven Russian procurement agencies across the agriculture, energy,
health and transport sectors as part of a Dollars 600m World Bank
initiative.
As well as aid convoys in Bosnia, its emergency logistics management teams
have supplied medical supplies to Albania, and procured and distributed
emergency pharmaceuticals to Romania. This increasingly multinational spread
of activities played a large part in the decision to hive the agents off to
the private sector.
But the pressure against privatisation was not unanimous. Mr Rajhavan
Srinivasan, head of the World Bank's procurement division in Washington,
said some of the bank's staff would like to see both the Crown Agents and
Germany's GDZ, its main 'competitor', privatised, to make independence
transparent and to boost competition. 'I don't have strong feelings over
their being privatised,' he says. 'I have been dealing with them for 20
years, and I know they are highly professional, and their integrity is
beyond question.' He hopes independence from government will lead to 'a less
bureaucratic and clerical way' of operating.
Mr Berry warns the Crown Agents' new independence - which is unlikely to be
finalised through parliament until the end of next year - will not lead to
radical change. 'It would be very foolish to rush off in untested
directions.'
As an independent foundation, the Crown Agents will no longer be limited to
serving aid agencies and other public bodies, as its present constitution
dictates. Mr Berry says: 'Newly established private corporations in the
developing world, which used to be our clients when they were
government-owned, are coming back to us and asking if we can continue to
supply them. Under our present constitution, we have to say no.'
Forgotten now are the dark days of the 1970s when own-account trading at the
agents led to financial collapse and a government inquiry, and the jolt in
1983 when the Sultan of Brunei severed links, withdrawing investment funds
and savaging income from financial services.
What will be most important for the restructured agency is its reputation
for impartiality in advising on the cheapest and most efficient way of
supplying projects. As Mr Berry says: 'If we couldn't hold our heads up and
prove our independence, we would not be the large procurement agency we are
today.'

FT  26 AUG 93 / Uranium testing at Thorp approved
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE POLLUTION inspectorate yesterday told British Nuclear Fuels that it
could start to test its controversial Thorp nuclear reprocessing plant with
uranium.
Greenpeace, the environmental pressure group, said last night that it would
now ask the courts for leave to apply for a judicial review on the grounds
that testing prejudged a decision about whether to approve the plant.
Ms Bridget Woodman, nuclear campaigner with the group, accused the
government of 'allowing the start button to be pressed' and said that a
letter from the inspectorate to Greenpeace had not answered the group's
concerns.
BNF has been waiting since the start of the year for a licence to start
operation of the Pounds 2.8bn plant, which has taken nearly 10 years to
build. It has argued that by testing the plant now it can save several
months' preparation if Thorp is given authorisation.
The government's second public consultation, which ends in the autumn, is
considering the commercial justification for the plant.
Mr Chris Smith, shadow environment spokesman, said yesterday: 'This
announcement is yet more evidence that the government's period of
consultation is a sham.'

FT  26 AUG 93 / Fixed-rate mortgages gain in popularity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PROPORTION of borrowers taking on fixed-rate mortgages in the first
quarter of the year increased sharply as a result of difficulties faced last
year by homeowners with variable-rate mortgages, it was disclosed yesterday.
The Council of Mortgage Lenders said 46 per cent of first mortgages and 48
per cent of re-mortgages taken out in the first quarter were fixed, compared
with 27 per cent and 35 per cent respectively in the first quarter of 1992.
The council, which represents both building societies and centralised
lenders such as banks, said that the shift would give the government more
scope to use monetary policy to influence the economy without disrupting the
housing market.
However, it warned that building societies could be exposing themselves to
greater risks through fixed-rate lending, and would be less able to maintain
profitability by widening the spread between the rates offered to savers and
borrowers.
Mr Adrian Coles, the council's director-general, said in an article in its
quarterly economic journal that the share of first mortgages fixed for more
than a year rose to 37 per cent in the first quarter, against 20 per cent in
the corresponding period the year before.
He said an increase in the proportion and length of fixed-rate mortgages
would allow the government more scope to raise interest rates to influence
exchange rates without the side effect of restraining consumer spending.
One reason for Britain's exit from the European exchange rate mechanism
nearly a year ago was that the political price of raising interest rates was
thought to be too high because of the effect on most borrowers' mortgage
repayments.
Yet Mr Coles said that building societies could face higher risks from
increased fixed-rate borrowing, even if they have fixed the rate at which
they borrow the money to fund the mortgages by using interest-rate swaps.
One risk is that they will lose some ability to widen the gap between
interest rates paid to savers and charged to borrowers to compensate for
other problems. Most societies took such an opportunity at the end of last
year.
Another risk is the 'pre-payment risk' that has affected mortgage lenders in
the US as borrowers have repaid fixed-rate loans as rates fall. This could
limit societies' ability to cover the cost of fixed-rate mortgage funds.

FT  26 AUG 93 / Friendly society members face levy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LANCASHIRE &amp; YORKSHIRE Assurance, a friendly society, has told 67,000
policyholders that it has imposed a 12 per cent levy on their investments
from August 1 to create a Pounds 10m compensation fund, pending a High Court
hearing.
More than half the policyholders at the troubled society - some 39,000  -
have suffered as a result of a Pounds 4.3m property write off on investments
in its Capital Secure fund. This was advertised as investing only in cash
deposits and gilts. A further 7,000 could be eligible for compensation if
the High Court rules that their policies qualify as tax-exempt.
The society, which continues to pay claims on maturing policies, said in
December that it would stop writing new business until the court ruled on
whether compensation should be paid.
In a letter to policyholders, Mr John Ramsden, chairman, said the court
hearing had been delayed from July to September which meant the society had
to consider steps 'to protect the interests of the members as a whole'.
Mr Bernard White, treasurer, said that because L&amp;Y was a mutual society,
members would be liable to pay the compensation were the High Court to
decide that the society had to pay up.
He said the society's actuaries had estimated that contingent liabilities at
December 31 1992 amounted to Pounds 8.3m and that the society was being
prudent in levying Pounds 10m to allow for further property falls.
This is the first time a friendly society has imposed such a levy, according
to the Registry of Friendly Societies. It means that even those who are
expecting compensation are paying the levy. L&amp;Y said the Pounds 10m would be
returned to members if the High Court ruling did not require it to pay
compensation.
The money has been raised by reducing all unit prices on the society's
benefit funds by 12 per cent.

FT  26 AUG 93 / Building order books weaken
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ORDERS for construction work in the second quarter of this year were 11 per
cent lower than in the first quarter, but 11 per cent higher than in the
second quarter of 1992, the Department of the Environment said yesterday.
The department's figures follow the Federation of Civil Engineering
Contractors' quarterly survey of workload trends, which found a further
slight decline in work and jobs since April, and a renewed weakening of
order books.
At current prices, the total value of new orders in June was Pounds 1.65bn.
New orders in the private housing sector in the second quarter were
unchanged from the first and 9 per cent higher than in the corresponding
period last year.
Public housing and housing association orders in the second quarter were 25
per cent higher than in the previous quarter and 77 per cent higher than in
the same quarter a year earlier.
Infrastructure orders in the latest quarter were 31 per cent lower than in
the previous three months but 1 per cent higher than in the corresponding
period a year earlier.
Public non-housing orders (excluding infrastructure) in the latest quarter
were 40 per cent lower compared with the previous three months and three per
cent lower than in the corresponding quarter a year ago.

FT  26 AUG 93 / Bottomley call for last NHS opt-outs
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FEW remaining hospitals that have not opted out of local health
authority control were yesterday invited to apply to do so within a month.
Mrs Virginia Bottomley, the health secretary, said she expected the next
wave of applications to 'finish the job' of reforming the National Health
Service.
'The complete separation of trusts from health authorities is a long-awaited
goal,' she said, though she added that any hospital could 'of course
continue to be part of the NHS'.
Mrs Bottomley yesterday announced that 145 hospitals and other health units,
such as ambulance services, had applied to become trusts in the fourth wave
of applications.
As a result of the first two waves nearly 300 units are in the hands of
self-governing trusts, accounting for two-thirds of the NHS budget. Another
139 - the third wave - are due to become trusts in April.
Only 44 units have so far not opted out or applied for trust status. Dr
Brian Mawhinney, the health minister, yesterday wrote to the managers of the
44 inviting them to apply for trust status by September 24.
Outlining the benefits she believed were offered by the new system, Mrs
Bottomley said: 'Trust status provides clarity. It means the unit is able to
solve its own problems and have greater autonomy, greater freedom . . .
Above all it means improvements for patients.'
She said there had been a 7 per cent increase in activity in trust hospitals
last year, compared with a 4 per cent increase in directly managed units.
Labour reiterated its pledge to 'stop the commercialisation of the health
service, and the self-governing nature of the trust hospitals and community
facilities'.
Mr David Blunkett, shadow health secretary, said: 'Trusts in themselves are
the same hospitals that existed before, but the difference is that they are
now run by a self-perpetuating group of people who, once they are appointed,
take part in appointing the managers and officers at senior level within the
trusts. It's unaccountable to local people, it's undemocratic.'
The NHS Support Federation said many trusts were expanding private care at
the expense of NHS patients, some closing NHS wards and re-opening them as
private wings.
Mr Bob Abberley, head of health in the public sector union Unison, which
represents half of staff working in the NHS, said: 'The government is
pressing ahead despite the mounting evidence of serious financial and
managerial problems in many trusts.'
Dr Sandy Macara, chairman of the British Medical Association council, said:
'I am very disappointed about the government's determination to press on
with a system which, despite today's show of con-fidence, is clearly not
working.
'Indeed the problem of hospitals running out of money is likely to be even
more serious this winter than last.'

FT  26 AUG 93 / Recovery in sales of new cars continues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
REGISTRATIONS of new cars in the first 20 days of August jumped by 12.1 per
cent to 325,792 from 290,551 in the same period last year.
August is the most hectic period of the year for the retail motor industry
and is a key test of new-car demand. It has accounted for 23 per cent of
total annual new-car sales in each of the past two years.
The 20-day figures released to carmakers yesterday confirm that the recovery
in sales shown in the first 10 days of the month has been sustained and have
led some manufacturers to revise upwards their forecasts for the full month.
Ford, the leader of the UK new-car market, said that it had raised its
forecast for the whole of August from 400-405,000 to 415,000, indicating a
jump of about 11 per cent from sales of 374,000 last August.
During the first 20 days of August the biggest gains in the UK market have
been achieved by Renault and Citroen, the French carmakers, and by Vauxhall,
the UK subsidiary of General Motors of the US.
New-car sales have been higher than a year ago in 13 of the past 16 months,
and registrations in the first seven months of the year rose by 9.1 per cent
to 874,411.
The UK is virtually the only car market in western Europe where sales are
growing, albeit from a depressed level after three years of recession.
The falling demand in continental Europe is already hitting car production
at producers in the UK, in particular Vauxhall, Peugeot and Ford, which have
imposed some short-time working this year.
UK car production in the first seven months was still 6.6 per cent higher
than in the same period a year before thanks to the build-up of output from
Nissan, Toyota and Honda. In July production fell, reversing 18 months of
almost uninterrupted growth.

FT  26 AUG 93 / Therapy for cystic fibrosis on trial
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON, Science Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FIRST UK trial of gene therapy for cystic fibrosis, the country's most
common serious genetic disease, will start today at the Royal Brompton
Hospital, London.
In the four years since the genetic defect responsible for cystic fibrosis
was discovered, scientists have devised two techniques for delivering
correctly functioning copies of the gene to patients' lungs. Lung damage is
the main cause of illness and death from cystic fibrosis.
A US group started clinical tests four months ago using a modified virus to
insert the gene into lung cells. But that trial has been suspended because
the virus seems to inflame patients' lungs.
The Brompton trial uses a different approach, developed by Professor Bob
Williamson's team at St Mary's Hospital Medical School, London, with Dr
David Porteous and colleagues at the Medical Research Council Human Genetics
Unit in Edinburgh.
The new gene is packaged in tiny fat globules called liposomes, which fuse
with the cell membrane. The gene can then work inside the cells to produce
the protein whose absence destroys the lungs of cystic fibrosis patients.
The UK scientists say their technique is 'milder' than the viral approach
and less likely to cause complications. It has successfully corrected CF
symptoms in laboratory mice.
Nine young men are taking part in the first phase of the Brompton trial. One
of them, Mr Darren Keen, 23, from Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire, said
yesterday: 'I'm very pleased to be able to help. I'm sure there are no risks
involved.'
The trial has been approved by the government's gene therapy committee and
the hospital's own ethics committee. Dr Duncan Geddes, clinical director of
respiratory medicine, said: 'This raises absolutely no ethical issues. We're
using a gene to treat a disease and not to modify future generations.'
The scientists expect to have preliminary results from the trial within four
months.

FT  26 AUG 93 / Crash of the bedpan still reverberates at Westminster: Why
political realities may affect moves to reform the NHS hierarchy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRIORITY holiday reading for Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health secretary, and
her senior colleagues this summer will be the report of the National Health
Service Functions and Manpower Review - proof that the document is not as
dull as its unglamorous title suggests.
The review's recommendations are set to stimulate an autumn political
controversy over the extent to which the internal market created by the 1991
NHS reforms should be freed from central control.
In the reformed NHS, hospitals provide services and district health
authorities and fund-holding family doctors purchase them. But this market
activity - now the mechanism that drives the NHS - takes place within a
bureaucratic structure that can be traced back to the 1940s.
Several thousand officials in the Department of Health in Whitehall, the NHS
management executive in Leeds, and regional health authorities and
management executive outposts throughout the country continue to manage and
supervise the service above pur-chaser-provider level.
Many hospital and health authority managers believe much of the higher-level
structure has been rendered redundant by the reforms. The NHS currently
resembles a huge conglomerate in which slimmed-down subsidiaries are
struggling to reform an unwieldy head office.
Mrs Bottomley set up the review to examine management structure and allied
issues. Its report will, however, advance options rather than a single
blueprint - pushing decisions back to ministers.
Mastering bureaucratic and political skills have always been natural
elements of the job for NHS managers. Many were initially hesitant about the
government's NHS reforms, which brought a more commercial edge to management
style. But, after only two years of the new system, there is pressure from
managers for more freedom, with a scaling-down of central and intermediate
management structures.
'Organisations throughout the world are flattening their structures and
setting managers clearer objectives,' says Mr Ray Rowden, director of the
Institute of Health Services Management. 'The British health service cannot
isolate itself from those trends.'
Advocates of a flatter structure reject suggestions that the establishment
of trust hospitals, running their day-to-day affairs, has increased the need
for supervision to ensure public accountability.
'It is possible for too much bureaucracy and a culture of
management-by-circular to get in the way of true accountability,' says Mr
Philip Hunt, director of the National Association of Health Authorities and
Trusts (NAHAT).
'A system in which ministers set policy goals, with the management
executive, health authorities and trusts delivering them against strong
performance targets, could clarify objectives and increase accountability.'
Mr Rowden agrees. 'It is possible to have both greater accountability and
less structure. There is an elaborate regional structure at the moment, but
a lack of clarity about how accountability is supposed to work within it.'
The review team was chaired by Ms Kate Jenkins, a former head of the
Thatcher government's efficiency unit and a member of the NHS policy board.
Her antecedence as one of the originators of the government's Next Steps
programme that established executive agencies, delivering services at
arms-length from government, made it certain that such a solution would be
considered for the NHS.
Most managers doubt whether ministers will be prepared to turn the NHS
management executive, which runs the service on a day-to-day basis on behalf
of Mrs Bottomley, into an executive agency. But they do hope the review will
create a stronger separation between ministers' responsibilities for
deciding policy and priorities, and the management structure in which these
decisions are executed.
Ministers are certain to want to retain an intermediate tier between
Whitehall and the market. They may simply opt for a smaller management
executive and a reduction in the number and size of the 14 English regional
health authorities. On paper, this would not look like radical change - but
the most important issue is the way government allocates powers between the
various levels of the NHS structure.
'We need slimmer central and intermediate structures that support,
facilitate and broker local market activity rather than try to direct it,'
says Mr Hunt.
A comment by Aneurin Bevan, founder of the NHS, that 'when a bedpan is
dropped on a hospital floor, its noise should resound in the Palace of
Westminster' is still much-quoted in the service. Managers pressing for more
devolution use it to illustrate the absurdity of the modern NHS, one of the
world's largest organisations, trying to function as though all decisions
flow from ministers.
Yet health is a highly political subject and, while managers may make most
of the decisions, ministers get the blame when things go wrong, The distant
crash of the bedpan is an alarm signal, and politicians are apprehensive
about dismantling the bureaucratic structure through which the soundwaves
reverberate upwards.

FT  26 AUG 93 / Former minister calls for tax rises
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TORY rightwingers' hopes of forcing the government to abandon the option of
tax increases in the Budget were undermined yesterday by a prominent former
minister.
Mr John Biffen, a former chief secretary to the Treasury, said increases in
direct and indirect taxes would be required to reduce the government's
Pounds 50bn borrowing requirement.
He also urged ministers to spread the pain of tax increases by raising the
higher rate of income tax as well as indirect taxes, which bear more heavily
on middle and lower incomes.
Mr Biffen's comments will encourage Mr Michael Portillo, chief secretary to
the Treasury, who has warned that public-spending restraint may not be
sufficient to reduce the deficit.
However, Mr Biffen suggested the tax issue could become a test of support
for senior Tories. Interviewed on BBC radio, Mr Biffen warned the Treasury
faced a bruising political battle with right-wingers, who would be 'deeply
offended at the prospect of an increase in income tax'.
Rightwingers, meanwhile, kept up pressure for deeper cuts in public
spending. Mrs Teresa Gorman, MP for Billericay, warned: 'If Michael Portillo
goes on with these policies he will be writing a suicide note for the
Conservative party.'

FT  26 AUG 93 / Public services rapped: Citizen's Charter appears to be
bringing little improvement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CITIZEN'S Charter appears to be doing little to raise the standard of
services - more than two years after it was launched by Mr John Major, the
prime minister.
The results of an independent survey by ICM Research into what people think
about the charter show that the performance of two-thirds of leading public
services - both public and private-sector - is perceived to have
deteriorated over the past year.
Seven out of 10 people have heard of the charter, suggesting that the
intensive promotional campaign that has accompanied Mr Major's Big Idea has
been successful.
There is also support for a range of charter-related policies, with large
majorities in favour of the publication of league tables by public services
and the linking of public-sector pay to performance.
Since its launch in July 1991 the government's Citizen's Charter unit has
spent Pounds 3.74m, with yesterday's research costing Pounds 75,000.
Only eight of the 31 services included in the survey are thought to be doing
a better job than a year ago, with some of the strongest performers -
notably supermarkets - not covered by the charter or its multitude of
sector-related spin-offs.
Doctors and GP practices are thought to be performing markedly better than
last year, in what ministers will interpret as a vote of confidence in the
fundholder system. Local refuse collection has also improved significantly,
in what could be claimed as a sign that the policy of allowing the private
sector to compete for this business is paying dividends.
There are contrasting messages for financial institutions, with building
societies thought to be doing a better job than a year ago, while the banks
are perceived to be doing much worse. Alongside banks at the foot of the
table are local roads and British Rail. The performance of the law courts is
also thought to have deteriorated markedly. With motorways, buses and London
Underground also registering negative ratings, people appear to think the
government's drive to improve the transport network is not working.
The survey has a marginally more positive message when polling is restricted
to users of a particular service. On this basis 11 of the 31 services are
said to be doing better than a year ago. Schools fare better when statistics
are based only on the views of service users.
Awareness of the charter is higher among men than women at 77 per cent
against 65 per cent. Only just over half of those at the foot of the social
scale - who arguably are most dependent on public services being of good
quality - have heard of the charter.
NHS hospitals is the service people most want to see improved, although more
than three-quarters of users think they are doing a very or fairly good job.
Service users are also keen to see improvements in council housing, BR,
secondary schools and local roads.
The survey was conducted in March and April, with more than 3,000 adults
being interviewed throughout mainland Britain.

FT  26 AUG 93 / GCSEs confirm decline in science
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE trend away from science subjects, noted in last week's A-level results
which saw the numbers taking physics fall by 9.6 per cent, was confirmed by
yesterday's GCSE results.
Total science entries at GCSE have dropped by 4.15 per cent since 1989.
It is government policy to encourage science. Earlier this week Sir David
Weatherall, president of the British Association for the Advancement of
Science, complained of an 'anti-science' mood in Britain.
However, direct comparisons are difficult because individual science
subjects, such as physics and chemistry, have been replaced under the
national curriculum by 'balanced science'. This has involved big falls in
physics (74.2 per cent), chemistry (71.3 per cent) and biology (70.3 per
cent). Meanwhile, balanced science has almost tripled at 281.4 per cent.
Over the same period, entries to computer science GCSE have fallen by 63.6
per cent, as teachers have attempted to introduce information technology
more widely into other subjects.
Balanced science only counts as one GCSE, in which pupils must devote equal
time to physics, chemistry and biology. Common practice is that only the
ablest pupils do each of the three subjects separately. This is shown by the
23.5 per cent who received an 'A' in physics. In balanced science only 9.2
per cent did this well, a slight fall on last year.
The National Union of Teachers suggested that the shortage of specialist
science teachers, combined with the extra resources needed to teach the
sciences separately, had persuaded schools to make the switch.
There could also be problems reconciling GCSEs with the A-levels that are
meant to follow, and which are still split into separate subjects.
According to Ms Caroline McGrath, of the Association for Science Education,
the national curriculum is working: 'What teachers are trying to do is give
everyone a foundation to cope with life in the 20th century, rather than the
specialist science A-level approach. The old O-levels came out of the need
to assist A-levels, which in turn were designed for university entrants. Now
what they are trying to do is build up from the bottom.'

FT  26 AUG 93 / Roads scheme for Heathrow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RACHEL JOHNSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PLANS TO relieve traffic congestion around London's Heathrow airport and the
south-west section of the M25 motorway were published by the Department of
Transport in a consultation paper yesterday.
Scott Wilson Kirkpatrick, the engineering consultants, have recommended a
road and rail project that could cost up to Pounds 830m. It could eventually
lead to faster Underground and rail links to Heathrow from London's Waterloo
station and relieve pressure on Thames bridges.
It includes a Pounds 580m road which would need a Thames crossing.
The consultants offer a choice of rail routes to complement the Pounds 580m
road proposal - which is to build a new road from the A3 Hook junction in
Hampshire to the A4/A312 near Heathrow to relieve the heavily congested
routes through town centres in this area.
Route 1, which would cost Pounds 250m, would go via the Kingston Loop and
the Windsor line. It would use existing lines but require tunnelling at
Heathrow, a new flyover at Twickenham and a third track on the Windsor line.
There would be interchange facilities with the forthcoming Paddington to
Heathrow Express rail link and with the London Underground Piccadilly Line.
Route 2 would cost Pounds 200m and follow the Kingston Loop and the
Shepperton branch line as far as Kempton Park. It would then go north,
crossing the Windsor line along a new track parallel to the proposed road.
It would need limited tunnelling at Heathrow before connecting directly to
rail and underground lines.

FT  26 AUG 93 / Football clubs accused of exploiting young fans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TOP FOOTBALL clubs are today criticised by the Consumers' Association for
charging high prices for new playing strips sold to youngsters and adult
supporters.
Check It Out] - the Consumers' Association magazine aimed at younger readers
 -says all but three English Premier League teams charge more than Pounds 40
for a junior strip in a commercial exercise which has become an important
money-spinner for the most popular clubs.
Newcastle United (Pounds 46 for junior strip, Pounds 57 for adult) is
understood to have sold more than Pounds 4m of strip in the approach to the
new season. Other clubs, such as Manchester United, may have sold more.
Junior Celtic and Chelsea kits were the most expensive at Pounds 51 and
Pounds 50 respectively.
Ms Sue Harvey, Check It Out] editor, said: 'The clubs are using the loyalty
of their supporters to charge big prices. Young fans feel under pressure to
support their teams - which can put major financial pressure on their
parents.'
Under the Premier League's rules its 22 clubs are required to register any
change of colours before the start of each season. Each club has at least
two strips, with different colourings and designs. Changes of style do not
require prior Premier League clearance.
An official of the Premier League said yesterday that no club had changed
its first strip between last season and this. Some had changed their second
and third strips but 'the vast majority' had altered some aspect of their
strips' styling, making it clear to the young and fashion conscious which
was last season's kit and which is this year's.
Check It Out] singled out clubs which it said resorted to regular strip
changes, such as Manchester United. The club has used three different strips
in the past 12 months according to When Saturday Comes, the supporters'
magazine. The club is perfectly entitled to have done so and has broken no
Premier League rules.

Mr John Over, chief constable of Gwent, urged Mr Howard instead to set up a

focus on the whole criminal justice system.
'It will take a courageous home secretary but, if all that is done, then
perhaps, as we all wish, we can have a well-trained, well-motivated, proud
police service which will stand the tide of criminality,' he said.
Mr Over was speaking at a Police Federation rally in Newport, south Wales,

FT  26 AUG 93 / Beach owner sues over pollution by sewage
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE OWNER of a north Devon beach is seeking damages of Pounds 1m from South
West Water for allegedly dumping raw sewage into the sea.
Mr Mike Saltmarsh, owner of Croyde Bay, says he is losing business because
when the wind blows from the west sewage is deposited on the beach from an
outfall.
Mr John Major, the prime minister, met a delegation of west country MPs
earlier this summer following concern about the high level of charges levied
by South West Water.
In a letter to the MPs he suggested that the way to solve the problem of
higher bills was for the postponement of some expensive schemes to improve
the sewage outfalls to the sea.
South West Water has argued that it has to raise charges because it has
inherited an old sewerage system which needs substantial investment.
Lengthening and modernising the outfall at Croyde Bay is not due to go ahead
until the next century.
Solicitors for Mr Saltmarsh yesterday issued proceedings in the High Court
for his claim for damages and an application for injunctions against the
water company.
Last year Mr Saltmarsh, who has a holiday development business at the beach,
was refused a 'blue flag' environment rating for the beach, specifically
because of the pollution, his solicitors said.
He had been left with 'no alternative' but to claim damages, estimated to
exceed Pounds 1m, against the company.
The move was supported by the Cornwall-based Surfers Against Sewage pressure
group. Mr Chris Hines said: 'At present the sewage is discharged within a
few hundred yards of the beach, from where it drifts back on to the beach.'
South West Water said it had received a letter from Mr Saltmarsh's
solicitors and would respond. A screening plant to stop debris such as
condoms entering bathing waters had recently been installed on the outfall.
The National Rivers Authority said that bathing waters at Croyde had
consistently passed mandatory European Community standards.

FT  26 AUG 93 / Blunkett attacks Brown over economic policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR'S hopes of forging a united front on economic policy were shattered
yesterday by an attack on Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, by Mr
David Blunkett, shadow health secretary.
Mr Blunkett, the leading shadow cabinet supporter of 'radical' socialist
policies, accused Mr Brown of allowing Labour's economic policy to be shaped
by a decade of Conservative government.
The attack was prompted by the launch last week by Mr Brown of Labour's
revised economic policy. In it Mr Brown abandoned the party's 'tax and
spend' manifesto commitments from the 1992 general election and promised to
cut taxes if possible.
Speaking in Sheffield, Mr Blunkett said Labour's job was 'to argue for a new
agenda rather than to accept the existing orthodoxies'. He argued that
spending on public services should be an essential plank of Labour's plans
for economic regeneration and job creation.
'We must shape thinking, and not merely be shaped by the dogma of the last
decade,' he said. 'This entails sensitive policies to increase equality of
treatment and reward, and not merely of opportunity for the individual.'
Mr Blunkett's comments reflect a continuing division in the shadow cabinet
between 'modernisers' such as Mr Brown, who hope to make the party more
acceptable to southern voters, and the more traditional 'radical' wing.
Mr Blunkett described his speech as a contribution to the internal party
debate about the 'nature and type of Labour party which is to emerge in the
next two years'.
His decision to speak out will be seen as part of a campaign by Mr Bryan
Gould - Labour's leading 'radical' - to wrest control of the party from the
modernisers.
Mr Gould has threatened to stand against Mrs Margaret Beckett for the deputy
leadership next year unless Mr Smith changes course. Mr Blunkett acted as
campaign manager for Mr Gould when he stood for the leadership after the
party's general election defeat last year. Mr Gould was heavily defeated,
but has continued to criticise party strategy, particularly on Europe and
the economy.

FT  26 AUG 93 / World Trade News: Saudis review petrochemicals after plant
rift
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES and ROGER MATTHEWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SAUDI ARABIA'S cancellation of an Dollars 800m (Pounds 534m) project to
build a plant at Yanbu on the Red Sea coast, for the production of petrol
additives, has set off a review of the kingdom's entire strategy in
petrochemicals.
This could lead to more involvement by Saudi Aramco, the state oil company,
in the sector, but is also likely to delay private sector interest in
petrochemicals projects for the duration of the review.
The planned joint venture at Yanbu was to build a plant for producing methyl
tertiary butyl ether - an environmentally friendly alternative to lead in
petrol.
The venture, known as Arabian American Chemical Company, was jointly owned
by Mobil, the US oil company, and Arabian Chemical Investments Corporation -
a private Saudi company headed by Mr Luay Nazer, son of the Saudi oil
minister.
When the project was cancelled on August 9, a Saudi official said this was
because of the need to formulate a clear policy for investment by the state
and private sector in the petrochemical industries.
Mobil expressed its disappointment at the cancellation. The company had been
working on plans for the plant, which would have had an 800,000-tonne annual
output, for several years.
The episode marks a rare public rift between a foreign oil company and the
Saudi authorities.
Mobil had made many commitments to the project; the company had begun to
line up markets for the products and to charter tankers for shipment.
The questions over the project were seen in the industry as having arisen
from a possible conflict of interest concerning the Saudi oil minister's son
being at the head of the private company working with Mobil.
However, Saudi officials say the cancellation comes from the need for a
fundamental review of the kingdom's downstream activities in oil.
This follows the merger of Samarec, the kingdom's refining and marketing
arm, with Saudi Aramco, the state-owned oil company, this year.
Saudi Arabia's petrochemicals industry is run by Saudi Basic Industries
Corporation, Sabic, which is mostly state-owned but has some private
shareholdings.
King Fahd, the Saudi ruler, is understood to be looking at rationalising the
downstream oil and chemicals industries with a view to making them more
efficient and to cut costs. Low oil prices over recent years have left the
kingdom strapped for cash.
'They are not flush with cash the way they used to be and all projects will
have to be reviewed carefully,' said one industry analyst.
Saudi Aramco - the kingdom's main oil producer - provides the crude oil
feedstock for running refineries and chemicals plants, often at a fairly
large discount.
Many in the industry have argued for a bigger role for the company in
decisions about downstream investment, although it has no experience of
petrochemicals.
As part of its review, the government could decide to stipulate that either
Aramco or Sabic be a partner in any joint venture project.
At the very least it is likely to require some increased input from Aramco
on future projects - this could involve setting up a panel for approving new
ventures.
Aramco has already set up a new business unit to deal with refinery
operations after the merger with Samarec in June. It could be expanding its
operations to cover petrochemicals in coming months.

FT  26 AUG 93 / World Trade News: Balladur will seek Kohl's help for way out
on Gatt - France's prime minister is under pressure from his farmers and
allies alike over proposals for liberalisation in agricultural trade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR EDOUARD Balladur, the French prime minister, is an amenable sort of man
who prefers conciliation to confrontation, but there is one issue on the
agenda at his meeting in Bonn today with Mr Helmut Kohl, the German
chancellor, which is in danger of being confrontational.
France, like all the other participants, is anxious to conclude the Uruguay
Round of trade liberalisation talks under the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade before the December 15 deadline. But Mr Balladur is under pressure
from France's militant farmers to reject the proposals in the hope of
negotiating a more favourable agreement.
If he did so, Mr Balladur would risk condemning France to international
isolation. He has to persuade his allies to give him some sort of compromise
so that he can placate the farmers and sign the Gatt deal. The talks today
with Mr Kohl will, or so he hopes, be the first step towards such a
solution.
The French farmers are opposed to cuts in the EC export subsidy system
which, they claim, has helped France to become the EC's largest agricultural
exporter with almost a quarter of total EC production.
They are a powerful political lobby in France, particularly on the right, Mr
Balladur's side of the spectrum. They have already secured the support of
the more outspoken members of the Balladur government, notably Mr Philippe
Seguin, leader of the National Assembly.
However the importance of agriculture to the French economy is fast
diminishing. It now accounts for just 2.4 per cent of gross domestic
product. In theory Mr Balladur ought to be able to placate the French by
arguing that any threat to farming in the Gatt reforms will be easily
out-weighed by the benefits to services, such as telecommunications and
banking, which are a far larger part of the economy.
France has already started to try to shift the emphasis of the Gatt debate
by airing its grievances on services issues. It has lobbied for the US to
accept further liberalisation in telecommunications and for the introduction
of unilateral measures against unfair trade practices along the lines of
'Section 301' in US trade legislation.
But the farmers are unlikely to let Mr Balladur off the hook. One of their
most effective weapons is a talent for dramatic demonstrations, such as
their tractor blockade of the EuroDisneyland theme park. The last thing Mr
Balladur needs is a fresh onslaught from the farmers at a time when his
government is already under fire for the sluggish state of the economy and
its failure to halt the rise in unemployment.
For France's allies, the conclusion of the Uruguay Round is of critical
importance. A Gatt deal promises not only to end years of uncertainty on the
world trade scene but to yield significant benefits for all the signatories,
including France.
The other signatories, not least the Germans, have made clear that they will
be furious if France blocks the deal. Mr Klaus Kinkel, the German foreign
minister, recently attacked France for its 'protectionist' approach.
However, after a meeting in Dresden on Tuesday with Mr Alain Juppe, his
French counterpart, he said he was sure the 'few, small problems' could be
resolved.
The French hope that the forum for resolving those problems will be the
special meeting of EC foreign and farm ministers due to be held in Brussels
on September 20.
France called the meeting last month in the hope that it can persuade its
Community partners to re-open the Blair House accord on agriculture struck
last year between the EC and the US.
Mr Balladur plans today to table his proposals for a compromise deal on
agriculture to Mr Kohl, in the hope of winning Germany's support before the
Brussels meeting. French officials are not talking about the details
although it is known that France is particularly concerned about the impact
of the Blair House accord on the EC share of world cereal exports and on
imports of meat and cereal into the EC.
Most observers are cautiously confident that, somehow Mr Balladur will avoid
vetoing the deal.
'There's no way that France wants to risk isolation,' said one. 'In any case
the French have always been great last-minute merchants. They sit and sit
until they have pushed the other side as far as it will go - then they back
down.'
Quentin Peel adds from Bonn: There is sympathy in Bonn towards Mr Balladur's
difficulties with the farm trade chapter in the Gatt negotiations, but few
concrete suggestions on how he might be helped.
'We would certainly try to help the French save face,' one senior official
said yesterday. 'But we really do not see how we can re-open the whole
negotiations with the US.'
Although Mr Kohl has always been the EC leader most prepared to help France
defend its agricultural interests - not least because of his own strong
farming lobby - his patience has clearly worn thin.
One reason is that the Blair House agreement was partly drafted by his own
agricultural adviser, Mr Franz-Josef Feiter, precisely in order to help the
French. Yet even that gesture was not enough for Paris.

FT  26 AUG 93 / World Trade News: Sutherland aims to force pace

<TEXT>
AMONG THE first to discuss the trade-related outcome of today's meeting in
Bonn between Mr Helmut Kohl, Germany's chancellor, and Mr Edouard Balladur,
the French prime minister, will be Mr Peter Sutherland, director-general of
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, writes David Dodwell, World
Trade Editor.
He will meet Mr Kohl next Wednesday, and Mr Balladur a week later, as part
of what Gatt staff are describing as 'an action oriented' strategy intended
to bring the Uruguay Round of trade talks to a successful conclusion by the
end of the year.
Farm trade reform will be a key concern for both the French and German
leaders at today's meeting, with France threatening to veto a Uruguay Round
deal unless changes are agreed to a US-EC accord reached in November last
year. This issue is expected to move from the back-burner to the the front
in Gatt negotiations in the latter part of September, after which rapid
settlement of differences will be essential if the timetable for completion
of the talks is to be met.
Gatt negotiators return to Geneva over the coming weekend, moving straight
into a top-level trade negotiations committee on Tuesday. Here, Mr
Sutherland will lay down detailed plans for the autumn. These include the
week starting September 13 devoted to finalising the text of the agreement
on services trade, and three intensive weeks through to the end of the month
focused on finalising agreements on market access and liberalisation of
trade in services.

ESSO SINGAPORE, part of Exxon Corporation, has announced that it will invest
SDollars 380m (Pounds 157m) to upgrade its oil refining operations in
Singapore.
Foster Wheeler Italiana, based in Milan, has been awarded the contract to
build a 15,000 barrel per day hydroprocessing unit at Esso's 230,000 bpd
Pulau Ayer Chawan refinery. The new unit will upgrade lower value, high
sulphur vacuum gas oil to produce low sulphur diesel oil, naphtha and low
sulphur vacuum gas oil.
Esso said that demand in the Asia Pacific region for high grade products was
outstripping supply. 'Strong economic growth in the Asia-Pacific has boosted
demand for higher grade, cleaner refined products,' said Esso.
Singapore, with a refining capacity of slightly over 1m b/d, is now the
world's third biggest refining centre, after Rotterdam and Houston.
Singapore's refineries supply about 40 per cent of Asia's imports of refined
products.
Several companies have recently announced multi-million dollar projects to
upgrade existing refineries or build new petrochemcial plants in Singapore.
In February, British Petroleum, Caltex and the local Singapore Petroleum
company announced a Dollars 850m (Pounds 570.4m) refinery project in
Singapore.

HICKS, MUSE, a Dallas-based private investment company, yesterday became the
latest foreign concern to sign a strategic alliance with Taiwan's ministry
of economic affairs.
Other companies which have done so include: AT&amp;T, the US telecommunications
giant; Motorola, the communications and electronics company; General Motors,
the vehicle maker; and GE, which makes aero-engines.
These alliances are intended to bring together foreign companies seeking to
cut costs and Taiwanese manufacturers eager to acquire new skills.
At least five more companies, both US and European, are preparing to sign
similar deals with the ministry, according to Mr Paul Hsu, a lawyer involved
in the alliances.
Taiwanese companies 'are good at making components but bad at integrating
them (into products)', he said. However, Taiwan offers high productivity and
rapidly growing local markets.

difficult problem is people.'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GORDON CRAMB and MICHIYO NAKAMOTO

<TEXT>
SOME 175 skilled Japanese workers will from next month make an unfamiliar
journey. Toyota Motor, Japan's industrial flagship, is for the first time
seconding employees to an affiliate because it has no work for them at its
own plants.
Toyota, usually the country's top income earner, is suffering the twin
impact of dull domestic demand and a currency crunch on export margins - the
group warned yesterday it faced an operating loss if the yen stays strong.
The 175 have not lost their jobs, as might happen at Toyota's western
rivals, but the security of working for Japan's most admired automotive
group has been rattled.
Japan has seen a number of previous assumptions upset this summer. The
latest rise in the yen has left the currency up by nearly a sixth against
the dollar since January, throwing exporters' earnings forecasts out of
kilter. A domestic economic upturn glimpsed in the spring has failed to
materialise.
Company executives' decisions are further clouded by official policy
uncertainties. The new government averred when it took office two and a half
weeks ago that it would maintain the basic economic stance of promoting
non-inflationary growth pursued by its Liberal Democratic party predecessor.
But ministers in the seven-party coalition are in apparently increasing
discord on how to proceed.
An autumn public spending package remains uncertain, the cabinet is divided
over whether any income tax cuts should be offset by a VAT increase or by
government borrowing, and some analysts are playing down previous
expectations that the official discount rate will be cut next month from its
already historic low of 2.5 per cent.
Business leaders are urging the government to act. Mr Kosaku Inaba, new
chairman of the 1.5m-member Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said on
Tuesday income taxes and the discount rate should both be cut, even if this
meant creating a deficit which had to be funded through a government bond
issue.
The Bank of Japan, the country's central bank, in its monthly economic
review maintained this week that the economic slowdown appeared to be coming
to an end but acknowledged that clear indications of recovery remained
absent. Fixed investment by manufacturers continued to decline, it noted.
The automotive sector, export-reliant and with sales at home also down some
10 per cent this year, is having to revise earlier, already modest,
expenditure plans. Nissan, the second-largest automotive group, is cutting
capital spending by another Y20bn (Pounds 129m) this year on top of an
original Y30bn reduction. Mazda said this week it was seeking further
economies than envisaged in an adjustment plan unveiled only in June. Mr
Tatsuro Toyoda, president of Toyota, said yesterday there was a limit to the
measures one company could implement in a short time.
Such new investment commitments as are being made in Japan are mostly for
high value-added products: NEC, the electronics group, is spending Y30bn to
make liquid crystal display colour screens in western Japan, the market for
which is growing by 40 per cent a year.
Manufacturers in sectors such as consumer electronics say that when they are
shifting output of more standard lines abroad, the question remains of what
to do with the workers left at home. In a culture which inhibits
redundancies 'the most difficult problem is people,' says Mr Yasuaki Takano,
president of Sanyo Electric.
Many company executives say they have already done what they can to counter
the adverse effects of the high yen, and suggest that it is now the
government's turn.
'We would like to see the Japanese government step up efforts for a stimulus
to the economy. We are disappointed they have been so slow,' says Mr Takeshi
Kondo, head of political and economic research at Itochu, a leading trading
house.
Mr Ichizo Ishitsubo, president of Clarion, the car audio manufacturer, adds:
'Last autumn we took great pains to draw up a restructuring plan and we did
everything we needed to do in the latest half-year.'
The workers that Toyota is transferring will now help produce a popular line
of recreational vehicles for Toyota's smaller Auto Body associate. With no
sight yet of a government programme to jump-start the economy they, like the
rest of Japanese industry, are left wondering what happens down the road.

FT  26 AUG 93 / Talks pressure and finances divide PLO: The turmoil on the
Palestinian side before negotiations resume
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A FINANCIAL crisis in the Palestinian Liberation Organisation combined with
divisions about what, if any, concessions to make to Israel, have left the
Palestinians floundering as they prepare for a further round of talks with
Israel in Washington next week.
Analysts say the turmoil is the result of soul searching about the need,
under increasing Arab and international pressure, to make compromises to
reach a deal with Israel. Negotiations have yielded nothing in 22 months and
conditions in the Israeli-occupied territories have deteriorated.
Mr Yassir Arafat, chairman of the PLO for 25 years, was yesterday confronted
with revolt within the movement over his authoritarian leadership style and
his management of the crisis.
Two members of the 18-strong PLO executive committee have resigned in the
past week and there have been calls for Mr Arafat to stand down.
In Amman yesterday Mr Arafat dismissed any talk of crisis but he is expected
to feel the heat at a meeting of the executive committee in Tunis today.
His critics have concentrated their fire on two related problems: the
financial crisis caused by PLO backing of Iraq in the Gulf war and Mr
Arafat's apparent willingness, without consultation, to make concessions to
Israel.
After the PLO supported Saddam Hussein in 1991, Gulf states suspended
millions of dollars of direct financial aid to the PLO and expelled hundreds
of thousands of Palestinian guest workers who sent 7 per cent of their
salaries to the organisation.
The PLO has cut its annual budget from Dollars 320m (Pounds 215m) to Dollars
140m in the past two years. It has had to close offices and newspapers,
delay salaries and monthly gratuities to more than 39,000 employees and
dependants and suspend funding of universities, hospitals, municipalities
and scholarships in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza strip.
Meanwhile, Palestinian spokeswoman Hanan Ashrawi said yesterday that the
delegation to the Washington talks would be reduced from 25 to 12 because of
the financial crisis.
At a time of mounting criticism the PLO cannot buy political support by
spreading cash around the occupied-territories and risks being outspent by
the Iranian-funded Hamas, which is rapidly developing a network of social
services.
The financial crunch also strengthens the hands of Arab states which will
continue to use the carrot of a resumption of financial support as a means
of forcing the PLO to make more concessions.
These money problems, combined with what opponents say is Mr Arafat's desire
to strike a deal in his lifetime, have pushed the 64-year-old leader towards
compromise.
Critics say his willingness to make concessions is evident in his keen
acceptance of the 'Gaza-Jericho option' - a proposal that provides for the
immediate assumption of Palestinian authority in the Gaza Strip and West
Bank town of Jericho leaving the rest of the West Bank under some form of
interim self-government.
In return Mr Arafat might be willing to make compromises on control over
occupied Arab East Jerusalem during the interim phase - the current sticking
point in peace talks.
Mr Nayef Hawatmeh, leader of the Democratic Front for the Liberation of
Palestine and a long-time critic of Mr Arafat, said the PLO chairman had
agreed to the proposal after being promised Dollars 700m in aid from the US,
Japan and European countries.
Mr Arafat's enthusiasm for the Gaza-Jericho option has drawn the lines of
debate. The proposal is supported by some peace negotiators from the
territories anxious for a deal which will address the conditions of
Palestinians living under occupation. But it is opposed by many PLO
stalwarts.
PLO officials said the resignation last week of Mr Mahmud Darwish was partly
an act of protest against Mr Arafat's willingness to make concessions which
would leave parts of the West Bank under Israeli control. And Mr Shafiq
al-Hoot, who withdrew from the executive committee at the weekend, said Mr
Arafat was going beyond policy 'red lines' for peace talks with Israel.
The pressures on Mr Arafat, one of the greatest survivors in Arab politics,
are coming from all sides. This time many Palestinians believe 'the old man'
will have to give up some of his coveted powers and allow a more democratic
leadership capable of nudging the disparate PLO factions towards acceptance
of the hard realities of making peace with Israel.

FT  26 AUG 93 / Visionary HK businessman: Obituary - Lord Kadoorie
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LORD Kadoorie, one of Hong Kong's greatest businessmen and its first British
peer, died yesterday, aged 94. He leaves behind a family empire worth close
to USDollars 4bn (Pounds 2.6bn), including controlling interests in Hong
Kong's largest power company and one of Asia's leading hotel groups.
Lord Kadoorie was one of the colony's few tycoons to build up equally strong
links with Britain and China. In 1981 he was awarded the title of Baron
Kadoorie of Kowloon in Hong Kong and the City of Westminster, shortly after
awarding Britain its largest ever export order - for China Light and Power's
Castle Peak power station.
Four years later he finalised China's first nuclear power project, in Daya
Bay, near Hong Kong. The deal was signed by Chinese premier Li Peng and it
earned Lord Kadoorie a dinner engagement with Chinese patriarch Deng
Xiaoping, which was to have taken place at the opening of Daya Bay, later
this year.
He argued that Hong Kong should be a neutral point of contact between China
and the west and pursued this goal both as businessman and conservative
politician.
Hong Kong's acting governor, Sir David Ford, described Lord Kadoorie as 'a
businessman of extraordinary vision' and a man with 'unshakeable faith in
Hong Kong's future'.
Lord Kadoorie was chairman of China Light and Power from 1935 through to
1992. His father, Sir Eleazar Kadoorie, had emigrated to the colony from
Baghdad in 1880, and expanded from stockbroking into electricity. His son
rebuilt the business after the Japanese occupation left little more than the
Peninsula Hotel. The family now controls 35 per cent of the HKDollars 68.4bn
(Pounds 5.9bn) capitalised China Light and Power, 61 per cent of Hong Kong &amp;
Shanghai Hotels and interests in companies ranging from textiles to banking.

FT  26 AUG 93 / Babangida expected to give up grip on power today
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LAGOS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GENERAL Ibrahim Babangida, Nigeria's military ruler since 1985, was set to
relinquish power today after bowing to pressure from fellow army officers to
hand over to a non-elected civilian administration.
After plotting for weeks to extend his rule, Gen Babangida is understood to
have abandoned plans to install himself at the head of an 'interim
government'. During tense meetings of the ruling military council this week,
Gen Babangida's service chiefs are said to have threatened open rebellion if
he insisted on clinging to power.
The 52-year-old soldier, veteran of three coups, was told by his officers he
had discredited the armed forces by reneging on a pledge to return Africa's
most populous nation to democracy. His decision to annul the June
presidential poll, they said, was responsible for plunging Nigeria into the
worst political crisis since the 1967-70 Biafran war.
The resolution of the crisis is likely to be an anti-climax. A farewell
military parade in the capital Abuja will see off the troublesome general.
It will be followed by an inauguration ceremony for the interim civilian
administration.
Diplomats believe the new government will be composed largely of members of
the outgoing Transitional Council, a civilian team appointed by Gen
Babangida six months ago which has been singularly ineffective in arresting
Nigeria's economic decline. Chief Ernest Shonekan, chairman of the
Transitional Council, is tipped to become Nigeria's new president.
Gen Babangida, however, is not expected to remain active behind the scenes.
His officers, led by Gen Sani Abacha, the defence minister, are reported to
be too angry to let him stay. 'Babangida will probably spend some time
cooling his heels at his mansion in the Ivory Coast,' a diplomat in Lagos
said. The Babangidas also own property in France and Switzerland.
But the military are not expected to leave the stage entirely. One of the
key questions still to be answered is whether the National Defence and
Security Council, the ruling military body, will dissolve itself with Gen
Babangida's departure or continue in some advisory capacity.
'We still don't know whether we are getting another military government with
a civilian facade, or a truly civilian administration,' Gen Olusegun
Obasanjo, a former president and the only Nigerian military ruler to have
voluntarily left office, said yesterday. 'If Babangida completely leaves the
scene, perhaps the people will learn to live with a non-elected
administration. But it is clearly no substitute for a democratically elected
government.'
Chief Moshood Abiola, winner of the aborted presidential contest, said
yesterday from his self-imposed exile in London that he had not abandoned
his claim to the presidency. 'I will return to Nigeria as soon as it is safe
for me to do so,' he promised. 'I cannot mount a challenge while my life is
in danger.'
Chief Abiola said it would be a 'mortal error' for western governments to
recognise Nigeria's new leaders.

FT  26 AUG 93 / Keidanren chief to head structural reform panel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GORDON CRAMB

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR MORIHIRO Hosokawa, Japan's new prime minister, yesterday appointed Mr
Gaishi Hiraiwa, chairman of the Keidanren, the country's leading business
grouping, to head a panel which will seek ways to restructure the economy.
An emergency meeting of economic ministers last Thursday decided to set up
the advisory committee, which is to report by the end of the year. It is
charged with identifying structural reforms to deal with the yen's recent
surge, which is hurting exporters.
The appointment of Mr Hiraiwa helps cement relations between the seven-party
ruling coalition and the influential Keidanren, which was a traditional ally
of the Liberal Democratic party, ousted this month following a general
election.
The Keidanren has long sought moves to deregulate the economy, which Mr
Hosokawa said last week would be a main thrust of an autumn policy
initiative.
Official data indicate that the domestic economy remains depressed. Figures
for July department store sales yesterday showed a 6.2 per cent fall from
the same month of 1992, their 17th successive monthly decline.
Banks cut their prime rates by 0.2 points to 4.8 per cent in response to a
recent easing of money market rates, but Mr Hosokawa told MPs a further cut
in the official discount rate from the current 2.5 per cent was difficult.
He was responding to questioning by Mr Yohei Kono, new LDP leader. Mr Kono
also extracted a pledge from Mr Hosokawa that the premier's recent
acknowledgement of Japan's wartime aggression did not imply that Asian
countries were entitled to compensation. The opposition leader also attacked
his vagueness on political reform, the government's main aim. The coalition
has not yet been able to settle on which electoral mechanism should replace
the current scandal-tainted system.
Difficulties within the coalition were underlined yesterday when it emerged
it also could not agree on a gubernatorial candidate for Ibaraki prefecture
north-east of Tokyo. Mr Hosokawa's Japan New party and the allied Japan
Renewal party will side with the LDP against a candidate backed by the
Social Democratic party, the largest and most left-wing member of the
coalition.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Chinese Communist Party's top disciplinary commission yesterday formally
banned party officials from trading on the stock market and holding private
business interests.
In a nationwide drive to achieve 'clean government', the commission unveiled
a new code of conduct imposing severe limitations on tens of thousands of
officials.
Warning that corruption was 'still growing and spreading', the commission
said, 'the negative and corruptive manifestations, if not overcome
resolutely, will ruin the party, the people's political power, and the great
cause of socialist modernisation.'
The new rules are set to strike at the heart of the patronage system so
precious to Chinese officialdom, and for that reason are certain to prove
extremely difficult to enforce. The new code of conduct bars officials from:
Engaging in business on their own account or using their influence to assist
relatives and friends profit from their activities.
Trading in securities.
Accepting gifts of money or negotiable securities, or credit cards.
Using public funds to acquire membership of clubs or to participate in any
high-cost recreational activity.
The measures reflect intense concern at senior levels of the Communist party
over the continuing erosion of the party's reputation and authority caused
by corruption fuelled by China's economic boom.
It also coincides with deepening worries in Beijing over a weakening of the
central authorities' control over the regions.
Officials face enormous obstacles in their corruption drive, however, since
the problem reaches high into the ruling party itself. Top officials and
their relatives are among those most deeply engaged in private business.
The anti-corruption communique was issued at the end of a six-day conference
attended by more than 100 senior officials, and addressed by Mr Jiang Zemin,
the Party boss.
'Corruption is a virus that has infected the healthy bodies of our Party and
State,' Mr Jiang told delegates at the weekend.

French defence minister, said yesterday, writes John Ridding from Paris.
Speaking in an interview with Radio France Internationale, Mr Leotard said
the withdrawal of troops from the two countries had been scheduled and was
in line with the United Nations' timetable for ending operations there.
According to Mr Leotard, France would maintain its troop presence in the
former Yugoslavia. But he said that he wanted to see stronger UN command in
the field to increase the safety of the 6,000 troops stationed there. He
said that French troops would continue to be available for other UN
missions.
France has about 1,400 troops in Cambodia. It has been active in seeking a
solution to the civil war there, co-chairing the Paris conference in which
the four conflicting factions signed a peace accord.

FT  26 AUG 93 / Keating agrees to talks over tax increases
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALEXANDER NICOLL, Asia Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Australian government, facing fierce opposition to tax increases
announced last week, yesterday agreed to hold negotiations with smaller
political parties which have threatened to block the budget in the Senate,
the upper house of parliament.
The retreat by Mr Paul Keating, prime minister, increased the likelihood of
a compromise which would prevent his Labor government from resorting to
extreme steps to push through the budget.
The row has caused talk of a possible dissolution of both houses of
parliament and fresh elections only five months after Mr Keating's Labor
government was elected - though the smaller parties in the Senate are
thought to have little to gain by forcing elections.
Mr Keating yesterday met Ms Cheryl Kernot, leader of the Australian
Democrats, who said afterwards that the talks had been constructive. 'I
think they know that they have to talk,' she said.
The government would have little difficulty securing the budget's passage
through the lower house. But in the Senate, 10 senators - Australian
Democrats, Greens and an independent - hold the balance of power. The
Democrat and Green parties threatened to side with the opposition on the
budget.
Mr John Dawkins, federal treasurer, said the government did not object to
hearing the Democrats' views, but that 'it must be understood that there can
be no significant change of the government's overall deficit reduction
strategy.'
He had announced increases in wholesale taxes and on petrol, alcohol and
tobacco in order to battle a widening budget deficit he estimated at
ADollars 16bn (Pounds 7bn) for the financial year which began on July 1.
According to one opinion poll, the budget caused the government's popularity
to drop to its lowest level in Labor's 10 years in power.
Mr Bernie Fraser, Reserve Bank governor, warned that the threats to block
the budget might force a rise in interest rates - a step the government
keenly wants to avoid as it seeks to steer the economy out of a long
recession with 10.7 per cent unemployment.
The senators' opposition to the new taxes has raised constitutional issues
about the role the Senate, which normally passes budgets without question on
the principle that the executive should be allowed to govern.
Mr Dawkins said earlier in the week: 'I think it would be a very sad day for
Australia if we got into the sort of situation that they are in in the US
where the executive government is unable to secure the passage of its
legislation through the parliament.'

FT  26 AUG 93 / Wetlands protection plan attacked by developers: Lawsuit
filed against US administration
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US MINING and development interests have attacked the Clinton
administration's plans to end the divisive debate over protecting US
wetlands, hours after these were announced.
Interest groups, led by the National Association of Home Builders and the
American Mining Congress, filed a suit in Washington late on Tuesday, in an
effort to stop one of the plans' provisions.
The suit challenges the administration's ability to require permits for all
building excavation in wetlands areas, which would be a toughening of
previous policy.
The suit alleges that the nine federal agencies which developed the plan
acted illegally by adopting the new rule administratively, rather than
submit it to Congress.
'This is going to cause a lot more people to have to get permits in a system
that is already overburdened,' said Ms Cynthia Adcock of the home builders'
association.
Developers, agricultural interests and environmentalists gave mixed
reactions to the plan, which offers some concessions to all parties but
satisfies none completely.
Developers are to be allowed to operate 'mitigation banking', whereby
property owners may buy the right to drain a wetland by contributing to a
fund set up to restore such land elsewhere. Also, a new rule would allow
property owners denied building permits the right to appeal without going to
court.
Environmentalists are pleased with a provision that would prevent
indiscriminate development of more than 1.5m acres of wetlands in Alaska,
and with the president's commitment to no net loss of wetlands in the short
run and to restoration in the long run.
Many are angry, however that the agriculture department would be responsible
for identifying wetland areas and that the plan does not protect more than
53m acres of wetlands drained prior to 1985.
'We believe that the package, on balance, is a net loss for America's
wetlands,' said Mr Michael Crook of the National Wildlife Fund. He said
mitigation banking could encourage development of wetlands by making it easy
for property owners to comply with requirements.

FT  26 AUG 93 / Electoral reforms secured in Mexico
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LUHNOW
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MEXICO'S Congress has approved a package of political reforms which the
government hopes will give a more democratic gloss to the country's
authoritarian image.
The changes were passed easily, late on Tuesday, with votes from the ruling
Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) and two opposition parties. Three
opposition parties voted against.
The reforms regulate what the opposition claims is the PRI's unchecked
access to public funds and the news media, and put limits on campaign
financing. Also, for the first time in Mexican history, any offspring of
foreign-born parents will be allowed to become president, as of 1999.
Other important reforms will:
Open the Mexican Senate to opposition representation by allowing a third,
minority-party senator from each state.
Introduce some proportional representation into the way the lower chamber of
Congress is elected.
Set up a federal body to oversee elections.
The proposals are seen as the last chance for President Carlos Salinas, who
has won international praise for his bold economic reforms, to fulfil
promises to modernise Mexico politically.
The PRI, which has governed Mexico for the past 63 years, needed only its
own Congressional majority to pass the proposals, but it negotiated the
support of the conservative National Action Party (PAN) so as to give the
reforms credibility at home and in the US. Some US legislators are demanding
a more democratic Mexico before they ratify the North American Free Trade
Agreement.
The PRI won over the PAN by allowing a minority-party senator from every
state and allowing presidential candidates with foreign-born parents, an old
PAN demand.
However, the moves failed to win the approval of the nation's most powerful
opposition force, the leftist Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD).
In 1988, a leftist alliance, which later formed the PRD, lost to Mr Salinas
a hotly contested presidential election marred by charges of fraud by the
PRI. During the next few days, the PRI and the PRD will meet in a last
attempt to gain PRD support, although this is seen as unlikely.
'The changes are unacceptable,' says Mr Porfirio Munoz Ledo, head of the
PRD. 'They show the PRI is not prepared to think about losing elections.'
Many opposition members maintain the PRI will use these latest reforms to
increase its grip on power.
'The change in electing deputies will increase the PRI's over-representation
via a more proportional system of representation,' says Juan Molinar, an
electoral expert with the Colegio de Mexico. 'Although the reforms sounds
good, it means the PRI can get 40-something per cent of the vote and end up
with 60-something per cent of the seats.'

FT  26 AUG 93 / Haitian PM appeals for end to foreign embargo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   KINGSTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HAITI'S new prime minister, Mr Robert Malval, has appealed for an early end
to the international economic embargo which has squeezed the Caribbean
nation. He made the request after Haitian legislators, with apparent
reluctance, had confirmed his nomination to the post.
This has completed another stage in a 10-stage sequence for the eventual
return to office of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, who was overthrown and
exiled by the army almost two years ago.
Under an agreement secured via the United Nations, and which has led to the
resignation of Gen Raul Cedras, the army leader, Father Aristide is to
return to Haiti on October 30, after Mr Malval's government has been
installed and the sanctions lifted.
The Haitian chamber of deputies voted on Monday to ratify Mr Malval, a
50-year-old publisher, who is Fr Aristide's choice for premier.
The new prime minister is facing opposition over the composition of his
cabinet. This will have to be approved by parliament before the sanctions
can be lifted. However, legislators want, on Mr Malval's list of prospective
ministers, members of Haiti's conservative parties, which hold the majority
in parliament.
The country of 7m people has fuel for only a few days because of the
embargo. This could lead legislators to approve Mr Malval's cabinet so as to
have the sanctions lifted.

<TEXT>
MS Kim Campbell, Canadian prime minister, is likely to call soon for an
October general election, Reuter reports from Ottawa.
With 1.6m Canadians unemployed, the campaign is expected to focus on who can
best put people back to work and curb public debt, without cutting costly
welfare services or raising taxes.
Ms Campbell, who succeeded Mr Brian Mulroney as Conservative leader and
became Canada's first woman prime minister two months ago, is expected to
announce the election in the next week or two. It will probably be held on
October 18 or 25.
Ms Campbell, a 46-year-old lawyer, has criss-crossed Canada in recent weeks,
meeting voters, to try to distance herself from Mr Mulroney, who was very
unpopular when he stepped down in June.
She will explain her economic policy to Toronto businessmen tomorrow.
Opposition leaders have accused her of party political campaigning on
taxpayers' money and want her to call the election as soon as possible so
that all parties may enjoy free media time.
Under Canada's British-style parliamentary system, Ms Campbell automatically
became prime minister on winning the party leadership in June, but her
party's mandate to govern is to run out this autumn. Opinion polls show Ms
Campbell to be far more popular than Mr Jean Chretien, the Liberal party
leader.

FT  26 AUG 93 / Economic signals flash red and green: The conflicting
figures in an attempt to see what they add up to
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US economy is disconcertingly Janus-faced.
The signals from Wall Street could hardly be more encouraging. A strong
stockmarket rally has swept the Dow Jones industrial average through the
3,600 barrier and into uncharted territory. The yield on the benchmark long
bond, meanwhile, has dropped sharply to only just above 6 per cent, far
lower than most analysts would have thought possible a year ago.
Yet the real economy remains disturbingly sluggish. Yesterday's report of a
3.8 per cent decline in new orders for durable goods between June and July
was typical of recent economic indicators, which have invariably been weaker
than analysts expected.
The biggest shock was inflicted by last week's trade figures for June, which
showed a deficit of Dollars 12.1bn. This was about 40 per cent larger than
expected and constituted the biggest shortfall since 1987, when the Reagan
economic boom was still under way.
In the light of these figures, most forecasters now expect economic growth
in the second quarter to be revised down from an annual rate of 1.6 per cent
to 1 per cent, or possibly even lower. The expected recovery of growth after
the disappointing first quarter, when gross domestic product edged forward
at an annual rate of 0.7 per cent, thus failed to materialise. The robust 4
per cent growth of the last six months of the Bush administration has become
a distant memory.
There are conflicting views about the immediate economic outlook. 'The
economy is going to continue to disappoint,' says Mr Allen Sinai, a managing
director at Lehman Brothers, the securities group.
'It is hard to achieve growth when defence is being cut drastically, when
state and federal government are holding down spending, when companies are
down-sizing, and when the rest of the world is extremely weak.' Mr Sinai
predicts a continuation of the sluggish economic recovery of the past two
years, with growth likely to average about 2 per cent, far below the rate
normal in a US recovery.
But other forecasters are far more optimistic. Mr Paul Mastroddi, senior
economist at J P Morgan, the New York bank, continues to predict growth at
an annual rate of nearly 4 per cent in the second half of this year. He does
not expect the tax increases mandated in President Bill Clinton's budget to
have much effect on future growth on the grounds that the main measures have
been known since late last year. The high-income individuals most affected
by the budget have already had plenty of time to adjust.
He regards the economy's recent performance as much more encouraging than
the headline figures might suggest. At 6.8 per cent, the jobless rate is
nearly a percentage point lower than at this time last year.
Real gross domestic product is 2 1/2 per cent higher. Business equipment
investment is soaring. Corporate profits continue to register double-digit
increases. Inventories are very lean, suggesting that companies will have to
step up production to meet higher consumer demand in the current quarter.
And although a higher trade deficit arithmetically subtracts from growth,
the surge in imports last month provides further confirmation of relatively
strong domestic demand. The rising external deficit is a sign that the US is
growing faster than other countries, not evidence of weak competitiveness in
traded goods sectors.
Looking forward, the domestic economic fundamentals are mostly highly
encouraging. The inflation scare that worried the Federal Reserve earlier
this year seems over: in the past three months consumer prices have risen at
an annual rate of less than 1 per cent. Although few analysts expect prices
to remain this subdued, the underlying rate of inflation has probably
stabilised at 3 per cent, or conceivably a little less.
The decline in inflation, coupled with the passage of President Clinton's
mildly deflationary budget, has prompted sharp declines in interest rates of
all maturities. As Mr William Griggs and Mr Leonard Santow, Wall Street bond
market commentators, stressed in a recent circular, this is doing wonders
for the health of sectors strained during the late 1980s.
Banks have increased their capital ratios and should feel more comfortable
about lending. Companies and households have refinanced debt on much better
terms and should be more willing to spend. The federal government is able to
finance its considerable debt more cheaply.
Equally important, lower long-term interest rates lead to arithmetically
higher share prices because they raise the present value of future corporate
earnings. Higher share prices in turn raise the wealth - and hence spending
power - of both the personal and corporate sector.
There is no question that recent economic figures have been disappointing.
But, since exports are still only about 12 per cent of gross domestic
product, the US remains relatively well insulated from adverse international
economic trends.
Given the strong impetus from lower interest rates, it would be surprising
if economic growth does not accelerate later this year.

FT  26 AUG 93 / US durable goods orders fall sharply
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NEW orders for US durable goods fell by 3.8 per cent last month, a steeper
decline than expected on Wall Street, and a sign that the outlook for US
manufacturing remains mixed, the Commerce Department reported yesterday.
However a separate report showed a 5.4 per cent rise in sales of existing
homes last month, evidence that the lowest mortgage rates in two decades are
stimulating the housing market.
The drop in factory orders mainly reflected a plunge in orders for aircraft
and other transport equipment, a notoriously volatile sector. Excluding
transport, orders were up 1.3 per cent.
Orders have followed an erratic path this year, rising steeply in June after
declines in the previous three months. Overall orders are up nearly 8 per
cent on July last year.
Mr Ron Brown, commerce secretary, thought the figures disappointing but
claimed that improving fundamentals, including low interest rates and
inflation, would drive the economy ahead.
The orders figures were the latest in a series of discouraging economic
statistics. Last week's report of a big increase in the trade deficit to
Dollars 12.1bn in June, against expectations of about Dollars 8.5bn, led
most forecasters to lower estimates of growth in the second quarter to 1 per
cent or less.
This would be the second quarter of sluggish growth after rapid economic
expansion at the end of last year.
Many forecasters expect only mild improvement in the outlook later this
year. Higher income taxes mandated in the budget, relatively weak consumer
and business confidence, and recessionary conditions in overseas markets are
seen as restraining growth.
However, higher share prices and sharp falls in long-term interest rates are
expected to provide an offsetting boost.

<TEXT>
CARDINAL Miguel Obando y Bravo of Managua arrives at the northern Nicaraguan
town of Quilal yesterday in what appears to be a successful bid to end the
hostage crisis, AP reports.
Late last night the cardinal had helped to secure the release of the last
five hostages held by right-wing Contra rebels.
In the capital Managua, a rival gang of leftist gunmen said they were also
releasing the final five hostages they have been holding, including Vice
President Virgilio Godoy.
The Contras had released 11 other captives earlier in the day as the dual
hostage crisis moved sporadically toward resolution.
The releases came after the former Sandinista gunmen holding hostages in
Managua had freed three conservative politicians late on Tuesday. The Contra
group had been demanding that army chief Humberto Ortega, brother of former
Nicaraguan president Daniel Ortega and a member of the former ruling
Sandinista party, and other top Sandinistas resign from the government.

Contra rebels, however, continued to hold five hostages and said they had

The releases came after former Sandinista gunmen holding hostages in Managua

He resigned last month after he was criticised for overspending on its

<TEXT>
MR Edouard Balladur, the French prime minister, yesterday announced a series
of tax initiatives to increase consumer demand and help revive France's
recession-hit economy.
Outlining what he described as a 'new stage' in the action of his
government, Mr Balladur said that income taxes would be cut by about FFr17bn
(Pounds 1.9bn) following a reform of the fiscal system in the budget for
1994. Tax breaks would also be introduced to encourage consumption and
housing expenditure, he said.
But despite these fiscal measures, Mr Balladur said he remained committed to
the government's objectives of financial discipline and non-inflationary
growth.
He said that the target for the budget deficit remained at FFr317bn this
year and FFr300bn in 1994, and that this would be achieved by limiting the
increase in state expenditure to just over 1 per cent next year.
The tax measure will be combined with a five-year plan to reduce
unemployment. The plan, which includes the transfer of social security
payments for the lowest-paid workers from companies to the state, will be
discussed with trade unions next month and submitted to parliament in
October.
Economists said that the various measures would have little impact on growth
and unemployment in the short term, and that the French economy needed lower
borrowing costs to help stimulate the economy. Gross domestic product is
forecast by most economist to contract by about 1.5 per cent this year and
unemployment is expected to rise to about 12.5 per cent by the end of
December.
The income tax cuts, which will be achieved through a reform of France's
complex system of tax bands, is expected to be of particular benefit to
average wage earners.
Other tax measures include tax exemptions for capital gains made on selling
mutual fund assets if the proceeds are used to buy houses. The time required
to withdraw savings from tax-exempt savings funds may also be reduced.

FT  26 AUG 93 / UN aid convoy lifts siege of Mostar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Foreign Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A UN aid convoy broke through to the Moslem quarter of the embattled Bosnian
city of Mostar yesterday, where 55,000 people have been trapped in a
Croat-imposed siege since early June.
The 27-truck convoy pulled into the Croat-held central sector of Mostar in
the early evening, a UN official said. Food and medical supplies were
unloaded from some of the vehicles; 19 trucks then drove to the city's
Moslem east side.
Croat protesters had earlier blocked the convoy for hours. The Croat forces,
who have recently suffered a series of military defeats by the Moslem-led
Bosnian army in central Bosnia, had demanded that aid convoys be stepped up
to besieged Croat populations in the region.
The convoy had been plagued by delays since crossing into Bosnia this week
after the rebel Bosnian Croat command (HVO) authorised passage to Mostar's
Moslems in the face of a rising international outcry over starvation fears
there.
Late on Tuesday night US aircraft dropped food rations to ease conditions in
the Moslem quarter, sprinkling more than 13,000 food packets over the area.
A further drop was made last night.
Meanwhile, amid signs that the continued tension on the ground could
undermine the latest peace proposals, the Dutch and German foreign ministers
voiced doubts about the plan for the ethnic partition of Bosnia.
The warnings came after Lord Owen and Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg, the
international mediators, held separate meetings with Mr Pieter Kooijmans,
the Dutch foreign minister, and Mr Klaus Kinkel, his German counterpart.
After 90 minutes of talks, the Dutch foreign minister indicated that the
Netherlands remained concerned about the feasibility of implementing the
peace plan, and the practicality of putting Mostar under EC control.
It is worried that the Moslems may be coming under too much pressure to
accept the plan, threatening its ultimate effectiveness in practice.
Mr Kinkel echoed the concern, indicating that he was not completely
satisfied with the latest proposals to divide Bosnia-Hercegovina into three
ethnic-based regions.
The European Community is expected to delay any formal decision on whether
to accept the peace plan's proposal that it take over administration of
Mostar until all three parties to the Bosnian conflict make up their minds
on the plan.
Beyond the task of choosing an administrator, EC diplomats emphasise
questions such as the number of support personnel required, how Mostar would
be policed, and where funding would come from to replenish the EC's
exhausted aid budget.
The Community appears concerned to avoid establishing a link between
accepting administration of Mostar and committing extra troops to Bosnia.

FT  26 AUG 93 / Former British charity worker admitts smuggling ammunition
to besieged Moslem forces
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A former British charity worker in Bosnia has admitted smuggling ammunition
to besieged Moslem forces, it was reported yesterday.
He and another aid worker had earlier been reported missing and were now
under house arrest by Moslem fighters in the town of Travnik, BBC television
said.
The pair were sacked by the British children's aid organisation Feed the
Children in June after the group said they had become emotionally involved
in the conflict and endangered the neutral status of the charity.

FT  26 AUG 93 / Brussels warns on airport monopolies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Commission's competition commissioner yesterday threatened to
use controversial legal powers to break open monopolies in airport
ground-handling services.
Mr Karel Van Miert said a special directive aimed at deregulating services
such as passenger check-in, baggage handling and refuelling would be the
'best general solution' to the problem of monopolies at some EC airports.
He is considering the use of Article 90 of the EC treaty, which allows the
Commission to impose liberalisation on intransigent member states.
Seven EC airlines have complained to the Commission about alleged abuse of
ground-handling monopolies at Milan, Frankfurt and across Spain. KLM, the
Dutch carrier spearheading the complaint, claims that charges for services
at these airports are between 30 per cent and 50 per cent higher than at
airports offering a choice of services.
Mr Van Miert said yesterday that the Commission had also received formal
complaints from airlines and private ground-handling companies concerning
other German and Portuguese airports. Informal complaints have also been
lodged against airports which he would not name.
The commissioner said all the formal complaints would be investigated. But
he added that competition officials were already working on a draft
directive, which could be imposed on EC governments using Article 90, or
passed under the usual procedure, which requires member states' approval.
Mr Van Miert's predecessor, Sir Leon Brittan, frequently threatened to use
Article 90 directives to break open energy, postal and telecoms monopolies.
This is the first time that Mr Van Miert has openly backed the use of
Article 90 in a specific sector.
But he stressed that fellow commissioners, member states, the European
Parliament and all the interested parties would have to be consulted.
Some monopoly airports claim safety will be compromised if too many rival
companies are allowed to compete.
As transport commissioner until January, Mr Van Miert pushed through the
latest package of airline liberalisation. He said that a situation where
competition in ground-handling services was restricted would become 'more
and more intolerable' as the rest of the civil aviation sector was
liberalised.
Prospects for a voluntary cut in EC-wide steel capacity have improved over
the last month, Mr Van Miert indicated yesterday. But he said the Italian
and Spanish industries had not yet met strict demands for cuts in state aid
or capacity.
Mr Van Miert said there had been some progress in recent discussions with
Italian officials, and with the new Spanish industry minister. Rome
submitted outline plans for the future of Ilva, the state-owned producer,
last week and has promised to supply more details next month.
Community industry ministers will meet on September 21 for a discussion on
the steel industry, which has been hit by over-capacity, recession and
competition from cheap non-EC imports. In principle, producers must submit
plans for voluntary cuts by the end of next month, but private steelmakers
will be reluctant to reduce capacity if their publicly-owned rivals are
still receiving heavy subsidies.

</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Italian government is considering accelerating work on the country's
ambitious new high-speed train project to stimulate the faltering economy
and create up to 50,000 new jobs.
The proposal to begin construction by the end of this year was raised at a
meeting in Rome yesterday between Mr Raffaele Costa, the transport minister,
and representatives of the principal companies involved in the L28,000bn
(Pounds 11.7bn) plan to link Italy's main cities with new super-fast trains.
The proposals come just before today's planned meeting between Mr Carlo
Azeglio Ciampi, the prime minister, and senior ministers to consider the
increasingly gloomy economic outlook when most factories re-open after the
summer holiday break next week. The economy has been hit by a steep fall in
output and demand this year because of the recession.
Contrary to expectations, higher exports thanks to the lower lira have
failed to offset the impact of the domestic slowdown. Some economists expect
Italy's unemployment rate to exceed 12 per cent by December, as more
companies, particularly in manufacturing, cut their workforces.
Italy now has almost 3m people either out of work or on
government-subsidised redundancy schemes.
Unemployment levels range from almost 8 per cent in the north and centre of
Italy to more than 21 per cent in the economically-depressed south.
In the first half of this year, the number of idle hours spent by
temporarily laid-off workers in special short-term redundancy schemes soared
by 26 per cent. The downturn has triggered increasingly pessimistic
forecasts for unemployment and warnings that rising jobless queues could
affect public order.
This week, Mr Nicola Mancino, the interior minister, warned of rising social
tensions in cities such as Genoa, Naples, Rome, Milan and Reggio Calabria,
where further job losses loomed.
However, the Confindustria employers' association yesterday sought to play
down gloomy forecasts that a further 750,000 jobs are at risk.
According to Mr Stefano Micossi, Confindustria's head of research, the
increase in unemployment for the whole of this year is unlikely to exceed
200,000, the same as in 1992

FT  26 AUG 93 / Belgium defends monetary policy
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BELGIUM'S central bank yesterday leapt to the defence of its strict franc
fort policy after a group of Flemish economists called for monetary policy
to be relaxed.
The 14 economists from the Catholic University of Leuven said that
continuing to tie the Belgian franc to the D-Mark - a policy pursued since
1990 - would damage industry and employment prospects and was no longer an
acceptable option.
But the central bank said yesterday that Belgium was not following its
strict monetary policy for the sake of principle but for 'purely rational
motives, given the (economic) context in Belgium'.
Belgium has stuck to the policy of shadowing the D-Mark, even though recent
changes to the beleaguered European exchange rate mechanism allow currencies
a much wider margin for fluctuation.
In their 'manifesto', published on Tuesday, the economists argue that the
policy is not tailored to the specific Belgian issues of high unemployment
and low inflation. They also call for a freeze on wage indexation and for
structural reforms in employment and social security.
Mr Karel Van Miert, Belgian vice-president of the European Commission, said
yesterday that the economists' manifesto was an indication of the way in
which EC policy could begin to fragment if the drive for economic and
monetary union was not renewed. He refused to comment on the substance of
the text. The bank's statement supporting existing policy helped to support
the Belgian franc yesterday at BFr21.125 to the D-Mark against Tuesday's
close of BFr21.10.

be reduced in an attempt to stimulate depressed consumer spending, Mr

FT  26 AUG 93 / VW may sacrifice Lopez
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Klaus Liesen, chairman of Volkswagen's supervisory board, has for the
first time raised doubts about the group's ability to hold on to its
controversial production director, Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua.
In an interview to be published today, he hinted that the company could be
forced to sacrifice Mr Lopez.
It was legitimate to ask how long a company could put up with a continuous
barrage of unconfirmed suspicions, he told Die Zeit, the weekly newspaper.
Asked if VW was prepared to tolerate a long legal battle with GM and its
German subsidiary, Adam Opel, Mr Liesen said the supervisory board, which
has hiring and firing powers over executive directors, had to retain its
freedom of action.
This, he said, meant 'that within the limits of our authority we apply those
measures which are in the interests of the company'.
Mr Liesen repeated that he stood behind Mr Lopez, under investigation for
alleged industrial espionage and theft of secrets from Adam Opel. Internal
VW investigations contradicted media claims that Opel data had been stored
in VW computers.
He told Die Zeit that the supervisory board's vote of confidence in Mr Lopez
and the former GM employees who came to VW with him was based on their
statements, some in the form of sworn testimony.
'Can anyone expect a company to make personnel decisions damaging to itself
although allegations against it cannot be proved?' he asked.
The loss of the Spanish cost-cutter, who left GM last March, would be a
handicap for VW, particularly in its efforts to restructure production, he
said. Mr Liesen accepted that no manager was irreplaceable, although he
stressed he was not suggesting resignation.
The shift in Mr Liesen's position - he has hitherto been one of Mr Lopez's
stoutest defenders - suggests a reaction to the widespread conviction in the
German business community that Mr Lopez must go if damage to VW's reputation
is to be contained and its prospects of recovery protected.

FT  26 AUG 93 / The Bundesbank and its mimics: France, Denmark and Belgium
are shadowing German monetary policy. Can they keep it up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE exchange rate mechanism has been relaxed and most of the system's
currencies can fluctuate in much wider bands. Now Europe's bankers are
asking the next logical question: should we care any longer what the
Bundesbank does to German interest rates?
In recent years European governments have anxiously awaited each fortnightly
meeting of the Bundesbank's policy-making council. Many of the alterations
in German interest rates announced at the regular Thursday session have been
followed by changes in domestic monetary policy to ensure that a country's
currency did not fall close to its ERM floor against the D-Mark.
But the recent widening of the ERM fluctuation bands allows currencies to
drift over wide margins. And, in theory, ERM member states need no longer
ensure that their short-term interest rates are above Germany's.
The reality is different, however. The Bundesbank's decisions will affect
European monetary policy. The results of today's meeting are keenly awaited
across Europe, with strong expectations that the discount rate will be cut
by at least half a percentage point.
Bundesbank policy matters on a European level because France, Denmark and
Belgium are determined to keep their currencies as close to their former ERM
bands as possible.
The French government is politically committed to a franc fort policy and
might be embarrassed by a clear devaluation of the franc; Belgium and
Denmark fear that a decoupling of monetary policy from Germany would lift
the veil on fundamental economic problems that could be ignored when the
European monetary union project was at its strongest.
None of these countries has repeated the UK government's policy of sharply
cutting interest rates in the weeks after sterling quit the ERM last
September.
France has trimmed its overnight lending rate five times in the last two
weeks but has not cut official interest rates. Earlier this week Denmark cut
the cost of short lending to 10 per cent, a level that may be too high given
its heavy unemployment.
Belgium has been toughest of all, leaving its main official interest rate at
9.5 per cent, and reaffirming yesterday that it will adhere strictly to this
policy.
However, economists do not believe that these countries can maintain strong
currencies through high interest rates for much longer.
'These currencies came under pressure because high interest rates were seen
as incompatible with high unemployment,' said Mr Paul Chertkow, global
currency strategist at UBS in London. 'If their rates are not brought down,
the currencies will come under pressure anyway.'
This is a strongly-held view in currency markets and has led economists to
put forward two main scenarios for European interest rates between now and
the end of the year:
The Bundesbank could cut interest rates more quickly than is currently
expected - allowing other countries to cut rates without an adverse effect
on their currencies.
Yesterday's inflation figure for the German state of North Rhine Westphalia,
at an annualised 4 per cent, was better than expected - and this may
encourage the central bank to ease policy.
The more likely scenario is that the Bundesbank will keep policy tight, amid
fears that money supply growth has shot well beyond its target range of 4.5
per cent to 6.5 per cent.
France, Denmark and Belgium could mimic this policy for a while to keep
their currencies strong. But they would be forced to cut interest rates as
dealers took the view that the policy was unsustainable. Fixed-income
investors, who bought long-dated government bonds of these countries in
anticipation of rate cuts, might threaten to sell them and take profits if
short-term rates are not cut quickly.

FT  26 AUG 93 / UN fails to lift Croat siege of Mostar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Foreign Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNITED NATIONS' attempts to relieve the siege of Mostar remained deadlocked
yesterday after several hundred Croat demonstrators refused to let an aid
convoy of 27 trucks pass into the city, where 55,000 Moslems have been
trapped for two months with little food.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in Geneva yesterday
indicated that the UNHCR might ask the western allies to carry out a second
airdrop of food aid into the city.
The first airdrop, by American aircraft on Tuesday night, sprinkled 13,440
food packets over the Moslem-inhabited eastern side of Mostar.
However, UN officials yesterday stressed that though airdrops had already
delivered over 7,400 tonnes of food in other parts of Bosnia in recent
months, their scope was limited.
Mr Ron Redmond, UNHCR spokesman in Geneva, yesterday said that the UNHCR was
now seeking to persuade Croat forces to disperse the demonstrators, who are
mainly women and children.
'Emotions there are running pretty high. They are demanding the release of
Croat prisoners, the return of bodies, all sort of things,' he said.
The Bosnian Croats, who have recently suffered a series of military defeats
by the Moslem-led Bosnian army in central Bosnia, have also demanded that
aid convoys should be stepped up to the besieged Croat pop-ulations in the
region.
Meanwhile, amid signs that the continued tensions on the ground could
undermine the latest peace proposals, the Dutch and German foreign ministry
yesterday voiced doubts about the plan for the ethnic partition of Bosnia.
The warnings came after Lord Owen and Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg, the
international mediators, held separate meetings with Mr Pieter Kooijmans,
the Dutch foreign minister, and Mr Klaus Kinkel, his German counterpart.
After 90 minutes of talks, the Dutch foreign minister indicated that the
Netherlands remained concerned about the feasibility of implementing the
peace plan, and the practicality of putting Mostar under EC control.
Mr Kinkel echoed the concern, indicating that he was not completely
satisfied with the latest proposals to divide Bosnia-Hercegovina into three
ethnic-based regions.
The European Community is expected to delay any formal decision on whether
to accept the peace plan's proposal that it take over administration of
Mostar until all three parties to the Bosnian conflict make up their minds
on the plan as a whole.
'I don't think the 12 will want to be pinned down until they see what the
(Bosnian) parties do,' one senior EC diplomat said. But there is cautious
support in principle for the idea.
Beyond the task of choosing an administrator, EC diplomats emphasise
questions such as the number of support personnel required, how Mostar would
be policed, where funding would come from to replenish the EC's exhausted
aid budget, and the broader security implications.
The Community appears concerned to avoid establishing a link between
accepting administration of Mostar and committing extra troops to Bosnia.
Bosnia yesterday pleaded in the Hague for the World Court's protection,
accusing Serbia and its ally Montenegro of genocide, rape and torture.

FT  26 AUG 93 / German car output on road to recovery

THE German motor industry is starting to recover from its year-long slump,
despite a 32 per cent fall in output during July, the VDA industry
association said yesterday.
The improvement will be slow, and hampered by increases in German petrol
taxes, but car production could increase next year by as much as 6 per cent,
according to Mr Achim Diekmann, association director.
Domestic deliveries could rise by around 100,000 during 1994 after tumbling
an estimated 800,000 this year to around 3.1m, while foreign demand,
especially in the UK, might increase exports by 200,000 from this year's
expected level of 2.2m.
Ms Erika Emmerich, association president, said the fall in new orders had
stopped earlier this year. A modest increase in demand detected since then
should start showing up in increased deliveries within six months.
However, in the medium term the association expects global demand for cars
to increase by an average of only 2 per cent a year. Its annual report,
published yesterday, said sales in western Europe, the US and Japan would
grow only 1.5 per cent annually for the rest of the century.
Meanwhile, the German industry was pressing ahead with restructuring.
'Sleeves are being rolled up everywhere, costs are being reduced and the
pace of innovation speeded up,' Ms Emmerich said.
Since July 1991 the industry had shed 100,000 jobs and its current workforce
of 687,000 was heading down towards 600,000. Wage costs account for around
70 per cent of the total production cost of a German car.
Vehicle makers and suppliers were determined to reduce costs by between
20-30 per cent in the next two years, she added.
Last month's 32 per cent production slump, exaggerated by the traditional
holiday season shutdowns, brought the cumulative decline in output for the
first seven months of the year to 26 per cent, the association said.
For the full year it expected a 20 per cent drop in production of cars,
trucks and buses to just over 4m, compared with 5.2m in 1992. New car
registrations in Germany for 1993 are likely to fall 21 per cent to 3.1m,
while commercial vehicle registrations will drop almost 8 per cent to
250,000 units.

FT  26 AUG 93 / BAe close to clinching Pounds 250m Taiwanese deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TAIPEI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH AEROSPACE and Taiwanese officials appeared last night on the verge
of saving the proposed Pounds 250m joint venture to build regional aircraft
which is central to BAe's efforts to improve its profitability.
An agreement on a new financial structure for the venture could be signed as
early as today.
The project, called Avro, stalled last month after some Taiwanese banks
lending money became worried about whether or not it would be profitable.
Avro will produce the RJ series of regional jets which currently loses money
for BAe.
Mr John Cahill, BAe's chairman, and a team of four senior executives have
been in Taiwan since Monday trying to reassure Taiwanese bankers and
politicians and negotiate a formula for the deal.
Few details of a new financial structure were available last night although
it will almost certainly not include government guarantees for the loans,
said Mr Yang Shih-Chien, vice-minister of economic affairs, who has been
closely involved in the talks.
The solution could involve spreading risks to Taiwanese banks based abroad.
It is also likely to include measures involving lease finance for aircraft
built by Avro. The cautious approach of Taiwanese banks has been prompted
partly by their unfamiliarity with western leasing techniques.
At least one other problem blocking a final agreement also appears to have
been resolved. Taiwan has backed down from insisting on guarantees that a
new generation of regional aircraft would be developed by Avro.
Instead, a decision to proceed will be taken only after the completion of
market research aimed at assessing the number and timing of potential sales,
the design likely to sell well and economics of establishing production
lines.
Some problems would remain however. Taiwanese bankers and politicians want
stronger guarantees that BAe would transfer some technology, design and
manufacturing skills to Taiwan.
The Ministry of Economic Affairs has made it clear to potential foreign
partners that Taiwan wants to progress beyond the manufacture of high
technology components to their integration into finished products.
Mr PK Chiang, economics minister, has said that resolving the remaining
issues would still 'require some time'.
The original deal to establish the joint venture was signed in January by Mr
Cahill and Mr Denny Ko, the president of Taiwan Aerospace Corporation.
Initial markets for both new and existing aircraft types would be Taiwan's
domestic airlines, with which TAC is 'well connected', said the TAC senior
vice-president. Other potential markets are the fast-growing south-east Asia
and China.

FT  26 AUG 93 / Attack on lethargy of inmates at privatised prison
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RACHEL JOHNSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INMATES at Britain's first privatised prison, run by Group 4, laze about for
much of the day or play table-tennis, while many are thought to take large
quantities of hard drugs, the chief inspector of prisons reports today.
Judge Stephen Tumim praised the staff of Wolds Remand Prison, in east
Yorkshire - the only prison operating exclusively as a remand centre for
adult males in England and Wales - for providing a high-calibre service to
prisoners that costs the taxpayer Pounds 5m a year.
But the judge and his team of 13 attacked the 'lethargy' among the prison's
320 inmates. This was due to the fact that the 171 prison staff - who
address the inmates as Mr - could 'not make the unconvicted work'.
Judge Tumim's critical comments follow the controversy over recently leaked
Home Office documents which suggested that Mr Michael Howard, the home
secretary, thought prisons were not 'austere' enough, and that prisoners
enjoyed 'standards of comfort which many taxpayers would find hard to
understand'.
He contrasts the lethargy of life in the Wolds with the 'excellence' of its
facilities. Cells - to which inmates had keys - were light and spacious;
meals were wholesome and ample; and visits were allowed 365 days a year.
'At the Wolds, inmates lie abed more or less as long as they wish,' he
observed. 'Few of them go to breakfast or use the excellent facilities for
physical and mental education. There is little work and much pottering
about. They play a little pool and table tennis. If the sun is out, they
bask.'
The only way to prevent the lethargy becoming 'corrupting' was to include
sentenced prisoners at the Wolds, according to one of his 102
recommendations. Staff at mixed prisons were better able to encourage
involvement in activities. Mr Derek Lewis, the prison service
director-general, said he would implement this recommendation. But he denied
that an absence of systems for checking the financial aspects of the
contract between Group 4 and the Home Office was a 'serious weakness'. Mr
Lewis said two prison service staff were at the Wolds to ensure taxpayers'
money was well spent.
But Mr Stephen Shaw, the director of the Prison Reform Trust, agreed with
Judge Tumim that the lack of financial monitoring of the remand prison was
'alarming' given the government's determination to press ahead with
privatisation.
For Group 4, Mr Jim Harrower, the managing director of UK operations, said
he was pleased Judge Tumim had recognised the quality of staff. Certain
areas, such as the drugs problem, were being addressed, he said.

FT  26 AUG 93 / Inflation figures boost German rate cut hopes: Shares surge
in Frankfurt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRESH SIGNS that inflation in western Germany could be turning down emerged
yesterday, further fuelling speculation that German interest rates will be
cut today.
Share prices surged in Frankfurt after news that annual inflation in three
of western Germany's largest states had edged lower.
The mood in stock markets was also helped by suggestions that the German
automotive industry is showing signs of recovery, and a new overnight record
on Wall Street, which made further gains late yesterday. Frankfurt's blue
chip DAX index closed more than 20 points higher at 1,917.78.
The state figures indicate that inflation could finally be coming down after
being stuck at around 4.2 per cent to 4.3 per cent for most of this year.
A provisional annualised inflation rate for the whole of western Germany,
based on the state-by-state figures, is expected before the end of the week.
Market analysts suggest that a flattening of price rises could bring the
rate down to 4.1 per cent in August from 4.3 per cent in July.
Inflation has been widely forecast to slide after the summer break, possibly
dipping as low as 3.5 per cent by the end of the year, before rising again
early next year.
Some market analysts said the signs pointed to a cut in the key discount
rate at the Bundesbank's policymaking meeting today. Earlier this week,
economists at Germany's leading 12 banks said they, too, expected a rate
reduction. However, the central bank will also consider the latent
inflationary pressure in the recent excessive growth of money supply.
Money supply figures published last week showed broad money, or M3, climbing
at 7.5 per cent in July on a seasonally adjusted, annualised basis - far
above the 4.5 per cent to 6.5 per cent target range. Mr Hans Tietmeyer,
deputy president and president-elect of the Bundesbank, has made clear that
both money supply and inflation are central to interest rate decisions.
According to yesterday's provisional figures, the annual rate of inflation
was down from 4.1 per cent to 4 per cent in North Rhine-Westphalia; from 4.8
per cent to 4.2 per cent in Hesse, and from 4.2 per cent to 4 per cent in
Bavaria. Prices in the state of Baden-Wurttemberg, however, rose from 4.2
per cent to 4.3 per cent.
Shares rose in Frankfurt after news of the drop in inflation in Bavaria, but
markets were closed by the time the other states had reported less
optimistic figures.
Economists said the degree to which the Bundesbank council members believed
a turning point for inflation had been reached would be one key to its
decision on interest rates.

FT  26 AUG 93 / Better GCSE grades seen to reflect strength of candidates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HIGHER GRADES in GCSE exams reflect rising quality of candidates rather than
lower standards, a government study argues today.
Mr John Patten, the education secretary, who last year ordered a special
check on the exams' standards, attempted to heal his breach with the
teachers' unions by congratulating them.
In the exam results published today, the proportion of candidates passing at
grades A-C - equivalent to a pass at the old GCE O-level - rose from 51.3
per cent to 52.4 per cent. Those achieving the top grade A rose from 12.5
per cent to 12.7 per cent.
The check on GCSEs by the Schools Examination and Assessment Council showed
that standards had not been lowered. A mandatory code of practice for
examining boards has been introduced, and government inspectors appointed in
individual subjects to check that standards are uniform.
Last year, Mr Patten began a series of acrimonious exchanges with the
teachers' unions by suggesting that grades had only improved because
standards had slipped.
Yesterday, in his first public appearance since returning to work after a
six-week stomach illness, he said: 'I congratulate pupils and their teachers
on these GCSE results. They can take particular pride in the fact that this
year's papers have been marked against the much more stringent standards
laid down in the code of practice for the examining boards which I announced
last January.'
However, the proportion failing to reach grade G, the lowest pass, also rose
slightly, from 1.4 to 1.8 per cent. The total number of separate exam
entries was 4.96m, a decline of 4.2 per cent since last year, while the
number of 15-year-olds has only fallen by 3.2 per cent, according to the
Department for Education.
Teachers' unions said the results vindicated the GCSE system, which replaced
O-levels and CSEs in 1988. The new system includes teacher assessment and
written examinations.
Mr Peter Smith, general secretary of the Association of Teachers and
Lecturers, said that GCSE standards were 'holding firm', while Mr David
Hart, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said
the introduction of the code of practice should demonstrate 'even to the
most jaundiced critic' that education standards were 'on the up and up'.
Mrs Ann Taylor, Labour's education spokesman, said that Mr Patten's comments
last year had been a 'tactless blunder' which set the scene for 'a series of
bad judgments throughout the whole of the past year'. She said: 'Pupils,
parents and teachers will remember him belittling the achievement of last
year's successful candidates by alleging that standards had fallen. He still
owes them an apology.'
Educationalists suggested that the debate about standards had been
arbitrary. Mr Dylan Wiliam, lecturer in education at King's College, London,
pointed out that passes at A to C in mathematics stood at 46.6 per cent, but
for English were 57.3 per cent. 'All this means is that we've historically
set an easier threshold for English than for mathematics,' he said.

<TEXT>
WOLTERS Kluwer, the Dutch publisher, yesterday reported a 26.6 per cent rise
in net profit for the first half of 1993 and predicted that full-year net
results would rise by more than 20 per cent.
Net profit totalled Fl 138m (Dollars 72.66m) against Fl 109m a year earlier,
on sales up 8 per cent at Fl 1.25bn.
The company said a series of acquisitions since mid-1992 accounted for over
half of the 25 per cent rise in first-half operating profit to Fl 225m.
Recent acquisitions, plus financing for educational activities in Sweden,
helped push financing costs up to Fl 17m from Fl 10m a year earlier.
Wolters Kluwer's first-half results were slightly above expectations, and
its shares rose by Fl 0.70 to close at a year's high of Fl 99.
In its forecast for 1993, the company said also said net earnings per share
would rise by about 17 per cent this year on a full-diluted basis.
In 1992, net profit rose 20.4 per cent to Fl 257.6m, while net profit per
share increased by 19.9 per cent to Fl 4.15 a share.

EURO Disney, the lossmaking leisure group, yesterday took the unusual step
of issuing a formal statement denying that it was considering plans for the
temporary closure of its troubled theme park during the winter.
Analysts were perplexed by the company's decision to publish the statement,
given that Euro Disney executives last week had verbally denied the
temporary closure rumours.
The statement also did nothing to help Euro Disney's shares, which ended the
day unchanged at FFr56 despite the upward trend in Paris.

FERRUZZI Finanziaria (Ferfin) yesterday fired a warning shot in the run-up
to what is expected to be a decisive week for the troubled Italian group,
Montedison's new management yesterday issued the first official figures on
an alleged L435bn irregularity in its 1992 accounts.
The figures shows that on May 24, Financing and Investments, a
non-consolidated Curacao-based subsidiary, lent Dollars 133.9m and FFr839m
(equalling L435bn) to a Virgin Islands company called Exilar.
On Monday, shareholders at Montedison, Ferfin's main subsidiary, will vote
on whether to extend legal action against former management. Earlier this
month, the group's new executives, imposed by its main creditor banks,
obtained a L500bn temporary sequestration order on assets of six former
managers and the heirs of Mr Raul Gardini, its former chief.
On Tuesday, shareholders in Ferfin will decide on the plans to slash the
nominal value of shares to L5 from L1,000. It is then proposed the shares be
consolidated on the basis of 200 for one to restore the nominal value.

FT  25 AUG 93 / Paris upbeat over Algiers PM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRENCH Foreign Minister Alain Juppe yesterday said Algeria's new Prime
Minister Redha Malek was in favour of rescheduling his country's foreign
debt, and could lead the troubled North African state to crucial economic
reform, Reuter reports from Paris.
Mr Malek 'was prepared to study rescheduling Algeria's debt - something his
dismissed predecessor firmly opposed. This would allow Algeria to win
international credits and modernise its economy,' Mr Juppe said in a radio
interview.
He said France was well disposed towards the new premier, a former foreign
minister and ambassador to Paris, who he described as a modernist determined
to reform the economy and fight Islamic fundamentalism.
'Algeria needs more economic reform and more political dialogue with
democratic forces. We are prepared to help,' Mr Juppe said.
Mr Malek was appointed at the weekend to replace Mr Belaid Abdesselam whose
austerity policies over the past year have been denounced as a failure by
political parties, trade unions and business leaders.
Some experts predict that on present trends Algeria will be unable to
service its estimated Dollars 26bn foreign debt by mid-1994.
Economic reform to create jobs for the fast-growing population is seen as
the key to success against Islamic fundamentalists, who would have won a
parliamentary election in January 1992 if the authorities had not halted the
vote.
Before Mr Belaid's dismissal, Mr Juppe had bluntly urged Algiers to speed up
economic and democratic reform to put an end to a social crisis which he
called very worrying.
He yesterday said in Paris he was determined to help restore stability in
Algeria and would keep firm control over fundamentalists living in France.
'The government has made it quite clear that there would be no complacency
towards religious extremism whose ideas are not ours and are even hostile to
us,' he said.
Paris has banned two magazines published in France by groups supporting
Algeria's clandestine Islamic Salvation Front.

</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A CZECH police chief yesterday denied his country had become 'a breeding
ground for organised crime' and said it faced the same problems as other
European countries in fighting drugs trafficking, the illegal arms trade,
and other crime.
Mr Josef Doucha, deputy director of the Czech central criminal police,
angrily rejected press reports suggesting Prague had become a centre for
international criminal groups after the collapse of communism. There had
been no 'sudden eruption of crime', though the Czech capital's geographical
position put it in the middle of new east-west crime routes, he told CTK,
the Czech news agency.
Drug smuggling had grown because the Balkan drug route from Afghanistan and
Pakistan through Turkey and the Balkans and into western Europe had been
disrupted by war in the former Yugoslavia. As a result the Czech Republic
had become a transit route for drugs.
The illegal arms trade was also worrying. The Czech Republic produced good
weapons and there were large quantities of old Semtex explosive -
manufactured before last year's requirement that it be made easily
detectable - in circulation. But Czech police lacked resources and
experience in fighting organised crime.

FT  25 AUG 93 / Hague court to hear Bosnia genocide claim
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE International Court of Justice in the Hague will consider today Bosnian
accusations that Serbs have been carrying out a campaign of territorial
expansion through 'ethnic cleansing' and genocide.
A similar application by the Bosnians four months ago resulted in a court
order to stop the genocide.
Legal officials in The Hague say a decision on the case is unlikely for
several days, not least because the court will simultaneously be considering
similar accusations from Serbia of genocide carried out by Moslems.
The International Court of Justice, which is made up of 15 permanent judges,
plus a further two nominated by the parties involved, does not have any
powers to enforce its orders, although its decisions have traditionally
carried some diplomatic weight.
However, though few expect the court's ruling to have much effect on the
forces on the ground, the hearing is likely to fuel a wider diplomatic
debate about attempts to bring legal retribution to bear in Bosnia.
Next month the United Nations general assembly is expected to name 11 judges
who will sit on the UN war crimes tribunal on former Yugoslavia.
Meanwhile, in a separate move, the International Red Cross (ICRC) has called
a conference in Geneva on August 30 to discuss the treatment of war victims.
The organisers claim the conference has been called to raise awareness of
the Geneva conventions, with participants expected from more than 100
countries.
But ironically, the ICRC's tradition of neutrality has left it refusing to
co-operate with UN investigators seeking evidence of war crimes.
The ICRC insists that collaborating with a Bosnian war crimes tribunal would
sully its traditional reputation of neutrality - a problem that Mr Christian
Kornevall, head of communications at the ICRC, sums up as a dilemma of
'whether to act or speak'.
In the wake of accusations earlier this year that the ICRC had been slow to
reveal the existence of detention camps in Bosnia, Mr Kornevall admitted
that there was now a growing debate within the ICRC about their policy
towards the media - a development which appears to have contributed to the
decision to call the conference later this month.
With other European governments increasingly reluctant to dwell too much on
the issue - particularly when the west is pressing for adoption of a peace
plan - there are fears at the UN war crimes council, formed seven months ago
to collect information, that attempts to build a case could ultimately be
undermined by a reluctance to submit evidence.
Although the US has already submitted extensive material on war crimes in
Bosnia to the UN, Britain has come under attack for its apparent delays in
providing evidence.
However, the Foreign Office yesterday denied that Britain was reluctant to
co-operate fully and said the delays had been due to its insistence that all
material should be thoroughly verified.
'This is a very complicated process. Apart from the Nuremberg trials, which
were really a very different thing, there has never been a case like this
before,' a spokesman said.

FT  25 AUG 93 / Croats urged to let in aid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Foreign Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GERMANY and France sought yesterday to demonstrate a common approach to the
war in former Yugoslavia, issuing a joint appeal to Mr Franjo Tudjman, the
president of Croatia, to enable emergency relief to get through to Bosnian
Moslems in Mostar, Our Foreign Staff reports.
Foreign ministers Mr Klaus Kinkel of Germany and Mr Alain Juppe of France,
speaking after a day of talks in Dresden, said they would also urge Mr
Tudjman to ensure that Croat forces held back in the Krajina region of
Bosnia.
'At the least, the delivery of humanitarian aid must be facilitated by the
Croat side,' Mr Juppe said.
He said the two countries would approach Mr Tudjman through diplomatic
channels, adding: 'I think a joint demarche by France and Germany could have
influence.' Mr Kinkel said the two countries, whose approaches to former
Yugoslavia have diverged because Paris has troops there while Germany's laws
bar it from sending soldiers, would co-ordinate their policies more closely.
Both countries supported the efforts of the United Nations to find a
negotiated peace in Bosnia and urged the three warring parties to co-operate
with UN officials.
Washington has also continued to raise the tone of its warnings to the
Croats. Last week the State Department said economic sanctions against
Croatia were under consideration, but not military action. This week,
however, US officials have said that a warning of possible air strikes
issued by Nato applied not only to the Serbs but also to other groups
preventing the delivery of humanitarian relief.

FT  25 AUG 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUSINESS in London's derivatives markets fell away even further yesterday,
leaving traders with little indication of the markets' underlying trends,
writes Terry Byland.
A firm opening in the September contract on the FT-SE Index proved a sign
more of hope than conviction, since a further gain in the contract merely
brought out a few sellers. After touching 3,069, the contract dipped to
3,054 before closing the session at 3,056. The closing level put a premium
of 7 points on the contract against the cash market, about one point over
estimated Fair Value. Volume dipped to 5,914 contracts from the 6,709
recorded on Monday.
Overseas investors seemed unwilling to take views on the chances of a cut in
German discount rates when the Bundesbank policy council meets tomorrow.
Dealers said that the locals made most of the running.
Traded options, too, had a quiet day, although volume at 22,382 contracts
improved somewhat on Monday's session. Trading in the FT-SE contract jumped
from 4,449 contracts to 6,773. Barclays, still responding to the appointment
of a chief executive, topped the actives stocks list with 3,414 contracts.
The Euro FT-SE was also relatively busy, with 2,540. Speculative interest in
Lasmo continued, prompted by interest from Continental Europe, and 1,084
contracts were traded.

FT  25 AUG 93 / London Stock Exchange: Early rally falters before the close
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INVESTORS began to focus yesterday on the prospects for an interest rate cut
from the Bundesbank on Thursday morning and the UK stock market tried to
recover some of the ground lost over the past three trading sessions. But,
with views on the chances of a cut in the German discount rate decidedly
mixed, and the institutions still unwilling to chase share prices, early
gains were halved before the close of business.
The FT-SE Index ended the day at 3,049.3 for a net gain of 7.3, having
touched 3,058.4 in early trading. Japanese and US investors continued to buy
the blue chips, albeit selectively. Oil shares, which have underperformed
the market over the past six months, came in for support. But pharmaceutical
stocks, having at first continued to extend their recent recovery, ran into
determined selling from the US in late trading.
The FT-SE Mid 250 Index stuck determinedly to the bull tack on which the
market opened and ended 6.8 up at 3,474.2. Increased interest in the
second-line stocks was reflected in trading volume statistics. Around 64 per
cent of the Seaq volume total of 539.5m shares involved non-Footsie shares.
Declining institutional activity over the past few sessions was disclosed in
Stock Exchange statistics for Monday's session, in which 546.8m shares
traded through the Seaq network were worth only Pounds 1.16bn in retail or
customer business worth; this figure is at the lower end of a daily range of
retail business which has been as high as Pounds 1.9bn. this month.
Although turnover was moderate, there was no shortage of activity by sector
analysts. Some continued to look for further rights issues this year, with
MB Caradon, Tarmac and Cadbury Schweppes among the suggested names. A
favourable re-rating of ICI shares by a leading London investment bank
encouraged sentiment at the close.
There were signs yesterday that market strategists, few of whom raised their
forecasts significantly when the stock market burst through the Footsie
3,000 mark a fortnight ago, were striking a warning note.
The strategy team at NatWest Securities reminded clients that, with the UK
government's November Budget fast approaching, 'the search is on for ways to
increase revenues', and asked whether dividend tax credit might be reviewed.
Noting that last month brought the first reversal of the bull run in
recovery stocks, BZW said that since the next downward move in interest
rates would probably be the last, it would sell high yielding stocks on the
news.
Mr Ian Harnett at Strauss Turnbull, who recently raised his year-end Footsie
forecast to 3,250, commented that rights issues could exceed Pounds 12bn in
1993, which he thought could well take up any spare institutional liquidity.
However, yesterday's rally appeared to confirm that marketmaking firms,
having been badly stung already by a shortage of stock in the market's
leading stocks, are unlikely to allow share prices to fall far before coming
in to pick up stock. The likelihood of rate cuts in Europe and in the UK is
expected to keep the market firm, at least for the near term. But for the
longer term, there are still concerns over inflation and corporate profits.

FT  25 AUG 93 / London Stock Exchange: US buys Vodafone
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Trading in Vodafone shares was at a more sedate level yesterday after the
burst of activity on Monday when Vodafone was one of the heaviest traded
stocks on Wall Street. A block of 9.3m shares traded in London at 553 1/2 p,
coinciding with a trade of 920,000 ADRs on Wall Street at Dollars 84 3/4 .
US investors have been heavy buyers of Vodafone shares in recent months.
Yesterday it was announced that US holdings in Vodafone shares, via ADRs
held by BNY Nominees, now amount to 253.2m shares, or 25.2 per cent of
Vodafone's issued capital, a significant increase on the last revealed US
holding.
Vodafone shares closed 9 higher at 562p, having touched 564p at one point.
Turnover was 2.8m shares.
A generally strong oil and gas area was featured by the continued strong
demand for the exploration and production sub-sector, where Lasmo again took
the honours as the most heavily traded stock.
Turnover in Lasmo yesterday reached 6.8m shares, leading many sector
observers to take the view that a potential stake-builder has been at work
during the past two weeks. During that time turnover in Lasmo has gradually
accelerated, building up to the 14m shares traded last Friday.
The past seven trading sessions have seen just over 50m Lasmo shares change
hands, the equivalent of a 6 per cent-plus stake. After allowing for double
counting that would mean a predator could easily have acquired a near
disclosable stake in Lasmo.
It was significant, said one dealer, that the big rise in turnover in Lasmo
coincided with the first hints that the MMC would recommend British Gas
divest itself of its gas trading business.
One oil sector specialist said yesterday that 'much of the Lasmo stock
bought recently had gone in the same direction', triggering the
stakebuilding stories.
Enterprise Oil, among the FT-SE 100's worst performers this month and badly
affected by the resignation recently of Mr John Walmsley, finance director,
also made excellent progress, closing 8 higher at 436p after being
recommended by Kleinwort Benson and Lehman Brothers. The latter said
Enterprise 'should perform well on the back of an exciting exploration
programme and better than market dividend growth.'
Monument Oil &amp; Gas jumped 2 to 50 1/2 p after well received figures, while
Hardy Oil rose 8 1/2 to 157 1/2 p and Goal 3 to 60p.
A stock shortage was said to have driven BP 7 higher to 305 1/2 p and Shell
9 1/2 to the good at 660 1/2 p.
Standard Chartered was a big casualty in an otherwise firm banks arena, with
the shares troubled by a number of bearish and unfounded stories.
Dealers said the stock had been hit by nothing more than intermittent bouts
of profit-taking - Standard Chartered shares have been among the FT-SE 100's
best performing stocks so far this month. A couple of large blocks of
Standard shares, said to have been on offer around 910p, were also said to
have been overhanging the market and largely dealt with in mid-morning.
Standard shares dropped to a day's low point of 915p but later rallied to
end a net 18 off at 925p. Turnover was a heavier than usual 2.8m.
Barclays Bank, on the other hand, continued to draw strength from last
week's news of the appointment from January next year of Mr Martin Taylor as
the bank's new chief executive. The shares rose 8 more to 505p on 4.7m
traded.
Channel tunnel operator Eurotunnel bounced 9 to 453p, with dealers saying
the shares had been oversold.
There was continued speculation that building products and printing group
MB-Caradon was about to launch a rights issue to fund its acquisition of
RTZ's Pillar subsidiary. The shares shed 2 to 312p. RTZ strengthened 5 to
703p.
Graseby, the electronics company, fell 6 to 179p following news of a
proposed reduction in final dividend.
A buyer of 100,000 shares at 248p drove bid target Logica up 9 to 252p.
In buildings, takeover speculation revived in Spring Ram where the shares
jumped 2 1/2 to 68 1/2 p.
Shares in office equipment company Gestetner improved 7 to 146p, after it
announced the appointment of Mr David Thompson as its new chairman. Rank
Organisation, at whose Xerox subsidiary Mr Thompson was a director, shed 9
to 761p, on the news. International trading group Inchcape, which has a
stake in Gestetner, gained 9 1/2 to 554p.
Speculation that aero-engine maker Rolls-Royce will join the prestigious
FT-SE 100 at the next meeting of the FT-SE steering committee boosted the
stock. The shares finished 4 ahead at 159 1/2 p.
Reports that Taiwan may guarantee loans in a bid to save the Pounds 250m
regional jets joint venture between British Aerospace and Taiwan Aerospace
Corporation led to a recovery in the fortunes of BAe's shares. In trade of
2.3m, the shares firmed 3 to 438p.
A stock overhang depressed Siebe, leaving the shares trailing 12 to 536p.
Engineering group Vickers eased 2 1/2 to 148 1/2 p amid suggestions of
continued weakness in sales at its Rolls-Royce Motor subsidiary.
US buying interest was reported in Unilever, the shares adding 10 to 1070p.
There were buyers for Dalgety, which reports figures next month. The shares
moved 8 ahead to 498p. A broker's recommendation made on Monday, together
with a general feeling that the stock had been left behind, brought a
further improvement in Northern Foods, the shares gaining another 3 to 280p.
Sims Food gained 15 to 109p, following an agency cross at 95p.
Shares in Euro-Disney bounced 25 to 645p, after the company said the theme
park is to remain open this winter. Agency broker James Capel was said to be
positive on Thorn EMI. The shares firmed 4 to 981p.

<TEXT>
Shares in high street retailer WH Smith were under pressure in nervous
trading ahead of today's publication of the group's full year figures.
Investors remain cautious following the group's disappointing interim
figures earlier this year. The 'A' shares eased 11 to 455p, in trade of 1m
shares.
Profits are expected to be in the range Pounds 106m-Pounds 111m (excluding
proceeds from the sale of its stake in Yorkshire TV), with high street sales
expected to show a recovery. However worries about the group's US operations
remain. Cazenove and Nomura were reported to have urged investors to buy the
shares.

FT  25 AUG 93 / London Stock Exchange: Insurers under pressure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES IN two of the UK's leading composite insurance groups, Commercial
Union and Royal Insurance, were roughly handled, with one of the London
market's leading agency broking houses said to have adopted a bearish view,
saying that the companies could be liable for pollution claims arising from
a court decision in New Jersey in the US.
Other insurance specialists professed surprise at the market's reaction to
the story. 'The case is a month old and well known in the US. There are
negatives but there is no need for the companies to change their
provisions.'
It was also pointed out that the US insurance stocks had hardly been
troubled by the news. 'They've been zooming up ever since. It's a bit odd
that the UK stocks have reacted in such a fashion,' said one observer.
Commercial Union shares dropped to 611p early in the session, before
stabilising and settling a net 7 off at 614p after above average turnover of
2.5m. Royal Insurance slipped to 317p but rallied to close a net 8 cheaper
at 318p, with turnover reaching a much higher than usual 5.3m shares.

Mexican equities failed to maintain Monday's record close, which had
resulted from better-than-expected first half gross domestic product
figures. After rising initially to 1,938.40, profit-taking forced the IPC
down to 1,917.19 in very heavy trading of 152.43m shares. In the afternoon
foreign buying helped the IPC to close only 1.6 points down at 1,930.97.

FT  25 AUG 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Bonds help push Dow into
record territory
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
AFTER a hesitant start, a rally in bond prices launched US equity markets
firmly into record territory yesterday, writes Patrick Harverson in New
York.
At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 32.98 at 3,638.96. The
more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 finished 4.54 higher at 459.77,
while the Amex composite ended up 4.69 at 453.20, and the Nasdaq composite
up 4.27 at 735.13. All the indices closed at record highs. Trading volume on
the NYSE was 263m shares.
In the absence of fresh economic news, there was no real direction to
trading, although overnight gains in Tokyo, Frankfurt and London did provide
a bullish backdrop.
Before the start of trading, dealers said that the fact that on Monday share
prices closed down on the day, but still some way above their session lows,
was positive and suggested that there was still pent-up demand in the
market.
This view subsequently appeared to be correct, for there was a steady stream
of buyers in early trading. However, it was not until mid-afternoon, when
bond prices rallied sharply after a successful two-year note auction, that
stocks really took off.
Ford climbed Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 51 3/4 after reporting a 6.8 per cent
rise in sales of US-made cars during the middle of August. General Motors
was also firmer, up Dollars 1 1/2 at Dollars 46 3/4 , although it reported a
modest 0.2 per cent rise in US-made car sales. Chrysler added Dollars 3/4 at
Dollars 42 1/8 on reports that its US-made car sales jumped 45.5 per cent.
Cyclical stocks were in demand, aided by news of a big increase in second
quarterly earnings from John Deere, the big agricultural equipment
manufacturer. John Deere shares soared Dollars 5 1/4 to Dollars 74 in volume
of 1.4m shares, Caterpillar added Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 82 3/8 ,
International Paper firmed Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 68, and General Electric
edged Dollars  7/8 higher to Dollars 98 5/8 .
Selected pharmaceutical stocks went against the market. Schering-Plough
ended down Dollars  5/8 at Dollars 60 7/8 , Pfizer down Dollars  3/4 at
Dollars 62 1/8 , Merck off Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 32 1/4 and Glaxo ADRs
down Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 17 1/4 .
On the Nasdaq market, Roper Industries rose Dollars 5 to Dollars 67 after
declaring a two-for-one stock split and a dividend of 3 cents following good
third quarter earnings.
Canada
TORONTO stocks flirted all day with the August 1987 record close of 4,112.86
but ended a fraction below in active trading. According to preliminary data,
the TSE-300 index gained 20.48 points to close at 4,112.24. Trading volume
rose to 62.077m shares.
Ten of the 14 sub-indices ended higher, with more than 1 per cent gains in
energy, industrial products and golds.
Saskatchewan Oil said its first-half loss narrowed to CDollars 14.2m and the
stock gained 1/4 to 11 1/8 in active trading. Tarragon Oil and Canadian
Natural Resources both reported significantly higher second-quarter and
six-month earnings. Tarragon jumped 1 1/2 to 21 while Canadian Natural
gained 7/8 to 24 1/4.

FT  25 AUG 93 / World Stock Markets: Blue chips lose attraction as Tel Aviv
consolidates - The slowdown in Israeli equities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After a dizzying boom during the past two years, the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange
is settling into a period of cautious consolidation marked by increasing
selectivity in the market.
A domestic economic slowdown, continuing recession in Europe, combined with
expectations of poorer corporate financial results and the continuing
deadlock in Arab-Israeli peace talks have taken their toll of the market,
which nearly doubled in 1992.
Since January, the Mishtanim index, which covers the 100 most traded
companies, has fallen 4 per cent; the broader, general share index has edged
up by 1.5 per cent. The Mishtanim index yesterday added 1.2 per cent to
199.30.
Investors have shied away from blue-chip stocks recently, reflecting
nervousness about their half-yearly financial statements and a general
feeling that the capital gains enjoyed by so many companies in 1992 will not
be repeated this year. Electronic and hi-tech companies, like Scitex, were
especially hit by poorer than anticipated exports to Europe.
However, investors in the Karam - the computerised call market which
excludes the Mishtanim constituents - have done much better this year with a
rise of about 20 per cent since January. Shares in infrastructure companies
have performed especially well as a result of the government's massive
on-going public works programme.
Bankers and market analysts believe that, over the long term, the market
will continue to expand in an economy forecast to grow by 5 per cent
annually over the next five years, with decreasing inflation and interest
rates. Furthermore, any serious progress in the peace process, which holds
out the prospect of Israel becoming the industrial and trading capital of
the Middle East, would cause another massive boom.
The potential long-term strength of the equity market is evident in the rise
in financial assets held by the public from USDollars 88bn in 1988 to
USDollars 130bn today; a quarter of this is invested in stocks, compared
with less than 6 per cent in 1988.
The economy is awash with liquidity; and the population has a high
propensity to save. This has encouraged a corporate rush to raise capital on
the stock market. Since January, more than 140 public and private offerings
of shares and convertible securities have been floated on the TASE; and more
than 100 companies have joined the exchange, increasing its listings to
almost 500. More than Shk3bn (over Dollars 1bn) has been raised this year
and turnover on the TASE averaged Shk194m in the first six months of the
year.
On top of this, the government felt that the market was strong enough to
take the sale of shares in the country's two largest state-owned banks.
Twenty per cent of Bank Hapoalim was sold in June and 20 per cent of Bank
Leumi is up for sale next week, adding to what is expected to be a record
wave of new issues.
Analysts believe that there is more than enough liquidity to soak up the new
issues with an estimated Shk7bn expected to leave the traded and non-traded
bond markets during the rest of this year.
The government, in an effort to reduce its domestic borrowing and cut its
deficit, is issuing less bonds. Provident and pension funds, with a combined
capital of more than Shk120bn, were only recently allowed by the government
to invest up to half their capital in equities.
The thumbnail scenario for the market - predictions of strong economic
growth and lower inflation, combined with government promises of more
privatisation to come of big profitable state-owned corporations like Israel
Chemicals and Bezeq, the telecommunications giant - have created an
optimistic atmosphere among most analysts.
As a mark of its confidence, earlier this month the TASE opened an options
market called the MOAF-25 which trades on an index of the 25 stocks with the
highest capitalisation. The TASE hopes that this will lay the ground for
much more extensive futures and options trading.

of mortgage lending

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SHARE prices fluctuated in a narrow range ahead of September book closing,
and the Nikkei index ended marginally higher on arbitrage buying, writes
Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The 225-issue index fell 17.70 to 20,431.84 after recording the day's low of
20,344.83 in the morning, and peaking at 20,469.85 during the afternoon.
Volume was 170m shares against Monday's 138m shares, the lowest level of the
year. Losers outperformed gainers by 531 to 395 with 211 issues unchanged.
The Topix index of all first section stocks fell 1.87 to 1,642.31 and, in
London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 0.87 to 1,253.60.
Traders said that uncertainty over the yen's strength had cast doubt over an
imminent interest rate cut. Inconsistent comments by ministers over an
income tax cut also discouraged investors. Ms Manae Kubota, head of the
economic planning agency, and Mr Koshiro Ishida, director-general of the
management and coordination agency, voiced the need for a possible reduction
in income taxes, while Mr Hirohisa Fujii, the finance minister, retained his
cautious stance.
Pessimism over the likelihood of an interest rate cut depressed financial
stocks. Bank of Yokohama, the day's most active issue, fell Y20 to Y1,090
and Industrial Bank of Japan also lost Y20 to Y3,340.
Sanyo Electric gained Y23 to Y445 and Kyocera advanced Y150 to Y6,160 on
reports that the government may promote the use of solar power generation
systems.
Profit-taking hit Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, which lost Y3,000 to
Y933,000. Ricoh, the office equipment maker which has been popular among
investors after announcing a technological development, fell Y13 to Y795.
Other high-technology issues were mixed. Nikon rose Y21 to Y921, supported

Roundup
PROFIT-TAKING was much in evidence among the region's markets yesterday as a
number of them began to consolidate recent record levels. Pakistan was
closed for a holiday.

SINGAPORE fell back on profit-taking for the second day in succession with
most of the activity concentrated on second-line stocks. The Straits Times

SEOUL was another market where profit-taking pre-dominated and the composite
index shed 12.03 to 715.03. Turnover was Won298m. TAIWAN closed below the
4,000 level in slow trading and brokers expected the downward consolidation
to continue. The weighted index fell 29.20 at 3,977.37 in turnover of
TDollars 13.6bn.

BOURSES changed tack as talk turned to the Bundesbank meeting tomorrow and
the chances of a German discount rate cut, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT rose 9.42 to 1,897.69, and the Ibis-indicated DAX index put on
another 10 points in the post-bourse to close at 1,907.72. However, brokers
said that the market was in a waiting phase as turnover eased up from
DM5.7bn to a moderate DM6.2bn.
Miss Heidemarie Hoppner at B Metzler in Frankfurt said that participants
were looking ahead to the Bundesbank meeting, and German inflation figures
on Friday.
Meanwhile, Volkswagen fell another DM6 to DM368 on selling orders from
abroad, and the adoption of short positions by domestic professionals. MAN,
the truckmaker and engineer, lost DM2 to DM321.50 for a two-day drop of
DM9.50 on Monday's profits slump and dividend cut.
In retailing, Kaufhof stood out with a gain of DM11 to DM536.50 in
anticipation, said analysts, of good half year results shortly.
PARIS regained ground after a day's low of 2,114 for the CAC-40 index, to
end 12.03 higher at 2,123.40. Turnover rose from FFr2.4bn to FFr3.2bn.
Euro Disney, which fell sharply at the start of the week on negative media
reports, picked up some of the losses on bargain hunting to see a day's high
of FFr57 before closing unchanged at FFr56.
LVMH, which announced that it was to take control of Desfosses
International, the French newspaper group, added FFr32 to FFr4,175.
In banks, BNP CI's were down FFr1 at FFr598. James Capel upgraded the stock
to a long-term buy, noting that the forthcoming privatisation would coincide
with an expected pick-up in the economy in 1994 which should see 'falling
levels of provisions due to lower loan losses and write-downs'. Since the
current rally in BNP began at the end of last month, the CI's have risen by
13.5 per cent.
AMSTERDAM picked up momentum after a negative start to the week, the CBS
Tendency general index adding 0.7 to 127.8 in brisker turnover.
Wolters Kluwer featured after a solid advance in first half profits, the
shares rising 70 cents to Fl 99.00, off the day's high of Fl 100.20.
Elsewhere in the publishing sector, Elsevier eased 10 cents to Fl 143.80.
Considerable activity was also noted ahead of today's results for Gist
Brocades, the food group, which put on Fl 1.80 to Fl 47.60.
ZURICH closed mixed, the SMI index rising 5.1 to 2,472.4. Brown Boveri fell
yet again, this time by SFr12 to SFr884 after its Swiss/Swedish operating
company, ABB Asea Brown Boveri, announced plans for 15 factory closures in
its plans to streamline its structure.
The watchmaker, SMH, added SFr40 to SFr1,165 on Monday's news that it had
opened its first watch store in China, and that the store had been mobbed by
some 5,000 people. Chemicals rose on plans by the Swiss investment company,
Pharma Vision, to increase its capital.
MADRID set another new high, the general index rising 2.74 to 293.84,
pinning its hopes on the Bundesbank and seeming to ignore the Bank of
Spain's decision to leave a key repo rate unchanged.
STOCKHOLM fell back on disappointment with first half results from Svenska
Handelsbanken which fell SKr16 to SKr130. The bank also announced plans to
raise SKr2.7bn from shareholders. The Affarsvarlden general index slipped
21.80 or 1.7 per cent to 1,269.80 while the banking index was off nearly 8
per cent.
Asea B fell SKr8 to SKr471 after Asea Brown Boveri's major reorganisation
announcement.
COPENHAGEN lost nearly 2 per cent on profit-taking, with shipping and bank
shares reported weak as the KFX index fell 1.77 to 97.73.
WARSAW continued its unprecedented ascent as the WIG index soared 9.6 per
cent to a new record of 7,001.1, writes Christopher Bobinski in Warsaw. The
rise came mainly from private domestic investors crowding in to buy the 19
stocks quoted on the WSE as turnover reached 499.9bn zlotys (Dollars 27.5m).
According to Mr Woldzimierz Magiera, deputy head of the exchange, the number
of daily buy and sell orders has reached 25,000, compared with 3,000 a day
two months ago.
At the end of July the number of investors registered with broking offices
had reached 102,000 and is growing by 5,000 a month. Foreign investors hold
some 25 per cent of the value of the stocks on the exchange, which is
capitalised at Dollars 1.5bn.

FT  25 AUG 93 / Money Markets: Unchanged repo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bundesbank yesterday announced that there would be an unchanged fixed
rate repo in this week's securities repurchase tender, keeping German
interest rates on hold, writes James Blitz.
The news on the repo was well anticipated by the market and there was little
change in German interest rate futures. The September Euromark contract
closed unchanged at 93.54 and the December contract was up 1 basis point at
94.03.
Attention is now focused on whether the Bundesbank will cut its discount
rate at its council meeting tomorrow, the first since the crisis in the
exchange rate mechanism.
There were some reasons for thinking that the Bundesbank would lean towards
a cut in the discount rate floor by  1/4 of a percentage point to 6.50 per
cent tomorrow.
The Bundesbank needs to restore a 40 to 50 basis point gap that
traditionally exists between call money and the discount rate floor. Call
money was yesterday at around 6.85 per cent, providing a differential of
only 10 basis points.
But better inflation figures could also make the case for a cut stronger.
The cost of living in the western German state of Baden Wurttemberg rose by
0.1 per cent on the month to mid-August and was at 4.3 per cent on the year.
This was on the low side of economists' expectations.
Moreover, some analysts believe that the Bundesbank could risk driving
European currencies further away from the D-Mark if it does not cut rates
tomorrow while other European countries do.
However, the Bundesbank could be concerned by the huge liquidity that has
flowed into the market as a result of its intervention in support of the
French franc earlier this month. The central bank could wish to signal again
that policy remains tight.
France yesterday continued to suspend its window for overnight lending to
the French money market. However, this was still seen as a technical move
coinciding with the market's high liquidity. Three month money was virtually
unchanged at around 7.40 per cent. The September Pibor contract was down 6
basis points at 93.19.
Sterling markets were little changed with 3 month money closing at roughly
the same level of 5 7/8 per cent. A shortage of Pounds 550m was forecast at
the start of the day and there was late assistance of Pounds 155m.

FT  25 AUG 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Waiting for the Bundesbank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE dollar and D-Mark traded in tight ranges against most currencies
yesterday, with dealers waiting to see what the Bundesbank would do with
official interest rates tomorrow before deciding their next move, writes
James Blitz.
Tomorrow's Bundesbank meeting is the first since the crisis in the exchange
rate mechanism led to widening of its fluctuation bands. A 25 basis point
cut in the discount rate has been priced in by the market, which believes
that the differential between money market rates and the German interest
rate floor is too close.
If the Bundesbank does not ease tomorrow, a short-term appreciation across
the board for the D-Mark could be expected. Yesterday, dealers were hedging
their bets, with the dollar closing at DM1.6815 from a previous DM1.6885.
The French franc closed at FFr3.481 to the D-Mark from a previous FFr3.485.
Sterling, however, suffered a sharper fall, dropping 2 pfennigs on the day
to close at DM2.5175. Dealers were moved by a variety of factors: the pound
broke through the Dollars 1.50 level against the dollar, triggering
stop-losses across the board for risk averse traders. The currency closed at
Dollars 1.4965 against the dollar from a previous Dollars 1.5025.
For the major currencies, medium term factors need to be looked at when
explaining performance. Some analysts believe that fund managers' operations
 -as well as short-term interest rate differentials - may explain why the
dollar is showing weakness against the D-Mark at this time.
At a presentation in London yesterday, Mr Michael R, Rosenberg, director of
fixed income research at Merrill Lynch investment bank, unveiled his latest
survey of portfolio managers' global investments.
This showed that they remain heavily overweight in dollars and underweight
in the D-Mark. 'That may be why the dollar is having difficulty breaking
through current levels against the D-Mark,' he said.
However, he believes that the D-Mark is substantially overvalued against the
dollar and most European currencies and is set for a long-term decline. He
forecasts a rise for the dollar above the DM2.00 level over the next 18-24
months.
Mr Rosenberg believes that investors are so substantially underweight in the
yen that a break through the Y100 level is guaranteed. 'As yet, there has
been no carry through by investors behind the exchange rate move,' he said.
He sticks to the view that the yen will hit '95 in '95.' The yen closed
yesterday at Y103.70 little changed on the day.
Mr Jeremy Hawkins, economic adviser at Bank of America in London, also
believes a break through the Y100 level is likely, but says that investors
have been frightened by the success of recent US intervention in support of
the dollar.

THE NEW Zealand Wool Board says it has sold off half its stockpile of wool,
reports Reuter from Wellington.
In February 1991 the board stopped a price support scheme following the
collapse of a similar system in Australia. It had held a maximum of 655,228
bales in the middle of the 1990-91 season.
The wool has been sold off gradually to spread the impact on the market.

FT  25 AUG 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Metals prices 'still have some
way to fall'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BASE METALS prices still have some way to fall before they stage a cyclical
recovery, according to SG Warburg Securities, the financial services group.
It is cautious because world-wide base metals stocks 'look horrific'. Only
copper stocks are at present substantially lower than they were, compared
with annual consumption, in the depths of the recession in the mid-1980s,
points out Mr Euan Worthington, head of the mining team.
Warburg calculates that western world aluminium stocks are equivalent to
23.7 per cent of annual consumption compared with the peak level of 24.1 per
cent; copper stocks represent 16.9 per cent of annual consumption (23.5 per
cent at the previous peak); lead 15.3 per cent (13.6 per cent); nickel 32.8
per cent (32.3 per cent) and zinc 23.9 per cent (13.8 per cent.)
Mr Worthington suggests stocks will continue to grow because even next year
metal production, together with imports from the Commonwealth of Independent
States, will exceed western world demand.
Aluminium, copper, nickel and zinc prices could show further falls in the
coming six months as market speculators unwind bullish positions, he
suggests in the latest edition of Warburg's International Mining Outlook.
'The copper price looks particularly vulnerable as the squeeze for
September-October delivery is unwound.
'Investors in base metal shares should not be fooled, the current period
still holds the potential for further downside in base metal prices and
consequently pain for their producers.'
Mr Worthington says prices have failed to recover as some expected, partly
because world economic growth has remained out of synchronisation and partly
because of a continuing high level of exports from the CIS and because of
the failure of western metal producers to make adequate output cuts.

The London Metal Exchange three months COPPER price eased from the day's
highs in after hours trading but still showed a gain of about Dollars 20 a
tonne on the day. Traders said talk of possible Japanese output cuts and a
widening spread, which threatened to bring September Dollars 2,000 call
options into the money, triggered widespread short-covering and took the
price up to Dollars 1,948 at one stage. But profit-taking trimmed the rise
and three months last traded at Dollars 1,943 a tonne, with the cash/three
months premium, which had widened to Dollars 42 earlier, closing in to
Dollars 37 a tonne. ALUMINIUM continued to find good two-way business around
the Dollars 1,170 level for three months metal resulting in a narrow trading
range. It closed below that level for the first time since early June,
although with a last trade at Dollars 1,168.50, down Dollars 1.50, traders
did not regard that as a significant breakdown. NICKEL was under pressure
again from hedge selling but continued to find buying on dips below Dollars
4,700 a tonne. Last business was at Dollars 4,705, unchanged on the day.
LEAD drifted despite LME stocks data showing 1,100 tonnes taken out of the
Baltimore warehouse.

FT  25 AUG 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Crop worries push cocoa prices
to 22-month highs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COCOA PRICES climbed to 22-month highs in London yesterday on growing
expectations that world supply will fall short of demand for the third
season in a row.
Reports suggesting a poor 1993-94 crop in Ivory Coast and Ghana, which
produce about 30 per cent and 10 per cent of world output respectively,
underpinned the buying mood.
The December futures contract pushed through resistance at Pounds 800 a
tonne to reach a day's peak of Pounds 819, its highest level since October
1991. It eased slightly to close up Pounds 21 at Pounds 815. The next
resistance point is expected to be around Pounds 832, which would take it to
a level last reached in June 1990.
In New York, the December contract, which had risen by Dollars 24 on Monday,
was quoted at Dollars 1,060 a tonne in late trading, up another Dollars 6.
'People are a bit worried about the crop development, particularly in west
Africa,' said a London analyst. 'It looks very likely that there will be a
deficit, it's just a question of how big. If the crops don't improve, it's
going to be bigger than people expected a couple of months ago.'
Ms Judith Ganes, softs analyst with Merrill Lynch Capital Markets in New
York, said she expected the market to go higher. 'The fundamentals have been
much more clear cut than for coffee in terms of the erosion of stocks and
the potential for a third deficit,' she said.
The International Cocoa Organisation's buffer stock stands at about 230,000
tonnes. On Monday it sold 1,086 tonnes at prices between Dollars 974 and
Dollars 1,080 a tonne.
ED &amp; F. Man, the London broker, has estimated the the current season's
shortfall at 96,000 tonnes, based on production of 2.36m tonnes. Gill and
Duffus, the trade house, has a similar estimate, after a 90,000 tonne
shortfall in 1991-92.
However, GNI, the London trade house, which earlier this month put the
production deficit at about 100,000 tonnes, suggested the shortfall in
supply to world markets was actually about 244,000 because Ivory Coast, the
world's biggest producer, had banned mid-crop exports.
It forecast another big supply deficit next season of some 241,000 tonnes,
and said this continuing scenario, with further reductions in world stocks,
could lead to a repeat of the 1970s bull market.
Robusta coffee prices also had a buoyant day in London yesterday, supported
by a strong performance by arabica futures in New York the previous day. The
Latin American coffee retention scheme, which gained the backing of African
producers last week, continued to underpin sentiment.
The November contract ended up Dollars 22 at Dollars 1,242 a tonne, after
reaching a high of Dollars 1,258.

FT  25 AUG 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Venezuela seeks private capital
to pull aluminium out of the red - Although they are among the lowest-cost
producers the country's smelters are finding profits increasingly elusive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOSEPH MANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE VENEZUELAN government has announced that it will carry out a major
reorganisation of the state-controlled aluminium sector, selling some assets
outright and seeking new private investors for existing companies.
The assets to be sold include shares held in aluminium product manufacturers
in Belgium, Central America, Puerto Rico and Venezuela.
Aluminium is Venezuela's second-largest source of export revenues, after
petroleum. However, despite being among the world's lowest cost producers of
primary aluminium, the country's government-controlled aluminium smelters
are generating embarrassing amounts of red ink. Last year the state
aluminium sector lost a total of USDollars 168m and losses this year are
projected at about Dollars 218m. The sector also was in the red in 1991.
The state-controlled aluminium group is made up of Venalum (a smelter with
the world's largest installed capacity, owned 80 per cent by the Venezuelan
government and 20 per cent by a group of Japanese industrial companies);
Alcasa (a smelter with two laminating plants, owned 92 per cent by the
government and 8 per cent by Reynolds International); Interalumina (an
alumina facility; 98.7 per cent government-owned and 1.3 per cent
Alusuisse); plus a bauxite mine (Bauxiven) and an anode producer
(Carbonorca), both wholly-owned by the state. Except for Alcasa and Venalum,
the other companies are expected to earn profits this year.
Venalum has installed capacity for producing 430,000 tonnes a year of
primary aluminium (1992 output was 375,214 tonnes), while Alcasa's capacity
is 210,000 tonnes a year of primary metal and products (1992 output was
192,928 tonnes of primary aluminium and about 34,000 tonnes of products).
Mr Francisco Layrisse, minister of state and president of the Corporacion
Venezolana de Guayana, the state holding company that controls Venezuela's
largest steel, aluminium, mining and hydroelectric enterprises, says that
the government is attacking the aluminium problem by seeking private
investors to take over the biggest money loser, Alcasa; selling off some
Alcasa assets; and merging three other companies.
The CVG also wants to find international investors for other parts of the
industrial group, including iron ore, steel, and gold mining.
Alcasa, operating with only two of its four pot lines, is the sector's most
serious problem. While urgently (perhaps the word should be desperately)
seeking an international investor to take over the company, the CVG is
trying to sell one of the company's two laminating plants outright and will
sell Alcasa's shares in other aluminium companies in Venezuela and abroad.
Alcasa is a partner with Reynolds in Aleurope, a laminating and extruding
concern located in Belgium, and holds shares in Alunasa (Costa Rica) and
Alruss (Puerto Rico). It also has several joint ventures in Venezuela with
international companies, including General Motors, Reynolds, and BWA.
In addition, the CVG is merging all operations of Venalum, Interalumina and
Bauxiven and creating a single management team. It hopes to save money by
reducing executive personnel and integrating company strategies and
operations.
The CVG has been looking for private partners for Alcasa for some time, but
the gravity of the company's situation now has added a sense of urgency. In
the past, the Venezuelan government has been able to cover losses at Alcasa.
Now, however, the government is itself suffering from a large fiscal deficit
and cannot afford to finance losses at Alcasa or other state companies.
Although the government has not said so, it may be forced to close down
Alcasa entirely if heavy losses continue and a white knight fails to appear.
Like other world aluminium producers, Venezuela has been hit hard by
declining international prices. In the case of Alcasa, for example, the
smelter has older, less efficient pot lines (the first line was installed in
the 1960s) and suffers from operating and financial problems. During a
labour dispute earlier this month, workers walked off their jobs on one
production line, forcing the company to close down the entire line until
1994 for major repairs.
Basically, Venezuela's two large smelters began to post strong losses after
government export incentives were eliminated in 1989-90. They were never
able to exploit fully their great advantage: low-cost electric power from
the Guri hydroelectric complex located nearby.

FT  25 AUG 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: India slackens reins on coffee
trade - Liberalisation has improved growers' returns
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KUNAL BOSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PROCESS of liberalising the tightly controlled Indian coffee trade has
started, with growers being allowed to sell 30 per cent of their production
in the domestic market. But they are now demanding that be given the freedom
to export coffee directly as well.
The federal government is well disposed to the idea of privatising coffee
export, but the growers' participation in the trade will have to await
amendments to the Indian Coffee Act of 1942.
Liberalising foreign trade in coffee will lead to further dilution of the
role of the Coffee Board, which now controls exports through direct sales
and auctions. To start with, the government will perhaps allow the growers
to export certain grades of coffee subject to minimum price regulations.
Having realised better prices in the domestic market since the introduction
of the internal sale quota last season, the growers are confident that they
will do well in the export market too. The government, however, will push
through the amendments to the Coffee Act only when a consensus on gradually
privatising the export trade has been reached among the merchant exporters,
local traders, growers and Coffee Board employees' unions.
The All India Pool Sale Coffee Dealers Association fears that the domestic
market may be starved of the beverage if free exports are allowed. According
to an association official: 'Even under the ISQ, the domestic market is
facing a shortage of supplies, thanks to the big planters holding back
stocks.' The trade thinks that there is a domestic market for 60,000 tonnes
of coffee - the market might have been bigger had the Coffee Board given due
attention to the promotion of the beverage - but the quantity provided under
ISQ falls far short of that.
The trade has served notice that it will seek 'legal redress' if it is
denied 'supplies in right quantity and grades'. The growers have set their
sights on export because export prices are higher than domestic prices.
What, according to the trade, is forgotten, however, is that there will be a
'serious problem' of disposal of the crop in years of high production
because of the limited domestic market. The problem may arise this year as
India is expecting a bumper crop of 225,380 tonnes - including 101,470
tonnes of arabica and 123,910 tonnes of robusta. Nearly 75 per cent of the
area under coffee in Karnataka, Kerala and Tamil Nadu, the principal growing
areas, has received good blossom-time showers followed by backing showers.
Last year, India produced 161,500 tonnes of coffee and exported 113,078
tonnes, worth Rs3.79bn (Pounds 80m).
The pace of liberalisation of the coffee export trade will be slow till such
time the government has come to a decision about the future of the Coffee
Board and its nearly 4,000 employees. The growers, who believe that the
Board has largely outlived its utility, are ready to provide funds for the
voluntary retirement scheme for the Board employees.
There is a growing consensus that the Board should give up its marketing
role in phases and concentrate on research and development, farm extension
work and promotion.

FT  25 AUG 93 / Government Bonds: Overseas selling may signal end of bull
run in gilts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN and PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THERE were signs yesterday that the bull run in the UK government bond
market might be losing momentum.
It may have been straws in the wind, but dealers reported overseas selling,
particularly from Europe and eastern Asia. They also mentioned switching
into German and French government paper.
The main slide occurred in maturities longer than 10 years, the area which
recently experienced the biggest gains once the market had latched on to the
belief that the UK promised economic growth with low inflation. The 8.75 per
cent bonds expiring in 2017 fell  5/8 to 114 3/4.
Mr John Shepperd, gilts specialist with Yamaichi, the Japanese securities
house, said: 'It seems like there has been a bit of a mood change. People
had been buying into the dips and now they have started selling into them.
There is a feeling that gilts have hit fair value.'
Short-dated maturities, which respond to interest rate changes rather than
inflation perceptions, held steady ahead of a hoped-for rate cut in Germany
tomorrow.
Debate over a German rate cut continued to transfix the German debt market
while switching and position-taking ahead of an auction today unsettled
prices.
Investors were selling the most recent 10-year issue to buy bonds issued by
the Treuhand, the agency responsible for the sale of former East German
companies, because the spread between the two presented an arbitrage
opportunity.
Also, considerable interest from domestic and international investors ahead
of an auction of between DM4bn to DM6bn of four-year Schatz bonds diverted
attention. September bund futures traded on Liffe closed at 97.14,
marginally lower on the day, even though cost of living figures from
Baden-Wurttemberg were in line with forecasts and gave encouragement to
economists who have predicted a quarter point cut in the German discount
rate to 6.5 per cent.
FRENCH 10-year bonds were stronger as investors concerned over the
short-term prospects for interest rates switched out of shorter-dated paper.
The September Notionnel French government bond future on the Matif was a
quarter point firmer at best and ended a net 12 basis points higher.
AMONG the high yielders, Spanish bonds shrugged off disappointment that the
repo rate was left unchanged at 10.5 per cent as investors, particularly US
hedge funds, bought 10-year maturities up to near-record levels.
The rise in prices pushed the yield on 10-year paper down to around 9.27 per
cent. Mr Jouni Kokko of SG Warburg said 10-year yields had fallen from above
14 per cent since last October and his forecast of 8.8 per cent by the end
of the year was already looking conservative.
AUSTRALIAN bonds plunged as the currency fell sharply and dealers said
uncertainty over the future of the budget, which opposition parties have
threatened to block in the Senate, undermined market confidence.
The 9.5 per cent Commonwealth bond maturing in August 2003 fell 1 1/2 points
and the yield rose 21 basis points to 7.03 per cent. Dealers said investors
were principally nervous about the budget's path through parliament, with
the opposition parties calling for changes but the currency's slide by one
US cent overnight also dampened sentiment.
AFTER posting early declines, US Treasury prices rebounded sharply yesterday
following a strong afternoon auction of two-year notes. In late trading, the
benchmark 30-year government bond was up  3/8 at 100 3/4 , yielding 6.192
per cent. At the short end, the two-year note was up  5/32 at 100 23/32 , to
yield 3.842 per cent.
The market opened in listless fashion for the second consecutive day.
Dealers blamed the absence of fresh economic news, and a busy holiday week,
for the lack of interest in the market and the low levels of trading
activity.
The only feature of the morning was some manoeuvring by dealers and
investors ahead of the afternoon auction by the Treasury of Dollars 16bn in
two-year notes. Analysts said they expected the auction to go reasonably
well.
In the event, the sale proved even better than expected, and demand for the
new issue was especially strong from retail accounts. The success of the
sale lifted the market's mood, and sent prices sharply higher across the
maturity range.

FT  25 AUG 93 / International Bonds: Activity slows ahead of Bundesbank
decision
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ACTIVITY in the international bond market slowed considerably yesterday as
the Bundesbank's council meeting approached. The German central bank is
widely expected to cut interest rates when it meets tomorrow.
Syndicate managers said that investors were also keeping their powder dry in
order to take up the global bond issues by sovereign borrowers which are
expected to be launched in the coming weeks.
They also reported that a German regional bank could soon launch a 10-year,
zero-coupon bond denominated in lira to benefit from favourable swap
opportunities from the Italian currency into D-Marks.
The few deals which did emerge yesterday were concentrated in the Eurodollar
sector, as issuers took advantage of continued investor demand for senior
floating-rate assets denominated in dollars.
As a result, Spintab, the Swedish domestic mortgage association owned by
Swedbank, was able to increase its five-year offering of floating rate notes
(FRNs) by Dollars 50m to Dollars 250m.
The notes, which were priced at a slight discount to par, had a yield at
issue of 29 basis points over six-month London interbank offered rate
(Libor). The bonds were not freed to trade by yesterday afternoon.
An official at the lead manager, Kidder Peabody, said that the offering
represented a significant improvement in Spintab's funding costs. The all-in
cost to the issuer on yesterday's offering was 33 basis points over Libor,
compared with an all-in cost of 80 basis points over Libor on its Dollars
300m offering of five-year FRNs launched in February.
He added that the deal's good reception indicated that Scandinavian banks
were returning to favour with international investors after the industry's
financial difficulties during the past few years.
Kidder Peabody also arranged a Dollars 100m, five-year offering of FRNs for
BankAmerica Corp, for which it was the sole lead manager. The coupon of 25
basis points over three-month Libor was in line with yield spreads on
BankAmerica's existing international FRN offerings.
The City of Stockholm launched a swap-driven transaction in the Canadian
dollar sector. It raised CDollars 100m, which was believed to have been
exchanged for dollars, through an offering of five-year Eurobonds.
The bonds, which have a coupon of 6 3/4 per cent, were re-offered at 99.10
to yield 50 basis points over the 6 1/2 per cent Canadian Treasury due 1998.
When they were freed to trade, they were quoted at 99.10 bid.

CANADIAN SECURITIES regulators plan to make it easier for international
foreign companies to issue stock in Canada by amending prospectus
regulations.
If the plan goes through, big companies will be able to sell up to 10 per
cent of a global equity issue in Canada without issuing a separate Canadian
prospectus.
The Canadian investment industry has long complained that the costly
prospectus system and other restrictions have deprived them and Canadian
investors of lucrative opportunities.
The new policy will mean that provincial regulators will accept foreign
prospectuses as long as they meet basic disclosure requirements.

FT  25 AUG 93 / International Capital Markets: Austrian futures exchange
teaches bourse a lesson
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   VIENNA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MIDDLE Europeans like to gamble. That, according to an Austrian banker, is
the main explanation for the rapid growth of the Austrian Futures and
Options Exchange (OTOB).
Opened only 15 months ago, OTOB has become a bigger draw than the Vienna
bourse. The contract value of OTOB's stock options is regularly three times
as great as the volume of sales in the underlying shares. In other European
markets, this relationship tends to be roughly one to one.
OTOB is even making a mark in Europe. Last month, volume in its five stock
options was greater than the Paris MASIP exchange had on its 15. Options on
the shares of Creditanstalt Bankverein, a leading Austrian bank, have become
the third most popular bank stock options in Europe, after Union Bank of
Switzerland and CS Holding.
Developed on a shoestring budget of Sch110m (Dollars 9m), the exchange now
finds that it is likely to cover its operating costs in its second year of
operation.
At first glance, this performance is all the more surprising because
Austria's stock market is so unsuccessful. Activity there is so shallow that
only 18 shares are traded continuously, and the market's notoriety for
insider activity keeps individuals away in droves.
Individual investors account for only a tiny proportion of those who
regularly trade in shares, preferring, it was long thought, to stuff their
savings into the anonymous bank accounts that used to enable them to escape
tax.
But OTOB has found that most of those few individuals who still trade on the
stock exchange are sophisticated investors, and they were quick to take to
futures and options. 'We have a good retail base of four or five thousand
people who understand markets and like derivatives,' says Mr Christian Imo,
chief executive of OTOB.
Mr Imo estimates that retail investors provide about one-third of the volume
on the exchange, much more than on the Deutsche Termine Borse or on
Switzerland's Soffex.
The other reasons for the popularity of OTOB, he believes, are its
transparency and liquidity. The exchange operates electronically, with
market participants able to see on their screens all the bid and offered
prices as well as all the transactions as they happen.
OTOB is also fairly easy to understand and follow. Its product range is
limited to options on five leading shares, options and futures on the ATX
index of the 18 continuously traded shares and - the latest product line -
futures on a notional 10-year Austrian government bond.
The exchange insists on having at least three market makers for each
product, and they must provide prices on demand.
The success of OTOB has been a lesson to the Vienna bourse, which is now
rushing to install its own electronic trading system and to take other steps
to improve transparency. In October, insider trading is finally to become a
criminal offence.
Like other futures and options exchanges, OTOB has its problems, in
particular, finding ways to respond to the fast burgeoning competition from
over the counter derivative products offered by banks.
OTOB, whose options run only to six months, is planning to introduce longer
term options in the next few months on the ATX Index and on the
Creditanstalt share. It is also working on a future on a Vienna interbank
interest rate (Vibor).
Another challenge is linking with other futures and options exchanges.
OTOB's project with SOFFEX to allow each other's members to trade on both
exchanges was scuppered last month when SOFFEX directors disapproved.
Mr Imo does not conceal his disappointment, but he believes these links will
gradually come, especially as barriers between Austria and the European
Community come down.

FT  25 AUG 93 / International Company News: Way clear for US utility merger
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE DECISION by Ipalco Enterprises, parent of Indianapolis Power &amp; Light, to
end its bitter five-month, Dollars 1.73bn takeover bid for PSI Resources has
cleared the way for PSI's friendly merger with Cincinnati Gas &amp; Electric.
Mr John Hodowal, Ipalco chairman and chief executive, surprised PSI's annual
meeting on Monday by announcing that the company was dropping its Dollars
30.50 tender offer for PSI shares. This was because Ipalco had failed to
gain sufficient proxies to elect five candidates to PSI's 14-member board.
The fight for PSI, which supplies electricity to 600,000 customers in the
counties surrounding Indianapolis, is another ripple in a wave of
consolidation that analysts expect to sweep the US utility industry in the
coming years.
Until recently, hostile takeovers have been rare. However, with utilities
facing growing competition in the wake of federal deregulation, many are
seeking to trim their costs through economies of scale.
'I wouldn't be surprised to see 25 per cent of the industry involved in
consolidation over the next five years,' said Mr Daniel Scotto, an analyst
with Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Securities in New York. 'Already, in the
past three or four years, the industry has seen more consolidation than it
had over the previous 50 years.'
PSI has estimated that it would save about Dollars 1bn in fuel, maintenance
and other costs over the next 10 years through a merger with CG&amp;E. The two
utilities are proposing to form a new company, called CINergy, with
shareholders of each swapping their shares for shares in the group.
The value of the deal is linked to the value of shares in the Ohio-based
utility.
The PSI-CG&amp;E link is still contingent on regulatory approval. Indiana
utility regulators are expected to focus on the threat of predatory pricing,
which could endanger Ipalco, a utility that serves an area encircled by that
served by PSI. Ipalco's proposed takeover of PSI was largely a defensive
action to prevent its neighbouring rival from gaining a competitive edge.
State approval of the merger was not a foregone conclusion, said Mr Scotto.
He said regulators would examine how the deal would affect the state as a
whole. PSI would have to demonstrate clearly that the proposed merger would
indeed result in savings to ratepayers throughout the region.
Regulatory approval was the issue that appeared to turn the tide in the PSI
proxy fight away from the Ipalco proposal.

FT  25 AUG 93 / International Company News: Bell Atlantic wins court ruling
on cable TV service
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BELL ATLANTIC, the large east-coast telecommunications company, yesterday
won an important legal victory which could make it the first US local
telephone company offering cable television in its telephone service area.
It said a US district court in Alexandria, Virginia, had declared
unconstitutional a provision in the 1984 Cable Act blocking telephone
companies from providing cable programming in areas where they also provide
a telephone service.
US local telephone companies, which are keen to enter the potentially
lucrative cable business, have lobbied Congress for years to have the ban
removed. The cable industry, meanwhile, has insisted the provision was
necessary to protect it from the monopolistic local telephone companies.
The case, which seems likely to go to appeal, sets a significant legal
precedent and may prompt other local telephone companies to mount cases in
their parts of the country.
Bell Atlantic, one of the seven regional 'Baby Bell' telephone companies
spun off in the mid-1980s from American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, filed suit
last December in Alexandria against the US government agencies responsible
for overseeing the 1984 Act.
It wants initially to offer a cable television service to 60,000 customers
in Alexandria, just across the Potomac River from Washington DC, using
modern fibre optic technology. It would be in competition with existing
cable operator, Jones Intercable.
Bell Atlantic said the Alexandria court ruled the 1984 Act violated its
rights to free speech under the First Amendment to the US constitution. The
court had removed the ban in all seven states where the company provides a
telephone service.
The cable industry seems certain to appeal the ruling. The federal
government could also object, although the executive branch has, in recent
years, generally favoured breaking down the regulatory barriers separating
various parts of the communications industry.
Bell Atlantic also needs the approval of the Federal Communications
Commission, the government agency overseeing the industry, for its specific
plans to upgrade its network in Alexandria. It said it could be serving its
first customers in the town some six to 12 months after FCC approval.
Bell Atlantic has been one of the most aggressive local telephone companies
in seeking to enter the cable television field.

<TEXT>
BANK OF MONTREAL, Canada's third-biggest chartered bank, yesterday reported
third-quarter net profits of CDollars 180m (USDollars 136m), or 66 cents a
share, slightly better than expected.
This compared with CDollars 173m, or 64 cents a share, a year earlier.
The bank's chairman, Mr Matthew Barrett, said that despite higher provisions
for credit losses, loan volumes were higher and securities trading and other
income were up strongly. He said costs had been kept under control.
Total revenues were up 7 per cent in the quarter, which ended July, and
managed to grow at a faster rate than expenses.
Most Canadian analysts had estimated the bank's third-quarter net profit
would be 63 cents a share, said Mr Roy Palmer, bank analyst with Bunting
Warburg in Montreal.
For the first nine months of the year, the bank earned CDollars 508m, or
CDollars 1.85 a share, up 5.9 per cent from CDollars 480m, or CDollars 1.79
a share, a year earlier.
Revenues rose 8.9 per cent and the increase in expenses, after exchange
factors and taxes, was held to less than 2 per cent. Return on average
equity was 13.6 per cent, against 14.4 per cent a year earlier.
Provision for credit losses was increased 4 per cent to CDollars 675m.
Non-performing loans totalled CDollars 2.1bn at end-July, up 2 per cent.
Total assets stood at CDollars 111bn, against CDollars 105bn a year earlier.
Bank of Montreal is the first of Canada's big six commercial banks to report
its third-quarter results.

HONG Kong Aircraft Engineering Company (Haeco), a Swire Pacific group
company, yesterday announced an 18 per cent increase in net profit for the
six months ended June. The result was HKDollars 213.8m (USDollars 27.4m), up
from HKDollars 180.5m in 1992.
Turnover increased by 10 per cent to HKDollars 1.01bn. This was attributed
to heavy utilisation of the company's airframe maintenance and engine
overhaul facilities.
Earnings were also boosted by a maiden contribution from the group's 26 per
cent-owned Australian aircraft maintenance company, Asta Aircraft Services,
which had been a consistent lossmaker.
The interim dividend is going up to 30 cents a share, against 27 cents in
1992.

FT  25 AUG 93 / International Company News: Nissan cuts European suppliers
to UK and Spanish plants
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NISSAN, the Japanese carmaker, has reduced the number of European-based
components producers supplying its vehicle assembly plants in the UK and
Spain by 8 per cent in the last year.
It has cut the number of its suppliers in Europe to 431 from 470 a year ago,
and the total is expected to fall to between 350 and 400 by the end of the
decade, according to Mr Bob Hampson, Nissan Europe's purchasing general
manager.
The reduction of its supplier base, a trend common throughout the motor
industry, is part of its attempts to rationalise the number of companies
supplying its separate vehicle manufacturing operations in the UK and Spain.
Of its current suppliers in Europe, Nissan has 214 in Spain, 143 in the UK,
36 in Germany, 20 in France, and seven in Italy.
Its two European manufacturing operations, Nissan Motor Manufacturing in the
UK and Nissan Motor Iberica in Spain, are expected to buy components in
Europe worth around Pounds 1.2bn (Dollars 800m) this year, said Mr Hampson.
NMUK, Nissan's Pounds 900m car plant at Sunderland, in north-east England,
is forecasting total components purchases in Europe in 1993 of Pounds 850m
from its 198 suppliers, with an output of around 270,000 cars.
The Spanish operation, which is forecasting output this year of around
90,000 vehicles - most importantly the Terrano II/Ford Maverick four-wheel
drive leisure utility vehicle and the Serena multipurpose vehicle - will
purchase components worth around Pounds 350m from a total of 270 suppliers.
The main reduction in supplier numbers has already been achieved by Nissan
Motor Iberica, which been more than halved its supply base from 560
suppliers five years ago.
At present, only 37 of Nissan's suppliers in Europe produce components for
both its UK and Spanish operations. However, Nissan is pushing hard to
increase the number of common suppliers as an important step in cutting the
heavy losses of its less efficient Spanish business.
The number of suppliers to its UK car plant has grown from 31 in 1986, when
the Sunderland factory first began small-volume production, to the present
level of 198.
The main effort to rationalise the supply base will continue to be in Spain,
where Nissan acquired the former Motor Iberica operations in the early
1980s, together with its diffuse supplier network then common to the
European motor industry.

FT  25 AUG 93 / International Company News: Matsushita Electric suffers 7%
fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MATSUSHITA Electric, hit by weak sales and a strengthening yen, yesterday
reported a 7 per cent decline, to Y33.7bn (Dollars 326.2m), in first-quarter
consolidated pre-tax profits.
The Japanese consumer electronics group said sales were down 7 per cent, to
Y1,596bn compared with a previous Y1,713bn. Net income was 23 per cent lower
at Y6.7bn against Y8.7bn.
Matsushita, in common with other Japanese consumer electronics
manufacturers, has suffered the impact of the high yen, continuing sluggish
demand for audio-visual products, and a cool summer in Japan.
Although sales in overseas markets were actually higher than the previous
first quarter on a local currency basis, the gains evaporated under the
impact of the higher yen, Matsushita said.
In Japan, the company continued to face weak demand as consumer spending
tailed away. The weakness of personal consumption and private capital
spending have been cited as the main factors preventing the Japanese economy
from recovering.
Sales of video products declined 13 per cent, while audio equipment fell 6
per cent on slow demand.
Home appliances were down 13 per cent as sales of air conditioners were hurt
by an unusually cool summer in Japan. Demand for communication and
industrial equipment was also weak.
Matsushita is currently enjoying huge box-office success with Jurassic Park,
a movie produced by its MCA film studio subsidiary. However, it still
suffered a 2 per cent decline in sales from its entertainment businesses.
This was blamed on the yen's appreciation, which more than offset an
increase in dollar-based sales, the company said.
Although Matsushita has had some recent consumer successes, such as an
advanced rice cooker, and cordless telephones, it has faced prolonged
weakness in the Japanese market, particularly for audio-visual products.
The strong demand expected for key products, such as the digital compact
cassette, a digital portable audio format developed with Philips, the Dutch
consumer electronics group, has not materialised. It will take considerable
time for demand to emerge for other promising products, such as
high-definition TV.
The company's second-quarter results are expected to be disappointing.
Private consumption is not expected to improve significantly in the near
term, unless the government agrees to an income tax cut soon.

Indonesian listed banks

   JAKARTA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INDONESIA'S stock market-listed banks have announced mostly improved results
for the first half of 1993. They were helped by an increase in lending as
banks lowered interest rates but maintained margins.
Bank Internasional Indonesia posted a 35 per cent rise in gross profit, to
Rp83.7bn (Dollars 39.9m), while gross profits at Lippobank rose 54 per cent
to Rp31.3bn. Gross profits at Bank Niaga climbed 6.6 per cent to Rp22.4bn,
and at Panin Bank by 5 per cent to Rp21.46bn.
Bank Bali was alone among the leading listed banks to report lower gross
profits. It suffered a 14.3 per cent setback to Rp42.5bn.
Most banks have also seen an increase in loan growth and deposits.
Lippobank's loans in the first half grew 15 per cent after asset
reclassification, to Rp3,090bn, and deposits rose 10 per cent to Rp3,400bn.
BII's loans and deposits grew 8.5 per cent and 11 per cent, to Rp3,850bn and
Rp3,885bn respectively.
The banks have taken advantage of the lending constraints on state banks,
which account for about half the sector's assets. Most state banks have
failed to reach higher capital adequacy requirements set by the central bank
and have been told to limit new lending.
Local brokers expect listed banks to raise more capital by the end of this
year to further increase loan growth.

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S Big Four brokers - Nomura Securities, Daiwa Securities, Nikko
Securities and Yamaichi Securities - have moved into the banking business by
setting up trust banking subsidiaries.
The move follows April's partial deregulation of the barriers between the
banking and securities industries in Japan. It follows the the creation of
securities subsidiaries by the three long-term credit banks and Norinchukin,
the central agricultural institution.
The move into the trust banking business will have little immediate impact
on the brokers' group profits or to the operations of existing trust banks.
The range of businesses of the new banking subsidiaries will be limited to
investment trusts, land trusts and foreign exchange.
The new trust banks, capitalised between Y20bn (Dollars 194m) and Y30bn,
will not have access to the special loan trusts, or tokkin funds, the
specified investment trust funds, thus the territory of the existing trust
banks will be protected.
The securities subsidiaries of the long-term credit banks, including
Industrial Bank of Japan and Long-Term Credit Bank, started underwriting
bonds in June. The brokers fear that the banks, which have links to leading
stock market-listed companies, have more to gain from liberalisation.
Mr David Marshall, analyst at IBCA, the banking credit agency, said the
brokers' entry into the banking business would have little impact on the
financial industry in the foreseeable future.
The new subsidiaries, along with Bank of Tokyo's new trust banking unit,
will start operations around October, after authorisation from the ministry
of finance.

FT  25 AUG 93 / International Company News: Northam hit by mine production
shortfalls
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FAILURE to achieve production targets was blamed for an accumulated loss of
R47.1m (Dollars 14m) for the year ended June at Northam, the platinum mine
in the Gold Fields group. Northam, which raised R350m through a rights issue
last January, has been forced to seek further funding. The mine has so far
cost R1.5bn to bring to production.
Mr John Hopwood, chairman, blamed the mine's problems on the fact that it
had been operating at milling rates of around 80,000 tonnes per month,
against a target of 150,000 tonnes.
He said the situation was improving. The milling rate rose to 100,000 tonnes
in July, and another increase in August looked likely. He said target
milling rates should be reached by the middle of this financial year.

SAMANCOR, the South African chrome and manganese producer, reports steeply
lower profits for the year ended June. It is cutting its dividend from 90
cents a share to 50 cents, Reuter reports from Johannesburg.
Turnover fell from R2.06bn (Dollars 613m) to R1.79bn, and the weak business
background translated into pre-tax profits of R144.4m, down from R381.5m in
the previous year.
Attributable net earnings, following a one-off rationalisation charge of
R42m and a tax credit of R53m, were R175.6m, against R277.1m.
Samancor hopes to form joint ventures with two French and Japanese companies
this year to secure outlets for products and so enhance its market position.
It said its manganese division was finalising a joint venture with Societe
du Ferromanganese de Paris-Outreau of France to produce medium carbon
ferromanganese.
Samancor expects to take a 5 per cent equity stake in the French company for
a 'relatively modest investment'. Its chrome division is also negotiating an
agreement with Japan's Nippon Denko.

<TEXT>
CALTEX, the Australian petroleum group, has again passed its dividend
despite a strong earnings recovery in the six months to June.
The company lifted net profit to ADollars 35.5m (USDollars 23.6m) from
ADollars 7.9m for the half-year, on a 7 per cent revenue rise to ADollars
1.75bn. The result followed a widening of operating margins, and a ADollars
9.7m benefit from lower tax.
Interest costs eased from ADollars 27.3m to ADollars 26.2m.
However, falling crude oil prices and petroleum product discounting is
clouding the outlook for the current six months, Caltex says. As a result,
there is again no interim dividend.
Bank of Melbourne, the regional bank, has shrugged off a big increase in
doubtful debt provisions to record a strong profit lift for the year ended
June.
Net earnings have jumped from ADollars 8.6m to ADollars 91.2m despite a 7
per cent fall, to ADollars 547.9m, in total revenue. The dividend is going
up from 13 to 30 cents a share.
The result reflected a ADollars 74m abnormal loss in the previous year.
Gross profit rose just 5 per cent to ADollars 87.1m. Doubtful debt provision
rose 47 per cent to ADollars 42.6m.
Tax provision took ADollars 36m, against ADollars 2.5m previously.

PWA, parent of Canadian Airlines, has rejected Air Canada's offer to buy its
international routes for CDollars 200m (USDollars 151m) and assumption of
CDollars 800m debt and lease obligations, writes Robert Gibbens.
PWA said its directors decided the offer would 'adversely affect' the
interests of shareholders, creditors, employees and customers.
Mr Rhys Eyton, PWA chairman, said the net purchase price would really be
CDollars 100m for routes generating CDollars 1.4bn annual revenues. Also,
PWA would be left with 23 surplus aircraft. Total cost of downsizing
Canadian Airlines to a domestic and trans-border carrier would be CDollars
440m, he said.

GERMANY'S computerised stock exchange trading system Ibis will be extended
to include trade in 16 D-Mark Eurobonds, Reuter reports from Frankfurt. The
extension takes effect in two weeks.
The new Eurobonds are heavily-traded issues from sovereign, supranational
and private issuers. Ibis was launched in April 1991 to trade the 30 shares
which form the Dax index and 30 government bond issues. Six more shares and
21 option certificates were added last year.

THE rapid appreciation of the yen and weak demand in leading markets
depressed first-quarter consolidated profits at Honda, the Japanese
carmaker, which yesterday reported a 62 per cent drop in net income for the
period.
Honda saw consolidated revenues in the three months ended June fall by 17
per cent to Y919.6bn (Dollars 8.9bn) compared with Y1,112bn previously.
Pre-tax profits fell to Y15.3bn, or less than half their previous level of
Y34.2bn.
Honda said it had been severely affected by the sharp rise of the yen which
hit profits in its largest markets overseas, particularly the US, where it
sold more cars than in its home market.
The company is re-examining its forecast of Y4,000bn in revenues for the
entire year, which was made on expectations of an average yen-dollar
exchange rate at Y115 to the dollar. The yen has recently been fluctuating
closer to a rate of Y103 to the dollar.
The rise of the yen's value has already led to a loss of Y25bn, even after
taking into effect any gains made from hedging, Honda said.
Motorcycle sales were firm in unit terms, rising 12 per cent from the first
quarter of last year. However, due to the impact of the higher yen, sales in
the division were 2.6 per cent lower at Y146bn.
Honda has seen strong demand for its motorcycles in the US and Asia,
excluding Japan. Demand in the US rose strongly as Honda has offered more
higher value-added models while growth in Asia was spurred as incomes in the
region have risen.
Car sales fell 21 per cent in value terms to Y704.9bn and 11 per cent in
unit terms, reflect-ing the continued weakness of demand in all of Honda's
leading markets outside of the Asian region, excluding Japan.
'The current level of the yen will make it very difficult for us to carry
out our operations,' Honda said. It has been forced to raise US prices once
this year and would suffer if it raised them again.
Honda expects to shift more production overseas. Exports from its US
facilities, which could step up capacity, could increase in future not only
to Japan where its US-made Accord is selling well, but to other parts of the
world.
The company has implemented cost-cutting efforts, reduced one of its lines
in Japan to one shift, cut seasonal workers by about half and transferred
some car staff to motorcycle operations.

EARNINGS of Deere and Company, the US agricultural equipment manufacturer,
surged in the third quarter amid signs that confidence is returning in the
North American agricultural economy.
Deere said retail sales of combine harvesters and tractors continued to
improve in spite of record rains in the US midwest and drought in parts of
the south-east.
US farmers, who have been conservative about new equipment purchases because
of their cautious outlook on the economy, have excellent prospects in much
of the country, said Mr Hans Becherer, chairman.
As well as strong agricultural sales, Mr Becherer said heavy rainfall and
improving economic conditions boosted demand for Deere's lawncare equipment,
while increases in housing starts and higher public construction
expenditures in the US are also expected to benefit the company's industrial
sales.
However, he said overseas demand for Deere agricultural equipment is
expected to remain weak.
Deere's third-quarter earnings surged to Dollars 100.1m, or Dollars 1.31 a
share, compared with Dollars 9.1m, or 12 cents, in the third quarter of
1992.
In the quarter, Deere's North American sales of all equipment products rose
26 per cent to Dollars 1.3bn, compared with Dollars 1bn in the third quarter
of 1992. Overseas sales rose 2 per cent to Dollars 436m. Net worldwide sales
were Dollars 2.05bn, up from Dollars 1.75bn.
Sales of agricultural equipment rose 16 per cent to Dollars 1.1bn,
industrial equipment sales were up 27 per cent to Dollars 396m and lawn and
grounds care equipment sales rose 24 per cent to Dollars 240m.
Before an Dollars 80m restructuring charge taken in the second quarter to
reduce the European operations, worldwide net income for the first nine
months ended July was Dollars 182.7m, or Dollars 2.39 a share. This compares
with last year's Dollars 33.2m, or 44 cents.

<TEXT>
UNIDANMARK, Denmark's second-largest bank group, moved back into profit of
DKr483m (Dollars 69.77m) in the first half compared with a loss of DKr1.47bn
in the same period last year and a loss of DKr4.54bn in the whole of 1992.
The bank said the result was in line with the budget and with the recovery
strategy drawn up last autumn.
Costs were down by 6.2 per cent to DKr3.05bn from last year, with a
reduction of 9.4 per cent in staffing to 11,453 compared with June 30 last
year.
But the bank's forecast for the full year was cautious, promising 'a
substantially improved net result than last year,' but leaving open the
possibility of a loss.
The bank's loss provisions remained high at DKr2.34bn compared with
DKr2.44bn in the first half of last year and DKr6.28bn in the whole of 1992.
Provisions this year, the bank forecast, will be reduced.
The group's London subsidiary, Unidanmark Holding, cut a DKr506m loss in the
first half last year to DKr168m. The London bank suffered from heavy losses
in the property market. A big improvement in the value adjustment for the
securities portfolio was the main factor behind the group's move back into
profit.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LOWER underwriting losses and heavy investment gains enabled Trygg-Hansa
SPP, Sweden's leading insurance company, to report improved results for the
first six months as the group restructured following big losses last year
associated with the country's banking crisis.
Operating profits of SKr884m (Dollars 109m) were slightly down on the
comparative figure of SKr898m at the same stage last year, but this was
largely due to a 58 per cent fall in contributions from the 35 per cent-held
Home Holdings group in the US to SKr42m from SKr101m.
Otherwise, core insurance profits rose 10 per cent to SKr303m from SKr275m
as premiums - up 2 per cent at SKr3.95bn - outstripped a marginal rise in
claims costs. Trygg said the recession in Sweden had trimmed premiums at
home by 4 per cent, but claims costs fell by 7 per cent and a trend of
spiralling claims in recent years had been checked.
Meanwhile, there was a 4 per cent increase in premiums from international
insurance to SKr775m, while claims costs fell 14 per cent to SKr465.
The group also showed benefits from the upward trend this year in capital
markets. Unrealised capital gains, mainly in Trygg's bond portfolio, sent
overall profits rocketing to SKr1.65bn from SKr436m.
The group's solvency margin - the ratio of shareholders funds to premiums -
at the end of the period stood at 151 per cent, compared with 134 per cent
at the end of 1992. Claims costs from reinsurance rose in the first half to
SKr1.23bn from SKr932m.

FT  25 AUG 93 / International Company News: ABB managers strip for action -
The Swiss engineering group's streamlining
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SINCE 1988, when Mr Percy Barnevik led Sweden's Asea engineering and
robotics group into a merger with the venerable but flagging Swiss power
engineering group Brown Boveri, the new ABB Asea Brown Boveri has hardly
paused for breath.
But a new streamlined management structure unveiled by Mr Barnevik yesterday
suggests that this uniquely multinational industrial group could move even
faster in the future.
In the past five years, ABB has acquired some 60 companies all over the
world, some of them, such as Combustion Engineering in the US, huge.
It has also marched boldly into eastern Europe, buying up rundown
engineering companies and successfully injecting western management
techniques. More recently, it has focused on fast growing Asian markets for
its heavy infrastructure products.
Along the way, ABB managers have closed dozens of plants and, since the
spring of 1990, eliminated more than 40,000 jobs. The group's non-recurring
charges typically run at over Dollars 100m a year.
But it now can claim that its Dollars 32bn in annual sales are spread fairly
evenly among the world's three main economic regions, whereas at the outset
it was active mainly in European markets. It also claims to be the world's
largest power engineering group whereas Asea and Brown Boveri were marginal
players.
However, it is not only ABB that has changed. As Mr Barnevik observes, the
creation of huge, rather protectionist, regional trading blocks has happened
with surprising speed. The economic integration of central and eastern
European countries into the European block is also proceeding apace. And the
elimination of protectionist barriers between western European countries is
accelerating.
For a group which produces heavy infrastructure equipment - from power
stations to railway locomotives - these changes have a big impact on the way
it should conduct its business.
One consequence has been faster growth of large turnkey projects. Developing
countries have always tended to purchase infrastructure on a turnkey basis
because they did not have the engineering skills themselves. Now developed
countries are moving that way as well, as privatised utilities shed the huge
in-house design and engineering bureaucracies that flourished under state
ownership.
Mr Barnevik recalled yesterday that when ABB was formed, his main objective
was to make managers within the group's thousands of operating units more
responsible for performance. No fewer than 5,000 profit centres were
established. The emphasis was on decentralisation and as few layers of
middle management as possible.
He still likes those principles, but he and other ABB directors have found
that they, and the management structures built to implement them, were not
enough for the new environment in which they operate.
ABB managers have been fairly successful in preventing individual ABB
companies from competing against each other for business, but they have
failed so far to bring together all their resources for making bids on big
turnkey projects.
Various group divisions supply most of the technology and equipment needed
to build steel rolling mills and pulp and paper mills. However, as the
know-how and marketing efforts are dispersed, ABB seldom makes effective
bids for large integrated projects.
'We want to facilitate integrated system thinking,' Mr Barnevik says.
Thus, the power distribution and power transmission divisions are being
combined. Most of the 'various activities' division is being put into an
industrial plants division.
ABB has so far used the popular matrix management system, under which
directors have both regional and line responsibilities. But in the new
executive board, this is being simplified, with three directors having only
regional responsibilities and four only divisional responsibilities.
Mr Barnevik said some board directors had been choking under the complexity
of their responsibilities. The solution will be to push more tasks down to
the next layer of management.
It remains to be seen how this will work out in practice. Mr Barnevik made
clear that no management consultants had been used in the design of the new
structure. 'We have enough management talent here that if we put our heads
together, we should not need consultants.'
One thing is certain; the pace of change at ABB will remain brisk.
Commenting on the group's decision to provide Dollars 500m for plant
closures this year, Mr Barnevik said he was unhappy having to put large sums
into the profit and loss account every year for non-recurring costs.
'A group like ours will have to live with restructuring as a normal part of
its business. So we are doing this big move now, and then I hope to get out
of the habit of reporting non-recurring costs.'
Asked what he thought an acceptable annual level of unhighlighted
restructuring costs might be, he replied, 'about 1 per cent of invoicing'.

strong recovery

<TEXT>
SVENSKA Handelsbanken yesterday announced plans to raise nearly SKr2.7bn
(Dollars 531m) from shareholders after demonstrating a strong recovery in
first-half operating profits and confidence in future prospects.
The bank wants to be able to meet increased loan demand as the Nordic
economies recover and to expand its network in the region further. It says a
stronger balance sheet should also improve its credit rating.
It is the fourth Nordic bank to announce plans for a big share issue in less
than two weeks, following similar moves by its Swedish rival Skandinaviska
Enskilda Banken and the Finnish banking groups Kansallis-Osake-Pankki and
Unitas. All are taking advantage of higher share prices and a belief that
the worst of the Nordic banking crisis is over to bolster their balance
sheets and stave off a credit crunch when loan demand rises.
Handelsbanken's one-for-two issue is being made at SKr35 per share, a deep
discount on the SKr128 level at which the shares closed yesterday. The issue
will lift the bank's capital adequacy ratio from 10.3 per cent to 12.3 per
cent.
First-half operating profit was SKr837m, against a SKr658m loss in the same
1992 period. However, the figure disappointed the market, and the shares
fell SKr18, or more than 12 per cent, from SKr146.
Operating profit before loan losses rose 34 per cent to SKr4.46bn, helped by
a 10 per cent increase in net interest income.
Credit losses remained high at SKr3.63bn, or 2.6 per cent of total lending,
reflecting the long Swedish recession and the collapse in the property
sector. Non-performing loans were slightly ahead of their year-end level at
SKr15.8bn.
The bank did not give a full-year forecast, but said it intended to resume
paying dividends on its ordinary shares this year.
The bank has taken advantage of its relative strength during the Nordic
banking crisis to expand its operations outside Sweden. It now ranks as
Norway's fifth-largest commercial bank, and has plans to build up operations
in Denmark and Finland. It is also interested in buying parts of Gota Bank,
which the Swedish government wants to return to the private sector.

SUNLEIGH, the USM-quoted leisure products group, lifted pre-tax profits from
Pounds 11,000 to Pounds 208,000 in the first half of 1993 despite
substantial losses by PJO, its last remaining industrial business, which was

Operating profit from continuing operations rose from Pounds 77,000 to
Pounds 487,000 on sales revenue ahead 39 per cent from Pounds 6.13m to
Pounds 8.55m. Including Gavel - acquired in April 1992 - for a full six
months in both periods the sales rise was Pounds 504,000 and operating
profit advance Pounds 606,000.
Earnings worked through at 0.05p (0.1p losses).
Mr Robert Upsdell, chairman, said that the commitment to the organic
development of the core businesses by investing in new products was 'already
justified by the encouraging results.'

FT  25 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Monument Oil and Gas ahead to Pounds 5.7m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MONUMENT OIL and Gas, the UK exploration and production company, saw pre-tax
profit more than double, from Pounds 2.1m to Pounds 5.66m, in the half year
to June 30.
'We've been through an extremely tough period with the coal review. Oil
prices are still weak, but we've been able to preserve our cash and expand
overseas,' said Mr Tony Craven-Walker, managing director.
The government's coal review had placed a question mark over the development
of the Liverpool Bay oil and gas field - in which Monument is involved -
since it had threatened to withhold approval for the Connah's Quay power
station which is to burn the gas.
However, Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, approved
Connah's Quay at the end of March and the Liverpool Bay project is to go
ahead later this year. Mr Craven-Walker said Monument's share of the funding
for the Pounds 2bn project was Pounds 270m, which the company was hoping to
raise on a project finance basis.
Mr Craven-Walker warned the City that debt levels in the company would rise
significantly as it embarked on the development of Liverpool Bay. He said
the second half of this year was a 'major milestone,' for the company, with
Liverpool Bay expected to generate substantial future cash flow.
Monument is beginning to expand overseas as opportunities in the North Sea
dry up. It has targeted South America and south-east Asia for expansion. The
company has drilled its first well in Argentina and is currently drilling
two more: it will have the results in several weeks. Monument is also
exploring in Bolivia.
He still sees some room for growth in the North Sea where Monument put in
place Pounds 12m financing for the Johnston gas field and began development
in June.
Earnings per share jumped to 0.8p (0.29p) but the company has decided not to
pay a dividend because of the heavy financing costs to come in the second
half.
Turnover fell to Pounds 17.2m (Pounds 20.8m). Production slipped to 7,900
barrels a day after the disposal of the Buchan field. But output is set to
increase substantially when Liverpool Bay comes on stream in late 1995.

Net asset value per share, after deducting prior charges at par, of the
Scottish Eastern Investment Trust stood at 86.6p at July 31. That compared
with 79.2p at the January 31 year end and with 62.8p a year ago.
Pre-tax revenue for the half year fell from Pounds 7.7m to Pounds 6.8m,
partly due, the company said, to increased investments in Japan. Net revenue
emerged at Pounds 5.12m (Pounds 5.55m).
Despite the fall in earnings from 0.87p to 0.8p the interim dividend is
raised to 0.52p (0.5p).

FT  25 AUG 93 / UK Company News: River Merc Smaller
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
River &amp; Mercantile Smaller Companies Trust saw its net asset value rise from
99.27p to 132.2p per share over the 12 months to July 31.
The 33 per cent advance matched the rise in the FT-SE SmallCap Index
(Excluding Investment Trusts), and outperformed the FT-A All-Share Index,
which rose some 27 per cent over the same period.
Attributable revenue improved to Pounds 1.02m (Pounds 924,000) for earnings
of 4.07p (3.69p) per share. A recommended final dividend of 2.75p lifts the
total for the year to 4p (3.9p).

BASS has signed a joint venture agreement with INN Realty Hotel Ventures of
India to develop 70 franchised Holiday Inn hotels throughout India over the
next 10 years, writes Philip Rawstorne.
The joint venture will focus on secondary cities, catering to a domestic
market of an estimated 30m households.
Bass has only four Holiday Inn franchises in the subcontinent, at Bombay,
Bangalore, Hyderabad and New Delhi.
It said yesterday that it had identified a growing demand for top-class
hotel accommodation throughout the country.

FT  25 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Bridon jumps 57% despite costs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRIDON, the Doncaster-based maker of ropes and other engineered products,
lifted first-half pre-tax profits by 57 per cent, from Pounds 700,000 to
Pounds 1.1m, in spite of a rise in restructuring costs from Pounds 500,000
to Pounds 1.2m.
The advance in operating profits, from Pounds 3.4m to Pounds 4m, in the six
months to June 30, was described by Mr Brian Clayton, chairman, as a 'useful
improvement' and he predicted further advances as the benefits of the
restructuring flowed through.
In the short term, however, he said 'market conditions are expected to
remain relatively unhelpful and continuing cost reduction remains the main
driving force in our efforts to improve margins.'
Bridon also announced yesterday that it had won two bridge contracts worth
Pounds 2.5m for the second Severn crossing between England and Wales and a
bridge in Sydney, Australia.
Mr Clayton said that contract work was now making an increasing contribution
to turnover at the wire ropes division. The group is planning to invest
Pounds 2m in the next 12 months in this sector.
UK exports also benefited from improved margins because of sterling's
devaluation.
Wire ropes contributed Pounds 112.6m (Pounds 107m) to group turnover of
Pounds 163.8m (Pounds 162.5m). Operating profits from wire ropes doubled to
Pounds 2.6m. Operating profits from fibre products fell to Pounds 200,000
(Pounds 900,000); industrial textiles contributed Pounds 200,000 following a
Pounds 100,000 loss previously; and engineering profits were Pounds 1m
(Pounds 1.3m).
Earnings per share rose to 1.6p (1.3p) and the interim dividend is unchanged
at 1.25p.
The restructuring costs - incurred within the wire ropes sector - included
the closure of the fish ropery in Beverley, Humberside.
The full-year results will include further restructuring costs.
The group has shed almost 1,000 employees in the last two and a half years,
leaving 4,453 at June 30.
Working capital fell from Pounds 73.7m to Pounds 59.9m through control on
stocks and debtors.

FT  25 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Graseby to cut pay-out to ensure expansion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GRASEBY, the electronics group, is to cut its final dividend to retain more
funds for expansion.
The group, which yesterday announced pre-tax profits up 18 per cent to
Pounds 4.87m in the six months to June 30, will maintain an interim payment
of 3.3p.
But at the full year it will pay only another 3.3p, making 6.6p for the
year, a substantial fall on last year's total of 10.7p.
Mr Paul Lester, chief executive, said he felt it was right to maintain the
dividend while the group had been restructuring following its acquisition of
Tace and Goring Kerr two years ago and the sale of most of Cambridge
Electronics' businesses from which Graseby evolved.
The board now felt it was appropriate to retain more of the cash within the
company to fund growth. The shares fell 6p to close at 179p on news of the
dividend cut.
The company's scope for investment in its businesses has been hampered by a
high level of debt and the cash drain from its dividend payments.
In March the group said it planned to strengthen the balance sheet by
floating its US environmental business on Nasdaq, raising about Dollars 25m
(Pounds 16.7m) but retaining control.
This would be floated once market sentiment in the US environmental sector
had improved, possibly by the first quarter of next year.
Graseby's half year profits rise represented a 12 per cent increase in
earnings from 5.1p to 5.7p. Sales grew 22 per cent to Pounds 55.1m.
Gearing rose from less than 100 per cent to 119 per cent at the end of the
period on net debt of Pounds 26.7m as a result of payment of the Pounds 4.7m
dividend bill.
COMMENT
Setting a more conservative dividend policy was always on the cards once a
decent interval had elapsed after the restructuring. By cutting the dividend
payment and floating the US business, Graseby could within 12 months have
repaid all its debt, finally allowing acquisitions that involve goodwill
write-offs. The hitch is if Graseby is forced to delay flotation of its US
businesses because the environmental sector remains in the doldrums - it has
underperformed by 20 per cent in the past six months. But even without the
float proceeds, profits are likely to be Pounds 10.5m for the full year,
giving 11.7p of earnings and a market rating justified by the yield premium
that still remains after the dividend cut.

FT  25 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Riva falls Pounds 425,000 into the red
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES OF Riva Group, the USM-traded supplier of electronic point of sale
systems, yesterday fell 6p to 27p on news of a swing from pre-tax profits of
Pounds 314,000 to losses of Pounds 425,000 for the half year to June 30.
Turnover fell from Pounds 28.6m to Pounds 26.4m and operating profits from
Pounds 972,000 to Pounds 164,000. Exceptional provision rose to Pounds
252,000 (Pounds 174,000).
Trading conditions remained difficult and operations in Europe were severely
affected by recession. In January and February trading was poor and led to
changes in European operations.
Staffing levels in France were substantially reduced, the unprofitable
business in Germany was in the process of being sold and at the Spanish
subsidiary, which incurred a deficit of Pounds 377,000 during the half year,
urgent measures were being pursued to improve performance.
However, group trading from March to June had shown an improvement which,
combined with further reductions in overheads, had brought a return to
profitability on a month by month basis.
The directors anticipated some improvement in the second half but warned
that the final outcome was dependent on the extent of the cost of remedial
actions required in Spain.
Basic losses per share were 1.9p (earnings of 1p). A Pounds 21,000 dividend
on the cumulative convertible preference shares is being passed.

   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
KERRY GROUP, the west of Ireland-based meat, dairy and food ingredients
company, achieved a 28 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to IPounds 13.6m
(Pounds 12.8m) for the six months to June 30.
Turnover was marginally higher at IPounds 394.4m.
The profits increase was largely due to strong cash flow of IPounds 29m and
lower interest rates in the US, UK and Ireland, where Kerry has a
geographically even spread of business.
One Dublin analyst said the result was 'evidence of the strong cash flow the
company can generate even without any major acquisitions. Currency movements
have masked volume growth in the business, which has gone up by about 4 per
cent.
'The second half result will probably be even better as interest rates drop
further still and volume growth will be better reflected in the figures'.
The group has expanded rapidly over the past five years through
acquisitions, with turnover and pre-tax profits now running at three times
1987 levels.
Acquisitions in the first half of this year have been relatively modest with
new businesses added in Canada, the UK and Ireland.
However, the group said: 'Our strategic plan for further expansion in the US
is taking shape. We are looking at a number of opportunities and we hope to
announce some acquisitions during the second half of the year'.
The tax charge rose from IPounds 950,000 to IPounds 2.5m which the company
said was due to the ending of a number of tax concessions enjoyed in the
past, and the widening geographic spread of the business. 'This will be a
typical charge now going forward from here' the company said.
Earnings per share increased by 15.6 per cent to 7.03p. The interim dividend
is lifted 15 per cent to 0.91p (0.79p).

FT  25 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Bradford &amp; Bingley leaps ahead 51% to
Pounds 58.8m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRADFORD &amp; Bingley, the seventh largest building society, yesterday
disclosed a 51 per cent rise in interim pre-tax profits to Pounds 58.8m,
compared with Pounds 38.9m. The figures confirmed the society's recovery
from a difficult 1992.
Interim results have shown societies achieving higher profits by increasing
the spread between interest charged on mortgages and paid on retail savings
products despite increases in provisions for bad and doubtful debts.
B&amp;B's figures provided further evidence that societies are facing strong
competition from banks and other centralised mortgage lenders, and have
found it difficult to attract retail savings amid falling interest rates.
B&amp;B raised provisions for bad and doubtful debts to Pounds 28.3m (Pounds
25.7m). However, it said that both cases of mortgage arrears and
re-possession of houses from borrowers were down, and full year provisions
would be 'well below' 1992.
Operating profits before bad debt provisions rose by 35 per cent to Pounds
87.1m (Pounds 64.6m). There was a 4.8 per cent rise in mortgage assets to
Pounds 10.6bn (Pounds 10.2bn) and total assets rose by 1.6 per cent to
Pounds 13.3bn (Pounds 13.1bn).
Mr Geoffrey Lister, chief executive, said it was 'reassuring' to see profits
being maintained at similar levels to the second half of 1992. The profit
improvement had been achieved despite difficult trading conditions.
The society's tier 1 ratio of core capital to assets rose slightly to 10.5
per cent. Its gross capital rose to 6.6 per cent of assets (5.8 per cent).
Newcastle Building Society announced a rise in pre-tax profits from Pounds
5.98m to Pounds 6.4m in the half year to June 30.
Leeds &amp; Holbeck Building Society showed an increase in pre-tax profits to
Pounds 2.88m (Pounds 2.79m). The society, which is the 17th largest with
assets of Pounds 2.45bn (Pounds 2.29bn), raised provisions to Pounds 9.9m
(Pounds 7.4m).

FT  25 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Wace doubles to Pounds 7m midway - Cost
reductions and favourable exchange rates boost outcome
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A REDUCTION in costs helped the restructured Wace Group, the pre-press and
specialist printing company headed by Mr Frans ten Bos, to more than double
pre-tax profits from Pounds 3.3m to Pounds 7m in the half year to the end of
June 1993.
The result was also boosted by the fall in sterling against the dollar.
Excluding the movement in currency exchange rates, profit before tax and
exceptional items rose by 23 per cent to Pounds 6.8m.
Severance pay accounted for the bulk of a Pounds 3.3m restructuring charge
for which provisions were made at the end of last year.
Net borrowings fell to Pounds 84.3m (Pounds 88.7m) representing gearing of
175 per cent.
Mr Trevor Grice, chief executive, said he was confident of further reducing
debt, but ruled out making any disposals or acquisitions in the short term.
The UK businesses increased trading profit to Pounds 6m (Pounds 4.3m) as the
workforce was slimmed down by 102 people to 2,462.
Mr Grice said he had prevented 'silly things such as businesses competing
against each other to qual-ify for bonuses' and had reduced the number of
print sites.
He warned that there was little sign of a UK economic recovery.
Profits from the US operation fell to Pounds 3.2m (Pounds 3.7m). Mr Grice,
who took over as chief executive last November after the sudden departure of
Mr John Clegg, persuaded the banks not to sell the US businesses.
In spite of a rationalisa-tion, resulting in a 4 per cent reduction in the
workforce to 1,868, two of the businesses, in Phoenix and Dallas, reported
losses of Dollars 1.4m. Mr Grice said there was no sign of a pick up in the
US economy.
Businesses in continental Europe, which Mr Grice described as having
'slumped into recession', reported a small fall in profits to Pounds 2m
(Pounds 2.2m).
Turnover increased to Pounds 165.4m (Pounds 156.5m). The interim dividend
was cut to 1p (2.25p). Earnings per share of 4.1p compared with a restated
loss of 0.2p.
COMMENT
Eliminating costs and refocusing the businesses, particularly in the UK, has
produced a satisfactory result. So far, so good. The real test of Mr Grice's
capability is still to come. If he can rejuvenate the US operations, which
were once lined up for a fire sale, and grow the businesses across both
sides of the Atlantic without the benefits of a restructuring, investors
will have a lot more to thank him for. With forecast annual pre-tax profits
of Pounds 15m, the shares - up 5p to 149p - are fairly priced on a
prospective multiple of 16.

FT  25 AUG 93 / UK Company News: GRE to launch direct insurance operation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GUARDIAN ROYAL Exchange, the composite insurance group, is to launch a new
subsidiary to sell motor and home insurance direct to the public,
underlining the growing popularity of direct telesales operations in the UK
market.
Mr Ray Pierce, a senior financial services executive, is to head up the new
company, which will begin underwriting before the end of the year.
GRE will also continue to sell personal lines policies through brokers, but
Mr John Sinclair, head of the UK operations, said: 'We recognise there is a
growing customer requirement for direct marketing of insurance.'
GRE, which said it had made the decision following 'an extensive study of
the trends in the UK, US and European personal insurance markets', is
following the example of Direct Line, a subsidiary of the Royal Bank of
Scotland, which pioneered telesales of motor insurance in 1985 and has
recently reported impressive profits.
Other direct writers include Churchill, a subsidiary of Switzerland's
Winterthur. Among the six biggest composite companies, Royal Insurance has
the biggest direct writer, The Insurance Service, while two other companies
 -General Accident and Eagle Star - have also established separate direct
writing subsidiaries.
Analysts criticised GRE's delay in responding to the trend, especially in
view of the company's experience in Ireland where its PMPA subsidiary is a
leading direct insurer.
'Everyone is talking about direct writing as if it is something that has
miraculously emerged in the last 12 months,' said Mr Steven Bird, an analyst
with Smith New Court. He expects direct writers to win a growing share of
the home and motor insurance market.
Mr Bird drew attention to the cost advantages enjoyed by the bigger direct
writers. For example, Direct Line has an expense ratio (expenses as a
percentage of premiums) of less than 15 per cent compared to an industry
average of between 25 and 30 per cent.
GRE has not yet decided either the name of the new subsidiary or where it
will be based, postponing either decision until Mr Pierce assumes his
position next month.
As head of Robson Rhodes, Mr Pierce was the first non-accountant to head a
leading accounting firm. Now 47, he was previously chief executive of the
Mortgage Corporation, where he launched Mortgage Corporation Direct.
He has also been a vice-president of American Express Europe.

FT  25 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Mersey Docks improves to Pounds 8.9m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MERSEY Docks and Harbour Company reported pre-tax profits of Pounds
8.86m for the first six months of 1993, an increase of 16 per cent on the
previous Pounds 7.63m.
Turnover rose to Pounds 44.8m (Pounds 42m) despite only a 5 per cent
increase in cargoes to 13.6m tonnes.
The interim dividend goes up to 2.85p (2.5p), payable from earnings per
share of 9.53p (8.12p).
The outcome marks a decade of continuous improvement for the company. The
government, which five years ago wrote off more than Pounds 100m of debts,
is still the biggest shareholder with a 20 per cent stake.
The company, which last week announced it was in negotiations to buy the
Medway ports in south-east England, said yesterday it plans a Pounds 10m
floating stage in the Mersey at Birkenhead.
This would serve the Irish Sea roll on-roll off freight routes, saving ships
more than one hour per trip through not having to pass through locks into
the Liverpool dock system.
In overall markets, grain and animal feedstuffs showed the biggest cargo
increases, rising 25 per cent.
Bulk liquids were up a similar amount and scrap metal rose 17 per cent.
Containers put on 5 per cent in spite of a difficult international trading
climate, particularly on North Atlantic routes.
Mr Trevor Furlong, chief executive, refused to elaborate on the Medway
negotiations because both sides had signed a confidentiality agreement.
However, he stressed the south-east ports would be 'totally complementary'
to Liverpool.
The Medway Ports were privatised last year via a Pounds 29.7m management and
employee buy-out.
Mr Furlong refused to confirm reports he was negotiating at about Pounds
75m, a price which might politically embarrass Mersey Docks' largest
shareholder.

FT  25 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Hungary helps lift Navan
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Navan Resources, the Dublin-based mining company, achieved pre-tax profits
of IPounds 297,000 (Pounds 280,000) in the half year to June 30.
The advance, from IPounds 15,000 for nine months, was on turnover of IPounds
3.1m (IPounds 1.6m) resulting from the six month contribution from the
Hungarian industrial mineral operations acquired on October 1. The directors
hope to acquire an additional mining operation in Hungary, bringing the
number there to five operating mines.

FT  25 AUG 93 / UK Company News: BT gains veto powers over MCI activities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Telecommunications has succeeded in gaining wide-ranging veto powers
over MCI's business activities as part of its deal to buy a 20 per cent
stake in the US long-distance telecommunications operator.
Details released yesterday on the terms of the Dollars 4.3bn (Pounds 2.88bn)
deal, agreed in principle in June, give BT a veto on any purchase by MCI of
a business worth more than 20 per cent of its market capitalisation, and on
any purchase of a non-core business worth more than 5 per cent.
BT has also secured the right to veto the sale of any MCI assets worth more
than 15 per cent of its market value.
Although such restrictions are not uncommon in the US, they reflect BT's
concern at the vulnerability of its investment should MCI wish to change its
strategy, which hitherto has centred on building itself up as a powerful
long-distance and overseas competitor to AT&amp;T in the telecommunications
business.

FT  25 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Wates declines to Pounds 860,000
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WATES CITY of London Properties, all of whose properties but one fall within
the core of the City, suffered a sharp decline in profits in the six months
to June 30 and passed its interim dividend.
Pre-tax profits fell to Pounds 860,000 compared with Pounds 3.74m, in large
part because net rental income was Pounds 1.8m lower at Pounds 6.12m. Mr
John Nettleton, finance director, explained this was primarily a result of
the sale at the end of 1992 of 1-6 Milk Street for Pounds 9.35m and 20
Cannon Street for Pounds 14.2m. These two investment properties, he said,
were 'over-rented and old (about 20 years)'.
Some time ago Wates decided to concentrate on new developments in the form
of joint ventures, Mr Nettleton said, and to this end, Pounds 23m of the
proceeds was channelled into the joint ventures and not to pay off debt,
which stood at Pounds 95m at the period-end.
This has since been reduced by Pounds 12m, almost all of the sale price for
Bolsa House, Cheapside, which Wates sold to Tesco earlier this month for
Pounds 12.7m, almost 30 per cent above the 1992 year-end valuation. Mr
Nettleton said this had excited analysts seeking the seeds of the next
property boom. He said that Wates had been weathering the storm for three
years now and that he felt some confidence was seeping back into the
property market.
Administrative expenses fell to Pounds 1.02m (Pounds 1.37m) and management
fees received swelled to Pounds 831,000 (Pounds 175,000). Interest payable
rose to Pounds 4.66m, though last time's Pounds 3.25m had Pounds 1.2m of
capitalised interest stripped out.
Earnings declined to 0.44p (1.95p) per share, and Mr Nettleton said the
dividend was omitted (0.77p), because of a deficit of about Pounds 20m in
the revenue reserve.

FT  25 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Medeva's Pounds 13m meets forecasts -
Chairman moves to allay fears over FDA warning to US offshoot
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR BERNARD Taylor, chairman of Medeva, the pharmaceuticals company which saw
its share price halve after a profits warning a month ago, yesterday sought
to convince investors that its problems had been contained.
However, Mr Taylor was unable to say when or if the US Food and Drug
Administration would declare that Medeva's MD Pharmaceuticals subsidiary in
California had adequately dealt with manufacturing shortcomings.
The FDA's warning letter to Medeva, more than the news of inflated sales at
another Californian subsidiary, IMS, caused shareholders to sell their
holdings.
Announcing pre-tax profits of Pounds 13m (Pounds 14.1m) for the half year to
June 30 - in line with the amended forecasts - Mr Taylor said Medeva was
unlikely to get a clear statement from the FDA.
'The work we have done (at MD) is as much as we could humanly have done,' he
said. He said the FDA never gave a 'stamp of approval' after checking
whether a company had rectified shortcomings in manufacturing practice.
'At a point in time they will advise us or government purchasers that MD is
now cleared for new contracts,' he said. In Medeva's last full year MD
contributed nearly 40 per cent of group profits.
Medeva's first half profits came on sales of Pounds 80.1m, up 39 per cent.
Earnings fell 18 per cent to 3.76p but the interim dividend is lifted 20 per
cent to 0.9p.
The company said it was still comfortable with a revised full year profits
forecast of between Pounds 42m and Pounds 47m.
Analysts said Medeva's presentation yesterday appeared to allay some of
their fears. A number said, however, that the share price could take some
time to recover. It would not come before confidence was restored in
management's ability to deliver the forecast full-year profit. The shadow of
the FDA would also be likely to hang over the share price.
Other analysts said Medeva had been oversold.
Mr Taylor confirmed that his chairman and chief executive roles would be
split. Mr Ian Gowrie-Smith, the founder and managing director who has never
had a line management function, would continue to lead the team executing
Medeva's acquisitions.
'There will have to be a different ratio of major to minor acquisitions,' Mr
Taylor said. Large purchases would not be possible with the share price at
its current level but the group would still make bolt-on and product
portfolio acquisitions.

FT  25 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Standard Chartered legal action re-started
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STANDARD CHARTERED, the UK-based international banking group, yesterday
disclosed that a legal action against it by a Malaysian businessman had been
re-started in the high court in Singapore after it was dismissed by
Malaysian courts.
Standard said the proceedings against it had been re-started by Monsia
Investments, which is controlled by Mr Yap Yong Seong. The Pounds 98m claim
relates to assets sold by the bank after Mr Yap's company allegedly
defaulted on a loan.
Standard said the claim, was 'without merit and wholly misconceived'. It
said that it would 'vigorously and confidently' defend the action on the
basis of its legal advice.
Standard said it was continuing to press its own claims in the Malaysian
courts to recover from Mr Yap and his associated companies sums that it was
due.

FT  25 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Bruntcliffe buys Tarmac quarries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRUNTCLIFFE Aggregates is to buy Northern Scottish Quarries from Tarmac for
Pounds 12.5m in its first deal since a trio of industry executives brought
it to the market in the spring.
The company will fund the purchase with bank debt and a placing of 28.6m
shares at 35p apiece, raising Pounds 9.1m net of expenses. About 69 per cent
of the shares will be subject to a shareholder claw-back on the basis of 23
shares for every 20 held. Bruntcliffe's shares were suspended yesterday at
36p pending completion of the deal.
Mr Mike Wallis, chief executive, who used to work for both Tarmac and
Evered, said that Northern Scottish was the sort of company he was looking
for when Bruntcliffe was launched.
Tarmac said it was selling the business as part of its divestment programme
launched in early-1992 to refocus on its core construction and building
material activities. It has now sold 15 companies and raised Pounds 223m
towards its target of Pounds 300m by the end of the year.
Northern Scottish Quarries, which employs 180 people, had a 1992 turnover of
Pounds 11.9m and operating profits of Pounds 1.5m.
Subject to shareholders' approval of the deal, Bruntcliffe will pay Pounds
3m to Tarmac on completion on September 20, and Pounds 7m by the end of the
year. The final Pounds 2.5m will be paid by December 31 1996.
Bruntcliffe owns sand and gravel quarries in Warwickshire and Pennsylvania,
where it also has a coal reprocessing operation. Mr Wallis said turnover of
the present company was between Pounds 3m and Pounds 4m.

FT  25 AUG 93 / Tiphook in loss but directors paid more
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR ROBERT Montague, executive chairman of Tiphook, the container and trailer
rental group, had a pay rise from Pounds 842,000 to Pounds 851,000 in the
financial year to end-April, when the group fell into a net loss of Pounds
66.5m - from a retained profit Pounds 31.7m - following changes to
accounting policies.
Other directors also received higher salaries.
The accounts, published yesterday, show that all the directors' contracts
are subject to three-year notice periods.
Such contracts are increasingly unpopular with institutional investors.
However, the board has already taken a 10 per cent pay cut from the
beginning of the current financial year and will take a further reduction
once a review of salaries by the remuneration committee is completed.
The committee, chaired by Mr Rupert Hambro who last week was confirmed as
non-executive deputy chairman of the company, is also looking at the notice
period in the contracts.
Last week Mr Roger Braidwood resigned as finance director. He received less
than a year's salary in compensation, despite his three-year contract, which
will be shown in next year's accounts.
He is understood to be the director whose salary is shown in the accounts at
between Pounds 545,001 and Pounds 550,000.
Mr Montague holds 3.46m shares in the group, entitling him to dividends
totalling Pounds 668,000 if the proposed final dividend of 14.4p is approved
at the annual meeting.
The accounts include a photograph of the board without Mr Braidwood, which
Tiphook was able to slip in before the final print run.
However, Mr Andrew Chandler, the new finance director, is pictured
separately because a photograph of the board including him had not been
taken.
The accounts also show the results under US accounting principles, which
show a pre-tax loss of Pounds 8.9m compared with a pre-tax loss of Pounds
21.8m on the UK accounting basis.
The group is moving to reporting in dollars, with quarterly results and
monthly sales figures, to meet the needs of its US investors, an increasing
proportion of the total.

FT  25 AUG 93 / ABB seeks to win more projects by reshaping board
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ZURICH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ABB Asea Brown Boveri, the world's largest power engineering group, is
restructuring its executive board to strengthen its competitiveness in bids
for complex turnkey projects. The move will also help it adapt to the
emergence of large regional trading blocks.
The board is being cut from 12 to eight, and the group's six operating
divisions folded into four. Three directors will have regional
responsibilities for the Americas, Europe and Asia.
Mr Percy Barnevik, chief executive, said large plant projects account for
about a quarter of the group's Dollars 32bn (Pounds 21.4bn) annual turnover.
The creation of regional directors reflected the emergence of increasing
trade within large blocks and less trading between them. Mr Barnevik found
the trend regrettable, but said: 'If you want to be a global player, you
have to have a major presence in each.'
Mr Alexis Fries, the new regional director for Asia, will be based in Hong
Kong; Mr Gerhard Schulmeyer, director for the Americas, in Stamford,
Connecticut; and Mr Eberhard von Koerber, the European director, at group
headquarters in Zurich.
Until now, the group has had executive directors with responsibility for
Sweden, Switzerland and Germany, the countries in which ABB's main plants
are located.
Mr Barnevik said these directors inevitably sometimes defended their
parochial interests rather than those of the group. This was no longer
appropriate in a group with operations as widespread as ABB's.
Asked if he expected criticism for having only one Swiss on the new board,
Mr Barnevik said: 'I hope we will not have this zero sum game on
nationality. Now people move up here on the basis of qualifications.'
He said the creation of the North American Free Trade Area (NAFTA)
contributed to the management restructuring. It also enabled the group to
accelerate plant rationalisations between Canada and the US.
Easings of trade restrictions within Europe had similar effects.
Mr Barnevik said 15 plants would be closed in Europe and North America in
the next few months as a result of the acceleration programme.

FT  25 AUG 93 / Invesco profits sharply up at Pounds 23m midway
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INVESCO, the UK-based fund management company, reported pre-tax profits of
Pounds 23m for the six months ended June 30, up sharply from Pounds 926,000
the year before, when exceptional charges offset almost all the company's
profits. Profits before exceptional items were Pounds 18.9m, against Pounds
14.7m.
Mr Charles Brady, chairman, said all areas grew except Invesco's UK
institutional fund management businesses. There, the company's business has
been hampered by civil charges filed against it by the Mirror Group Pension
Scheme in connection with assets it formerly managed on behalf of former
Maxwell company employees. That case is due to be heard in January.
He hoped that an out-of-court settlement could be reached. Invesco's
auditors qualified the accounts because of the claims and Mr Brady said he
did not expect the 1993 accounts to be similarly qualified.
Profits were helped by a Pounds 4m gain from the sale of Invesco's holdings
in a reconfigured investment trust formed after the dissolution of its
Drayton Consolidated Investment Trust - an unquoted companies fund which
experienced heavy losses - and the sale of the company's venture capital and
property management businesses.
The interim dividend remains unchanged at 1p per share. Earnings per share
were 7.1p against losses of 1.4p.
Mr Brady said the improved profitability also reflects strong growth in the
company's North American operations where there has been a surge in mutual
funds under management and strong growth in the management of
'money-purchase' pension plans. Development of those businesses has also
prompted a sharp rise in expenses to Pounds 65.3m from Pounds 50.4m. Funds
under management grew to Pounds 43bn (from Pounds 31m). North America
contributed pre-tax profits of Pounds 22.1m (against Pounds 15.6m) while
Europe turned around to a profit of Pounds 2.3m from a loss of Pounds 4.2m.
Mr Norman Riddell, chief executive of the company's European operations,
said it would be at least two years before Invesco's UK institutional
business recovers. The company needed to remain in that business 'because if
you cannot demonstrate your ability in your own market, you cannot convince
people in other markets'.

FT  25 AUG 93 / Evolution helps trusts pass the fitness test: The revival of
a Pounds 20bn investment sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The investment trust industry is enjoying a revival. According to SG
Warburg, the average discount to net assets, the key measure of the sector's
health, recently touched a 20-year low of 8.7 per cent.
In part, this is because of the bull market in equities. Trusts, as
collective funds which invest in shares, are a simple way for investment
institutions and private individuals to move quickly into the stock market.
The investment trust sector, worth Pounds 20bn, has produced an impressive
performance over the past 12 months, as assets have risen and the discounts
have narrowed. Over the year to July 30, the average investment trust
returned growth (including reinvested income) of 66.7 per cent, according to
the Association of Investment Trust Companies. The FT-A Investment Trust
Index reached an all-time high of 1706.89 on August 18.
But to understand why the industry is currently so healthy, one has to go
back to the problems the sector faced in the late 1970s.
It was originally set up as a means of giving the private investor access to
a wide portfolio of shares, but by the 1970s historical accident had caused
trusts' shareholder registers to be dominated by the life insurance
companies and pension funds.
Many of those investment institutions thought it more cost efficient for
them to manage their own portfolios, rather than pay a fee to an investment
trust company to do so. They were thus willing sellers of investment trust
shares. As the price of investment trust shares is set by supply and demand,
this led to the wide discount at which trust shares traded in the late
1970s.
Investment trust managers spent the 1980s attacking the discount problem in
two ways. The first was to bring back the private investor. The second was
to find new ways of persuading institutions to buy the trusts' management
expertise.
Trusts had faced a crucial problem in attracting private investors; as stock
market companies, they were unable to advertise their shares. In 1984,
Foreign &amp; Colonial, one of the leading trust groups, hit upon an ingenious
solution: a savings scheme, which allowed investors to buy small amounts of
shares each month.
From small beginnings (Pounds 89,504 invested in 1984), savings schemes have
grown into an important source of demand for shares, with Pounds 102m
invested in the first half of 1993.
The introduction of Personal Equity Plans also helped attract new investors.
Income and capital gains made within a Pep are free of UK tax. For a brief
period, investment trust new issues were the only way the small investor
could put the full Pounds 6,000 annual Pep allowance into a diversified
portfolio. The tax-free label helped M&amp;G raise Pounds 376m for two new
issues in 1991-92.
The fall in base rates now makes many high-yielding investment trust Peps
look very competitive with building society returns.
The private investor has also been drawn back into the world of trusts by
the revival of the split capital sector. Traditional investment trusts offer
a mixture of income and capital growth. But for tax reasons, many investors
want only one or the other.
In a split capital trust, all the revenue goes to one class of share, while
the capital growth goes elsewhere. A typical split might be income shares
(having a high yield but a modest repayment value), zero coupon shares
(having no yield but offering steady capital growth) and capital shares
(having no yield and offering highly geared capital growth).
Because such shares can be highly tax-efficient (especially when held in a
Pep), there is plenty of demand for split capital trusts shares. Such trusts
often stand at a premium, rather than a discount, to asset value.
The second trick - keeping the interest of the investment trust institutions
 -has been achieved by specialisation. In the 1970s, the sector was
dominated by the generalist trusts, which offered either an international,
or a UK-based, spread of shares. Neither kind offered any added value to the
institutions.
But a trust specialising in, say, Thailand or Korea offers an investment
opportunity which even a large institution might find too costly to pursue
on its own.
Thus, the 1980s saw a ruthless evolutionary process in the sector. Old
generalist trusts, standing at heavy discounts, either disappeared to
predators looking for cheap assets or restructured themselves as
geographical specialists, or split capital funds. New issues tended to be
specialised, rather than generalist.
So is the newly reformed investment trust sector better placed than ever or
has the recent rally been overdone? Some trusts certainly stand at
apparently unsustainable premiums; shares in Templeton Emerging Markets, for
example, trade at a premium of 17.6 per cent. In other words, an investor
has to pay Pounds 117.60 to get Pounds 100 of assets.
Whether the sector discount has moved to a permanently lower level is a more
difficult question. Mr Lewis Aaron, analyst at SG Warburg, does not believe
so. 'Private clients tend to be fickle. If we had a correction in the
market, discounts could well widen,' he says.
Even if demand does not fall, supply could tip the balance. With some trust
shares at a premium, existing managers have taken the opportunity to issue
new shares to soak up demand. Other managers have brought new trusts to the
market. According to SG Warburg, the sector has raised a net Pounds 775m
since the end of September 1992, with more new issues in the pipeline. There
may come a point when the sector overreaches itself.

FT  25 AUG 93 / Abbey and Baring start swaps unit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ABBEY National, in a radical departure from its traditional retail business
base, yesterday announced plans to enter the highly complex and lucrative
derivatives market through a joint venture with Baring Brothers.
The new unit will be a branch of Abbey National Treasury Services, which has
taken an unusually aggressive approach to treasury management, turning in
profits of about Pounds 100m annually. It currently has a balance sheet of
just over Pounds 30bn, compared with Pounds 7bn in 1989, following the
former building society's conversion into a bank. For Barings, the joint
venture provides an opportunity to expand its existing derivatives
operation, which has been held back by the firm's lack of a long-term credit
rating.
Abbey National Baring Derivatives (ABND), which opens next month, will
concentrate on selling interest rate and currency options and swaps to UK
companies and banks.
It will benefit from Abbey National's strong credit ratings, and its capital
base. Abbey National is rated AA by Standard &amp; Poor's, Aa2 by Moody's and AA
by IBCA.
The lucrative Dollars 4,000bn (Pounds 2,600bn) market in over-the-counter
swaps and options is extremely credit-sensitive, as many clients are limited
to dealing with credits rated double-A and above. Consequently, institutions
with strong ratings are at a competitive advantage in the struggle to gain a
foothold in the market.
The joint venture will have a staff of 30, with back office and other
technical support provided by both organisations. The unit will be headed by
Mr Graham Bird, head of risk management at Baring Brothers.
Mr Jonathan Nicolls, assistant treasurer at Abbey National, said there had
been informal talks with a few other banks, but that Abbey had found a
'match of culture' at Baring Brothers. 'We are both pretty risk-averse,' he
said.
Mr Nicolls said that the move into derivatives had some synergies with
Abbey's retail business base, citing fixed-rate mortgages hedged in the
derivatives market and a growing number of retail savings products
structured by using derivative instruments. He added that the bank does not
plan to enter other areas of the international capital markets.
He described the move as part of the group's strategy to 'move up the
manufacturing curve'. For example, Abbey had developed from a life insurance
broker to setting up Abbey National Life in February, following the
acquisition of Scottish Mutual. Abbey has been active in the swaps market
since 1986.
Abbey and Baring officials said the cost of the venture was 'minimal'
against the cost of separately-capitalised units created by Merrill Lynch
and Paribas.

FT  25 AUG 93 / TUC may fine unions that poach workers: Tough penalties
proposed to combat rivalry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ANY TUC trade union poaching members from another union could face heavy
financial penalties under plans aimed at preventing conflict between rivals.
A tough system of fines by the TUC is proposed in a confidential
consultative document sent to union general secretaries. It is designed to
operate after November 30 this year when workers will be given the legal
right to join the union of their choice.
The document calls for a TUC body to be set up to judge poaching cases if
conciliation fails. It would be headed by a legally qualified director
backed by two outside experts and serviced by TUC staff.
The TUC previously suspended or expelled unions refusing to accept rules
covering inter-union relations aimed at preventing competition and ensuring
stability. This is its first suggestion for imposing financial punishments
on defiant unions.
The TUC has always fought any move by the state to inflict financial
penalties on trade unions.
The document says: 'A new system of penalties might be developed based not
on requiring the exclusion of members or on rescinding of agreements but on
financial damages and compensation.'
This would be linked to the loss of income to a union for one or two years.
The document does not specify the amount of such fines.
Other proposed sanctions against a union found guilty of poaching would be
censure by the TUC general council or the annual congress. The TUC would
also refuse to act on any complaint by an offending union until its case had
been resolved.
In a further policy departure, the TUC proposes encouraging trade union
mergers.
Under the new Trade Union Reform and Employment Rights Act, a worker has a
legal right not to be either excluded or expelled from a union unless he or
she fails to satisfy union rules restricting membership to people employed
in a specialised trade, industry or occupation.
The TUC warns in the paper that unions could be dragged 'increasingly into
inter-union skirmishes and wars' if they failed to adapt to the legislation.
'An increase in inter-union conflict would feed the growing hostility to
collective bargaining and recognition among a growing number of employers
and fuel the fashion for arguing the smart thing to do is to get rid of
unions,' it says.
The document explains that under the new law 'a disaffected group of members
will be able to apply for membership of another union and, provided they are
qualified for membership, the other union must accept their application
whether it wishes to or not and must provide representation and services.'
The TUC would, however, still try to stop unions organising recruitment
campaigns among the members of its rivals.

FT  25 AUG 93 / Saddam's regime hit as top diplomats flee to UK
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
TWO senior Iraqi ambassadors yesterday inflicted a propaganda blow upon
President Saddam Hussein by resigning their posts and joining the Iraqi
National Congress, the umbrella opposition group.
The two explained in critical and emotional statements that they had fled to
the UK because of the 'continuous terror campaign' of the Iraqi regime.
Mr Hisham Ibrahim Al-Shawi, a former ambassador to Britain and until
yesterday ambassador to Canada, and Mr Hamed Alwan Al-Jubouri, until last
week ambassador to Tunisia, said they wanted to live in England with their
families, despite possible reprisals.
The Home Office said it had granted the two visitor's visas for a six-month
stay rather than political asylum, but it would comment no further.
Mr Al-Shawi, 62, said the Iraqi regime had 'no other objective but the
maintenance of its tyrannical power, notwithstanding defeat, disgrace and
total ruin'.
Mr Al-Jubouri, 61, accused the regime of dragging the country into two
destructive wars. 'In record time, in what seemed like a frightening
nightmare, it destroyed a once strong and prosperous country, leaving it
morally and financially bankrupt,' he said.
Iraqi analysts suggested that the defections indicated a 'peripheral'
weakening of Saddam Hussein's regime and another sign of the harsh effects
of the sustained economic embargo against Baghdad.
Mr Al-Shawi said he had placed Pounds 240,700 of the Ottawa Embassy's
operational expenses that 'rightly belongs to the Iraqi people' in a secure
trust until after the dictator's downfall.
Both diplomats refused to be drawn on the issues that most concern Middle
East analysts - Saddam's rearmament programme in defiance of United Nations
sanctions and the strength of anti-Saddam opposition within Iraq.
Most analysts regard the pair, though distinguished and long-serving, as out
of Baghdad's inner circle. Neither had been to Iraq for several years and
would not have been privy to the inner workings of the regime.
Their actions underlined disaffection within what remained of the diplomatic
corps which is suffering from cuts in pay and perks because of Iraq's
shortage of hard currency.
There was no official reaction from Baghdad but comments from Mr Quassim
al-Zuhari, an Iraqi diplomat in the Netherlands, underlined the analysts'
views. He rejected any political motives and said the ambassadors 'did not
want to face economic privations at home'.

FT  25 AUG 93 / Mercedes intends to cut further 14,000 jobs next year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
MERCEDES-BENZ, the luxury car and commercial vehicles maker, aims to cut
more than DM1bn (Pounds 394m) from its labour costs by shedding a further
14,000 jobs in Germany next year and reducing employee benefits.
The company, which opened talks about the cuts package with workers'
representatives yesterday, suggested that further steps could be needed, and
warned also that forced redundancies in administration and the bus and
trucks divisions might be unavoidable.
Company-paid benefits for the remaining workforce would in future focus on
health and pension contributions, it said in a statement.
Traditional Christmas and other bonuses would be linked to group
performance, and other payments 'out of keeping with the times' would no
longer be paid.
The proposed workforce cuts follow a reduction of 14,700 in the domestic
payroll in 1992 and the planned loss of a further 7,000 jobs this year.
The threat of possible redundancies, virtually unknown in German industry,
suggests traditional means of cutting jobs - early retirement and natural
wastage - no longer suffice.
The proposed cuts in benefits, which follow similar savings tactics
pioneered recently by Bosch, the leading motor components maker, demonstrate
growing confidence that industry can attack time-honoured perks.
It is common for German paint-shop workers, for example, to be granted extra
paid leave to take annual 'cures' in spa towns, even though working
conditions and health protection have improved dramatically since such
schemes were introduced.
Mercedes, like other German vehicle makers, has discovered that medium-term
savings plans put forward last year are insufficient to counter the impact
of the motor industry slump. Springtime forecasts that the German market
would shrink by 20 per cent and overall European sales by 10 per cent have
been over-optimistic.
While total car sales in western Europe fell 18 per cent in the first seven
months of this year - due partly to a 25 per cent drop in Germany -
deliveries of Mercedes models tumbled by more than 27 per cent.
According to VDA figures, first-half production of light trucks in Germany
fell 34 per cent.
Mr Achim Diekmann, director of Germany's VDA automotive industry
association, said recently 100,000 jobs would have to go by the middle of
1995.

</HEADLINE>

Once again, a prosecution brought by the Serious Fraud Office has collapsed.
In the latest instance, the judge was even moved to question whether the
whole matter might not have been more effectively examined by the regulatory
authorities than the criminal system.
That strikes at the heart of the current problem. The SFO has failed to
manage the investigation of complex fraud in an effective way. Yet even if
some allegations were better pursued through civil actions and the threat of
exclusion from professional bodies, the current self-regulatory
organisations are ill-placed to handle the task. Since the Financial
Services Act has not so far proved equal to the task, the case for wholesale
reform grows stronger.

There is more than one reason to be cautious about Medeva. Management is
taking the right steps to prove that its recent profits warning was an
isolated incident and to satisfy the US Food and Drug Administration that
production facilities are up to scratch. But yesterday's figures show that
Medeva is not immune from the problems afflicting its more established
rivals. Prices paid by big US customers of its IMS subsidiary were lower in
the first half of this year than last. The steady price cuts demanded of all
drugs companies by the NHS will act as a drag on profits growth in the UK.
Competition from cheap generic products held back profits in the first half.
Even if Medeva can finally convince there is no chance of another nasty
shock, these are reasons not to send the shares back to the dizzy multiple
of old.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
McDonnell Douglas almost got to the altar with Taiwan Aerospace Corporation
before being jilted, so it is not beyond the bounds of possibility that
British Aerospace's proposed joint venture could collapse. TAC's previous
failure will doubtless spur officials to great efforts, since a reputation
as an unreliable partner would hardly help Taiwan gain a foothold in
aerospace. Even so, a lack of political consensus could still scupper the
deal.
Failure would not be as heavy a blow to BAe as would have been the case six
months ago. The management has delivered on several other promises. Perhaps
even more importantly BAe has renegotiated its banking lines so that the
previous constraint on the net worth of the group has been removed. That had
curbed the company's ability to rationalise its businesses by limiting the
amount which could be written off from its balance sheet. So while BAe hopes
to use some of the provisions set aside for the regional jet business if the
Taiwan deal succeeds, reorganisation of its missiles and turboprop
operations can go ahead regardless.
Failure would, however, carry a cost. BAe would lose the Pounds 120m which
Taiwan was to have paid into the joint venture, and the company would have
to use between another Pounds 150m and Pounds 200m of the provisions it set
aside to close plant. There would also be a blow to the carefully
constructed credibility of the new management team. That would be
unfortunate, given that many investors are only now being lulled into
forgetting BAe's past.

FT  25 AUG 93 / The Lex Column: Invesco
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The combination of Britannia Arrow and Invesco of the US in 1988 aimed to
create a global fund management business. The ambition remains intact, but
the performance of the shares for most of the intervening years underlines
that a fund manager's franchise is easily tarnished. The company's
mismanagement of Drayton Consolidated investment trust and links with Mr
Robert Maxwell left a sour taste. Litigation relating to the Mirror Group
Newspapers pension fund still looms. Until that issue is resolved -
preferably outside court - winning business from other UK pension funds will
be difficult.
But with investment markets reaching new peaks and the US business making
gains, Invesco's problems in London look like a local difficulty. Sales of
mutual funds to US private investors show no sign of slowing. US
institutions are distant enough from the Maxwell case not to care. The 350
per cent rise in the shares since last September outstrips even the
startling gains seen elsewhere in the sector.
That is not to deny the legacy of past mistakes. Winning institutional
business in continental Europe is proving difficult, and will remain so
until Invesco regains the confidence of institutions closer to home.
Rebuilding the balance sheet means slower dividend growth than might
otherwise be the case. While investors keep faith in the upward momentum of
world stock markets, though, that will not take the shine off Invesco's
shares.

FT  25 AUG 93 / The Lex Column: Abbey's swap shop
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Abbey National's behaviour bears the hallmarks of a one-product company with
surplus capital and a desperate desire to diversify. After its embarrassing
mistakes in estate agency and French commercial lending, it is now teaming
up with Baring Brothers to offer swap business to corporations. That
certainly marks a departure from its retail traditions and the fear must be
that, like other attempts at diversification, it will end in tears. The only
consolation is that Abbey's treasury business has a good track record and
now accounts for over 20 per cent of profits. Abbey does have some swaps
market experience from its active Eurobond borrowing programme.
Yet it is stretching things to claim much synergy between mortgages and the
swap market. The latter makes more sense for Barings, which has quietly
scooped up the twin advantage of access to Abbey's capital and its credit
rating. Abbey prefers to present the venture as little more than an
interesting sideline. Having tested the water, though, the natural
inclination will be to go in deeper. It would not take long before top group
management, which has no experience of the sharp end of the derivatives
market, is out of its depth.
The fate of TSB's attempt to diversify into big ticket commercial lending
may prove instructive. Still nursing its wounds, TSB now again sees its
future in retail business. It paid a heavy price for trying to behave like
Citibank. Abbey would risk a similar fate if it tried to emulate Bankers
Trust.

FT  25 AUG 93 / Leading Article: Taiwan air
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IF THE negotiations between Taiwan and British Aerospace over their proposed
joint venture seem to be dragging, there is room for sympathy. For both
parties, the failure of the deal would have serious implications. BAe would
be harmed both financially and strategically. For the Taiwanese government,
the money is less important than the fact that the deal carries the burden
of an industrial policy which seems to be causing some argument within the
administration itself.
Taiwan's basic problem is familiar enough. After decades of growth and
rising wages, it is no longer a low-wage economy. At the same time, it lacks
the technology to compete at a higher level, for instance with the US or
Japan. Like many other countries, it has identified aerospace as one of the
crucial technologies of the future. Since it has almost embarrassingly large
financial resources, it proposes to buy its aerospace technology wholesale.
The debate revolves around the fact that by comparison with Korea or even
Japan, Taiwan has succeeded mainly through the skills of the small-scale
entrepreneur rather than those of the large-scale planner or corporation.
The other two countries based much of their early success on the art of
picking winners. How far Taiwan can acquire the knack at this late stage is
an open question.
This in turn leads to the next question at issue, which is whether aerospace
is the right horse for Taiwan to back. Full-scale aircraft assembly is rare
both in Japan, which has much more of the relevant technology, and in Korea,
which knows all about giant-scale planning. Taiwan has yet to develop an
independent motor industry, which is in some ways a plausible precursor to
aerospace. Taiwan might perhaps argue that it is a special case.
Historically it was not allowed to buy western military aircraft, and thus
had to start a fighter programme of its own. In the past year US policy has
changed, so that Taiwan now has US fighters and a fledgling domestic
components industry which is looking for new business.
That is one argument for linking up with a full-scale aircraft assembler.
Another is longer term in nature. There is a vast potential market for
short-haul aircraft in the Far East generally and China in particular.
Taiwan has good assembly skills and still relatively inexpensive labour to
marry with BAe's technology. It also has capital for an industry which is
famously cash hungry. If the project did succeed, it could be very rewarding
for both parties. All in all, it is not surprising that the negotiators are
having a few late nights.

As schoolboys, Jones and Smith loathed each other; they never kept in touch.
Jones became a bishop and Smith an admiral. Years later, Jones is standing

Seizing the chance to score an unchristian point, Jones swishes up to his

Smith gives his old adversary a level, naval gaze and replies: 'It's due in

Who is going to replace Andreas Whittam Smith as chief executive of
Newspaper Publishing, parent of The Independent and Independent on Sunday?
There is some urgency to fill the post since the planned financial
restructuring cannot get under way until the new chief executive has had a
chance to see what is required.
The idea was to have someone on board in a month or so, but, as gossip on
Fleet Street has it, this is proving a difficult slot to fill. One senior
newspaper executive, who declined an approach, says that it is not at all
clear where the duties of the new chief executive will begin and end.
The plan is that Whittam Smith, who owns 8 per cent of the business, will
concentrate on editing the Independent and reversing the decline in
circulation. However, he will remain on the board as deputy chairman.
So who will really be in charge of the business - the editor/deputy chairman
or the ceo? And what happens if the new ceo finds that the paper's problems
are so intractable that they demand a change of editor?
Would Whittam Smith dare recommend that the job be offered to someone as
strong-willed as Sunday Times editor Andrew Neil, who has been doing his own
job for a decade and is said to be desperate for a move?
Sounds like headhunters Tyzack are going to have their work cut out if they
are to find the right person.

It was impossible to tell from yesterday's announcements about its new

One unfortunate side-effect of Asil Nadir's sudden flight from British
justice is that it has made the more self-important members of the legal
profession feel it is their duty to call British Airways boss Sir Colin
Marshall as soon as they lose sight of the opposition.
This unfortunate habit was highlighted earlier this week when lawyers for
the defendant in a civil claim arrived at the High Court only to find
lawyers for the plaintiff, wigs and gowns flying, shouting down mobile
phones for the managing director of British Airways.
Next thing they knew the opponents had obtained an order to halt an airborne
BA flight to the Middle East, on the grounds that the defendant was on it.
Luckily for the passengers, BA refused because its jet was well beyond
Frankfurt. And where was the defendant?

No surprise that a debate is under way about the future of French monetary
policy in the wake of the collapse of the European exchange rate mechanism.
But it comes as a shock to learn that it is being led by an ex-King of
France, who has not been heard of for nearly 1,500 years, and Galileo, the
Italian sunspots expert.
Clovis, the first King of France, is the pseudonym of a writer advocating
the surrender of the Balladur government's strong franc policy. Writing last
week in Liberation, the French daily, he condemned the 'Ayatollahs of the
Franc fort' and the 'theologians of the Bank of France' and urged more
expansionary economic measures.
Galileo has a similar view on post-ERM policies. Expounding his views in the
Revue des Deux Mondes, he writes of the 'tragedy of the strong franc' and
blames Balladur and his advisers for the unnecessary pain of their rigid
anti-inflationary policies.
However, help is at hand for the embattled government in the form of one
Jean-Claude le Franc. He has argued in the pages of Le Monde for continued
adherence to policies which have reduced French inflation to just 2 per cent
and raised industrial productivity above most of France's competitors.
Calling on the services of the imaginary and the dead reflects the
sensitivity of the subject among France's officials, politicians and
bankers. But it also reflects a state of shock in the government as it tries
to come to terms with the upheavals in the ERM.
The real problem for Balladur will come when the civil servants and bankers
who are behind the articles drop their disguises and the debate breaks out
of the press. Like Galileo, the government may then be forced to change its
views on the way the world works.

FT  25 AUG 93 / Leading Article: Equal pay for women
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS A bold move for the Equal Opportunities Commission to take the British
government to the European authorities over Britain's alleged failure to
implement an effective equal pay law.
If it wins, the commission, whose members are appointed by the government,
will have scored a decisive victory for its long campaign against what it
sees as half-hearted mechanisms for enforcing the principle of equal pay for
work of equal value, regardless of gender. If it loses, the commission will
suffer a serious, perhaps terminal, loss of influence. There has been talk
in recent years about rationalising the equal opportunities agencies,
possibly bringing together the EOC and the Commission for Racial Equality.
The commission's case is that in spite of the fact that the principle of
equal pay for equal work is enshrined both in the Treaty of Rome and
Britain's Equal Pay Act, it is not working well. Proceedings under the act,
dealt with by industrial tribunals, are complex and lengthy - taking an
average of two and a half years. As a result, there have been only 23
successful claims in almost 10 years. Since 1990, the commission has urged
amendments to the Equal Pay Act without success. The final straw appears to
have been the government's decision to ignore equal pay in its most recent
trade union bill, while abolishing wages councils, which provide, in effect,
a minimum wage in low-paid industries, such as catering, where many women
work.
It is certainly true that the forces driving the narrowing of pay
differentials between British men and women have waned in recent years. In
1970, when the Equal Pay Act was passed, the average hourly female wage was
60 per cent of the male. By 1975, when the act came into force, the ratio
was 75 per cent. Since then, the figure has only crept up to 80 per cent. It
is difficult to be sure how this compares with other EC countries, since
comparative figures are judged to be unreliable.
The other side of the coin, however, is that in the 1980s, women found it
easier than men to get jobs in all advanced economies. This is partly a
result of the shift from the manufacturing to the service sector, but also
in part because many women are prepared to accept part-time or more flexible
working arrangements in return for lower financial rewards. In Britain
during the 1980s, female employment grew at about 2 per cent a year, while
male employment was static. British women may hold down a lot of low-paid
and often part-time jobs, but at least they have got into the workforce. In
1992, 64.5 per cent of British women had jobs, a significantly higher figure
than in Germany, France or Italy, although lower than in Scandinavia or
North America, themselves polar opposites in their approach to labour market
issues.
This suggests a picture more complex than advocates either of extreme
deregulation or tougher laws are inclined to acknowledge, especially at a
time when the whole EC is rightly shifting priorities in favour of job
creation rather than further regulation of labour markets.
It is not clear that the EOC has adequately recognised this context. Nor is
it evident that its most ambitious demand, that individual equal pay awards
should in effect be applied as class actions to groups of employees, is
practical. One long-running British equal pay case involves a claim by a
health service speech therapist (a predominantly female profession) for pay
equality with colleagues who are pharmacists (a predominantly male
occupation). In a highly competitive world, employers are perhaps also
entitled to ask why the process of equalising pay between men and women
should necessarily involve raising the remuneration of the latter.
It is ironic that this confrontation should be occurring just when Mr David
Hunt is establishing himself in the role of employment secretary. Mr Hunt
is, by instinct, more sympathetic to the EOC's starting point than was his
predecessor. He should now seek urgently to persuade the EOC that he is
serious about speeding up tribunal procedures; if he does this, the EOC
should negotiate rather than litigate.

FT  25 AUG 93 / Prolonged pangs of a difficult birth: Martin Wolf asks
whether the gestation of Emu is following the Maastricht timetable, or could
delivery be easier?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN WOLF
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Is the European Community's project for economic and monetary union alive or
did it die with the old exchange rate mechanism?
The achievement of Emu is indeed doubtful, but not because of the change in
the ERM, which is perfectly compatible with a move to Emu. The breakdown in
the ERM matters more because of what it signifies. Ultimately, a move to Emu
requires a political decision to forge a common monetary policy. The
Maastricht treaty did not ensure that this decision would be taken. Events
since then have cast serious doubt on whether the political will to do so
exists.
A monetary union could be forged tomorrow. All that would be needed is for
the central banks of two or more EC member countries to make an open-ended
commitment to support one another's currencies and, by implication, pursue a
joint monetary policy. To the extent that investors would try to convert one
money into another, the quantity of the weaker currency would shrink, while
that of the stronger would grow. But aggregate money supply of the union
would be unaffected. Since a central bank can always create its own currency
without limit, such a union is secure, provided the mutual commitment
remains in force.
The difference between such an arrangement and the ERM is like that between
chalk and cheese. With a limited commitment by the central bank responsible
for the strongest currency, the cost of maintaining the weakest falls
principally on those responsible for the weaker ones. To reinforce their
exchange rates they must increase the cost of speculation, which also raises
the costs on domestic borrowers. Since there is a limit to the monetary
stringency political realities will allow, no narrow-band parity can be
fully credible.
An open-ended mutual commitment is not the only way, in principle, to ensure
the main benefits of monetary union. One alternative would be a 19th-century
gold standard; another would be a currency board, which is an obligation to
convert foreign currency into its domestic equivalent at a fixed price. But
the former was successful because it originated from the use of gold as
domestic money, developed via a commitment to convertibility of paper money
into gold and, above all, flourished when the political commitment to price
stability was unquestioned. As for the latter, it demands a credible
subordination of one country's money to another. That may be plausible for
the Hong Kong dollar vis a vis the US dollar, it is not for the French franc
vis a vis the D-mark.
The EC, in short, cannot be a little bit pregnant with Emu. However
protracted and complex the courtship, participants must achieve
consummation, conception, pregnancy and birth at one specific moment. That
moment need not be indicated in advance. But there must be a decisive shift
from separate monies with separate monetary policies to a single monetary
policy and perhaps a single currency.
The apparent precision of the Maastricht treaty about how this is to happen
is deceptive. In fact the treaty represented a series of awkward, probably
unworkable, compromises: between the ostensible German willingness to accept
the ultimate goal of Emu, if, like Saint Augustine, 'not yet', and the
desire of the French to move as quickly as possible; between the need for
universal participation and German suspicion of some participants, such as
Italy; and between the desire to eliminate the Bundesbank's hegemony and its
determination to preserve it as long as possible.
To put off the evil day, while weeding out those deemed unworthy, the
Germans insisted on tough convergence criteria; to ensure their happy day
would come, the French and Italians obtained what looks like a binding 1999
deadline; to give hope to all who want to join Emu, the convergence criteria
are ambiguous; and to give them still greater hope, the European Council is
to decide whether a country meets the conditions on the basis of a qualified
majority vote. It is difficult to imagine a treaty more conducive to mutual
recrimination.
The transition laid out in the treaty contained three principal elements:
Convergence criteria on inflation, long-term interest rates, fiscal
deficits, public debt and participation in the ERM;
A time-table that is both long - up to six years - and inflexible; and
A leap from the ERM to Emu managed by an untried and as yet non-existent
institution.
The most problematic of these is the first, not merely in light of events,
but even in principle. The convergence criteria neither make much sense in
themselves, nor, at least as important, help Germany to include those it
wants to include and exclude those it wants to exclude. They do not, in
other words, help to solve the fundamental political challenge posed by the
move to Emu.
The criteria in the treaty were that a country shall possess:
A currency that 'shall have respected the normal fluctuation margins
provided for by the ERM of the European Monetary System without severe
tensions for at least the last two years before the examination';
'An average nominal long-term interest rate that does not exceed by more
than 2 percentage point that of, at most, the three best-performing member
states in terms of price stability';
An average rate of inflation that 'does not exceed by more than 1 1/2
percentage points that of, at most, the three best performing member
states'; and
A sustainable government financial position. This is defined, first by
'whether the ratio of the planned or actual government deficit to gross
domestic product exceeds' 3 per cent, 'unless either the ratio has declined
substantially and continuously and reached a level that comes close to' 3
per cent or 'the excess . . . is only exceptional and temporary'; and,
second, by 'whether the ratio of government debt to GDP exceeeds 60 per
cent, 'unless the ratio is sufficiently diminishing and approaching' 60 per
cent 'at a satisfactory pace'.
Is the fate of Europe to hang on such obscurities? Consider just a few of
the problems.
The interest rate criterion is not independent, since it will be met if Emu
itself is credible. Meanwhile, the inflation criterion is merely a relative,
not an absolute, one; and assessment of whether or not it has been achieved
is not to be qualified by economic performance.
Most important, however, are the fiscal tests, the ones being most
comprehensively violated at the moment (see chart). These tests, too, have
only limited logic behind them. Above all, as Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the
Bundesbank president, has realised, they do not differentiate satisfactorily
between countries the Germans might accept inside Emu and those they would
not. If Belgium, for example, were to be included, despite its fiscal policy
failure, how could Spain be excluded, just because it failed some other
test?
These defects in the criteria are a matter of some importance. This is not
because successful passing of the tests is a necessary or sufficient
condition for a workable Emu. On the contrary, some seem irrelevant, even
perverse. The limitation on fiscal deficits in a monetary union with
exiguous fiscal transfers seems particularly inappropriate. Interestingly,
almost the only criterion that might make sense - the limit on fiscal debt -
is the one over which Mr Schlesinger has indicated greatest flexibility. The
explanation for this must be political, since the insolvency of a member
state might indeed imperil the European Central Bank's independence.
The reason the defects matter is rather different. The tests are essentially
an initiation ritual. Applicants for Emu are required to show how committed
to monetary stability they are. The problem is that it may prove impossible
to agree on who will have passed, unless, as now seems rather probable,
everyone is agreed to have failed.
The collapse of the old ERM does not change much directly. On the contrary,
it would almost certainly be easier to meet the ERM criterion with 15 per
cent bands, if these became 'the normal fluctuation margins', than with the
2 1/4 per cent bands, which were deemed normal before. What the collapse of
the ERM shows is that the initiation itself has been too hard. This
undermines mutual trust and shakes the political commitment to Emu.
For this, there have been two reasons. The first is that the institution in
charge of this rite of passage has an incentive to ensure everyone fails.
The second is that German unification has given the Bundesbank the
opportunity, almost the obligation, to pursue policies likely to ensure they
all do. Ironically, German unification was both a spur for the Maastricht
treaty and the main reason why it will not be achieved in the way once
assumed.
Unification disrupted the ERM by giving the anchor country relatively high
inflation, which drove real short-term interest rates to intolerable levels
elsewhere in the ERM. Unification also demanded a short-term real
appreciation of the D-Mark, in order to transfer resources from the current
account surplus into eastern Germany. In a fixed exchange rate regime, the
needed appreciation could only be achieved by higher inflation in Germany
than elsewhere, which, given the Bundesbank's objectives, also imposed a
fierce disinflation on Germany's partner countries. Finally, that pressure
also created the vicious circle of speculation, higher interest rates and
still more speculation which dissolved the old ERM.
What are the alternatives now?
One possibility would be to press on regardless. Participants might hope
that the problem posed by German unification is now slowly passing, as
interest rates fall and the D-Mark depreciates against the dollar, the yen
and even the currencies of other EC member states. It would then be possible
either to move back into narrow bands, however tentatively, or, more
sensibly, to leave the ERM as it is until the move to Emu. Presumably, the
failure to meet the fiscal criteria would be judged with the benevolence
implied by the treaty's ambiguities.
A second option would be to accept that the political will to make this
transition is lacking. Emu entails a high degree of mutual trust. While the
move to Emu could indeed continue more or less as planned, at least on
paper, the political committment to it must be doubted. This is not just a
matter of the difficult passage of the treaty in many member countries,
though that is revealing. Nor is it a question of the lack of enthusiasm of
the Germans, important though that must be. The most significant point is
that the Bundesbank policies which disrupted the ERM were pursued, without
serious internal protest, on the basis of that institution's debatably
extreme view of German monetary and economic developments. Never mind Mr
Kohl's pro-European rhetoric. Never mind Germany's ostensible commitment to
the ambiguous Maastricht treaty. Just look at the reality of German fiscal
and monetary policies.
A third option then would be to force the issue. Those who do trust one
another (if any) could make the needed mutual commitment now. There is
nothing to suggest the decision would be any easier in 1997 or 1999. Worst
of all, if member states just stagger on, pretending to try to achieve these
criteria, the political and economic costs for Europe could prove
prohibitive. Whatever the economic advisability of Emu itself, it must be
senseless to spend six years, perhaps more, subordinating everything to that
aim within a recession-mired, high-unemployment EC economy.
Emu requires the making of an irrevocable decision. The Maastricht treaty
appeared to mean that the decision had already been made. But this was
deceptive. Those countries that could plausibly share a successful Emu - a
far smaller number than the 12, both now and for the foreseeable future -
should either take the leap or shelve the idea. If this marriage is to
happen at all, it should be made now.

FT  25 AUG 93 / Leading Article: Monks, not devils
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LAST TIME China tried to cool an overheating economy, in the late 1980s,
it did so too late, with a heavy hand and evidently without the benefit of
foreign expert advice. The result is history: the economy's hard landing,
political turbulence and the international isolation that followed the 1989
Tiananmen square massacre.
This time, China's economic overlord, Mr Zhu Rongji, is determined to do
things differently. In the last two months, he has moved deftly and rapidly
to combat rising inflation and curb helter-skelter growth by tightening
control over the country's financial system and central bank. His measures
have probably come (just) in time to permit a softer landing. As remarkably,
Mr Zhu is acting in part on the advice of economists from the World Bank and
elsewhere - people whom Communist party bosses would only a few years ago
have dismissed as 'foreign devils'.
The World Bank has, of course, been present in China for many years and has
assisted in Deng Xiaoping's 15-year effort to open up the economy. But the
involvement of foreign advisers in recent months is the clearest possible
indication of Mr Zhu's desire to cool it down without stifling market
reform. Moreover, as the bank points out, the measures he has adopted - a
mixture of old-style administrative commands and more sophisticated
financial fine-tuning - accurately reflect an economy poised between the
distortions of communism and the dynamics of capitalism.
Mr Zhu has a simply gargantuan task in moving further from the former
towards the latter: reforms of foreign trade, the tax system, state-owned
industry and the welfare state all lie ahead. But in attempting to sort out
the financial system first, he has started in the right place. If he
perseveres, he may be able to pull off a trick that eluded his predecessors:
breaking the economy's boom-bust cycle and engineering a steadier path of
growth towards the market.

FT  25 AUG 93 / Private ambitions on public priorities: Mexico's attempts to
attract investment in its infrastructure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Constrained by an acute shortage of public funds and eager to overhaul the
country's deteriorating infrastructure, the Mexican government is inviting
the private sector to buy, build, and finance projects on a scale that few
other governments in the world have envisaged.
Mexico's telephones, motorways, ports, airports, power plants, water
recycling projects and prisons are all now open to private investment. The
government also plans to remove the constitutional block on the private
operation of railways.
For the programme to succeed, the government will have to persuade both
foreign and domestic investors to provide tens of billions of US dollars in
funding. It is keen to press ahead because, without sound infrastructure,
Mexico would find it harder to compete in the world economy, particularly
within the proposed North American Free Trade Area.
But Mexico is only just leaving behind it the problems of excessive debt
which it experienced in the 1980s. As a result, many investors are wary of a
long-term commitment to it.
The investment envisaged by the government would involve selling off
existing state-owned companies and persuading the private sector to build
and pay for new projects. The government's current plans would build on
reforms initiated three years ago when it sold Telefonos de Mexico (Telmex),
the telephone monopoly, for Dollars 5.8bn (Pounds 3.94bn). The deal required
Telmex to invest about Dollars 14bn over five years modernising one of the
world's most inefficient telephone companies.
Since then, banks and construction companies have been awarded concessions
to build about 4,000km of toll roads, costing more than Dollars 10bn. Next
month, bidding begins for Mexico's first private electricity generating
plant. Later this year, or early in 1994, ports and some airports are
scheduled to go on sale.
Mr Bill Reinhardt, editor of the US newsletter Public Works Financing says
Mexico has 'the world's most ambitious privately-financed infrastructure
programme.' He adds: 'While most governments talk about this stuff, few want
to give up the monopoly power. Mexico is one of the exceptions.'
The impetus has been the poor state of Mexico's basic communications and
other amenities. In the 1980s, after Mexico defaulted on its foreign debt
and inflation hit triple digits, real public spending on infrastructure fell
by an average 9 per cent a year, or more than 50 per cent in a decade. The
effects are evident. In parts of the country it can take a year to get a
telephone. Many trunk roads are riddled with pot-holes. And poor water
supply in the arid north has curbed industrial expansion.
In spite of recent improvements in Mexico's economy, including a fall in
inflation to single figures, President Carlos Salinas has made economic
stabilisation and debt repayment, rather than public investment, the
government's priorities. The government ran a budget surplus last year, and
is currently running another, indicating the squeeze on public funds
continues.
While the government is convinced of the desirability of private involvement
in infrastructure investment, there have, however, been difficulties. Some
toll motorways have run into financial trouble, as construction costs have
soared and traffic flows have been lower than expected. The Dollars 1.7bn
road linking Mexico City to Acapulco is a case in point. It cost twice as
much as originally projected. Many construction companies involved have been
unable to sell off their equity in it and other roads they have built. And
the banks involved have been left with about Dollars 1bn of under-performing
debt tied to motorways.
The main cause of difficulties is the high cost of capital in Mexico.
Moreover, many low-paid Mexicans cannot afford to use the privatised
facilities, such as roads, which affects turnover and, with it,
profitability.
With interest rates highly volatile, but averaging about 7-8 per cent in
real terms in recent months, investors are willing to lock in capital for
only five to 10 years. This has meant they have sought to recoup their
capital quickly by setting high motorway tolls - at about 13 cents a
kilometre, five times higher than in the US. This has made the roads too
expensive for most Mexican truck and car drivers.
In an attempt to spread capital costs over a longer period, a category of
Mexican infrastructure bond has been introduced. The hope is that, as the
economy stabilises, demand for these longer-term bonds will increase.
'Mexicans are not used to thinking about the long-term. But once the economy
stabilises, then you can go to long-term financing. We are almost there,'
argues Jacques Rogozinski, head of Banobras, the state development bank.
In the hope of stimulating a market in private sector financing of roads,
the government is to approach international financial markets next month
with an offer of Dollars 600m in long-term bonds backed by the state-owned
Mexico City-Cuernavaca toll road.
These bonds, 'could constitute a multi-billion dollar market in a couple of
years, given Mexico's infrastructure needs', suggests Christopher Lee,
finance director at Tribasa, Mexico's second-largest construction company.
Wall Street investors, however, are not so confident. Fears of a peso
devaluation, or an abrupt change in Mexican economic policy when President
Salinas steps down next year, make many institutional investors nervous
about committing themselves to Mexico. For example, a toll road bond
launched last year, and secured on a road between Mexico City and Toluca,
attracted little international interest, and about half were unsold
initially.
'There is still a large amount of economic and political uncertainty in
Mexico and investors are wary,' says Mr Ron Perry, of Public Financial
Management, a consultancy in San Francisco. Infrastructure bonds generally
face more hurdles than corporate bonds, he argues, since the foreign
currency revenues of an infrastructure project can be hard to predict, are
sensitive to exchange rate devaluation, and susceptible to price controls or
appropriation.
Mr Lee says the development of a long-term market for Mexican bonds depends
on Mexican foreign debt being promoted from 'junk' to 'investment' grade
status by one of the main rating agencies, opening up Mexican paper to many
US institutions. Both Standard &amp; Poor's and Moody's rate Mexican foreign
debt at the equivalent of BB+, one level below 'investment' grade.
Until Mexico gains access to long-term debt markets for project finance,
bank loans or direct investment may prove the only alternative to bond
financing. For now, the government is looking to foreign power companies to
foot the bill directly for the planned construction of 40 electricity power
plants, each with an output of 350 megawatts, regarded by ministers as
necessary to meet future energy demands.
Even if the Dollars 18bn needed for these plants is forthcoming, investors
are likely to stay clear of Mexico's poorest regions, which are in greatest
need of improved roads and water supply systems but whose residents have
little money to pay expensive tolls or user fees.
After failing to convince any banks to finance a motorway linking one of
Mexico's poorest states, Oaxaca, with the capital, the government recently
agreed to pay for the Dollars 600m motorway, ironically with proceeds from
the recent sale of state-owned television stations.
The Oaxaca project highlighted the difficulties of extending the
government's free-market principles in the face of Mexico's widespread
poverty and inexperience in long-term financing. It also shows that
privatisation may not be the straightforward and trouble-free solution to a
crumbling infrastructure that the government likes to think.

FT  25 AUG 93 / Letters to the Editor: Accountancy needs to emphasise 'true
and fair'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DESMOND GOCH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, It was refreshing to read Roger Davis's argument that accountants and
accounts users are suffering from a surfeit of accounting standards ('Mass
of fine print may obscure judgments', August 19). While the Accounting
Standards Board is busily weaving yet another cat's cradle of rules to cover
every eventuality in the accounting calendar, too few people have been
prepared to stand back to consider if this is really the right road to be
travelling.
I take the view that many of the accounts-related problems of recent years
can be attributed to inadequate standards of accounting and auditing, rather
than to inadequate accounting standards. Mr Davis's plea for a return to an
emphasis on personal judgment and the spirit of 'true and fair' deserves to
have the support of the profession.
Regrettably, the professional bodies are busily engaged elsewhere as they
seek to fulfil the role of the statutory enforcement agency for the new
auditing regulatory regime, which has been thrust on them by a government
that shies away from picking up the bill and the responsibility itself.
Meanwhile, the leading auditing companies are too busy fighting for the top
positions in the league tables that have become the virility symbol of
professional status. This leaves them with little time or inclination to
take a detached view of where company reporting is going. Indeed, they
probably believe that a complex accounting rule book strengthens their claim
to a monopoly of wisdom in this area.

FT  25 AUG 93 / Letters to the Editor: Anti-intervention argument is weak
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JOHN LOVERING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Michael Prowse's main argument against President Bill Clinton's
redistributive budget ('The case against redistribution', August 16) is as
fallacious as it is familiar. Mr Prowse assumes that an individual's pre-tax
income is some sort of personal creation, a gift from God or nature. Only
taxes or benefits represent a 'political intervention'. He can only see
politics at work when it threatens the status quo, not when it preserves it.
Instead of lauding the rich for shouldering such a large share of the US tax
burden, Mr Prowse might consider why they are rich in the first place. Also,
he ought to ask why it is that one of the hardest and most important jobs in
society, bringing up children, is done by people who are among the poorest.
The fact is that incomes from employment - not to mention earnings from
property - are profoundly shaped by inequalities in power. Few, even of the
most liberal economists, would pretend that economic theory can even begin
to explain it. Supply and demand schedules rest on social inequalities. The
truth is that politics is already inscribed in the so-called 'initial'
distribution of income.
Income is indeed a 'distribution' and the unfashionable cake metaphor is not
completely inappropriate. Governments cannot but be implicated in the way
the cake is divided. Employment legislation (or the lack of it) underwrites
the way a few select among the many. Education and welfare policies allocate
access to the game. Property rights guarantee the power to receive income
from others long after you have ceased to do any work. Governments are
already there, ratifying the way the market is rigged one way or another.
All that Mr Prowse really has to say is that they should do it his way,
favouring those who are already lucky (scribbling apologias, I imagine, is
quite nicely paid).
To question the distribution of income and to try to tinker with it is,
apparently, to commit the archaic sin of plotting a bit of 'social
engineering'. But there is an awful lot of engineering going on all the
time. Mr Prowse's inability to see this, and his delirious idea that
politics lives in some separate domain inhabited by unreasonable types, is
pure ideology. There is a lot of it about.

FT  25 AUG 93 / Letters to the Editor: Effects of options on price trends
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr MARTIN THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Christopher Green's letter questions the effects of options on the
copper market ('Options rise can stabilise copper market', August 17).
While agreeing with him that options provide a valuable service to the base
metals industries, I would maintain my contention, quoted by Kenneth Gooding
in his article 'Copper market responds to 'rogue' element' (August 13), that
buying and selling by grantors of options can influence the behaviour of the
price in a manner that is indifferent to supply and demand.
By having to buy on a rising market and sell on a falling one in order to
protect themselves, granters of options have always contributed to existing
price trends. The volume of such options-related buying and selling has now
increased to the level at which they can exaggerate such price movements,
thus increasing the market's instability.
Any operator in the market who is in a position to deliberately institute a
significant movement in the price may well find his efforts powerfully, if
involuntarily, reinforced by the many granters of options who have no
alternative but to follow suit.
Needless to say, these conditions are not unique to the copper market.
