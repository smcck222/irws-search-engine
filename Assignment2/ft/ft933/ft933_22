FT  23 AUG 93 / Accounting rule adopted early
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOST BIG UK companies have adopted FRS3, a new accounting standard that
virtually abolishes the extraordinary item, according to a survey by
accountants Coopers &amp; Lybrand.
The survey found that 69 per cent of the UK's biggest companies adopted the
new standard before it became compulsory, which was for the financial year
ending in June. Coopers &amp; Lybrand believed that early adoption of FRS3 was
less common among small companies.
The extraordinary item, a means of accounting for unusual gains or losses
which the new standard seeks to eradicate for all but the rarest events, had
not been used by any of the companies surveyed.
Coopers &amp; Lybrand believed that this strong lead by large companies would
make it very hard for any company to continue to use the extraordinary item.
The survey found that 43 per cent of companies disclosed additional
information about earnings per share, partly to counter the extra volatility
of the earnings per share figure that arises from the abolition of
extraordinary items.
In 24 out of 30 cases the alternative earnings per share figure was higher
than the earnings per share figure calculated under FRS3. The average
increase was 57 per cent.
Coopers &amp; Lybrand surveyed 111 large companies with year ends between
September 1992 and March 1993.

FT  23 AUG 93 / Sheehy 'could lead to political policing'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SHEEHY proposals for police reform could lead to a 'politically
influenced' service, a meeting of police organisations warned yesterday.
More than 20 officers from eight groups - the English and Scottish chief
constables, the two bodies covering the RUC, the English and Scottish
superintendents' bodies and the police federations for England and Scotland
 -issued a carefully worded communique after weekend talks at Drymen, near
Glasgow, reflecting differences among the bodies over how far they should be
seen to be publicly attacking the proposals.
The three Scottish police bodies have openly attacked the Sheehy reforms,
which include proposals to put new recruits on fixed-term contracts and
cutting some senior ranks. But there is less unanimity in England,
especially among the chief constables.
The communique warns: 'Such far-reaching constitutional change could
ultimately work to the detriment of the public by changing the service from
an independent, impartial and accountable organisation into a politically
influenced and potentially partisan service with a diminished discretionary
role.'

The Sun, owned by Mr Rupert Murdoch's News International media group, said
last night that its sales had risen 2.7 per cent year-on-year in July, which

The move by The Sun sparked a tabloid price war last month with the Daily

THE 60 staff at London's RiverBus company will be told their fate today.
Robson Rhodes, the accountancy firm, was at the company yesterday preparing
to take over as liquidators.
Mr Michael Davies, business manager, confirmed that services had been
terminated and that no purchaser of the business was in prospect.
RiverBus, which operated over 10 miles of the Thames between Chelsea, the
City, Docklands and Greenwich, ran its last service on Friday. It has been
in jeopardy since Olympia &amp; York, the Canary Wharf developer which was its

FT  23 AUG 93 / Travellers snap up holiday bargains
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TOUR OPERATOR Thomson and Lunn Poly, the travel agency chain it owns,
reported a strong response to discounts and price cuts for the 1994 season
which were announced last week, Andrew Adonis writes.
Thomson claimed to have sold nearly 250,000 summer 1994 holidays, costing
Pounds 80m, within two days of the launch of its brochure.
Lunn Poly said that on Friday and Saturday it sold more than 80,000 holidays
and gave more than Pounds 3m in discounts, its highest volume for a summer
launch.
The summer holiday price war started last week when Thomas Cook announced
discounts of 10 per cent for early bookers. Its move was followed by
Pickfords Travel and Lunn Poly announcing similar discounts. Airtours and
Cosmos said that they were offering free holidays for children and
teenagers.

FT  23 AUG 93 / Private-sector pay 'beating inflation'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FALL in private-sector pay settlements appears to have ended with awards
bottoming out well ahead of the inflation rate, in spite of government hopes
that pay growth would continue to slow, Incomes Data Services says.
In its analysis of wages published today the pay research group says that
nearly two-thirds of private-sector pay deals over the past three months
have been in the range of 2 per cent to 3.9 per cent, compared with less
than half in the previous three months.
The proportion of pay pauses and freezes is declining - none was recorded in
June and only four were recorded last month compared with 35 in January. The
proportion of settlements resulting in freezes fell from 5.3 per cent in the
February-April period to 3.6 per cent in the latest three months.
IDS says in its quarterly executive pay award survey that rises for managers
are also bottoming out, running at an average of just over 3 per cent in the
May to July period, the same as in the previous three months. Nearly 40 per
cent of awards were between 3 per cent and 3.9 per cent.
The median increase in managerial pay awards was slightly under 3 per cent
while managerial salary pauses and freezes fell from 18.8 per cent during
the second quarter of the year to 8.5 per cent for the three months ending
in July.
IDS says: 'This steadying of management awards may indicate that that pay
pressures on companies are easing as a result of improved economic
expectations.'
The IDS analysis of pay awards across the economy shows 'the vast majority'
of private-sector pay deals over the summer were 'well ahead of the rate of
inflation', which was 1.4 per cent last month.
Examples of relatively large settlements include merit rises averaging 4.75
per cent at Scottish Equitable.
In the public sector most workers are settling within the government's 1.5
per cent pay limit, although a few local authorities have awarded higher
rises through performance-related deals. 'It is clear that the government's
1.5 per cent limit is generally sticking,' says IDS.
However, Unison, the biggest public-sector union, is to ballot more than
500,000 white-collar council staff this week over the government's 1.5 per
cent limit.
They include social workers, librarians, planners, as well as those employed
in housing, careers and school administrative offices. They are to be asked
to vote for an initial six days of strike action over a six-week period
starting on October 4.
Mr Alan Jinkinson, Unison's general secretary, said: 'This ballot is about
the right of our members to have their pay determined by free collective
bargaining and not by government diktat.'
Voting will take place between August 26 and September 24 and the result
will be announced on September 27.

FT  23 AUG 93 / Many company returns rejected
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORE THAN 8 per cent of the documents filed to Companies House, the
government's corporate information agency, in the past year were rejected as
inaccurate or incomplete.
The latest Companies House annual report, covering the 12 months to March,
shows that officials sent back 329,000 of the 3.98m documents received from
companies in 1992-93.
Nearly a fifth of the annual accounts that companies are required by law to
file omitted the signature or name on the auditor's report. More than 10 per
cent had no original signature on the balance sheet and more than 30 per
cent failed to list their members, directors or company secretary in their
annual returns.
Companies House only scrutinises returns for this sort of clerical error. It
does not check to see whether the accounting policies are correct or that
the books balance.
The report shows that 85 per cent of companies are filing annual accounts
and returns on time, a sharp increase since Companies House introduced
late-filing penalties last year. Fines generated Pounds 5.7m, which the
agency says it is happy to report as below expectations.
In an indication of the effects of the recession the number of new company
incorporations fell from 112,000 to 109,000 in the year, the lowest level
for more than five years. Those struck off the register increased sharply
from 119,000 to 153,000. That reduced the number of limited companies to
973,000 compared with 1,008,000 a year earlier.
Demands for searches of company information also fell - down 11.3 per cent
from last year - which contributed to the agency's decision to cut
expenditure by Pounds 2.8m. Redundancy and early retirement cost Pounds 1.5m
and it reported a deficit of Pounds 2.4m for the year.
Turnover from fees and charges was Pounds 49.1m, of which Pounds 17m was
remitted to the Department of Trade and Industry to cover the unexpectedly
high costs of company investigations, and for developing company law.
It wrote off Pounds 2.1m for the development of projects including a
computerised register of mortgages. This might not proceed, since demand is
less certain than expected.
Mr David Durham, chief executive, acknowledges in the report that the
possible privatisation of part of Companies House, announced last year,
created 'an atmosphere of uncertainty' for staff.

FT  23 AUG 93 / Union links with Tories urged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR DAVID HUNT, the employment secretary, has appealed to the trade unions to
cut their exclusive links with Labour in favour of more formal contact with
all the main political parties, including the Conservatives.
Mr Hunt said: 'The unions have had a very poor return on the money they have
invested in the Labour party and now they are getting cold-shouldered.
'If the trade union movement really means business it should detach itself
from the Labour party and should set up links with the Conservatives and all
main political parties.'
Mr Hunt, who had a close working relationship with the Welsh TUC when he was
Welsh secretary, stressed that 'my door is always open' to Mr John Monks,
who takes over as TUC general secretary next month.
He said: 'The trade union movement now has an unrivalled opportunity to
build a more positive and constructive dialogue with employers and the
government.'
Union leaders will be suspicious of Mr Hunt's overtures, especially as his
predecessor Mrs Gillian Shephard sounded equally positive but then passed
what the unions regard as another round of repressive employment
legislation.
Mr Hunt does not rule out further legislation but said that after
consultation with unions and employers 'the message coming across is that
there should be a time for reflection and consoli-dation'.
Union leaders will be reassured by that. They have also expressed interest
in Mr Hunt's recent statements supporting a world social charter and a
national consensus on tackling long-term unemployment.
On unemployment he said: 'There is undoubtedly more that can be done to
reduce the barriers to people returning to work - but such action does have
a price.'
Following a recent trip to America he said he was particularly interested in
the practice of 'mentoring' by which companies adopted long-term unemployed
people.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
GROWING insecurity in the workplace is contributing to problems in the
family and to rising crime rates, Mr John Monks, the general secretary-elect
of the Trades Union Congress, said yesterday.
Mr Monks, who takes over his new job in a fortnight, said on BBC TV's
Breakfast with Frost programme: 'What we've got now is over-mighty employers
 -employers who can do what they like, empowered by the government.'
He added: 'If you are insecure at work, you're insecure in other aspects of
your life as well. My job as the new general secretary of the TUC is
highlighting the links between these things and to put work and relations at
work back at the centre of things.'

FT  23 AUG 93 / Sharp rise in housing association rents
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOUSING association rents for new lettings showed rises of more than 10
times the prevailing rate of inflation with an average increase of 20.8 per
cent in the year to April.
The rise, partly caused by continuing falls in government grants for housing
association developments, means that rents have increased by nearly twice
the rate of inflation in the past five years.
Over the same period the average income of new tenants has fallen behind the
rise in the retail prices index, in spite of a 10 per cent real increase in
average earnings.
The figures, in the National Federation of Housing Associations' quarterly
bulletin, are based on returns from associations responsible for about 95
per cent of lettings in England. Associations manage about 650,000
properties in England. The number is rising as local authority housing
stocks fall and government funding for social housing is channelled through
the associations.
The average rent for lettings in the first quarter of this year was Pounds
43.06 - Pounds 50.17 for new lets and Pounds 36.59 for re-lets.
The average rent for a new three-bedroom property in London and the
south-east was more than Pounds 60 a week. Only in the north and Merseyside
were new lettings for three-bedroom homes available for less than an average
of Pounds 50 a week. Across England, lettings of new housing association
properties on assured tenancies - the most common form of tenure for new
lets - exceeded Pounds 50 a week for the first time.
Mr Charlie Legg, head of the federation's research division, said: 'The
government has been driving up rents by reducing grant rates for developing
new homes on the basis that housing associations will take the strain.'
For the next financial year (1994-95), the Department of the Environment has
set a national average ceiling of 62 per cent for its contribution to new
developments. The balance must come mainly from private loans.
Two years ago the government funding ceiling was set at more than 70 per
cent. It is set to reduce further, to 55 per cent by 1995-96.
The federation claimed that by mid-1995 rents would have to rise by a
further 28 per cent in real terms to compensate for the reductions. It said:
'There is no sign yet that the rate of increase is levelling out.'
The average net weekly income of new housing association tenants was Pounds
102.33 for the first quarter of this year - 5.8 per cent higher than a year
earlier. For households with at least one person in work the average was
Pounds 169.54 and for those with no working members, Pounds 79.84.

FT  23 AUG 93 / Conservative rebels predict rail bill defeat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS and KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TORY REBELS claimed yesterday that the government faces an embarrassing
Commons defeat over rail privatisation if British Rail goes ahead with
planned fare increases of up to 16 per cent.
According to leaked Network SouthEast documents British Rail's 'preferred
option' for meeting its expected revenue shortfall is to raise the price of
Travelcards by 16.2 per cent, single tickets by 12 per cent and season
tickets by 7.9 per cent.
The figures are among three alternatives which will go before the BR board
next month.
The leaked documents will stiffen the resolve of Conservative backbench
rebels to force concessions from the government when the privatisation bill
returns to the Commons in the autumn.
Their chance will come when MPs vote on a Lords amendment which would allow
BR to bid against private companies for franchises to operate trains after
privatisation.
The government is determined to reverse the amendment, which was proposed by
Lord Peyton, a former Conservative transport minister.
Downing Street claims the amendment in effect wrecks the bill. A leading
rebel said yesterday, however, that 'a large number' of backbenchers were
willing to defy the government.
He said: 'These are not the wild men who are always voting against the
government, these are loyal Tory MPs who cannot accept what the government
is trying to do.'
Another rebel, Mr Andrew Bowden (Brighton Kemptown), said price rises on the
scale proposed would go down 'like a lead balloon' with his constituents.
'I think it is quite unreasonable for fare increases to be excessive. I
think it's just speculation, but if it did go ahead I would make very strong
protests to the secretary of state,' he said.
Sir Keith Speed (Ashford), said there would be 'a political storm' if the
government approved fare increases of 16 per cent when inflation stood at
just over 1 per cent.
'My constituents have the worst service in Network SouthEast. There is no
way I could see them paying 16 per cent increases in fares,' he said.
Mr Michael Patterson, secretary of the Central Transport Consultative
Committee, the BR watchdog, said passengers 'would prefer a hole in the head
to fare increases of 16 per cent'.
Mr Brian Wilson, Labour's transport spokesman, said the leaked documents
provided evidence that the government would have to abandon privatisation.
'They cannot simply blunder on in the full knowledge that the huge costs
involved in privatising and fragmenting the network are destined to be paid
for by the travelling public,' he said.
Neither the Department of Transport nor British Rail would comment on the
documents, or on reports that rural lines - including those on the Isle of
Wight and between Shrewsbury and Aberystwyth - are set to suffer cuts in
Sunday services.

FT  23 AUG 93 / BR confirms Prideaux is to leave
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH RAIL yesterday confirmed that Mr John Prideaux, chairman of Union
Railways the subsidiary responsible for the Pounds 2.5bn Channel tunnel rail
link, is to leave, Andrew Adonis writes. He is to be replaced by Mr John
Armitt, director of John Laing's civil engineering and international
division.
The decision to change the project's management reflects increasingly
fraught relations at the top of BR in the run-up to privatisation. Ministers
are keen to inject private capital into the Channel project, but no viable
arrangement is thought to be imminent.

FT  23 AUG 93 / Tory MPs back 65 as harmonised pension age
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEARLY two-thirds of Tory MPs believe the state retirement pension age
should be harmonised for men and women at 65, a survey published today says.
The Access Opinion survey of its cross - party panel of 100 MPs found a
significant swing in favour of the move since last year.
However, just 7 per cent of Labour MPs agreed with their Tory colleagues. A
third of Labour MPs wanted harmonisation at 63 and a third said 60. The
remainder either had no opinion or wanted the present differential to
remain.
The Confederation of British Industry recently urged the government to raise
women's retirement age to 65.
It said: 'The present indecision is causing real concern in the business
community. It is time they made up their minds.
'A decision needs to be announced soon with a lengthy phasing-in so that the
position of women currently planning to retire at 60 is fully protected.'
A white paper on pensions policy has already been delayed and is now
expected later this year.
The National Association of Pension Funds has urged the government to make a
speedy decision.

FT  23 AUG 93 / Warning of riots over jail reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PRISON reform movement yesterday forecast jail riots if Mr Michael
Howard, the home secretary, went ahead with plans to make life tougher for
prisoners.
According to leaked Home Office documents, authenticated by the Prison
Service, Mr Howard believes that prisons are 'too comfortable' and
discipline 'too lax'.
The documents, written by Home Office officials, say Mr Howard 'inclines to
the view that prisoners should spend more time working and less time on
activities most people would regard as leisure'.
They add: 'What the home secretary would therefore like . . . is a paper
setting out the ways in which prison might be refocused to become a more
austere experience.'
Mr Howard's proposals outraged prison reformers, who had hoped that
rehabilitation of prisoners would be given a higher priority in line with
the recommendations of Lord Woolf's report on the 1990 riot at Strangeways
prison, Manchester.
Ms Frances Crook, director of the Howard League for Penal Reform, said Mr
Howard was 'building up enormous trouble'. The tougher policy would lead to
riots. She added: 'It may even be the cause of suicides. The Home Office's
own research has shown that poor or spartan regimes are responsible for high
self-injury rates and suicides.'
However, Mr Derek Lewis, director-general of the Prison Service, said the
home secretary remained 'fully committed' to the prison reform policies set
out in the white paper following the Woolf report.
Mr Howard's proposals were fully in line with Lord Woolf's call for
prisoners to take part in more constructive work and training activities. Mr
Lewis said: 'We need, as far as regimes are concerned, to make sure that
time is not simply frittered away.'
Mr Alun Michael, Labour's home affairs spokesman, said the leaking of the
documents reflected Mr Howard's need to give the Conservative conference the
impression he was 'doing something' about law and order.
The number of accused women denied bail should be 'massively' reduced
because only 25 per cent subsequently receive jail sentences, the Prison
Reform Trust said yesterday. Research by the Greater London Bail Information
Scheme showed women were three times as likely to be denied bail as men when
charged with dishonesty and twice as likely for drug charges.

FT  23 AUG 93 / Gould may spark bout of Labour infighting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR BRYAN GOULD, Labour's leading Euro-sceptic, yesterday raised the prospect
of a damaging bout of infighting by threatening to challenge Mrs Margaret
Beckett next year for the party's deputy leadership.
Mr Gould, who was decisively defeated by Mr John Smith in last year's
leadership battle, said there was 'growing unhappiness with the party's
current attitudes and strategy.'
His comments follow a wide-ranging attack on Labour's centrist leadership in
last week's Tribune, the newspaper of Labour's traditional left.
Mr Gould acknowledged that a challenge to Mrs Beckett would not be possible
this year because nominations had closed.
However, he said unease among MPs and party activists 'might become more
focused by this time next year, in which case the possibility of a challenge
could not be ruled out.'
He said: 'We have to do more to persuade people to vote Labour rather than
sitting back and waiting for the Tories to lose support.'
The extent of support for Mr Gould is unclear. Mr Peter Hain, secretary of
the Tribune group of Labour MPs, said backing for 'radical socialist
policies' was growing. He added: 'There is a widespread feeling in the
parliamentary party and at constituency level that people are deeply
disenchanted with the current drift on economic policy.'
However Mr David Blunkett, the shadow health secretary and former campaign
manager for Mr Gould, said that 'divisions based on personalities' risked
diverting the party.

Saudi Arabia's King Fahd has appointed 60 citizens to a consultative
council, which has no real power but offers an unprecedented forum for
public debate in the oil-rich kingdom, AP reports from Riyadh.
The council, known as the Majlis al-Shura, is seen as an important step
toward broadening the government's base by giving the country's 12m people a
formal role in the political process for the first time. But King Fahd's
royal decree, read over state television late Friday, made clear the king
was not diminishing his absolute powers.

Due to the introduction of the Single Market, EC countries are currently
changing to a new system of compiling trade statistics. All trade
figures are seasonally adjusted, except for the Italian series and the
German current account. Imports can be derived by subtracting the
visible trade balance from exports.  Export and import data are
calculated on the FOB (free on board) basis, except for German and
Italian imports which use the CIF method (including carriage, insurance
and freight charges). German data up to and including June 1990, shown
in italics, refer to the former West Germany. The nominal effective
exchange rates are period averages of Bank of England trade-weighted
indices. Data supplied by Datastream and WEFA from national government
and central bank sources.

FT  23 AUG 93 / US follows the EC towards discrimination
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN WOLF
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR MICKEY KANTOR, US trade representative, has hailed the controversial
side-agreements to the North American Free Trade Agreement, announced
earlier this month, as 'historic'. He was right to do so. The revised
agreement covers economies that contain 370m people and generate output
worth Dollars 6,500bn (Pounds 4,360bn). Its inclusion of workers' 'rights'
and the environment marks an important precedent. As significantly, US
acceptance marks a further jump towards discriminatory trade policies.
The US is a latecomer to use of discrimination as a positive tool in trade
policy. The latest Gatt report on EC trade policy* shows who has been the
leader.
EC discrimination starts with community preference, the central element in
its trade policy. As the chart shows, between 1961 and 1991 the 12 current
members of the EC increased their exports to one another from 43 per cent of
total exports to 62 per cent. In the 1980s, the divergence between the
increase in trade within the EC and that with the rest of the world became
particularly marked. Meanwhile, the share of intra-EC trade in world exports
rose from 15 per cent in 1961 to 24 per cent in 1991. Over the same period,
the share of EC exports to third markets in world exports fell from 20 to 15
per cent.
Gatt's first article calls for non-discriminatory treatment, with all
members supposed to benefit from 'most-favoured nation' (MFN) tariffs. In
fact, the EC offers strict MFN treatment only to the US, Japan, Canada,
Australia and New Zealand. The economic weight of these five countries and
limits on the coverage of EC preferential schemes ensure that 60 per cent of
EC external imports do receive mfn tariff treatment. Nevertheless, EC trade
policy is riddled with preferences.
In 1991, for example, preferentially treated imports from members of the
European Free Trade Association accounted for 22.4 per cent of EC external
imports; from Mediterranean countries, they accounted for 7.1 per cent of
its imports; from Lome member countries, they accounted for 3.9 per cent;
and from other developing countries under the generalised system of
preferences, they accounted for 6.2 per cent. Recently completed agreements
with eastern European countries must be added to the list. The EC sits at
the centre of a spider's web of discrimination, discriminating itself and a
source of discrimination in others.
How far is the US going to follow the EC down this road? If it does go much
further, will other leading economic powers - Japan, for example - follow?
Most important of all, does a worldwide embrace of discrimination make
sense?
The main motivation for preferences is political, rather than economic. It
is a questionable policy, however, because every country benefited by a
preference is matched by another which is hurt. But there is also an
economic dimension. Economists ask of preferential trade agreements whether
they create trade or divert it. Another way of making the distinction is to
ask whether preferences are a way of meeting the global competition or of
running away from it.
Judged by their trade and economic performance, EC members are too often
taking in one another's high-cost washing, while failing to sustain their
global competitiveness. The same may also happen to the US. Countries that
would rather trade preferentially than meet global competition may compound
their economic faults thereby, rather than remedy them.
Mr Kantor sees no such dilemma. He claims of Nafta that 'the growth that
will come from creating such a large market enhances our ability to compete
with Japan and the European Community'. This ignores the possibility that
participation in a protected North American market will reduce, not enhance,
US ability to compete globally. Mr Kantor might do better to recall the
fundamental insight of the Gatt's founders: the largest of all possible
markets is the world market.

FT  23 AUG 93 / Is there life after Deng?: Chinese wonder what will follow
leader's demise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CHINA'S ailing paramount leader, Mr Deng Xiaoping, celebrated his 89th
birthday yesterday - out of sight but not out mind for millions of Chinese
who fear his departure from the scene may usher in instability.
While few newspapers referred to his birthday, most continued serialising a
lengthy book about his early life by his daughter, entitled My Father, Deng
Xiaoping. Publishing houses are also churning out millions of copies of
earnest works about his contribution to the country, including a mammoth
tome detailing his thoughts on 'building socialism with Chinese
characeristics'.
People's Daily reported that no fewer than 56 books about Mr Deng's life and
times have been published or are in the works. As the end draws near for
China's supreme leader, his associates are ensuring the historical record is
complete.
Chinese newspapers gave front-page prominence to the exploits of Mr Jiang
Zemin, the Communist party boss, who has himself in recent months commanded
enormous media space, as if party propagandists have heightened preparations
for a transition from one generation of leaders to the next.
Mr Deng's advancing years, the continuing absence of Mr Li Peng, the prime
minister, from active duty with a heart condition, and doubts about the
ability of a collective leadership to impose discipline on the party and the
country in the post-Deng era are adding to nervousness about the future.
Among indications of concern about life after Deng is the fact that rumours
about his deteriorating health, and even death, regularly sweep larger
Chinese cities, where speculation about the future is intense among the
urban elite. Beijing was awash with reports over the weekend that China's
supreme leader had died.
Mr Deng was last seen in public in January in Shanghai. He has made few
appearances in recent years and on each occasion has been frailer.
Worries about his deteriorating health, and uncertainty about the leadership
chosen to succeed him, coincide with an uncertain phase in the country's
economic reforms. Efforts to bring the runaway economy under control are
exposing many problems, including corruption among officials.

FT  23 AUG 93 / South Koreans drive a hard bargain to take the fast train:
GEC Alsthom is leading the field
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BURTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE South Koreans proved they can drive a hard bargain when they selected
the Train a Grande Vitesse (TGV) as the preferred choice for the country's
new high-speed train.
GEC Alsthom, the manufacturer of the TGV, was forced to cut its initial bid
by 35 per cent to Dollars 2.4bn (Pounds 1.6bn) in order to defeat Siemens,
with its newer and more technologically advanced Inter-city Express, and
Mitsubishi's Shinkansen for the prestigious contract.
Seoul knew it was in a strong position in demanding significant concessions
from the competing bidders.
The high-speed rail system, which will go into full operation in 2002 along
the 420km route from Seoul to Pusan and cut travel time to 100 minutes from
about four hours, is the first such network on the Asian mainland.
Consequently, the company that won the contract would improve its chances of
gaining more business in Asia and elsewhere.
'The Korean order is important because it will influence the selection of
contractors for the proposed high-speed train projects in Taiwan and
Canada,' said Mr Ambroise Cariou, director of GEC-Alsthom's Seoul office.
In the longer term, China may also decide to build a high-speed rail
network, while South Korea is likely to extend its system to North Korea and
possibly China and Russia if Korean unification becomes reality.
It was the promise of more orders accruing from the South Korean one that
goaded France to launch an aggressive diplomatic campaign to support GEC
Alsthom's bid.
Several French officials, including Mrs Edith Cresson, the former prime
minister, and Mr Alaine Juppe, the foreign minister, came to Seoul to lobby,
and President Francois Mitterrand is scheduled to arrive in South Korea next
month.
When former South Korean President Roh Tae-woo visited France in 1991, a
special trip on the TGV was arranged for him. The time and energy that the
French devoted to winning the contract impressed the South Koreans.
But Seoul will continue to put pressure on GEC Alsthom for more concessions
as the company enters final contract negotiations with the Ministry of
Transportation.
Officially, GEC Alsthom has only been awarded priority in negotiating the
contract, the implicit threat being that the government could switch its
order to Siemens if GEC Alsthom fails to meet Korean demands on price and
technology transfers. That is unlikely to happen, however, as GEC Alsthom
appears to be accommodating Korean requests.
Half of the TGV contract will be distributed to domestic subcontractors,
which will assemble 44 of the trainsets in South Korea by 2001, while GEC
Alsthom will completely build and supply the first two prototype units by
1997.
Hyundai Precision and Industry, Daewoo Heavy Industry and Hanjin Heavy
Industries, which make both rail and subway rolling stock, have formed a
consortium to participate in the rail project as subcontractors. The
contract also includes a signalling system, valued at Won400bn (Pounds
340m). Potential subcontractors include Samsung Electronic, Hyundai
Electronic and Goldstar Industrial Systems.
The government recently almost doubled the projected cost of the rail
project to Won10,700bn from the 1989 estimate of Won5,840bn because of
increases in wages, material and additional construction work.
It also extended the deadline for construction work, which will total
Won6,700bn, by three years to 2001. Construction planning is being conducted
by Bechtel International of the US and Korea Power Engineering.
The initial segment between Chonan and Taejon in central Korea is being
built by 12 Korean companies, including Halla Construction, Ilsung
Construction and Hyundai Engineering and Construction, and will be completed
by 1997. The rail line will be extended to Seoul in 1999 and Pusan in 2001.
As the costs of the project increased, the government demanded that the
train suppliers substantially reduce their bid offers.
GEC Alsthom cut its bid from the initial offer of Dollars 3.7bn made in May
1992 to Dollars 2.4bn last month. The reduction mainly reflected changes in
the exchange rate between the French franc and the US dollar during this
period, according to Mr Cariou. But it also had to trim Dollars 230m this
summer as it engaged in a last-minute bidding war with Siemens.
The tougher financial requirements forced Mitsubishi of Japan, which was
offering the Shinkansen, to drop out of the competition in June.
The project was criticised during last year's presidential election, when
the opposition accused the government of President Roh Tae-woo of using the
rail programme to reward business supporters with contracts.
Mr Kim Young-sam, then the presidential candidate of the ruling party,
persuaded the government to delay selection of the train contractor until
his administration took office to reduce suspicions of bribery and
kickbacks.
The new president, who initially appeared cool to the rail project, is now
eagerly promoting it as a means to stimulate the sluggish economy.
The government predicts the project could boost economic growth by
Won15,300bn and create almost 900,000 jobs.
Few doubt that South Korean needs a high-speed rail system to relieve
traffic congestion, particularly between Seoul and Pusan, the most heavily
travelled route in the country. The south-eastern city of Pusan is the
country's biggest port and second largest urban area.
If the new train system carries 520,000 passengers a day, it would remove
33,000 cars and 8,000 buses from the Seoul-Pusan motorway, which now
supports double the traffic levels of its planned capacity of 48,000
vehicles.
It could also reduce population pressure in Seoul by encouraging people to
move to Chonan and Taejon, which will be within half an hour's commuting
distance of the capital.

FT  23 AUG 93 / Tokyo ready to act on trade surplus
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S new ruling coalition, grateful to Washington for intervening in
currency markets last week to hold back the rise in the yen, is signalling
that it has moved the issue of the country's trade surplus with the west
higher up its political agenda.
Mr Hiroshi Kumagai, minister for international trade and industry in the
seven-party government, said yesterday that a continuing high trade surplus
would be 'one factor leading to the destruction of the world economy'.
A group of visiting US congressmen headed by Mr Sam Gibbons, chairman of the
House ways and means subcommittee on trade, at the weekend pronounced itself
satisfied that the government sworn in two weeks ago was taking the problem
seriously.
Mr Gibbons, a Florida Democrat, expressed the hope that talks on a new
bilateral economic framework, which begin next month, would produce results
by January.
Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the prime minister, is due to give a policy speech to
parliament today covering issues from political reform - his government's
main aim - to how to deal with a prolonged slowdown in the domestic economy.
The coalition pledged on Thursday to deregulate administrative procedures in
order to free up imports.
Although aides were playing down expectations of further initiatives in the
speech, it will be followed by two days of questions in the Diet
(parliament) which may clarify government economic thinking.
It comes as some members of the new cabinet, among them Mr Kumagai, are
stepping up calls for an interest rate cut and a public spending programme
to boost domestic demand.
The appreciation of the yen by some 16 per cent against the dollar this year
has battered Japanese export competitiveness but has also swollen the
bilateral trade surplus in dollar terms. The yen touched a record Y100.40 to
the dollar on Thursday before the US Federal Reserve moved in to buy
dollars, allowing it to close the week at Y104.50 in New York.
The government disavows having struck any deal on the yen and the trade
deficit with the administration of President Bill Clinton, to whom Mr
Hosokawa spoke by phone only hours before the Fed's intervention.

LEFTIST gunmen holding hostage Nicaragua's vice-president and a score of
other political leaders yesterday seized a group of journalists covering the
stand-off, local radio reports said, Reuter reports from Managua.
'The party is over, this is not a picnic,' said the gunmen's leader,
identifying himself as Commando 31 (pictured in negotiations at the weekend
with former Sandinista president Daniel Ortega). 'We are going to harden our
positions.'
The gunmen, leftist sympathisers of the former ruling Sandinista party, took
hostage Vice-President Virgilio Godoy and other National Opposition Union
leaders on Friday night in response to an earlier kidnapping of government
officials and Sandinista politicians by a group of Contra guerrillas in
northern Nicaragua.
Commando 31 said yesterday after releasing 14 of about 35 hostages that no
more would be freed until the Contras reciprocated. The Contras have ruled
this out, insisting President Violeta Chamorro sack General Humberto Ortega,
army chief and brother of Daniel Ortega.

FT  23 AUG 93 / Peering through Microsoft windows: Probe by the Justice
Department may distract computer software giant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE US Justice Department's decision to pursue an anti-trust investigation
of Microsoft makes it increasingly likely that the world's largest computer
software company will face charges of illegal anti-competitive business
practices.
Justice officials disclosed on Friday they had initiated an inquiry after a
preliminary review of evidence gathered by the Federal Trade Commission in
its three-year anti-trust probe of the company.
Simultaneously, the FTC said it had voted to close its investigation of
Microsoft after deadlocking - in February and again in July - on whether to
take action against the company. Mr Donald Clark, FTC secretary, warned the
company that the commission's decision should 'not to be construed as a
determination that a violation may not have occurred'.
'The Justice Department's involvement represents a much more serious threat
to Microsoft than it faced from the FTC,' said Wendy Goldman Rohm, author of
a book soon to be published on Microsoft's anti-trust battle.
The FTC had narrowed its case against Microsoft to issues unlikely to have a
significant financial pact on the company. But the Justice Department is
expected to broaden the case, raising the possibility of tougher sanctions
and even, perhaps, an order to break up the company. Microsoft has denied
any wrongdoing and insists it will be vindicated.
But the case raises serious concerns for the Clinton administration, which
has identified high-tech industries as the 'engine for economic growth'.
Microsoft is a prime example of the enterprise the administration aims to
encourage: a world market leader that has demonstrated US competitiveness.
The company recently reported its 18th consecutive year of growth in
revenues and profits. Over the past five years Microsoft's sales have grown
by an average 46 per cent a year to reach Dollars 3.75bn (Pounds 2.48bn) in
fiscal 1993, ending June 30.
Microsoft dominates the market for personal computer operating systems,
programs that control the basic functions of a PC. Microsoft's MS-DOS is
used on more than 90 per cent of PCs. Microsoft's 'Windows' program, which
provides 'point and click' control for PCs, is also a runaway success with
over 30m copies in use.
Competitors claim Microsoft's success has come at their expense, alleging
the company abuses its dominant role in the PC operating system software
market to exclude or disadvantage competitors.
But a recent study suggests Microsoft has been the driving force behind
software industry growth. The study, by Telecommunications Research Group,
concludes almost 500 companies have been formed in the US to create PC
software to work with Microsoft's Windows, with more than 17,300 jobs
created. Microsoft Windows has created an industry of new companies that
together have annual revenues of about Dollars 280m, and more than Dollars
1.3bn in incremental revenues for established software firms, the study
concludes.
Yet the vast majority of these companies are very small. The typical
software firm employs just six people and generates about Dollars 560,000 in
annual revenues, according to TRG. All are beholden to Microsoft, reknowned
as an aggressive competitor.
Microsoft's role in the industry is frequently compared to the power that
IBM wielded in the computer market of the 1970s and early 1980s. Just as in
its heyday IBM set industry standards, dominated markets and instilled
'fear, uncertainty and doubt' into competitors, so today Microsoft can call
the shots in the PC industry.
Ironically, such comparisons have taken on a new dimension. Just as IBM
battled through 13 years of Justice Department anti-trust investigation,
from 1969 to 1982, so 'Big Green', as Microsoft is nicknamed in the computer
industry, now faces similar scrutiny.
Although the Justice Department ultimately dropped its anti-trust case
against IBM, the investigation had a serious impact which many analysts
believe contributed to its inability to keep pace with changes in the market
and to its current problems.
The government collected 760m documents from IBM during its 13-year
anti-trust investigation. 'IBM's top executives were afraid to put anything
down on paper for fear the government would subpoena the document. Lawyers,
who were developing a stranglehold on the business, decided what could be
said at meetings,' says Mr Paul Carroll in Big Blues, The Unmaking of IBM,
to be published next month.
Microsoft faces a period of intense scrutiny that seems certain to consume
the attention of its senior management. The anti-trust investigation could
prove to be a serious distraction for a company renowned for its tight
focus.
Nothing would please Microsoft's competitors more.
'I've developed a view that being successful is not a fun thing sometimes,'
Mr Bill Gates, chairman and chief executive, said recently. 'There is just a
phenomenon where people don't like a company as successful as ours.'

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRAZIL's National Security Council is to hold an emergency meeting today to
discuss protection of indigenous people after the official death toll for a
recent massacre of Yanomami Indians climbed to 73.
An investigation by the National Indian Agency and federal police found 15
men, 20 women and 38 children from the world's oldest surviving tribe had
been slaughtered by machete- and gun-wielding gold miners in northern Amazon
 -far more than the 17 originally thought.
'The only word for this is genocide,' said a shocked Mr Aristides Junqueira,
attorney general, after visiting the bone-littered site of the massacre.
Discarding doubts over the high numbers of victims, he added 'there is no
way that the number is being exaggerated. . . what I saw there was a scene
of war'.
Mr Mauricio Correa, justice minister, yesterday rejected federal
intervention in the area but admitted fears of further bloodshed between the
miners and Indians.
Under the 1988 constitution Brazil guaranteed the protection of its
estimated 250,000 remaining indigenous people through demarcation of
reserves. Two years ago a reserve the size of Portugal was created for the
10,000 surviving Yanomamis and 25,000 miners expelled from the area. But the
reserve lies on one of the world's richest mineral deposits and local
politicians, business and military are lobbying to overturn the decree.

THE simmering leadership crisis inside the Palestine Liberation Organisation
grew yesterday as a veteran official withdrew from the PLO's executive.
Mr Shafiq al-Hoot, the PLO's representative to Lebanon, is the second
executive committee member in less than a week to protest publicly against
what they say is the authoritarian leadership of Mr Yassir Arafat, PLO
chairman. They also point to the financial crunch within the PLO.
Mr Hoot stopped short of resigning his post but said he would have nothing
to do with the executive committee until the convening of the Palestine
National Council, the Palestinian parliament-in-exile.
He said he could no longer stand by and witness the PLO's 'destruction, the
liquidation of its institutions and the scaring away of its workers'.
He said Mr Arafat was making decisions about peace talks with Israel without
consulting the executive committee and had ignored 'red lines' laid down by
the PNC in 1991.
Although Mr Hoot did not give any specific details of policy disagreements
there is growing suspicion among Palestinians that Mr Arafat is prepared to
make concessions to Israel over control of Israeli-occupied Arab East
Jerusalem.
The latest challenge to Mr Arafat comes amid demands for democratisation of
the PLO and greater consultation about how best to pursue peace talks with
Israel.

</HEADLINE>

   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ALTHOUGH foreign direct investment by small and medium-sized enterprises
(SMEs) remains relatively small in dollar terms, it can bring considerable
benefits to developing countries, according to a UN study published today.
The UN Conference on Trade and Development says SMEs, rather than big
multinationals, tend to transfer technology more suitable for small-scale or
labour-intensive operations. Their investment can bring significant balance
of payments gains.
However, more than 80 per cent of foreign direct investment by smaller
companies goes to industrialised countries, with south and east Asia and
Latin America taking the bulk of investment in developing countries. Unctad
researchers think SMEs may account for about 10 per cent of the total
worldwide flow of foreign direct investment, worth about Dollars 150bn
(Pounds 100bn) in 1992, although they make up perhaps half the world's
37,000 transnationals.
The report, prepared for an international conference in Osaka next month on
foreign direct investment and the role of SMEs, draws on a survey of 735
SMEs, defined as employing fewer than 500 people in the home market. The
study identifies the main incentives for SMEs to locate overseas as growth
prospects in the local foreign market, improved competitiveness (including
use of cheaper labour) and increased exports. More than 90 per cent of
multinational SMEs are exporters.
The most important obstacle to such investment is inadequate information
about international business opportunities, the survey shows.
But SMEs are also put off by the perceived difficulties and risks of
operating in the third world. The single most important action by
governments to attract more foreign direct investment is to establish a
stable macroeconomic environment, Unctad says. Developing countries should
also ensure SMEs take advantage of investment incentives.
Even where financial assistance programmes exist, most SMEs raise investment
finance privately, the report says.
This is due partly to ignorance, partly to fear of bureaucratic entanglement
and partly to the wish of many SMEs to own their foreign affiliates wholly,
while government assistance tends to favour joint ventures and other forms
of partnership.

MOSLEM fundamentalist gunmen have shot dead Mr Kasdi Merbah, the former
Algerian prime minister and military security chief, in an ambush on his
car, the official APS news agency reported, Reuter writes from Algiers.
Mr Merbah, the first Algerian opposition leader to be assassinated by the
gunmen in their campaign of violence against the state, was killed in the
centre of the coastal resort of Bordj el-Bahri late on Saturday when
returning from the beach.
The attack, the most serious on a senior politician since the June 1992
assassination of the head of state, Mr Mohamed Boudiaf, coincided with the
sacking of Mr Abdesselam Belaid, the prime minister, and his replacement by
Mr Redha Malek, the foreign minister
Diplomats said it was clearly the failure of Mr Belaid's economic austerity
policies which led to his dismissal. Political parties, trade unions and
business leaders had all condemned his policies.
Mr Merbah, head of the Algerian Movement for Justice and Development, was
the only member of the opposition to have publicly urged Moslem militants to
lay down their weapons. He published the call in an open letter on July 13.
Algiers radio said his son, brother, a driver and a bodyguard were also
killed in the carefully planned attack on two cars carrying them all.
APS blamed the killing on five 'terrorists', the official term for the
militants who launched their campaign of violence in earnest last year after
Algeria's army-backed leadership scrapped a general election which the
now-banned Islamic Salvation Front was poised to win.
Mr Merbah, who played an active part in the 1965 coup that brought Socialist
leader Houari Boumedienne to power, was head of Algeria's military security
for 17 years.
He was appointed prime minister in November 1988 after riots but was sacked
in 1989. In a row that followed, he quit the ruling National Liberation
Front and set up his own party in opposition.

FT  23 AUG 93 / US rates 'not seen as target for policy': Senior Fed
official plays down speculation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   JACKSON HOLE
</DATELINE>

THE US Federal Reserve does not regard interest rates as a target for
monetary policy, but is putting more emphasis on them as an indicator of
financial conditions, according to a senior Fed official.
'Some focus on interest rates can help to an extent - possibly reducing the
odds of some of the most egregious policy errors - but it is no panacea,'
said Mr Donald Kohn, director of the Fed's monetary affairs division. He was
attending a monetary symposium at Jackson Hole, Wyoming.
In testimony to Congress last month, Mr Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman,
said the central bank would put more emphasis on real interest rates as a
policy guide because traditional relationships between monetary aggregates
and inflation and national income had broken down. He said it was important
to prevent real rates moving too far from the 'equilibrium level' consistent
with sustainable non-inflationary growth.
This prompted speculation in financial markets that the Fed was changing the
way it conducted policy and was adopting interest rate targets in place of a
previous more eclectic policy.
In an apparent effort to discourage such speculation, Mr Kohn emphasised the
'pitfalls involved in too heavy a reliance on interest rate indicators'. He
noted that capital market innovations that had affected the relationship
between money and other economic variables had probably had a similar impact
on their relationship with interest rates.
Targeting real interest rates could not tie down inflation because 'there is
no unique inflation rate' associated with any given equilibrium or natural
interest rate. Measurements of real rates, moreover, were complicated by the
'absence of information on inflation expectations'.
Finally, equilibrium real rates were themselves likely to fluctuate over
time, presenting a moving target for policy makers.
Although the difficulties in using real rates were 'formidable' there was a
'potential significant place for them in policy - not as a target of policy
but as an information variable'.
Mr Kohn's remarks suggested that Mr Greenspan's emphasis on real rates in
last month's testimony was mainly intended to prepare the ground for an
eventual raising of short-term rates.
Most estimates suggest that real rates are about zero at present.

FT  23 AUG 93 / Abiola cancels plans for return to Nigeria
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   LAGOS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CHIEF Moshood Abiola, the winner of Nigeria's annulled presidential
elections who fled the country three weeks ago in fear for his life, has
cancelled plans to return to Lagos today in an attempt to claim the
presidency.
'I have been advised by my supporters to stay away,' Chief Abiola said in
London last night. 'My return at this time would only compound problems.
When the bad wind is blowing the only sensible thing to do is to bow one's
head and let it pass.'
With General Ibrahim Babangida, Nigeria's military ruler, due to relinquish
power on August 27, Chief Abiola's decision to stay in London may deliver a
fatal blow to his ambitions of becoming the country's next leader.
Gen Babangida, who annulled the June 12 presidential poll, is expected to go
ahead with plans to install an interim civilian administration, whose
composition and leadership are not yet known.
Given Gen Babangida's reluctance to name his successor, August 27 is
becoming increasingly irrelevant. Many Nigerians also believe the interim
civilian government will merely be a front for military rule.
Only last week Chief Abiola was planning a triumphant return on August 24,
his 56th birthday. The wealthy businessman said his change of heart did not
make him an exile. 'I will be returning to Nigeria very soon, and by the
grace of God I will be heading my government on August 27, which will be
recognised as Nigeria's legitimate government.'
However, four days from the scheduled transition to democracy, the only
certainty is that Nigeria's next government will not be democratic. Chief
Abiola is taking refuge in Europe and the civilian politicians in Nigeria
are too compromised or fragmented to mount nationwide opposition.
The choice of the proposed interim government lies with the armed forces,
and they have yet to close the deal. Gen Babangida's speech to the national
assembly last week shows that a faction of the military regime is not ready
to give up power.
But there is dissent within the armed forces, some of whom want to limit the
damage which the instability of recent months has done to their reputation.
The sense that Nigeria has no government has affected both the economy and
society. The only commodity in demand is hard currency. The battered naira
is now trading at N39 to the dollar on the black market. It has lost 20 per
cent of its value since the June 12 election.
Consumption has fallen sharply and industrial output has slowed to a crawl.
The labour movement and pro-democracy groups have called their members out
on strike if the military does not relinquish power on August 27. Minority
ethnic groups, anticipating trouble, are leaving the cities for their
homelands.

FT  23 AUG 93 / W European car sales 'to slide': Decline forecast to
outstrip fall which followed first oil crisis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE decline in new car sales in west Europe this year will be steeper than
during the recession following the first oil crisis in the early 1970s,
according to the latest forecast by DRI, the UK-based automotive analysts.
West European new car sales are forecast to fall by 16 per cent this year to
11.3m, from 13.5m in 1992. The outlook for next year is also gloomy, with
sales in the region predicted to rise by only 2.9 per cent to 11.66m, with
the expected further small declines in Germany and Italy offset by modest
increases in demand in the UK, France and Spain.
West European car production is set to fall by 2m vehicles or 15 per cent
this year to 11.4m, from 13.4m in 1992, says the DRI report. Output is
unlikely to regain the 1989 peak of 13.7m until 1996, with the start of
stronger recovery delayed until 1995.
The UK is an exception, however. Output is being boosted by development of
three Japanese car plants established by Nissan, Toyota and Honda. UK car
production is forecast to rise from 1.3m in 1992 to a record 2.1m in 1998.
According to DRI, Toyota is expected in 1996 to add a second model range,
the Toyota Corolla small family car, at its Pounds 700m UK plant. It
forecasts that Toyota car output in the UK will rise from 37,000 units this
year, the first year of production, to 273,000 by the late 1990s.
Mr Tatsuro Toyoda, Toyota president, said in June the group was considering
production of a second model range in the UK.
By 1998 Japanese car production in the UK is expected to reach 800,000 units
a year - accounting for about 37 per cent of British car output and allowing
the UK to move from fifth to third place in the European production league,
ahead of Spain and Italy.
In addition to the steep recession in west Europe, new car sales are falling
in Japan, where the DRI report forecasts a 6 per cent drop this year to
4.19m units, an unprecedented third successive annual decline from the peak
of 5.1m in 1990.
The declining demand in west Europe and Japan means new car sales worldwide
are expected to contract by 3 per cent to 33.02m this year, the second
significant decline in the last three years.
New car sales worldwide totalled 34.05m last year after peaking at 35.01m in
1990. Sales fell by 3.3 per cent in1991.
However, global sales are forecast to recover from these setbacks next year
with a 5.4 per cent rise to 34.8m. Continuing steady growth is expected to
take worldwide new car sales to 41.3m by 1998.
Much of the growth next year is forecast to come from North America, Asia
and east Europe. Car sales are already recovering in North America, with an
increase of 4 per cent to 9.55m this year expected to be followed by a
further rise of 6.1 per cent in 1994.
The strongest growth worldwide is expected to come from outside the leading
car-consuming regions of west Europe, North America and Japan, however.
The DRI forecasts a 21 per cent increase in global car demand from 1992 to
1998, with most growth coming from South Korea, China, Thailand, Latin
America and east Europe.
New car sales in China more than doubled in 1992 to 321,000, from 145,000 in
1991. Sales are expected to triple to 1.05m by 1998.
A similar development is forecast for Thailand, with sales jumping to
540,000 by 1998 from 121,000 last year and 66,000 in 1991.
The Asia/Pacific region (excluding Japan) is also expected to be the main
focus for growth in world car production for the rest of the 1990s.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   PARIS, BERLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRANCE and Germany will this week make a concerted effort to improve their
relations, and maintain the momentum of European monetary union, in spite of
the recent upheaval within the European monetary system.
Informal talks are to be held between Mr Klaus Kinkel, the German foreign
minister, and Mr Alain Juppe, his French counterpart, in Dresden tomorrow,
before Germany's Chancellor Helmut Kohl meets Mr Edouard Balladur, the
French prime minister, in Bonn on Thursday.
The two sides seem certain to discuss ideas to bolster the EMS, and maintain
the timetable towards the ultimate ambition of a single European currency.
Mr Kinkel insisted in a radio interview at the weekend that the new wide
margins for currency fluctuation introduced into the European exchange rate
mechanism would help relations. 'We have achieved a flexibility . . . that
will, I hope, help us to achieve currency union through the EMS,' he said.
France, however, will be looking for reassurance that Germany is not
starting to question the Emu timetable, following Mr Kohl's admission that
the process could slip 'by a year or two'. German officials have since
stressed that he was simply referring to currency union by 1999, the
ultimate goal of the Maastricht treaty, instead of 1997, the first target
date.
Mr Kinkel repeated the suggestion made by Mr Kohl that if the precise
timescale of Emu could not be maintained, 'that would be no tragedy'. He
added, however, that for the time being 'we should plan to keep within the
timetable' agreed within the Maastricht treaty.
The two sides are also likely to discuss their continuing divide over ways
of bringing the negotiations in the Uruguay Round of world trade talks to a
conclusion by the end of the year.
France will also be hoping for signs of an easing of German monetary policy
which would help France reduce interest rates and stimulate its
recession-hit economy. The policy-making council of the Bundesbank meets on
Thursday and a German rate cut would ease bilateral strains.
Mr Kinkel conceded there were differences of opinion and policy over the
Bundesbank's monetary policy, as well as the Uruguay Round, but he believed
these could be overcome.
Germany supports less protectionism for its farm sector, while France,
subject to pressure from a powerful agrarian lobby, is reluctant to sanction
greater liberalisation, which would entail lower subsidies.
The discussions between Mr Juppe and Mr Kinkel will centre on the position
France will take at September's meeting of EC foreign and farm ministers.

FT  23 AUG 93 / Map poses dilemma for Izetbegovic
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA SILBER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BELGRADE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN Bosnia's President Alija Izetbegovic headed for peace talks in Geneva a
month ago, he said: 'We will do everything to reach peace, but also to
preserve the state and the nation.' In the next week he has to decide
whether to back the deal that could offer him peace and lose him the state.
On the table is the map put forward by international mediators which
partitions his republic in an effort to end 17 months of war.
While the peace envoys explained how they tried to wring concessions from
the Serb and Croat sides in order to salvage a viable republic for the
Bosnian Moslems, the compromise map sanctions Serb and Croat military
victory in Bosnia.
In statements remarkable for their similiarity, Serb and Croat leaders
welcomed the proposed plan as a 'compromise which could bring an end to the
war'. They are likely to put their signatures to the Geneva agreement.
But Mr Izetbegovic is faced with a plan that leaves his Bosnian republic
virtually land-locked and geographically disjointed.
Moslems, the biggest ethnic group in Bosnia, will stand slim chance of
preserving their bizarrely shaped republic and national identity sandwiched
between the new Greater Serbia and Greater Croatia.
Serb enthusiasm for the plan appears to reflect this: 'The Turks (a
derogatory term for Bosnia's Moslems) are going to be like walnuts in a
Serbo-Croat nutcracker,' a member of the Bosnian Serb delegation on Friday
night in Geneva gleefully boasted after the proposal was announced.
But if Mr Izetbegovic rejects the proposal next Monday, he risks losing the
already dwindling support of the international community. He and his Bosnian
assembly, which this week will consider the plan, will be seen as opting for
more war over the 'compromise' solution brokered by mediators Lord Owen and
Thorvald Stoltenberg.
In remarks which reveal the intense pressure on Mr Izetbegovic, Serbian
foreign minister Vladislav Jovanovic said yesterday in an interview with
Radio Belgrade that the European Community had threatened Mr Izetbegovic
that western governments would cut off finances for the UN peacekeepers and
humanitarian aid if he rejected the plan.
In addition, if the war continues, the outgunned and exhausted Bosnian army
could be totally defeated. Croats and Serbs in the mostly Moslem republic
may be left without a homeland, forced to take sides amid the dwindling
resources and the collapse of a multi-ethnic Bosnia.
Since the war erupted in April 1992, Mr Izetbegovic has made clear that he
was fighting for the survival of a Bosnian state as well as the Moslem
nation.
But the map fails to restore territory which was mostly Moslem before the
war to Bosnian government control. The three remaining pockets in eastern
Bosnia, proclaimed 'safe areas' by the UN, are joined by a tenuous route.
The road is designated for Moslem control but it runs through Serb-held
Trnovo, which is part of the Sarajevo district.
The temporary solution on Sarajevo freezes current frontlines and the fate
of the Bosnia capital depends on the overall success of the peace
settlement.
Access routes and fly-overs etched on the map to link the mostly Moslem
republic to ports on the northern River Sava and the Adriatic show the state
as unlikely to survive in the hostile climate of the aggressive Balkan
nationalism.
The only real chance for Mr Izetbegovic and his future mostly Moslem Bosnian
republic rests with the international community's will to pour in generous
amounts of aid to pave the way for the gradual re-integration of the
territory into the Balkans and Europe.

FT  23 AUG 93 / German politicians brace for a roller-coaster ride

<TEXT>
THE great beer tent at the fair on Hamburg's Heiligengeistfeld heaved and
shuddered every few minutes as a roller-coaster thundered down its
precipitous track only yards from the tent door. The roar hit the walls of
the tent like the waves of a storm at sea.
But inside, the capacity crowd was impervious to all distractions from the
fun of the fair. They had come for a different and more exclusive
experience.
All attention was fixed on a sober-suited, dapper, white-haired gentleman,
speaking from the platform under a giant portrait of a grinning ox. Here was
a face and a voice from the past.
Mr Helmut Schmidt, former West German chancellor, was back on the bandwagon
for the first time in more than 10 years, throwing his political weight into
an election campaign for his Social Democrats. He was on home ground, in his
native city, back from self-imposed political exile. And they loved it.
Mr Schmidt personifies an image that the SPD is desperate to recapture, only
months before the marathon election year of 1994, with no fewer than 19
local, state, national and European polls: that it is a party 'capable of
government'.
It is a message they need to put across in Hamburg, too, in spite of having
ruled the city council almost uninterruptedly since the war. For the SPD is
in danger of losing its absolute majority in the city-state in an
extraordinary election it is having to fight through no fault of its own.
And all eyes will be on the poll result on September 19 to see clues for
next year's big campaigns.
Yet Mr Schmidt's message was grim enough. 'Above all, get out and vote,' he
urged, 'for the very existence of our republic is at stake.'
Voting for the SPD itself was only his secondary theme. His greatest concern
is that too many will either stay away from the polls or cast a protest vote
against the political establishment, for the extremes of left or right.
'Whoever dares to vote for a fringe party, to throw away his vote on a party
of the far left or right, is making the same mistake many of our parents and
grandparents made in 1931 and 1932, with terrible consequences,' he warned.
'For God's sake, don't give them a single vote, those people who have a
sneaking sympathy for skinhead murder gangs. This coming election year will
be the greatest test yet faced by our generation.'
There is a real fear in Hamburg, in spite of prosperity, that protest voters
and stay-at-homes will undermine all main political parties in the poll.
For a start, the election is a bit of a nonsense. It has been ordered by the
local constitutional court, half way through the life of the current city
council, because the losers last time - Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian
Democratic Union - were found undemocratic in the way they selected their
party candidates. And yet it is the SPD that could lose most in the re-run.
In 1991, the SPD won a wafer-thin absolute majority of one, with 48 per cent
of the vote, against 35 per cent for the CDU. Opinion polls last week put
the SPD on 42 per cent and the CDU down around 34 per cent, with a sharp
increase in support for protest parties such as the Greens and far-right
Republicans.
'The one certain thing is that the SPD will lose its absolute majority,'
says Mr Wolf Brocke, election campaign agent for the CDU. 'There is also a
real danger that a far-right party will gain some seats in the council.'
So far, it looks as if the main beneficiaries of protest votes will be the
Greens, whose support is up from 7.2 per cent to at least 10 per cent. But
the Republicans are bumping just under the 5 per cent barrier which they
must cross to get into the council, and another far-right party, the
Deutsche Volksunion (DVU), is also pushing for support.
Just to complicate the picture, there is a special party for the
disaffected, the so-called Statt Partei - a play on words, meaning it stands
'instead of' the traditional parties - founded and led by Mr Markus Wegner,
the 40-year-old publisher and former CDU member who brought the court case
challenging the last elections. The polls suggest he will only pick up 2 per
cent but nobody really trusts the polls - most are just phone surveys.
Mr Ernst-Ullrich Bottcher, a clerical worker in a Bremen trading house who
heads the Republicans' list of candidates, is confident he will be sitting
in the council chamber next month, with between 6 and 8 per cent of the vote
 -in spite of a very low profile on the city streets. Few voters know his
name and few have seen his posters, but the fear of the majority parties is
an effective advertisement.
Just as the SPD is desperate to prove itself capable of government, the
Republicans are desperate to prove themselves 'house-trained' - capable of
being civilised members of a democratic society. Mr Bottcher bends over
backwards to deny any hint of xenophobia in his campaign.
'I was born in 1948, and no one can accuse me of being a Nazi or a
neo-Nazi,' he says. 'I have four nephews and nieces who are Egyptians, and
four who are Italian.'
There is a chance the right-wing vote will split between the Republicans and
the DVU, leaving neither with the necessary 5 per cent. Indeed, if that
happens and the Free Democratic party also fails to cross the 5 per cent
barrier, the SPD could hang on to power with a vote of around 44 per cent.
But no one really believes it.
Mr Hans-Ulrich Klose, parliamentary leader of the SPD in Bonn and another
son of Hamburg, knows the eyes of the world are on the rise of the right.
'Six or eight per cent would be too much,' he says. 'It might be all right
in France or Italy. It certainly is not in Germany.'
That is Mr Schmidt's message, too. And that seems to be why he has decided
to come back to the political platform and call for a steady hand. 'Anyone
in Hamburg who votes for the far left or the far right will endanger the
republic itself, and the outward-looking tradition of our state,' he said.
'Hamburg is a European metropolis. Our international reputation is at
stake.'

FT  23 AUG 93 / Old ways imperil the new Russia: The vested interests which
hinder reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEYLA BOULTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Sergei Glaziev, Russia's 32-year-old minister for foreign economic
relations, was en route to Africa on Friday when the Kremlin ordered his
aircraft back in mid-flight. Before leaving he had introduced draconian
rules to crack down on corruption in the distribution of lucrative export
quotas.
Before the weekend was out, Mr Glaziev had offered to quit his job, saying
he had been the victim of 'mafia structures' and officials whose corrupt
interests he had threatened.
Mr Glaziev's resignation offer, a day after the resignation of Mr Mikhail
Fedotov, the information minister, is symptomatic of the chaos at the top of
reformist Russia as it seeks to shed its communist past for more democratic
government.
Yesterday morning, soon after Mr Fedotov said he was quitting in protest
against parliament's moves to muzzle the media, gun shots were fired at his
office.
Mr Fedotov says he wants the media to be free of control from the
presidential camp, but can do nothing because television is really
controlled by Mr Mikhail Poltoranin, the presidential aide who is likely to
take his job.
The resignation of two young reformist ministers reflects more than just the
harsh reality of politics around the world. In Russia it marks a struggle
for reform without reformed decision-making.
A chaotic and slow bureaucracy, set at times against the extensive personal
power of President Boris Yeltsin, has become potentially lethal, given the
all-out political war between president and the parliament which Mr Yeltsin
wants to replace with a new bicameral assembly and a modern constitution.
Although bitter at intrigues from within the presidential camp, even Mr
Fedotov said there was no room for compromise with parliament on Mr
Yeltsin's bid to push through new parliamentary elections in the autumn.
'We don't have a parliament. We have a parliamentary party,' he said. 'It
and the presidential party must solve their argument through elections. The
parliament does not want to compromise with the president - it just wants to
do whatever it likes.'
In the interim, though the alternatives presented by parliament are even
less appealing, Mr Yeltsin's powers are clearly open to abuse, sometimes at
the expense of the democratic, market-oriented reforms he says he is
pursuing.
In the case of the relatively junior and expendable Mr Glaziev, if his
resignation is accepted, he will have become a scapegoat for Mr Yeltsin's
need to appear as 'Mr Clean'.
One sympathiser from the reformist wing of the government, who declined to
be identified, said he was convinced Mr Glaziev was honest, even though
officials in his ministry were certainly taking bribes. Until Russia removes
export quotas altogether, foreign trade will remain a breeding-ground for
corruption.
But it is Mr Glaziev, who took the courageous decision to cut the number of
organisations allowed to export strategic commodities, who is being forced
to take the blame for trying to limit the abuses.
In his resignation letter, Mr Glaziev said he had been hounded out of office
by Mr Vladimir Shumeiko, the first deputy prime minister and a key Yeltsin
aide, who is being investigated for corruption at parliament's request.
Previously a political weapon in the struggle between parliamentary and
presidential camps, corruption allegations are now helping to tear apart the
reformists in government.
Radical reformers such as Mr Boris Fyodorov, the finance minister who has
complained of intrigues within the cabinet, have attempted to overcome
inefficiency and abuses by taking as much decision-making as possible out of
state hands.
But Mr Yeltsin's own extensive powers, designed to cut through the
inefficiency, have also proven a liability, given the amount of property and
economic decision-making still controlled by the state.
For instance, the president at the end of last year signed a decree which
led to the 'irrevocable' transfer of a building worth millions of dollars in
the centre of Moscow to a mainly private investment company headed by the
former industry minister.
In later trying to recover the building for other purposes, despite the
terms of the contract saying it could not do so, the State Property
Committee, which is responsible for both privatisation and managing property
still in state hands, violated the very respect for property rights the
economic reforms have tried to promote.

   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Russian government yesterday told Lithuania it would break an agreement
to withdraw former Soviet troops from the Baltic republic by the end of the
month.
Lithuania, which has granted citizenship and the right to vote to most
Russians living on its territory, would have become the first former Soviet
republic to be free of Russian military forces.
A statement issued by the Foreign Ministry claimed the Lithuanians had
obstructed the deal, without giving details. It also warned of retaliation
against Lithuania for any 'provocations' against Russian servicemen.
The quarrel stems from Lithuanian demands for Dollars 143bn (Pounds 96bn) to
cover damages for 50 years of Soviet rule - unrecoverable financially but,
for the Lithuanians, an important admission of occupation by Russia. Russia
refuses to be held responsible, financially or historically, for the Soviet
era.
But the arbitrary and harsh tone of the statement suggested the usually
liberal Russian Foreign Ministry was trying to pander to more conservative
sentiments inside Russia.

FT  23 AUG 93 / Ford warns further losses would hit investment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FORD of Europe will be in loss in 1993 for the third successive year, and
the company has warned that further losses next year would begin to hit its
future investment and product development programmes.
The company has told its workforce that it may have to cut more jobs 'if
conditions in Europe continue to worsen', in addition to the 14,400 jobs it
is already eliminating by the end of this year.
Ford of Europe warned that the industry faced excess capacity of about 7m
units by the mid to late 1990s. At the same time, an industry forecast
released today predicts that west European new car sales will fall by 16 per
cent this year to only 11.3m from 13.5m in 1992.
Mr Jacques Nasser, who was appointed chairman of Ford of Europe late last
year to end two years of losses, has told employees, 'clearly we have not
yet achieved the turnaround we require' despite the 'most radical
restructuring in our 25-year history'.
In a message broadcast to employees on the company's internal television
service, Mr Nasser warned that a failure to return to profitability soon
would start to endanger 'core competencies'.
'This means you start to take out the muscle of the organisation as well as
the fat. If that happens, we will have been forced to limit our capability
of competing.'
Ford's European automotive operations, including Jaguar and excluding
financial services, have suffered total losses of Dollars 2.4bn (Pounds
1.6bn) in the past two years.
In the first half of 1993, losses totalled a further Dollars 257m compared
with a profit of Dollars 107m in the corresponding period a year ago.
The company is already aiming to slash the workforce of its European
automotive operations (excluding Jaguar) by 14.8 per cent to 83,000 by the
end of 1993 from 97,400 last October. The workforce will have been cut by 28
per cent from 115,000 in 1990.
Mr Nasser warned: 'If we cannot improve our financial results both in the
short and medium term, we will not be able to introduce the new products
that we need to maintain or improve our position in Europe's automotive
industry.'
He said that Ford of Europe losses were mounting as a result of:
the 18 per cent fall in new vehicle sales across Europe in the first seven
months;
unfavourable exchange rate movements;
higher marketing costs;
declining market share, with particular losses for the Escort/Orion and the
Fiesta ranges offsetting the gains made by the Mondeo, which was launched
earlier this year.
Ford of Europe is intensifying the squeeze on its components suppliers, and
Mr Nasser said the group was now seeking to cut the costs of purchased
materials by 10 per cent over two years instead of over three years as
before.
He warned that the problem of overcapacity was 'a major strategic concern'
for all carmakers in Europe. Ford did not expect new car sales in west
Europe to return to the trend level of 1990-91 until the late 1990s.
An overcapacity of about 7m units by the end of the 1990s would pose 'severe
structural problems' for the European auto industry, which would be
compounded by a rising market share gained by Japanese carmakers. This 'may
result in continued losses or severely depressed profitability for many
manufacturers'.

FT  23 AUG 93 / Bosnia plan put at risk by flare-up in fighting: Izetbegovic
likely to recommend parliament's rejection of peace proposal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE FUTURE of the Bosnian peace plan appeared to be hanging in the balance
yesterday, with reports of renewed fighting and growing civilian suffering
in Bosnia.
Amid confusion about the proposed role of the United Nations and the
European Community in the peace plan, an EC official yesterday admitted that
the Community had not been fully consulted about the plan's unexpected
suggestion that it should take over administration of the disputed southern
city of Mostar.
Mr Alija Izetbegovic, the Bosnian president, announced that he would call a
meeting of the Bosnian parliament on Friday to discuss the plan, which was
presented to the three sides in Geneva last Friday.
But, speaking in the central city of Zenica, he indicated he would probably
recommend that the assembly reject the plan, in spite of pressure from the
international community to accept the deal - a move likely to exacerbate the
splits in the multi-ethnic Bosnian leadership.
The three sides in the conflict have until next Monday to decide on the
plan, which would give the Moslem-dominated Bosnian government up to 28 per
cent of Bosnia - considerably less than its delegation originally demanded.
Reports of renewed fighting yesterday left all three sides accusing each
other of seeking to grab territory in the run-up to the resumption of talks
next Monday.
Sarajevo radio reported fresh Serb attacks around Brcko, the port designated
under the peace plan for Bosnian access to the River Sava in the north, and
Radio Belgrade reported overnight Moslem attacks near Serb-held Doboj,
northern Bosnia.
An Unprofor spokesman in Zagreb said the UN could not confirm reports of
further fighting in central Bosnia, but confirmed clashes between Croat and
Bosnian forces around Mostar.
Ms Lyndall Sachs, UNHCR spokeswoman in Sarajevo, bitterly criticised the
Croat forces around Mostar for their refusal to let aid convoys into the
city, where up to 50,000 mostly Moslem inhabitants have been trapped in the
east of the city for more than two months with minimal food and water.
Although the UN managed to take a token supply of medicine into Mostar over
the weekend, Ms Sachs yesterday said negotiations between the Spanish
peacekeeping troops and Croat forces about access for food convoys had so
far failed to yield results.
Mostar residents now faced a real danger of starvation, Ms Sachs said. When
the UN vehicle went in there over the weekend it was besieged by people
begging for food. 'Our colleagues have seen people thin and starving there.
It is a desperate situation,' she said.
Meanwhile, amid the signs of growing confusion about the future role of the
UN and EC in any future settlement of Bosnia, the 12 EC member states were
last night locked in consultations on the administration of Mostar.
Foreign ministries of the 12, and the European Commission in Brussels, were
still digesting the idea, EC officials said. 'There is at present not that
much detail on how this would work, or who exactly would deal with it,' said
a spokesman for the Belgian presidency of the EC. 'This idea was floated in
a rather haphazard way and there certainly wasn't any previous consultation
with anybody in the 12.'
But officials are not ruling out a role for the EC in Mostar analogous to
the suggested role for the UN in Sarajevo. EC member states, in most
reckonings, would have to guarantee the military security of Mostar, and
would have to pledge new money to Brussels' now exhausted humanitarian aid
budget.

FT  23 AUG 93 / Government promises tough action on jails and deficit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT yesterday sought to lay the groundwork for a political
recovery in the autumn by promising tough action on law and order and the
budget deficit.
As Mr John Major, the prime minister, began a holiday in Portugal, ministers
moved to recapt-ure the political agenda from the government's rightwing
critics.
The most dramatic initiative came from Mr Michael Howard, the home
secretary, who plans to make life harder for prisoners in British jails. The
proposals, which outraged prison reformers, are intended to underline the
government's determination to regain the initiative on law and order issues.
Ministers are keenly aware that fear of rising crime was a strong factor in
the two recent Conservative by-election defeats.
Mr Howard is also vulnerable to rightwing claims that he has been
out-manoeuvred by Mr Tony Blair, Labour's home affairs spokesman, who has
spoken strongly of the impact of crime on voters.
The proposals were well received by many rightwing Conservatives. Sir Ivan
Lawrence, chairman of the Commons home affairs committee, said the prison
system had to be 'frightening' enough to deter potential offenders. 'The
public are fed up with hearing stories of prisoners not being tasked
sufficiently, being released earlier than the public would think proper, and
enjoying sports and home life,' he said.
Other rightwingers dissented, suggesting that Mr Howard may need to do more
to ensure a trouble-free conference. Sir Teddy Taylor said prisons were
already sufficiently tough.
On government economic policy, Mr Michael Portillo, the chief secretary to
the Treasury, sought to undermine rightwing critics, by repeating pledges to
reduce the Pounds 50bn budget deficit.
Interviewed on Breakfast with Frost on BBC television, Mr Portillo played
down rightwing calls for big public spending cuts, and refused to rule out
tax increases in the Budget. 'Some of the people who are making these
criticisms fear that we are going to let up on our efforts in controlling
public spending. We are not going to do that,' he said.

FT  23 AUG 93 / Clinton joins lobbyists with pitch for Saudi air business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton's personal intervention with King Fahd of Saudi
Arabia on behalf of US aircraft manufacturers could signal a new style of
high pressure export promotion by the US government, according to
administration officials in Washington.
The results of Mr Clinton's telephone call to King Fahd, urging him to buy
Boeing and McDonnell Douglas jets for the fleet modernisation planned by
Saudia, the national airline, are not yet clear.
Senator Patty Murray of Washington, the home state of Boeing, proclaimed
victory last week, but industry experts believe each of the three large
passenger aircraft makers - Boeing, McDonnell and Airbus Industrie of Europe
 -is likely to receive at least a share of the Saudia order.
White House officials said Mr Clinton had encouraged King Fahd to buy
American, but had lobbied for the US aerospace industry in general, rather
than for any particular manufacturer.
'The president has said he would do all he could to promote US aircraft and
aircraft manufacturers,' said Ms Dee Dee Myers, the White House press
secretary.
Ms Murray said: 'What it really shows is that finally government and
business understand that they have a partnership in the worldwide economy.'
President Clinton has repeatedly stressed his desire to make economics a
more central component of US foreign policy and is eager to create more jobs
in export industries.
The proposed modernisation of Saudia's 107-aircraft fleet is expected to
include the purchase of about 60 aircraft, for delivery up to the year 2000.
Some industry officials believe Saudia may not announce the results of its
tender until October. Worth between Dollars 6bn and Dollars 8bn (Pounds 4bn
and Pounds 5.3bn), the order is by far the largest currently being contested
in the civilian aerospace market.
French officials last month said they were confident that Mr Alain Juppe,
France's foreign minister, had succeeded in persuading Saudia to order 44
aircraft from Airbus, but aerospace industry analysts said Saudi irritation
at the early announcement could have cost the European consortium some of
the order.
Boeing and McDonnell officials are worried that Ms Murray's comments could
have the same effect. It is a maxim in the industry always to allow the
customer to announce the order.
US efforts to win the lion's share of the Saudia order, however, appear to
have been sustained and well co-ordinated.
Mr Clinton's telephone sales pitch followed a trip to Saudi Arabia in May by
Mr Ron Brown, the commerce secretary, and has been backed up by the US
Export Import Bank's decision to help Boeing's bid with a preliminary
financing commitment of Dollars 6.2bn in direct loans and guarantees.
US presidents are, however, no strangers to intensive lobbying. Former
president George Bush visited Japan with US car and car part manufacturers,
although this raised hackles in Tokyo - which 10 years earlier had reacted
snootily to Mrs Margaret Thatcher's efforts to persuade Japanese carmakers
to locate in the UK. The Asahi Shimbun newspaper said the then prime
minister had 'become an official in an employment agency'.

The D-Mark's depreciation towards the end of last week has given a more
relaxed air to the exchange rate mechanism's grid. Only 7 percentage points
divided the strongest currency, the Dutch guilder, from the weakest, the
Danish krone, when trading closed on Friday night. That was down from 8.5
percentage points five days earlier. Nevertheless, all the currencies,
except the D-Mark and guilder, are still well outside the fluctuation bands

FT  21 AUG 93 / Microsoft will face new US anti-trust probe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US Justice Department has launched an anti-trust investigation of
Microsoft, the world's largest computer software company, an official of the
government agency announced last night.
The department is taking on the case following a three-year probe by the US
Federal Trade Commission, which was deadlocked twice over whether to take
action against Microsoft. Four commissioners voted, two for and two against
filing suit against the company.
Last month, after the second FTC deadlock, the Justice Department requested
a transfer of documents obtained by the FTC during its investigation.
The department's decision to proceed with the case is a serious blow to
Microsoft, which had dismissed the FTC's investigation as having 'raised
nothing of concern'.
The department's involvement moves the case into the political arena and
could test the Clinton administration's tougher stance on anti-trust
enforcement. If the department finds evidence of anti-competitive activity,
it will have to decide whether the public interest is served by taking
action against one of the most successful high technology companies in the
US.
Microsoft confirmed yesterday that it had been told the department was
taking up the case and said it would co-operate fully with the new
investigation.
The Justice Department said it would 'fully utilise all materials submitted
by the FTC to avoid duplication', and expected to move forward rapidly with
the case.
Competitors have accused Microsoft of using its dominant role in the market
for personal computer operating systems software to limit competition
through unfair marketing tactics.
Last month, Mr Bill Gates, Microsoft chairman, accused Novell, a Microsoft
competitor, of stirring up trouble in Washington in an attempt to force
Microsoft to raise its prices for personal computer software.
Novell, however, alleges that Microsoft aims to limit competition by
offering computer makers discounts if they agree to pay Microsoft software
licence fees for all of the computers of a particular model that they sell.
The company's 'per processor' licensing scheme has already been outlawed in
Korea and is being scrutinised by authorities in other countries.
Microsoft has denied any wrongdoing. The company recently posted earnings of
Dollars 265m (Pounds 178m) on sales of Dollars 1.04bn for its fourth quarter
ended June 30. It reported earnings of Dollars 953m for fiscal 1993, a 35
per cent rise over the previous 12-month period.

FT  21 AUG 93 / Saudi airline 'agrees to buy Dollars 6bn US aircraft': Fears
that premature announcement may threaten deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US AIRCRAFT manufacturers are hoping a premature announcement that they have
clinched the sale of commercial aircraft worth as much as Dollars 6bn
(Pounds 4bn) to the government of Saudi Arabia will not sour the deal, Lisa
Bransten writes from Washington.
Senator Patty Murray this week told the Seattle Times that President Bill
Clinton convinced the Saudis to buy the aircraft for state-owned Saudia
airlines from Boeing and McDonnell Douglas.
The Saudi government has not confirmed any such deal, but its expected
purchase is by far the biggest contract now on offer in the big civil
aircraft market.
Industry analysts speculate that Airbus Industrie, a European consortium,
lost a contract earlier this year to supply a large number of aircraft to
Saudia because a French official announced the sale before the Saudi
government.
Both Boeing and McDonnell Douglas have refused comment on the deal. 'It's
just good business sense to wait for the customer to make the announcement,'
said Mr Paul Binder for Boeing.
Mr Bob Saling, a McDonnell Douglas spokesman, said his company had no
official notification from the Saudis that they would buy the aircraft. 'Any
time there's speculation in the press about something that is not final, top
management gets nervous,' he said.
The purchase could be a boon for the troubled McDonnell, in particular. It
runs a distant third to Boeing and Airbus in sales of commercial aircraft,
with no big purchase for at least the past two years and 6,000 workers laid
off this year.

to two-thirds of the world's tigers. From 1973 to 1989 numbers doubled. But
the poachers have returned and extinction again looms
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PROTECTING the tigers of Ranthambhore, India's best-known wildlife reserve,
almost cost Devi Singh Rathore his life. The 24-year-old forest guard was
shot in the head, face and shoulder by a suspected poacher who fired at his
Jeep with a shotgun. The guard sitting next to him took the full force of
the blast and died instantly. A third man in the back of the vehicle was
also killed and a fourth was injured.
'What happened was terrible,' says Rathore, wincing from the pain of the two
pellets which are still lodged in his body. 'If this carries on it will be
impossible to save the tigers.'
The guards were attacked last April after being called out to track
suspected poachers on the edge of the Ranthambhore reserve in the hot
sandstone hills of southern Rajastan. After three days travelling from
village to village in search of information, they stumbled across three men
camping in a makeshift tent. They arrested two, but the third escaped.
On the way to back to their HQ, the guards stopped for a meal and a rest.
The delay proved fatal. The escaped poacher had got ahead of the guards and,
knowing the road they would have to take, had laid an ambush. Choosing a
steep-sided gorge, he rolled rocks into the road and hid behind the trees.
When the Jeep arrived, the poacher opened fire with a crude muzzle-loading
shotgun. Police later arrested a man and charged him with murder.
Poachers have long been active in India's reserves, hunting tigers, leopards
and other cats for their fur and small animals for meat. Most have been
villagers living near parks with few other means of support.
In the 1970s and 1980s, India had great success in protecting tigers through
a national campaign called Project Tiger, launched in 1973. From one year to
the next the numbers of Indian tigers went up.
From about 2,000 in 1973, India's tiger population rose to 4,300 by 1989,
out of an estimated world total of 6,000-7,000. Over the same period,
India's human population rose by 60 per cent and the economy doubled in
size. India's experience seemed to prove that even in a poor and
over-populated country, protection of the environment and economic
development were not incompatible.
Ranthambhore, the beautiful former hunting preserve of the maharajahs of
Jaipur, achieved particular fame because its tigers forsook traditional
habits and became active during the day - supposedly because they now felt
safe from man. The park, with its ancient forts, Moghul pavilions and lakes,
attracted plenty of tourists.
It was not until last year that conservationists realised that something was
seriously wrong - when reports indicated alarming declines in the numbers of
tigers at India's leading national parks.
At Ranthambhore, the tiger tally dropped from 45 in 1991 to 17 last year,
though the figure was revised this year to 28. For wildlife experts the
conclusion seemed inescapable: tigers were disappearing so fast that their
survival was at stake.
Experts were quick to identify the origin of the new threat - an upsurge in
demand for tiger bone for Chinese medicine. Chinese apothecaries believe
tiger bone has the power to restore energy and sexual prowess. Factories in
China, Taiwan and South Korea produce tens of thousands of bottles of tiger
bone medicine for sale in east Asia and in Chinese communities around the
world.
Conservationists say these factories have in the past used bone from Chinese
tigers, including a vast stock which was accumulated when over 1,000 tigers
were hunted and killed as pests in the 1950s in southern China.
In the last few years this stock seems to have run low, just at a time when
fast economic growth has created millions of new customers for tiger bone
medicine. The trade is quite open. Until recently apothecaries in Tihwa
Street in Taipei displayed tiger bones in their windows, selling at a retail
price of up to Dollars 1,500 per kilogramme.
The Huangshi Long March pharmaceutical factory in Hubei province, northern
China, puts a tiger emblem on its packets of musk and tiger-bone plasters
for use in treating rheumatism.
The first evidence of tigers being killed for their bones in India came in
1987 when poachers operating in the foothills of the Himalaya, in Uttar
Pradesh, were found to have discarded a skin. Proof came last year at
Ranthambhore when a local poacher named Gopal Mogya and an accomplice, a
meat trader, were caught on the edge of the park carrying a gun and a bag of
bones.
The police say that Mogya confessed to selling bones and skins to a butcher
in the nearby town of Sawai Madhopur. In turn, the butcher said he supplied
Mohamed Ashiq and Mohamed Ahmed, two brothers who own a tanning business in
Fatehpur, a centre of the leather industry, some 200 miles from Sawai
Madhopur.
Mohan Singh Bhati, the police superintendent at Sawai Madhopur, who
estimates that 14-18 tigers have been poached from Ranthambhore, says it is
the first time Indian police have broken such an extensive poaching ring.
From Fatehpur, the trail led to New Delhi where the police are investigating
several fur and skin traders but have made no further arrests. Wildlife
experts working for Traffic, a unit of the World Wide Fund for Nature, which
monitors trade in endangered species, say that Delhi is an important centre
for dealing in skins, bones and other products.
The principal traders are often Kashmiris, who have moved their businesses
to Delhi. Kashmiris have a tradition of fur-making; they also have
long-standing experience of trading with foreigners. They established
world-wide networks in the fur trade before international agreements in the
1970s suppressed the legitimate trade in wild animal products.
A few fur shops trade openly in New Delhi, for example in Yashwant Place, a
run-down shopping centre favoured by hawkers dealing in smuggled wrist
watches and Russian champagne. But Traffic's experts believe that most of
the skins are smuggled out of India, mainly to Kathmandu in Nepal, where
there is also a sizeable Kashmiri community.
Nepal, like India, has tough laws against trading wild animal skins, but
they are barely enforced. Tourists can easily buy coats made of leopard and
other skins in shops near big hotels. Traffic researchers who visited the
area last year counted 294 coats made from the skins of over 100 leopards,
14 clouded leopards and 2,500 other wild cats.
Traffic says tiger skins and bones are smuggled out of India by the same
route but are rarely seen because of the international publicity that tigers
attract. The bones are mostly ground into powder and carried by couriers
overland into Tibet or by air to Bangkok and Hong Kong. Vivek Menon, of
Traffic's Delhi office, says it is futile trying to estimate how much bone
is taken out of India. 'Very few people are arrested. And they are always
the minions.'
The conservationists' top priority is to try to stop the bone-related
poaching. India, Nepal and China are all signatories of the 1973 Convention
on Trade in Endangered Species, the main international agreement restricting
trade in wildlife.
In line with the convention, all these countries have passed tough laws
against trade in the products of endangered species. But enforcement varies
greatly. Even in India, which has a comparatively good record, there is a
loophole that allows traders in Kashmir to deal in skins taken from pre-1979
stocks.
Under pressure from conservationists, governments are starting to act. China
has announced plans for an east Asian wildlife protocol, an agreement to
restrict trade in wildlife, to be signed later this year by ministers from
east Asian countries. But it is difficult to see what benefits the protocol
will bring, other than to remind governments of their existing commitments.
Kamal Nath, the Indian minister for the environment and forests, says
protecting the tiger is an issue for all countries. 'We need help,' he says.
The help he has in mind is pressure on east Asian countries brought by the
US and other export markets.
Conservationists also believe that important changes are needed in the
running of the 19 reserves which now come under Project Tiger. These
reserves are the pick of India's wildlife parks, sanctuaries not only for
tigers but for numerous other species, including leopards, elephants and the
country's last surviving rhinoceroses. The decline in the numbers of tigers
has drawn attention to serious shortcomings in the management of these
parks.
Valmik Thapar, author of studies on the tigers of Ranthambhore, says the
only way forward is to involve local people more in the running of the park.
Former poachers would make good gamekeepers. Villagers could be encouraged
to work as forest guards. Informants could be paid for tips about poachers.
Without such efforts, the tiger may be doomed.
Christian Tyler (Private View) and James Morgan (As They Say In Europe) are
on holiday.

FT  21 AUG 93 / Hawks &amp; Handsaws: Time to strike camp
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL THOMPSON-NOEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MY observation, last week, that some people regarded Country Life magazine
as antediluvian, mimsy mamsy, camp and affected has drawn hundreds of
protesting letters from every inglenook and burrow in rural Britain. The
writers did not object to 'antediluvian.' 'Mimsy mamsy' wasn't mentioned.
'Affected' they ignored. But 'camp' drove them wild.
Typical was Maj-Gen Sir Richard Walter Brian Colin Mark Heathcote-Chubb, who
wrote from Cornwall: 'You are an abomination, Sir. I expect you are a young
person, wet behind the ears, but you are obviously a communist and probably
a pervert if you believe that Country Life is 'camp.' It is not in the least
wit 'camp.' It describes traditional pursuits and values - hunting,
shooting, steeplechasing, pottery, thatching and rural cooking - that must
be meaningless to a degenerate like you from an inner-city sewer like
Notting Hill. It's a pity they abolished conscription. A poseur like you
would be whistling a different tune if you found yourself in the vanguard of
the relief of Sarajevo . . . '
Ordinarily, I would have dealt with the major-general by sending him a nice
postcard - a scene by Caravaggio, say - with an enigmatic message, and left
it at that. But camp is such an interesting word that I have looked into it
more closely.
My dictionary says: camp adj. informal. 1 homosexual 2 exaggeratedly
effeminate 3 being so outrageously artificial, affected, inappropriate or
exaggerated as to be considered amusing (origin unknown) - campness n.
Yet there is more to it than that. Here are seven witty/perceptive things
you could say about camp adj:
Camp depends on where you pitch it.
Camp is not necessarily homosexual. Anyone or anything can be camp. But it
takes one to know one.
Camp is a disguise that fails.
Camp is laughing at The Importance of Being Earnest without knowing why.
Camp is laughing at The Importance of Being Earnest AND knowing why.
Camp is anti-art in the same way physical desire is anti-creative.
Camp is a lie which tells the truth.
That is not my own list. I have extracted it from a longer list that appears
at the start of Camp, by Philip Core - a Who's Who and a What's What of the
subject published by Plexus in 1984.
Says Core in his introduction: 'Ronald Firbank, the frivolous English author
from the world of literary camp, once wrote: 'I must admit that somewhere
deep down inside of me there is a field with cows browsing.' From a fop who
kept pet goldfish and fed them real pearls (artificial ones, he claimed,
they spat out), such a confidence, set in the context of grand hotels and
Edwardian society, is just one brilliant example of the stance of concealed
normalcy essential to the camp psyche.'
Most of the entries in Core's lexicon of camp cause no surprise: Garbo,
Dali, Warhol, Wilde, Sitwell (Edith, Osbert, Sacheverell), Caravaggio,
Cartland (Dame Barbara), Brideshead Revisited, Bronzino, Jagger, Isherwood,
Humphries (Barry), Hockney, Heath (Sir Edward), Gielgud, Garland, Fellini,
Erte, Dietrich, Dallesandro (Joe), d'Annunzio (Gabriele), The Damned, Vidal
(Gore), Valentino (Rudolph), Strachey, Proust, Mishima (Yukio), opera ('the
campest of all high culture') and Waugh (Evelyn: 'tweediness, snobbery . . .
consistently combined awe and reverence for a spoilt and arrogant upper
class with an irrepressible mockery of the same attributes which more than
pinpointed his own anomalies').
Disappointingly, the author's investigation cleaves mainly to the arts. He
could have broadened it to include industrial camp, financial camp,
political and scientific camp. Politics is especially fertile.
Consider the British government. Kenneth Clarke? Michael Heseltine? Michael
Portillo? Michael Howard? Malcolm Rifkind? Virginia Bottomley? Peter Brooke?
John Gummer? Sir Patrick Mayhew? Peter Lilley? John Redwood? William
Waldegrave? Douglas Hurd? Each of these ministers is as camp as a row of
tents. Perhaps John Major's biggest problem is that he is not remotely camp.
All in all, I am convinced that Country Life is an example of camp. But I am
starting to wonder about 'mimsy mamsy.'

FT  21 AUG 93 / Summer Rites: The British class system all at sea
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL SPIVEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PHRASE 'classless society' conjures up all the excesses of the French
Revolution. But British premier John Major is not a second Robespierre, and
it has to be said that his vision of classlessness remains utterly
chimerical. To appreciate how chimerical, you have only to cross the
Channel.
It is not necessary to disembark. Simply make the crossing, once a year, to
confirm that egalite, in British eyes, is still regarded as a coarse
continental concept, as distastefully remote from England's shores as foie
gras, horse-butchers and pistol-waving policemen. It yields the best form of
deck entertainment: pacing the various levels of your ferry and noting the
many modulations and nuances of British inequality.
The aristocracy is thoroughly conspicuous by its absence. Time was when you
might have spotted bulk consignments of the country's peerage, off to
fritter their boodle at the gaming tables of Boulogne and Deauville. The
seriously rich still go to France but not to those parts, and certainly not
by means so putrid and earth-bound as a ferry.
One can see why the gentry stays clear, for the ferries have taken on the
unfortunate function of transporting to France great numbers of Britons
whose natural inclination is to have as little as possible to do with France
or anything French.
The irony is that The Sun, staunch organ of proletarian francophobia,
actually promotes the sale of discounted tickets; gets the charabancs down
from Benfleet and Basildon and fills the ferries with cheery excursionists
whose ancestors might once have been flogged into some sort of service by
Nelson or Jellicoe but who now present a sorry sight.
The younger ones like to drink, drop their trousers and expose all their
paunchy boorishness; the older ones like to drink, too, exploring all nooks
of the duty-free shop and raising toasts to French inferiority with a magnum
of Blue Nun.
Give them half-an-hour in the bar and they will regale the entire vessel
with choruses from Vera Lynn. On arrival in Calais, they want nothing more
than to be greeted by a familiar Cockney voice and a leaflet showing the way
to the nearest depot of cheap beer.
No wonder the middle classes shy away from the ship's saloon: the last thing
one wants to see en route to the Dordogne is a derriere from Basildon. So
middle-class travellers are to be found in the restaurant, or perhaps
peeling hard-boiled eggs and spotting petrels on the blustery upper deck.
The really shrewd bourgeoisie choose their ferry companies with care. They
may know, for example, that one company, Britanny Ferries, recently tried to
ban motor cyclists from passage. There were immediate  - and probably
reasonable - protests from the lobby of well-groomed motor cyclists. But we
class-watchers know perfectly well what that ferry company was up to.
It was not so much motor cyclists per se they were trying to deter as a
gamut of types likely to give offence to the better class of passenger. Men
with rings thrust through their ears and dragons emblazoned on their arms.
Unspeakable bovine characters who have not only Artexed their ceilings but
then trumped that vulgarity by installing electric chandeliers. The last
thing that the middle-class mariner wants is fraternity on a ferry with this
mob.
It says a great deal about Robespierre's legacy that a correspondingly
delicate classification of French travellers is difficult to achieve. On my
last crossing I scrutinised a sizeable French detachment for signs of their
answer to Essex Man. I saw one chunky Frenchman sporting a tracksuit and a
medallion but he turned out to be courteous to the purser, sober at his
repast and nicely informed about the later Matisse.
In any case, l'homme de Pas de Calais is an unconvincing sort. If he does
exist, it is hard to see why on earth he might want to make a day trip to
Dover or Newhaven.
As a sociological exercise, traversing la manche is really an end in itself.
The proper attitude is to study and enjoy all its cheek-by-jowel dynamics.
There may be many good reasons for not using the Channel Tunnel when it
opens, but the best of all, I think, is that it will be terribly dull.

<TEXT>
MINERS (Radio 4, Tuesday) was the second of three programmes about four
young men made redundant by the closure of their pit, Houghton Main, 'the
focal point' of Darfield village in Yorkshire, where they live. Each has
some Pounds 20,000 redundancy money but, as they tell the presenter, Allan
Beswick, don't want to invest in stocks and shares or start a new business.
At the moment, three have work, salvaging or under contract at nearby pits,
not likely to last long; the third has an injured thumb.
Their wives are more talkative than they, with notions about Range Rovers
and starting a new business, so that in two months their men could have nice
white hands: spending priorities, modest enough for people with Pounds
20,000 or so in hand, are holiday, car, redecorate the bedroom. The men, who
have never known anything but mining, find nothing else interesting and
anyway are against risks. 'I hate the dole office,' one said; asked what
wages he would expect, he entered 'Pounds 210 a week,' what he was used to.
'I'd rather give the money back and be my own man,' was typical. 'I'm not
proud of the industry - they can do what they want, I'm not bothered.'
On Thursday, Radio 4 dealt again with current problems in The Enemy Within.
Presented by Marek Kohn, about drugs, but historical rather than critical.
There were references to Police-Sergeant Lyle and jazz drummer Flash Winston
in the 1950s (who they?); but before them we went back to Coleridge, de
Quincey and others who used laudanum, including Gladstone and Mrs Beeton.
The 1868 Pharmacy Act boosted the 'opium dens'; then we turned to fiction,
with a reading from Dorian Gray and a sketch of Dr Fu Manchu. Marijuana
became more prevalent after the end of the 1914-18 war, with Club Eleven
(Winston's joint) notorious. Some black immigrants retained theit accustomed
habits. Of inside knowledge of current drug usage, hardly a word; any day's
broadsheet newspaper will probably tell more.
It isn't likely that Radio 1 FM was influenced by Plato's Symposium on Radio
3 last Sunday, but on Monday it had the first Loud and Proud, a programme
dedicated to gays and lesbians - I use the current words as in the
programme. I heard the first quarter-hour, but felt the atmosphere too
private, mates swopping their own affairs. We were told the best places in
Glasgow for pick-ups (though Paulette, the presenter, is a Manchester girl),
and how you could distinguish your targets. A teacher said he reckoned one
schoolchild in ten was potentially gay; it was proposed that sex education
in schools should include the question. I dare say a fair number of gays and
lesbians listened, out of curiosity if nothing else, but apart from the tips
to likely scenes they would not have found it very helpful, still less
amusing.
How many listeners to Loud and Proud heard Radio 3's Sunday play, The
Leftover Heart by Andrew Alty? It has a similar theme, but used in a more
less frivolous way. Its hero, Tom, is based on Tennessee Williams; he is a
successful writer, lives on booze and tablets, has a craving for young men,
and a sister, Rose, in a home for the insane. The family details are like
those that are known; the fiction woven around them is simple. Tom is
visited in a Chicago hotel by Johnny, a young man from a dating agency, who
reveals that, 20 years before, Tom had slept with his mother in Kansas City,
that they are, in fact, father and son.
Tom decides to quit writing, to settle down with Johnny, to sack his
long-established secretary Vi (a man). But guilty recollections of poor mad
Rose, interpolated as anachronistic interludes, are too hard for him; and Vi
persuades Johnny that his hopes will prove optimistic. So Vi is back, Johnny
is out, and Tom is writing again. Not a very convincing tale, and only
moderately played under Miriam Segal's direction.

FT  21 AUG 93 / Arts: All animated about fairy tales - Tim Burt discusses
Disney's plans to reinvigorate the cinema cartoon / Screen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RENAISSANCE started with a rabbit called Roger. Although a little slow
and rather clumsy, Roger has reinvigorated the world's appetite for an art
form that 10 years ago was said to be facing extinction - the cinema
cartoon.
Who Framed Roger Rabbit?, released by Touchstone in 1988, won critical
acclaim and a couple of Oscars; more importantly, it grossed Dollars 154m
and persuaded Walt Disney, the US entertainment group, there was money in
feature-length animated films.
Disney, concerned at the losses on its theme park investment in Europe, has
decided to increase production of its profitable feature films. In the past,
movies were released at a rate of one every three years; that gap narrowed
last year with Aladdin, Disney's latest offering, following the success in
1991 of Beauty and the Beast. The company now to plans to produce two
feature-length animated films a year and is banking on European expertise to
help draw them.
The US company regards Europe, and London in particular, as a centre for
excellence in modern animation. So the skills which first gained
international recognition with the antics of Roger Rabbit are now being
actively pursued by the most famous studios of them all.
A senior executive from Walt Disney this week arrived in London to recruit
artists for a new generation of animated films. Unlike classics such as Snow
White and the Seven Dwarfs, these productions will not be years but months
in the making. Max Howard, vice president of Walt Disney Animation in
Florida, thinks European animators are the ones to make it happen.
Walt Disney, he says, is keen to produce more animated features because,
against all the expectations of the early 1980s, they are proving wildly
popular. Attracted by the new dimensions of Who Framed Roger Rabbit? - the
first widely-distributed feature to use computer technology - cinema
audiences have flocked to see Beauty and the Beast, which grossed Dollars
147m in the US and Pounds 94m in the UK.
In Aladdin, due to be released in the UK later this year, one of the
characters is entirely computer driven. A magic carpet - hand drawn and then
committed to a computer's memory - moves around the screen in a way few
artists could emulate. It turns and twist in three dimensions, offering the
directors camera angles which where previously only available to live film
features.
Howard, who ran the Walt Disney studio in London where Roger Rabbit was
made, believes computers now allow an audience to enter the world of the
cartoon characters. That faith has paid off handsomely. Aladdin has grossed
more than Dollars 212m in the US and Walt Disney expects that figure to
double after its international release.
Audience demand for such special effects has been a major catalyst for
Disney, which intends to employ some of Britain's best animators on future
production such as The Hunchback of Notre Dame and Pocahontas, both
scheduled for release in 1995. There has also been a lucrative spin-off for
other UK talent including lyricist Tim Rice, who is currently working on The
Lion King, Disney's animated African tale, along with actor Jeremy Irons and
rock star Elton John.
At the company's studios in Glendale and Orlando, however, the contribution
of these famous names pales against that of James Baxter, a London art
school graduate recruited by Disney after working on Roger Rabbit. Baxter
went on to create Belle, the feisty heroine of Beauty and the Beast.
The US group's willingness to import overseas talent, however, masks a
growing frustration in the UK that there are no backers willing to
underwrite a home-produce animation feature. Richard Williams, the creator
of Who Framed Roger Rabbit?, has failed to complete his long-awaited Thief
and The Cobbler and has returned disillusioned to his native Canada.
Only on television, where Channel Four and SC4 in Wales have invested
heavily in animation, is there a growing market. But even so, many
independent producers feel acclaimed outside the UK and ignored at home.
David Sproxton, co-director of Aardman Animation in Bristol, which last year
won an Oscar for best animated short film, says, 'The fact that Disney can
come here reflects that we do not have resources. We have skills and ideas
but not finance.' He fears that overseas studios are snapping up UK
animators because there is not enough work at home. Without substantial
financial backing, he predicts most animation studios will go on doing what
they do best - making TV commercials.
At Disney, Max Howard admits that funding has been the main brake on UK
animation but suggests that the industry may also have been hindered by the
stories it decided to bring to the screen. Walt Disney is not taking that
kind of risk. It plans to serve up more favourite dishes - fairy tales and
fables. Howard says the productions coming across the Atlantic now contain
fewer spoonfuls of sugar than in the past, but Disney is determined to pour
in enough syrup to keep hold of its biggest audience, the young teenagers.
'Great quality animation won't make a film a success,' he says. 'Look at
Aladdin or Beauty and the Beast. There has been a renaissance, but it's
still about finding the right stories to tell.'

FT  21 AUG 93 / Arts: What a cultural mix] - Alastair Macaulay on the work
of Mark Morris and Peter Sellars / The Edinburgh Festival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE opening week of this Edinburgh Festival gives us a chance to compare the
work of two of the most talked-of young American theatre people of our time
 -the choreographer Mark Morris and the director Peter Sellars. They have
collaborated on three opera productions, and they have much in common.
However, their differences have become increasingly apparent, and it is time
to compare and contrast.
What do they have in common? Both are in their 30s; are smart guys; give
good interview copy to journalists; endorse multiculturalism; oppose
American cultural imperialism; use baroque or modern or Asian music; like to
mix high and low culture; employ irony a lot. In their theatre work, both
like to take something period and set it in the present day. (For those who
cannot make it to Edinburgh, TV has already illustrated this. Anyone can see
the resemblance between Peter Sellars's versions of Mozart's Cos fan tutte,
set in an American diner, and Mark Morris's The Hard Nut, which transposes
Tchaikovsky's Nutcracker to an 1960s American nuclear family.)
Talk to people about Sellars, and sooner or later they say 'But he talks so
well.' (Morris is a hilarious loudmouth whose indiscretions have often got
him into trouble.) Sellars has a knack for saying what goes down well with
liberally-minded audiences. A favourite theme of his is multiculturalism; in
particular, he sings the praises of the cultures of the Pacific Rim (as
opposed to tired old Eurocentric culture). But his work shows that he has
only one subject: his own highly American form of cultural self-hatred.
Sellars exemplifies American political correctness at its most crass. He is
anti-Eurocentric, anti-paternalist, anti-imperialist. Is he pro-anything?
Nothing that he can express. He certainly isn't pro-Mozart or pro-Aeschylus;
he changes them right, left and centre to suit his anti-American thesis.
Take his current version of poor Aeschylus's The Persians. Once I heard he
was going to present it, I knew he would set it in Baghdad after the Gulf
War; and he did. But who would have thought he or his 'translator,' Robert
Auletta, would have the nerve to call the Greeks of 480 BC 'the most
arrogant people in the world' (ie American)? In 480 BC, the Greeks were not
even a nation.
It is revealing that Sellars is not interested in bringing out any
Persian/Iraqi characteristics in Xerxes/Saddam, who turns out to be the most
crudely American person onstage. To him, Xerxes and Themistocles, Saddam and
Bush are just the same (except that Bush is worse). Sellars may preach
multiculturalism, but he practices monoculturalism. True, he squirts on a
few bits of Indian/Javanese movement exotica onto other characters, but they
are fake - just addenda to keep up his pc credentials.
It is also revealing that he tries to make Xerxes/Saddam a justifiably
Oedipal type. So I (Xerxes) did some bad things? Dad (Darius), it's your
fault because you never showed me any love; though actually I thank you,
because you made me brutal. But, Mom (Atossa), you always loved me, so the
feeling's mutual. (Aeschylus did not even have mother and son onstage
together - he probably had them played by the same actor. Sellars has them
end the play in a protracted silent loving clinch.)
All of which might be tolerable or stimulating if only Sellars made it
lively. But The Persians is very, very boring, and it reveals something that
has been too little mentioned: that Sellars's sheer stagecraft is crummy and
his actors act lousily. (I have seen Greek tragedies in Greek that were far
more absorbing than this - much shorter, too.)
Sellars is a conceptualist with only one concept. What he does to The
Persians is the same formula he applied to Mozart and to The Death of
Klinghoffer. (It's so predictable that La Gran Scena, that travesty opera
group, now does a 'Peter Sellars' version of the final scene of Der
Rosenkavalier - set in a shopping mall.)
This is the reverse of Mark Morris, whose work is full of obvious structural
virtuosity, vivid demonstrations of the possibilities of stage space,
multiculturalism so profound that he has made whole dances in different folk
styles, and (in other dances) has fused them. Almost the only predictable
thing about his work is his way of making heterosexuality and homosexuality
so equal that there seems to be no difference between them. Much of his work
is about love; and most of it is ultimately affirmative. He is both pc and
unAmerican in several ways, but has also celebrated several aspects of
American culture.
Often he sets a work in the present day, but sometimes - witness his 1991
Brussels staging of Mozart's Figaro, or his new dance, A Spell - in period;
and his musicality, with its strange blend of irony and fidelity, is the
least predictable thing of all. Both Sellars and Morris love various kinds
of gestural sign-language, but Sellars' use of it is incompetent in terms of
theatrical legibility or dynamics. If you went from Morris's Dido and Aeneas
to Sellars's Glyndebourne Magic Flute, both choc-a-bloc with gesticulation,
you could see how like and unlike the two men are; and that Morris is the
artist that Sellars would like to be.
Peter Sellars's version of The Persians ends its run at the Lyceum with two
performances today; Mark Morris's second programme, of British premieres,
runs at the Meadowbank Stadium until Monday

FT  21 AUG 93 / Arts: Schiff hits the right note - Richard Fairman finds
that Schubert and Janacek have a singing lyricism in common
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MUSIC side of the festival is starting to get some mileage out of its
Schubert and Janacek theme. Both composers explored some of their most
personal feelings in their chamber music and the morning recitals at the
Queen's Hall are invariably among Edinburgh's rewarding events.
That is certainly how it seemed on Wednesday, when Andras Schiff gave a
programme drawn from the two composers' piano music. In this area, as in
every other, it is the differences between them that seem obvious. Schubert
left his most important work in the piano sonatas, Janacek in freer pieces.
Schubert asked classical forms to shoulder structures of enormous
architectural breadth and power; Janacek's thoughts occur in short, sudden,
immediate bursts.
Out of these extremes Schiff's playing revealed with unexpected clarity one
progression of thought which the two do have in common. Each has a singing
lyricism at his heart, in Schubert derived from song, in Janacek from opera
and his fascination with the sounds and rhythms of human speech; but both
are led by the very intensity of their music to climaxes which are
insistent, forceful, even violent.
Schiff is not a Viennese interpreter of Schubert who sets out to make the
music charm. In the E flat Sonata there was no question of him giving way to
temptation and loosening the rhythms so that they went with a smile and a
popular dance-like lilt. His playing was sensitive, but straight-laced. For
the late, much greater C Minor Sonata he aims for as wide a scale as the
music can bear, taking it from barely-voiced lyrical moments to a fierce
attack on the climaxes. A lack of affection is less of a drawback here and
the performance attained an impressive stature.
His Janacek was the Piano Sonata (other major pieces were to follow on
Friday). Extremes of expression are built into this score, written in the
heat of patriotic rage after a young Czech worker was killed by troops loyal
to the German authorities. Schiff is quick to react, communicating both its
pain and its heartfelt sympathy. For the music of both composers he has
proved the festival's first top-class advocate so far.
It is difficult to say which was missed most the next morning at the Queen's
Hall: Schiff's ability to say exactly what he wants or his ambitions for the
music. The Gould Trio, prizewinners in the UK, Holland and Australia, in
fact lauded round the world, followed him with a mixed programme of Janacek
and Schubert chamber music, including the Czech composer's Violin Sonata and
the Austrian's best-known Piano Trio (in B flat).
There was nothing sub-standard about the way they played any of the items,
but the power of the music had been diluted. In the Schubert Trio phrases
continually asked to stretch, breathe and be filled with expression, but
they went for little. The three musicians, technically very able, well
balanced, with a good sense of style, need to take the next crucial step. Be
daring] - let the power of Schubert's and Janacek's inspiration release
those inhibitions.

FT  21 AUG 93 / Arts: Bjork's 'Debut' - live
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BERLIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BJORK'S idiosyncratic vocal style was one of the main reasons why Iceland's
contribution to rock music, the Sugarcubes, always remained something of an
acquired taste. Yet her first solo record, Debut, has proved a surprising
success. Its occasional jazzy tinge and off-centred lyrics about pained
love, together with the huge sales and Bjork's wonderful cheekbones, have
even drawn comparisons with Sade, even though their musical styles are
utterly different. Bjork is in grave danger of becoming the next thinking
man's rock crumpet; a fate she does not deserve.
Bjork's voice dominates Debut. She wrote all the songs and undoubtedly the
eclectic mixture of styles - techno, bebop, jazz ballad, reggae and Asian -
reflects her tastes. Even so, it is very much a producer's album, the styles
blended into a distinctive but consistent whole in the studio by Nellee
Hooper who previously produced Soul to Soul. Now here was Bjork onstage at
the Forum on Thursday night for the inevitable showcase concert with a six
piece band, most of whom had not played on the album and whose surnames, she
said afterwards, she did not know.
As a live show, the evening lacked shape or a sense of the dramatic. Bjork
ran through the songs from her album and, once she had played them, returned
only for the briefest encore. But as a display for those songs it was a
success. The inability of a live band, even one with so much technology, to
duplicate a sophisticated studio sound helped pick out the different
influences, highlight the contrasts between songs and emphasise the
muscularity of Bjork's more dance-influenced tunes.
'Human Behaviour' - the hit, the first track on Debut and the first song in
the show - was propelled by a slinky, club beat. 'Venus as a Boy' combined a
reggae bass line with flute and the Asian-textured violin of Nawaz Ali Khan.
On 'The Anchor Song' Bjork sings simply over jazz saxophone tootlings.
Hippyish curls and wisps of violin and flute or jazzy honks from saxophone
and clarinet gave a lighter texture to the powerful background of drums,
percussion, bass and keyboards.
Whatever the arrangements and however good the material, she lives by her
voice. It is certainly distinctive. At times it is almost gruff, at others
it floats up, sharp and penetrating. It is always fragile but has surprising
power, although there were times when the band threatened to crush it.
Yet Bjork's singing also has its weaknesses. 'Like Someone In Love' is
constructed and presented like a jazz ballad, sung over keyboards twiddled
to imitate jazz guitar. But her phrasing is strangely random, her grip on
the melody slippery at best; she does not seem to care, beating the song
breathlessly to a paste, with immense charm and personality. The crowd
received it with rapture.
Bjork's strengths were clear in the last song of the set 'Big Time
Sensuality', a knowing piece of faux soul, electro meets Stax. Bjork barked,
swooped and shouted over a braying saxophone and relentless rhythm; a
wonderful dance song, a climax to any live show. In front of her, the great
mass of the audience stood as if their feet had been superglued to the dance
floor, happily lost in Bjork's strange territory, drawn to this latest
dreamy, sub-poetic woman singer-song-writer.
At the Forum Kentish Town. Bjork supports U2 at Wembley today and plays at
Wolverhampton Civic Hall on September 13 and the Manchester Academy on
September 14.

FT  21 AUG 93 / Arts: 'Job' and 'The Labryinth'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RODERICK DUNNETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE OF THE Dartington Festival's visitors this year has been the Czech
composer Petr Eben, whom some see as one of the important successors to
Messiaen. This week he gave the first of two Dartington organ recitals
focusing on his own music.
Eben's works are often conceived on a large scale. The Labyrinth of the
World and the Paradise of the Heart, and Job, the two works heard at St
Mary's, Totnes, and at the restored former Cistercian Buckfast Abbey, occupy
almost an hour apiece. Each consists of eight or more sections of music. By
interspersing a speaker, Eben echoes a genre favoured by Stravinsky (to
texts by Gide and Cocteau), Honegger and Gerhard (after Camus), with the
audience cast as spectateurs to a kind of humanist medieval morality.
There is a conscious didactic purpose. The prophet's tribulations and
fortitude supply the lesson of Job; in the new work, which uses extracts
from the ill-fated Czech philosopher-theologian Jan Amos Komensky
(Comenius), central Europe's equivalent to Bunyan or Langland, we witness a
trail of bourgeois hypocrisy and jumped-up officialdom, satirised with the
pungent wit of the brothers Capek or Hasek's Schweik.
Buckfast's cipher-prone four-manual organ produced a curiously under-defined
performance of Job from David Titterington, who has recorded the work
admirably. By contrast, The Labyrinth of the World and the Paradise of the
Heart is a 'work in progress', still evolving through a process of
improvisation. The joins inevitably showed, and there is the added danger
that the organ interludes seem to mimic, as much as illuminate, what has
just been read.
The contrasts and build-ups were well measured, with lively registration.
Eben's sinuous, diabolic writing, is has been said, can be more effective
than its opposite. But it is in understatement that he most excels, as where
the plainsong unexpectedly transmits into the tenor using an 8-or-4- foot
reed on the pedal.
The key to this performance was a first-class speaker, the baritone Thomas
Helmsey, who gave Comenius' text the Rabelaisian vent it deserves. Yet even
this vigour and Eben's own intensity could not prevent the final volte-face,
an unadorned statement of Comenius' hymn from the Leiden MS, seeming at best
naive, at worst sentimental.

FT  21 AUG 93 / Arts: Back to Lake Wobegon - Garrison Keillor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GARRISON Keillor has popped into the Ambassadors Theatre for a few cosy
chats (he is there tonight), honing up on the homespun before taking it to
the Edinburgh Festival. Keillor is that soft, slow, sweet-voiced
Mid-Westerner you hear on Radio Four recounting the quiet excitements of
Lake Wobegon, that half real Minnesota town where the clock has stopped in
all our innocent childhoods.
On air and in his books Keillor is as composed and cool as frozen yoghurt:
in the flesh he is more challenging. He looks harmless enough, like those
photographs of a British Rail regional manager you see at stations, but then
you notice the red socks and realise that the eccentricity is manufactured.
Although Keillor lives off his re-creation of an idyllic past, where strict
Puritan farming families worshipped niceness and perfected politeness and
found their pleasures in gospel choirs and the local radio station's blend
of farmstock prices and gentle humour, he is actually the outsider, the one
who escaped to New York.
He is now quite nasty about the life he left behind, slating it for its
narrow mindedness and tedium. It is rather as if Barbara Cartland scorned
virginity. We want to believe in these decent folk; we do not want our
images over-thrown. Keillor treads a particularly difficult path in
rubbishing his sources, because for much of his show he is supported by the
Hopeful Gospel Quartet who sing the good old tunes, where the Lord is a firm
rock and the Devil gets his deserts.
The music is the strongest feature. It is rare to hear white gospel, much
more sentimental than black gospel, and close to country music. It is the
joy of the evening. For the rest Keillor seemed uncertain as he brought us
the latest from Lake Wobegon, sang some clever songs, and recited old
ballads. He can still hit the spot, especially on the advantages of being an
uncle over a father in 'Uncle New York', and how Bizet was really Duanne
from Omaha, but there were signs of nerves and a woeful inability to know
when to stop.
Through the airwaves and on the pages Keillor drifts us back into a secure
family nest of crumpets and cocoa, with mild plesantries for entertainment.
In the flesh our illusions are inevitably shattered.

FT  21 AUG 93 / Arts: British dance to the fore - Prudence Skeen on the
importance of supporting our modern dance companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PRUDENCE SKEEN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   IN Montreal they are preparing for the British dance explosion
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
it is the main attraction in this year's International Festival de Nouvelle
Danse which takes place in October. In Europe British dance has been watched
with growing interest. Last year the British Council promoted a two-week
season in Brussels, and this year Hamburg is hosting an exposition of
British dance which includes workshops, discussions and videos. Frankfurt,
Lisbon, Marseilles and Rotterdam are all planning seasons of British dance,
and Britain won two of the four sections in this year's International
Competition for Dance Videos in Frankfurt.
Such examples of success suggest a significant momentum of interest and one
that has gone surprisingly unsung within our shores. Indeed, many of our
leading arts correspondents have queried the Arts Council's recent
prioritising of the art form.
The names that are exciting audiences around the world are among the most
daring and diverse of our contemporary dance companies. They include
Jonathan Burrows, Michael Clark, DV8, Shobana Jeyasingh, V-Tol and Lea
Anderson's Cholmondeleys and Featherstonehaughs. According to John Ashford,
Director of The Place Theatre in London and a prime mover in promoting
British dance, it is the variety and unpredictability of our dance artists
that fascinates. Our foreign neighbours find 'a wealth of curiously
provocative work, indicative of the eccentricity of British culture'.
Perhaps it is this eccentricity which causes us to ignore, even decry, this
part of our cultural treasure.
In giving priority to dance in its 1994/95 allocation, the Arts Council is
honouring a pledge made in 1989 when it recognised dance as 'an emerging and
developing art form'. Dance has grown up since then, but it still receives
barely half of the funding given to drama or music. This is in spite of
dance being one of the most expensive forms to produce; the fact that almost
all dance companies tour for many weeks each year; and that by its very
nature dance is collaborative and provides creative opportunities for
musicians, designers and visual artists, TV and video producers; and many of
today's composers cite contemporary dance as one of the main conduits for
their music. Nonetheless, Pounds 20m of taxpayers' money from the Arts
Council's allocation goes into supporting dance and the public has a right
to know how this amount is spent and how decisions for its distribution are
made.
Almost three-quarters (Pounds 15.4m) of the Arts Council's dance allocation
goes to support four main classical ballet companies: The Royal Ballet, The
Birmingham Royal Ballet, English National Ballet and Northern Ballet
Theatre. They all tour extensively, with the present exception of The Royal
Ballet which is planning to tour more widely in future.
The remaining Pounds 5m supports the rest, that diverse and unpredictable
wealth of dance that is making such a significant contribution to our
cultural credibility overseas. In addition to the companies already
mentioned, the rest includes Adzido, Britain's largest African dance
company, Rambert Dance Company, London Contemporary Dance Theatre, Green
Candle, Siobhan Davies Dance Company, Adventures in Motion Pictures - and
seven National Dance Agencies.
This network of agencies was started by the Arts Council in close
association with Regional Arts Boards and local authorities in an attempt to
promote dance at a more approachable level. Any assumption that this is just
another administrative structure is belied by a visit to, say, Dance City in
Newcastle or Thamesdown Dance Studio in Swindon, where the atmosphere
pulsates with energy, movement, creation and participation. For this is the
purpose of the agencies - to provide homes for dance where professional
artists can create, perform and teach and where those who wish to
participate can do so by attending a wide choice of classes and other
activities.
But still a level of public resistance remains. Dance is an elusive, subtle
medium, expressing high emotion in disciplined physical form. Classical
ballet may have familiar narratives and melodies; its forms and conventions
provide a framework for understanding. Contemporary dance, in common with
other contemporary arts, sometimes disrupts or ignores 'the rules'. This may
make it controversial and perhaps never more so than when the debate
includes funding. Its achievements might be ignored, but its more wayward
manifestations make an ideal focus for brickbats.
An element of the Arts Council's dance budget will always be devoted to new
work. Some of this will be difficult, will be inaccessible, will be
questioned by those who do not understand. Many of us do not understand  -
nor immediately appreciate - all that we see, but I am reminded of Marie
Rambert who, after a lifetime working in classical ballet, was prepared, at
the age of 74, to permit her beloved company to be changed into one
presenting work in the contemporary techniques at that time coming from
America.
As she grew into her 90s she would watch with fascination and approval those
works whose aesthetic technique was so different from that in which she had
been raised. This was a woman who had witnessed the outcry at the opening of
Stravinsky's Rite of Spring and had come to see it accepted as a modern
masterpiece. Proud as we are of our past, we must be equally caring of our
present and nurturing of our future. The new and the strange are not always
beguiling, but we would be failing in our duty if we ignored them.
Prudence Skene is Chairman of the Arts Council's Advisory Panel for Dance

FT  21 AUG 93 / Arts: In memoriam . . . - Claire Frankel visits the
Holocaust museum
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLAIRE FRANKEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AT Washington's new Holocaust Memorial Museum I punched in my statistics for
a folded and numbered identity card like those the Jews had to carry. It
read 'Amalie Petranker, born 1930, Stanislawow, Poland: my two sisters and I
often attend Jewish community events, despite the undercurrent of tension in
Stanislawow. On Sundays, people would even throw stones at us as they go to
church.'
Amalie - my age and gender - became my emotional companion as I walked
through the exhibition, her life updated at various computer terminals. The
identity card brought the unimaginable - 11m dead - down to a personal
level.
I had not been impressed with the idea of a holocaust museum in America. It
felt wrong because the Holocaust did not happen there and a museum would
surely be more appropriately located in Europe or Israel. Other Americans
disagreed, arguing that many survivors live there; that American troops
liberated some of the death camps; that racial and ethnic prejudices are
also pretty strong in some parts of the US. And there was the unanswerable
fact that in no other country could the required Dollars 168m to build and
equip the museum have been raised privately.
The two-acre site was given by the federal government. Washington, national
repository of monuments and museums with tourists to match, is ideal. The
exhibition starts at the fourth floor and winds down. The visitor is hit at
the beginning with a massive photograph of American soldiers, frozen in
shock, staring at a pile of still-smouldering corpses at the Ohrdruf camp in
Germany. The story of the SS St Louis, its fleeing European Jews not allowed
to disembark in Florida, is extensively portrayed. Allied aerial photographs
of Auschwitz challenge the then US government's claim that it could not be
bombed. A children's Wall of Remembrance features tiles handpainted by
American schoolchildren giving their views of the Holocaust.
So why invest in a museum now? l can only answer, nearly 50 years later, if
not now, when? Many things set this museum apart. Its 'philosophical
rationale', stated in the 1979 Report of the President's Commission, was
that we have a moral obligation to remember this unique horror and to study
'the diseases particular to the 20th century which led to this monstrous
aberration'. It deals, uniquely with sanctioned, premeditated death, giving
over the top floor for study with a 20,000-volume library, photo, film and
video archives and a registry of Jewish Holocaust survivors. A learning
centre and a teachers resource centre are part of the on-going, mandatory
educational programme.
The architect, James Inga Freed of Pei Cobb Freed &amp; Partners, NY, fled
Germany at the age of nine and travelled back to the concentration camps and
ghettoes for inspiration. He has incorporated some of his strongest memories
into architectural metaphors. Guard towers clearly visible from the street
evoke Auschwitz; heavy steel bands are reminiscent of those reinforcing the
brick of the crematoria; bridges are uncomfortably glass-floored and sided
with silk-screened names of obliterated victims; stairs narrow as in the
perspective of rails leading to an arch reminiscent of the entrance to
Birkenau; an illuminated glass fissure juts across the Hall of Witness like
an earthquake.
It is not a comfortable, smooth building - purposely not. At the same time,
it is not kitsch either. Freed's reluctance to discuss the imagery has to do
with his wish for each visitor to see and take away personal impressions.
'The building must disturb as well as invite', says Freed. It confronts. It
triggers an empathetic response. Memorial also comforts. The six-sided Hall
of Remembrance in the forecourt, with its clear iconography, is at the end
of the tour a place for rest, contemplation, perhaps prayer.
The need to personalise has been met with stunning artifacts. You walk on
paving stones from the Warsaw ghetto, through one of the transporting
boxcars, across a bridge from the Lodz' ghetto which separated the
'contaminating' Jews from other people. You sit and listen to survivors talk
about a day in Auschwitz, adjoining a barracks complete with original bunks.
Particularly memorable is a three-storey room, entirely covered with 1500
photographs collected by a survivor of the Polish village of Ejszyszki,
founded in the 11th century. It was entirely wiped out in two killing days
by the Nazis in 1941. The faces are ordinary, of people living in a
community, feeding chickens, getting married, having a picnic.
When I left the museum, I punched in my ID. Amalie Pertranka died in
Treblinka concentration camp in 1943.

FT  21 AUG 93 / Arts: Dartington comes in from the cold - Antony Thorncroft
finds the Summer School begining to blow its own trumpet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Dartington International Summer School is edging shyly into the
spotlight. For years it has flourished as a discreet coming together of 400
committed music buffs, from enthusiastic amateurs keen to spend a week or
two among the big musical names, to sharp students wanting to make contacts
and catch the eye of the musical establishment, which from Stravinsky to
Britten to Berio has always supported Dartington with enthusiasm.
In the past the School was besotted with the very Dartington concept of the
right to fail - that the composers, musicians and singers gathered to create
new works, rediscover rarities, and polish established pieces should not be
subject to rigorous outside criticism. Dartington was the serious musicians'
idea of fun, and not for the real world.
That is changing. Dartington under its artistic director Gavin Henderson is
waking up to the fact that it can claim to be one of the largest music
festivals in the world, with well over a hundred performances during its
five-week season in addition to the thousands of classes, jam sessions and
solo music making. In the past the projects put together at Dartington often
had a successful after-life, but Dartington rarely enjoyed the credit.
For example 'The Juliet Letters', the creation of Elvis Costello and the
Brodsky Quartet, was refined at last year's Dartington. This year one of the
works licked into shape was the 'Ordo Virtutum', created by the medieval
abbess Hildegard of Bingen to entertain her nuns around 1200 and arguably
the oldest piece of music theatre to survive. It is already earmarked for
the 1995 Brighton Festival, of which Henderson just happens to be artistic
director.
The Dartington Summer School actually claims the Edinburgh Festival as its
parent. In the euphoria of the 1940s it was felt that Edinburgh should have
an educational role; and after a period at Bryanston, the summer school
moved to Dartington. Unfortunately it naturally became linked in the public
mind with the Dartington Trust, that idealistic creation of the inter-war
period which never quite created the new man but which spawned a progressive
school with an uncanny ability to make the tabloids.
The school has gone, although the Schumacher College promoting new age
philosophy thrives, and Dartington College, which provides the Summer School
with its facilities, is now the performing arts off-shoot of the University
of Plymouth. A new era has started in this idyllic setting in south Devon,
which with its landscaped lawns and 14th century buildings can rival
Glyndebourne in grace and beauty.
But the Summer School would not want to shake off the idealism of
Dartington. At this year's school the Hackney Youth Orchestra was in
residence, working up a performance of Holst's 'St Paul's Suite', a tribute
to Imogen Holst, part founder of the School.
There must be give and take at Dartington. Anyone can pay up to Pounds 580 a
week and expect some attention. They will be dragooned into the choir, which
this week performed Janacek's 'Glagolithic Mass', and can hope for some
personal advice from Nigel Osborne, Keith Tippett, Barrington Pheloung, or
Robert Tear, who all receive a fixed Pounds 300 a week for their
contribution. Most participants are the keenest of amateurs, students, or
young professionals who want to play with the Medici String Quartet, or the
Brodsky, or the Schubert Ensemble.
Throughout the grounds music can be heard coming from bedrooms, studios, the
bigger halls, or even from soloists among the trees. It is all too committed
to seem escapist. Every evening there are three concerts and some tickets
are usually available for visitors in the neighbourhood. Any music lover
doomed to a beach holiday should think of the south Devon coast and steal
away to Dartington in the evenings.
The School is opening up because it wants more money for scholarships and
for expansion. It is introducing dance and is considering widening its range
to take in the orchestral. At the moment it concentrates on the small scale
and devotes each of its five weeks to a dominating musical form, from early
music, to baroque, classical, romantic, and modern. There is a growing
emphasis on new works and next week around 30 composers are playing around
with ideas, some of which will live on through such projects as the Royal
Opera House's Garden Venture, which started at Dartington.
Business is beginning to show an interest, notably Audi, which sponsors an
International Conductors Class under Diego Masson. But Dartington is
unlikely to sell out to commerce. It is really seeking wider recognition as
the driving force behind the regeneration of British music and music making.

TWIN PILLARS TO DESERT STORM by Howard Teicher and Gayle Radley Teicher
William Morrow (New York) 418 pages, Dollars 23
HOWARD Teicher made the news in Britain a few months ago when he appeared on
television to say that as a White House staffer working in the Reagan
Administration he had seen classified documents referring to the alleged
involvement of Mark Thatcher in Middle Eastern arms deals. The full story of
what Mark Thatcher did or did not do has yet to be told, but meanwhile
Teicher has vented his spleen against the failings of US foreign policy in
the Middle East by publishing an informative and entertaining book of
personal memoirs.
The aim of Teicher's book is to illustrate what he terms America's flawed
vision in the region going all the way back to President Richard Nixon.
Indeed it was Nixon, together with Henry Kissinger, who first codified the
notion of access to Gulf oil as a strategic interest for Washington. It was
also under Nixon that US policy adopted the so-called 'twin pillars'
strategy of using Saudi Arabia and Iran (under the Shah) as the twin
gendarmes of US interests in the region.
Teicher writes initially from the boiler room of US policy, having spent
time in the Pentagon and State Department before joining the White House as
a staffer for Bud McFarlane, the hapless national security adviser to
President Reagan who was ultimately forced out of office over the
Iran-Contra scandal. But Teicher makes crystal clear that when the Shah went
and Ayatollah Khomeini arrived in 1979, the US suffered a trauma that has
conditioned its policy ever since.
The book is at its best in explaining the disorder, even chaos in the Reagan
White House, and how the tilt to Saddam Hussein grew out of the simplistic
idea that Iraq could supplant the Shah as the new second 'pillar' in the
region. Teicher is not gentle with the Reagan Administration, and his
portrait of the pro-Iraqi Caspar Weinberger, the Secretary of Defence, shows
a man with tendencies verging on the amoral.
The book contains several revelations, especially how the US and Iraq worked
together in covert operations between 1983 and 1985 to overthrow Libya's
Colonel Gadaffi. Also of interest is the story of how the US pro-Iraqi tilt
had its origins with Zbigniew Brzezinski, national security adviser in the
Carter Administration.
Teicher's time in the White House, from 1982 to 1987, and his posts as
director for Near East and South Asia in the National Security Council and
then senior director for politico-military affairs - allowed him a ringside
seat during the formation of many US policies that would later lead to
trouble. His book is a useful contribution to the history of US Middle East
policy in the 1980s, which is still in need of a revisionist analysis that
takes one through the Bush years.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JACKIE WULLSCHLAGER

<TEXT>
MARY MAGDALEN by Susan Haskins HarperCollins Pounds 25, 518 pages
FOR OVER a thousand years, two images of women have dominated Christian
iconography: the Madonna and Mary Magdalen, the sinner turned saint. The
Virgin and the repentant whore, the inaccessibly pure and the fleshy, fallen
woman: they are at once archetypal male fantasies and emblems of the
Church's ideas about guilt, sin and desire, and its equation of sexuality
with morality. For centuries, these images conditioned how women were taught
to see themselves, and their importance in the collective female psyche can
hardly be overestimated.
But who was Mary Magdalen? Donatello sculpted her as a gaunt ascetic; Titian
made her a sensual beauty; in Martin Scorsese's film The Last Temptation of
Christ she is a sexy seductress. She is so rich a symbol that every society
has adapted her to its own prejudices. Power politics, theological deceit,
sexual repression and revolution have all played a part in her myth. It is
this story, with its compelling lesson in the relativity of cultural
perception, that is the subject of Susan Haskins' book.
Mary Magdalen of the Gospels is a follower of Jesus and prime witness of the
Resurrection. But early teaching confused her with the anonymous prostitute
in Luke; by the Middle Ages she had become the sinner's saint and most
favoured icon of a religion obsessed with guilt and death. Condemned
prisoners prayed to her and the bell tolled after a hanging was called 'la
maddalena' in Italy. In reference to her tearful regret, the word maudlin, a
medieval French pronunciation of her name, entered English. Monks stole her
bones as relics and prostitutes celebrated her name-day.
Her biblical role was meanwhile minimised: one medieval scholar claimed a
woman was the first to see the risen Christ because she would be sure to
chatter and gossip, thus inadvertently spreading His Word. Susan Haskins
suggests that a female sinner well suited the patriarchal Church; a bishop
who questioned the Magdalen's role as repentant whore was promptly
excommunicated. Renaissance humanists rescued her, depicting her as a sort
of Christian Venus. Titian, asked why a fasting hermit should look as lovely
as his image, replied that he painted her on the first day of her penance,
when she was still plump and luscious.
By the 19th century, the fallen woman was back in vogue. Zola, Massenet,
Rossetti, created femmes fatales called Madeleine who were powerfully sexual
but immoral and doomed. Men from Gladstone to Dickens were obsessed with
repentant prostitutes, known as 'magdalens'. The Victorian line in pious
pornography, with women posed as semi-naked penitents, went to the heart of
the enduring attraction of Mary Magdalen: spiritual love locked in erotic
longing, religious and sexual fantasy, the saint and the libertine, have
always gone together in the unconscious mind.
This book is full of delights, anecdotes, observations; it exhibits a wealth
of scholarship, and I was glad to have read it. But it is also seriously
flawed. The prose rambles unforgiveably ('Mary Magdalen's image also reached
the foggy British damps of wild, ancient Northumbria'). Vast scope means
lack of depth - thinkers from St Jerome to Foucault are parrotted in a few
lines. Most damagingly for a scholarly work, Ms Haskins cannot decide
whether she is writing cultural history or contributing to it, as she seems
to do in her assumption that the Mary Magdalen of the Gospels is the 'true'
character and in her recommendation of an updated, independent and active
Magdalen to 'serve women better as a symbol for today'.
This makes the book weak and inconsistent, and shuts the door on any attempt
to analyse the psychological need or meaning of myths. Haskins never matches
the critical judgment and perception of Marina Warner's model book in this
area, the study of the Virgin Mary cult, Alone Of All Her Sex. And yet -
because Haskins is, at heart, a partisan rather than a cultural commentator,
her book has a passion and charm which are hard to resist.

FT  21 AUG 93 / Books: Doomed, but driven to confess - Anthony Curtis takes
a look at the characters in William Trevor's stories

WILLIAM TREVOR: THE COLLECTED STORIES Penguin Books Pounds 9.99, 1,261 pages
EXCURSIONS IN THE REAL WORLD by William Trevor Hutchinson Pounds 16.99, 201
pages
THERE IS a deep unease that comes from reading William Trevor's fiction. It
causes one to be as glad to put down one of his novels or stories as one was
to pick it up. The reason for this is that people in whom he is interested
are doomed. There is no way out for them. None at all.
Being an Irish Protestant, his fiction is not priest-ridden like that of
Brian Moore, but that only makes the guilt from which his people suffer the
more immovable. His characters long to confess their guilt. They do so not
in the darkness and secrecy of the confessional, but out loud at a social
gathering or at a party. Often to a total stranger.
Inevitably such confessions tend to fall on ears that if not deaf are
bewildered. The recipient of the confession becomes defensive, or in some
other way hopelessly inadequate in response to the enormity of what is being
uttered to him or her. He can give momentary sympathy, or some kind of
practical help - like, say, the offer of another drink - to the sufferer;
what it is beyond his power to do is to grant him any lasting cure or
absolution.
The appearance of William Trevor: The Collected Stories on September 2
reveals the ubiquitous presence of these guilt-haunted individuals right
from the beginning. It was in the 1960s that Trevor's stories started to
appear in places like The London Magazine and The Listener. His first book
of stories, with its title-story The Day They Got Drunk On Cake, appeared in
1967, and Trevor was at once hailed by reviewers as a wizard in his handling
of this difficult form. He rapidly emerged as the successor to Maugham and
in Ireland to Sean O'Faolain.
Doom was everywhere in his early tales. There was the ex-RAF-man, now a
driving instructor whose pupil has crashed the car, drowning his sorrows
over several pints with a former colleague ('The Introspections of JP
Powers'); the elderly baby-sitter who finally becomes the baby ('In At The
Birth'); the schoolboy who in 'A School Story' announces his intention to
murder his father and step-mother. Most haunting of all was 'The Sins of
Edward Tripp'.
In this key story Edward T. is racked by guilt at having mercilessly teased
his sister when they were children. Now in middle age they live together.
Neither has married. Emily has her revenge on Edward by engulfing him in a
compulsive fantasy; she insists that each of their neighbours has, one after
another, been murdered. After each outburst Edward is forced to ring the
neighbour's bell and show her the person in the flesh to stop Emily's
raving. When Emily declares that Mrs Mayben has been killed 'in cold blood',
Edward decides to liberate himself from this intolerable situation by
confessing its root-cause to this woman when he enters her house.
It does not work out like that at all and the scene in which to her growing
horror Edward forces his confession upon the lady is typical of the
agonisingly hilarious tragi-comedy that is Trevor's trademark.
All these stories were England-based, as was Trevor when he wrote them. In
the later stories, masterpieces such as 'Attracta' and 'Beyond The Pale', he
returned to Ireland where he used his skill to reveal guilt not simply as
the product of individual fantasy but as the stuff of history. Although
Trevor has only rarely applied his gift for dialogue and incisive
character-sketching to the stage play, he has adapted several of these later
stories as plays for radio and television where they have proved extremely
effective in performance.
When he first began to experiment with the story-form Trevor was working in
London as an advertising copy-writer. Hitherto he has been reticent about
his own life but in Excursions in the Real World he breaks his silence about
himself. He is highly entertaining about his days in Hill Street, W1 and its
surrounding hostelries. There are tiny glimpses of colleagues who later
ceased to write copy and became poets or critics like Peter Porter, Edward
Lucie Smith, but the major portrait here in 'A Public House Man' is of one
Marchant Smith, a great copy-writer in his day and Trevor's immediate boss.
Trevor grew up in the 1930s in the seaside town of Youghal where his father
was a bank clerk. He describes his early education among nuns as almost the
only Protestant boy in the convent school; then less happily at Sandford
Park and St Columba's in Dublin. The author of The Old Boys is charitable
but penetrating about his earliest teachers. He suggests that frequent
visits to the cinema made a more lasting impact on his mind than the formal
instruction.
The sketches dealing with his youth in Ireland and period in the London of
the 1960s are more memorable than the later pieces on Venice, Stockholm, the
Ticino, New York, San Francisco and the brief appreciations of Yeats,
O'Casey, Beckett, Somerville and Ross. The overall mood is nonchalant, wry,
reflective: the style of a born raconteur whose timing is just a little too
perfect for his anecdotes to be completely spontaneous - but make no
mistake, they remain utterly riveting.

SECULAR VOCATIONS by Bruce Robbins Verso Pounds 34.95/Pounds 11.95, 288
pages
RECENT YEARS have seen a spate of books on the subject of intellectuals and
their place in society. Some are hostile; John Carey in his recent
Intellectuals and the Masses launched a swingeing attack on intellectuals,
alleging crimes ranging from snobbery to Fascism in their attitudes to less
literary folk. Others debate the political responsibility of intellectuals,
yet others the alienation of intellectuals from society, either because they
are disgusted by its philistinism, or because society fails to recognise
their value.
In this book Bruce Robbins joins the debate, but with a particular aim in
view. 'The near total absorption of intellectual life by the universities,'
say some critics, 'marks the decline, if not the obliteration, of the
'intellectual' as a social type.' Others add, 'Today non-academic
intellectuals are an endangered species.'
The point is that intellectual life has been increasingly professionalised
in the 20th century. It has turned into a job; in fact, a university job.
This means that intellectual activity has become specialised and
compartmentalised, and the compartments do not communicate. Not only is
there little contact between academic specialisms, but - worse - there is
little between the academy and the surrounding society. This means that
society has lost the benefit of having independent critics in its midst,
publicly leavening the general debate by their oblique perceptions and their
powers of opposition.
The answer Robbins gives these critics is uncompromising. It is that there
is nothing amiss with the academic professionalisation of intellectual life.
He argues that such terms as 'professionalisation' and 'specialisation'
mislead us, serving as terms of art in the argument of those who seek to
establish that there are no intellectuals left. But his intention is clear.
It is to protect the claim of university academics to be the continuers of
the intellectual tradition.
Robbins proceeds by exploring the interplay of culture and theory, the
transformation of the academies, and examples - afforded by Edward Said and
Raymond Williams - of intellectuals embodying 'the meaningful life', in
these two cases by working in 'exemplary fashion' both inside and outside
the academy. But as the book unfolds one sees that Robbins' prime interest
is the status of the academic literary critic, and a dismaying feeling grows
that the debates he reports are merely the internal squabbles of a breed of
professors anxious about their role. Academic literary critics have come to
see themselves as cultural commentators, and as usurpers of the traditional
position of the philosopher in society as critic and shaper of ideas. It is
ironic therefore that they do so in a manner, and in a language, unappealing
if not incomprehensible to the public whose applause they seek.
Robbins' view, roughly put, is that intellectuals are alive and well in the
academy. I only partially agree. I think they are alive and well outside it
too: in the media, arts and theatre, in the professions, Civil Service and
City. A measure of this is the surprisingly wide readership that exists for
serious newspapers and books, and the discriminating audiences that fill
theatres and concert halls every night. It is a pretension to think that
ideas are only taken seriously in universities. If anything, in the current
climate of demoralisation and dismantling of the universities, new ideas and
genuinely radical criticism are far more likely to come from the pub than
the academy.
As this implies, academics and intellectuals are not co-extensive groups.
There are many non-intellectuals in university posts, narrow clerks of
learning whose juices, if ever they flowed, have run dry. Of course,
scholarly excellence is the essence of academic work. But one wishes to see
imagination and creativity in addition, and an alert sense of the
contribution that the recondite can make to the everyday. Such gifts are
sometimes lacking in the academy, and nothing Robbins says convinces me
otherwise.
By contrast, the social debate at large is flourishing. What we should
therefore seek is a reunion of the best in both the academy and the wider
bazaar of ideas. One way of doing so is to open university doors. Why should
members of the public not attend lectures and seminars? Why should
universities not invite more playwrights and painters to lecture? Why should
companies and the Civil Service not give their staff paid sabbaticals to go
(back) to university, to return refreshed and full of ideas? Such
developments would help remove altogether the necessity for hand-wringing
over the nature and status of intellectuals in society.

<TEXT>
SWAHILI ORIGINS by James de Vere Allen James Currey(UK)/Ohio Univ. Press
Pounds 35/Pounds 12.95, 272 pages
THE WORLD OF THE SWAHILI by John Middleton Yale Pounds 19.95, 254 pages
THE SILLY season offers a once-a-year opportunity for literary pages to
catch up on books which would otherwise be ignored. James de Vere Allen's
Swahili Origins is an example. It deserves the attention not just of the
African academic but of the historically-aware FT reader who may have an
interest in East Africa, because the Swahilis and their culture present one
of the more fascinating aspects of that part of the world.
Jim Allen was a famous Kenyan character, a scholar who founded the excellent
museum on Lamu Island and died young in 1990. John Middleton, a senior Yale
anthropologist, has nobly seen through the press the posthumous summation of
Allen's lifelong research.
That sounds boring. But this is the academic on the front line, and it is
fun to watch. There is a long-running argument about the Swahilis. Since 800
AD they have occupied a 1,500-mile stretch of coastal settlements and
islands from Somalia to Mozambique. There have never been more than
half-a-million of them, but they had - have - a remarkably sophisticated
culture (magnificent architecture; a beautiful and poetic language; complex
folk traditions). So who are they? The answer - the argument - lies in the
mix, the tension, between their African and Arabian roots.
Allen was never afraid to push his theories to the limit. He believed that
the Swahilis can be traced back, well before the Battle of Hastings, to the
imperial town of Shungwaya - 'one of the great enigmas of East African
historiography'. The snag is that Shungwaya has not been found; it ought to
be somewhere near Lamu, and it must have faded before 1500, but until the
archaeologists dig it up it will remain merely a legend and the critics will
continue to scoff.
It follows that Allen believed in an African essence to the Swahili
identity; this is disputed by other academics, who are entitled to point out
that a lot of this book is guesswork. As Allen retorts, let's have a better
hypothesis. Meanwhile, his book has all sorts of incidental details which
confirm the particular fascination of medieval history - we shall not easily
forget the Shungwaya ruler who fell from grace not because he deflowered the
Coast virgins (which was his princely right) but because he did so with his
big toe.
John Middleton, who has edited Allen, had earlier produced his own The World
of the Swahili. It is an interesting and accessible account of 'the people
of the Coast' until it drifts into material too heavily anthropological for
the amateur reader. These are both 'academic' books, but they are - both -
fascinating and very readable, especially on the beach at Malindi or Shela.

<TEXT>
IS THERE A CHURCH OF ENGLAND? by C H Sisson Carcanet Press Pounds 25, 308
pages
'What comes back is that every choice is wrong,
No action finished as it was conceived,
The body withered while the hope was strong;
No itch it suffered ever was relieved.'
(from C H Sisson's The Pattern, 1993, published by Enitharmon Press, Pounds
3.50).
SOME writers gain their glory from a single work, bursting into the
firmament like new suns. Others are like distant constellations; it takes
time to discern their complexities. We are often blinded by the glare of the
immediate.
Out of the glare, Charles Hubert Sisson has for five decades crafted a body
of writing which, without public commotion, is impressive in both range and
quality. The objects of his attention, the rational voice which underpins
his satirical, ironic style, establish him as a true and faithful heir to
the 18th century of Jonathan Swift and Samuel Johnson.
Now, in his 80th year, Carcanet has published Sisson's latest collection of
41 essays, spanning the last 40 years, under the rhetorical title Is There A
Church Of England? What Sisson really means is, is there a Church of England
worthy of the name? Not really, it seems: 'Not the truth of what is said, as
it seems to the speaker, but its acceptability to the largest possible
audience, has been the concern of many of those most prominent in the Church
. . . There used to be eternal truth; now, in the mouths of these
mis-leaders, there is only the contemporary.' The syntax, the firmness of
view and the certainty of belief are pure 18th century - as is the essay's
firm conviction that reason is the only guide.
When viewed as a whole, Sisson's work takes on the form of a cathedral which
has, over time, accumulated a chapel here, a gargoyle there, all of which
bring out the architectural immanence of the whole structure. His two novels
are acclaimed minor masterpieces. An Asiatic Romance, published in 1953 but
now out of print, is a wonderfully comic tale whose ancestor is Samuel
Johnson's Rasselas. Christopher Homm (1965), is a relentlessly bleak
dissection of a man, with a chronology that skilfully moves backwards, long
before Martin Amis tried the trick in his considerably more well-known
Time's Arrow.
But whether as translator, novelist, poet, literary critic or political
essayist, Sisson's central preoccupations - with religious belief and the
Yahoo-like nature of humanity - are ubiquitous. The temptation to draw
parallels with Swift are irresistible. Just as Swift uneasily combined his
relatively eminent role in the Establishment of his day with a frequently
expressed resentment at the whimsical nature of political power, so too has
Sisson experienced the vicissitudes of fortune at the heart of British
political life.
He ultimately took early retirement (in 1972) from the civil service, where
he had achieved the senior rank of under-secretary in the department of
employment. His successful career came to a fairly abrupt halt, following
disagreements with more senior functionaries.
But Sisson pooh-poohs the idea that somehow he missed out by not being a
full-time 'professional' poet or writer, that his having to commute every
day to his London office to support himself and his family may have
interfered with his creative writing. 'The idea that a poet is given an Arts
Council grant to spend a year or so just writing is rather odd. I am sure
that that is the worst thing that can happen. For me, poetry doesn't 'take
time' in that sense. It just happens.'
Sisson's work is steeped in a cocktail of a form of Tory political thinking
which is now all but extinguished by Thatcherism; a high Church of England
theology; and a jaundiced view of humanity. His poem 'The London Zoo', first
published in 1961, is redolent of TS Eliot's The Wasteland. It's a bitter
commentary on the suburban commuters whose lot he shared each day on his way
to his bureaucrat's niche in Whitehall: 'Mr Axeter's office is designed
theologically;/ Upstairs there is one greater than he;/ Downstairs there are
several he must keep in submission/ Who profess they are doing what should
be done.'
Yet Sisson does not exempt himself from castigation: 'And who am I, you may
ask, thus to belly-ache/ At my betters? I tell you, I am one of the same
lot,/ - Without lobster and limousine, but, like the rest,/ Expending my
best energies on the second-best.'
No doubt the latest collection of essays will be dismissed as antediluvian,
anachronistic, out-of-touch with the current world. The paradox is that
Sisson would not disagree with such judgments, since to fall into line with
unreflecting fashion is precisely what his work portrays as a grave human
error.
He is a man who, now tucked away with his wife in a remote Somerset village,
has never possessed that great dispenser of fashion, a television set. 'This
business over the transporting of Bosnian children to this country is
ludicrous. A person with a television camera can sway the whole world, which
is absurd. Mr (John) Major, who is not known for his humaneness, then falls
into line. If all your attention is forced into following events elsewhere,
then you can easily forget that you have neighbours closer at home. You end
up ignoring things at hand. The notion that a committee of international
diplomats can decide what some poor chap with a gun will do is nonsense.'
That is a voice remarkably out of kilter with received wisdom. What gives
that voice authority is the intellectual strength that runs throughout his
writing. Marked out by the Whitehall establishment as being sufficiently
disaffected not to have deserved the customary honour due his rank, his
literary achievements were recognised in unusual fashion in June this year.
He was made a Companion of Honour, a gesture which would have tickled
Swift's sense of the absurd quirkiness of fortune.
Age has not withered Sisson; his impulsion to write seems as strong as ever.
It matters deeply to him that humanity not be swept into the maelstrom of
transient tragedies, here today but superseded tomorrow. His core
preoccupation in political, theological or poetic contexts, is the
destruction wrought on humanity by the massification of culture, spurring on
the splintering of society into disconnected shards. The constellations most
worth exploring, suggests his writing, are those within ourselves and our
consciences.

IN THE cold pre-dawn of next Wednesday, a queue will start to form outside
an undistinguished building in downtown Boston. A line of well-heeled women
will pay homage to one of the biggest days of the US shopping season - the
Bridal Event at Filene's Basement.
This is no ordinary sale. The queue is expected to include not only bargain
hunters who take the first T-subway from Alewife or Harvard, but seriously
rich customers who stroll over to Filene's from the Ritz Carlton, where they
checked in after flights from New York.
Shoppers with some of the highest credit ratings in the country will be
waiting patiently for a genuine bargain. Inside, assistants will be putting
the final touches to more than 800 wedding dresses with famous labels such
as Saks Fifth Avenue, Dior and Bloomingdales.
Normally none of these dresses would sell for less than Dollars 1,000, and
most for much more. Next week they will each sell at Dollars 199. The finer
trappings of buying haute couture - a calm atmosphere and deferential staff
 -will be abandoned at 8am when the doors open.
The basement - 60,000 sq ft of space on two subterranean levels - is an
institution with all the reserve and panache of the Colosseum in ancient
Rome. The customers are following a grand tradition. In 1940, 15,000 women
stormed the store after it purchased the last dresses to leave the Paris
boutiques before the German occupation. More recently, 18 shoppers flew from
New York to attend a Dollars 1.3m fur sale.
On an average day up to 20,000 people visit Filene's Basement, the
independent off-shoot of the larger and more refined Filene's department
store. That volume of traffic allows the store - taken private by a
management buy-out in 1988 and refloated in 1991 - to sell brand names such
as Brooks Brothers, Lord &amp; Taylor and Pierre Cardin at savings of up to 80
per cent off the original prices.
The returns are rich. The basement has taken Dollars 2.39m in a single day's
trading; in 1991 its annual one-day sale of men's suits grossed more than
Dollars 1m. The scale of its turnover, involving up to seven truck loads' of
stock every day, makes the performance of some London stores look modest.
The store has a unique attraction - the automatic markdown plan, under which
merchandise carries a price tag listing the date the item was first offered
for sale. After 14 days the price is cut by 25 per cent; further cuts are
made after 21 and 28 days. If the item remains unsold after 35 selling days
it goes to charity.
You can spot markdown merchandise by the crowds four or five deep. Clothes
are thrown into wooden troughs, known as booths, where shoppers gather to
feed. They can buy Christian Dior dress shirts at Dollars 20; Rossinimoda or
Vittoria Ricci shoes at Dollars 69; Pierre Cardin jeans at Dollars 20;
Michael Laurence suits at Dollars 68.99 or splash out on a Gianpaulo
creation at Dollars 299.
The income generated by the plan has allowed the store to expand rapidly
with branches opening in Chicago, Washington DC and Minneapolis, and shortly
in Manhattan. Filene's Basement sees no need to come to Europe just yet
because Europeans are busy going the other way, scrummaging along with the
hardiest Bostonians. But shoppers be warned: passengers arriving in Britain
from the US may bring only Pounds 36 worth of goods home with them duty
free. Any items worth more are subject to duty of up to 20 per cent.
Undeclared goods are subject to much stiffer penalties, and sometimes
confiscation.
Filene's has more than enough stock to satisfy the appetite. There are
clothes and accessories on the selling floor worth Dollars 2.5m, and a
further Dollars 14m in the stock rooms. Next Wednesday, Basement general
manager Donald Scott is looking forward to big queues for the cash registers
and credit card machines. 'People spend thousands on their wedding but pride
themselves on cheap dresses,' says Scott. 'They even keep the tags to brag
about - it make us different from any other store in the world.'

enthuses over Bruce Cost's cooking in California / Restaurant Review
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEN HOM

<TEXT>
AS AN authority on Chinese cuisine I am always on the lookout for any good
Asian restaurants, Chinese or otherwise. Thus, I was delighted in 1989 to
discover Bruce Cost's San Francisco gem, Monsoon, shortly after it opened.
I was impressed by its imaginative and delicious offerings and my
experiences there, until it closed in 1991, only confirmed my original
judgment. Food critics and writers from all over America have joined me in
that consensus. Now Cost has moved to Berkeley, on the other side of the
Bay, to take over Fourth Street Grill which he has transformed into Ginger
Island. The delicious menu would give some of the best restaurants in Asia a
run for their money.
Bruce Cost, the proprietor and chef, is not of Asian descent. Nevertheless,
he has mastered the essences and subtleties of Asian cuisine as if he were a
native. Before Monsoon and Ginger Island, he had already established his
reputation as an accomplished chef, an expert on Asian cuisines. He began
his apprenticeship years ago in New York, under the guidance of Virginia
Lee, a fine cook. This soon led him to become a chef and cookery instructor.
When he moved to San Francisco, he found easy acceptance into the Bay Area
circle of cooks whose foremost member is Alice Waters, of Chez Panisse fame.
This group was influential in forming what is now popularly known as
California Cuisine, with its emphasis on freshness, colourful combinations,
imaginative reworking of classics and the creative blending of different
culinary traditions, the familiar and the exotic.
Alice Waters acclaims Cost as 'one of the greatest cooks I've ever known.' I
agree.
Cost is a fanatic on freshness of ingredients. He boasts that the only items
in his freezer are his frozen fruit ices, made on the premises. Every main
ingredient, from fish, seafood to meats and poultry, is delivered daily, in
the case of fish and seafood, usually live. Cost is an expert on Asian
spices and flavourings and uses only the best peanut oils, vinegars and soy
sauces.
Although specialities change daily, some popular favourites are almost
always available. My personal choices include Vietnamese spring rolls and
Ginger Island wontons. The spring rolls are a delicate and refreshing
combination of tastes and textures, crackling rice paper with a savoury
filling. The wontons are perfectly poached dumplings with a delectable pork
filling and a wonderful hot vinegar-ginger sauce. Equally good is the
alternative wonton choice filled with earthy Chinese green vegetables and
Chinese eggplant with ginger-sesame glaze, a northern Chinese inspired dish
which is served with either toast or croutons.
All his claypot dishes taste as if they come, freshly made, from a Chinese
home. One of my favourites is claypot of braised pork shoulder. Any
Shanghainese would serve it with pride. It is a fatty cut of pork that is
slowly braised in a master sauce until the fat has melted into a sweet
succulent savoury treat. It is then cooked with white radish. The
combination is what a Chinese like myself would always find memorable.
However, a clay pot of spare ribs with black bean sauce was
uncharacteristically bland and the meat tough.
Ginger Island's seafood is as good as you would find in any restaurant in
Hong Kong. A distinctive dish includes fresh clams, sea scallops and mussels
perfectly steamed and served in a delicate Thai lemongrass-ginger coconut
sauce. It has a slight bite balanced by the rich sweetness of coconut milk.
Shellfish can sometimes have a robust taste, but are rendered exquisite,
sweet and ethereal at Ginger Island.
There is usually a selection of fresh Asian vegetable dishes which reflects
the seasonal harvest of bountiful California. These may range from Chinese
broccoli to choy sum, a mustard green. All are prepared with skill and
frequently accompany the main dishes with a serving of Thai jasmine rice.
Asian cuisine is not noted for its dessert courses but Ginger Island offers
such original delights as fresh ginger cake, Ginger Island hot fudge sundae
and fruit sundae. This east-west collection of desserts changes daily, and I
have found the sweets delicious and refreshing. They are something in which
Cost excels.
The food can be enjoyed in a bright, contemporary and tropical atmosphere
and is served in a friendly manner. All this at affordable prices.
Ginger Island, 1820 Fourth Street, Berkeley, California. Tel: (510) 644-0444
(reservations advised). Credit cards: Visa and Mastercard, lunch and dinner.
Cost of a meal for two without wine is approximately Dollars 40.

FT  21 AUG 93 / Fashion: I know what I like in your wardrobe - The difficult
art of choosing your partner's clothes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIZ WALKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHRISTOPHER WATSON, ex-army officer and district councillor, loves choosing
and buying clothes for his wife, Anne. 'A man with a badly-dressed wife,' he
believes, 'is half to blame as he is not paying her enough attention.'
'Choosing clothes,' he says, 'is not that different from choosing curtains,
a car or a radio. If you see a half-dozen antique knives there will always
be one better than the others. But you need the eye to spot that one.
'I keep a chart of Anne's measurements in my wallet as sizing is not always
consistent. I used to like Hartnell when it was in London. Now I like the
Scotch House for sweaters and Rigby &amp; Peller for bathing costumes and
lingerie - my step-daughters are usually impressed with what I choose for
them. Then there is Harrods, The White House for dressing-gowns, and Marks
and Spencer is good for basics, although I always like to see the belts
replaced.'
Anne feels she is 'a country girl at heart' and is always 'rushing over the
fields in a felt hat. I don't seem to have the knack of dealing with scarves
or stoles. I don't mind Christopher helping me choose things as we have much
the same taste. It's rather fun; he goes to endless trouble and if there is
something I don't like I can usually wheedle my way around him.
'When I shop by myself I might bring several things home for him to look at.
If he comes with me and I do not choose anything he calls me a fool for
wasting his time.
'Where we differ is that I am rather more practical. He bought me a very
good cream coat that is hardly worn as I do not go to many race days any
more. One disaster was a pair of navy-blue shorts that came above my knee -
I felt stupid in them and so they had to go back.'
Christopher has strong views on style and feels that 'high fashion does not
do women any favours'. 'It gives me so much pleasure to choose things for
Anne, even though some people do think it's a little odd,' he says.
JAN Kilroy-Silk met her television presenter husband Robert when he was
still at school in Birmingham. Even then he was fashionable, wearing
hand-made white shirts with his regulation blazer and flannels. While she
was at art college, dressed in black from head to toe, Robert was parading
in an Italian suit with lilac tie, matching socks, and winkle-pickers.
It was not long before Jan took his wardrobe firmly in hand. She remembers
in particular 'a very nasty white sports coat that he wore, which I had the
bright idea of dyeing navy. Unfortunately, the thread stayed white.' He was
gradually subverted and went on to sport the chunky sweaters, cords and
Senior Service style favoured by university lecturers.
When Kilroy-Silk became a Labour MP he adopted suitable suits, tailored
under Jan's watchful eye. 'There was one pin-striped model that we used to
call my MP suit. Then, when I started the Kilroy Show, five mornings a week
on BBC1, I continued to wear suits but did not have time to visit tailors
for fittings. To begin with they wanted me to wear Frank Bough-type sweaters
but I didn't think that was quite me.'
Basically, says Jan, 'Robert hates shopping - except for books - although he
has definite ideas on what he likes. I usually go into Masons of Maidenhead
in Berkshire, pick out lots of things and then persuade him to come in and
try them on. He will buy about four or five suits at a time. He is a fairly
stock size but needs the waists taking in.'
Giorgio Armani and Hugo Boss are favourite designers for more formal suits
and ties, but Ralph Lauren checked shirts, cashmere sweaters and Levis are
the weekend look. 'I used to have about half a dozen cardigans all in bright
colours but I now prefer cashmeres in dark navy or maroon. I always change
into something more casual the minute I get in from town.'
Robert has not bought any clothes for his wife since he experimented with a
candlewick dressing-gown with a zip down the front ('if ever one's image
felt crushed . . . ,' says Jan) but feels that she always look smart and
sexy. 'I like her wearing classic Italian outfits. I am not keen on the
baggy Japanese look. I know what I like but would not know how to achieve
it.'
Carolyn Hadden-Paton, who owns and runs Sam Browne, a shop specialising
mainly in weekend clothes for City types, chooses nearly everything that her
husband, Alasdair, puts on.
Alasdair Hadden-Paton used to be a chartered accountant and then went into
the venture capital business (or, according to Carolyn, became an 'adventure
capitalist'). He has also, in partnership with David Neylor-Leyland,
recently opened two up-market 'bed and breakfast' hotels in London.
'When Alasdair and I first met I was working as a buyer of women's clothes
in Patsy Seddon's first Phase 8 shop, while Alasdair was still at school,'
says Carolyn. 'Our relationship nearly ended on our first date when he
arrived wearing a jeans-jacket, cowboy boots and jeans that were far too
tight. His sister-in-law worked in the Midnight Blue store and he probably
got a discount.
'The first thing I bought for him was a pair of bathing shorts from Douggie
Hayward, the tailor. He now has 10 pairs in his wardrobe. But when we were
first a couple we never went clothes shopping together. He was dressed by
his mother from Marks and Spencer and, as he is rather ape-like, had his
shirts made in either Hong Kong or Cyprus, where his brother was stationed.
Mufti wear tended to be the too-tight jeans.'
Now Carolyn chooses and buys all Alasdair's clothes, from double-seamed
jersey boxer shorts, ankle-length dressing-gowns ('I don't want to see hairy
legs over my morning muesli'), bright cord trousers with pleated fronts,
brushed cotton shirts to tailor-made business suits. 'Luckily,' she says,
'he is incredibly easy to dress. I don't know what I would do if I had a
husband with tiny little legs.'
Alasdair buys his classic shirts from Thomas Pink in London and his ties
from Yves St Laurent or Hermes, as Sam Browne's wonderful Italian silk ties
tend to be snapped up by customers as soon as they arrive.
'He is a perfect house model, and I frequently make him try things on for
me. When he goes golfing at the weekend with his men friends they are always
asking him where his clothes come from. He is a very good advertisement for
my shop.'
Mark Leatham's office in Camberwell, south east London, gives you some clues
to both his business and his private passions. There are glass cases full of
stuffed birds, a Welsh dresser loaded with cans of olive oil, enormous
packets of exotic coloured spaghetti, a 2ft cigar and acres of paperwork.
His main business, Leathams Larder, sells dry goods to specialist shops. He
also supplies quail to the multiples and game and fish to private clients.
'When I was in the army in my younger days,' says Mark, 'I was a bit of a
peacock and wore suits made by my old Etonian tailor and shirts from
Turnbull &amp; Asser. I was always correctly dressed in the right kit. My prep
school headmaster said I was the most immaculate boy he had met during his
30 years there.'
Jojo Leatham met her husband after he had left the army and was setting up a
game-supplying business with his brother. Although he was very good looking,
his sartorial elegance had vanished. 'He wore very tight trousers, never
wore underpants, and rarely wore socks,' she says. 'The worst T-shirt I ever
remember him wearing said 'Horny Toad' on the front. I thought, 'nice body,
shame about the clothes.''
Mark soon realised that the rest of his management team was looking very
smart and that it was time to polish his image. 'My priorities had changed;
I was no longer a batchelor who had to flaunt his peacock feathers; I had
caught my bird. I had to go out and look functional, not too flash or
trendy, although I like ties to be a bit off-beat. I leave the designer
suits to my younger brother, Quentin. However, I do like pink: I feel the
colour softens me up a bit.'
His blazer was 'built' by his old school tailor in 1987 and still has his
regimental buttons. Most of his shirts come from Thomas Pink, and his
country ones are by Johnny Boden. Gone are the tight white Midnight Blue
jeans, replaced at weekends in Oxford by plus-fours for shooting or bright
coloured cords from Hackett, bought quite frequently as Jojo has a tendency
to shrink them in the washing machine. 'I don't consider dressing-up to be
important and I wouldn't appreciate cashmere - cut-price Shetlands from
Scotland are more the thing two years into a recession, especially with a
brace of children. I like to buy Jojo the odd silk shirt when I go to
Paris.'
Mark still thinks of clothes as an extravagance and at least twice a year
Jojo has to restock his wardrobe with necessities such as underwear, shirts
and ties. Without her, she thinks, he would 'just carry on wearing whatever
had, regardless of the state it was in. If he really had his way, he would
go round in scruffy old corduroys looking like the gardener.'

FT  21 AUG 93 / Gardening: Climbers which make an impression
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN LANE FOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THIS sudden week of heavenly weather, an image of the painter Monet keeps
returning to my mind. At this moment, the nasturtiums must be flowering
along the path of his garden at Giverny, in France, recently recreated for
visitors. Perhaps there are still some water lilies, and possibly the
agapanthus are as good as mine and almost as good as the most valuable
agapanthus in the world, which Monet painted in his 80s and which now hangs
in the basement of the Marmottan in Paris.
It is not for these reasons, however, that I am thinking of him. He used to
say that nothing else in the world interested him except his painting and
his flowers. I have moments of envying his nerve in saying this, and rather
more moments of reminding myself why I disagree. Then, I look at the
newly-built arches in my garden and picture him again, the patron saint of
arch-building, which has continued to be a craze after his death.
At Giverny, above the nasturtiums, the managers have reinstated wide arches
for their roses (the colours of some are better than others). Monet himself
first added these arches to his garden's metalwork in 1891 when he was 51. I
am pleased to discover that he painted them a bright and leafy shade of
green. My arch-builder painted mine in my absence and did not forewarn me
that he was thinking on Monet-coloured lines. I had expected something
darker, but the grass-green is already fading gently and I can tell myself
that I now have a true Impressionist colour, chosen carefully for all
Monet's arches, shutters and woodwork.
Nowadays, many companies will sell you arches in sections and some will even
send adequate notes on how to assemble them. I have always found it cheaper
to hire a local blacksmith and buy any materials from him. I have also hired
a friend's trained metalworker, who saved me the aggravation of erecting an
Agriframe and put up my arches instead.
They went up in June and I think they are the reason non-gardeners are so
sure that, this year, the garden has taken a great leap forward. Quietly,
they have been waiting for me to go Sloane. They would be even more
impressed if only I could decide what to put on them.
Sometimes, readers send me a good idea: you first sent me the
yellow-flowered clematis for the hot south wall and the best red rose,
Etoile de Hollande, for a wall facing east. We all know about arches of
laburnum, which look spectacular if you use the vossii variety. We also know
about wisteria, and it is now worth studying The Plant Finder for the best
whites, the Chinese form called Caroline, Black Dragon, and the others which
I used to think had disappeared. I find that the lovely Multijuga variety is
too much on a normal arch because its wonderfully long flowers dangle for
several feet and close it off.
Fewer people know about the Judas Tree, which will also cover an arch. It
flowers sparsely, but its leaves are pretty and can be eaten in salads early
in summer.
Otherwise, if you want to be showy and original, where should you look?
On my dry, stony soil, it is no use relying only on roses: they grow
wretchedly and develop black spot by midsummer. On happier soils, I still
think that the pale pink-white New Dawn is in a class by itself on an
archway. In general, I prefer repeat-flowering climbers with big flowers to
the rampant, once-flowering ramblers which are recommended most often.
I prefer anything to the newish, pink Sophies Perpetual. I find its colour
beastly and I am struggling to stop its harsh flowers from appearing
throughout the year. Mrs Herbert Stevens is a lovely double white and, in
sunny, sheltered places, my beloved apricot, Lady Hillingdon, is excellent
because her flowers tend to droop and thus appear through the ceiling of the
arch.
What, though, if roses dislike you, or you wish to vary the scene?
I am sure of one thing which Monet never knew. The outstanding clematis on
an arch is Perle d'Azur, which is at its best now and is so wonderfully
vigorous that it will thrive and flower unstoppably.
Otherwise, where do we look? In mild gardens or expatriate bunkers, I would
go straight for the lovely white Solanum jasminoides, but it will not
survive hard winters in open ground on a British arch.
White jasmines in Britain are usually rather scruffy, with more leaf than
flower. I could live with an entire arch of honeysuckle, but most of them
will not live with anything else because they throttle it and reduce you to
their single season.
The better-behaved varieties, Dropmore Scarlet and the scented Graham
Thomas, are not at their best in full sunlight. The main point of an arch is
to cast shade in an over-exposed position: the climbers have to be able to
take full sun on their heads, and some of the honeysuckles will turn brown.
Passion flowers, golden hops and Chinese gooseberries are all a mess. After
studying lists of climbers, I am inclined to abandon them and consider
training and pruning particular trees. At Kiftsgate Court, in
Gloucestershire, the rose garden is rounded off by a fine arch of
whitebeams, trained together and clipped hard. At Greys Court near Henley,
Oxfordshire, you can see an airy arch of pink-flowered acacias. Hazels are
worthy, but very dull.
My present thought is that the neglected staphylea might be the answer for
those who want a change. It carries hanging bunches of white flowers, in its
better forms, and it comes at that awkward moment in late May. I will report
on progress.
Monet, I suspect, would say that the answer was obvious and the correct
decision is to plant more wisterias. They grew to look superb on his wide
Japanese bridge. Somehow, though, I do not wish to be obvious and will
probably live to regret it: hold fast for news of a staphylea, unless you
come up with a better idea.

FT  21 AUG 93 / Property: Yorkshire grit will out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERALD CADOGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WE NEED Yorkshire determination, I have often thought this summer when
'carry on failing' became the motto of the English cricket team. It is wise
to buy a house there. If Yorkshiremen built it, it will not collapse.
The large county, soon to be re-arranged yet again, has something for
everyone. Industry and farming work side by side. It is easy to escape from
a day at the mill to walk on the moors or in the dales. Edward Waterson, of
estate agent Carter Jonas in York, says it sells two out of three houses in
country areas to outsiders. Many come to work in Leeds, take to the life of
North Yorkshire and quickly want to stay for good.
Yorkshire is packed with places for expeditions, from spas to fishing ports
such as Whitby with its unaltered, box-pewed church, complete with a pew for
'fallen women.' Palaces such as Vanbrugh's Castle Howard and Carr's Harewood
House show how country houses took over the dominant role in the rural
economy that Yorkshire's great abbeys - Fountains, Rievaulx, Selby and
Bolton - enjoyed until Henry VIII dissolved them.
Roman York (Eboracum) was Britannia's second city and in the Yorvik centre,
beneath York's Coppergate shopping precinct, the pioneer of the now
fashionable 'time cars' resurrects the Vikings, following the old idea of
end-of-pier ghost trains. Centuries later, the grand public buildings and
factories of Sheffield, Leeds and Bradford symbolised the industrial
revolution. The University of York, a 1960s' foundation, is a leader in the
subject of conserving historic buildings.
Waterson says July was Carter Jonas's best month for several years in terms
of offers for houses. The momentum has carried into August. But Tim Blenkin,
of Blenkin &amp; Co. - Knight Frank &amp; Rutley's associate in York - is cautious,
noting that some houses are still over-priced compared with what the same
money will buy in Gloucestershire or Sussex.
Why? 'People have deep pockets in Yorkshire, and are cannier with their
money,' he says. 'There have not been the business repossessions or Lloyd's
disasters, as in the south. People are not aware of how bad things have
been. But we still have some teaching to do - that buyers want value.'
Vendors holding out for late-1980s' prices are unlikely to achieve a sale.
At Wagwood House in Sheffield, with eight acres, faith and commonsense were
rewarded. Bagshaws sold it by auction for Pounds 535,000 after bidding began
at a modest Pounds 200,000.
High on the North Yorkshire moors, Rigg End at Hartoft, near Pickering, has
41 acres, superb views down the valley of the river Seven and fishing on the
river. It is on offer from Rounthwaite &amp; Woodhead or Jackson-Stops at Pounds
425,000, down from Pounds 450,000 in June.
In Malhamdale Scalegill, near Skipton, there is a converted mill deep in the
valley, with three cottages (for holiday lets) and two turbines which could
be restored to provide power. Blenkin asks for offers over Pounds 400,000.
Meanwhile, Longside House at Ramsgill-in-Nidderdale, high up the daleside,
is available from GA for Pounds 325,000.
Savills is selling three houses at Pounds 325,000. One is a horsey property,
Holden House Farm at Upper Batley, near Leeds. It has 11 loose boxes and is
two miles from the M62 for escaping to Lancashire.
The second is Woodclose House, at Pateley Bridge, between Ripon and
Harrogate. The garden and garden wall, with battlements and turret, overlook
Nidderdale. The third is Long Marston Hall, 17th century and listed Grade
II, where either Cromwell or Fairfax (on the parliamentary side) had their
headquarters before the battle of Marston Moor in July 1644.
The 14th century Farnhill Hall also has a military link. It is a peel, or
fortified, house with four towers at each corner of a great hall, built on
high ground for protection against the Scots. In need of some work, it is
listed Grade I and priced at Pounds 350,000 from Westlake.
Fellbeck Old Hall is more ancient still. It is a dales farmhouse of about
1260 which still has its cruck timbers and remains in fine condition. It
used to belong to the monks of Fountains Abbey and has 25 acres and farm
buildings. The house, at more than Pounds 450,000 from Cluttons, faces
towards the strange formations of Brimham Rocks.
For the 17th-cum-early-20th century Hanlith Hall, near Kirkby Malham,
Cluttons asks Pounds 750,000; this includes a 501-acre let farm and an
indoor swimming pool, sauna and solarium. It seeks offers over Pounds 1m for
Scale House, near Skipton, with its 772 acres (376 of them let), pheasant
shoot, and quarry with fossils that is a site of special scientific
interest. For that price, an alternative is Strutt &amp; Parker's Skewkirk Hall,
near York.
In the hamlet of Street, in Great Fryup Dale near Whitby, Street Farm is a
1749 yeoman farmhouse in stone (from Jackson-Stops; price Pounds 155,000).
Normanby Hill, on rising ground at Sinnington in the Vale of Pickering,
first went on the market at Pounds 350,000 in 1990. Now, Blenkin is asking
around Pounds 200,000, reflecting a need for repair as well as the decline
in the market.
Further information from agents in York: Blenkin (0904-671 672); Carter
Jonas (0904-627 436); Jackson-Stops (0904-625 033); Savills (0904-620 731).
Agents in Harrogate: Cluttons (0423-523 423); GA (0423-530 700); Strutt &amp;
Parker (0423-561 274). Agents elsewhere: Rounthwaite &amp; Woodhead, Malton

FT  21 AUG 93 / Sport: Troubling the scorers - Cricket
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERESA MCLEAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THIS YEAR our most traditional sport is trying out some modern machinery.
The Test and County Cricket Board hopes that this will make management of
the game easier and perhaps help to earn, or at least save, money. The least
I could do was try to understand. As an admirer of those treasure-houses of
information known as scorebooks, I headed for the new computerised scoring
system which has replaced scorebooks in first-class cricket this season.
I can see the logic behind using a third umpire, with access to television
re-plays, to help with difficult run-out decisions. I think it has drawbacks
and dangers, but there is a logic. The motive for computerised scoring is
less obvious, except the unworthy one of centralising scores, which are fed
directly and instantly into a score-bank throughout play.
This central bank, not the county ground, is now the axis of county cricket
scoring. Depressed by this thought, I asked various cricket officials about
the change, but the reasons they gave me seemed curiously unreal, part of a
mythological culture of progress.
At Chelmsford last weekend, where Essex were battling the Australians, a
friendly gentleman from the secretary's office was more than happy that I
should go and look at their new scoring machine because, he said: 'It's
progress, isn't it? We have to keep up with the times, don't we?'
'Why?'
'Everyone does.'
'Why?'
Apparently the answer in this case is statistics, which is a worthwhile
cause in cricket. Because cricket is what John Nyren described 160 years ago
as 'an elegant and scientific game', its statistics are both entertaining
and important. They are more than mere facts. They elucidate the game.
The Association of Cricket Statisticians is a collection of individuals who
delight in this. They study cricketing statistics of every kind -
historical, contemporary, personal, national, aesthetic. The association is
devoted to accuracy and was one of the first bodies to voice doubts about
the value of computerised scoring, in February, soon after the scheme was
announced.
Naturally enough, the TCCB had no such doubts. It joined forces with a news
agency and a computer company to install the scoring computers and feed a
mass of statistics into the mainframe in Yorkshire. From here statistical
information is instantly available to the media. The TCCB, keen to keep
cricket up to date, thinks this marks the end of slow and inaccurate match
scores in evening papers. I was glad to see the statisticians' association a
as sceptical as I am about this. It has found very few mistakes, almost all
insignificant, in years of intensive reading of papers' cricket pages.
The news agency, the Press Association, is keen to get the latest match news
without having to telephone reporters at grounds. It simply taps into the
mainframe. I am doubtful about that too. Scores alone are not enough for
readers, who would always prefer a write-up, if only a small one, to the
latest score in solitary splendour.
The computer company is the third party paying for the innovation. Among the
star statistics dominating the computer system are each bowler's and
batsman's averages, adjusted ball by ball, together with how many balls the
batsman has faced, in how many minutes - the list is huge. So huge, in fact,
that it was too much for the computers, which broke down under the pressure.
It takes more than standard software to soak up the glories of cricket.
The computer company has found its first season in the game a long, hard
struggle and company politics have inclined towards the Attila the Hun mode.
But with a new chairman and two new managers, it is hoping next year will be
better. It could hardly be worse, given that the machines were sent to
England by sea, not air, so they arrived late and the operators were late
getting the hang of them. When they did, the machines were not up to the
job.
Among the mechanical teething troubles has been the failure to produce
print-outs, so there is no open-page display of the details of play, such as
a scorebook presents. Instantaneous scoring stores facts but does not show
them as items in the game's development. Next season the computers are
expected to produce print-outs, which counties can consult, collect, bind
and store with their score-books or copy into their scorebooks.
Essex is one of the counties most proud of its rich written inheritance,
including treasures like scorebooks recording Charles Kortright's noblest
matches for his county. There is an irony in the computerised production of
match scores on paper to continue a hand-written tradition.
At Chelmsford the scorebox was not letting the latest changes get in its
way. It had a scoring computer and operator who, though busy, was very
friendly and tried to explain to me some of the machine's tangled
undergrowth of technology.
To the ignorant onlooker, the most obvious feature is a large circle which,
under instruction, can represent the ground and show where on the ground
each shot is hit. The screen also has a scattering of numbers, some still,
some changing, and a mass of hidden numbers.
'You have to know what it's doing,' the operator told me with a rueful
smile, 'It's 90 per cent for the media, not for the club.'
'Which is why I'm sitting here doing a record for the club,' said a lady
scorer, raising her hand to acknowledge the tired umpire's uplifted arms as
visiting opener Matthew Hayden warmed to his task. 'I'm doing one for
Australia,' said the Australian scorer.
Australian reporters dropped in from the press-box several times while I was
there, to check or get details of the score. They always went to a
scorebook, which they studied carefully, 'reading the game, lady.'
At times reflection is gentler than direct sight; at times, especially when
looking back, it can be more useful. Cricket scoreboxes offer both ways of
watching cricket. 'Reading the game' from score-books is too valuable a
reflective way of watching to be sacrificed to an empty cause like the one
which the TCCB spokesman described to me as 'taking the game into the 22nd
century.'

<TEXT>
TOYOTA'S new Supra is a Lexus among super-sports cars. A Lexus? Let me
explain. The Lexus LS400 is Toyota's prestige luxury saloon; a 4-litre,
V8-engined, top management car that by common consent is quieter than a
Rolls-Royce.
The Pounds 37,500 two-plus-two Supra has much of the urbanity of a Lexus as
well as being ultra rapid. Its twin turbocharged, 3-litre, straight-six
engine puts out 326 horsepower at 5,600 rpm and 90 per cent of that at only
1,300 rpm. When I drove it in Germany last week it was still accelerating
hard when the speed limiter cut in at 155 mph (250 kph). Without a limiter,
Toyota says, it would be good for a shade over 180 mph (290 kph).
Far more importantly, it cruised gently on country roads at one-third of
that speed. Pick-up was swift without changing out of top. But the effect of
dropping down to third and flooring the accelerator was like firing a gun.
Buyers are offered a six-speed gearbox, jointly developed by Getrag of
Germany and Toyota, or a four-speed automatic for the same price. Good
though the manual Supra is to drive, the two-pedal version is much better.
With an avalanche of power on tap from 2,000 to 5,000 rpm, who needs six
gears anyway? The smooth automatic lets you concentrate on enjoying the
Supra's peerless handling in the country and makes for greater relaxation in
town traffic.
Though it has far more power than any six-cylinder rival it is undemanding
to drive. A traction control system eliminates wheel spin when accelerating
and maintains the Supra's courtly manners on wet and slippery curves. The
Supra rides with much the same comfort as a sporty saloon because the
suspension is soft although heavily damped. Only very low speed driving in
former East Germany's down-at-heel villages made it feel harsh. The short
sidewalls of tyres less than half as high as they are wide cannot absorb the
shock of rolling over cobblestones that have not been relaid since the days
of horses and carts. Closest rivals of the Supra are the Nissan 300ZX
(Pounds 33,230 in Britain) and Mitsubishi 3000GT (Pounds 38,329). It is far
cheaper than a Pounds 58,000 Mercedes 300-24v SL, which is the best seller
in the sporting high-performance class, less than half the price of the
magnificent 3-litre, V8-engined 500 SL I am driving at present.
But I do not see them as competitors. Cars of this class are bought as an
indulgence, or perhaps to recapture lost youth. (A typical buyer is at least
45 years old and may drive his Supra, SL or Jaguar XJ-S sedately, which is
perhaps just as well). They are cars for making a personal statement about
their owners rather than for tearing around in. Supra and SL convey
different messages. Settling behind the Supra's wheel is a pleasure in
itself; the instrument and control layout is faultless. Everything one needs
is standard equipment - twin airbags, air conditioning, a front spoiler that
drops down at 56 mph (90 kph) and retracts below that speed, leather trim,
cruise control, power-adjusted driver's seat and an elaborate anti-theft
system.
There is only one optional extra; a one-day course on and around Silverstone
Circuit with the John Watson Performance Driving School. It will cost Supra
buyers Pounds 260. They may feel it is worth every penny because it will be
the only chance they will ever have of discovering what their new toy will
do.

<TEXT>
I WENT TO a golf tournament in the Czech Republic. This, I suppose, is like
going to watch snooker in the Andes. Eastern Europe is not exactly classic
links-land. The nearest examples of seaside turf, pot bunkers and rolling
sand dunes are hundreds of miles away.
I was there to find out about the 'other half': the professional golfer who
drives a battered Morris Minor, does not have a Greg Norman-size bank
account and lives with his parents in east London. Golf can seem glamorous
and alluring if you look at the White Shark and his 12 Ferraris. The other
side is more about bald tyres, leaking radiators and five-footers for your
own money.
The tournament was the Corfin Charity Challenge, one of many events
throughout Europe on what is called the Challenge tour - a satellite circuit
for those who have not yet made it with the big boys. It was held on a
course called Marianske Lazne, which is about three hours' drive along
country roads west of Prague.
Considering golf was suppressed for four decades under communist rule, it
looked in remarkably good condition. What is more, this royal and ancient
game was being played - appropriately but astonishingly - on a course opened
by Edward VII in 1908.
At first sight it looked like any other tournament. There were
leader-boards, a press office, marshals with 'Quiet please' signs, a
practice ground - even ropes to keep the crowds at bay.
The professionals looked like any other professionals, squeaky clean,
dressed immaculately. They behaved like other professionals, beating balls
from dawn to dusk on the practice ground. And they seemed to hit just as
straight and just as far as their more illustrious brothers.
There were differences, not least the fact that I was the only spectator;
the ropes down the sides of each fairway were there to keep me from charging
on to the course hunting autographs. Most of the 118 players carried their
own bags, unable to afford caddies. Occasionally, a father or a girlfriend
would step in, pulling a trolley and offering consolation. For most, though,
it was a lonely walk, a solitary existence.
'We all have a dream,' said one hopeful, Alan Saddington. 'We all think we
are one day going to burst through and take the regular tour by storm. If we
didn't, there would be no point in being out here. You have to have a
vision. I would do this whether there was any money to win this week or
not.'
Only the top 15 in each tournament (out of 120 or so) will make a net profit
at the end of the week. By the time Sunday night comes round, there are,
inevitably, many more disillusioned and sad souls than celebrating ones.
'It's not depressing,' says Andy Stubbs, whose baby the Challenge tour is.
'We are providing alternative competition for those who haven't made it on
the regular tour.
'Believe it or not, there are hundreds of guys out there, all over Europe,
prepared to spend over Pounds 500 of their own money, every week, following
their dream to be a professional golfer. Most of them don't make a living
but, for those few who do, it's all worthwhile.'
It costs about Pounds 20,000, in living and travel expenses, to play the
Challenge tour for a season. Most of the players do not have sponsors. Many
drive from event to event because it is cheaper than flying.
They share jokes and sandwiches with each other even though they are in
competition. They refuse to treat themselves to a meal in a restaurant
unless they have had a good week. Before the last putt has dropped on Sunday
night, most are on their way, in cars and caravans, to the next event.
The Challenge tour has 51 events worth a total of Pounds 2.4m, which might
sound a lot until you compare it with the Pounds 24m available on the
star-studded Volvo European tour. It costs Pounds 150,000 to sponsor a
Challenge tour event, compared with more than Pounds 1m on the Volvo tour.
Nick Faldo says his dealings with the media corps are the most difficult
part of being a superstar. After he won the Open at Muirfield last year,
some of this frustration was evident when he thanked them 'from the heart of
my bottom' in his victory speech. He says the endless requests from
autograph hunters often get on his nerves.
Those on the Challenge tour would give their back teeth for just a little of
this harassment.

FT  21 AUG 93 / Sport: A very wet timeshare - Fishing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HE WAS dressed by Hardy's of Alnwick but it could have been Hardy Amies.
Teeth clamped around the remains of a Davidoff, standing waist-deep in clear
running water, the fisherman eased back his rod and cast the fly.
He cast with all the assurance of someone who had four salmon on the bank in
the time it took to smoke his cigar. They looked like bars of
silver-made-flesh, only silver is probably cheaper.
Fishing the Lower Falls beat of the River Beauly in Inverness-shire in July
is a heartening experience at a time when estuary netting, drift netting at
sea, disease and seals have contributed to a decline in the Scottish salmon.
On the Lower Falls beat the fish are there in large numbers, and they are
being caught.
There is a price to pay, however: Pounds 70,000 for the right to use one rod
in perpetuity for a single July week. Stalking potential buyers can be a
sport in itself. Further along the bank, a visiting American had rented a
rod with a view to buying if his week went well.
Clad in black waders, deer-stalker hat and pale cream waistcoat, he looked
part-frogman, part-fisherman. He had flown over on Concorde, lured by the
mystique of the Scottish salmon. But would he take the bait? He had caught
one fish in three days.
Others were catching bagfuls. Eighteen had been taken on the Tuesday and 75
the previous week, the famous Ferry Pool living up to its reputation. Yet
one woman was still inclined to grumble. She had not caught anything that
morning.
'I can't understand the attitude of some fishers', said William Midwood,
managing director of River Beauly Fishings which owns the beats. Midwood is
fishing-mad, comes from a landed background and manages to blend his passion
for the salmon and its welfare with the realities of running a salmon river
for profit.
The Upper, Middle and Lower Beauly beats were bought from The Hon Simon
Fraser, Master of Lovat and son of Lord Lovat, whose family had owned the
fishings for centuries, in 1990. The new owners adopted the fashionable
late-1980s trend of parcelling-up river beats and selling them in
'rod-weeks'. The stigma of Spanish holiday disasters has led most of the
fishing companies to describe their time-share arrangements as syndication,
but it amounts to the same thing.
The price that fisheries charge depends on the average catches. The Pounds
70,000 asking price for the Lower Beauly beat, for example, was based on an
average of seven fish a week at that time of year, or Pounds 10,000 per
fish. Asking prices are lower at other times of the year when fish are
scarcer.
Because some people catch more than others, and because salmon do not always
oblige by swimming up the river at the appointed time, the wisest syndicate
managers are investing in the future.
The managers of Beauly Fishings have taken something of a designer-river
approach, creating lies for fish where none existed. If the water is too low
it is raised by the creation of a weir. If the salmon need rocks for a
resting lie, they get them. If the fisherman needs a light for his cigar
there is a gillie on hand ready to oblige.
Instead of leaving all the returning salmon to their own devices, the
gillies spend the winter seeding the feeder burns with fry, hatched from
salmon, stripped of their eggs and milt.
The fry are ladled from buckets, one into every square meter of water. 'They
soon establish their own territories and do not bunch up in shoals, which is
what happens if they are all thrown in together. This way, I believe, they
have a much better chance of survival', says Midwood
His hatchery programme is concentrating on breeding spring fish, in the
belief that their fry will also return in the springtime. The Beauly has an
extensive feeder system, spoiled partly by the hydro dams which have dried
up some of the headwaters.
Midwood is conscious that the company owns 12 miles of the river and not
every part fishes as well as the Lower Beat. While Lower Beauly was teeming
with fish, only 300 had made their way up the two dams, via twice-daily
lifts, to the Upper Beauly where I was fishing. Still, the fish were there,
if not so easy to catch.
My salmon fishing experience is basic. Most of it has been spent not
catching fish on the River Tay in the spring. The three days spent not
catching fish on the Beauly differed only in that I was not catching them
with the fly as opposed to not catching them with the spinner or the shrimp.
Just once in those three days a fish rose to the fly, but I managed to
snatch it out of its mouth just in time. The gillie groaned, the man from
Trout and Salmon magazine groaned also and Midwood groaned too, but I was
happy. It has taken many years of thrashing salmon waters to perfect this
ability to avoid catching salmon. A long time ago I caught a 23lb fish. It
was my first, a big one, and I have not since seen its like.

FT  21 AUG 93 / Travel: Naxos: an island waiting to burst - Nicholas
Woodsworth took a spring sojourn on a Greek island and found its
out-of-season promise preferable to summer's sybaritic fulfilment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS WOODSWORTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT WAS too early in the year for crowds. Later, in July and August, the boat
decks and lounges, gangways and cabins of the Apollo Express would be
crawling with island-hoppers. But for the moment - 8.30 on a blowy spring
morning - the beautiful people of the Aegean summer were relegated to
kitchen dishwashers, commuter buses and lecture halls a world away from the
port of Piraeus.
I was virtually alone on the ferry's upper boat deck. The only other
passenger braving the cold wind as the Apollo slipped its moorings and
headed south was a bearded young backpacker holding a paperback. It was
Carlos Castenada's A Yaqui Way of Knowledge. I was astonished. It was the
same book that bearded young backpackers were reading on boat trips out to
the Greek islands more than 20 years ago.
Summer wanderers, package tourists, sun-seeking nudists, fun-seeking jet
setters, holidaying students - all are hardy perennials that survive from
year to year. But what, I wondered, was left of the islands that have been
their playground for decades? The last time I had visited Ios, once my
favourite island in the Cyclades, I had given it up for lost. There were too
many people, too many establishments with names like Homer's Discotheque.
Was the whole Mediterranean turning into a gigantic Costa? I hoped that on
the island of Naxos, in spring, the answer would be No. From the quayside at
Naxos the eye of the newly-arrived visitor is first drawn by a massive
marble gateway - all that is left of a seaside temple of Apollo - at one end
of the port. It moves onwards to the long sweep of white-washed buildings
that run the length of waterfront, then rises upwards to the cube-shaped
houses that climb, disorderly, to the top of the hill that makes up the old
town.
My own eye, though, ran anxiously over the shopfronts, restaurants and
businesses along the harbour-front - usually the maddest of places when
holiday madness overcomes islands. There was no Homer's Discotheque. Any
number of other establishments, though, firmly placed Naxos in the frenetic
heart of the late 20th century.
A sign at the Veggera Bar invited me to sample one of its exotic cocktails -
'Sex on the Beach', 'Never on Sunday' or the 'Indiana Jones Pina Colada
Special.' Next door I could rent a beach buggy or a screaming off-road dirt
bike.
Further down the harbour was the Day and Night Club, Popi's Grill, the Smile
Fast Food and a gathering of restaurants, boutiques, film processors,
jewellery shops and other outlets designed for the satisfaction of modern
hungers. As Anthony Quinn's Zorba described the numerous and inevitable
imperfections of modern life, this was, in short, the complete catastrophe.
Or was it? For indulgence in sybaritic consumption the setting was perfect.
Just one element was missing: the sybaritic consumer. The only idle people
about were a few Greeks fiddling with worry beads and sipping tiny cups of
coffee. The feeding-frenzy atmosphere of the resort in high season was
absent.
Instead, quietly hanging over Naxos was an atmosphere of expectation and
preparation. Cafe owners were busily splashing new coats of whitewash on to
winter-weathered walls. Newsagents were replenishing wheeled sidewalk racks
with fresh stocks of postcards: one rack for the breasts and bottoms of
seaside cheesecake, another for the stark blue and white images of the
unspoiled island idyll. In the window of the Zas travel agency, winter ferry
timetables were coming down, summer ones going up.
Naxos was a town waiting to burst. The promise, I was sure, was preferable
to its fulfilment. Here was a bright blue sky, a white-horse-capped sea, and
sunshine that bounced blindingly from one white wall to another.
Here were most of summer's pleasures with none of its maddening and
claustrophobic inconveniences. Not even the strong north wind that blew
constantly for the next few days put me off. If the simple and sensual Greek
island world exists, it exists out of season.
There is a wonderful thing about Mediterranean island tourism - it is almost
wholly oriented towards the Mediterranean. Most escapees from the cold,
misty cities of the north are mad about warm water and sun-drenched beaches.
While they are willing to undergo almost any kind of overcrowding just to
lie there and baste, summer insanity wanes proportionally with distance from
the water.
Out of season this is true even in the town of Naxos itself. Move just two
streets back from the waterfront and the hubbub of modern commercialism
abruptly dies. In a steep, stone-flagged maze of narrow streets I meandered
through a town that was sunny, deserted and silent.
Naxos is a town of great age. Over the millennia the island has seen the
coming and going of Mycenean, Persian, Ptolomaic, Roman, Byzantine, Venetian
and Turkish rule. I walked up worn marbled stairways banked with bright red
geraniums; through arched stone passageways into hidden, cobbled squares;
past tiny blue-domed churches where sweet incense wafted from the door; on
to whitewashed terraces where cats sat sunning themselves high over the sea.
The postcards do not lie: the Aegean is both the cheesecake found everywhere
and a simple beauty found nowhere else.
If Naxos' main town boasted only a sprinkling of pre-season visitors, the
rest of it seemed left entirely to its 16,000 island inhabitants. Some 70kms
long and topped by the 1,000m-high Mount Za, Naxos is the largest island in
the Cyclades. With more than 40 villages there is room not only for frantic
seaside tourism but a slower, older pace of Greek life as well.
Coast, inland plateau or fertile valley? Bouncing around in a beaten-up
hired Jeep I tried to decide which sounded more appealing. In the end, I
tried and liked them all. I drove south to the sea at Agia Ana, past sloping
fields dotted with windmills and cactus and ablaze with a spring carpet of
wind-whipped daisies and poppies. The beach tavernas and pensions were
boarded-up, their terraces thick with sand.
I walked, the only soul on a stretch of golden beach 5km long. I climbed the
lonely headland of Mikri Vigla. Almost blown over at the summit, I gazed
across an Aegean wild and frothy with whitecaps.
To the east, I drove upwards into the wide, tawny-green bowl of the Tragea,
the most fertile farming land in the Cyclades. Surrounded by dry, flinty
hills, there are dark green citrus groves here, orchards of gnarled olive
trees, and on every promontory and hill a gleaming white church.
My favourite place, though, was the valley of Potamia. If, as myth has it,
Dionysus settled down to a life of bucolic charm with Ariadne on Naxos, it
might have been here in this fold in the rocky slopes below Mount Zas. Water
has turned the valley into an oasis; as it flows down through shady,
stone-lined channels from one village to the next and out into terraced
fields, it sustains the same life it has for ages.
Amid a profusion of flowering orchards and trees laden with lemons, I
followed a clattering, fodder-laden donkey past the houses of Ano Potamia.
In Kato Potamia an old woman who spoke not a word reached up and picked
half-a-dozen oranges for me. In Meso Potamia I watched a procession led by a
bearded monk in black robes parade gilt-covered images of St George through
the village. It is a walk I would like to do again in the autumn, when the
Day and Night Club is deserted, Popi's Grill is closed - and Naxos is quiet
once more.

FT  21 AUG 93 / Travel: Why things are stirring in Amman - Jordan's capital
is transforming
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES WHITTINGTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'WHAT'S THERE to do in Amman?' is a question often heard among Jordanians
(and expatriates) as they ponder how to while away their evenings in the
kingdom's sleepy capital.
Whether they are cruising the streets of up-town Sheisani in their new
Mercedes-Benz or smoking hubbly-bubbly from a discoloured water pipe in a
down-town cafe, the discussions are nearly always the same.
Locals complain that Amman is a 'village' compared with Beirut, Cairo,
Damascus and Baghdad before the Gulf crisis. They moan that there is only
one nightclub 'where no one ever goes', a handful of bars (three, according
to most right-on Jordanians), and a limited selection of restaurants.
Boredom, frustration and nostalgia for a different life or better place are
common among residents of Amman. Yet things are changing. Over the past few
years the city has been transformed irrevocably.
A construction boom has expanded the once-small dusty outpost east of the
Jordan River to a sprawling urban complex which continues to eat up the
surrounding desert. And the arrival of some 350,000 Palestinians has
diversified Amman's already multifarious society.
Thousands of Iraqis have also sought refuge in Amman away from Saddam's iron
fist and Iraq's ravaged economy. And, as residents are constantly reminded
in Amman, Jordan now has democracy.
To a tourist whose Jordanian itinerary will invariably include the Nabataean
city of Petra, the Dead Sea, the desert at Wadi Rum and perhaps a few nights
in Amman, changes to the capital's life have to be taken on trust.
Even to Jordan's social moaners, the variety of what is available has to be
pointed out. Culturally, Amman is breaking new ground in art and theatre.
Most notable are the Iraqi and Syrian artists whose exhibitions are
advertised regularly in the newspapers.
There is an increasing number of new galleries where prices are cheap. And
an interest in contemporary regional art is slowly becoming fashionable
among Amman's middle class.
More dramatic is the effect of political change, which is causing a
revolution in the kingdom's theatre. One group of local thespians, 'Ahlan
Nabil and Hisham', has taken the process of political pluralism and freedom
of speech to the stage with a nightly comedy that caricatures ministers,
parliamentarians and even, cautiously, members of the royal household.
Although still reeling from the shock of political satire, many Jordanians
express hope that the democratisation process will release other forms of
entertainment from the strait-jacket of the past.
The poorly-attended local cinemas, for instance, still suffer from
over-enthusiastic censors who strip the latest Hollywood blockbusters of
nearly all scenes of tenderness, love, passion and lust.
Those determined to find out what has been cut simply go to the nearest
video shop and rent an uncensored version.
Increased liberalisation, however, is far from guaranteed by the
democratisation process. The Moslem Brotherhood has already attempted to
push through a parliamentary bill to ban the sale of alcohol in the kingdom.
Further, the brotherhood was almost successful in passing a law to segregate
men and women in public swimming pools and gymnasiums.
In concert with Amman's cultural and political changes, the city itself is
undergoing an extensive facelift. A construction boom has added some 20,000
new buildings, including villas, mansions and palaces being built by
returnees from the Gulf.
A recent survey showed Amman to be the most expensive capital in the Arab
world. Although there is a lack of cement to sustain the construction boom,
Amman can no longer be described as a backwater.
It is still not Cairo, Damascus or Baghdad. But give it another five years
and even the socialites may not want to leave.

FT  21 AUG 93 / Travel: A new light on France
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARIAN EDMUNDS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The people of Ailly-Sur-Noye, 16km south of the French town of Amiens, are
presenting a history lesson with a difference, writes Marian Edmunds. On
five weekends every year, the history of the region spanning 15 epochs is
relived through a son et lumiere, one of 54 such productions across France.
The action takes place on a meadow by a lake but spills over to an island
and beyond to a windmill and the forest fringe. So atmospheric and
entrancing are the music and the lights that a limited grasp of French is
not an impairment.
In seven years, Ailly-Sur-Noye's slickly-produced spectacle has come to be
regarded as one of France's best, second only to that of Le Puy-du-Fou in
the Vendee region in eastern France.
Ten years ago the Ailly show was just a dream for Dominique Martens, a young
bank clerk, who was not discouraged by those who said it was impossible to
have a son et lumiere without a cathedral or castle.
More than 650 local people participate, each making several costume changes
during the night. Twenty horses also appear.
It is possible to attend the Ailly show as part of a weekend break from
London, for the village is only 100 miles south of Calais. It is staged on
Fridays and Saturdays from August 27.
Amiens Cathedral also runs sound and light performances, some in English.
Nearer to Paris is the Meaux Seine-et-Marne spectacle - June, late August
and early September - while also worth catching are the spectacles of
Flagnac and Saint-Fargeau. Most shows utilise a castle or cathedral.
Tickets for Ailly-Sur-Noye cost FFr70 for adults, FFr40 for children under
12 and FFr60 when part of a group 30 or more strong. They can be reserved at
Terre de Picardie, 80250 Ailly-Sur-Noye, tel: (33) 22 41 06 90. Information
on dates and locations of spectacles can be had from the Federation National
Des Fetes et Spectacles Historique, Hotel-de-Ville de Beauvais 60000, tel:

FT  21 AUG 93 / Despatches: The ghost town of Graham Greene
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK GRAY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   HAVANA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS still just a seven-minute walk from the Phastcleaners shop on
Lamparilla Street, Havana, to the Wonder Bar at the corner of Virtudes and
Consulado - the same time it took Jim Wormold to escape from his
vacuum-cleaner agency for a mid-day daiquiri with his old friend, Dr
Hasselbacher.
Wormold, anti-hero of Graham Greene's Our Man In Havana, was impaired by a
limp and, given the traffic that must have prevailed in late 1950s Havana,
seven minutes must have been a close-run thing. Today there is little
traffic to slow the curious visitor, but it is still a brisk walk, made all
the more difficult because of the distraction of finding traces of Wormold's
Havana 35 years after publication of Greene's novel.
Such landmarks are not easy to find, given the Cuban capital's neglected
state and the preponderance of tin sheets covering the windows and
entrance-ways to the city's once-infamous nightspots.
But there are some pleasant surprises, for a few beacons have survived to
make the curious visitor, armed with a street map, ballpoint pen and
Greene's Penguin paperback, feel he is getting somewhere. Greene's Havana
centred on the shopping and banking thoroughfares of the old district, with
a few amusing diversions into uptown Vedado, location of then-swank hotels,
and into the classy neighbourhoods of Miramar.
Our Man In Havana was oddly prophetic, hinting at great 'enemy' military
installations in the interior against the background of an unstable
government, that of Castro's then-nemisis, Fulgencio Batista. That some of
the installations looked like giant vacuum-cleaner fittings, including
snap-action couplings, was the amusing twist to the story.
Trying to find any trace of Phastcleaners, or any shop selling conventional
retail goods, is impossible today. Lamparilla Street, running east to the
waterfront, is parallelled by Obrapia, Obispo and O'Reilly, a hive of
activity in Wormold's day, but now a neighbourhood through which people walk
but do not stop because there is little to stop for.
The Western Union cable office is still on Obispo, whence Wormold sent his
fraudulent cables to MI-6 in London. And the bells still toll at the Church
of Santo Cristo, off Lamparilla, where Wormold's expensive daughter Milly
said her prayers.
Within a baseball throw of the famous Floridita bar, near the top of Obispo
on the Avenida de Belgica, stand two bookshops, one dispensing socialist
tracts, the other an array of old classics and leftovers.
Ask for any Greene, Hemingway or - for that matter - Dickens or Cervantes
and you will be greeted by melancholy headshaking. 'Much in demand, si, but
no, not for long time. You come from Spain? England? Next time bring books.
Paper shortage.' The conversation echoes one heard on a previous visit in
1985.
One of Wormold's haunts on that daily trek for the mid-day daiquiri was the
famous Sloppy Joes, better known as Loppy Youse in Cuban lingo. It was there
that Wormold was recruited by Hawthorne, MI-6's inept Caribbean control. It
was founded in the 1930s by two Spanish brothers, one named Jose, who became
renowned for his unwashed off-white shirts.
A rival Sloppy Joes was set up in Key West, Florida, 90 miles the other side
of the Gulf Stream, a few years later. The original, alas, folded in the
late 1960s due to the post-revolution collapse of tourism and is now sealed
up. One can only draw on the memory of the meeting in Sloppy Joes in the
Alec Guinness-Noel Coward film in which Coward (Hawthorne) recruits Guinness
(Wormold) into the world of spying.
Nearby, on a side street linking the tree-lined Paseo de Marti with Zulueta
Street, stands the shell of the Seville Biltmore Hotel, Hawthorne's Havana
haunt, now being slowly rebuilt.
From nearby Virtudes Street, a visitor can see the towering wedge of the
Havana Libre Hotel - in Greene's day the Hilton - now in need of paint and
new plumbing but still drawing crowds, especially highly solicitous women
seeking convertible currency.
Just below it, in the Vedado district and overlooking the sea, stands the
Hotel Nacional de Cuba, a twin-towered, immaculately restored relic of the
1930s. Its nearly pristine state is a welcome surprise of which Greene
himself might have approved - only a few years ago it was a crumbling relic.
In Jim Wormold's day, the Nacional was the home of the European Traders
Association, which met there regularly for lunch. It was inside the Nacional
that Wormold, tipped off by Hasselbacher in the foyer, warded off a clumsy
assassination attempt in the form of poisoned whisky.
Where the money came from to restore the 483-room Nacional, no one will say.
It is rumoured that Cuban expatriate money from Florida has been pumped in.
Greene returned to Cuba in 1963 and was disappointed to find that some of
the seedier haunts on Zanja Street, an east-west throughfare linking old
Havana with Vedado, had been boarded up, particularly the Shanghai Theatre.
'There, for Dollars 1.25, you could have seen a nude show and three blue
films a night, and there was a pornographic bookshop in the foyer for those
yet unsatisfied', he wrote at the time. These days, no one has even heard of
the Shanghai.
But one aspect of pre-Castro life has not changed - the famous floor show at
the Tropicana, the open-air, jungle-motif night-club on the edge of the
leafy Miramar district. It was at the Tropicana, amid the dazzle of dancing
girls, that Wormold helped his daughter celebrate her birthday, at the same
time protecting her from the unsubtle groping of the evil Captain Segura of
the Havana police department with the help of his MI-6 cypher clerk,
Beatrice Severn.
All is as it was except for the gaming tables which were, in any event, out
of sight from the main floor-show area. The round bar is still there, as is
the original stage, set in a grotto. The floor show is probably the best
anywhere in the western hemisphere, and regularly features some 65 barely
post-adolescent dancers, clad in jewelled nether garments, and an Afro-Cuban
band of 25 musicians. The pulsing performance (prices range from Dollars
40-Dollars 55 per head, and all seats are good) lasts 2 1/2 hours and only
stops short of a human sacrifice. There are many Fay Wrays onstage; all that
is missing is King Kong. It is the Tropicana's proud boast that it has been
operating continuously since 1939.
After the Tropicana I returned to town, to the corner of Virtudes and
Consulado. An old woman sitting in a chair, knitting, remembered the Wonder
Bar, or, rather, two bars answering the description, identical and on
opposite corners, both sealed up. They were muy popular among the
shopkeepers, she recalled.
It was at the Wonder Bar that Our Man In Havana turned deadly serious, for
it was there that Hasselbacher was killed by unknown foreign assailants. But
one should not get too serious. Greene's novel, like modern-day Havana, is a
work of fiction.

WHEN the all-white dancers of South Africa's Transvaal state ballet
performed in the black township of Tsakane, they were careful to ensure that
a chain-link fence separated them from the black audience.
It was not violence they feared. Tsakane is a peaceful place. But the bored
ballerinas and their haughty artistic director, Dawn Weller Raistrick,
seemed to want to make a point: that the troupe was there only under
protest. Fearing that a black government would cut off state funding for
traditionally 'white' art forms such as ballet and opera, the ballerinas
were making a belated attempt to popularise their craft. But they were not
going to do it cheerfully.
As the struggle for power intensifies in South African politics, so it does
in the world of culture. Those who favour 'Eurocentric' art forms fear a
cultural bloodbath under a black government. As art critic Barry Ronge wrote
in the Johannesburg Sunday Times recently, whites are tortured by 'visions
of ballet being kicked into oblivion by the gumboots of traditional dancers
and of orchestras . . . fading into dissonance before the throb of the . . .
cowhide drum.'
These fears are probably misplaced, for when the African National Congress
convened a national cultural conference recently, its officials were at
pains to convey a reassuring message to frightened whites: ballet, opera and
symphony will continue to have a treasured place in the new South Africa,
but they will have to get by with less state money.
'For state money not to be put into opera would be like attacking the
Voortrekker monument,' said one delegate to the conference, referring to the
granite pile outside Pretoria regarded by Afrikaners as their most sacred
monument. ANC officials know that there is no quicker way to accelerate the
white 'brain drain' than to attack yuppie pursuits such as opera and ballet;
they know that a message of cultural reconciliation will help whites
(especially Afrikaners) accept political change.
'As much as possible, we must preserve ballet, we must preserve opera, we
must preserve symphony, we must preserve what European South Africans have
contributed to this country,' says Wally Serote, head of the ANC's
department of arts and culture. 'But we cannot preserve that at the expense
of other things.'
That is the problem in a nutshell. For in the old South Africa, culture was
as strictly segregated as housing or education. Abolishing cultural
apartheid will be as costly as upgrading black schools or hospitals.
Until recently, the four provincial 'performing arts councils,' which have
their own standing ballet and opera companies and their own symphony
orchestras, funded 'white' arts exclusively. They built no arts venues in
black townships (white Johannesburg recently spent R132m (Pounds 26.2m) to
refurbish its civic theatre, though neighbouring Soweto, a city of 3m, has
no theatre or concert hall). They spent almost nothing on black theatre,
dance or music.
For over 40 years, the ruling National Party used the state-funded arts to
promote Afrikaner ethnicity, with the political goal of strengthening the
volk against the black hordes. Indeed, a 1972 government commission of
enquiry into arts funding treated only Afrikaans art under its chapter on
'indigenous art forms in South Africa' - as though black African art did not
exist. And though the arts councils are trying to redress this balance,
their efforts have gone little beyond tokenism.
If the National Party abused culture as a tool of oppression, the ANC used
it as a political weapon in the struggle against apartheid. When other forms
of dissent were crushed, black actors and playwrights protested alone, and
the ANC-inspired international cultural boycott brought pressure for change.
The task now is to depoliticise the arts, to prevent the ANC from using the
state-funded arts, as the Afrikaners did before them, to promote their
ethnic interests. ANC officials are adamant that this is not their
intention, but some artists are sceptical. And Wally Serote's proposal for
arts funding - that the government should fund an autonomous national arts
council which would disperse funds to mostly private production companies -
sounds fine until he adds that the council would have to follow
government-set spending priorities to redress imbalances caused by
apartheid.
Still, these imbalances must be redressed, not least because the ANC's dream
of building a new South African nationhood depends upon it. Cultural
apartheid exacerbated ethnic divisions; the ANC's aim is to create a
'non-racial' state where culture unites rather than divides.
That is laudable. But given the reality of ethnic antagonism in South
Africa, it is a long-term goal. Mixed audiences are rare. The bulk of arts
performances are Eurocentric, the bulk of audiences white. The arts council
directors say that output is, at least in part, market-driven: white patrons
buy the tickets, and for the moment, they want to hear their own stories,
watch their own dance forms and listen to their own cultural sounds.
The ANC says its stress is always on uplifting African arts, not suppressing
European ones. 'The basics of opera - voice and story-telling - are really
African forms of art,' says Mike van Graan, secretary of the National Arts
Initiative, an anti-apartheid cultural group. He is confident that,
eventually, South Africans will learn to appreciate each other's art forms,
and forge new forms of their own. That, after all, is what the new South
Africa is all about.

FT  21 AUG 93 / Special Report - Courses and Careers: The 'right' choice
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
IT IS the question I always dreaded: 'What do you want to be when you grow
up?'
It is easy to answer if you have a deep-seated desire to become a doctor, a
teacher or a vet. But the choice is harder for the majority of young people
who have no particular vocation. Interest may point them in a general
direction, but, without practical insight into working life, how can they
tell whether they have the ability or the staying power for a particular
career?
In British education, academic and vocational studies are still seen as
distinct from one another; the former leading, via the 'gold standard' of A
levels, to university, and the latter perceived as carrying a lower status.
Schools tend to encourage any students with passable academic abilities to
choose university.
Pupils often go with the flow, only to find their academic degree courses
stressful and dispiriting. Others emerge at the end of three years as
unemployed graduates, still facing the problem of a career choice.
It is difficult for the uncommitted 18-year-old to make an informed
decision, although many schools are dealing with this problem more
proficiently than in the past. The careers advice programme at the Lady
Eleanor Holles School in Hampton, Middlesex, is built into Personal and
Social Education (PSE), and designed to inform and focus pupils' minds on
career possibilities. But the weight of advice still falls heavily in favour
of formal academic training, acknowledges Jenny Barnes, head of the careers
department.
Sometimes, a more practically oriented, 'hands-on' course is a better
alternative for those uninspired by the idea of university, or who wish to
take time out before committing themselves to three years of further
academic study. It can make the transition from classroom to career less of
a leap in the dark.
BTEC National Diploma courses, for example, offer practical training and the
opportunity to test one's interest and aptitude for various disciplines
which make up areas such as design, the media, or the leisure industry.
After two years closeted with the text of Macbeth, it may be time to find
out how one translates a play from page to stage. An A level in economics
could be the theoretical context for some practical insight into running a
business. Other ideas may emerge from leisure interests such as gardening,
photography or travel.
The choice is wide. At 18, one can afford to experiment.
Public and private institutions advertise widely at this time of year, in
the media, libraries and specialist publications. Local further education
colleges are a useful starting point for surveying the field.
Read the prospectuses carefully and try to get a feel for the kind of
courses offered in a chosen area. Entry requirements, course components,
means of assessment and final qualifications will vary, and there may be
elements which are of particular interest, such as work placements.
When you find something that satisfies your criteria, ask if you can visit
the college before making a formal application. Talk to people following the
course, or those who have completed it. Colleges should be happy to suggest
contacts.
Try to assess the course's standing. Some lead to nationally recognised
qualifications, but the reputation of private diplomas varies. You should
ask for proof of quality. Know where you stand in relation to funding. Grant
support varies. If you intend to take up a university place later on, make
sure you do not preclude yourself from assistance by using up your
entitlement.

FT  21 AUG 93 / Special Report - Courses and Careers: Performing for the
future
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
IN A school hall cluttered with the kind of detritus you would normally hope
to dispose of in a jumble sale, Helen Adams and Natalia Campbell are busy
rehearsing Sue Townsend's Bazaar &amp; Rummage, for the 1993 Edinburgh Festival
fringe.
It is the student equivalent of coals to Newcastle. Both are taking a BTEC
course in the performing arts at Barking College. The fact that they are
prepared to spend their summer vacation rehearsing and performing is a
measure of their enthusiasm.
Neither embarked on the course with precise ideas about her future. Helen
intended to study theology at university. Half way through A levels, she was
invited by her school's enterprising drama company, Short Back &amp; Sides, to
help out with stage management for their 1992 'fringe' production. 'I went
up there, and I just loved it,' she recalls.
'I don't think I've ever made such a big decision,' she says. Her parents
were supportive, but cautious. 'They thought I'd just get it out of my
system and then go back and finish my A levels. But since I've been doing
the course, they've really had their eyes opened. They've seen how much I've
changed.'
Natalia had had early ambitions to study drama. After leaving school she
spent some time at the Lee Strasbourg Studio in London. 'At the time I was
only 17. It was a bit strong for me, I think. I couldn't handle it.' But
after a couple of years at work, she felt it was time for a rethink. 'I
started looking for colleges in the area, and I was advised to do a BTEC (a
nationally recognised diploma) because it's a much more practical approach.
You get involved, rather than just sitting in a classroom.'
Barking's two-year full time course is concerned with the development of
practical creative skills in drama, dance, music and stagecraft. Most of the
work is carried out in groups. Performance and production, a study of the
arts in society, and arts administration form the core subjects. Students
have the opportunity to specialise in particular areas, but the compulsory
units mean that everyone gains experience of all aspects of the performing
arts.
Helen and Natalia were thrown in at the deep end. Their first assignment was
to research and produce a 30-40 minute production.
The course is almost entirely practical. The lack of written work may be a
relief from the more academic regime of A levels, but in some ways it is
even more demanding. 'Everything you do is assessed,' explains Natalia,
implying that you cannot get away with three weeks' cramming before a final
exam.
Students also have to produce a working diary, which forms a personal record
between pupil and tutor. It is both a form of self-assessment, and a means
of developing critical faculties and an understanding of group dynamics.
There are individual tutorials at the end of each project, to focus on any
problems which may have arisen.
But this is not an encounter group or a course in navel-contemplation -
quite the opposite. Natalia notes the way in which the course has developed
maturity and communication skills among the students. 'Some people came
straight out of school. With seven or eight of us thrown together doing a
project, you always get people who clash. But you work it out,' she says.
'So many people have changed in the process of working from September to
now. It's unbelievable.'
Helen endorses this view: 'It teaches you how to communicate in real life,
how to react to different things, and how to accept people, for what they
are and what they believe in. A lot of us have different beliefs. We've all
come up against it, and we've all found a way of getting on.'
One year into the course, how do the two students see their future? 'Since
I've been at the college, I've done so many things outside as well. It's
opened doors,' says Helen. 'I'm ready for anything, from singing on a
Caribbean liner to skivvying in a theatre in London.'
Not everyone will enter the arts professionally. But there is more to be
gained here than vocational training. Helen and Natalia thought they'd be
learning about the theatre, and find they're learning about life. The course
breeds confidence.
'I reckon most people at the college will get a place somewhere,' says
Helen. 'Everyone's got the enthusiasm to do anything. That's the basis,
isn't it?'

FT  21 AUG 93 / Special Report - Courses and Careers: University still
beckons for the energetic - Despondent about your A-level grades? Education
correspondent John Authers has some advice for aspiring college entrants
</HEADLINE>

FINDING A university place during the next few weeks could be even more
stressful than taking A-levels.
Improved A-level results, plus an unexpected cut in government funds to
universities, have conspired to cut places available via the 'clearing'
system to applicants who had no conditional offers, or who narrowly missed
their grades.
The Polytechnic Central Admission System reported yesterday that 23
universities and colleges have withdrawn their arts and humanities courses
from the clearing system because they were already full. The Universities
Central Council on Admissions, the other body which oversees clearing, also
predicts that places may be tighter this year.
But this does not mean that you should panic if your A-level grades did not
quite reach the hoped-for level. Clearing will be much harder than usual
this year, but university places are there for those who are prepared to be
flexible.
This is particularly true in practical and scientific courses, which have
the same level of government funding as last year. For example, Surrey
University, which specialises in scientific and applied courses, does not
anticipate allocating any fewer places via the clearing system this year
than it did last.
Many new combined and vocational courses have been introduced by
universities during the last few years, as higher education has expanded.
These could be of interest to those prepared to be flexible.
So what do you? The clearing process will not start until Wednesday. In the
interim, universities must confirm offers they have made.
This involves 200,000 university decisions in a very few working days.
Applicants should have two offers - a firm offer and, another, usually for
lower grades, as insurance. If the firm offer has been satisfied, then the
university must offer the applicant a place. Similarly, if the firm offer
has been missed, but the insurance offer has been fulfilled, the
second-choice university must offer a place to the applicant. This works
both ways. Applicants are not free to 'shop around' for an alternative place
until they know that they have not been awarded places by their two
first-choice universities.
Those who had no conditional offers are free to telephone universities with
vacancies as soon as their results are published.
UCCA warns: 'Admissions offices must confirm the places of all the
candidates holding conditional offers who have met those conditions. Until
this is done, there may be very little admissions offices can tell
candidates who telephone in.'
Applicants eligible for clearing, once it starts, will receive a clearing
entry form and leaflets from UCCA. They are advised to make direct contact
with a small number of universities - many of which have special 'hotlines'
for the purpose - to check whether there are vacancies.
BBC Student Choice '93 will provide advice on Radio 5 about vacancies and
universities will advertise in national newspapers. Information should be
readily available in schools, colleges and career services. In all cases,
universities should advertise the minimum number of A-level points they will
require. Check possible vacancies daily.
If lucky, you should be able to persuade the university to submit a Q
request for your papers from UCCA. This shows that the university is
serious, and it is via this process that 90 per cent of clearing places are
offered. However, the process is time-consuming, so do not ask more than one
university to make a Q request.
Fill in the clearing entry form, listing up to four choices of university
and course, in order of preference (with any university which has made a Q
request put in first place). Computers do the rest - each choice on the form
will be matched to see if the university has vacancies, and whether your
A-levels are good enough.
UCCA also has a clearing panel for giving individual attention to applicants
who slip through the net.
The entire process can last until September 25. Nobody pretends that the
next month will be enjoyable for those looking for places - but places are
there for those with the energy and flexibility to look. Useful telephone
numbers: UCCA, 0242-222444; PCAS, 0242-227788;BBC Radio 5 off-air advice
line, 0500-505050; University of Hertfordshire Hotline, 0707-284848;

'PEOPLE IN cash-and-carrys in England looked at me as if I had three heads
when I said I was going to open a supermarket in Moscow,' says Michael
Coughlan. 'They thought I was a complete lunatic.' Eighteen months later, in
spite of Russian hyperinflation and political turbulence, the business
appears to be doing well.
ON A JANUARY 1992 trip to Moscow to investigate a warehouse deal for his
Irish freight business, Coughlan was offered a prime site for a new
supermarket. With his partner, Brendan Flannery, and Richard Pratt, owner of
a Cork-based insurance firm, Coughlan formed an investment company, CFP, to
put up the money to open an Irish food store in Moscow.
The Garden Ring supermarket - named after the Moscow ring road on which it
is located - opened last August. Colm Fitzsimon, the manager, says sales are
increasing at around 6 per cent a week - the kind of growth that an
Irish-based supermarket would expect in a year. The store's success has been
helped by its central location on the site of an old Soviet state food shop,
an enormous advantage in a market where good real estate is scarce.
Coughlan and his partners may now be what Fitzsimon describes as 'three very
happy individuals,' but the road has not been easy. It is almost impossible
for a foreign business to set up alone in Moscow, since it can take a
potential investor years to disentangle Russian red tape. Reliable Moscow
contacts are invaluable. 'You can't just get off the plane and start a
business here,' says Coughlan.
CFP's path was smoothed initially by the Irish-Russian joint-venture
Irlasto/IVK, which provided the hard-to-get but essential licence. IVK, the
Russian side of the venture, supplies the vital convertible-currency bank
account which enables the supermarket to transfer money out of Russia, and
is difficult for foreigners to obtain. For its services, Irlasto / IVK has
taken a 15 per cent share in the enterprise.
Running the shop would be impossible without Russian input. The director of
the old state food shop, Sergei Novikov, and four senior deputies will
eventually own the store. They are an equal partner in the Garden Ring,
responsible for Russian employees and supervising utilities and transport.
CFP has refurbished the shop and provided all the supplies and top-level
management. 'A good Russian partner is essential,' say Coughlan and
Fitzsimon.
Financing the project, according to Coughlan, was the biggest obstacle.
Equipping the supermarket cost Dollars 750,000. Stocks had to be brought in
from abroad and 24 contractors were flown in from Cork to do up the store.
Finding the money was hard. Coughlan says that banks in Ireland 'simply
wouldn't give anyone a loan for a business venture in the CIS.'
Eventually, CFP had to secure every penny of every loan and put up a lot of
cash itself. Coughlan says banks remain wary, in spite of the set of
accounts CFP can show them. The lesson is that until Russia's economic and
political climate stabilises, would-be investors in Moscow have to be
self-funding.
Another hurdle was adjusting to the taste buds of Moscow's hard currency
shoppers. Prices in the Garden Ring, as in all foreign-owned food shops in
Moscow, are in US dollars, although customers can pay in Irish punts and
other convertible currencies, as well as Russian rubles, albeit at a high
exchange rate. As a result, shoppers are foreigners - business people,
diplomats, journalists - and rich Russians.
The disparate nationalities eat differently from the residents of Limerick,
as Fitzsimon, who has six years' supermarket experience in Ireland and three
years' business experience in Russia, found out after a slow start. Irish
cheeses did not sell well, and CFP expanded the range to include more Dutch
and French cheeses. The Garden Ring reduced its percentage of Irish supplies
from 90 per cent to 70 per cent in the first eight months and ships in
produce from elsewhere in Europe.
Russians make up 60 per cent of the clientele, and Fitzsimon says they are
keen on fish products and exotic fruit, regardless of price. The small
pineapples he sells for Dollars 14.95 are snapped up by Muscovites.
Americans are the largest group of expatriate customers. They flock to the
Garden Ring for cheesecakes and granola.
Irish entrepreneurs operate several businesses in Moscow. 'It has something
to do with Irish business acumen,' says Coughlan. 'The Irish are bigger
risk-takers.'
Fitzsimon has eight Irish staffers working with him, including an assistant
manager, an accountant and a butcher. Not everyone likes it. The first
butcher went back to his village in County Cork as soon as he could get a
flight home.
With the help of two translators, the Irish and the 35 Russian staff have
adjusted to working in an environment which is foreign to both. The Russian
workers have had to learn to smile when they are tired, and to open a new
till when customers are waiting. The Irish have had to get used to seeing
the eight Russian accountants work out sums on abacuses.
Coughlan, as the managing director of CFP, spends one week per month in
Moscow, and Flannery and Pratt travel to Russia every three months.
Fitzsimon is in daily contact with the Cork office, and Coughlan takes
decisions that need to be made on the spot. 'It's the great advantage of
having a small company,' he says. 'I can react quickly and make a decision,
and it pays off. A lot of our competition in Moscow is semi-state owned, and
decisions have to go back to a boardroom.'
Running a business in Moscow is never simple. The Garden Ring is at the
mercy of foreign suppliers. If the fruit and veg lorry does not leave the
Netherlands on schedule, the shelves can be bare all weekend.
In spite of the pitfalls, and the high risks that Coughlan, Flannery and
Pratt have taken, Coughlan remains confident. 'When the uncertainties are
over and the big guns start moving in,' he says, 'we'll be well ahead of the
posse.'

FT  21 AUG 93 / Finance and the Family: Protect yourself against those
thieves who get too personal - Home computers and mobile telephones are
being used widely - but losses are soaring, too. And getting insurance can
be tricky
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PERSONAL computers and mobile telephones are finding their way into the
homes and cars of more and more people. Unfortunately, they are delicate,
easily-damaged pieces of equipment - and extremely attractive to thieves.
How you insure a domestic personal computer will depend on what you use it
for. If it is purely for personal and family operations - playing games,
writing letters or doing the household accounts - it should be easy to
insure under your home contents policy, in the same way as any other
electrical item.
An expensive machine, however, might have to be named on the policy, which
could cost more. One point to watch for is that not all home contents
policies include accidental damage. This can be particularly important with
computer equipment, as even a spilt cup of coffee can cause havoc with the
system.
If you ever use the computer for business, whether your own or your
employer's, cover under your home contents insurance could be invalidated.
Should you have any doubt about what constitutes business use, consult your
insurance company; some are more flexible than others.
Very few home contents policies specifically include equipment used for
business. One which does is Sun Alliance and Chubb's Masterpiece, an
up-market home and contents policy. This covers automatically any business
furnishings and equipment in the home, as well as the more usual home
contents, and will also pay to replace personal data on a home computer. The
snag is that it is available only to people living in houses with other
expensive valuables.
Other insurance companies will want to check the exact set-up before
agreeing to cover home computers used for any degree of business. If they
think the computer falls more under business than personal use, they may
offer to add business cover to your household policy - at a price.
Anyone who runs a business from home could also find it prudent to seek
protection against loss of computer data after an accident, or loss of
income due to business interruption. This is the type of specialist cover
provided by commercial policies.
Mainstream office policies are not designed for people working from home;
the minimum premiums and security requirements can make them impractical for
one-person small businesses. But two companies now offer insurance specially
designed for such circumstances: London &amp; Edinburgh, and Tolson Messenger.
L &amp; E's Home-Work policy covers home and business contents together.
Optional cover is available for buildings, accidental damage, all-risks,
business interruption, liability, goods in transit and so on, depending on
each client's circumstances.
The premiums will depend on what is covered, your postcode, and the kind of
business in which you are involved. Accountants working from home will pay
less than picture restorers, for example.
Tolson Messenger's Home Office policy is confined to business rather than
personal contents. It also covers business interruption, loss of money,
personal assault, and liabilities. There is an automatic Pounds 1,500 of
all-risks cover for items such as portable computers removed temporarily
from your office. For Pounds 7,500 of contents cover, the standard premium
is Pounds 120, rising to Pounds 265 for the maximum Pounds 20,000. There are
some security conditions, such as adequate locks.
Portable computers can present added difficulties, as they need to be
insured for use outside the home and are seen as more vulnerable to theft
and damage. They can usually be covered under home contents personal
possessions, or all-risks extensions; but if you take a portable computer
home from work regularly, make sure it is covered by your employer's
insurance.
National Vulcan has a very comprehensive computer policy, which includes
portables, but it is designed for business users. High levels of cover and
minimum premiums mean it is worthwhile only if you have extremely expensive
equipment which you use a lot or take abroad.
Thefts of mobile 'phones are soaring. Organised thieves steal them to order,
reprogramme them and sell them on, sometimes within minutes of the theft,
while more amateurish thieves may rack up large airtime bills on your
telephone if there is a gap between its being stolen and your reporting the
theft. If you have your own rather than a company one, you might be offered
insurance by your supplier, but this will add considerably to the cost as
premiums have been pushed up by high damage and theft claims. For this
reason, not all mobile 'phone companies offer insurance.
Aztec is one that does and there is a variety of packages. Subscribers can
choose from mechanical breakdown cover for Pounds 3.95 a month; theft and
accidental damage for Pounds 4.95; the two combined for Pounds 7.95; or a
package that also includes air-time misuse (unauthorised calls made after a
'phone is stolen) for Pounds 8.95.
Again, mobiles can be covered under personal possessions or all-risks
sections of your home contents or office insurance, but these options are
unlikely to reimburse you for air-time misuse, and will not cover mechanical
breakdown and related expenses.

FT  21 AUG 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Shares gift to daughter
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IN 1991 I transferred shares, then valued at Pounds 6,000, to my daughter as
a gift. She sold them recently for Pounds 5,000. Will she be allowed to
establish a loss of Pounds 1,000 (plus indexation)? Or would she be reckoned
to have made a profit of Pounds 5,000 (less indexation) on the ground that
the original holding cost her nothing?
In 1984, I bought shares in Premier Oil Consolidated for Pounds 3,143. In
every subsequent year except 1992, I received bonus shares because the
company wanted to conserve resources for exploration rather than pay
dividends. Recently, I sold the original plus the bonus shares. For capital
gains tax purposes, would the basis be just the Pounds 3,143 plus
indexation? When you gave the shares to your daughter in 1991, you were
subject to CGT as though you had sold them in the open market at their
market value. Consequently, your daughter will have an allowable loss as
though she had bought them in the open market at that market value.
On Premier Oil, the cost remains at Pounds 3,143 plus indexation (subject to
adjustment for the 1985 rights offer). Ask your tax office for the free
pamphlets CGT-13 (The indexation allowance for quoted shares) and CGT-14
(Capital gains tax: an introduction).

FT  21 AUG 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Executors can benefit, too
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
CAN SOMEONE who benefits from a will also be an executor of it? Yes. In
simple cases, where you might wish to leave all your assets to one person,
this should not cause a problem. But you should be aware that if you wish to
leave your estate to a number of beneficiaries, one of whom is the executor,
then you must clearly have faith that this person will carry out your wishes
correctly in all respects. You might also wish to consider if you would like
a professional person as an executor to assist in these matters.

FT  21 AUG 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Offer was too good to miss
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CHANCE to replace some 5,000 BT2 shares with around 16,000 BT3 shares
(after scaling down) looked too good to miss. I duly succumbed to the
temptation. Can you advise me of the CGT position with regard to the switch
part of the operation?
2. Two thousand shares of the above allocation were purchased via the Pep
tender. On transferring these into Peps, I noticed that the transfer price
is calculated at 160p a share. Who benefits from the difference between this
and the present price, which is significantly higher?
You have a chargeable gain (or allowable loss) on the sale of your existing
holding of 5,000 shares. (The BT3 purchase does not affect that
calculation.) You are deemed to have paid for your new holding of 14,000
shares in full; if you sell them before you have, in fact, paid for them in
full, you will be deemed to have sold them for the actual sale price plus
the unpaid calls. (This does not apply to the 2,000 shares held in your
Pep). Ask your tax office for the free pamphlet CGT-13 (The indexation
allowance for quoted shares).
2. The difference in prices benefits you (provided that the price does not
effectively fall by the time you eventually sell the shares, of course). Ask
your tax office for the free pamphlet IR-89 (Personal equity plans).

FT  21 AUG 93 / Finance and the Family: Regular income from Pru
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PRUDENTIAL has launched a distribution bond designed to appeal to
investors who want a regular income. The fund, which will invest in gilts,
shares and property, will distribute its growth in the form of extra units.
These can be cashed-in to generate the income, or re-invested. Income can be
paid monthly, quarterly or half-yearly.
The first 5 per cent of income taken in a year will be tax-free. Basic rate
taxpayers can take out more than this without incurring a further tax
charge, since tax has been paid by the fund already.
Higher-rate taxpayers, however, may face a further charge - based on the
difference between basic rate and top rate tax - if they withdraw more than
5 per cent a year.
The success of Sun Life's distribution bond, which has produced an extremely
good investment performance over the past 10 years, is inspiring other
companies to enter the market.
The idea of getting extra units (rather than merely increasing the unit
price) seems to have appeal, although it is rather like getting a scrip
dividend instead of cash.
But the investment mix of these bonds, which tends to be somewhat on the
conservative side, produces a mixture of a decent yield plus the prospect of
some capital growth. It would be wrong, however, to assume that growth is
guaranteed as it is (with some limitations) on a with-profits bond. It is
possible for the unit price to fall and for the investor to lose money.
There is a 5 per cent bid-offer spread on the units to reflect the manager's
annual charge; there is also an initial charge of 1 per cent. The minimum
investment is Pounds 5,000; those who invest more than Pounds 10,000 will
get a 1 per cent bonus, which rises to 1.5 per cent for investments of over
Pounds 25,000 and 2 per cent for those of Pounds 50,000 and over.
Provident Life has launched a Guaranteed Escalator bond which offers 125 per
cent of the FT-SE 100 index's rise each year, with annual lock-in of gains.
The bond is designed for the personal pension market and has a minimum
investment of Pounds 10,000. A self-invested personal pension can be linked
to the bond.

FT  21 AUG 93 / Finance and the Family: The smallest tax haven - A look at
an under-exploited source of exemptions: children
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LOOKING FOR a tax haven? Thinking of an exotic faraway location like the
Caymans or Bermuda? Think again. The most economical tax shelter of all
could be sitting across the table from you eating Sugar Puffs.
Children are still an under-exploited source of tax exemptions, even though
the opportunities for financial family planning have been cut back in recent
years. From the moment of birth, every child is entitled to the same income
and capital gains tax allowances as an adult. Hence, in this tax year, a
child can receive income of Pounds 3,445 and make gains of Pounds 5,800
without paying tax. If a 40 per cent taxpayer can divert income and gains of
that magnitude to his child, the family will save a total of Pounds 3,698
(40 per cent of Pounds 3,445 plus Pounds 5,800).
This would be a beautifully simple way of being generous to your kids and
cocking a snook at the taxman simultaneously - were it not for one big snag.
The Inland Revenue anticipated the scope for tax avoidance and decreed,
years ago, that income transferred by a parent to an unmarried child under
18 would continue to be taxed as the parent's. A small concession is that
this rule is not invoked where the income arising in a financial year does
not exceed Pounds 100.
So, if a child's allowance is to be utilised, somebody other than mum and
dad will have to provide the cash. The prime candidates will usually be
grandparents, although donations from members of the extended family will no
doubt be equally welcome.
The ideal solution is for grandpa to transfer income-producing assets into a
trust for the benefit of his grandchildren. Provided the trust is structured
properly, the income can be applied to paying school fees or meeting other
living expenses, and the children's personal allowances can be utilised
fully.
If grandpa wants to hold on to his capital, though, the tax-saving
opportunity will be lost. It used to be possible to enter into a seven-year
deed of covenant, the effect of which was to transfer gross income to the
recipient, but the loophole was closed in 1988.
Another piece of tax legislation has made it a great deal more difficult to
take advantage of a child's CGT exemption. The usual rule is that a person
who gives away an asset is taxed as if he had sold it at market value. But
if both donor and donee agreed, the CGT liability could be 'held over.'
Basically, this means the donor pays no tax and the donee inherits the
donor's CGT base value.
Unfortunately, the categories of assets which can be held over have been
curtailed severely. Only shares or interests in private companies now
qualify - quoted shares and real estate do not. Hence, the old trick of
giving a child an asset which was 'pregnant' with capital gains, and
sheltering the gain inside the child's annual exemption, no longer works -
unless the parent owns some unquoted shares.
How else can the CGT exemption be utilised? One way would be to 'stag' new
issues on the child's behalf. Even if the funds are provided by a parent,
the gains will still be taxed as the child's: there is no CGT equivalent of
the rule nullifying the transfer of income.
If sufficient monies are available, investments can be made on the child's
behalf. The emphasis should be on low-cost products rather than more
expensive, tax-driven alternatives.
There is no point in paying for tax efficiency if the likely returns will be
sheltered by the youngster's exemptions, anyway. Logic points in favour of
something as straightforward as an investment trust savings scheme rather
than one of the more complex insurance-related products.
Since all these arrangements involve making gifts, the inheritance tax
implications will need to be considered. But IHT rarely will be a reason for
not proceeding with an otherwise tax-effective gift. Most gifts will be
potentially-exempt transfers, and those which are not should be covered by
annual and other exemptions or, as a last resort, the Pounds 150,000 nil
rate band.
Families planning to exploit their progeny's tax capacity must understand
that children have to be allowed to retain any cash or assets given to them.
Any attempt to set up a circular arrangement for the benefit of the parent
would fall foul of anti-avoidance guidelines laid down by the courts.

FT  21 AUG 93 / Finance and the Family: Keep an eye on friends - Diary of a
Private Investor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN GOLDSTEIN-JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EARLIER this month, I got a welcome pay-out. In 1983, my wife and I each
agreed to invest the maximum Pounds 240 a year in a family investment plan
with the Lancashire and Yorkshire assurance society. Part of it paid for
life cover while the rest was invested in a 'balanced portfolio.' According
to the promotional literature, this might produce for each of us a sum of
Pounds 4,661 after 10 years 'based on a gross rate of 12 per cent a year
compound growth.'
One of the main attractions of the plan was that, because the L &amp; Y is a
'wholly tax-exempt friendly society,' the sum paid out at the end of 10
years would be 'completely free from income tax, corporation tax,
higher-rate tax and capital gains tax.'
All seemed well until late last year when the society issued a statement
saying several problems had come to the attention of its new committee of
management. Perhaps the most serious was the revelation that Pounds 4.3m had
been lost on property deals by the society's Capital Secure fund.
Many of the policies based on this fund were written (in the society's
words) 'on a basis specifying the areas of investment in terms which did not
include property. These policies should not, therefore, have been exposed to
the loss on property investment which has, in fact, occurred.'
I was very concerned - especially when I checked my records and saw from the
original promotional literature that 50 per cent of the balanced portfolio
was supposed to be invested in Capital Secure (although, fortunately, the
other 50 per cent was to be invested in Gartmore's British trust which, over
the six-year period to January 1 1983, was reported to have returned 266 per
cent). The 50 per cent of the fund to be invested by L &amp; Y managers was said
to be in 'trustee status investments such as government securities and fixed
interest stocks.'
Capital Secure's property losses were not the only thing to alarm me. If it
was found that the society had to compensate the holders of those policies,
then, I wondered, how would that compensation be calculated? Would there be
a levy on its members, since a friendly society is owned by its
policy-holders? And since L &amp; Y is quite small - at the end of 1992, it only
had 71,541 policies in force - would it have to merge with another society?
The other problems with L &amp; Y were largely associated with uncertainties
over the tax treatment of various policies, although my own were not
affected. And, fortunately, the pay-outs my wife and I got this month were
Pounds 4,781.85 each - slightly more than the example cited originally.
Many of the uncertainties regarding the tax treatment of other people's
policies have now been resolved, and the High Court is expected to rule late
next month on compensation over the property losses. But, as JC Ramsden,
chairman of the society, pointed out in his statement to members in April
this year: 'The society together with its assets or liabilities does, by its
very nature, belong to all members. Thus, if a number of members seek
compensation against the society, in a sense they seek compensation against
themselves.'
(Personally, I would have hoped that any compensation could have been
recovered from the society's former managers and advisers who had permitted
a fund to invest in property when it was not supposed to.)
When the court hands down its ruling, various proposals are likely to be put
to members about the future of the society. The chairman has given
assurances that 'every option will be considered'.
As I have ceased to be a member, having taken the cash pay-out under my
policy rather than letting the society retain the funds for further
investment, I will not have a vote. But I do hope the society survives in
some form as I have been especially impressed with the way in which Ramsden
 -who was not on the board when the problems first arose - has tried to sort
them out.
Friendly societies have existed in one form or another for hundreds of
years, based on the proposition that groups of people should contribute to a
collective fund that will provide benefits to members in times of need. With
the government seeking a review of various aspects of the welfare state,
perhaps there will be an even greater role for these societies to play.

FT  21 AUG 93 / Finance and the Family: 'No-load' pioneer passes the
performance test - A look at a fund which does not make an initial charge /
Unit Trusts: Lazard's European Growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CONCEPT of a 'no-load' fund, a collective equity vehicle without an
initial charge, is common in the US. In the UK, such funds are still rare,
with the norm being initial charges of 5-6 per cent.
One UK fund management group which has blazed a trail is Lazard, which
abolished the initial charge on its trusts in 1988. Such a charging
structure can make quite a difference to investors. The bid-offer spread on
Lazard's European Growth fund on August 1 was just 0.88 per cent; on the
average European trust, the spread was 5.91 per cent. That means an investor
who puts Pounds 100 into the Lazard trust had Pounds 99.12 of his money
working for him; in the average European trust, that sum would be just
Pounds 94.09.
Many in the unit trust industry argue that charges are a relatively
unimportant issue. What really matters, in their view, is performance.
Lazard's European Growth trust does not fall down on that score. According
to Micropal, it was second out of 92 European unit trusts over the five
years to August 1, with growth of 129.8 per cent (offer-to-bid with income
reinvested).
The trust's record is consistent. It is fifth (out of 120 funds) over three
years, growing by 24.8 per cent and 16th (out of 128) funds over one year,
with a return of 28.1 per cent.
The European Growth trust was set up in October 1986. 'We previously had
trusts for in-house clients but we did not have an authorised vehicle which
could be sold directly to the public' says Patricia Maxwell-Arnot, who has
managed the trust since launch.
The strong performance has helped to attract investors, although the fund
does not pay commission. When launched, the fund had just under Pounds 3m
under management; it has now passed the Pounds 100m mark.
Like the Schroder UK Enterprise fund, covered in last week's issue, Lazard
European Growth invests in a limited number of stocks - 44 at present. But
whereas the Schroder fund sees this concentration as part of its
'aggressive' approach, Lazard's Maxwell-Arnot says 'We see ourselves as
risk-averse prudent investors. We think about the downside as much as the
upside.'
'The big danger of investment is buying things and then finding you can't
sell them,' adds Maxwell-Arnot. 'Accordingly, we focus on marketability and
opt for large markets, and large stocks.'
In terms of stock selection, Maxwell-Arnot says: 'We are looking for
companies which are undervalued, because if something is cheap, the downside
is limited. We look at valuation measures such as price to cashflow and
price to book (asset value) rather than at price-earnings ratios. The
turnover of our fund is very low.' She adds: 'We identify shares which are
good value and stick with them.'
The largest 10 holdings are: SIP (the Italian telecoms group), UBS (the
Swiss bank), Deutsche Bank (the German bank), ABN-Amro Bank (the Dutch
bank), Axa (the French insurance group), Roche (the Swiss pharmaceuticals
group), Schering (the German chemicals and pharmaceuticals group), BMW (the
German car maker), Bayer (the German chemicals company) and Valeo (the
French car components group).
The top 10 shows a concentration of financial companies, which Maxwell-Arnot
believes will benefit from falling interest rates. Some stocks such as UBS
have already risen sharply, but she says 'it is still cheaply rated relative
to other banks and in terms of quality is one of the best in Europe.'
Other selections fit the Lazard criteria for undervaluation. SIP is seen as
exceptionally cheap at a price of 1.5 times cashflow. Maxwell-Arnot says
Schering is priced at seven times cashflow which she sees as a very cheap
rating for a company which has declared it is going to sell off its
non-pharmaceutical interests.
In terms of geographical allocation, the fund is overweight in Switzerland
(19.4 per cent of the portfolio), Netherlands (13.5 per cent), and France
(27 per cent). The rest of the portfolio is split between Germany (20.2 per
cent), Italy (9.1 per cent), Spain (4.2 per cent), Sweden (3.2 per cent) and
Belgium (2.8 per cent).
Maxwell-Arnot says: 'Our biggest underweight position has been in
Scandinavia,' - a strategy which has not proved helpful to the fund's
performance but which flows from the trust's concentration on Europe's
larger markets.
Looking ahead, Maxwell-Arnot is bullish about the prospects for European
equities. 'On a price-to-cashflow ratio, European markets look very cheap
relative to the US and the UK. European equities also look cheap relative to
bonds.'
'French interest rates will come down, as reality dawns on PM Balladur.
Rates are too high, given the level of unemployment and the state of the
economy.' Across Europe, she argues that the low yields on cash and bonds
will cause the valuations of stocks to rise.
Charges. As highlighted above, the fund has no initial charge. The annual
charge is 1.5 per cent. The minimum investment in the fund is quite high, by
industry standards, at Pounds 5,000. The trust is Pepable, but Lazard has no
specific plan attached to it.

John Charcol, mortgage broker, says that since many people think that base
rates may be cut, it is offering a mortgage, combining a capped rate
followed by a fixed rate. The capped rate is 4.95 per cent (APR 8.1) until
September 1994 (for loans under 75 per cent of the purchase price) and 5.95
per cent for larger loans.
The fixed rate will be 7.99 per cent (8.1 APR) until September 1997. There
are no compulsory insurances, the offer is available on all types of
mortgage and it is portable. The application fee is Pounds 250 and the
redemption penalty is four months interest.
Fixed rate mortgages are still popular and Woolwich building society has
brought out a rate of 6.4 per cent (8.1 APR) for first-time buyers only,
fixed for two years for an application fee of Pounds 225. Existing
homeowners can opt for a three-year 6.95 per cent deal (8.1 APR) and a
five-year 7.5 per cent rate. The fees are Pounds 250 for the first and
Pounds 275 for the second. Fixed rates are available on all types of
mortgage and are portable.
Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester has a portable three- year mortgage fixed at 7.25
per cent (8.2 APR) for a minimum deposit of 10 per cent from new borrowers.
The application fee is Pounds 250 and the mortgage is available on repayment
or interest-only loans. C &amp; G is offering a 2 percentage point reduction off
its standard variable rate (making the rate 5.99 per cent) for new borrowers
who have a 25 per cent deposit. Those with a 10 per cent deposit can have a
reduction of 1 percentage point. The discount lasts 12 months.
National &amp; Provincial building society is also offering discounts off its
variable rate of 7.99 per cent but to first-time buyers. Those borrowing up
to 75 per cent of the property's purchase price will get a reduction of

WITH THE stock market continuing to rise, sales of shares by directors
continue to outweigh purchases, although the volume this week is
substantially lower than last.
Shares in Savills have recovered steadily since Geoffrey van Cutsem bought
20,000 at 30.5p in January. This week, he was among eight directors selling
a total of 1.56m at a price of 52p.
Since coming to the market in July last year, shares in Anglian Group, a
building materials company, have risen by more than 70 per cent. At the time
of flotation, it was announced that when the price reached a certain level,
the four executive directors of the company would reduce their holdings.
They have now sold 975,000 shares.
The share price of St James Place Capital has risen steadily over the past
year and Nils Taube and Clive Gibson have reduced their holdings by 791,963
and 500,000 (to 5,014,254 and 1,919,810) respectively.
These sales follow purchases at 137p by Sir Mark Weinberg, the joint
chairman, and Anthony Leonis at the end of July, just after the company said
it would acquire International Financial Markets, a London-based investment
manager.
The sale of 850,000 shares in British Land by John Ritblat followed the
purchase of 2m shares at a price of 298p from Quantum Partners, the
investment vehicle of George Soros, the currency speculator and
international investor, as was agreed at the start of June this year.

FT  21 AUG 93 / Finance and the Family: Your CGT allowances
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TABLE shows capital gains tax allowances for assets sold in July.
Multiply the original cost of the asset by the figure shown for the month in
which you bought it. Subtract the results from the proceeds of your sale and
the balance will be your taxable gain or loss.
Suppose that you bought shares for Pounds 5,000 in August 1984 and sold them
in July 1993 for Pounds Pounds 13,000. Multiplying the original cost by the
August 1984 figure of 1.564 gives a total of Pounds 7,820.
Subtracting that from the Pounds 13,000 gives a capital gain of Pounds
5,180, which is below the 1993-94 CGT allowance of Pounds 5,800. If you are
selling shares bought before April 6 1982, you should use the March 1982
figure.
The RPI in July was 140.7.

WH Smith, the national newsagent and retailer, is expected to report on
Wedesday pre-tax profits for the year ended May 31 down slightly from Pounds
113m a year earlier.
Profits will be better, or at least static, in all divisions except the Do
it All DIY joint venture with Boots. The losses there are likely to rise to
about Pounds 12m from Pounds 2.7m a year earlier, reflecting price
competition in the sector and the venture's problems. Smiths might lift the
final dividend from the previous year's 9.1p but the market is not taking
this for granted.
Interim profits at Guardian Royal Exchange, to be announced on Thursday,
should be in line with the three composites already announced. Some Pounds
65m is expected, against losses of Pounds 39m last time, indicating the
recovery of UK underwriting. However, under FRS 3, investment gains will now
be included above the line, resulting in a maximum headline figure of Pounds
155m.
Medeva, the UK drugs company which had its stock market value slashed from
Pounds 589m to Pounds 295m in July following a warning that full-year
profits would be some Pounds 10m less than expected after overstocking in
the US, unveils its interim results on Tuesday. Analysts are unwilling to
estimate how much of the shortfall will occur in the first half. Between
Pounds 16m and Pounds 18m has been tentatively pencilled in this time,
against Pounds 14.1m last.
Rentokil, the environmental and property services company whose hostile
Pounds 75.7m bid for Securiguard, the security and cleaning group, was
recommended in July, reports interim results on Thursday. Profits of between
Pounds 63m and Pounds 64m pre-tax are expected, though last time's Pounds
51.5m will be restated for FRS 3 and the group is also moving to average,
rather than period-end, exchange rate calculations. The dividend could rise
from 0.64p to 0.78p.

FT  21 AUG 93 / Finance and the Family: Free hand on mortgages - A look at
the growing demand for interest-only home loans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MORTGAGE market is dominated by endowment and repayment loans, which
together account for 85 per cent of new sales. But growing numbers of
house-buyers are looking for interest-only mortgages where borrowers are
free to choose the type of investment to repay the capital when the mortgage
term ends.
Figures from the Building Societies Association indicate the increased
popularity of interest-only loans, which have leapt from only 4 per cent of
all new mortgages in 1991 to 14 per cent in the first quarter of 1993. The
gain seems to be mainly at the expense of endowments.
These figures must, however, be treated with caution because of a change in
the way the BSA collects them. It now asks lenders for a more detailed
breakdown of the interest-only mortgages they sell (the categories being
endowment, Pep, pension and interest-only).
As a result, it believes that part of the apparent increase in interest-only
mortgages sold is due to endowments simply being recorded under a new
heading.
Strictly speaking, an endowment is an interest-only mortgage, since the
borrower pays only interest during the life of the loan. The premiums go to
a life office, which invests the money (with some life cover thrown in) with
the aim of repaying the capital at the end of the term.
Most endowment mortgages are sold as one product, though. The borrower takes
out the loan but the endowment part is arranged by the bank or building
society in what is usually an exclusive distribution agreement with a single
life office.
Similarly, some banks and building societies link mortgages directly to Peps
and pension plans. But it is much harder to find a pure interest-only
mortgage where the lender lets you decide the type of savings method.
These were more common in the 1980s when people assumed that inflation and
steeply-rising house prices would reduce the capital sum to an easily
affordable amount when they came to repay it 25 years later. But many
lenders now regard such loans as too risky.
'We believe it is only rarely appropriate for either a lender or borrower to
take on a substantial loan commitment without a clearly identified and
allocated mechanism or resource for repayment,' says Geoff Ellerton,
director of Midland bank's mortgage services.
'An interest-only mortgage is, in principle, an unmatched liability which
creates significant additional risk for the borrower and dependants.'
Along with several banks and building societies, Midland will grant such a
mortgage only on a case-by-case basis. This will usually mean lending to an
older borrower, who is assumed to be more financially aware or responsible
than a first-time buyer, or on a second property which can be sold if
necessary to meet the commitment.
Sometimes, the interest-only loan will be granted only if a large deposit is
available or, paradoxically, on large loans - again, on the assumption that
the borrower will be sophisticated about arranging a repayment plan.
Halifax building society, the UK's largest lender, offers interest-only
mortgages on a minimum loan of Pounds 100,000 and gives a maximum advance of
90 per cent of the property's valuation.
It requires some kind of security or backing and says that the very
flexibility of interest-only mortgages makes them 'a very niche market for
those people who may have other types of investments besides the more
traditional one.'
Bristol &amp; West says that if the only security is the the property, it will
restrict the loan to the society's basic advance - which is 75 per cent for
loans under Pounds 50,000.
Lloyds bank follows a policy similar to Midland's in that it looks at
individual cases before deciding whether to grant an interest-only mortgage.
Customers must usually be aged at least 45 and the loan must be repaid by
the main income-earner's retirement age (or 65 years, if earlier).
The bank would not normally offer a loan for more than 50 per cent of a
property's value.
The Leeds will grant pure interest-only loans, but at one percentage point
above the society's standard variable rate. The premium is waived for
maturity loans to the elderly. National Westminster bank and Royal Bank of
Scotland do not offer such mortgages at all
By contrast, some lenders have made a virtue out of offering interest-only
loans. Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester building society - which announced last week
it would no longer sell insurance products - has concentrated on providing
interest-only and repayment mortgages since 1990. Bradford &amp; Bingley
building society also provides interest-only loans.
The market for these mortgages is not as restricted as it might seem, since
many lenders offering pension or Pep mortgages will give advice on repayment
methods but do not insist that these are used to repay the loan at the end
of the term.
Ian Darby, of mortgage broker John Charcol, says: 'With a lot of lenders,
you end up with an interest-only loan through the back door, since the
lender does not take assignment of the policy.'
This is both good and bad. It is a welcome development that there should be
more ways than an endowment to repay an interest-only loan.
The down-side is that irresponsible borrowers, or those with little
financial discipline, may find themselves in severe financial difficulty if
they do not set up a long-term savings plan.

FT  21 AUG 93 / Finance and the Family: Rising equities bring share-linked
BES - A look at the latest schemes on offer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RISE in the UK stock market has coincided with an increase in the number
of new business expansion schemes offering market-linked returns. Sponsors,
having discovered this innovation, are offering it alongside conventional,
cash-backed, arranged exit schemes.
Sponsors Close Brothers and Save &amp; Prosper this week launched BESSA
Oxbridge, which aims to raise Pounds 38.75m to buy properties from five
colleges - Merton at Oxford, and Christ's, Jesus, Sidney Sussex and Wolfson
at Cambridge - and let them to students on an assured tenancy basis. The
colleges say they will buy back the properties after the five-year period
required for BES investment.
Investors are being offered a choice of three separate companies in which to
invest. The first is a straightforward, cash-backed, fixed return scheme of
121p after five years for every 100p invested, equating to an annual return
of 13.9 per cent for higher-rate taxpayers (9.5 per cent for
lower-ratepayers).
Returns from the other two companies are linked to rises in the FT-SE 100
but one option is geared. This offers the potential for higher returns but
is riskier.
The second set of companies gives a fixed exit price of 81.4p (equating to
an annualised return of 5.8 per cent for a higher-rate taxpayer) and 1p for
every 1 per cent increase in the FT-SE up to August 1998. There is a lock-in
if it rises by 39.6 per cent, which would produce 121p a share.
The third, and only geared, option offers investors their 60p back after
five years so that, at worst, higher-rate taxpayers keep their original
investment. The variable return, however, is 1.54p a share for every 1 per
cent rise in the FT-SE.
The company you choose depends on the level of risk you are willing to
accept and the level to which you believe the FT-SE will rise over the
five-year period.
To reduce risk, the closing level of the FT-SE will be averaged over the
final six-month period. But you would be entering the market at an all-time
high (if the present level of the index is sustained until September), and
future rises may not match those of the past.
The FT-SE would have to reach around 4,280 in five years' time from present
levels in order to make the 40 per cent rise.
BESt Investment, the intermediary and adviser, says that since properties
will not be acquired until February, the sponsors will have to be quick in
getting BES 3 certificates to investors who need them to claim tax relief if
their tax coding is to be changed for the end of the tax year.
'The First Series companies offer an attractive fixed return together with
excellent security,' according to BESt. 'The FT-SE linked companies do have
the benefit of a lock-in, but at a rather higher level than we would have
preferred.'
Oxford alumni may be attracted by the Balliol and Magdalen Colleges launched
by sponsor Hodgson Martin late last week. The Gilt-Edged Companies offer a
cash-backed, fixed exit price of 121p. The FT-SE Companies offers a 60p
fixed return plus 1.6p for every 1 per cent rise in the FT-SE. There is a
lock-in of gains after a 25 per cent rise and a 50 per cent rise in the
FT-SE.
Gilt-Edged Companies is backed by gilts held in favour of the BES companies
but the backing for the FT-SE Companies is from an unnamed 'financial
institution.'
'It is worrying that the financial institution providing the FT-SE 100 index
Notes is not specified although it is stated that whoever does write the
Notes will have a minimum long-term credit rating by Moody's of A1,'
according to Investment Analysis, which is published by the British
Taxpayers Association.
The minimum investment for these BES issues is Pounds 2,000.
Meanwhile, investors in National Westminster bank's Homeshare scheme and
BZW's Gracechurch companies face a further period of uncertainty. The Inland
Revenue said at the end of last week that it would be appealing against the
High Court judgment reversing its decision that the schemes were ineligible
for tax relief.
The two issues had been caught by the Budget deadline abolishing loan-back
schemes because the sponsors had allotted shares but had not listed the
shareholdings in the companies' register of members in time.
BZW has said that its owner, Barclays bank, will make the loan back
available from mid-September. However, investors who choose to take the
loan, risk losing their tax relief if the High Court decision is overturned.
The two banks have said that they will give customers their original
investment back but this may not be enough to satisfy disappointed
investors.

FT  21 AUG 93 / Finance and the Family: A safety net for the cautious
investor - Guaranteed equity bonds seem to offer growth - or your money
back. But, it is not that simple . . .
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SAFETY IS very important to most investors, and the word 'guarantee' usually
provokes a positive reaction. That might explain the proliferation of
guaranteed equity bonds which offer a simple slogan: 'Stock market growth
without risk.'
Most people know they 'ought' to invest in equities because of the long-term
gains which can be made. But they are all too aware of how volatile stock
markets can be. They fear that investing at the wrong time, such as just
before the crash of 1987, could result in losing capital. And with the FT-SE
100 index setting a record high this week, they could have extra reason to
be cautious.
Guaranteed products provide the reassurance some people need. In most cases,
the worst that can happen is that they get back their original sum invested.
The product can take the form of a building society account, in which the
'interest' is stock market growth, or it can be an insurance bond such as
the one launched recently by National Westminster. This offers investors the
rise in the FT-SE 100 index over five years, or the return of their original
investment, whichever is the greater.
As an additional attraction, it offers a 'lock-in facility.' If the Footsie
rises by 25 per cent from its original level at any point over the five
years, that gain will be 'locked in.' Even if the market falls, the investor
will receive a minimum return of 25 per cent. (The minimum investment is
Pounds 5,000). Then, too, a basic rate-payer will face no extra tax when the
bond matures.
Add these factors together and it sounds like a flawless product. But
guaranteed equity bonds have a number of disadvantages which are not always
immediately apparent. Inflation. A guarantee that returns your original
capital in five years is not necessarily a good deal, since your capital
will buy less. At 5 per cent inflation, Pounds 1 is worth 78p after five
years.
Loss of interest. Instead of putting your money in the bond, you could have
put the same sum in the building society and enjoyed the benefits of
compound interest. If you had earned 5 per cent interest net, Pounds 1,000
would have grown to Pounds 1,276 after five years.
Lack of income. Most guaranteed equity bonds pay all their return on
maturity; thus, they are of little use to income-seeking investors. Some do
pay 'income,' but there is a risk that this might represent merely the
return of the original capital (see below) .
Loss of dividend yield. The Footsie reflects only the capital growth of
share prices, not the dividend yield - for which most guaranteed bonds do
not give credit. With shares yielding 3.7 per cent now, losing the dividend
yield over five years makes a significant difference. An investment in an
indexed unit trust would give the holder credit for both the capital growth
and the dividend yield on the index (although this would be somewhat diluted
by the manager's charges).
Misleading percentages. Some products, particularly those sold by building
societies, may offer to return more than the rise in the Footsie. But this
'extra' percentage is available only to non-taxpayers. A bond which offers a
133 per cent rise in the index to gross investors will pay only 100 per cent
to basic rate-payers.
Higher-rate taxpayers. Although basic rate-payers face no additional charge
on most guaranteed equity bonds, higher rate-payers could pay the difference
between basic and top-rate tax on encashment. In the above example, a bond
that offered 133 per cent of the rise in the index to non-taxpayers would
pay only 80 per cent to higher rate-payers.
Furthermore, proceeds from the bonds are taxed as income. For those top
rate-payers who do not use up their annual Pounds 5,800 capital gains tax
allowance, this makes them less attractive than an indexed unit trust.
Fixed holding periods. In most cases, the bonds last for five years and
investors may well not get the full value of their investment if they
withdraw their money before the period is up.
Given these factors, sophisticated investors will probably reason along the
following lines. The stock market probably will rise over a five-year
period. If it does, an indexed unit trust (or an actively-managed fund with
a proven record) could well outperform a guaranteed equity bond, because of
the dividend yield and, in some cases, the tax position. If the stock market
falls, it would be better to invest in the building society (or gilts) and
earn an income than to rely on the money-back guarantee.
There are, however, a lot more people who would regard themselves as
'amateur' rather than sophisticated investors and, for them, guaranteed
bonds will continue to appeal.
The financial sector has been alert to many of the problems, and a number of
the bonds on the market are designed to overcome some of the perceived
disadvantages.
Scottish Amicable has produced the third issue of its Capital Guarantee bond
which allows for the growth in the FT-SE 100, including the re-investment of
dividends. This addition comes at a cost; there is an initial charge of 5
per cent as well as a 5 per cent bid-offer spread. Allowing for a bonus
allocation of units for those who invest before September 10, this means
that, of an initial investment of Pounds 10,000, only about Pounds 9,160
will rise in line with the index. Further, there is an annual charge of 1.5
per cent which is deducted from the dividend income.
So it is quite a complex calculation as to whether this structure will be
more profitable than a more straightforward bond which lacks the dividend
facility. If you assume that the market yields 4 per cent and that dividends
and share prices grow by a steady 5 per cent per year, I calculate that the
Scottish Amicable bond would be ahead of the NatWest product. But different
assumptions would produce a different result.
Lock-in facilities appear particularly popular: more than 70 per cent of the
investors in Save &amp; Prosper's first guaranteed bond, launched last November,
opted for this benefit. Indeed, the first lock-in took effect after the
FT-SE rose 10 per cent to reach its recent record high.
Save &amp; Prosper plans to launch a new bond on September 1. This will offer
the choice of 98 per cent of your capital rising in line with the Footsie,
or 90 per cent rising in line with lock-ins at 20, 30 and 40 per cent
growth.
The lock-in facilities on Scottish Mutual's Guaranteed Investment plan
differ from those on the S &amp; P bond; Scottish Mutual offers to lock in gains
once the index has risen by 50, 75 and 100 per cent. This might sound better
than the S &amp; P deal but much depends on how optimistic you are about the
market; if it rises 49 per cent but then falls back, S &amp; P investors will
get a lock-in but Scottish Mutual investors will not. The more cautious you
are about equities, the better it is to have a low lock-in level.
Scottish Mutual's bond uses the average level of the Footsie over the last
year of the product's life as the measure of the investor's gain: S &amp; P uses
the average over the last six months. This technique protects against a
sudden fall in the index just before maturity; on the other hand, since
equities tend to rise over time, the averaging could well reduce the overall
return.
There is a 5 per cent initial charge, which means only 95 per cent of your
money benefits from the rise in the index. But those who invest before
September 3 will qualify for a 'bonus' of 2 per cent which will reduce the
impact of the initial charge. Minimum investment is Pounds 7,500.
One twist on the guaranteed product which is proving popular is the income
facility. Rather than guarantee to pay back the original capital, some
companies offer to pay a fixed income over the five years. The 'guarantee'
that then applies is that the company will pay a residual lump sum which,
together with the income payments, returns the original investment.
Say a person invests Pounds 10,000 to earn an income of 8 per cent a year.
The bond would pay Pounds 800 for five years (total Pounds 4,000) and then
guarantee that the minimum repayment value after five years would be Pounds
6,000. The stock market normally would have to grow at a set percentage for
the investor to get back his original capital as well as the income.
Save &amp; Prosper offers another bond which pays 8.5 per cent income (paid
quarterly or annually) over five years. The bond-holder gets a minimum of
57.5 per cent of the original investment on maturity. To get back Pounds
10,000, the Footsie would have to rise 30 per cent over the five years. The
minimum investment is Pounds 2,500 (Pounds 5,000 for those who want
quarterly income).
The nature of these products has attracted criticism, mainly on the ground
that investors could be misled by the high 'income' on offer and fail to
understand that this might simply represent the return of their capital. But
Save &amp; Prosper says it surveyed investors who bought an earlier income bond
and found that 91 per cent felt the literature made the risks to capital
clear.
Business expansion schemes also are offering returns based on the Footsie's
growth (for details, see the article on Page IV). It seems clear that
guaranteed equity products are here to stay, and that there will be more
variations as the 1990s progress.

FT  21 AUG 93 / Markets: New York discovers the rest of the world - Wall
Street
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN NORMAL times, the global perspective of US investors is pretty narrow.
Events overseas rarely have much of an impact on the financial markets at
home, which traditionally keep their focus on domestic economic news,
internal money-flows, and the economic and monetary policies of the
country's politicians and central bankers.
These are not normal times, however, and this week shock waves from a
ministerial meeting in Tokyo, a sharp widening in the US trade deficit, a
dramatic drop in the value of the dollar against the Japanese yen followed
by an equally dramatic recovery, and record-breaking rises in European
equity markets, buffeted US financial markets.
On Wednesday, big gains in European equity markets provided the fuel for a
sharp rally in US stocks. This sent the Dow Jones Industrial Average above
3,600 for the first time in its history. This was unusual, because US
equities do not normally follow the European markets. Typically, it is the
other way around.
Yet this week, US investors took their cue from their European counterparts,
primarily because they shared the same hope - that falling interest rates in
Europe will boost flagging economies. In the case of US investors, the
flagging economy which they hope will benefit from lower interest rates in
Germany, France, Spain and elsewhere is the US economy. Their thinking goes
that an improved business climate on the other side of the Atlantic will
revive demand for US goods and services.
(This symbiotic relationship between US and European markets worked
especially well this week. Not only did buoyant UK, German and Spanish
equities lift US shares at the New York opening, but early strength in US
markets provided UK, German and Spanish stocks with a lift late in the
European day.)
If equity investors' newly-found international sophistication was on display
on Wednesday, it was bond investors' turn to adopt the global perspective on
Thursday.
It all started in Tokyo, where Morihiro Hosokawa, Japan's new prime
minister, held the first meeting of a special ministerial council on the
economy. At the meeting, the council agreed to draw up an emergency
programme aimed at deregulating the Japanese economy and shifting the
balance of power in the country from producer to consumer.
After the meeting, Hosokawa spoke on the telephone to President Bill
Clinton. Economists in New York and Tokyo suspect that the two leaders
struck a secret agreement during their talk - a deal that Japan will take
action to spur domestic economic growth and open up the Japanese market more
to US goods, and in return the US will take action to halt the dollar's
slide against the yen, and perhaps expend less energy talking the US
currency down.
The conversation between Hosokawa and Clinton took on so much significance
(and set the rumour mills grinding) because of what happened later that
Thursday morning. First, the June US merchandise trade deficit was released,
showing an unexpected and dramatic 44 per cent rise in the deficit to
Dollars 12.06bn, the largest for almost six years.
Then, also out of the blue, the New York Federal Reserve began intervening
in the foreign exchange markets to protect the dollar, which was taking a
pounding from currency dealers who had begun selling dollars and buying yen
as soon as the awful trade numbers were announced.
In a remarkably effective piece of central bank intervention, the Fed's
intercession halted the dollar's slide towards Y100, and dragged it back
above Y105.
Bond investors, meanwhile, watched all of this with undisguised glee. They
liked the trade figures, which indicated that the US economy has been
growing at an even slower rate than everyone thought. Indeed, many analysts
said the sharp drop in June exports would almost certainly force the
government to revise its original estimate of second-quarter gross domestic
product growth. Initially put at 1.6 per cent - a modest expansion in the
first place - analysts now think the GDP growth rate will be brought down to
around 0.5 per cent.
Treasury investors also welcomed the Fed's attempts to halt the dollar's
decline. This is because if overseas investors believe the US currency is
about to turn, then they will begin investing more of their money in
Treasury bonds in the expectation of benefiting from the appreciating
relative value of US assets.
All of this sounds complicated, which it is. Yet, this week ended with US
stock markets at or near record highs, the biggest European stock markets at
or near record highs, and US bond yields at record lows. Somebody,
somewhere, seems to like what's going on.

 -At a glance
</HEADLINE>

LENDING for new mortgages remains uneven, according to figures released by
the Building Societies Association this week. Net new commitments fell to
Pounds 2.9bn in July reversing a rise the previous month. In July last year,
net new commitments were higher at Pounds 3.4bn but buyers were then rushing
to beat the August deadline reimposing stamp duty on house purchases up to
Pounds 250,000. Adrian Coles, director-general of the BSA said he expected
levels of lending activity to be broadly maintained over the coming months.
On the savings side, building societies suffered a net outflow of funds in
July as people withdrew money to pay for holidays, L-registration cars and
BT3 shares. The net outflow of Pounds 61m followed an outflow of Pounds 56m
in June.

FT  21 AUG 93 / Markets: Drugs emerge from a coma - The Bottom Line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER A year of apparently slipping into an ever deeper coma, drugs stocks
jerked awake this week. The health and household sector, dominated by drug
stocks Glaxo, SmithKline Beecham and Wellcome, recorded its steepest rise of
the year and recovered to its best level for two and a half months.
The immediate stimuli were the record breaking rally in the rest of the
market, a drug approval in the US for Glaxo and some conciliatory words from
US President Bill Clinton, whose administration is determined to limit drug
bills.
Expert opinion is divided over whether the effects are just temporary: will
the sector embark on the road to recovery or will it suffer a relapse?
By any account, the shares remain weak. From having been the star sector of
the 1980s, they languish at a deep discount to the rest of the market even
after the latest gains.
The problem is that drug prices and profit margins remain under pressure.
The Clinton administration and cash hungry governments in Europe and Japan
argue that drug bills have been rising too quickly and must be controlled.
President Clinton's plans seem likely to involve more intervention by
government to cut costs. They could include the provision of universal
healthcare coverage and the establishment of health 'alliances' that would
push for healthcare plans to cut their charges.
Already, the fear of legislation may have contributed to a fall in drug
price inflation in the US towards the level of general inflation.
Some investors fear that the squeeze on drugs will not stop there.
Healthcare reforms in the US, easily the world's biggest market, promise to
cut the number of drug buyers through Health Insurance Purchasing
Co-operatives. These will have greater buying power and therefore the
ability to strike discount deals with drug makers.
Lehman Brothers is one of the leading pessimists of the sector. It argues
that only UK and European investors have been buying drug company shares
this week and they do not understand the implications of Clinton's plans as
well as US investors.
It also fears there is a chance Glaxo will lose a patent case in the US over
its best selling drug Zantac. Sales of Zantac, an ulcer treatment, are worth
about Dollars 3.5bn a year. If Glaxo lost, other companies would be able to
sell a generic (unbranded) version from 1995. Ian Smith, a drug sector
analyst at broker Lehman Brothers in London, estimates that Glaxo would then
lose Dollars 700m of revenue in the first year alone.
Even the uncertainty over law suits and regulation alone has been depressing
share prices. At least one broker was talking this week of a 'black hole' in
the pricing of drugs. No wonder that the drug sector, once the most
expensive in the London market, is now trading at a price/earnings ratio of
about 6 per cent below the market average even after this week's gains.
In the face of this apparently overwhelming evidence, it is hard to hear the
voices of the sector's optimists, however persuasive their arguments seem.
They say that investors have been unwitting pawns in a political game being
played by the drug companies to limit the damage government will inflict on
them.
The drug industry is churning out bad news items in an effort to portray
itself as vulnerable. At the same time it is less than enthusiastic about
presenting events which bolster its image.
One broker has produced a stack of statistics to show that proposed US
healthcare changes will cut drug prices mostly for the working population,
not for the very young or old, its main customers.
It even predicts that Glaxo can survive losing its patent suit virtually
unscathed by cutting costs.
This broker is, however, not prepared to be publicly associated with these
views. It was overwhelmed by buying orders earlier in the week and is still
struggling to buy drug sector shares while they are still close to their
lows.

FT  21 AUG 93 / Markets: Where to put your trust - Serious Money
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
INVESTMENT trusts have rarely been so healthy. Over the past year, while the
sector's assets have grown by 48 per cent, the average share price has risen
by 61 per cent, according to NatWest.
The result is that the average discount in the investment trust sector has
fallen to its narrowest level, at 8.7 per cent, since 1972, according to S G
Warburg. The FT Investment Trust index also hit an all-time high. At this
point, a good contrarian has to argue; have things gone too far?
Certainly experienced sector watchers, such as Hamish Buchan of NatWest
Securities, find much at which to marvel. 'The discount on Foreign &amp;
Colonial (the largest trust in the sector) is just 1.3 per cent' he says.
'If you had mentioned that possibility to F&amp;C 10 years ago, they would have
laughed.'
At least Foreign &amp; Colonial is still at a discount. On Friday morning,
shares in Templeton Emerging Markets were trading at a 17.6 per cent
premium; much as one might admire the investment skills of Mark Mobius, the
Templeton manager, it is hard to see why you should pay Pounds 117.60 to buy
Pounds 100 of assets. The shares could fall 15 per cent and still be trading
at asset value.
Why has this been happening? With the share market reaching new highs,
investment trusts represent a quick and efficient way for private investors,
and some small institutions, to put money into shares. Furthermore, the
regular drip-feed of savings schemes appears to have been steadily narrowing
the discount over the years.
A further factor is that the number of trusts which are either geographical
specialists, or have a split capital structure, has increased. Such funds
tend not to trade at a wide discount, because in the case of the former,
they offer institutions something they cannot replicate on their own and, in
the case of the latter, they offer the private investor tax advantages.
But can the situation continue? Hamish Buchan says: 'Some people think the
discount has gone for ever. I don't believe that to be the case. The sector
looks a bit toppy at the moment.'
The worst that could happen is a sudden fall in the market. Institutions
might sell their holdings as a way of reducing exposure to the market and
private investors might lose confidence in equities. Those still invested
might suffer a 'double whammy' as assets fall and the discount widens.
All this might tilt the odds in the long-standing argument over whether
investment trusts or unit trusts are better for the private investor. The
main arguments in favour of investment trusts have been threefold: costs are
lower; ability to gear up through borrowing should enhance returns over the
long run; and it is possible to buy their assets at a discount.
But some of those arguments have been undermined. The costs of the
investment trust sector have been steadily rising. Some new issues absorb 4
to 5 per cent of the proceeds in expenses (close to the 5 per cent initial
charge on a unit trust). Some savings schemes also pay 3 per cent commission
to intermediaries, a charge which is passed to the investor.
With markets at all-time highs, the fact that a trust is geared might
concern cautious investors, as might the ability of trust shares to move to
a wider discount.
Take the example of a investment trust at a 5 per cent premium, and a unit
trust with a 5 per cent initial charge. Although the bid-offer spread on the
unit trust will be wider than 5 per cent, there will also be a bid-offer
spread on the investment trust shares, plus stamp duty, and, if you do not
buy via a savings scheme, brokers' commission.
Unit trust annual charges tend to be higher on average, but it is possible
to cherry pick. For example, Gartmore's UK Index fund, with no initial
charge and a 0.5 per cent annual charge, might represent better value than
some UK general investment trusts.
In sectors such as emerging markets, a unit trust trading at asset value
might represent better value than an investment trust at a double digit
premium. (Although, for the moment, unit trusts are restricted in the
markets where they can invest, so they might not be as genuinely 'emerging'
as their investment trust rivals).
There is no perfect answer to the issue of unit versus investment trusts.
Much will depend on an individual's attitude to risk. Lewis Aaron of SG
Warburg Securities points out that in a market fall, investment trusts,
being closed-ended funds, will be able to sit tight, while unit trust
managers will have to sell holdings to meet redemptions.
A footnote to my piece last week on price-earnings ratios. Gerald Ashfield,
who has been active in the investment trust industry since the 1940s, says
that the ratio he follows most closely is the link between the earnings
yield and the yield on irredeemable government stocks, such as War Loan. The
earnings yield is calculated by dividing corporate earnings by share prices
and is thus effectively the inverse of the price-earnings ratio.
Ashfield argues that the ratio tends to average about 100, ie the two yields
tend to be about the same level. At the moment, the ratio is 82 per cent
(ie, the earnings yield is less than the return on irredeemables), a sign
that shares are expensive. But the ratio is not as low as it was at the peak
of the market in 1987, or in 1972.

FT  21 AUG 93 / Markets: Suddenly, the yen heads for the heights - London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THE RISE in the equity market this week has had stock market commentators
rushing to change their forecasts for the year-end. While many were
predicting that the Footsie would reach 3,100 by then, they are now looking
at 3,200 by next weekend.
The rise in the index this week, of 47.5 points to a close of 3057.6, was
concentrated entirely in a 48.6 point jump on Wednesday, the largest one-day
increase since January 26.
It is easy to see the gain as driven by the good news that the market has
been using to justify rising thus far: falling interest rates; the prospect
of another base rate cut this autumn; and low inflation which should
continue for some time, combining to drive down gilt yields and push
equities higher.
That is backed by the economic recovery which is becoming more evident with
each week's crop of economic statistics - such as higher retail sales; a
lower public sector borrowing requirement than expected in July; strong
growth in borrowing; and a rise in corporate profit margins as wage growth
lags profit growth. But market strategists have begun to latch on to a
significant new element.
While people have been pre-occupied by the break-up of the exchange rate
mechanism and what that means for the UK, the yen has been rising. It almost
broke through the Y100-Dollars 1 level this week, but turned back abruptly
after heavy intervention from the US authorities. The Japanese, anxious to
reflate their economy, want the yen to come down from this peak. Thus, there
is now strong pressure inside and outside the country to reverse the
currency's rise.
Nick Knight, equity strategist at the Japanese-owned Nomura Research
Institute - who should know - says that, within Japan, the large
institutional investors will be encouraged to sell the yen and shift their
money overseas.
Which important currency has been one of the worst performers against the
yen and might, therefore, be the first to which Japanese investors turn
their attention? Sterling. The beginning of the yen's latest surge coincided
with sterling's devaluation last September, and the yen has risen from
Y245-Pounds 1 to Y150.
Which large and liquid stock market is on the rise anticipating, yet not
fully discounting, economic recovery? The UK.
Put the two together and Knight's theory of a Japanese 'wall of money'
buying the UK stock market is not so fanciful. He has long predicted the
Footsie would rise to 3,500 by the end of this year, and is looking for a
smaller increase - to 3,700 - by the end of 1994. If you miss this move in
the market, you might as well forget UK equities for the next five years, he
says.
Buying from overseas investors was much in evidence this week in heavy
turnover, and retail investors have been buying, too. Fears earlier this
year that hefty gilt sales, rights issues and flotations would put too much
of a strain on cash flows, and keep the market down, have proved groundless.
Even the generally more cautious Michael Hughes, at BZW, is pointing to the
yen story. He notes that someone could borrow in yen, switch the money into
sterling and buy UK equities yielding enough to cover the yen interest cost,
giving a free play on the currency and the UK market.
Like nature abhorring a vacuum, markets abhor this kind of discrepancy. And
stock markets (to quote Knight again) do move in straight lines every so
often.
Once it becomes obvious to all that a market should be higher, it will move
there fast. In January 1989, for instance, the Footsie rose 250 points with
barely a down day. It went on to gain nearly 300 more points by the
year-end.
Since July 21 this year, when the Footsie hit its recent low of 2814.1, the
index has risen 243.5 points, again with hardly a pause. Any market that
rises that far that fast might need a couple of days' consolidation, though,
as it did on Thursday and Friday this week.
Hughes can find another reason why the equity market is undervalued. He
draws a parallel with the 1930s, a period when companies reduced the
proportion of earnings paid out in dividends, preferring to retain profits
internally as the economy recovered.
This is happening again now, so the market can rise without dividends
increasing as fast as earnings - meaning yields on equities can go lower. A
3.5 per cent yield implies the Footsie at around 3,250. The market is not
expensive at present levels, he says.
So, what of the concern from some companies this week about the fragility of
the economic recovery in the UK and Europe? Argos, the catalogue retailer,
which reported a 39 per cent profit rise to Pounds 13.2m pre-tax for its
first half on Monday, warned that a tough budget could kill the 'fragile
recovery.'
First, the recovery might be more fragile in retailing than elsewhere, given
the competitive state of that sector. Then, the hints about November's
Budget indicate it will not be such a tax-raising exercise as first thought.
The better news on the PSBR helps. The National Institute of Economic and
Social Research predicted taxes would rise by Pounds 2.5bn in the Budget -
but with interest rate cuts, too, that would be neutral for demand.
The other fear is that the continued recession in continental Europe will
hold back UK profits. BICC, the cables company, made this point on Tuesday
when recording a 12 per cent fall in interim pre-tax profits to Pounds 51m.
The figures were depressed by a reduction in profits from its European
business. Similarly, a fall in exports to Europe was blamed for the first
drop in UK car production for 18 months.
But that is yesterday's story. The collapse of the ERM - which has so far
happened in theory, but should happen in practice after the summer holidays
 -will sort that out.

FT  21 AUG 93 / The Long View: Money on big dipper
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MONEY IN Britain may soon begin to shrink in volume, normally a sign of
economic depression. Should we (a) panic, (b) ignore the trend as irrelevant
and distorted or (c) try somehow to massage the figures back into the
government's target growth zone (now downgraded anyway into a weaselly
'monitoring range')?
The clearing banks' half-year results season earlier this month featured a
bounce-back in their profits as the bad debt problems eased, but also
suggested underlying margin pressures as borrowers have become scarce. Net
new sterling lending was no more than about Pounds 8.5bn during the first
half of the year, and since some Pounds 4.5bn of that was by building
societies the pickings for the clearing banks were thin indeed.
These are topsy-turvy times. The Germans have been struggling to hold down
the growth of broad money, which hit an annualised rate of 7.1 per cent for
June; that was above the top of the Bundesbank's 4 1/2 -6 1/2 per cent
target range. Yet monetary growth in the UK dipped to 3.3 per cent
year-on-year, perilously close to the bottom of the Treasury's 3-9 per cent
band.
There is, however, money and money. The real sluggishness relates to the
broadly-defined stuff, which includes a vast amount of savings deposits:
private individuals, for instance, have about Pounds 250bn in
interest-paying accounts in banks and building societies. But the volume of
cash which actually directly lubricates day-to-day economic activity has
begun to pick up, and seems to be growing at about 5 per cent a year.
They have a long, technical word for the broad money problem:
disintermediation. It happens when finance through banks is replaced by
investment directly by the public. A perfect example will be the proposed
flotation (minus Harrods) of the House of Fraser department stores chain,
snatched by the Fayed brothers from under the nose of Lonrho's Tiny Rowland
some 10 years ago.
According to the apoplectic Rowland, the Sultan of Brunei's wealth was
temporarily tapped to finance the deal, but the long-term finance came from
Swiss, German, British and Japanese banks which put up capital for a private
business in a classic 1980s debt financing exercise. But in this and many
other cases the banks found that the lending proved riskier than they had
expected. Thus in the past few years the takeover game has seriously slowed:
spare a thought for the poor old City Takeover Panel, which complained in
its annual report last month that it dealt with only 88 takeover proposals
in 1992-93 against an annual average of 225: like the clearing banks the
panel is having to reduce its staff.
Next year House of Fraser is to be floated back on to the stock market from
whence it came. Investors will raid their deposit accounts to pay for the
shares, and some of the Fayeds' bank loans will be paid off. If M4 shrinks
for this kind of reason, it is hard to see that there will be any adverse
economic consequences. Indeed, there are reasons to believe that public
companies will be run better than private businesses collapsing under the
weight of indebtedness.
Certainly, bank loan demand from the corporate sector is seriously weak.
Industrial and commercial companies repaid bank loans in the first quarter
of the year to the extent of over Pounds 5bn. This reflected their return to
financial balance at the end of the recession, and their ability to tap the
securities markets. Equity issues, for instance, raised more than Pounds 8bn
in the first half-year.
In this respect the UK is following the trend established last year in the
US, and continued with a vengeance so far in 1993. Corporate bond issues
there are heading for over Dollars 800bn this year, and equity underwritings
are running ahead of last year's record Dollars 102bn. After the leveraging
of corporate America during the late 1980s, when company equity was being
bought back from the public at up to Dollars 125bn a year, net equity
issuance is running at about Dollars 70bn annually. This sidelining of the
banking system has led to a stagnation in the US money supply, with M2 up 1
per cent over the past year (a small drop in real terms). Alan Greenspan,
chairman of the US Federal Reserve, has dismissed M2 as a distorted measure,
and prefers to chase even more shadowy concepts, such as real interest
rates.
Does a falling money supply matter, in these circumstances? You can either
argue that the weakness of the US monetary aggregates has not prevented an
economic recovery, or that it is the explanation for the weakness of the
upswing. At least the US is making good progress in cutting private sector
indebtedness. In the UK the overhang of record levels of personal debt
remains a problem which has hardly been tackled. Indeed, mortgage lending
continues to show modest growth.
Here is the puzzle, that while the Germans struggle to control monetary
growth through high interest rates, low US rates have coincided with
exceptional monetary weakness. The answer lies in time lags. The short-term
consequence of high interest rates is a rise in deposits, until the economy
slumps and loan demand collapses. The short-term consequence of low interest
rates is a flight of savings from banks, and thus a monetary contraction,
until eventually the economy expands vigorously under the influence of cheap
money and the borrowers return in numbers. That will be a tricky period
indeed for the Federal Reserve, and the prospect is viewed with apprehension
by Wall Street.
In these big dipper circumstances the monetarists prescribe that the
monetary aggregates should be persuaded to grow steadily and smoothly. It
might have to be done by financing the public sector deficit through the
banks. But if the British banks grew too fat on excessive private sector
indebtedness in the 1980s should they not now be allowed to grow thin? My
preference is for (b) but I dare say that in due course the government will
try (c) before resorting to (a).

FT  21 AUG 93 / Russia's women face a new reign of fear: When communism
fell, women looked forward to the benefits of democracy. But, they are now
in danger of losing a fundamental right: safe, legal abortion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
STRANGE THINGS are happening in post-communist Europe. When democracy
supplanted communism as the dominant political system in eastern Europe, its
oppressed peoples expected to inherit greater rights and freedoms. However,
for women, democracy has turned out to be a painful disappointment.
Just four years after democratic revolutions transformed the cartography of
the Soviet bloc, women are in danger of losing one of the fundamental rights
they were guaranteed under communism - the right to a safe, legal abortion.
In Poland, which now ranks alongside Ireland in having Europe's most
restrictive abortion laws, abortion is allowed only in cases of rape and
incest; when the mother's health is endangered; or when tests reveal serious
foetal defects.
In Hungary, women must go before a committee before they can seek an
abortion, and women in the former East Germany must go through official
counselling.
Now the Russian parliament is considering a new law which women say is a
first step toward restricting, and eventually banning, abortion in Russia.
The controversial bill contains a clause which says that the state
'recognises' a child's 'right to life' - the most contentious aspect of the
legislation - and a provision which calls for granting men and women 'equal
rights in deciding all issues of family life, including issues of family
planning.'
While supporters of the bill insist that the latter provision is meant to
enhance the rights of fathers in custody suits, which are largely ignored in
Russia, women's rights advocates fear it could mean that a woman would have
to obtain permission from her partner before seeking an abortion.
'If this bill is passed, the freedom of choice a woman has today will be
destroyed', says Ludmila Zavadskaya, a lawyer and MP who is an outspoken
critic of the proposed legislation. 'A situation could arise where a woman
comes in for an abortion and the doctor says to her: 'Let me see the
decision of your husband'.
'I was at a conference recently and I met a lot of Polish women who are just
horrified. Now it looks like we may be going in the same direction.
Democracy isn't turning out the way it was supposed to at all.'
The Women's Union of Russia, a non-governmental organisation with more than
2m members, recently protested to parliament about the bill. 'We consider it
necessary', the women wrote, 'to preserve the present norm whereby the final
decision is left to the woman . . . a woman cannot be forced into motherhood
against her will.'
'The new catch-phrase is: 'Let's return women to their natural destiny','
says Marina Baskakova, a scholar at the Gender Center in Moscow, which
researches women's issues. 'But we are not in the 17th century. A woman
should have the right to choose how many children she wants to have.' In her
view, the proposed law would reduce women to 'biological instruments for
continuing the human race.'
Another provision that has ignited controversy - it also appears in
President Boris Yeltsin's version of Russia's new constitution - states that
the government has the right to carry out a 'progressive demographic
policy', a well-known euphemism, women say, for reintroducing a ban on
abortion.
Such a law, they maintain, would be a throwback to the pro-natalist policies
of Stalinism when motherhood was considered an obligation to the state and
women could be jailed for terminating a pregnancy.
In the view of Elena Yershova, a liberal MP: 'It is terrible that women in
our country have to have so many abortions in conditions that are far from
ideal. But it's better than having to have an illegal abortion. We already
went through that.
'My mother lived her whole life during the time when abortions were illegal.
They were also conducting a 'progressive demographic policy'.'
The consequences of such a policy have been well-documented. In 1966, after
the government of Romania reversed its liberal abortion policy in an attempt
to create more workers for the state, the number of live births nearly
doubled. But after just two years the rate started to decline and death from
illegal abortions soared.
Opponents of the Russian bill say that it is part of a broad post-communist
backlash against women's rights.
In a telephone interview from Brussels, Anita Pollack, a British member of
the Committee on Women's Rights of the European Parliament, which had
appealed to the Polish Parliament not to approve its anti-abortion bill,
called the Russian bill 'appalling' and 'an infringement on women's rights.'
'One tyranny is being replaced by another', she added. 'Here in the west, we
are trying to advance a woman's right to do what she wants with her body.
This was always something very positive in the east . . . Now, it's just
going backwards for them.'
Indeed, the proposed Russian legislation seems part of a campaign to promote
traditional gender roles. Instead of allocating resources to re-train women,
who account for 70 per cent of Russia's unemployed, the bill proposes that
unemployed pregnant women would stay at home and receive half the monthly
minimum wage of Dollars 7.74. A monthly salary of Dollars 18 is considered
poverty level. Such a development would only create a poor female
underclass, women say.
It seems paradoxical, at first, that a backlash against women's rights could
occur in newly-democratic nations in the throes of revolutionary political
and economic change. But there are various factors at work.
One reason is that a new heterogeneity has permeated societies that were
formerly one-party states. 'Before, we were a monolithic society', says
Elena Yershova. 'Now we have everything - leftist extremists, right-wingers,
centrists and even religious fundamentalists who support a ban on abortion.'
Greater religious freedom has played a central role in the permutation of
abortion policy in eastern Europe. The church, once consigned to the fusty
antechamber of backroom politics, is using its new-found moral mandate to
push through its own social plans.
Abortion is increasingly being re-examined as a moral issue - something that
never happened under atheism. And the law, which once reflected communist
principles, now often supports the position of the church.
After the communists were ousted from Poland in 1989, banning abortion
became a primary goal of the country's bishops. The resulting legislation
was directly sponsored by the church; many legislators who voted in favour
of the law admitted they had done so as a concession to Pope John Paul II.
In Hungary the powerful anti-abortion crusade which led to the new law in
that country was also spearheaded by the Roman Catholic Church.
However, in Russia atheism is still entrenched. Unlike Poland, where 95 per
cent of the population is Roman Catholic, the church in Russia has not, so
far, emerged as a major political force.
Here, the factor behind the conservative backlash appears to be nationalism.
As in Hungary, the number of births in Russia has not kept pace with the
rising number of deaths. As a result, the abortion debate has centred on
nationalist fears about declining population.
In the first six months of 1993 there were 120,000 fewer births than in the
same period last year, and 178,000 more deaths, the Russian newspaper
Moskovskaya Pravda reported on its front page recently. Although
demographers say it is normal for a country's birth rate to fall during big
social upheavals, such as industrialisation, or, in this case, a shift to a
market-oriented economy, Russian nationalists often speak of the declining
birth rate in apocalyptic tones. Ultra-nationalist vice-president Alexander
Rutskoi told a stunned audience of women at a conference that it was up to
them to 'save the motherland' by having more babies. (It was supposed to be
a business conference).
The abortion debate is also a manifestation of what Andrei Popov, a medical
researcher who has studied abortion in Russia for 13 years, calls the
'post-communist syndrome' - an eagerness to undo former policies: a
knee-jerk reaction which Popov compares with the frenzied toppling of
socialist realist statues of communist heroes that began two years ago.
'If abortions were allowed under the communists, it means abortions must be
bad because the communists are bad', Popov explains. 'There is a tendency to
want to stamp out what we had yesterday and turn everything on its head.'
But Popov and others insist that banning, or even restricting, abortion
would have graver consequences for women in Russia than elsewhere because it
has been virtually the sole means of regulating fertility for much longer.
'In eastern Europe, their abortion history didn't start until after the
second world war', says Popov; in Russia, abortion was first legalised under
Lenin in 1920.
However, since no contraception was available, by the mid-1920s there was a
shortage of beds in state-run abortion clinics, and fee-charging
'commercial' clinics opened to meet demand. By the 1960s, says Popov, a
formidable abortion lobby had emerged.
Inside the upper echelons of the ministry of health, a powerful cadre of
doctors, who earned handsome fees for providing 'extra' services such as
anaesthesia during abortions, 'blocked the production and development of the
contraceptive industry to protect their own interests.'
In a propaganda campaign designed to discredit birth control pills, the
doctors warned that they could cause cancer and even madness. In true
centralised fashion, a report detailing all the so-called side effects of
oral contraceptives was distributed to all doctors, hospitals, and clinics
across the Soviet Union. As a result, abortion became the only means of
regulating fertility that was trusted.
'Everyone was sure that abortion was the best method and this attitude
persists today, especially among older doctors', says Popov. In 1991,
3,442,395 legal abortions were performed in Russia, almost 2m more than the
number of babies born in the same period.
Family planning programmes are just beginning to emerge, and while IUDs and
condoms are available, they are often expensive and of sub-standard quality.
Result: most people are poorly informed about them.
Anita Pollack says she hopes that the controversy over the bill might have
at least one positive effect - to help bring women together. 'There's a
whole different aspect to democracy which is ill-understood in these
countries, which is that all this freedom is very well but you have to get
together and fight for your rights. It's a painful and difficult thing to
do, and is perhaps something that's new, but it's part of the democratic
process.'
Russian women say they will put up a vociferous legislative fight. But even
if the bill is quashed, concern among those who favour abortion will not
disappear.
Ironically, if Boris Yeltsin's version of the constitution - which is
generally liberal, apart from the 'progressive demographic policy' clause -
is adopted, Russia's democratisation process could spell a setback to
women's rights.

FT  21 AUG 93 / FO offers diplomatic plodders a path to the top

<TEXT>
DIPLOMATIC plodders may finally get the grand embassies and knighthoods
which have tended to be the exclusive preserve of public school and
Oxbridge-educated high flyers.
The Foreign Office - the most traditional of Whitehall departments - is
planning an assault on the Victorian class divisions that permeate the
entire civil service.
The institution that inspired countless Carlton-Brownes has decided 'in
principle' to abolish its fast stream, which is enshrined in the elitism of
the Diplomatic Service.
This could be one of the most egalitarian reforms since 1854, when patronage
was replaced by competitive exams 'for the supply of the public service with
a thoroughly efficient class of men'.
In the mid-nineteenth century, Lord Clarendon only selected candidates known
to him personally.
The Foreign Office's decision will eventually end the segregation between
'officers' and 'other ranks' and could help its drive to broaden its intake
beyond Oxbridge and the public schools.
In the fast-stream system, high flyers expected to sail effortlessly to the
levels of senior ambassador or deputy under-secretary are handpicked by the
Civil Service Commission and enter the service at Grade 8 or 7d.
Fewer than 1 per cent of those who apply to be fast streamers by ticking a
box on the application forms are chosen, having survived country-house
weekends during which table manners and choice of newspaper are noted as
keenly as grasp of foreign affairs.
Progress up the ladder to a prestigious embassy posting then becomes almost
automatic.
Fast-stream officers can expect a posting abroad soon after entering the
service, and a succession of interesting economic, commercial, and political
jobs both at home and in the field.
Sir John Weston, tipped become the next head of the Diplomatic Service, is a
good example. Head boy at Sherborne, a First at Oxford, top of his year in
the civil service entrance exams, he has risen to become the UK permanent
representative to Nato in Brussels after postings in Paris and Washington.
A diplomatic plodder would have entered the executive class at Grade 9
before gaining a consular job. Slow-streamers do not expect to progress
beyond Grade 5, the first secretary level that high flyers reach in their
early thirties.
Though fast and slow stream officers are already within the same
administrative group, only a couple of officers a year manage to 'bridge'
into the fast stream by passing through the final selection board. Clerical
staff enter at Grade 10 and rarely leave registry - the secretarial office
of a department.
The Foreign Office would not confirm its decision. But one ex-civil servant
said he did not think the change would herald a more egalitarian era.
'The Foreign Office is like a concertina,' he said. 'It may go in and out
but it will always make the same noise.'

FT  21 AUG 93 / GEC Althsom chosen for Seoul rail project: Anglo-French
group in Pounds 1.6bn high-speed train deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BURTON, JOHN RIDDING and DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SEOUL, PARIS, FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A LONG-RUNNING battle for one of the world's biggest high-speed train
projects was decided yesterday when the South Korean government chose GEC
Alsthom, the Anglo-French joint venture, to supply rolling stock and
technology for its planned high-speed line.
GEC Alsthom's Train a Grande Vitesse (TGV) was selected ahead of Germany's
Inter-City Express (ICE) and Japan's Shinkansen. The contract for the 400km
line between Seoul and the southern port of Pusan is worth about Dollars
2.4bn (Pounds 1.61bn).
Negotiations on the details of the contract will now begin. GEC Alsthom said
it expected the contract would be signed by the end of the year. The TGV was
selected after six rounds of bids that began two years ago.
Mr Lee Ke-ik, the transport minister, said the TGV was chosen because of its
lower purchase and operating cost, although the ICE offered more advanced
technology.
GEC Alsthom's final Dollars 2.4bn bid was 40 per cent lower than its initial
offer. Part of the reduction reflected the depreciation of the French franc
against the US dollar during the past 18 months.
Siemens said yesterday it regretted the South Korean government's decision
but added it would remain committed to South Korea and hoped to win
sub-contracting work on the project.
The power and capacity of the TGV will be increased for South Korea. The
Korean trains will each be able to carry 1,038 passengers, more than double
the number on the Paris-Lyon line. Construction began last year on the
Korean link, which is due to be opened in 2002.
GEC Alsthom will supply a total of 46 trains - six carriages plus engines -
with deliveries to be completed by 2001. They include 14 trains that will
start operating in 1999 on the first segment of track between Seoul and
Taejon in central Korea.
Mr Pierre Bilger, chief executive of GEC Alsthom, said that half of the
equipment for the South Korean trains and systems would be built locally and
that Korean partners would receive all the technology necessary for the
project.
It is the first Asian train order for GEC Alsthom, which has already been
selected to provide high-speed trains for the channel tunnel and Spain.
A Korean high-speed train, first mooted in the late 1970s, is meant to help
solve transport bottlenecks as the country's motorways become clogged with
traffic. Traffic congestion is estimated to cost the country Dollars 6bn in
lost output each year.

FT  21 AUG 93 / Cadbury strengthens its role in US soft drinks market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CADBURY Schweppes yesterday moved to strengthen its position in the US soft
drinks market with the Dollars 231.3m (Pounds 154.2m) acquisition of a
further 20.2 per cent stake in the Dr Pepper/Seven-Up group.
The purchase of shares from The Prudential Insurance Company of America
brings Cadbury's shareholding in the US soft drinks company to 25.9 per
cent.
Cadbury made it clear that the investment was a prelude to closer trading
links with Dr Pepper that would enable the two companies to compete more
effectively against Coca-Cola and PepsiCo in the Dollars 47bn market.
Mr Dominic Cadbury, Cadbury Schweppes chairman, denied that the shares had
been bought as part of a takeover plan but added: 'I would not rule out a
further step in the future but equally we have no plans for that.'
Discussions will continue with Dr Pepper on areas for future co-operation.
Some City analysts believe Cadbury's drinks brands, which include Schweppes,
Canada Dry, and Sunkist, may be injected into the Dr Pepper operation,
giving it a US market share of between 14 per cent and 15 per cent.
Dr Pepper already produces the bulk of Cadbury Schweppes' soft drinks
concentrates in the US.
Cadbury also sees opportunities for developing sales of Dr Pepper's brands
alongside its own soft drinks in other markets.
Acquisition of the Prudential shares will be funded from Cadbury's cash
resources and existing borrowing arrangements. The price is equivalent to
Dollars 19 a share, a 9.4 per cent premium to Thursday's market price of
Dollars 17.375.
The acquisition is expected to dilute Cadbury's earnings in the first year
by up to 2 per cent.
Dr Pepper/Seven-Up is the third largest drinks company in the US with a
market share of 10.6 per cent. It has been growing quickly, increasing sales
last year by 7 per cent. The group reported a net loss, after extraordinary
charges, last year of Dollars 8m on sales of Dollars 658.7m but its
performance improved this year.
Cadbury Schweppes, the world's third largest soft drinks business, had a 3.4
per cent share of the US market last year.

FT  21 AUG 93 / The Lex Column: UK fund management
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Fund management groups should always outperform a rising equity market. With
fees paid by institutions linked to the value of funds under management -
and a high level of fixed costs - their earnings are geared to rising
markets. It should come as no surprise, then, that Henderson Administration,
Mercury Asset Management and M&amp;G have outperformed the market by 50 per cent
since sterling left the ERM last September.
With interest rates so low, the prospect of heavy unit trust sales as
private investors shift savings out of deposit accounts has added spice to
the cyclical recovery. Aggregate sales figures certainly support the notion
that unit trusts are attracting retail money. The question is which of the
fund managers will capture that business. M&amp;G's half year sales figures were
mildly disappointing given its reputation. Perpetual, one of the minnows of
the sector, has seen its market capitalisation increase fivefold over the
last year thanks to its success in this area.
The danger is that fund managers' gearing to the equity market also cuts
both ways. The market capitalisation of Henderson fell by 70 per cent in the
aftermath of the 1987 stock market crash. Private investors will not keep
blind faith in unit trusts should the stock market suffer a serious setback.
One can only hope that the very low yield on cash deposits means that the
flow of retail money into equities is less speculative than six years ago.

FT  21 AUG 93 / The Lex Column: Cellular telecoms
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
AT&amp;T's purchase of McCaw for Dollars 12.6bn has put a very fancy price tag
on cellular phone companies. AT&amp;T doubtless has its strategic objectives -
having been shut out of local telephony in 1984, presumably it hopes that
McCaw will provide a backdoor route back into the market. Radio is also a
useful weapon for a phone company as technology widens the options for
information transfer. Yet AT&amp;T has paid a very high price for what is only
one plank in its strategic platform. The acquisition values McCaw's cellular
customers at Dollars 270 each.
By comparison, UK cellular phone companies are cheap. Vodafone's customers
are only valued by the market at around Dollars 120 apiece. What's more,
Vodafone and Cellnet are profitable, while McCaw has never made money, after
its heavy interest payments. It is possible to cut the valuation gap between
the two companies by cutting off the bid premium AT&amp;T has paid, discounting
for spin off benefits AT&amp;T may reap and adjusting for the higher income of
US subscribers.
Even when that is done, however, Vodafone still looks cheap. Unfortunately
for its shareholders it may remain so unless anyone is prepared to bid. AT&amp;T
is probably the only company prepared to pay anything like Dollars 12bn for
McCaw and, having done so, is most unlikely to bid for Vodafone. Apart from
anything else, the goodwill write off would be prohibitive. Nor is BT likely
to follow AT&amp;T's lead by mopping up Securicor's 40 per cent stake in
Cellnet. BT can already exercise all the management control it needs, though
why it has not done more to improve Cellnet's performance remains a mystery.

FT  21 AUG 93 / The Lex Column: Cadbury Schweppes
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Cadbury Schweppes' acquisition of a further 20 per cent of the Dr
Pepper/Seven-Up group for Dollars 231m (Pounds 154m) could inject a lot more
fizz into the UK company's growth prospects. The investment will only make
sense if it leads to closer operating links or outright acquisition. Either
outcome would greatly enhance Cadbury's position in the US market. This
would be useful considering Americans guzzle 34 per cent of the world's soft
drinks.
At present, Cadbury controls 3 per cent of the US market. The addition of Dr
Pepper's share would give it 14 per cent. This is still way behind Coca Cola
and Pepsico, and it is worth recalling Cadbury's unhappy experience of
filling the weak number three slot in the US chocolate market. But Cadbury
and Dr Pepper would command 40 per cent of the faster growing non-cola
drinks sector. That would make their market position far more defensible.
In the absence of a bid, the worry is that Cadbury's existing trading
relationship with Dr Pepper could turn flat, since the suspicion is that Dr
Pepper is not ecstatic about Cadbury's latest purchase. It is unclear
whether the two sides will be able to reach amicable agreements about
trading co-operation and board representation. Cadbury could contemplate
launching a full bid for Dr Pepper even though it would have to turn to
shareholders for fresh funds. Since 1986, Cadbury has shrewdly spent Pounds
1bn on safe, relatively small, non-dilutive acquisitions. Spending the same
sum again at one throw would certainly shift the risk profile for Cadbury.

FT  21 AUG 93 / The Lex Column: Equities cash in
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The rallying cry of every market top is 'this time things are different'. It
was being shouted once more this week as investors scratched around for
props to justify market valuations which have not been seen for a
generation. With cash returns miserly and gilts yields plummeting, a grab
for yield is the central pillar of the argument. The gilt/equity yield ratio
is hardly stretched, and with some utility shares offering income higher
than building society deposits, any capital gain is viewed as a bonus.
Low inflation is essential to maintain this argument, since it makes real
yields on gilts appear attractive. Thus far there is little sign of renewed
price pressures, and with commodity prices weak, unit wage costs low,
monetary growth sluggish and a large output gap, inflation may not pick up
for some time. Whether the UK has moved into an era of low inflation and
things really are different is a more open question. Signs that price
pressures are building up would quickly undermine the current enthusiasm.
One thing which appears not to be different this time is the extent to which
recovery is dependent on consumer demand. Personal balance sheets seem not
to be badly stretched and the savings ratio may fall as consumer confidence
grows. That should also help the kind of consumer stocks which have recently
looked attractive for their solid dividend yield. However, that final
support for equities - rumour of the Japanese wall of money - will surely
have those who remember 1987 reaching for their sell notes.

FT  21 AUG 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Program buying lifts
blue-chip stocks
</HEADLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
AFTER TRADING most of the day in negative territory, a burst of late program
buying allowed blue-chip stocks to end at new highs yesterday, writes
Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 3.35 at 3,615.48. The
more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 ended down 0.44 at 455.99, while
the Amex composite finished up 0.74 at 448.70, and the Nasdaq composite up
0.47 at 730.95. Trading volume on the NYSE was 277m.
After three consecutive days of record-breaking gains, the Dow took a
breather, opening lower across the board in light trading. Dealers
attributed the early declines to profit-taking, and to selling related to
the monthly expiration of stock index options.
Sentiment was also undermined by the behaviour of the bond market. Treasury
prices, which rose steadily all week, pushing yields to new historic lows in
the process, reversed course yesterday. However, stocks rebounded late in
the day as more options-related trading, this time program buying, helped
the market end on a firm note. Stocks that had been in demand mid-week ran
into profit-taking - Philip Morris fell Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 50 1/4 ,
Coca-Cola slipped Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 43 1/2 , Pepsico fell Dollars 1 to
Dollars 39 1/8 , and American Brands dropped Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 32 5/8
.
Selected pharmaceutical stocks suffered a similar fate, but other were in
strong demand. Bristol-Myers Squibb fell Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 56 3/8 ,
and Merck eased Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 32 3/4 , while Pfizer added Dollars
1 at Dollars 64 1/8 and Johnson &amp; Johnson firmed Dollars 5/8 to Dollars 41.
General Electric rose Dollars 2 to Dollars 98 5/8 in volume of 1.5m shares
after confirming that it will shed more than 4,000 jobs.
Fisher-Price soared Dollars 9 3/8 to Dollars 33 in reaction to Thursday's
late announcement that it is being taken over by Mattel in a Dollars 1.1bn
stock swap. The news left Mattel up Dollars 1 1/2 at Dollars 27 1/8 .
Hasbro, which now has a rival of comparable size in the toy industry, fell
Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 36 5/8 .
Dr Pepper/Seven-Up jumped Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 19 after Cadbury
Schweppes, the UK confectionery and soft drinks group, bought Prudential
Insurance's stake for Dollars 231.3m, upping its stake in the US soft-drinks
group from 5.7 per cent to 25.9 per cent. Cadbury ADRs, traded on the Nasdaq
market, fell Dollars 1/4 to Dollars 29 3/4.
Elsewhere on the Nasdaq, leading technology stocks were mostly firmer.
Borland International rose Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 19, Microsoft added
Dollars 2 at Dollars 76 1/4, Dell Computer firmed Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 19
1/2 and Apple Computer rose Dollars 1/2 to Dollars 28.
Canada
TORONTO posted a small gain in moderate trading. According to preliminary
data, the TSE-300 index gained 7.59 points to 4,077.18, up 63 points on the
week. Advances led declines 409 to 328, trading volume was 52.444m shares
and trading value was CDollars 523.6m.

FT  21 AUG 93 / World Stock Markets: Arguments range over Swiss share
prospects - The high-performance Zurich bourse
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The all-share Swiss Performance Index (SPI) climbed to new record heights in
heavy volume this week. While it eased over the last two days to 1,566.51 by
yesterday's close, it still finished 0.6 per cent up on the week, bringing
its advance this year to an impressive 26.5 per cent.
Ironically, this latest show of strength came just after an influential
broker, London's James Capel, had launched what looked like the definitive
tract on why the great Swiss bull run, like all good things, was coming to
an end.
The Capel argument was that the Swiss market might still not be that
expensive, but it would now enter a phase in which it would not perform
relatively as well as others, especially the German market.
This was because the Swiss market was composed mainly of defensive and
interest rate-sensitive shares. Now that economic recovery was in prospect,
investors would turn increasingly to cyclical shares and thus to markets,
such as Germany, in which cyclicals were heavily represented.
Other Swiss market analysts accept the logic of the Capel argument. 'I agree
that it is not a good market for cyclicals,' says Mr Attela Molnar, head of
investment strategy at Swiss Bank Corporation.
Where opinions differ is on the timing and the extent of any reduction in
the weighting of Swiss equities. Some Swiss advisers, such as those at Swiss
Volksbank, for example, have already reduced their recommended weighting of
Swiss shares in European portfolios.
'In terms of valuation, the Swiss market is still attractive,' Mr Urs
Brunner, head of the bank's Swiss equity research team, says. 'But
Switzerland does not have the same potential on the interest rate side as
Germany and France.'
Mr Molnar says that SBC has dampened its recommendation from heavily
overweight last year to neutral.
Others are less sure that the time has come to switch, and they were
reinforced in their view by Thursday's announcement of flat profits by the
big transnational engineering group ABB Asea Brown Boveri.
Shares in Brown Boveri, the Swiss member of the Swedish-Swiss group, have
risen sharply in recent months in anticipation of economic recovery in
Europe, but they fell SFr18 on the news, and SFr11 more to SFr920 yesterday.
Some analysts say there could be more disappointments like that one in the
next few months. 'So many people have been afraid of missing the cyclicals
train that they have jumped on too soon,' Mr Beat Philipp, head of research
at Bank Vontobel in Zurich says. 'We think there is still too much fantasy
in the prices of some cyclicals.'
Mr Molnar adds that when the economic recovery in Europe does come, it will
probably be weak and slow to develop, just like that in the US.
Mr Philipp argues that the Swiss market will continue to perform well, even
relatively well, for some time to come, citing its still modest valuations
and supportive inflation and interest rate trends.
'In any European portfolio, we think investors would be well advised to have
Switzerland fully weighted,' he says.
He estimates that the market is valued at only 12 to 13 times prospective
1994 earnings, well below the level of the German market. Moreover, the
potential for further liquidity-driven gains may still be considerable, as
fixed-term bank deposits remain at about double the normal level for
Switzerland.
Mr Philipp and others agree that this liquidity does not have to flow into
Swiss equities, but they believe that much of it will, partly because Swiss
institutions are still in the process of increasing the weighting of
equities in their portfolios.
Also 'some people still want to have some of their investments in Swiss
francs, and it is no longer sensible to buy bonds,' said Mr Jean-Max Villar,
an analyst at Lombard Odier in Geneva.
Swiss analysts see the momentum in the market now being taken up again by
the traditional defensive stocks, Nestle, which has recovered smartly from a
weak spell in July, the big three pharmaceutical groups and especially the
big three banks.
They point out that the SMI index, which is dominated by these shares, has
advanced significantly less than the all-share SPI this year. And the bank
shares, in spite of big rises, are still on price-earnings ratios below that
of the market as a whole.
Sparkling interim reports from Union Bank of Switzerland and Credit Suisse
in the past week have made the bank share prices look even more modest, some
analysts say. Both reported pre-tax profit gains of over 50 per cent. As the
banks are still having to make very large provisions for bad loans, their
potential for further big profit gains in the next couple of years seems
strong.
For all its defensive nature, the Swiss market has its risks. The strong
downward trend of Swiss interest rates has been helped by turmoil in other
European currencies. Now that leading European currencies seem to face a
calmer period, the franc could lose some of its premium rating.

PROFIT-taking, caution and the occasional disappointment gave bourses an
uncomfortable afternoon in share price terms, writes Our Markets Staff.
PARIS rallied late in the session to close just above the key chart point of
2,123, the CAC-40 index losing 11.00 to 2,128.20, off nearly 1 per cent on
the week. Turnover was FFr2.9bn.
Alcatel Alsthom remained one of the most heavily traded stocks on news that
its joint venture with GEC of the UK had won the Dollars 2.4bn contract to
build a high-speed train network in South Korea. Investors chose this moment
to take profits after the shares had improved some 4 per cent over the week;
they closed down FFr2 at FFr732, but off the day's low of FFr722.
Mr Michael Woodcock of Nikko Europe in London commented that while this had
been an important contract to win, the joint venture had cut its initial bid
substantially to secure the deal, which would result in low margins.
Reports of a fall in the oil price in New York kept Elf Aquitaine and Total
subdued, the former losing FFr5.30 to FFr436.20 and the latter FFr7 to
FFr302.10.
FRANKFURT's official close was bracketed by late selling on the triple
expiry of DTB options contracts. The DAX index closed 16.30 lower at
1,922.68 on the session, still 0.8 per cent up on the week; but the
Ibis-indicated DAX sagged to 1,909.60 in the post-bourse.
Turnover fell from DM10.2bn to DM8bn. The market's big three, Deutsche Bank,
Daimler and Siemens, saw losses of DM4 to DM784, just 50 pfg to DM736 and
DM8.90 to DM682.60 extended later as they closed at DM777, DM728.50, and
DM674 in the London afternoon.
Siemens, down 2.5 per cent overall, was hit by the loss of the South Korean
railway order to GEC-Alsthom. Its subsidiary, AEG, lost DM6.70 to DM174.80
in sympathy during the official session, although it had picked up strongly
on a domestic train contract earlier in the week.
Viag continued to gain on the pending merger with Bayernwerk, rising DM12.50
to DM471; Mannesmann lost DM8 more to DM325.20 on Thursday's dismal results,
for a two day loss of 4.8 per cent; and MAN fell DM6 to DM331, slightly in
advance of poor German truck sales figures for July.
AMSTERDAM slipped back slightly on options expiry but brokers said that
sentiment remained positive. The CBS Tendency general index weakened 0.6 to
127.9, unchanged on the week.
The publishing sector continued to be firm with Elsevier putting on another
40 cents to Fl 144.40, a week's improvement of 10 per cent, and Wolters
Kluwer adding Fl 1.50 to Fl 97.50.
Nedlloyd fell Fl 3.90 to FL 42, but brokers put this down to technical
trading on the expiry of August options.
MILAN saw activity again concentrated broadly in the telecommunications
sector as the Comit index closed down 3.92 at 613.68, a gain of 4.2 per cent
on the week.
Sip and Stet both rose by L53, to L3,618 and L4,550 respectively.
Robert Fleming's Italian strategy team commented this week that the market's
rally over the last three months has been driven mainly by falls in bond
yields.
However, against a backdrop of falling European interest rates, the team
added, the expectation is for the index to stabilise around the 580-600
level. 'Indications of earnings recovery from industrial companies will not
come through unti the second quarter of 1994, which is when we expect the
market to start a second positive phase,' they said.
BRUSSELS ended with the Bel 20 index down 8.41 on the day, and 0.8 per cent
on the week at 1,346.69. Turnover was around BFr960m, excluding a BFr1.4bn
off-bourse trade in Banque Bruxelles Lambert reported to the stock exchange
before the opening.
The insurance company, Groupe AG, which sold the share block to its Swiss
counterpart, Winterthur, closed BFr30 lower at BFr2,620. BBL, which had
risen 4.5 per cent to BFr4,100 on Thursday, reacted to the deal with a loss
of BFr150 at BFr3,950.
STOCKHOLM saw profit-taking pull the market down, with the Affarsvarlden
general index off 16.7 at 1,309.5, a gain over the week of 1.2 per cent.
Turnover was down to SKr1.9bn from Thursday's SKr2.9bn.
Disappointing half year results from Investor also discouraged investors,
with the B shares dipping SKr7 to SKr144.
HELSINKI blamed profit-taking as the Hex index fell 25.70 to 1,464.20, still
1.6 per cent up on the week. In the banking sector, KOP fell FM1.3 to FM16
after Thursday's rights issue announcement.
VIENNA edged higher, while there were strong performances from Wienerberger,
the building materials group, gaining Sch45 to Sch3,585, and Creditanstalt,
up Sch4 to a new year's high of Sch737. The ATX index rose 1.30 to 1,000.36,
unchanged on the week.
ISTANBUL finished the week another 2.1 per cent higher on buying of some
underperforming blue chip stocks. For instance, Ergeli, the steel group,
added TL175 to TL1,925. The composite index ended 234 better at 11,149, an
improvement of 14.5 per cent on the week.

FT  21 AUG 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei down in fourth
consecutive session
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A SHARP fall both in the yen and bond prices triggered profit-taking, and
share prices lost ground for the fourth consecutive day, writes Emiko
Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei average fell 80.21 to 20,607.26, down 0.7 per cent on the week,
after a high of 20,859.49 in the morning and a low of 20,586.56 in the late
afternoon. Brokers were seen clearing positions ahead of the weekend, while
some foreign investors supported share prices.
Volume remained below 300m shares for the third day, at 230m against 253m.
Declines led advances by 501 to 442, with 206 unchanged. The Topix index of
all first section stocks fell 5.57 to 1,659.19 and, in London, the
ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 1.58 to 1,267.89.
The yen's decline against the dollar caused mixed reactions. Local
newspapers reported that overnight intervention by the US on the currency
markets, buying dollars against the yen, was the result of an agreement
between the US and Japan regarding an imminent cut in Japan's official
discount rate. Mr Jiro Saito, vice-minister of finance, later denied such an
accord.
Most investors turned pessimistic over an imminent easing of monetary
policy, with interest rate-sensitive banks and large-capital issues losing
ground. Industrial Bank of Japan fell Y50 to Y3,370 and Mitsubishi Bank lost
Y60 to Y2,870. Steels were also lower, with Nippon Steel down Y4 to Y376 and
Kawasaki Steel falling Y3 to Y365.
Ricoh, the office automation machinery maker, was once again the most active
issue of the day, rising Y16 to Y815.
High-technology issues were higher on the falling yen. Fujitsu rose Y14 to
Y780 and Sony gained Y110 to Y4,460.
In Osaka, the OSE average fell 21.20 to 22,534.63 in volume of 90.2m shares.
Roundup
THERE was some profit-taking among Pacific Rim markets yesterday.
HONG KONG fell back from its recent rally on profit-taking and
disappointment over Hang Seng Bank's interim profits which came after
Thursday's close. The Hang Seng index shed 59.90 to 7,545.36, up 2 per cent
on the week.
Hang Seng Bank fell HKDollars 3.50 to HKDollars 57.50 in turnover of
HKDollars 537m, while HSBC, the parent group, lost HKDollars 1.50 to
HKDollars 83.50.
Cheung Kong, which reported increased interim profits on Thursday, gained 40
cents to HKDollars 28.30 and its affiliate, Hutchison, 10 cents to HKDollars
23.00.
SINGAPORE soared on institutional buying, the Straits Times Industrial index
closing 23.49 higher at a record closing high of 1,972.27. The index has put
on 2.8 per cent over the week.
Property stocks were active with City Developments up 38 cents to SDollars
4.92.
NEW ZEALAND was a shade weaker as some investors chose to take profits. The
NZSE-40 capital index shed 0.66 to 2,018.52 for a gain on the week of 8.5
per cent. Turnover fell back to NZDollars 85m from Thursday's exceptional
NZDollars 142m.
MANILA was pulled higher by strength in Philippine Long Distance Telephone,
up 30 pesos to 1,165 pesos, which had seen gains in New York overnight
trading. The composite index put on 14.92 to 1,775.76, up 0.9 per cent on
the week.
BOMBAY closed higher in spite of some end-of-session profit-taking triggered
by disappointment over the dividend of the heavily-traded Reliance
Industries. The BSE index advanced 57.39 to 2,758.14 as Reliance fell Rp3 to
Rp272.
TAIWAN extended early losses to close lower across the board. The weighted
index lost 47.80 to 4,045.61 in turnover of TDollars 15.9bn, a week's loss
of 1.8 per cent.
JAKARTA's JKSE index ended another 3.09 higher at a new 1993 high of 387.91,
2.1 per cent higher on the week in moderate trade, reflecting positive
domestic sentiment.

FT  21 AUG 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The derivatives sector ended a hectic week on a more subdued note as dealers
paused to take profits and lock in gains made earlier in the week, writes
Joel Kibazo.
In futures, early trading in the September contract on the FT-SE 100 was
influenced by the initial weakness in gilts and, having opened at 3,069, the
contract drifted lower, falling to the day's low of 3,062 at around 9.30am.
Bargain-hunters returned the September contract to positive territory and it
rose to the day's high of 3,090 over the lunchtime period, before a dull
Wall Street led to another bout of consolidation.
It closed at 3,070, around 7 points above fair value premium on volume of
7,927 lots.
The expiry of the index options was meant to be the main event in the traded
options, though with much of the position closing having been done on
Wednesday and Thursday, it generated little in the way of turnover. Total
volume was 28,570 contracts, of which 6,323 was in the FT-SE 100 option and
3,846 in the Euro FT-SE 100 option.

FT  21 AUG 93 / London Stock Exchange: Lasmo alert
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Lasmo, the oil exploration and production group, staged a strong
revival yesterday as the market responded to recent talk that that a
predator may be stalking the company. The shares jumped 5 1/2 to 136 1/2 p
on heavy turnover of 11m shares.
Lasmo has been viewed as a potential bid target by market analysts following
its bitter experience in absorbing Ultramar, its fellow oil group. A
deterioration in Lasmo's performance following this acquisition was seen as
the trigger for the departure of Mr Chris Greentree, former chief executive,
earlier this year.
Lasmo shares began to stir earlier this week with rumours that British Gas -
following the MMC report which recommended that Gas lose its monopoly in the
UK gas supply business - might be interested in bidding for Lasmo. The Gas
bid stories have died down but the market was alive yesterday with talk that
a reshaping of the UK exploration and production sector may be in the
offing. Sector analysts were shocked recently by news that Mr John Walmsley,
Enterprise Oil's finance director, has resigned.
'It's all highly speculative at the moment, but the feeling is that
something might be afoot,' said one analyst.
Food retailers were one of the day's best performing sectors as speculation
that SG Warburg was about to create a covered warrant on the sector did the
rounds. No one at the securities house was available to comment but there
was good demand for several food retailing stocks.
The day's strong performers included Argyll Group - in which sentiment was
said to have also been boosted by a UBS recommendation - which gained 6 1/2
to 353 1/2 p, and Kwik Save, a strong performer earlier in the week
following broker's recommendations. The shares appreciated another 5 to
738p. J Sainsbury gained 6 to 522p, in trade of 2.4m.
Shares in Cadbury-Schweppes fell 8 to 493p, after it announced it was
increasing its stake in US drinks company Dr Pepper/Seven-UP to around 26
per cent, having picked up a 20.2 per cent stake for Dollars 231.3m. There
were fears in the market that Cadbury may decide to launch a full bid for Dr
Pepper and UK analysts doubt whether Cadbury should move into the
competitive mass US soft drinks market, a move they feel would necessitate a
cash raising effort.
Cadbury's purchase appeared to dash recent market speculation that it may
bid for United Biscuits. Shares in UB eased 10 to 381p, on the fading bid
hopes.
Shares in Allied-Lyons closed 7 ahead at 615p, after Smith New Court
reiterated its buy recommendation. The broker believes the stock to be cheap
on 'yield and PE considerations', and that the market has not yet given the
management credit for changes made. Guinness, in which Smith New Court
turned a buyer earlier this week, was in demand and the shares firmed 10 to
503p, on volume of 3.6m.

FT  21 AUG 93 / London Stock Exchange: Kleinwort trades
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two large share trades, early in the trading session, alerted the market to
the fact that a substantial stake in Kleinwort Benson, one of the City's
leading merchant banks and a big force in the UK securities market, had
changed hands.
The Seaq ticker revealed two major deals in the shares. The first, a block
of 7.8m traded for cash at 500p and the second a block of 7, at 498p.
It was later confirmed that American International Group (AIG), a leading US
insurance group, had sold its 6.6 per cent stake in Kleinwort Benson,
acquired in 1988. The deal was said to have been carried out by SG Warburg
Securities.
AIG's sale of its Kleinwort stake came the day after Kleinwort shares
climbed to their highest level since the October 1987 crash. The share price
edged up by one penny to 508p yesterday with trading volume of 15m shares.

FT  21 AUG 93 / London Stock Exchange: Block deal in RBOS
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A BUSY week in the banking sector was rounded off yesterday when a large
block of shares in Royal Bank of Scotland (RBOS) changed hands. The deal was
executed by Credit Lyonnais Laing, the French-owned stockbroker to Royal
Bank. CLL declined to comment on the deal.
An institution sold 20m shares at 286p. They were later placed in the market
at 287 1/2 p. The placing was said to have gone through very smoothly, with
institutions keen to take on the shares.
There were suggestions in the market that Banco Santander, the Spanish bank,
was the seller of the block of shares, around 2.5 per cent of RBOS, but this
was discounted by banking specialists who believed the stock had come from a
big UK institution, which was believed to have adopted the view that it was
overweight in the stock.
Santander was last shown as holding 9.89 per cent of RBOS while Scottish
Equitable Life held 5.24 per cent.
RBOS shares, marginally easier from the outset of the trading session, were
unmoved by the share sale, closing a net 4 off at 290p. Turnover,
representing double counting of the big institutional share sale, totalled
41m, the biggest single day's business in the stock since Big Bang in
October 1986.

FT  21 AUG 93 / London Stock Exchange: Profit-taking brings minor losses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER A brave start, the UK stock market yesterday followed the more subdued
tone evident in other global dealing centres to close slightly easier on the
day. Expiry day in London's FT-SE Index traded options and in New York's
futures and options markets brought some technical activity but the session
was generally one of consolidation.
In early dealings, the FT-SE Index moved up by 12.2 on the back of new peaks
on Wall Street overnight and continued optimism towards UK interest rate
prospects. The edge was taken off equities, however, by initial weakness in
government bonds and share prices began to give ground.
Losses in gilts ranged to more than  1/4 of a point at the longer end at
mid-session but the sector rallied as it digested reported comments on
interest rate policies by Mr Hans Tietmeyer, vice president of the
Bundesbank. By the close, long-dated UK bonds were only  1/4 down, although
index-linked gilts remained depressed by around of a point. There was little
immediate response, however, to disclosure that Britain's non-EC trade
deficit had widened sharply to Pounds 778m in July.
The Footsie dipped by 8 points in the lead-up to the expiry in the Index
Traded Option and the German stock market eased. Buyers then returned,
taking the Footsie to the day's best level of 3,077.7, still more than 11
points under the trading peak of the previous session.
Interest then waned and, with Wall Street also abandoning its recent peak to
shed 10 Dow points in UK hours, the London market fell steadily lower in
moderate trade.
At the close, the FT-SE Index was down 7.9 at 3,057.6. This week - the first
leg of a three-week equity trading account extended to cover the UK summer
bank holiday - has seen a gain of 47.5 points or around 1.6 per cent on the
Footsie. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index, down 3.6 at 3,482.4 yesterday, has gained
about 0.8 per cent over the week.
Seaq volume dipped to 633.4m shares as profit-taking was largely confined to
private investors and securities traders; around 54 per cent of the trade
came in non-Footsie stocks. Thursday's 837.2m shares through the Seaq
network generated Pounds 1.75bn in retail or customer business, sustaining
the increase in volume which has, in turn, encouraged a strong performance
from the merchant banking stocks.

FT  21 AUG 93 / Money Markets: Caution on sterling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DEALERS in the sterling interest rates market ended the week taking a rather
less optimistic view about a near-term cut in UK base rates than they had at
the start of it, writes James Blitz.
Last Monday, the December short sterling contract was still above the 94.75
level, pricing at least  3/4 of a percentage point off base rates by the end
of the year.
But several events brought the contract down to a close last night of 94.56,
a level which assumes that three-month money will be at 5.44 per cent by the
year's end.
The most important trigger for the downturn were bearish comments from Mr
Michael Portillo, the chief secretary to the Treasury, who said on Wednesday
that he did not want to lead people to think there would be a near-term
easing in monetary policy.
But sentiment about a rate cut has also been eroded by the speed of rate
cutting in Europe. This has been slower than was expected when the exchange
rate mechanism's currency fluctuation bands were widened. France has still
not reduced any of its main official interest rates.
However, some dealers think that the December contract is now fairly priced.
This week's retail sales figures showed a slight fall in July and
uncertainty remains about the pace of recovery in the UK. 'There are so many
sales on in the West End that I would be astonished if there were no cut in
rates by the end of the year,' said a dealer at a leading London house.
Three month sterling cash has sat doggedly at 5 7/8 per cent all week. But
the 6 and 12 month deposit rates have risen on the week, with the former
closing at 5 21/32 per cent last night and the latter nearly at 5 7/8 per
cent.
There was a shortage of Pounds 1.3bn in the discount market and late
assistance of Pounds 3.9m.
French franc futures have risen strongly this week amid two cuts in the
overnight rate by the Bank of France. The September French franc contract
closed up 11 basis points yesterday at 93.27 and the December contract was
up 3 at 93.31.
The effects of summer tax payments were finally making themselves felt on
German call money, which rose well above the Bundesbank's repo rate level of
6.80 per cent yesterday. Call money was quoted at 6.92 per cent yesterday,
having been well below the repo rate level earlier in the week.

FT  21 AUG 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Yen rebounds against dollar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE YEN performed strongly against the dollar in Friday's Asian and European
trading despite the dramatic intervention by the US Federal Reserve in
support of its currency the previous day, writes James Blitz.
The US authorities' intervention pushed the dollar to a high of Y106.70 at
about 8 o'clock on Thursday evening in London. But the yen drifted up again
afterwards, and, when Tokyo opened on Friday morning, profit taking had
pushed the Japanese currency to a Tokyo close of around Y104.30.
The yen also gained from comments made by Mr Hirohisa Fujii, the Japanese
trade minister, who said there was no bilateral agreement between his
country and the US to counter the fall in the dollar/yen exchange rate.
European traders tried and failed to push the currency below the 104 level
yesterday. But there was no further intervention from the US authorities
when New York opened, and, at the close in London, the yen was at Y104.85
from a previous Y104.15.
The lack of intervention could not be read as any change of view in the US
on the yen. Thursday had seen a classic demonstration of short-term currency
intervention, but the US authorities would have lacked the element of
surprise yesterday.
Mr David Cocker, chief economist at Chemical Bank, said that Monday's Tokyo
trading would decide where, and how fast, the yen goes next. 'Japanese
exporters will mull over events at the weekend,' he said. 'They will be
under pressure to sell dollars now in the belief that they may get fewer yen
for them if they wait.'
In Europe, the main focus was on comments by Mr Hans Tietmeyer, the
Bundesbank's President-elect, who said that a strong D-Mark could hamper
Germany's exporters.
Dealers have long been of the view that Mr Tietmeyer would take a softer
approach to the need for a strong D-Mark than the current president, Mr
Helmut Schlesinger. The comments led to a softening of the German currency
across the board, although dealers may be mistaken if they think that the
cut in German interest rates will come quickly.
The French franc closed at FFr3.478 against the D-Mark from a previous
FFr3.495. The Danish krone was little changed on the day closing at around
DKr4.0760 against the German currency.
Sterling was caught in tight ranges, little affected by trade figures which
showed that Britain's visible trade gap with non-European Community
countries widened in July. The pound ended down  1/4 pfennig at DM2.5375.
The dollar closed at DM1.6800 from a previous DM1.6865.

SOUTH Korea's three main electronics companies have reported sharply higher
sales and profits for the first half of 1993, writes John Burton in Seoul.
The buoyant results reflect increased exports as the companies benefited
from the depreciation of the Korean won against the Japanese yen.
Total export sales for the three companies rose 52 per cent, while domestic
sales rose 7 per cent.
Samsung Electronics reported a 81 per cent jump in net earnings to Won56.2bn
(Dollars 70.6m). Sales climbed 32 per cent to 2,850bn.
Goldstar's net profits rose 441 per cent to Won30bn, on sales of Won2,040bn.
Its leading exports were televisions, VCRs and air conditioners.
Daewoo Electronics had net profits of Won13.6bn, up 21 per cent, on sales of
Won805bn.

FT  21 AUG 93 / International Company News: China Resources steps from the
shadows - A look at the 1997 ambitions of a large but quiet mainland
conglomerate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As mainland companies jockey for control and influence in Hong Kong in the
lead-up to 1997, China Resources is emerging as a strong candidate to fill
any corporate power vacuum that might be left after the hand-over.
For a group which has been in Hong Kong for 45 years, China Resources'
profile has been virtually invisible. And this is despite its 10,000
employees and a handful of monopoly trading businesses. It is now making a
determined effort to compete more openly.
The group has a spread of businesses similar to that of the giant Jardine
Matheson group, covering trading, retailing, property development, hotels
and infrastructure. It also has investments in energy and transportation.
Mr Frank Ning, managing director of China Resources Enterprises (CRE), the
group's main stock market-listed arm, said the parent company had assets of
HKDollars 45bn (USDollars 5.8bn) and achieved group turnover of HKDollars
60bn last year.
China Resources' current focus is on developing an efficient and competitive
listed empire, to help complete its evolution from over-staffed bureaucracy
to powerful corporate entity. Mr Ning admits: 'Before we didn't have to
operate like a company, we operated like a government department. We must
try to adapt ourselves to the new environment, otherwise the bureaucracy
will kill this company.'
China Resources is owned by the ministry of foreign economic relations and
trade, and its former role was as a tool of China's economic policy.
However, Mr Ning claims the group is now more independent of its parent than
many other listed Chinese companies.
It may not be easy for the group to adapt. 'It is a different working
environment. You can call it freedom, or you can call it pressure,' said the
35-year old Mr Ning, one of the numerous US-educated mainlanders emerging on
Hong Kong's corporate scene.
CRE came into being when China Resources purchased a minority stake in
Winland Investment, a shell company, in 1986. Over the past 12 months,
following the rapid injection of China Resources' existing Hong Kong
businesses, CRE's stock market capitalisation has jumped from HKDollars 300m
to HKDollars 3.2bn.
The group has one significant advantage over the other key Chinese investor
in Hong Kong, Citic Pacific. It has long-term experience of operating
businesses and building assets, rather than just trading investments.
The three businesses China Resources is currently considering selling to its
listed company are: Ng Fung Hong, the monopoly importer of livestock from
China; China Resources Petroleum, the monopoly importer of petroleum
products; and the group's retail operations, which have a substantial
percentage of the market for Chinese arts and crafts.
These have all been built up with the support of the state, and are now so
strongly established that competition would be prohibitively expensive. The
group should therefore benefit from the loosening of government controls,
even though they come at the cost of guaranteed monopolistic privileges.
However, it is not the existing businesses which are attracting investors to
CRE, or any other so-called 'red-chip', mainland-controlled companies. It is
the anticipation of political leverage after 1997.
These companies already have undoubted advantages when it comes to investing
in China. Although China Resources has ploughed back USDollars 500m into the
domestic economy, in the past it has had little choice over where the money
went. Now, however, it can use its Beijing connections to command quality
deals.
Brokers expect the same could become true in Hong Kong. Mr Clive Weedon,
research director of Nomura Securities, argues: 'The new Chinese hongs will
be able to use their mainland pedigree to win infrastructural and property
deals from a post-1997 government.'
This influence has already been demonstrated in their ability to take on
influential shareholders - Mr Li Ka-shing's Cheung Kong group owns 8 per
cent of CRE, while the Kwok family's Sun Hung Kai Properties owns 10 per
cent - and to do business with the territory's leading tycoons.
The group purchased 50 per cent of the Hong Kong Chinese Bank from the
Indonesian Lippo Group. It has acquired 10 per cent of the colony's leading
port operator, Hong Kong International Terminals, and a 51 per cent stake in
a 6.7m sq ft property development with Mr Li Ka-shing.
In a city where connections are crucial, this is an advantage. However, the
strength - and real test - of this advantage will ultimately depend on an
ability to run these businesses as successfully along the lines of the
established houses of Jardine, Swire, Hutchison and World.

FT  21 AUG 93 / International Company News: Theme park closure talk
dismissed by Disney
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Michael Eisner, chairman of Walt Disney, the US entertainment and leisure
group, has dismissed as 'ridiculous' speculation that EuroDisneyland, the
French theme park, may be forced to close because of financial problems.
Euro Disney, the park's operator, which is 49 per cent-owned by Disney, is
in severe financial difficulty. It is negotiating with banks to restructure
its finances, and is dependent on its US parent company for financial
support until those discussions are completed.
Mr Eisner, speaking in an interview with Variety, the US entertainment
magazine, said EuroDisneyland, the most expensive leisure attraction ever
built in Europe, had been 'monumentally successful with the consumer' since
its opening in April last year.
He denied press speculation that the group was considering either closing
EuroDisneyland, or moth-balling the park during the slack winter season.
Mr Eisner said Euro Disney's losses - which reached FFr1.08bn (Dollars 183m)
in its last financial year and are expected to rise to FFr2bn this year -
were not 'a tremendous loss' to the Disney group. 'We'd do it all over
again,' he said.
However, the Disney chairman's comments failed to calm investors' nerves.
Euro Disney's share price slipped from FFr57 to FFr56.80 yesterday, having
already fallen sharply from FFr65.25 at the start of the week.
EuroDisneyland has been beset by problems ever since its opening.
It attracted more than 11m visitors in its first year - becoming the second
most popular attraction in France after Notre Dame cathedral - but has
fallen well below target in terms of merchandise sales, catering revenue and
hotel occupancy.
These problems have been aggravated by the burden of servicing Euro Disney's
debt, which now stands at more than FFr21bn.
Because of this, Euro Disney has been left with serious cash flow
difficulties. The group last month confirmed it had been forced to delay
plans to build a second theme park and to ask Disney for support while it
tried to restructure its finances.

<TEXT>
INDEPENDENT Newspapers, New Zealand's biggest publishing group, yesterday
reported a 34.3 per cent rise in after-tax profits, to NZDollars 41.16m
(USDollars 22.9m) for the year ended June 30.
Mr Alan Burnet, chairman, said the group, which publishes papers in New
Zealand, Australia and the US and is 51 per cent-owned by News Corporation,
was planning for continuing strong growth.
Turnover rose 4.4 per cent, to NZDollars 965.6m, and operating profit before
abnormal items and tax was up 26.4 per cent to NZDollars 73m.
Mr Burnet said profit margins widened to 7.6 per cent from 6.1 per cent last
year. This followed an upturn at the Gordon and Gotch advertising business,
and the the introduction of new technology in newspaper publishing.
He said the company was buying the 127-year-old paper, The Nelson Evening
Mail.
The deal would consolidate its position as New Zealand's biggest publishing
company.
Natural Gas Corp, the big gas utility, reports an after-tax profit of
NZDollars 17.8m for the year ended June. The result is 19 per cent ahead of
the prospectus forecast given when the company was floated last September.
The company is controlled by Fletcher Challenge and the Australian Gas Light
Company.
Mr Bill Falconer, chairman, attributed the result to higher growth rates in
residential sales, lower interest rates, reduced operating costs, and
improved contributions from equity profits.

FT  21 AUG 93 / International Company News: Saab-Scania blamed for 80% slide
at Investor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INVESTOR, the main holding company of Sweden's powerful Wallenberg family,
yesterday blamed a worse performance from Saab-Scania, its vehicle and
aerospace arm, and lower capital gains, for an 80 per cent drop in
first-half profits after financial items, to SKr406m (Dollars 51m).
Capital gains were SKr1bn less than a year ago, at SKr986m, while
Saab-Scania's profits fell to SKr581m from SKr1.17bn following weak demand
for many of its key products, including trucks, buses and aircraft.
Investor says it expects Saab-Scania's full-year profits to be
'significantly lower' than 1992's SKr2.13bn. However, it did not give a
forecast for the group result.
All Saab-Scania's business areas reported lower income, except Saab-Scania
Finance. Group sales fell 5 per cent to SKr13bn, while order bookings
tumbled to SKr12.3bn from SKr23.3bn.
Sales of trucks and buses fell to SKr8.19bn from SKr8.38bn, as the number of
units sold dropped to 12,400 from 15,000. Although Saab Aircraft sales were
unchanged at SKr1.77bn, new orders contracted sharply to SKr1.1bn from
SKr12.0bn.
Saab-Scania is a half owner in Saab Automobile, which earlier reported a
SKr684m loss after financial items for the first half.
It is also the leading member of the consortium manufacturing the JAS 39
Gripen multi-role fighter jet.
It says it faced extra costs following the spectacular crash of one of the
aircraft in central Stockholm two weeks ago, but hoped to have made the
necessary changes to the steering system - which has been blamed for the
disaster - within a month.
Investor said the value of its strategic investment portfolio, which
includes stakes in Swedish blue chips Astra, Ericsson, and Stora, amounted
to SKr21.6bn at June 30. This represents an underlying 6 per cent increase
in value since the start of the year, well below the overall 19 per cent
increase in the stock market.
Group net worth has fallen to SKr25.4bn from SKr32.4bn since the year end,
primarily because of the fall in Saab-Scania's earnings.

Dollars 20m.
The purchase gives Alcatel, Europe's largest telecommunications equipment
maker, 65 per cent of Teletas, Turkey's second largest telecoms producer.
Teletas has a 40 per cent share of the Turkish market in big digital
switches, and is the only transmission equipment maker in Turkey.
The company has recently established joint ventures to supply public
exchanges in Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Azerbaijan.
In 1984 Alcatel bought 39 per cent of the company from PTT, the state post
and telecommunications monopoly. Last month, it acquired 8 per cent from
Teletas minority shareholders, the construction company STFA, and Ray
Insurance.
The decision to buy a controlling stake reflects Alcatel's strategy of
expanding its position in the region. For the Turkish government, the deal
marks a further government withdrawal from the telecommunications sector.
Separately, the cabinet has approved legal changes to PTT ahead of the
creation of a separate telecoms group. A planned global share offering of 15
per cent of this company could raise up to Dollars 2bn.
The postal company will retain up to 49 per cent of the new telecom concern.
The government is understood to be considering a regionalisation of the PTT
units before selling them.

FT  21 AUG 93 / International Company News: Finnish bank plans FM1bn equity
issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
KANSALLIS-Osake-Pankki, Finland's leading commercial bank, is preparing an
international share issue worth up to FM1bn (Dollars 173m) as part of plans
to raise almost FM3bn in new capital.
The bank has already raised FM1.25bn from share and bond issues this year,
but says more funds are needed to withstand expected losses in 1993 and
1994.
The aim is to have a capital adequacy ratio of around 10 or 11 per cent,
well above the 8 per cent international minimum, by 1995, when the bank
expects to return to the black.
In February it said it was looking to raise FM3bn through share and bond
issues to avoid having to call on direct state support. It now wants to
launch an additional share issue.
Interest from international investors is said to be strong following
evidence of improving fortunes in the entire Finnish banking sector. During
the past 12 months, KOP's share price has doubled to FM16.50.
The aim is to launch the international share issue in the autumn, while
making preference capital and perpetual debt issues worth up to FM1.8bn over
the next 18 months. The capital note and bond offers, which will primarily
be targetted at the US market, will be backed by a state guarantee.
KOP's loss before provisions and taxes deepened to FM626m from FM527m in the
first four months. However, it still hopes to halve its FM3.7bn 1992 loss
over the full year.
Gambro, the Swedish medical equipment maker, said yesterday first-half
pre-tax profits rose 25 per cent, to SKr495m (Dollars 62.18m) from SKr396m a
year earlier.
Although sales climbed 42 per cent to SKr4.33bn from SKr3.05bn, the rise
would only have been 10 per cent without the effect of acquisitions and the
depreciation of the krona.
The group said it expected its earnings trend to remain favourable over the
rest of the year. Last year's pre-tax income amounted to SKr753m.

FT  21 AUG 93 / Commodities and Agricuture: Producer scheme fuels coffee
rally - Week in the Markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT WAS all systems go again on the coffee market during the first half of
this week as news that African producers had agreed to join their Latin
American counterparts' scheme to curb exports lent fresh buoyancy to prices.
The November position on the London Commodity Exchange climbed Dollars 98
from last Friday's close to peak on Wednesday at Dollars 1,220 a tonne, up
Dollars 253 from a month earlier. The market had become overbought in the
process and profit-taking trimmed the price to Dollars 1,201 at yesterday's
close; but sentiment remained bullish and traders said there was scope for a
further substantial retracement without breaking the uptrend.
The co-operation of the 25 members of the Inter-African Coffee Organisation
means that the scheme to withhold 20 per cent of production from the export
market, which is due to come into operation on October 1, should, if
faithfully adhered to, result in about 10m bags (60kg each) being retained
in producing countries during the 1993-94 crop year. Based on estimates by
London trade house ED &amp; F. Man that would be equivalent to nearly 14 per
cent of annual world demand and about half the present level of consumer
stocks.
The producers' scheme is designed to fill the gap left by the collapse in
1989 of the International Coffee Organisation's export quota system,
following which world coffee prices plunged by about 60 per cent. After
repeated failures, attempts to revive the ICO pact, in which consuming
countries were involved as well as producers, were abandoned in March and
producers decided that self-help was their only remaining option.
The retention scheme was greeted initially with considerable scepticism, but
international traders have gradually come to believe in the producers'
determination to make it work. Whether determination will prove to be enough
is another matter, however. Financing the holding of such large stocks will
impose a heavy burden on cash-strapped African governments; and policing the
scheme is bound to present problems.
One delegate at this week's IACO meeting in Kampala commented: 'Commodity
pacts have had a high failure rate in the past. . . The retention scheme is
a temporary solution, with problems of sustainability'.
The London cocoa market also put in a strong performance this week, though
the real scale of the rise was partially obscured by sterling's rise against
the US dollar. The December futures contract at the LCE reached a 20-month
peak of Pounds 792 a tonne before closing yesterday at Pounds 779 a tonne,
up Pounds 18 on the week, but the rise might have been Pounds 26 larger had
it not been for the currency factor. Manufacturer buying interest was noted
in the London market on Monday, but the main power behind the rise came from
the New York market, where speculators succeeded on Wednesday in breaking
through determined resistance at Dollars 1,017 a tonne for December futures.
At the London Metal Exchange signs of an easing in the nearby supply
tightness that has been distorting the copper market allowed the three
months position to test support around the Dollars 1,900-a-tonne mark. The
support held, but only just; every day the three months position traded
below that level (the lowest being Dollars 1,890 on Thursday) but only
Wednesday saw a sub-Dollars 1,900 closing price. Yesterday three months
metal closed at Dollars 1,904.50 a tonne, up Dollars 1.50 on the week, while
its discount against cash metal (a reflection of the technical tightness)
had narrowed since last Friday from Pounds 40 to Dollars 33 a tonne.
Nickel fared less well. Continued trade hedging of Russian material pushed
the three months price to a fresh 6-year low of Dollars 4,620 a tonne in
mid-week before short-covering reversed the trend. The 'correction' carried
the price to Dollars 4,825 yesterday morning before it subsided to close at
Dollars 4,742.50 a tonne, down Dollars 85 on the week.
The long-rumoured announcement of a cut in aluminium output by Reynolds
Metals, the second-biggest US producer, finally arrived this week, but it
did little for market sentiment. Reynolds said it would close temporarily
another 88,000 tonnes of annual capacity because of the worldwide
supply/demand imbalance that has been weighing on the market. A slight price
rally ensued, but that had as much to do with fears that a train drivers
strike might force the closure of Romania's 263,000-tonnes-a-year Alro
smelter.
The market's resumption of its downward course was hastened, however, by the
revelation that Alro was only operating at a rate of 110,000 tonnes a year.
The price continued to sink until determined defence emerged at the Dollars
1,170-a-tonne mark to counter selling by speculators who were reported to be
trying to trigger US investment fund liquidation by breaching that key chart
level. The defenders succeeded in repelling the onslaught and the three
months price ended the week at Dollars 1,173.50 a tonne, down Dollars 33.75
on balance.
Gold moved towards the upper end of its recent narrow trading range this
week, but never seriously threatened to break into higher ground. The
re-emergence of US investment fund buying lifted the London bullion market
price by Dollars 5 to Dollars 373.75 a troy ounce on Monday and at
yesterday's close it stood at Dollars 373.25 an ounce.

FT  21 AUG 93 / UK Company News: All quiet on the Hartstone front
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   AYLESBURY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ONE Hartstone shareholder summed up sentiment at yesterday's annual meeting
before it even began: 'They have got someone at the top now who hopefully
knows where he is going]'
Even the chairman of the struggling hosiery and leather goods group, Mr
Shaun Dowling, who replaced the company's founder, Mr Stephen Barker, in
May, was not prepared for such confident support.
He described himself as somewhat 'surprised' by the lack of excitement
following the roller-coaster performance of the company's shares in recent
months.
They have fallen from a 12-month high of 307p to yesterday's 61p after three
profits warnings and the revelation of pre-tax losses of Pounds 9.9m for
1992 following a spectacular acquisitions spree across Europe in recent
years.
'I would not have minded more questions,' said Mr Dowling, who had to answer
only two from the small group of shareholders who attended the half-hour
meeting.
Perhaps it was the atmosphere of the venue, the luxurious 16th-century
Hartwell House hotel, once a home of King Louis XVIII of France, which moved
shareholders to silence.
It may have been Mr Dowling's own manner which one shareholder described as
'intimidating . . . one was not encouraged to talk.'
Most of the 20 or so private shareholders who turned up seemed to have
suffered from wilful amnesia over the company's recent troubles. 'It's a new
board, isn't it?' said one.
Mr Dowling said Hartstone had begun the process of disposing of certain
non-core businesses. Speculation centres on disposal of one of Hartstone's
larger companies.
The last shadows of the old Hartstone were dispersed with the announcement
that Mr David Gratton, former finance director, was stepping down from the
board.

FT  21 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Mersey in talks with Medway
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MERSEY Docks &amp; Harbour Company announced yesterday that it was 'in the
early stages of exclusive discussions' which could lead to it acquiring
Medway Ports, bought by its management and employees for Pounds 54m and the
assumption of Pounds 17m of debt in March 1992.
Earlier this week Medway revealed that it had received a number of
approaches from potential bidders, including Forth Ports and Powell Duffryn.
Neither Mersey nor Medway would reveal details about the talks because
confidentiality agreements have been signed.
However, at the beginning of the month, when he was announcing plans for
Medway's stock market flotation - expected to raise about Pounds 70m - Mr
Peter Vincent, its chief executive, did not rule out the possibility of
becoming part of a larger ports group.
In February, Mr Trevor Furlong, Mersey's managing director, said that Mersey
Docks was still looking to buy an east coast port that would provide synergy
at the European end of a UK land bridge.
The reasons Medway would favour a merger with Mersey are thought to include
the prospects for the enlarged business, price, and management teams which
see eye to eye. A combined Mersey/Medway would be the second largest
grouping after Associated British Ports.
Medway controls Sheerness, a deep water port which has eschewed containers
and handles cars and fruit and forest produce.
Medway also controls the former Royal Navy dockyard at Chatham, which
includes 140 acres of development land next to the Medway road tunnel,
currently under construction.
The government still holds a 20 per cent stake in Mersey which the company
said would be sold when 'appropriate'.
The Labour Party last night accused the government of privatising Medway,
which was owned by a local trust, for 'a knock down price'.
Ms Joan Walley, shadow transport minister, said she would call on Sir John
Bourn, the comptroller and auditor general, to hold an investigation into
last year's sale.
The Department of Trade and Industry said Medway was 'a private sector port
and it's up to them what they now do.'

FT  21 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Injecting extra fizz into its global
ambitions - Cadbury Schweppes' Pounds 154m soft drinks move
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CADBURY Schweppes' Pounds 154.2m acquisition of a further 20.2 per cent
stake in Dr Pepper/Seven-Up is widely regarded as only a preliminary move
towards strengthening its position in the Dollars 47bn US soft drinks
market.
'The deal shows that the group has recognised its weakness in the market. It
does not, by itself, enable it to break through its limitations,' said one
industry analyst.
Cadbury's position in US soft drinks encapsulates its wider strategic
problem. It has outgrown the UK, but not yet achieved the stature it needs
to become a real force in the international league.
Its overseas operations, encompassing some 170 countries, are widely but
thinly spread. It is the leader in only a few, mostly Commonwealth markets.
Though the world's third largest soft drinks producer, its 4 per cent share
of the global market puts it well behind Coca-Cola and Pepsico. Schweppes
and Canada Dry may be global brands, but most of its portfolio consists of
niche products with limited mass market appeal.
Similarly in the international confectionery business, it lags substantially
behind Nestle and Philip Morris.
Cadbury's argument that exploitation of profitable market sectors is more
important than market leadership and scale has done little to allay concerns
about its longer-term growth. The group's further investment in Dr
Pepper/Seven-Up appears to many sceptics to promise a more realistic
strategical approach.
Cadbury first acquired a stake in Dr Pepper in 1986/87, and after the
company's merger with Seven-Up in 1988 was left with a 5.7 per cent
shareholding in the combined group.
Dr Pepper/Seven-Up is the third largest US soft drinks franchiser and one of
the fastest growing companies in the US carbonated drinks industry, lifting
sales last year by 7 per cent in a total market that grew only 1.5 per cent.
Sales of brands such as Dr Pepper and Seven-Up give it a 10.6 per cent share
of the Dollars 47bn soft drinks market. Last year, the group reported
operating profits of Dollars 160.6m on sales of Dollars 658.7m, and a net
loss, after charges incurred in two aborted attempts to make a share issue
in the US.
Dr Pepper produces the bulk of Cadbury's soft drinks concentrates for the US
market and acts as sales agent for some of its drinks brands in the food
service sector.
The alliance has made Cadbury the fourth largest soft drinks company in the
US with a 3.4 per cent share of the market. Brands such as Schweppes, Canada
Dry and Sunkist are distributed through more than 850 independent bottlers,
and the operation also markets a range of juices.
Mr Dominic Cadbury, chairman, said yesterday that he regarded the share
acquisition as 'an excellent opportunity' to increase substantially the
group's investment both in Dr Pepper and in the US soft drinks industry.
Nobody believes that will be the end of the matter; that Cadbury will merely
rest on its 25.9 per cent shareholding.
The group signalled its intention yesterday of continuing discussions on
'further ways in which the two companies can co-operate to maximise their
respective strengths.'
Analysts believe there are only two ways forward if Cadbury is to get more
competitive muscle out of its investment: a full-blown takeover of Dr Pepper
or the injection of its brands into the company in exchange for additional
equity.
Cadbury and Dr Pepper have already discussed the terms of an acceptable
standstill agreement on further share-buying by the UK group - and the talks
will continue.
Mr Dominic Cadbury denied that a full takeover plan lay behind yesterday's
deal, but said he was ruling out nothing in the longer term. 'I would not
rule out a further step in the future, but equally we have no plans for
that. We're not ruling it in, we're not ruling it out.'
Mr Cadbury showed little inclination yesterday to get involved in the
management of Dr Pepper - and though Cadbury tried to buy the company in the
1980s, few involved in the industry believe a renewed bid is unlikely.
'Dr Pepper's management certainly does not want to surrender control of the
company,' said one analyst. 'The price of a hostile bid for the remaining 75
per cent shareholding would be close to Pounds 1bn. Cadbury would need a
rights issue to fund it, and with gearing already up to 80 per cent, that
would cause some concern in the City of London.'
The City would certainly feel easier if Cadbury, instead, were to inject its
carbonate brands into Dr Pepper in exchange for cash and another slice of
stock.
Though Cadbury would cede management control, its long-term interests in the
market, some analysts argue, would be better served by owning, say, 35 per
cent of a company with a 14 per cent to 15 per cent share of the US market.
The combination of brands would have more appeal to independent bottlers and
give the operation greater competitive strength.
It could also provide the foundation for developing the growth of Cadbury
and Dr Pepper brands in tandem in other international markets.

FT  21 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Bristol &amp; West doubles to Pounds 20.4m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRISTOL &amp; WEST, the 10th largest building society, which has been troubled
by high levels of bad debt, yesterday disclosed doubled pre-tax profit at
the half year and said it had reduced mortgage arrears significantly.
The society, whose long and short-term debt ratings were downgraded last
month by the European ratings agency, IBCA, because of high levels of
arrears, disclosed a jump in pre-tax profits to Pounds 20.4m (Pounds 9.5m).
The percentage rise was increased by the adoption of the FRS 3 accounting
standard, which meant a restatement of last year's first half profits from
Pounds 13.1m.
Mr Tony FitzSimons, the society's chief executive, said total mortgage
arrears had fallen by 19 per cent on the end of 1992, while the value of
mortgages more than 12 months in arrears had dropped by 15 per cent from
Pounds 102m to Pounds 87m.
The society was badly affected in the first half of last year by a fourfold
rise in provisions for bad debts because of a fall in the value of
repossessed homes. Mr FitzSimons said the society was now selling
repossession actively.
Provisions rose 11.4 per cent to Pounds 33.1m (Pounds 29.7m) because of
suspended interest and the realising of losses on repossessed properties. Mr
FitzSimons predicted that full-year provisions would be down on last year's
total of Pounds 74.1m.
Net interest income rose to Pounds 78.3m (Pounds 64.2m) and other operating
income moved up to Pounds 35.2m (Pounds 30.6m). Expenses also grew to Pounds
60m (Pounds 55.6m) as the society wrote off goodwill on Channel Islands
estate agency and a housing association acquisition.
The society's capital ratios increased through the retention of Pounds 14.5m
post-tax profit and the issue of Pounds 75m sub-ordinated debt. Gross
capital was 7.3 per cent of share and deposit liabilities, against 6.2 per
cent at the end of 1992.

FT  21 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Bailey sells 4.4m Bristol Ship shares
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR CHRISTOPHER Bailey, outgoing chairman of Bristol Channel Ship Repairers,
has sold 4.4m shares owned by his family interests at 10p each to the
Norwegian company which won control of the UK ship management company
earlier this year.
The shares were suspended at 8p on Thursday at the company's request because
it had started talks with Mr Andreas O Ugland, chairman-designate, and other

FT  21 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Exceptionals leave Raglan Pounds 2.4m in
red
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER allowing Pounds 1.49m for additional write-offs and a reduction in
property values, Raglan Property Trust, the property developer and investor,
incurred a pre-tax loss of Pounds 2.44m for the year ended March 31 1993.
That compared with Pounds 1.58m last time when there were exceptional
charges amounting to Pounds 960,000.
Turnover came to Pounds 354,000 (Pounds 9.49m), generating a gross profit of
Pounds 268,000 against Pounds 80,000.
Losses per share worked through at 1.4p compared with 0.9p.
In April a capital reconstruction took effect, which included raising Pounds
7m of new equity, converting Pounds 3m of principal creditors' debt into
equity and repaying the balance of their debt.
As a result the company's finances were now on a more secure basis.
Since the year-end progress had been made with the development proposals for
the shopping centre in Banbury.
Also, 18 freehold shops were acquired from Dunn &amp; Co and Philips Pension
Fund for Pounds 7.5m at an average yield of 9.3 per cent.
Finance came from a Pounds 6.3m loan from NM Rothschild with the balance
from Raglan's own resources.

FT  21 AUG 93 / UK Company News: BSM hopes to raise up to Pounds 50m in
flotation to help fund expansion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BSM GROUP, owner of the British School of Motoring, one of the largest
franchisers in the UK, is aiming to raise between Pounds 40m and Pounds 50m
when it is floated on the London Stock Exchange in mid-October.
Announcing the long expected flotation yesterday, Mr Paul Massey, chief
executive, said the money would be used to repay about Pounds 30m of debt
from the management buy-out of the company in 1990.
It is on high fixed interest rates so a lower interest bill post-flotation
and the new money raised will help fund the group's expansion.
BSM reported an operating profit of Pounds 4.1m on turnover of Pounds 21m
last year. For the six months to July 2 this year operating profit was
Pounds 2.2m on turnover of Pounds 11.8m.
It is the largest driving school in the UK, and the only one with a national
presence. It operates through 134 branches spread between Aberdeen and
Plymouth and has 2,000 self-employed instructors.
Founded in 1910 by an Edwardian motoring enthusiast, the company was
acquired in 1973 by Sir Anthony Jacobs, a businessman with wide interests.
He was hoping to retain it but decided to sell when he retired and his son
wanted to pursue other interests.
The Pounds 40m management buy-out, which topped offers from car makers and
leasing companies anxious to secure a captive market, was led by Morgan
Grenfell Development Capital Partners.
At the time of the flotation Morgan Grenfell will own 70 per cent, the
Jacobs family 20 per cent and the balance of 10 per cent is held by
management.
Both Mr Massey and Mr Richard Glover, managing director of the company, said
yesterday that they would not be selling any of their shares.
They own 30 per cent and 20 per cent respectively of the 21-strong
management group's stake.
Morgan Grenfell is sponsoring the flotation and James Capel are brokers.

FT  21 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Thomas Jourdan cuts loss to Pounds 0.5m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THOMAS JOURDAN, the diversified manufacturing group, is seeing the benefit
of restructuring undertaken over the last three years, and has almost halved
its loss.
For the six months ended June 30 the group incurred a pre-tax deficit of
Pounds 465,000, compared with Pounds 874,000, from turnover of Pounds 8.96m
(Pounds 8.9m). There was a Pounds 67,000 (Pounds 290,000) exceptional
charge, this time representing the cost of holding surplus properties.
The group makes trouser and tie presses, decorative fire surrounds, handles
for cabinet furniture, cosmetic and industrial brushes, and solid wood
fitted furniture.
Mr Keith Whitten, chairman, said a significantly larger part of profits came
in the second half. The improvement in trading was mainly the result of
rationalisation and innovation and from the launch of new products.
His belief that the group would perform satisfactorily in the rest of the
year was not based on any dramatic upturn in consumer demand, but 'rather on
the fact that we have efficient well run businesses able to trade profitably
at current levels of activity'.
In the half year losses per share were cut to 2.59p (4.86p). The interim
dividend is again 0.5p, payable January 6.

Sibelco says it speaks for 47.1 per cent of the capital and has extended the
offer to September 7. Prior to the start of the offer it held or had
unconditionally agreed to acquire 30.4 per cent of the capital.
Subsequently, it agreed to purchase Quarzwerke's entire holding of 14.8 per

FT  21 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Eurotunnel seeks help from French
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE International Chamber of Commerce in Paris was yesterday asked by
Eurotunnel to arbitrate in a long running dispute between the operator of
the Channel tunnel and British Rail and SNCF, the UK and French national
railways.
The dispute relates to the railway usage contract signed in 1987 between the
railways and Eurotunnel, the company which built and will operate the
Channel tunnel.
Eurotunnel claims that the contract 'can no longer deliver the balance of
benefits envisaged by the parties at the time it was agreed'. Failure to
change the contract could cost it tens of millions of pounds it believes.
However British Rail and SNCF in a joint statement said: 'Eurotunnel has
chosen to fabricate a dispute with their principal customers (the railways)
. . . . We do not have a dispute with Eurotunnel. We believe that all
parties should now work wholeheartedly together for a successful launch of
the cross Channel service on the basis of the contract'.
The contract says that 50 per cent of tunnel capacity should be made
available to the railways against payments related to volume of traffic and
operating costs. That would allow the railways to carry 17.4m passengers and
8.1m tonnes of freight each year.
However railway usage in the early years of tunnel operation, from next
year, is now expected to be far less than at the time the contract was
signed - and therefore Eurotunnel's revenue from the railways will be less.
In part, this shortfall is due to the late arrival and slow build-up of
scheduled passenger train services, according to Eurotunnel.
The contract also set out the railways' obligations in respect of
infrastructure at each end of the tunnel to support the volume of tunnel
traffic.
Eurotunnel alleges the infrastructure in the UK, in particular the station
at Ashford in Kent, is inadequate and that rail capacity in the UK,
especially on Network South East, will be insufficient for the rest of the
decade.
Sir Alastair Morton, Eurotunnel's co-chairman, recently said that the French
railways had by contrast performed 'splendidly' in providing infrastructure
on that side of the Channel.

FT  21 AUG 93 / Letters to the Editor: Abandoning Thorp nuclear plant would
cost UK jobs, trade and investment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JOHN R S GUINNESS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Contrary to the impression given by your leader of August 5 ('Nuclear
decision') and letters in your August 12 edition, there will be no winners
if the Thorp nuclear waste processing plant is cancelled but only losers,
notably the Treasury, the UK's reputation as an international trading nation
and responsible haven for inward investment, and the west Cumbrian economy.
Greenpeace attacked Thorp on environmental grounds. Yet after two years of
scrutinising the plant and considering voluminous representations, the
Pollution Inspectorate and the Ministry of Agriculture Fisheries and Food
concluded: 'The provisions of the draft authorisations (covering Thorp)
would effectively protect human health, the safety of the food chain and the
environment generally.'
Greenpeace now claims that our customers would like to withdraw from their
contracts. This is equally unfounded. Statements of support from Nuclear
Electric and Scottish Nuclear and from our European customers have been
published in the documents circulated by the Department of the Environment.
A full-page advertisement appeared in the FT on June 23 headed 'The Japanese
utility companies want Thorp'. If the Japanese utilities had turned against
reprocessing, why would they be constructing their own reprocessing plant in
Japan?
Thorp's cancellation would also gravely damage our position as an
international trading nation. Consider the likely impact on our trade and
inward investment projects with Japan and Europe if we had to inform the
Japanese and European utilities that their Pounds 1.9bn investment in Thorp
would be written off.
The Friends of the Earth alternative - apparently endorsed by your leader -
of turning west Cumbria into an international nuclear spent-fuel store would
represent a staggering U-turn in Friends of the Earth and government policy,
and is fundamentally flawed. Our customers want their recycled fuel back.
Some would almost certainly transfer their business to France if the UK
cancelled Thorp.
The idea that this U-turn would solve Cumbria's employment problems is
naive. Thorp will support more than 3,000 jobs in west Cumbria and about
6,000 in the UK. These are long-term manufacturing-related jobs, many of
them highly skilled. By contrast, the jobs involved in knocking down Thorp
would be short-term. No more than 100 jobs would be supported by dry
storage. Your suggestion that Thorp be dismantled and transported to Japan
is even more naive, as any first-year engineering student will know.
The economic case for Thorp is very robust. The Treasury would have killed
Thorp during the past 12 months if it had not been convinced of our economic
case and of the economic folly of those who wish to turn Thorp into Europe's
largest white elephant.

FT  21 AUG 93 / Bugs that come to plague us: The renewed war against disease
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A virulent new strain of cholera emerges from India. Diphtheria strikes at
the heart of European Russia. Hantavirus starts killing Navajo Indians in
the south-western US. Drug resistance fuels a resurgence of the world's two
biggest killers, tuberculosis and malaria. And the global Aids epidemic
sweeps on.
The current spate of stories about plague and pestilence may hasten the end
of what the US Institute of Medicine calls an 'era of complacency' - a
period of about 30 years, during which the medical profession and general
public assumed that they had won the war on acute infections and focused
instead on chronic degenerative disorders such as cancer, heart disease and
mental illness.
'We claimed victory too soon,' said Dr Robert Shope, professor of
epidemiology at Yale University and co-chairman of the institute's committee
on emerging infections. 'The danger posed by infectious diseases has not
gone away. It's worsening.'
Changes in the environment, in human behaviour and in the microbes
themselves are interacting in a complex way to set the stage for new
diseases to emerge and old ones to reappear. The main factors include:
Poverty and population growth. Diseases thrive in overcrowded third world
cities with inadequate sanitation and unclear water. An alarming example is
a new strain of cholera now spreading fast through the Indian sub-continent;
meanwhile the previous cholera epidemic, which originated in Indonesia in
1961 and reached South America in 1991, is still killing thousands of people
a year.
Development of forests. The rapid human intrusion into tropical forests is
exposing people to new reservoirs of infection in animals and insects.
Several 'new' diseases are probably caused by old monkey viruses, including
Aids, Ebola and Marburg fever. In the eastern US, the rapid increase in Lyme
disease is due mainly to housing development close to wooded areas; the
bacteria responsible are carried by ticks from woodland mice and deer -
their normal hosts - to people living nearby.
International travel and commerce. Increased mobility can spread a new
disease rapidly around the globe wherever it arises. Aids, for example,
probably took hold first in tropical Africa, travelled along the
Mombasa-Kinshasa highway with truck drivers, soldiers and prostitutes - and
reached the western hemisphere by air.
Farming and food processing. Intensive animal rearing can transfer germs
from animals to humans. Microbiologists believe that the most dangerous
strains of influenza arise in south China where integrated pig-duck farming
is practiced; the animals act as genetic 'mixing vessels' in which genes
from different flu viruses are recombined. Today's record levels of
salmonella food poisoning in Europe and north America are linked to
large-scale poultry production.
Civil unrest and political instability. Pestilence has been linked with
warfare throughout history; a current example is the epidemic of Kala-Azar,
a virulent form of leishmaniasis, a disease spread by sandflies which has
killed an estimated 50,000 people as a result of the prolonged civil war in
southern Sudan. Political disruption can also lead to disease, as the
current outbreak of diphtheria in Russia shows; its principal cause seems to
be a breakdown of the immunisation system in the former Soviet Union.
Drug resistance. Misuse of antibiotics has produced drug-resistant strains
of many bacteria. In western industrialised countries, thousands of people
die every year from antibiotic-resistant infections which they pick up while
in hospital for other reasons. Tuberculosis, which kills 3m people a year
worldwide, is beginning to acquire antibiotic resistance. And the fight
against malaria, now responsible for 2m deaths a year, is hampered both by
drug-resistance in the microscopic parasite that causes the disease and by
pesticide-resistance in the mosquitoes that carry it.
Many microbes can undergo genetic changes at frightening speed - either
random mutations or responses to environmental forces. As Mr Robert Walgate
of the World Health Organisation's tropical diseases research unit put it,
'one can see the 20th century, subjecting micro-organisms to so many
pressures, as the most ambitious short-term experiment in evolution in the
history of the world'.
Under those circumstances, it is not surprising that some unpleasant new
forms of viruses and bacteria arise. For example the latest cholera strain,
known officially as 0139 Bengal, causes similar symptoms to its predecessor
 -diarrhoea, vomiting and severe dehydration - but appears to last longer in
the environment and may be more difficult to eradicate from water supplies.
Microbiologists advocate a four-pronged strategy to contain the threat of
infectious diseases.
Surveillance. 'Global infectious disease surveillance is the most urgently
needed first step to protect ourselves,' said Dr Stephen Morse, a virology
professor at New York's Rockefeller University. WHO and the Federation of
American Scientists are sponsoring a conference next month in Geneva, to lay
the foundations of an international network of monitoring centres, located
mainly in the tropics.
The global network would use the latest genetic and computer technology to
spot emerging diseases, rather as the Centres for Disease Control does in
the US. CDC was quick to identify the cause of a mysterious fever that has
killed at least 20 people in the south-western states this year; the fever
was a new Hantavirus spread by mice.
Vaccines. One disease has already been eradicated by mass vaccination:
smallpox in the 1970s. Several others that exist only in humans, with no
animal reservoirs, could be wiped out in the same way and WHO says its
campaign to eradicate polio by 2000 is on target. But prevention of many
other diseases, including malaria and Aids, will require new vaccine
technology.
Drugs. Doctors must learn to be more sparing in their use of antibiotics,
prescribing them only for known bacterial infections; doctors must also stop
contributing to drug resistance by giving broad-spectrum antibiotics to
patients with ill-defined symptoms who are unlikely to benefit. At the same
time, pharmaceutical researchers need to develop not only new classes of
antibiotic but also drugs against viruses and parasitic diseases such as
malaria.
Sanitation and hygiene. As Dr Hiroshi Nakajima, WHO director-general, put
it, 'cholera is the litmus-test of a country's socio-economic well-being.
For as long as there is lack of proper sanitation facilities and safe
drinking water, epidemics of cholera are bound to return, time and again'.
In our present dirty world, with its inadequate drugs, vaccines and
surveillance, is there a threat of more serious epidemics than those raging
today?
The apocalyptic nightmare would be a new microbe combining extreme virulence
 -quickly killing a high proportion of those infected - with high
transmissibility, passing easily from person to person through normal social
contact in an otherwise healthy population.
Fortunately the human virus that came closest to that combination of
virulence and transmissibility is the one already eradicated, smallpox. Some
microbiologists say there are theoretical reasons for believing that the
chances of anything similar arising again are extremely low. Viruses
introduced from animals may cause lethal fevers but they do not pass easily
between humans.
But Dr Shope warns against complacency. 'The most disastrous emerging event
might be another pandemic of influenza, like the 1918-19 pandemic that
killed 20m people worldwide,' he says. 'But we don't know what the next
event is likely to be and we must prepare to be surprised.'

Sir, Your headline 'Audit rap for housing associations' (August 18) bore
little resemblance either to the article that followed or the contents of
the National Audit Office report on which it was based.
As the chief executive of one of the 14 associations included in the NAO
study, I certainly do not feel 'rapped' over my organisation's stewardship
of the public funds made available to us, nor do I believe that the NAO
pinpointed any serious shortcomings in the way in which associations handled
their development programmes.
The growth in the work of associations over the past three years has been
significant and, inevitably, we have had to improve financial forecasting
and learn the requirements of the money markets to raise private finance.
Despite this, our record has been impressive - as the response to the
government's 'housing market package' showed.
While, like many organisations, improvements can always be made I believe
that your headline may lead some readers to have doubts over the work of
associations in general and over the good security they continue to offer
lenders for the future.
David R Hucker,
chief executive,

FT  21 AUG 93 / Summertime special for the stock markets: A look at the
revival in equity prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Happy days are here again. Stock markets in the US, UK, Germany, Hong Kong,
Malaysia, Singapore and Spain recorded all-time highs this week, even though
August is normally a quiet month for share trading.
With economic recovery still sluggish in the US and the UK, and non-existent
in France and Germany, markets might seem to have little to be excited
about. So for those who are still baffled, here is a bull's-eye view of the
euphoria.
Why are stock markets reaching record levels?
'It all comes down to low inflation, low interest rates and low bond
yields,' according to Mr Dick Barfield, chief investment manager at Standard
Life, the insurance company. Bond markets have been rallying round the
world. Lower inflation expectations have boosted bond prices, and so cut
bond yields. Investment institutions regularly switch between bonds and
shares, so as yields on bonds fall, shares become more attractive.
A further factor is that inflation had been so high for so long that
investors in the 1980s demanded a high real (after inflation) return. That
may now be changing.
'The market has now come to believe in lower real interest rates rather than
merely lower nominal interest rates,' says Mr Michael Hughes, head of global
investment strategy at BZW, the securities company. That is more good news
for both equities and bonds, since it allows yields to fall, and thus prices
to rise even further.
Returns on cash deposits are also falling, and expected to fall further,
especially in continental Europe now that the effective collapse of the
exchange rate mechanism allows governments to set economic policy in
relation to their own needs, and not those of the Bundesbank. Again, when
returns on cash fall, the attractions of equities increase.
A small difference in the market yield can make a lot of difference to share
prices. If investors are prepared to accept a 3 per cent, rather than a 4
per cent yield, share prices will rise by 33 per cent.
Lower interest rates are of obvious benefit to industry as they reduce the
cost of doing business and increase profits. All this adds up to a bull
market.
How do markets look in terms of traditional valuation measures, such as
price-earnings ratios and dividend yields?
'Most of the valuation measures look pretty expensive compared with the
1970s and 1980s, although not when you look at the 1960s,' says Mr Barfield.
As Mr Albert Edwards, global equity strategist at Kleinwort Benson, the
securities house, says: 'the UK market is at its most expensive in terms of
the price-earnings ratio since 1972' - a peak which was swiftly followed by
one of the worst bear markets in history.
However, bullish investors and commentators argue that the historic
price-earnings ratio is based on earnings depressed by a long recession. As
economies grow again, earnings will grow rapidly and that means the
prospective p/e ratio is much lower.
The dividend yield on UK shares is currently 3.6 per cent, compared with an
average of 5 per cent over the period 1918-1992; but BZW's Mr Hughes points
out that a large part of that time-period is biased towards those years when
inflation was a problem. The real yield on equities is currently positive,
normally a good sign.
In the US, the dividend yield is even lower, at 2.86 per cent. Historically,
when the yield has dipped below 3 per cent, the stock market has
subsequently dropped sharply, notably in 1929 and 1987. But Mr Hughes argues
that earnings growth is now coming through in the US, so the prospects for
dividend growth are good.
Is it too late to invest?
Private investors have an unfortunate tendency to invest at the top of the
market; the time to sell shares, according to the legend, is when 'elevator
boys' are passing on stock tips.
The UK rally has been so rapid that Mr Barfield says, 'I can't be wildly
bullish but I wouldn't want to dissuade investors from entering the market
given the yields on other assets.' Mr Hughes adds: 'For a private investor I
don't think it's time to put in a lump sum, but they should keep up regular
savings schemes.'
Is it all doomed to crash, as it did in 1987?
Bullish observers argue that things are very different from 1987, when
markets and economies had been buoyant for several years. Now much of the
world is either emerging, or close to emerging, from recession. 'In 1987,
equity markets got well ahead of bond markets. This rally is more soundly
based,' says Mr Barfield.
What normally upsets markets is something they did not expect - such as
inflation rising.
Kleinwort Benson's Mr Edwards thinks that inflation may eventually revive.
'Governments are very unpopular so they will pursue a low interest rate
policy and they will probably keep the policy up for too long,' he says.
That may lead to renewed inflation in the medium term, he adds, but 'the
problem won't hit equity and bond prices until 18 months from now'.

FT  21 AUG 93 / Local boy can do no wrong: Basques in the home town of VW's
Jose Lopez think he is a hero whether or not they get a car plant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BRUCE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There are about a million square meters of green, wooded hillside just
outside Amorebieta, on the road between Bilbao and Guernica in Spain,
waiting to be flattened and developed. The homesteaders still living on it
were paid for their property by the provincial government two years ago,
when it was thought McDonnell Douglas might build aircraft wings there.
Nothing happened, but for the past year another dream has enveloped the
people of the town. One of their own, studious little Josein who used to
live by the river, had made good and was going to bring a car factory to
town.
The dream originated in the head of Josein - Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de
Arriortua - while he was advancing through the ranks to the top level of
management at General Motors of the US. In March this year, he took it with
him, allegedly together with caseloads of secret GM plans and documents,
when he fled the US group for Volkswagen.
Mr Lopez had worked for 18 months at GM on a project for a revolutionary
plant, in which cars could be built in a fraction of the time taken in
conventional factories. Claiming disillusionment and dismay when he learnt
the US group favoured eastern Europe for any new capacity, he accepted an
oral pledge from Mr Ferdinand Piech, VW chairman, and left for Germany.
Mr Lopez had a hand in preparing the generous terms on which the factory was
to be built by a local consortium and in the leasing deal under which GM,
and later VW, would pay 'rent' according to the number of cars built. The
land was free, and the plant operator would pay no taxes for 12 years.
At one point it seemed as though GM and VW might even fight over the site.
The townsfolk were excited. After all, Josein had flown to Madrid in June to
give a press conference to say it would happen.
Now their champion is in trouble, struggling to survive in a storm of
controversy after a criminal investigation in Germany of alleged industrial
espionage. In Amorebieta they blame GM, which asked for the investigation,
for being a sore loser. But the car plant idea has gone, and now no one
believes it will come. Mr Lopez himself was told recently by Mr Piech that
the German car industry's worst crisis since the war was not the time to be
building new capacity.
By all accounts, young Josein was a quiet, popular boy in the town. His
father worked in a local tool factory and his mother later ran a bar, the
Zuri Beltz (black and white). She still lives above it.
While he was growing up, the Basque Country was brought to its knees by
Franco. He and his friends were careful not to speak their native Basque in
front of strangers.
Nevertheless, Amorebieta grew to become an important metalworking centre.
Its population, just 5,109 in the 1950 census, is now 16,025 'give or take a
dozen', says the clerk at the town hall. The old stone Lopez de Arriortua
home has gone, and the orchard between it and the river has become a car
park and market.
The town, though run by moderate nationalists, is also a significant centre
of support for the Basque separatist terrorist group, Eta. Mr Jon Idigoras,
leader of Herri Batasuna, the political party that supports Eta, drinks
regularly in a local bar. Eta has a different way of looking at the benefits
that business can bring to a town. Its supporters kidnap directors; they are
currently holding one businessman in an effort to raise finance for their
'war' against Madrid. Mr Idigoras says the kidnapping is a private affair
between Eta and the hostage's family.
Even heroes like Mr Lopez step carefully around the extremists of Eta. And
he is a hero. If he was mildly popular as a boy, Josein - whose speech
impediment prompted his nickname of el Tarta from the word for 'to stammer'
 -has now become a legend. Everyone seems to have known him, though the
picture that emerges of him is fuzzy. At a photographic studio, a lady
kindly tore a picture of the house he grew up in from an old album and sold
it to me for Pta500.
'Jose?' asks a group of men in a bar, 'sure we know him.' They say he was a
terrible football player and, although he lived next door to one of the
Basque Country's most famous sportsmen, he never developed much ball sense.
'He was always clumsy, always blinking,' says one. He was apparently never
naughty, and is remembered most for doing his homework and for his enjoyment
of cutting grass with a scythe.
But was Josein just another goody two-shoes or, for a little boy, seriously
obsessed with success? 'I sometimes wonder whether he had a childhood at
all,' says one former friend. 'He never did anything dangerous. We would go
off and steal apples and he would go home and study.'
Superlopez, a fulsome biography just published, says he was reading at two
and was a budding engineer at six. The smartest boy in his class, he spied
on his sister and her suitor (now his brother-in-law), and was ferociously
religious. His close aides today are practising Catholics. He holds to a
rigid diet, never drinks, has never smoked, and had led a sheltered life
before he met his wife at a local hop.
The book, the press coverage, and young Josein's own gift for self-publicity
have worked on the town in subtle ways. People take visiting foreign
correspondents and television cameras in their stride, and the powers of
their hero grow with every telling of his story. No one, for instance,
believes he stole anything from General Motors. 'He would not need to,' says
a man at the bar. 'He carries all he needs to know in his head.'
Perhaps, but will the car plant come?
'No,' cry three impatient people queueing at the town hall as the clerk
answers questions about Mr Lopez for the umpteenth time to a visiting
journalist. 'Not now.'
'I doubt it,' says the man selling copies of the biography at his corner
bookshop.
In a way, it may not matter. Josein could come back here tomorrow and be
taken to its bosom. Locals say he never got too big for his boots so they
would have him back. The Basques would probably make him minister of
industry. He has a nice house on the Guernica road and a boat in Santander.
He has clearly been plotting his way back to Amorebieta ever since he left
in the mid-1960s. There, he can talk in the only language he speaks properly
 -Basque. The car plant was supposed to be his way of coming home.
A guide from the town sweeps a hand over the rolling countryside where the
plant would be built. 'The only people still laughing here are the ones
living on the site,' he says. 'They've already been paid inflated prices and
they're getting to stay on for free.'
It is very beautiful. Even strangers want to stay. The local guide perks up
at the compliment. 'Thank you,' he says. 'It's not so bad. If Josein can't
bring his car factory, we hear they're thinking of building a prison here.'

FT  21 AUG 93 / Letters to the Editor: The incredible cost of corkage
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From The Rr Hon R G WITHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, While in London recently I read an article entitled 'Bring your own
drink' (July 10/11) by Nicholas Lander. I was somewhat surprised to see that
Mr Lander's suggested corkage - if bringing your drink were introduced in
British restaurants - would be a maximum of Pounds 5 for wine and Pounds 10
for champagne.
In the City of Perth, I checked around and over half of our restaurants make
no charge at all, or if they do charge it is either 50 cents or ADollars
1.00 a head.
I wish British drinkers great success in dining out but they should never
pay a corkage of more than 50p a head.

FT  21 AUG 93 / Letters to the Editor: Why is mail order so slow?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JONATHAN PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In 1967 I ordered a pendant from a mail order company in the first of
many hundreds of such purchases over the years. After I sent off my postal
order for 7s 6d, the pendant took four weeks to arrive. I almost despaired
at the delay, but looking back I realise that the order and the accounting
would have been processed entirely manually.
What I cannot understand is that if I were to repeat the exercise today, but
ordering by telephone and using my credit card, the result would be the
same, a wait of four weeks (or longer in some cases).
One would think that the processing of orders could be computerised to allow
a turnaround of less than a week. In fact there is proof that it can: the
Next Directory generally delivers within 48 hours and occasionally within
24. Why are companies still quoting a 28-day service? The good old British
tradition of poor service, one can only assume.

FT  21 AUG 93 / Holy grail still proves elusive: UK retail costs for
wealthier households appear to be rising faster than for poorer families
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Anyone who chose to renew their house insurance, pay their children's school
fees and make a long train journey this week might wonder just how the UK's
annual inflation rate can be as low as 1.4 per cent.
Consumers who paid their gas bill and monthly mortgage and bought a new
washing machine and a pair of jeans would, on the other hand, find
themselves spending considerably less than they did on the same items last
year.
Such vast differences in individual experiences are hardly surprising. The
'retail prices index' is designed to reflect the price of an 'average'
shopping basket. For anyone who is not average, it is a far from perfect
indicator of inflation.
If the information used to compile the index is dissected and put alongside
anecdotal evidence collected by the Financial Times, the signs are that
costs for wealthier households have risen faster than for poorer families.
Figures this week put Britain's annual inflation rate at 1.4 per cent. That
was only slightly higher than June's 30-year low of 1.2 per cent and boosted
government and City hopes that the UK was achieving growth without
inflation. and
But many consumers facing price rises may wonder if the figures reflect
reality. If not, many aspects of everyday life are based on wrong
information. Inflation figures are used as a basis for wage negotiations,
influence companies' pricing decisions, determine how state retirement
pensions and certain social security benefits are upgraded, and set the
levels of interest paid on index-linked National Savings certificates and
indexed gilt-edged stocks.
The retail prices index (RPI) is based on 130,000 prices collected across
the country each month by the Central Statistical Office for 600 goods and
services. Items are weighted according to the proportion of family spending
they represent.
Inevitably the RPI is a compromise. When deciding what weightings to use,
spending patterns of low-income pensioners and households with incomes in
the top 4 per cent - those earning Pounds 925 or more a week - are excluded
on the grounds that they differ significantly from the majority.
'Nobody actually consumes the average basket of goods,' says Mr James Banks,
an economist at the Institute for Fiscal Studies who is researching how
different groups spend their incomes.
'It would be useful to have a series of RPIs for different groups,' he says.
'In the 1970s, for example, increases in food and fuel prices adversely
affected poorer groups, while in the 1980s the bias was against higher
income groups with the prices of luxuries rising and prices of basic goods
falling.'
If such figures were published, they would almost certainly show that many
more households than just those deliberately excluded would find changes in
their own bills out of line with the RPI.
As incomes increase, households spend a higher proportion of their money on
leisure services, such as entertainment and holidays, motoring, alcoholic
drink, and clothing and footwear. The first three categories have risen in
price by more than the overall RPI; the prices of clothing and footwear have
been static.
At the same time, wealthier households spend proportionately less on
housing, fuel, food and tobacco. The prices of housing and fuel have both
fallen over the last year, with only tobacco outstripping the prices index.
So if the RPI were reweighted to reflect the spending patterns of the
better-off, the inflation rate would probably be higher.
Moreover, some costs that fall heavily on wealthier households are not
included in the RPI at all - for instance fees for private education, which
increased by an average of 8.3 per cent this year, according to the
Independent Schools Information Service's annual census.
Another expense of the better-off - the cost of private medical insurance -
is also rising fast, according to Ms Jan Lawson, of Private Health
Partnership, a specialist intermediary. She says medical insurance has risen
by about 17-18 per cent over the last year, largely because of the
increasing use of expensive medical procedures under private cover, and the
general rise in medical costs.
Research by the FT suggests the super-wealthy may have been insulated from
some price rises over the past year, as the recession has forced many
companies offering high price goods or services to keep price rises in
check.
For a 'basket' of luxuries, including a return flight from London to New
York on Concorde, a holiday for two in Grenada, a magnum of vintage
Bollinger champagne, a pair of handmade brogues from Lobb's of St James's
Street, a 'Richmond' hamper from Fortnum and Mason, and a Savile Row suit,
the overall rise was 1.2 per cent - below the RPI. Several prices were
unchanged (see chart).
For the less adventurous consumer, the picture is more mixed. A survey of
prices across retail sectors supports the view that the general level of
increases over the past year has been low, with many prices falling - but
there are important exceptions.
Smokers, for instance, are paying more for cigarettes. The March Budget put
10p on the price of 20 king-size cigarettes. Earlier this month, tobacco
companies raised prices of most leading brands by up to another 4p a pack.
Transport costs have risen considerably. InterCity and Network SouthEast
increased season ticket rates by up to 9.5 per cent this year. A typical
InterCity first-class return fare has risen by about 6 per cent.
But some of the biggest increases have been in insurance premiums. General
Accident said its comprehensive motor insurance had risen 4 per cent and
non-comprehensive policies by 30 per cent, reflecting the increase in theft.
Households are also paying the cost of rising crime. The Consumers
Association said that, across large UK insurers, household contents premiums
had risen by 10-15 per cent, again reflecting rising theft and the growing
incidence of fraudulent claims.
Holidays, which have been included in the RPI only since February this year,
are more expensive. According to Thomson, the tour operator, package holiday
prices are set to tumble next year, but short-haul packages are still more
costly this year than last.
A family of four travelling in high season to Majorca, on 14 nights'
half-board, would pay Pounds 2,148 - 3.6 per cent more than in 1992.
But the reason why the official measure of inflation shows a low rate of
price increases is largely because many households have been helped by the
steep fall in the cost of a mortgage. The standard variable mortgage rate in
July last year was 10.65 per cent; it is now 7.99 per cent.
According to the Halifax building society, the average mortgage is Pounds
50,000. A 30-year-old non-smoking man with an endowment mortgage will have
seen his monthly payments drop from Pounds 448 to Pounds 354 - a 21 per cent
reduction. The underlying annual inflation rate, which excludes mortgages,
was 2.9 per cent in July.
In addition, heating and lighting costs have dropped. British Gas has been
forced to cut domestic prices by a tough formula set by its regulator,
restricting price rises to five percentage points below the RPI.
Household electricity prices have fallen by an average of more than 2 per
cent since April, mainly owing to lower coal prices, although price changes
have varied by area.
Consumers are also paying less - or only a little more - for clothing and
footwear, household and leisure goods.
Competition among store chains has been intense, with high levels of
promotional and discounting activity trying to tempt recession-weary
consumers to part with their cash.
For Levis 501 jeans, for example, monitoring by Verdict, the retail market
research group, found prices at four national chains had not changed over
the past year. But one store chain had lowered its price by Pounds 5,
reducing the average from Pounds 40.32 to Pounds 39.49.
Marks and Spencer, the UK's largest clothing retailer, launched an
'outstanding value' promotion last autumn, cutting the prices of a quarter
of its clothing and freezing the price for the rest.
Argos, the catalogue retailer whose products range from jewellery and
household goods to furniture and sports equipment, said that 75 per cent of
items carried over from its spring/summer catalogue to its recently launched
autumn/winter catalogue were at the same price.
Prices for electrical goods have also come down. GfK Marketing Services,
which supplies pricing information to national chains, said average costs of
both brown goods such as televisions and hi-fi, and white goods such as
fridges, had fallen over the past year.
Food price inflation has been kept low by a combination of increasing price
competition, fostered partly by the rapid spread of discount chains that
sell a limited range of goods at very low prices, and other factors.
Many fresh food prices have been falling this year, with several important
commodity markets moving into surplus at the same time, and plentiful
production of seasonal produce such as salad stuffs and vegetables.
The many pressures on prices highlight the difficulties in predicting where
inflation will go next. While mortgage rates are expected to remain low,
fuel costs will rise next April by 8 per cent with the first stage of the
imposition of VAT. Seasonal factors that have kept food prices down cannot
last.
GfK Marketing Services said it was seeing evidence of prices for electrical
and leisure goods levelling off as summer promotions came to an end.
Vauxhall announced yesterday that it was putting up the price of its cars by
an average of 2.1 per cent from Wednesday.
So it may be too early to assume the UK has reached the 'holy grail' of
growth without inflation. Consumers who have been hit by the biggest prices
rises might believe it is not even on the horizon.

FT  21 AUG 93 / Man in the News: A meter man at heart - Cedric Brown
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is not hard to imagine Mr Cedric Brown, chief executive of British Gas,
turning up to read the meter. Mr Brown has never lost the bluff, genial
manner he developed running one of British Gas's regional offices, where he
was pitched into the middle of the company's battle to please its customers.
Mr Brown's matter-of-fact style has won him praise at the helm of Europe's
14th-largest company, by market capitalisation. Employees are warming to his
increasing openness. He will need all the communication skills he can muster
in coming months when British Gas faces crucial negotiations with the
government over its structure.
The company must soon begin discussions over this week's recommendations by
the Monopolies and Mergers Commission that it sell off its trading
activities and relinquish its monopoly over household supply. The
commission's report leaves a question-mark hanging over the company, which
Mr Brown is keen to remove.
The doubts are largely of Mr Brown's own making. It was at his insistence a
year ago - the day before he took over as chief executive  - that British
Gas submitted itself to an investigation of its entire business by the
commission. His move was unprecedented in UK corporate history and the
biggest gamble of his career. It could have led to the break-up of the
company without compensation for shareholders.
This week Mr Brown said his gamble had paid off. He disagrees with the
commission's conclusion that British Gas must be split up to encourage
competition, but admits that its suggestions at least mean customers will
pay for the changes, rather than shareholders. 'We have by no means got
everything we wanted out of this inquiry. I don't think anyone has, but that
probably means the MMC got it just about right.'
What pleases Mr Brown most about the commission's report is that it lays out
a framework for the industry over the next 10 years. 'This time last year,
we had no idea of the regulatory demands that would come up in six months.'
Uncertainty over regulatory changes in the run-up to the inquiry was partly
a result of the acrimonious relationship between British Gas and its
regulator, Ofgas, headed by the acerbic Sir James McKinnon. Contacts between
the two had deteriorated to such an extent that they could barely work
together.
One of Sir James's chief complaints about the company has been that it often
thinks and acts like a nationalised monopoly in spite of seven years in the
private sector. Sir James conjured up the picture of a company fighting
tooth and nail to preserve the status quo, determined to hang on to its
monopoly, rather than embrace competition.
British Gas hoped to address those concerns, albeit rather belatedly, last
year with the promotion of the 58-year-old Mr Brown.
Mr Brown likes to think of himself as one of British Gas's risk-takers. The
Yorkshireman caught the attention of the board of directors when he
completed the Pounds 1.5bn Morecambe Bay development in the North Sea 13
years ago - British Gas's first venture into such a large offshore gas
development.
Now he says he wants to take 'a can-opener' to the utility he has inherited
and release some of the latent potential buried within. 'I'm aware British
Gas has been accused of being bureaucratic, arrogant, slow-moving, reluctant
to change. I think those comments do have a ring of truth to them and I want
to change that.'
This is partly why Mr Brown is relaxed about giving up the company's
monopoly. In a free market, where consumers have a choice of supplier, the
role of the regulator would be diminished since no single company would
dominate supply. This would give Mr Brown a free hand to develop British Gas
without constant interference.
But having spent his 30-year career almost exclusively at British Gas, Mr
Brown is a recent convert to the free market. He says he saw the light about
halfway through the commission's inquiry at a hearing of British Gas's
evidence by the monopolies panel.
'The MMC had raised a whole series of questions about the monopoly and we
were stressing our concerns about what would happen if the market were
opened up. It suddenly hit me that what we were saying sounded defensive,'
Mr Brown says. He adds that he then made clear to the panel that he did not
want to defend the monopoly for its own sake.
But he stresses that there are important issues such as safety and prices to
be addressed before the market can be opened up.
Cynics could infer from Mr Brown's change of heart that he realised he was
swimming against the tide of a determinedly pro-choice government. 'British
Gas was slow to recognise the changes required in its attitude to
competition,' says one industry observer.
Mr Brown's conversion to the free market has not come lightly. 'It would be
dishonest to say this has been easy,' Mr Brown confesses. 'I take great
pride in British Gas's achievements in creating the market for gas in the UK
over the past 25 years.'
But at least this way, by agreeing to give up the monopoly, Mr Brown can
wrest some benefits for shareholders and safeguards for his customers in a
market free-for-all - even if the government does not implement all the
commission's recommendations.
He wants to concentrate on turning British Gas into an entrepreneurial
organisation. some Over the next couple of years he intends, first, to
develop a strategy for the company and then to begin a programme of cultural
change. In this, he will be assisted by a new chairman, after Mr Robert
Evans retires next year.
Some observers remain sceptical about Mr Brown's long-term strategic vision.
He is best known for his skills as a facilitator, rather than as a thinker.
But he is creating a climate at British Gas in which young talent can
flourish - unlike the atmosphere he grew up with. Shaking off that stifling
atmosphere, Mr Brown is reinventing himself as a free marketeer with a
can-opener.

FT  21 AUG 93 / Leading Article: Markets rule, OK, for now
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
WHILE WORLD stock markets have bubbled merrily this week, brokers have been
looking for historical yardsticks against which to measure the valuation of
equities. For what it is worth, history seems to suggest that prices are
higher, in relation to earnings, than they were at comparable stages after
the recessions of the mid-1970s and early 1980s. But in reality the
yardsticks are distorted. These earlier recessions were about a combination
of stagnation and inflation. The present stock market surge has everything
to do with disinflation and falling interest rates. All instinct suggests
that the markets will become still more overvalued by historic standards
before they run into a correction.
This assertion is based on the working assumption that the downward trend in
interest rates has further to go, at least in Europe, and that the penalty
for holding cash in a low interest rate environment will continue to
encourage people to divert savings into equity markets. But can the present
level of markets be justified on a longer-term view of economic prospects?
The trouble here is that conflicting signals are emerging from the bond and
equity markets. Traditionally, rising bond prices signal expectations of
deflation, while rising equity prices anticipate economic growth. Yet bonds
and equities have been rising together in recent months. The implication
might be that, while equities are behaving in orthodox fashion at the start
of an economic upturn, fixed-interest bonds are going through a sea-change
in the basis of valuation.
Long bond yields in Britain, the US, France and Germany are all in a narrow
6-7 1/2 per cent band, which suggests a remarkably uniform and sanguine view
of inflation. The message is that investors believe that the world is
heading for a period of sustained, non-inflationary growth. What is more,
the market prophecy is partly self-fulfilling.
Power shift
Consider the inflationary side of the equation. After a decade in which
ideologically inclined governments have removed one constraint on markets
after another, political and economic power has shifted between different
groups within society. The retreat from the commitment to full employment,
together with the political assault on trade unions, has undermined the
power of organised labour to the point where wage inflation has virtually
ceased to exist in the tradeable goods sectors of most developed world
economies.
At the same time the ability of governments to monetise debt - in the
vernacular, to print money - has been eroded by the liberalisation of global
markets. If the threat of default by inflation looks remotely real,
currencies weaken, bond prices fall and the cost of government financing
goes up.
This pre-emptive shock treatment does not mean that governments will cease
in future to inflate their way out of trouble. But because the deterrent
exists, it imposes a starker choice on politicians between the current low
inflation and the very high inflation that would result if the markets
shunned public sector IOUs, so forcing governments to turn to the banking
system for inflationary financing. The point is that the policing activity
of the bond markets tends to eliminate the inflationary middle ground.
Not infallible
As for growth, the markets' ability to impose their will on economic
policymakers was once again in evidence this week. The pressure of a soaring
yen, which was temporarily reined in after intervention by the US Fed on
Thursday, has forced the ruling Japanese coalition to contemplate further
fiscal loosening. It is also embracing structural reforms to ensure that the
ill-used Japanese consumer derives some benefit from the falling cost of
imports. This case of market-induced growthmanship follows the earlier
assault on France's franc fort policy, which opened the way to lower
interest rates and reflation in continental Europe.
The snag in all this is that markets are not infallible. If, for example,
the world is moving towards an economic boom based on rapid
industrialisation in China and other parts of Asia, commodity price
inflation could easily return. Union power is invariably weak in a
recession; in an economic recovery it may emerge that the strength of
organised labour has been underestimated. The markets' judgment about the
pressure on public finances and the readiness of individual countries to
default on their debts through inflation may prove over-optimistic.
The markets are unquestionably right in their judgment that liberalisation
has changed the rules of the economic game. But what has not changed is the
age-old truth that interest rates can go up, as well as down. Until there
are more tangible signs that monetary policy is tightening, or alternatively
that governments are failing to validate market assumptions about looser
policy by cutting interest rates, the stock market party still has some zest
in it. The risks may be high, but the cash alternative looks unpalatable.

FT  21 AUG 93 / Vauxhall lifts prices by 2.1%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VAUXHALL is to raise the prices of its cars and light commercial vehicles by
an average 2.1 per cent from Wednesday.
This is Vauxhall's second price increase this year. It raised prices by an
average 2.9 per cent in March.
Ford said yesterday that it intended to delay price rises it announced in
July until the beginning of next month. The new-car market leader is to
raise prices by an average of 2.5 per cent. The increases were due to take
effect from the beginning of this week.
The price increases will apply to 1994 model-year cars with changed
specifications, which will be in showrooms from next month.
The biggest change will be the fitting of an airbag on the driver's side as
standard equipment across the Ford range. Airbags will be fitted to all
Granada, Mondeo and Escort/Orion models from September. Airbags for the
Fiesta small car will follow soon, while passenger-side airbags will be
optional.

FT  21 AUG 93 / Travelling the electronic highway: A Herefordshire town is
moving closer to becoming a fully fledged telecentre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
KINGTON IS wiring up. The small town in Hereford and Worcester is becoming
an electronic community under a national pilot scheme to study the impact of
new technology on rural areas.
The computers and equipment arrived quickly in the town, following its
announcement 10 weeks ago that it had secured the scheme.
Number Two High Street already has nearly a mile of cable in it. The
bow-fronted Georgian building is turning into a telecentre as the focal
point of the Kington Connected Community Project.
The town's businesses, schools, clubs and tourist information offices are
being offered equipment to link them to a local telecommunications network,
which in turn is linked to a British Telecommunications service to give them
enhanced capacity.
The project is being sponsored by government and the private sector.
Public-sector backers include the Rural Development Commission, the
Department of Trade and Industry, while Apple Computer and BT are providing
equipment and cash. They are interested in why the countryside has been
slower to grasp the possibilities of the computer than cities.
The main steps taken so far have been on the communications side. Sooner
than BT had originally planned, Kington is joining the Integrated Services
Digital Network or ISDN, a system of telecommunications which can transmit
almost instantaneously anything which can go down a line - text, data, voice
or image.
Mr David Haskins, of BT's group products and services management division,
says: 'Kington was due for exchange upgrading in 1994. It's been brought
forward a year. ISDN will be available after the upgrading. Normally it
comes on demand - you need a minimum of five heavy-duty customers.'
There will be 15 lines running into the town - 'an electronic highway into
Kington', as Mr Miles Swinburne, the local project manager, puts it. 'We
have had to get the telecoms in before we can exploit the computers,' he
adds.
But these 15 lines will not run to individual BT subscribers. Rather they
will run through a central box which can switch the ISDN connections around
the community as they are needed - hence the small number of lines. ISDN can
be received by BT customers on their existing cable connections.
Ascom, the Swiss-owned group, is providing its Ascotel machines for this
purpose. Its motive for coming to Kington is that, having recently received
the technical approvals for the use of its machines, it wants the machines
to be seen at work. Number Two High Street and the planned training centre
at Lady Hawkins secondary school are the shop windows.
Number Two High Street is alive with plasterers, carpenters and
electricians, decorating, cabling and installing under the supervision of
Systems Support Networking, a Cambridge company which has volunteered to
help. The shop is the obvious link between the connected community project
and the public. The conversion is attracting the curious, for which the
project organisers are thankful.
Interest in a new electronic future for Kington is building up, but is not
yet overwhelming. The attendance at the meeting to elect a board for the the
company set up to run the project was 80, from a population of more than
2,000. But while there has been little local publicity about the training
possibilities, there is nonetheless a steady demand for training.
Rothwell Group, the Apple agent which is supplying the computers, has had
half-a-dozen of the first potential users, including a shopkeeper and
hotelier, along for a one-day introduction.
Each of these people will probably have the loan of one of the 30 computers
Rothwell has provided.
For a community which has seen its traditional farming base eroded, the
introduction of the technology should help protect existing community
activities and attract new businesses to the area - and convince them that
Kington is not as remote as they might think.

FT  21 AUG 93 / Revenue reviews tax on derivatives
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE INLAND Revenue yesterday published draft legislation which will
rationalise the complex and unequal tax treatment of financial instruments
used by UK companies for managing interest rate and currency risk.
Ms Emma Lubbock, head of capital markets at accountants Price Waterhouse,
said: 'These changes will help to bring our Victorian tax legislation into
the twentieth century.'
Because the market in derivative instruments such as swaps and options has
developed rapidly, mainly in the last 10 years, legislation in a number of
areas has not kept pace.
Under the new system, based on an Inland Revenue consultative document
published in August 1991, all profits and losses on a range of instruments
used for managing risk would be taxed as income. Currently, some instruments
are not eligible for tax relief, while others may be subject to income or
capital gains tax.
The Inland Revenue said in a statement: 'The proposals will replace the
current complex rules with a simple and coherent regime for taxing the
profits and losses associated with these instruments.
'This will provide companies with certainty and clarity in this difficult
area of tax law.'
The move was widely welcomed by UK company treasurers. While large companies
can generally manoeuvre around the tax hurdles, the complexity of the system
has discouraged some smaller companies from using derivative instruments to
manage risk.
Mr Arthur Burgess, treasurer of British Gas, said: 'In common with every
major user we have used Dutch companies (as a vehicle) for capital markets
instruments, not to avoid UK tax, but to gain certainty of tax treatment.'
He said that corporate treasurers wanted 'symmetry of treatment' of gains
and losses.
The Inland Revenue is inviting representations on the draft legislation by
October 31. The legislation will come into force at the same time as new
foreign exchange rules, which are included in the 1993 Finance Act.

FT  21 AUG 93 / RiverBus closes with 60 job losses
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE OPERATORS of London's RiverBus yesterday decided to close the service
after a 15-month struggle since the financial collapse of its principal
underwriter Olympia &amp; York, the Canary Wharf developer.
After five years of operation on the Thames between Chelsea, the City,
Docklands and Greenwich, the last service ran last night. All 60 staff are
to be made redundant.
The RiverBus partnership said it had decided at a meeting yesterday that
there was no possibility of being able to raise further funds from any
sources to pay for future operation. It said it had no outstanding debts.
It said RiverBus would pass into the hands of liquidators, who would try to
sell it.
The number of passengers was growing - 750,000 used the fleet of 10
high-speed ferries last year - but there would never be enough to break
even, the partnership said.
A long-term future would only have been assured by an injection of public
cash. The government's sole contribution had been Pounds 500,000 from the
Department of Environment four years ago.
It said: 'Public transport in London does not make a profit. We had huge
capital overheads, a fleet of boats, crew. The loss to us is nowhere near as
much as the loss to London.'
RiverBus was launched in June 1988 after 1,700 investors raised Pounds 4.5m
to start it under the Business Expansion Scheme. But it did not attract
commuters in the numbers it hoped for and had to be rescued in February 1989
by a group of property developers from Docklands and Chelsea, including O&amp;Y,
Rosehaugh Stanhope and Chelsea Harbour, which put up Pounds 2.5m. The
government contributed Pounds 500,000.
The Port of London Authority said it would approach pleasure boat operators
licensed to use its piers about setting up RiverBus-type passenger services.

FT  21 AUG 93 / Homes Assured directors 'were fully in the picture'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DIRECTORS of Homes Assured, the mortgage broker that collapsed in 1989,
were fully aware of the company's financial difficulties nine months before
it collapsed, a jury at Chichester Rents in London heard yesterday.
In his summing up Judge John Rogers QC recalled a letter from the Royal Bank
of Scotland in November 1988 expressing 'extreme concern' about the accounts
of Homes Assured Midlands. It listed 440 cheques that had bounced in the
previous two months and said: 'We can tolerate this situation no longer.'
There were also substantial sums owing to the Inland Revenue on behalf of
Homes Assured customers. 'You must ask yourselves whether it was right for
the management to run a company incurring debts with money they know is not
their own,' the judge said.
He cited comments from Mr Douglas Dunkley, an accountant at Homes Assured,
who said in November 1988 that he had been 'worried for some time about the
unreal optimism in the company'.
The judge said: 'In retrospect, Mr Dunkley was dead right. All those
involved in the day-to-day running of the company were put fully in the
picture by a man whose accounting skills have never been called into
question.'
The judge reminded the jury of a letter from Stoy Hayward, Homes Assured
auditor, in November 1988 warning of 'major cash difficulties' and reminding
the directors of their responsibilities.
He added: 'One wonders whether (the directors) were wanting to receive the
message that was quite clearly being spelt out to them.'
He also mentioned a report commissioned by Commercial Union from accountants
Coopers &amp; Lybrand in March 1989 showing current liabilities of Pounds 6.25m
in December 1988.
'It seems that the warnings were coming thick and fast from every possible
direction,' he told the jury.
He stressed that the defendants - none of whom gave evidence - argued that
they believed money to allow the company to continue to trade would be
forthcoming. Once they realised salvation would not be possible - in August
1989 - they ceased trading.
Mr Anthony Dobson, Mr Keith Woodward and Mr Michael Robinson all deny a
joint charge of fraudulent trading from November 1988 to August 1989.
Mr Dobson also denies two charges of procuring the execution of a valuable
security by deception and Mr Woodward one of furnishing false information.
The judge will conclude his summing up on Monday.

FT  21 AUG 93 / Trade deficit with non-EC countries widens
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S visible trade gap with non-European Community countries widened in
July as a fall in exports and a sharp increase in imports brought four
months of improvement to an end.
The Central Statistical Office reported yesterday that the deficit, which
reflects just under half of UK trade, increased to a seasonally adjusted
Pounds 778m last month from June's revised total of Pounds 599m.
Imports rose by 2.4 per cent to Pounds 5.57bn between June and July while
exports, which had increased sharply by 4.4 per cent between May and June,
reversed part of that gain, falling 1 per cent to Pounds 4.79bn last month.
Excluding oil and so-called erratic items, exports and imports hit records
in value terms last month of Pounds 4.13bn and Pounds 4.84bn respectively.
This may have partly reflected a sharp rise in the import and export prices
of non-oil products in July.
The visible trade gap was slightly worse than the Pounds 700m deficit
foreshadowed in recent consensus forecasts from City analysts. But it had
little effect on either sterling or the market for government gilt-edged
securities yesterday.
The City has been forecasting for some time that Britain's overall current
account deficit for this year will be less than the Pounds 17.5bn forecast
by the government in its March Budget. Yesterday's figures did not upset
these expectations.
The CSO said the figures indicated a flattening of the upward trend of the
visible balance, although its latest estimates of the trend of non-EC trade
show a rise of 0.5 per cent a month for exports with no change in imports.
The Treasury said the underlying trend in trade was still favourable. It
pointed out that in volume terms exports, excluding oil and erratics, were
2.5 per cent higher in the three months to July compared with the preceding
three months and were growing at a faster pace than imports.
CSO figures showed that volume imports, less oil and erratics, increased
only 0.5 per cent in the latest three months compared with the February to
April period. But last month's import volume, excluding oil and erratics,
was a record.
Yesterday's report showed that Britain was in deficit with the non-EC
countries in all broad commodity categories last month. Trade in
semi-manufactures showed a seasonally adjusted deficit (of Pounds 110m) for
the first time this year.
However, trade in finished manufactures has moved closer to balance in
recent months with deficits of Pounds 284m in July and Pounds 250m in June.
Britain's trade with North America was in the black for the fourth
successive month, showing a small surplus of Pounds 65m in July. The UK also
maintained its traditional surplus with the oil-exporting countries last
month but ran deficits with other regions.
The Confederation of British Industry said that yesterday's news on exports
remained encouraging. But it noted that 'the majority of the UK's trade is
with countries inside the EC and CBI surveys have suggested that weak
European markets could be holding back overall export growth'.
Figures for trade with the EC are not yet available on a monthly basis
following the completion of the single market at the end of last year.
Second-quarter trade figures covering the EC will be released on September
10.

FT  21 AUG 93 / Bidders 'rigged PSA contracts'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GROUNDS maintenance companies have been rigging prices on government
contracts worth Pounds 10m a year, the Office of Fair Trading, the
public-spending watchdog, said yesterday.
Sir Bryan Carsberg, OFT director-general, accused the companies of operating
an 'unlawful' secret price-rigging and market-sharing agreement, and said he
would refer it to the Restrictive Practices Court.
The court has the power to ban any such agreement if it decides that it
operates against the public interest.
The OFT said the price rigging had been taking place 'since at least 1976'
and involved 11 companies.
It related to contracts granted by the Property Services Agency, the manager
of central government property, for the maintenance of military bases and
other government properties. The PSA alerted the OFT to the possible
existence of the covert agreement in a 1990 report on investigations of
tendering patterns.
Sir Bryan said: 'Collusion and lack of competition between tenderers
inevitably lead to higher prices and poorer services.'
The OFT said the companies seemed to have been engaging in two kinds of
restrictive practices. There was an agreement between 11 of them that if one
wanted to keep a contract, the others would submit higher bids when the
contract was put out to tender.
A sub-group of four companies were said by the OFT to have agreed not to
submit any bids if a contract held by one of them, which it wanted to
retain, was put out to tender.
Mr Ian Mitchell, chairman of Mitchell and Struthers, one of the companies
accused by the OFT, said: 'I would certainly say there is no agreement as
far as we are concerned.'
Mr Peter Wilson, a director of JV Strong, another accused company, said: 'We
are happy to confirm that the practices referred to by the OFT have not been
operated by existing management and won't be in future.'
The other companies accused are G Burley and Sons, Basil H Childe, Cliff
Evans (Knockin), R Hewision and Sons, Landscape Maintenance, Tonrin
Contractors, Turfsoil, Tyler Environmental Services, and Welbourn
Sportsgrounds.

FT  21 AUG 93 / Vauxhall to lift prices by 2.1%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VAUXHALL is to raise the prices of its cars and light commercial vehicles by
an average 2.1 per cent from Wednesday.
This is Vauxhall's second price increase this year. It raised prices by an
average 2.9 per cent in March.
The latest move to raise prices follows the announcement in July by Ford,
the UK new-car market leader, that it intended to raise prices by an average
2.5 per cent from the beginning of this week.
Ford said yesterday that it had delayed this increase by two weeks and it
would take effect from the beginning of next month.
The price increases will apply to 1994 model-year cars with changed
specifications, which will be in showrooms from next month.
The biggest change will be the fitting of an airbag on the driver's side as
standard equipment across the Ford range. Airbags will be fitted to all
Granada, Mondeo and Escort/Orion models from September. Airbags for the
Fiesta small car will follow a couple of months later.
Passenger-side airbags will be optional. Ford is the first volume carmaker
in Europe to offer driver-side airbags as standard across its range.
Car price movements have been complicated in the last year with prices being
lowered as a result of the removal of special car tax last November.
Several manufacturers have been reducing list prices, but at the same time
have cut margins to their dealers. This has in effect reduced the scope for
discounting and has often left transaction prices little changed.
Carmakers have also raised prices to reflect factors such as the devaluation
of sterling, improved equipment and the need to restore profit margins,
which have suffered in the recession.

FT  21 AUG 93 / Merrett bows to Lloyd's pressure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE OF the leading underwriting managers at Lloyd's of London yesterday
bowed to pressure for changes from seven of the most powerful managing
agents in the insurance market.
Merrett Underwriting Agency Management (MUAM) agreed to replace Mr Stephen
Merrett as chairman and appoint two new non-executive directors.
The action follows an unusual campaign by an ad hoc group of members' agents
in the last few weeks. They threatened to withdraw business from MUAM unless
certain demands were met. These included the appointment of a senior
executive to strengthen management and disclosure of Mr Merrett's interest
in the company.
Mr Merrett said the concerns focused on criticism of his personality. 'I
would not suggest any criticisms of me have been unfair,' he said.
The members' agents were Sedgwick, Anton, London Wall, Sturge, Murray
Lawrence, Wellington and Willis Faber. They wrote to MUAM in July and
triggered a series of meetings and letters.
A letter from Mr Dennis Purkiss, MUAM's deputy chairman, circulated to the
group yesterday set out its response. The company is to appoint a new
chairman by the middle of October, who is likely to be a non-executive, and
the board has already decided to appoint its first two non-executive
directors. The letter showed that Mr Merrett held three of the 25 MUAM 'A'
voting shares.
Mr Merrett said: 'Pressure from the group coincided with our own concerns.
We thought there was very little in the points they were making. It looks as
though we have met them.'

FT  21 AUG 93 / Portillo seeks to calm rightwing fears on tax
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT yesterday sought to head off a rightwing rebellion over
taxation by promising big cuts in public spending to offset rising social
security costs.
However, Mr Michael Portillo, chief secretary to the treasury, refused to
bow to pressure from the Thatcherite Conservative Way Forward Group and rule
out tax increases in the November Budget.
Way Forward, which is supported by several cabinet ministers, warned on
Thursday that tax increases 'will not be accepted unless a sharp pruning
knife is taken to public spending first'. The warning coincided with a
vitriolic attack on Mr John Major's 'disunited' government by Lord
Parkinson, chairman of Way Forward, and a former Conservative party
chairman.
Mr John Townend, chairman of the Conservative backbench finance committee,
put further pressure on the government yesterday by warning that tax
increases could cost the party the next general election.
'If we do not tackle public expenditure, and we go into the next election as
the party that has increased taxation, we don't stand a hope in hell of
winning,' he said.
Mr Portillo played down the Way Forward comments, which he described as
'lobbying in very colourful language to make sure the government maintains
its toughness'.
He urged the right not to underestimate the difficulty the government would
face in sticking to its commitment to hold public spending steady in real
terms. The government would have to take 'difficult' action to constrain the
rising social security budget and identify other spending cuts.
He added that cuts might be bigger than expected if the pace of economic
recovery faltered in the next few months.
He conceded that 'we may have to have some tax increases', adding to
speculation that Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, is preparing to widen
the VAT net.

FT  21 AUG 93 / Gould attacks Labour strategy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR'S decision to abandon redistributionist economic policies spells the
end of its hopes of winning a general election, Mr Bryan Gould said
yesterday.
Mr Gould, who resigned from the shadow cabinet last autumn, said the
strategy revealed the party leadership's 'worrying' lack of ambition. His
comments reflect continuing unease on the left of the party about the
pro-Europe and anti-taxation policies being developed by party
'modernisers'.
Much of Mr Gould's criticism was aimed at a revised economic strategy
released earlier this week by Mr Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor, which
abandons the 'tax and spend' manifesto on which the party fought the 1992
general election.
In a deliberate effort to improve the party's image, particularly in the
south of England, Mr Brown said Labour would no longer seek to 'penalise'
wealth and promised tax cuts if possible.
Writing in Tribune, the leftwing newspaper, Mr Gould said the revised
strategy might consolidate Labour support in the party's heartlands but
would do nothing to win votes in the south. 'Standing by while the Liberal
Democrats reap the benefits of Tory unpopularity in the south makes sense
only if we have resigned ourselves to sharing power with them after the next
election,' he said.
'If that is what now passes for strategic thinking, then the party should at
least be let in on the secret. Such a strategy would be self-defeating, and
would represent a complete misreading of the public mood.'
He said the collapse of the exchange rate mechanism gave Labour a chance to
'break with Euro-monetarism and the defeatist view that we can't run the
economy ourselves'.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
TRAVELLERS WHO buy goods in another EC country but return to the UK through
a non-EC state will no longer be forced to pay duty twice, Customs said
yesterday.
Anyone who can produce evidence that goods imported to the UK were bought in
another EC country for personal use with duty and tax paid will not be
required to pay again.
Since the lifting of border controls with the creation of the single
European market at the start of the year, some travellers have been caught
by the requirement to pay duty on all imports to the UK from a non-EC state.
The travellers most affected have been those on yachts sailing to the UK
from France via the Channel Islands, which are not part of the EC. Others
affected included travellers from airports in Switzerland and Scandinavia.

THE DISCOUNTING war in the 1994 summer package holiday market intensified
yesterday as Airtours, the UK's third biggest travel group, said it would
offer 100,000 children-go-free places to young people up to 19 following
similar moves by its larger rivals Thomas Cook and Thomson, Gary Mead
writes.
The Manchester-based group added that the cost of a two-week holiday on
Spain's Costa Brava for two adults and two children would be Pounds 491 for
the whole family.
The move was followed by Cosmos, another large UK tour operator, which said
it would offer free places for 50,000 young people accompanied by their
parents at nearly 300 hotels and apartments in 29 destinations, including
Florida.

FT  21 AUG 93 / Graduates 'lack Euro job skills'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE number of UK university graduates finding work in continental Europe
remains minimal, the Institute of Manpower Studies, said yesterday.
Its report damps speculation that a continental European labour market may
be developing.
Only 1.4 per cent of graduates with higher degrees find work on the
continent, while the figure for students with a first degree is 1.7 per
cent. But half the first-degree graduates went into teaching posts, rather
than business positions.
The increase in recruitment is minimal - 1,266 UK graduates worked in
continental Europe in 1991 compared with 1,200 the previous year.
Poor language skills were identified as one of the main barriers to finding
jobs abroad. They also found that UK graduates lacked the relevant
qualifications to satisfy European employers.
Students also suffered from relative youth and inexperience compared with
European counterparts, and had great difficulty finding out about employment
opportunities.
France was the most popular destination - possibly because French is the
most widely taught language in British schools - and accounted for 39 per
cent of all graduates. It was followed by Germany (20 per cent), Belgium (15
per cent), the Netherlands (12 per cent) and Spain (8 per cent).
For higher-degree graduates, Germany was the most popular destination.
Continental European companies appeared to be highly selective - most of the
105 employers identified as being interested in UK graduates seemed to be
targeting individual institutions, and in some cases specific departments.
Their links with 'new' universities - the former polytechnics - and with
higher education colleges are weaker than those with the old universities.
The flow of UK graduates is expected to increase steadily, but not
dramatically.

FT  21 AUG 93 / Estate agents turn a profit on property-chain deals: A look
at surveyors' success in riding the housing cycle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THIS WEEK marked a turning point in the British high street. The traditional
estate agent is making a comeback.
Six years after many chartered surveyors sold businesses to mortgage lenders
and life assurance companies, they are buying them back at a fraction of
those inflated prices.
The two biggest winners of the economic cycle in housing emerged this week
when Mr Bill McClintock and Mr Tony Snarey bought the 347-branch Cornerstone
chain for Pounds 8m from Abbey National, the bank. That is a tenth of the
price per branch that Royal Life paid for Mr Snarey's previous chain in
1986.
There is more to come. Bristol &amp; West, the building society, is trying to
sell 147 branches and is finding the only buyers in the market are the
chartered surveyors who sold at the top of the cycle. Like the new owners of
Cornerstone, many are seeking financial backing from life insurers in return
for product ties.
Mr McClintock and Mr Snarey epitomise the traditional agents who rely on
working long hours to make the maximum number of sales. Mr Snarey started
his career with Harrods 35 years ago before joining the William H Brown
chain in the 1960s, helping build it to 250 offices.
Although Cornerstone lost Pounds 2m in the first half of this year, Mr
Snarey thinks a spot of traditional management should return it to profit.
He said: 'The way that estate agents work does not fit too kindly with
corporate ownership. It clashes with the entrepreneurial spirit that they
need.'
After the millions - perhaps more than Pounds 1bn - lost by the corporate
owners of estate agents in the past six years, Mr Snarey's assertion does
not raise too much controversy. Mr Tony FitzSimons, Bristol &amp; West's chief
executive, said that the management methods of building societies were alien
to agencies.
He added: 'The traditional agent makes all his money from sales, from piling
it high and selling it cheap. He will work 14 hours a day and under-price
his own time. A corporation cannot do that.' Mr FitzSimons said that Bristol
&amp; West was negotiating with other chartered surveyors for its own branches.
Mr Snarey said there were more secrets to estate agency than simply working
long hours. One was that it was wrong to impose a single culture.
He added: 'A chain should be a sort of confederation of independent people
who can work together under the same name but use their own styles.'
He insisted that the quality which consumers found irritating - estate
agents' persistence - was the thing which achieved sales. He said: 'You have
to give people their head and let them develop. As soon as people are put in
a bureaucracy and told to report to the centre, they become number counters
and not sellers.'
Mr Snarey and Mr McClintock managed to ride the housing cycle cleverly. They
sold the independent chains in which they were partners amid the hysteria of
corporate buying in the late 1980s. The buyers in that market later found
that they had bought far less than they imagined.
Most estate agency chains amount to little more than a set of shop leases,
and a brand. Abbey National has written off Pounds 141m of accounting
'goodwill' on Cornerstone - the amount it paid on top of the value of the
physical assets. It has lost Pounds 90m in operating Cornerstone over six
years.
Meanwhile, Mr Snarey and Mr McClintock sat out the period of loss-making
corporate ownership of estate agents as the joint chief executives of Royal
Life Estates, the chain that was formed from their two businesses.
With hindsight, perhaps the large corporations should have seen it coming.
If there was one transaction on which an estate agent might have been
expected to turn a profit, it was in selling property. And as they re-emerge
it is logical to believe that the market is turning once more.
Mr Snarey is confident that he and his partner have not paid too much. He
said: 'It may be that we are at the bottom of the cycle now, and we may even
see some upturn.' The years away from his own estate agency have not dimmed
his faith in the value of owning your own property.

FT  21 AUG 93 / TUC split over electricians' return
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UNITY of next month's Trades Union Congress is under threat from the
continuing conflict over the return of the maverick electricians to the TUC
six years after they were expelled.
Intensive negotiations are going on behind the scenes, involving Mr John
Monks, the new TUC general secretary, to resolve the outstanding differences
over the electricians, whose breakaway EETPU union merged with the AEU
engineering union to form the AEEU last year.
Other unions have complained that they lost members to the electricians
through alleged poaching. The situation will be discussed at Monday's
meeting of the TUC finance and general purposes committee. The TUC general
council will have to decide what to do when it meets on Wednesday.
During their years outside the TUC - when they were not bound by the rules
governing inter-union relations - the electricians launched an aggressive
recruitment drive among members of TUC-affiliated unions.
In the past 12 months the TUC has been trying to smooth the return of the
electricians.
Three unions remain dissatisfied - Ucatt, the construction union; the TGWU
general union and the Prison Officers' Association.
Mr George Brumwell, Ucatt general secretary, has complained to the TUC that
poaching is continuing, and he insists that the union must disband its
construction and building trades section.
Mr Gavin Laird, AEEU general secretary, has told the TUC that his union is
not seeking to undermine Ucatt but remains unwilling to disband its
construction section.
Eleven other unions which are involved in disputes with the electricians
appear to have reached an accommodation.
One union official said: 'Union leaders could face two unpalatable options.
They could produce an interim report pointing out further conciliation is
necessary, which would mean the electricians' section could not return to
the TUC until next autumn.
'Alternatively they could call for the suspension of the whole of the AEEU
from the TUC until the differences have been settled.'
Neither option is likely to be acceptable to the TUC, which wants to use the
congress as a new start under a new general secretary looking forward to the
next century.
A public spat over the electricians is a return to a bitter past that many
union leaders would prefer to avoid.
The Scottish TUC is to hold a protest rally in Dundee, Tayside, today over
the bitter dispute at the city's Timex plant which is to close.
A further 100 workers were paid off yesterday at the plant leaving just 100
employees, although Timex said the closure was still 'several weeks away'.
When the closure was announced in mid-June the plant employed 375 people, of
whom 280 had been hired to replace sacked workers.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE INSTITUTE of Directors yesterday called for a national campaign to
encourage more students to take up science studies.
Dr Ann Robinson, head of the IoD's policy unit, said business and the
government should co-operate 'in making maths, technical and scientific
subjects more sexy and exciting for young people'.
This week's A-level results showed falls in the number of students taking
chemistry, physics and biology.
'Unless more schoolchildren and higher-education students are encouraged to
take up these subjects, Britain's competitive position will be seriously
threatened,' said Dr Robinson.

between the German carmaker and General Motors of the US could be resolved
in a less public fashion, Reuter reports from Berlin.
He met Mr Ferdinand Piech, VW chairman, and Mr Klaus Liesen, supervisory
board chairman, for over an hour. He had a similar meeting on Tuesday with
the chairman of GM's German subsidiary, Adam Opel. He will meet them again
next week.
The dispute surrounds the move to VW of GM production chief Jose Ignacio
Lopez de Arriortua, taking several GM managers with him. Opel alleges the
former GM managers took industrial secrets with them.

</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE jet engine division of GE of the US is making 4,000 more workers
redundant, taking the total to 12,000 in the past two years. Declining
demand for civilian and military aircraft is behind the latest cuts, which
echo those made at rival engine-maker Pratt &amp; Whitney, writes Richard Waters
in New York.
Most of the jobs will go by the end of this year, reducing employment in the
GE Aircraft Engines division to 22,000, from 34,000 two years ago. They will
be concentrated among salaried employees rather than hourly-paid workers,
with at least half coming from the division's headquarters in Cincinnati.
Pratt &amp; Whitney said yesterday that it was reviewing its staffing levels 'on
a continuous basis'. Its workforce has fallen from 44,400 at the end of 1991
to 35,000, and will drop to 30,000 by the end of next year. Orders for new
engines remain weak, it said.

for elections rebuffed

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THOUSANDS OF demonstrators, braving wind and rain, carried Russia's battle
between conservatives and reformers on to the streets of Moscow yesterday as
rival political groups held public meetings to commemorate the second
anniversary of the failed hardline coup.
Two years ago, Mr Boris Yeltsin was hailed as a national hero for defying
hardliners from the roof of a tank parked on the steps of the White House,
Russia's parliament building. Yesterday afternoon, more than 6,000
Muscovites gathered on those same steps, chanted that their president was 'a
Judas' and carried bold red banners trumpeting their support for parliament.
Mirroring the stalemate at the apex of Russian politics, a roughly equal
number of Yeltsin backers held a rival rally on the same spot later.
Mr Yeltsin yesterday asked the country's conservative parliament to agree to
early elections as part of his long-running struggle with the legislators.
However, the request was a largely formal gesture which was immediately
shrugged off by parliamentary leaders.
Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, the chairman of parliament and one of the president's
most powerful opponents, said the legislature would not even debate the
president's request.
Although Mr Yeltsin claims to have a 10-week plan to force an autumn vote,
his legal options appear limited. During the April referendum in which
voters endorsed his market reforms, they also rejected the idea of early
parliamentary elections. Russia's constitution also makes no provisions for
premature elections.
Next week, Mr Yeltsin is expected to pursue one of his tactics for
out-manoeuvring the parliament. He has summoned regional leaders to Moscow
on Monday for a meeting of the newly-created Federation Council. Mr Yeltsin
hopes the council will develop into a Russian version of the Bundesrat, the
German upper house which comprises representatives of the country's Lander,
or states.
By expanding the authority of the council, an embryonic organisation
comprising Russia's regional leaders, Mr Yeltsin hopes to dilute
parliament's power.

FT  21 AUG 93 / China aims to stem corruption tide: Campaign launched to
counter threat to Communists' authority
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BEIJING
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CHINA yesterday launched a nationwide campaign to combat corruption which
Communist leaders believe is undermining their authority and threatening
their party's very future.
The party's top watchdog, the central commission for discipline inspection,
began a session in Beijing yesterday at which strong calls were made to rein
in corruption which has been fuelled by the economic boom of the past year.
The drive against corruption, a pervasive force which reaches high into the
party itself, coincides with a general tightening up in China as the
authorities seek to regain control of a runaway economy that grew by nearly
14 per cent in the first six months of this year. The six-day conference in
Beijing, which is due to be addressed by Mr Jiang Zemin, the Communist party
leader, follows the release of a report this week that 'nearly 30,000 party
and government officials have been disciplined in the first half of this
year on charges of malpractice or irregularities'. According to the People's
Daily newspaper, 'the accusations against them have ranged from bribe-taking
to neglect of their duties'.
Mr Jiang, who has struggled to stamp his authority on the party since
becoming general secretary after the Tiananmen massacre of 1989, has made
the anti-corruption fight something of a personal crusade, railing against
the 'exchange of power for money and indulgence in sex and food'.
Mr Wei Jianxing, head of the commission for discipline inspection and a
politburo member, blamed the uncertain transition phase from a centrally
planned economy to a market system for creating opportunities for
corruption. He told more than 100 delegates to the conference: 'As the new
structure has not formed and the legal system is still being perfected,
there are loopholes in policies and management and there isn't a clear line
of demarcation between right and wrong in some issues. This gives
opportunities to violators of law and discipline.'
Mr Wei called for increased vigilance among all Chinese to help in the
campaign to root out corruption, which ranges from official involvement in
smuggling to accepting kickbacks from foreign companies anxious to do
business in China.
Petty corruption is also widespread and is one of the main causes of unrest
in rural areas, where hard-pressed peasant farmers have suffered at the
hands of unscrupulous local officials responsible for levying a host of
taxes and charges.
Mr Wei presented a report to his party colleagues entitled: 'Adapt to the
new circumstances, expand the fight against corruption and strive for the
full implementation of the basic guidelines of the party.'
This is expected to form the basis for a new code of conduct to try to
ensure 'clean government'.

FT  21 AUG 93 / Pakistan set for credit of Dollars 350m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALEXANDER NICOLL, Asia Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PAKISTAN is almost certain to receive a Dollars 350m (Pounds 235m)
short-term credit from the International Monetary Fund to back economic
measures announced by the interim government in Islamabad on Thursday.
The IMF said that on the basis of the government's economic programme, the
fund's management would recommend that its executive board approve a standby
credit at a meeting in mid-September. The short-term financing would later
be replaced by medium-term IMF loans expected to total about Dollars 1bn.
Short-term financial assistance is needed because Pakistan's foreign
exchange reserves fell to a low level during political turmoil which
resulted in the resignation of the president and prime minister last month.
Medium-term funding cannot be agreed until a new government is in place
after elections on October 6.
The IMF said the economic programme announced by Mr Moeen Qureshi, the
former World Bank official who is caretaker prime minister, sought to reduce
domestic financial imbalances and strengthen reserves.
Mr Qureshi, attempting to tackle the chronic budget deficit, introduced a
tax on rich landowners and promised to crack down on tax evasion as well as
inefficiency and corruption in government.
Import tariffs are to be reduced sharply over three years to between 35 and
50 per cent from the current average of 90 per cent.
He took advantage of a lack of political affiliation to take sensitive
decisions which previous governments have been unable or unwilling to
address. Though there will be doubts about the ability of the next
government to carry through Mr Qureshi's programme, the country's economic
situation will put it under pressure to do so. The IMF medium-term money
will also be a powerful incentive.
The Pakistan Moslem League, the party of former prime minister Mr Nawaz
Sharif, said the reforms were an endorsement of its own policies, but
criticised Mr Qureshi for pushing through such important changes as a
caretaker leader.

FT  21 AUG 93 / Nigeria waits for its marching orders: A look at the
momentous decision General Babangida will take next week
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THE COUNTDOWN to a confrontation that could reverberate across Africa is
under way.
By this time next week General Ibrahim Babangida, Nigeria's military leader,
will have made a decision which will shape the future of the continent's
most populous nation and second largest economy.
Will the general buckle under international and domestic pressure, and
honour his promise to hand over to civilians by August 27? Or will he extend
the life of a regime widely viewed as corrupt, incompetent and as unpopular
as any in Nigeria's turbulent history since independence in 1960?
Yesterday, the Nigerian Labour Congress issued a blunt warning: 'If by
August 27 1993 the military does not proclaim the 1989 constitution, hand
over to the senate president, and disengage from governance, workers should
stay at home and dissociate themselves from any unconstitutional government
until further notice.'
Also demanding that he go are a growing number of senior military officers,
two of the country's former military leaders - and an erstwhile friend of
more than 20 years' standing.
'By the grace of God, I will be home on my 56th birthday next Tuesday,' says
Chief Moshood Abiola, the man who is entitled to call himself Nigeria's
president-elect, but who recently fled the country in his private aircraft,
in fear for his life.
Over breakfast in London, the wealthy businessman, winner of the June 12
poll annulled by the general, vowed to return to Lagos, though declining to
comment on suggestions that he intends to be sworn into office on arrival,
in defiance of the regime.
It would be surprising if Mr Abiola's supporters were not out in force.
Nigeria's commercial capital is also the chief's political stronghold, in
the heart of the Yoruba-dominated south-west.
But as Yorubas prepare to rally behind their kinsman, Mr Abiola's Social
Democratic party seems to be losing the broad national support that secured
him his comfortable victory, performing well in the National Republican
Convention's northern base.
As tensions rise, loyalties that go much deeper than those owed to two
artificial parties created by the soldiers seem to be taking hold,
exacerbating old rivalries between the Yoruba Christian south and the
Hausa-Fulani Moslem north.
Fearful of what may be to come, many thousands of Nigerians and their
families are relocating across a country the combined size of France, Italy,
Belgium and the Netherlands, to seek refuge in home regions.
It is the latest chapter in a saga which has taken Nigeria from confident,
if not arrogant, petro-dollar billionaire with aspirations to a seat on the
UN security council, to the brink of disaster.
Over a decade spanning the early 1970s into the early 1980s, some Dollars
100bn (Pounds 67bn) flowed into a country once dependent on cocoa,
groundnuts and palm oil for modest foreign exchange earnings.
In 1980, at the peak of an oil boom that proved a curse and not a blessing,
Nigeria earned Dollars 25bn.
It created a generation of overnight millionaires, who pocketed inflated
commissions and kickbacks. It left a legacy of white elephants that burden
the country to this day. But even more damaging, the abuse and mismanagement
of wealth helped destroy the fabric of Nigerian society.
'It's left the universities without books, the judges without integrity, the
civil servant without honesty,' says a bitter Nigerian in his 30s.
'Our politics have been commercialised, our army has been politicised,' says
a cynical young lawyer.
But the most ominous observation was offered earlier this year in Kaduna,
political heart of the north, by a distinguished civil servant who retired
in the mid-1970s: 'We've lost the old leaders, and the system is too rotten
to train new ones? Where does that leave us?'
Meanwhile, in his fortified presidential palace in the capital, Abuja,
protected by the Brigade of Guards, Gen Babangida prepares his next move. He
is as tough as he is unpredictable, and few Nigerians are sure what that
will be.
Earlier this week, in a speech expected to end the nervous uncertainty and
set out the powers and composition of the new interim civilian
administration, he gave no details. Instead, he seemed to hint that he was
preparing to swap his army uniform for civilian attire and serve Nigeria for
some time to come. 'I shall also be prepared and ready at the end of the
interim government to pass on my experience to the elected president,' he
said.
An announcement is now expected next Wednesday. the day the existing
transitional council is due to hand over to an interim national government,
headed by a civilian. That would hold a fresh presidential election in
October 1994, yielding power to the winner on December 31 next year.
Some army officers - in a minority, say observers - are urging Gen Babangida
to stay. But those who want the 52-year-old general to go will not relish
the prospect of breaking the news to him.

FT  21 AUG 93 / Benefits of strengthened yen yet to reach consumers: Why
people must play the watchdog on stores despite the falling costs of
imported goods
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GORDON CRAMB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S consumers are being urged by their new government to play watchdog
on the stores at which they shop.
They should be enjoying the benefits of a yen which has strengthened against
all leading currencies since the beginning of the year - it has made
importing US goods 16 per cent cheaper, even after Thursday night's US move
to stop the yen breaking Y100 to the dollar.
But in the shops, for the most part they are not. Some of the windfall gains
get snagged in the multiple layers of the country's distribution system,
while the portion which reaches retailers is greeted as manna by store
chains struggling to stay in the black.
However, consumers are now being offered the glimmerings of a better deal.
'We know there are merits as well as demerits in the yen's rise,' says Mr
Masayoshi Takemura, chief spokesman for the seven-party coalition sworn in
last week. 'It's a question of how to provide the merits to the public in
the framework of a market economy.'
The government is putting on a more consumer-friendly face than its Liberal
Democratic party predecessor, which was the ally of the Japanese producer
during its 38 years in office.
Mr Takemura is urging importers to cut prices and adds: 'It is also
necessary for the general public to watch closely whether companies involved
will show readiness to pass on such gains.'
A survey of 4,000 housewives by the Economic Planning Agency this month
found that fewer than half thought imports had got any cheaper.
Electric utilities, the first to yield to the government's moral persuasion,
said they could manage cuts in charges which would save the average
household a princely Y50 (31p) a month.
Beyond these efforts, the coalition, headed by LDP defectors but also
comprising socialists and Buddhists, has seized on deregulation as a key
which it hopes will unlock trapped domestic demand.
Ministries and state agencies have been told to scour their statutes by
mid-September for rules and restrictions which can be abolished, thereby
freeing up economic activity.
Civil servants in Japan issue more than 10,900 different types of licence or
approval, a number which has been growing in spite of previous attempts to
streamline administrative procedures.
However, bureaucrats seeking to maintain the existing order are likely to
defend many of these on grounds such as safety - such as the 71 standards
which an imported car has to meet - or argue that established industries
will suffer.
An indication that government officials in many cases remain hostile to open
markets came this month when the Agriculture Ministry instructed importers
to go easy on shipments of foreign beef because domestic farmers were
suffering.
The move drew protests from the US and Australia, main beneficiaries of the
phased opening of the Japanese beef market from 1991. Tariffs were last cut
as recently as April.
Daiei, the country's largest supermarket chain, said this week it would
ignore the directive. Imports grew by a fifth last year to account for 60
per cent of all its beef sales. It says it has been reducing prices, citing
the example of a Kansas shoulder-cut which it brought down by 13 per cent in
May.
Daiei is big enough to do its importing directly, circumventing the big
trading houses, which are nervous of incurring official displeasure and at
which the order was mainly directed.
The chain - which will import some Y120bn (Pounds 760m) worth of foreign
goods this year, more than 5 per cent of all sales - insists that it passes
on currency benefits through its checkouts. But it says rises in overseas
labour and shipping costs have also to be taken into account.
The Japanese appetite for foreign branded goods, almost insatiable during
the late-1980s 'bubble' years of inflated asset values, has been dulled by
the current austere climate.
Department stores, also increasingly undercut by parallel importers which
sell goods more cheaply in less ritzy surroundings, are trying selective
promotions on less expensive lines. For a clothing sale being held next week
by Matsuzakaya the garments come from Quelle, a German mail order company.
Consumer demand has been weakest for big-ticket items such as cars. But in
spite of a 7.8 per cent fall in new car sales in Japan for the six months to
June, and the 71 impediments, some foreign automotive groups have fared
well.
Rover of the UK, minority-owned by Honda, lifted first-half shipments 44 per
cent after it began reducing prices in February. For Rover, the hope must be
that the yen does not now go too far into reverse and drive away it market.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LORD Owen and Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg, international mediators, yesterday
put their compromise map on the table, expressing 'disappointment' that Serb
and Croat leaders had not given more land to Bosnia's President Alija
Izetbegovic, their Moslem foe.
The leaders of the three warring parties will now return to their capitals
to consider the map before the deadline of August 20. Mr Izetbegovic
indicated that he may reject the map for rewarding military gain by the
Serbs.
Lord Owen, the EC envoy, said the proposed map did not represent an 'ideal
solution', but was the best deal he could salvage for Bosnia's Moslems, who
comprised 44 per cent of the republic's pre-war population of 4.35m. The
division gives Moslems 30 per cent, Serbs control 52 plus, and Croats 17 per
cent.
The district of Sarajevo will be made a virtual UN protectorate for a period
of up to two years while Mostar, the regional capital of Hercegovina, was
proposed to be placed under EC governance.
Mr Izetbegovic will be disappointed by the results of the eastern Bosnian
enclaves of Srebrenica and Zepa, two of the six UN-proclaimed 'safe areas',
which are joined to Gorazde, another safe area, by a Moslem-controlled road
but remain cut off from the Bosnian republic.
The map meets leaves Mr Izetbegovic a land-locked republic, only giving
Bosnia access to the northern River Sava at Brcko.

FT  21 AUG 93 / Unitary v water's edge: seeking a company tax deal: A look
at how the Californians do it - and how the British want it done
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE war over California's system of unitary taxation has dragged on for so
long now that views on both sides have become deeply entrenched.
But the stakes, both in a series of lawsuits that could reach the Supreme
Court soon and in a potentially damaging war of retaliation between the
British and US tax authorities, are high, and the search for a solution
appears to be gathering steam.
Around Dollars 900m (Pounds 600m) is at issue in the suit brought against
California's tax authorities by Barclays Bank of Britain, along with other
similar cases which depend on its outcome. Another Dollars 3.1bn is involved
in closely linked suits brought by US-based multinational companies.
In addition, retaliation ordered by the UK government, due to take effect on
January 1 if the dispute is not settled, could cost Californian companies
with UK subsidiaries some Pounds 250m.
The row concerns California's system for assessing how much of a company's
income should be taxed in the state, simple enough for a corner shop that
does business in only one place, but much more complicated for a group with
operations around the world.
International tax treaties are almost universally built on the 'arm's
length' principle: taxable profits for a subsidiary in one country will be
assessed as though it were conducting its business independently, and
products it buys from its parents will be priced as though they were bought
from an unrelated third party.
The unitary system, on the other hand, calculates the worldwide income of
the company, and assesses the tax due in proportion to the percentage of the
group's property, payroll and sales in the state.
The problem is that tax authorities in one country will only recognise that
companies have already paid taxes in another country if they are calculated
according to internationally agreed principles, so a company taxed on the
unitary basis by California may end up being taxed a second time elsewhere
on the same income.
Different companies may benefit from either approach, depending on their
circumstances. It depends on whether a company earns most of its profits in
the place where most of its property and employees are based.
A California company with lots of new overseas subsidiaries which are losing
money in their first years of operation would be taxed less under the
unitary system because these losses would be counted in its worldwide
income.
While opposition to unitary taxation is led by the UK, not all British
companies operating in California spurn it.
British Petroleum has spoken in favour of unitary assessment at hearings of
the California legislature.
Although one would never guess it by the furious arguments over the issue,
unitary assessments in fact ceased to be obligatory in California as a
result of changes in the tax law in 1986 and 1988.
Instead, companies can elect to be taxed under the 'water's edge' system, in
which only activities inside the US are considered.
Britain's practical concerns over this system, which would all be addressed
by the bill now expected to pass the California legislature by the middle of
September, are the fee charged to those who choose the water's edge system;
some complicated paperwork imposed only on companies choosing water's edge;
and the franchise tax board's right to override the choice of water's edge.
'We are moving in the direction of completely eliminating all perceived
discrimination against those who prefer the water's edge,' says Mr Brad
Sherman, chairman of the California state board of equalisation and a member
of the franchise tax board, who has taken the lead in the search for a
solution.
But the UK also objects to the continued existence of unitary assessment as
an option, and makes it clear it is looking for a mandatory water's edge
system. 'Anything less would fall short of that preferred solution,' says a
senior UK Treasury official.
'I think they so hate worldwide unitary taxation that they wish to stamp it
out,' comments Mr Sherman.
Mr Peter Welch, chairman of the Unitary Tax Campaign, a grouping of British
companies that has been fighting the California system for years, is worried
that other states may be waiting to move to unitary assessments if
California is allowed to keep the system on its own books - as they did in
the 1970s and 1980s before the threat of retaliation forced most to pull
back.
California's threadbare state finances would actually benefit from a
mandatory water's edge approach. Any time a company can choose between two
systems of assessment, it will logically choose the system which costs it
least. Removing this choice would generate an estimated Dollars 155m-Dollars
175m in additional tax revenue.
But for that very reason, efforts to promote mandatory water's edge
assessment have died in the legislature in the face of concerted opposition
from California business, which wants desperately to keep the choice.
'I think mandatory water's edge is a wonderful idea. Unfortunately it is not
on the table,' says Mr Sherman.
One of the great ironies of the unitary tax battle is that Barclays Bank is
now probably the party with the least interest in seeing California and the
UK settle their differences.

<TEXT>
AN ANGLO-AMERICAN consortium is poised to buy east Germany's large brown
coal fields, as well as a crucial stake in a power station, the Treuhand
privatisation agency confirmed yesterday.
Once completed, the negotiations, which started in mid-1992, will give
Britain's PowerGen and NRG of Minneapolis, a subsidiary of Northern States
Power, a strategic foothold in the region's utilities sector.
It could also help to open up the highly regulated energy sector and to
provide the consortium with a possible launch pad into neighbouring eastern
Europe.
A joint statement said the negotiations should be concluded within two or
three weeks.
A Treuhand official said yesterday he expected the consortium to invest
about DM1bn (Pounds 390m) in eastern Germany. However, neither PowerGen nor
NRG would confirm the purchase price.
They are buying Mitteldeutschen Braunkohle (Mibrag), extensive lignite
fields straddling the state of Saxony-Anhalt.
The fields, owned by the Treuhand, were put out to public tender last year.
The consortium recently co-opted Morrison Knudsen, the Idaho-based
international mining company. It holds a 33 per cent stake and will look
after the mining operations of Mibrag. PowerGen and NRG are also buying 44
per cent (the equivalent of 400MW capacity) of a power station at Schkopau,
near Leipzig. Schkopau is owned by Veba Kraftwerke Ruhr, the electricity
subsidiary of Veba, Germany's large energy-based conglomerate.
The consortium had hoped to obtain greater access to power generation. But
it has been limited by restrictions on access by outsiders to the high
voltage grid, which is monopolised by western Germany's large utility
companies. Investment in eastern Germany increased sharply last year despite
the recession in western Germany and the high level of labour costs in the
region, the Ifo institute for economic forecasting reported yesterday.
But investment in western Germany continued to decline, a trend which is
expected to continue all year.
In the five new states investment increased by 30 per cent to DM16.6bn
(Pounds 6.4bn) last year, compared to 1991; raw materials, food processing
and services sector accounted for more than 70 per cent. But signs of
investment in the region's uncompetitive industrial base, or indications of
the growth of new industrial sectors, have yet to emerge. According to the
Ifo survey, investment in industry rose 12 per cent in 1992 but will decline
this year.

FT  21 AUG 93 / Japan denies agreement to cut its discount rate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S government yesterday tried to quell speculation that it had secretly
agreed with Washington to cut its official discount rate from 2.5 per cent.
Mr Hiroshisa Fujii, the finance minister, said Thursday's dollar-buying
intervention by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was not the result of a
new agreement between Japan and the US on the yen-dollar exchange rate.
Market speculation about a bilateral deal, which came after a statement by
Mr Lawrence Summers, US treasury under-secretary, welcoming a recent decline
in Japan's money rates, helped support the dollar in the Tokyo market
yesterday. The dollar closed up Y2.47 at Y104.45. It closed in London at
Y104.85.
While Japanese officials welcomed the Fed's intervention, they admitted the
trend towards a higher yen was unlikely to abate until Japan took concrete
steps to deal with its huge trade surplus by stimulating the domestic
economy.
The dollar's rebound came as Japan's Economic Planning Agency submitted a
gloomy monthly report on the economy to the cabinet.
The August report revised the agency's earlier judgment that the Japanese
economy had bottomed out. It said the economy was in an adjustment phase and
signs of recovery appeared to be faltering because of new adverse factors,
including a cold summer and the sharp climb of the yen.
The report also said personal consumption and corporate capital spending
remained sluggish. Industrial production was stagnant while the employment
situation was deteriorating.
The report confirmed growing concerns in Japan that the economy was in a
delicate state and needed substantial fiscal and monetary measures to help
it on the road to sustained growth.
The government has so far focused on steps to pass on the benefits of a
higher yen to consumers and deregulate Japan's markets as the pillars of its
September economic stimulus package.
Although it has not indicated whether fiscal and monetary measures would be
included in a package of economic stimulus measures to be delivered next
month, recognition was growing among government officials that such measures
might need to be considered.
Mr Hiroshi Kumagai, trade minister, said yesterday the public wanted fiscal
and monetary measures to be included in the stimulus package and indicated
that steps such as a cut in the official discount rate should be considered.
Mr Tsutomu Tanaka, deputy director general of the Economic Planning Agency,
said fiscal and monetary measures were not being excluded from
consideration.
The government is also facing growing pressure to implement income tax cuts
and issue deficit-covering bonds.

FT  21 AUG 93 / Finland plans further spending cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Finnish government yesterday proposed a further FM10bn in spending cuts
next year as part of a continuing austerity drive to reduce the country's
budget deficit, writes Christopher Brown-Humes in Stockholm. The cuts, which
amount to 2 per cent of gross domestic product, reflect the continued
recession in the Finnish economy, which is expected to shrink by 2.5 per
cent this year, its third consecutive year of decline.
Expenditure is to be held at FM188bn (Pounds 21bn) in 1994 in line with the
government's commitment to keep spending in real terms at 1991 levels.
To meet this target, it is proposing a sharp cut in government transfers to
local authorities, a tightening of unemployment benefit rules, no increase
in social security and pension payments, and a 6.5 per cent reduction in the
government sector wage bill.
The government says its main priorities are to tackle unemployment, which
now exceeds 20 per cent of the workforce, and create conditions for
sustained growth in the economy. Many of its problems stem from the increase
in unemployment, which has reduced tax revenues.

FT  21 AUG 93 / Sharp rise in east German investment
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
INVESTMENTS in eastern Germany increased sharply last year despite the
recession in western Germany and the high level of labour costs in the
region, the Ifo institute for economic forecasting reported yesterday.
But investments in western Germany continued to decline, a trend which is
expected to continue all year.
Investments in the five new states increased by 30 per cent to DM16.6bn
(Pounds 6.4bn) last year, compared to 1991, with raw materials, food
processing and services sector accounting for over 70 per cent. But signs of
investment in the region's uncompetitive industrial base, or indications of
the growth of new industrial sectors, have yet to emerge. According to the
Ifo survey, investments in industry rose 12 per cent in 1992 but will
decline this year.
The high level of investments in the east is partly explained by earlier
commitments by west German companies made immediately after unification,
which were spread over a few years, and backed by generous subsidies. This
trend is expected to continue throughout 1993, when investments are likely
to peak at DM20bn. The investment growth in the east is in marked contrast
to those in western Germany. They fell 6 per cent in 1992 over the previous
year because of the recession.

FT  21 AUG 93 / Japan quells speculation of deal to cut discount rate
</HEADLINE>

JAPAN'S government yesterday tried to quell speculation that it had secretly
agreed with Washington to cut its official discount rate from 2.5 per cent.
Mr Hiroshisa Fujii, the finance minister, said Thursday's dollar-buying
intervention by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was not the result of a
new agreement between Japan and the US on the yen-dollar exchange rate.
Market speculation about a bilateral deal, which came after a statement by
Mr Lawrence Summers, US treasury under-secretary, welcoming a recent decline
in Japan's money rates, helped support the dollar in the Tokyo market
yesterday. The dollar closed up Y2.47 to close at Y104.45. It closed in
London at Y104.85.
While Japanese officials welcomed the Fed's intervention, they admitted that
the trend towards a higher yen was unlikely to abate until Japan took
concrete steps to deal with its huge trade surplus by stimulating the
domestic economy.
The dollar's rebound came as Japan's Economic Planning Agency submitted a
gloomy monthly report on the economy to the cabinet.
The August report revised the agency's earlier judgment that the Japanese
economy had bottomed out. It said the economy was in an adjustment phase and
signs of recovery appeared to be faltering because of new adverse factors,
including a cold summer and the sharp appreciation of the yen.
The report also said personal consumption and corporate capital spending
remained sluggish. Industrial production was stagnant while the employment
situation was deteriorating.
The report confirmed growing concerns in Japan that the economy was in a
delicate state and needed substantial fiscal and monetary measures to help
it on the road to sustained growth.
The government has so far focused on steps to pass on the benefits of a
higher yen to consumers and deregulate Japan's markets as the pillars of its
September economic stimulus package.
Although it has not indicated whether fiscal and monetary measures would be
included in a package of economic stimulus measures to be delivered next
month, recognition was growing among government officials that such measures
might need to be considered.
Mr Hiroshi Kumagai, trade minister, said yesterday the Japanese public
wanted fiscal and monetary measures to be included in the stimulus package
and indicated that steps such as a cut in the official discount rate should
be considered.
Mr Tsutomu Tanaka, deputy director general of the Economic Planning Agency,
mentioned further that fiscal and monetary measures were not being excluded
from consideration.
The government is also facing growing pressure to implement income tax cuts
and issue deficit-covering bonds but has so far resisted these calls on the
grounds that the revenue base was already severely squeezed.

FT  21 AUG 93 / UK still unhappy with California tax proposals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH officials are hastily seeking to reverse the impression that
proposed changes to the California tax law, agreed by senators this week,
would satisfy their complaints about the state's system of unitary taxation.
The UK government has been fighting the unitary system for two decades, and
has threatened to withhold a tax credit from Californian companies operating
in the UK if the issue is not resolved by the end of this year.
A California senate committee this week agreed on changes to the tax law
that would enable any company to choose an alternative method of tax
assessment, known as water's edge, to which the British government does not
object.
Committee staff said they had been unofficially assured by the UK that the
proposed changes would be enough to remove the threat of retaliation.
'I am confident that this will take the heat off,' said Mr Steve Larson, the
staff director of the state senate budget committee.
The British Treasury, however, has hurried to deny that it has given any
such private assurance, and took the matter seriously enough to interrupt Mr
Kenneth Clarke, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, on his holiday.
The proposed changes would address several specific complaints about the
current law, which allows this water's edge option, but charges a fee for it
which brings the state around Dollars 45m (Pounds 30.2m) a year.
But the UK has been insisting on the total elimination of unitary
assessments, and on a move to make water's edge taxation mandatory for all
companies in California.
UK Treasury officials have reiterated that they are looking for a mandatory
water's edge system, and that anything less would fall short of that
preferred solution.
They said, however, that they would study the Californian legislative
proposals with care, and take a view when they have assessed the final law.
Both the UK and US Treasuries are caught, to some extent, in the middle of
the battleground.
The UK Treasury's natural inclination would probably be to avoid
retaliation, which could trigger a costly transatlantic tax war, but it is
under considerable pressure from senior backbench MPs and from British
business to maintain a tough posture.
The US Treasury, meanwhile, is seeking to avoid getting directly involved,
while gently encouraging California to move towards legislation that would
turn away British wrath.

FT  21 AUG 93 / Compromise Bosnia peace deal proposed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PEACE mediators in Geneva yesterday presented the three sides in the Bosnian
conflict with a compromise plan for the ethnic partition of the country, and
warned the Bosnian Moslems that they must accept the proposal or face more
war.
The mediators also appealed to the European Commission to administer the
disputed central Bosnian city of Mostar as part of a peace package to end
the 17-month war.
The peace talks have now been adjourned for 10 days to allow the three sides
to discuss the latest plan with their respective parliaments.
The Serb and Croat delegations said they accepted the new map for the
partition, and welcomed the proposals as a step towards ending the war.
The Moslem-led Bosnian delegation accused the mediators of rewarding Serb
and Croat conquests. Its members planned to present the proposals to the
Bosnian parliament, but foreign minister Mr Haris Silajdzic later told the
BBC he believed they would be rejected. Moslem President Alija Izetbegovic
said the plan might help in the pursuit of peace, 'maybe not in such a form
but in a corrected form'.
The compromise map, broadly similar to previous proposals presented by Serb
and Croat leaders, gives the Moslems up to 30 per cent of the land, placing
Sarajevo, the capital, under UN administration.
Mostar is provisionally labelled as a Commission-controlled city, although
Lord Owen, the EC mediator, said the Commission had yet to accept this task.
Lord Owen denied he had caved in to Serb and Croat pressures and said there
was no ideal solution to the Bosnian conflict. 'It's not as generous as I
would have liked but they (the Moslems) got 30 per cent, which was the
criterion which we set two months ago,' he said.
Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg, the UN mediator, will fly to New York early next
week to report to Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary-general.
Implementation of the peace plan would require 40,000 UN peacekeeping
troops.
The UN high commissioner for refugees (UNHCR) yesterday accused Croats of
new atrocities against the Bosnian Moslems 'as brutal as any so far
witnessed' during the war.
The UNHCR said that in recent weeks the Bosnian Croat forces had conducted a
campaign of 'brutal ethnic cleansing' against Moslems in south-western
Bosnia.
The Croat leadership vehemently denied the allegations. Its protests were
discounted by UN officials, who said that up to 15,000 draft-age Moslem men
were now being held in detention centres in western Bosnia, after Bosnian
Croat forces rounded up men from Mostar.

FT  21 AUG 93 / BAe chief to visit Taiwan in move to clinch jet deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN CAHILL, chairman of British Aerospace, is expected in Taiwan next
week in an attempt to resolve differences with Taiwan Aerospace (TAC) on
setting up a Pounds 250m joint venture between the two companies.
The trip follows comments yesterday from Mr Liang Kuo-shu, chairman of the
state development Chiao Tung Bank, a big shareholder in TAC, that the issue
of collateral for loans to the joint venture remained the obstacle to
concluding the deal.
The venture, called Avro, is intended to make BAe's RJ series of regional
jet aircraft in the UK and Taiwan. It is vital to BAe's recovery strategy
and offers Taiwan a route into the aviation industry.
BAe said: 'Public discussion of the state of talks in Taiwan would damage
the future of Avro.' It would not confirm Mr Cahill's visit.
Mr Denny Ko, TAC's president, said Mr Cahill would arrive by August 23 and
added that differences could be resolved 'if there is a will'.
Mr Liang said he would also be meeting Mr Cahill and other BAe executives
next week to discuss the issue. The disagreement between the two sides
centres on collateral for loans that Taiwanese banks need to make to Avro.
BAe's 50 per cent share in Avro is in the form of land, plant and machinery
in the UK, whereas TAC and Taiwanese banks are committed to putting up the
remainder in cash.
The state-owned Chiao Tung Bank leads the consortium of lender banks and
plans to own 10 per cent of Avro. But under article 32 of Taiwan's banking
law, a bank cannot offer unsecured financing to any company in which it
holds more than a 3 per cent interest.
Mr Liang said 'something concrete' was needed as collateral before the
consortium would agree to the financing.
Behind the dispute lie concerns among some Taiwanese private investors that
the enterprise will not make money. One of the reasons that BAe wants a
partner is that the RJ series of aircraft has been selling slowly.
On July 27, Taiwan's premier, Mr Lien Chan, declared the government's
support for the venture. At the same time, government involvement in Avro,
through its Chiao Tung bank, was increased.

FT  21 AUG 93 / Bundesbank lifts rate cut hopes: Sharp appreciation of
D-Mark would be 'undesirable', says Tietmeyer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bundesbank yesterday prompted renewed speculation about the likelihood
of further cuts in German interest rates by saying these might be possible
as long as inflation and monetary developments permitted.
Mr Hans Tietmeyer, deputy-president and president-elect of the Bundesbank,
also said a substantial appreciation of the D-Mark within Europe was
'undesirable' because of the need to preserve exporters' competitiveness.
Coupled with an observation about the possibility of more small cuts in
interest rates - as long as inflation and movements in money supply allowed
such a step - Mr Tietmeyer's comments led yesterday to a further
depreciation in the value of the D-Mark against most European currencies.
Mr Tietmeyer's comments were contained in a speech he was due to give at a
bankers' conference in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. Mr Tietmeyer did not attend
the conference but the speech was distributed by the German central bank as
an authorised policy statement.
The French franc, in particular, continued to strengthen against the German
currency, helped by the effect of two cuts in the Bank of France's lending
rates earlier this week. The franc closed in London at FFr3.478 against the
D-Mark from a previous FFr3.495 but eased in late New York trading to
FFr3.4846.
Mr Tietmeyer's comments revived speculation about the timing of a cut in the
German discount rate from its current level of 6.75 per cent. It was unclear
yesterday when the Bundesbank would judge the time to be right for a
reduction given current monetary conditions in Germany.
Money supply figures published on Thursday showed broad money, or M3,
climbing at 7.5 per cent in July on a seasonally adjusted, annualised basis
 -far above the 4.5 per cent to 6.5 per cent target range. As Mr Tietmeyer
was careful to make clear in his manuscript, inflation and money supply
developments are central to interest rate decisions.
'It is by no means a foregone conclusion that they will cut next Thursday
(after the Bundesbank council meeting),' said Mr Joachim Fels, economist at
Goldman Sachs in Frankfurt.
It was the Bundesbank's decision not to cut the discount rate at its council
meeting on July 29 which led to the immediate crisis in the European
exchange rate mechanism at the beginning of August, when the bands in which
ERM currencies are allowed to fluctuate were widened.
The wider bands meant that the implications of German monetary policy were
now less important than before, Mr Tietmeyer's manuscript said. 'The
individual countries now have more room for manoeuvre for interest rate
movements,' he said.
'Such increased flexibility is certainly a gain, since the inflationary
risks in the individual countries currently differ.'
As a result the Bundesbank would not have to pay so much attention to the
direct implications of German monetary policy in neighbouring countries.
'Although of course a major appreciation of the D-Mark within Europe is
undesirable in the light of German exporters' need to remain competitive,'
he added.
The D-Mark has appreciated by 7.4 per cent against other European currencies
since the beginning of September last year, exacerbating German industry's
problems amid the most serious economic downturn since the second world war.
Figures published this week reveal a weakening in exports, which were down
5.8 per cent in May.

FT  21 AUG 93 / Super-rich escape the worst of UK recession
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY and RACHEL JOHNSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE OFFICIAL inflation rate may be 1.4 per cent, but the UK's super wealthy
appear to have been hit less hard by price increases than the rest of the
recession-weary public.
The Financial Times has found that for a 'basket' of luxury items, the
overall increase in price has been only 1.2 per cent in the past year.
But even the super-rich have been discouraged from spending by recession -
the reason most commonly cited for holding prices steady was lack of demand.
The basket of goods included:
A 'Richmond' hamper from Fortnum and Mason, complete with non-vintage
champagne, Sancerre, pates and cheeses, priced Pounds 150 this year,
unchanged from 1992.
A double-breasted pinstripe suit of best-quality wool yarn, from Huntsman's,
the bespoke Savile Row tailor, priced Pounds 1,908 this year, also the same
as last year.
A pair of men's brogues - handmade by Lobb's, the gentleman's cobbler that
has been in St James's Street for four generations - priced Pounds 1,095
this year, a 6 per cent increase on last year.
A London-New York return by Concorde unchanged at Pounds 5,030 (with a
special offer fare of Pounds 4,220 available).
But more averagely wealthy families may have found their household budgets
rising by more than the Retail Prices Index. Wealthier families spend a
higher proportion of their income than poorer ones on leisure services,
motoring, alcohol and clothing. Only the last category has not increased in
price.
They also tend to be hit by expenses not included in the RPI. Average term
fees for Headmasters' Conference schools (the big public and independent
schools) have risen 8.3 per cent to Pounds 3,425.
Holy grail still proves elusive, Page 6

<TEXT>
THE Turkish government may sell its 40 per cent stake in Turkiye Isbankasi,
Turkey's biggest commercial bank, in a deal worth around Dollars 400m at
current stock market prices.
The treasury is looking at a possible global offering, or placing the shares
with foreign or domestic institutions. Bank officials say they expect the
treasury to announce details in the next few days.
Brokers expect big foreign interest, although the stake does not give
control as the bank's own pension fund currently owns 41 per cent. Around 17
per cent of Isbankasi was floated on the Istanbul stock exchange last year.
Shares have jumped 20 per cent in the past few days. The bank reported
profits of TL 843bn (Dollars 729m) in 1992.
The bank has 855 branches. It is divesting investments in an effort to bring
capital adequacy ratios in line with international levels.

FT  20 AUG 93 / Amazon tribal 'massacre'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINA LAMB
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   RIO DE JANEIRO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Brazilian police yesterday began investigating a reported massacre of up
to 19 Yanomami tribal people - the second such incident in two months.
It is alleged to have been carried out by garimpeiros (itinerant
goldminers), and the killings have set off new fears for the Amazon's most
populous indigenous tribe.
Between 14 and 19 Yanomami men, women and children were reported as
decapitated by machetes at the remote settlement of Haximu in the northern
state of Roraima, according to officials of the National Indian Foundation
(Funai).
In a similar incident in July, five or six Yanomami were murdered in the
same region.
The motive for the tribal killings is unknown but there has long been
tension between the garimpeiros and the Yanomami, whose lands encompass what
are thought to be some of the world's richest mineral deposits.
Two years ago, after international pressure, the government declared a 9.4m
hectare reserve to protect the estimated 9,000 remaining Yanomami and
expelled the goldminers, who were bringing violence, disease and pollution
into the area.

FT  20 AUG 93 / Bundesbank's money target missed again
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER and ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT, PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GROWTH in German money supply has exceeded the target range set by the
Bundesbank for the fourth consecutive month.
According to provisional figures, M3 - which comprises cash in circulation
as well as savings and short-term time deposits - grew at 7.5 per cent in
July on an annualised, seasonally adjusted basis. This follows growth of 7
per cent in June and compares with a target range of 4.5 to 6.5 per cent.
Although the headline figure was in line with the expectations of
economists, there was disappointment about a sharp, 8 per cent rise in bank
credits to companies and private individuals over the past six months.
This is an increase from the 7.6 per cent growth rate in the six months to
July. Economists said that the August M3 was likely to climb still higher,
reflecting Bundesbank currency interventions.
The disappointing July M3 figure was released just a week before the
Bundesbank's policy-making council meets on August 26 to consider whether
monetary conditions warrant additional interest rate cuts. Yesterday Mr
Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank president, warned of the 'grave
disruptions' which can occur on financial markets if high expectations of
interest rate cuts are not fulfilled.
In remarks reported by a German news agency, he said that the currency
market upheaval of recent weeks 'should make it clear to everyone' what
happens when markets are fed with unrealistic expectations.
Alice Rawsthorn in Paris adds: Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European
Commission, yesterday criticised Chancellor Helmut Kohl for suggesting that
the EC might have to delay the timetable for monetary union. Mr Delors said
that the chancellor's remarks had 'added to the doubts' on monetary union.

FT  20 AUG 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equities easier after turbulent
session
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN EXPECTED bout of profit-taking in the London stock market was overwhelmed
yesterday by a series of unforeseen developments elsewhere in the global
markets arena. A very sharp increase in the US trade deficit in June, a
bombing raid on Iraq by American aircraft, and a warning on the economic
outlook from Hang Seng Bank, Hong Kong subsidiary of HSBC, prompted a
turbulent session for share prices. But all ended well, with the FT-SE 100
Index rallying to close a net 8.1 off at 3,065.5.
London market strategists professed themselves satisfied with the final
picture, pointing out that the fall on the Footsie was of little
significance when measured against the upsurge of the past month.
Equities opened higher, largely on the back of US buying orders laid down
overnight by Wall Street investors celebrating the record close on the Dow
Industrial Average.
Within half-an-hour of the official opening, the FT-SE 100 was 15.6 points
ahead at a new trading peak of 3,089.2, and traders were hoping to see the
3,100 mark challenged before the end of the day.
In the banking sector, Barclays rose sharply on the announcement that the
bank has appointed the new chief executive for which it has been seeking.
However, neither UK government bonds nor stock index futures would give
support and the market began to soften. The report from Hang Seng Bank,
expressing some caution on the outlook for global economies, cast a cloud
over the London market's newly inspired confidence. Share prices turned off
smartly and market traders began to take some of the large paper profits
already chalked up in the equity trading account which opened on Monday.
The hardest blow, however, came just before Wall Street opened, with the
news that the US trade deficit had jumped by about 44 per cent in June. The
Footsie quickly dropped to 3,054.8, a turnround of 33 points since the early
part of the trading session.
London feared the worst, but was proved wrong when the US bond market held
up relatively well and the Dow Jones Industrial Average also held steady to
show a gain of 3.08 points in UK trading hours. The Footsie staged a good
recovery to close on a buoyant note in good turnover, but restrained by
substantial falls in HSBC and similarly Far Eastern-orientated stocks.
Seaq volume remained high at 836.9m shares, if slightly below Wednesday's
887.1m; retail, or customer, business jumped to Pounds 1.92bn on Wed nesday
as overseas investors bought heavily into UK equities.
Traders said that foreign investors had held back yesterday, while UK funds
had switched their attention to the second line stocks. Non-Footsie shares
made up around 62 per cent of the Seaq total, although the FT-SE Mid 250
Index dipped 8.9 to 3,486.0.
The international blue chip stocks had a difficult session as the US dollar
came under pressure before finding support from the Federal Reserve. The
drug sector held firm but saw little evidence of the renewed support from
the US which has stimulated the sector's rally from its heavy setback.
Domestic interest-related issues moved erratically as a weaker session in
the UK bond market challenged some of the optimism for base rate cuts.

FT  20 AUG 93 / London Stock Exchange: BAe setback
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in British Aerospace came under pressure after Taiwan's
vice-economics minister was quoted as saying that BAe's regional jets joint
venture with Taiwan may not go ahead due to differences between BAe and
local banks over its financing.
The reports sent the stock tumbling, and at the day's worst the shares were
down 23 at 445p. A denial of problems in the negotiations from British
Aerospace helped to steady nerves and the shares clawed back some of the
earlier loss to finish 14 lighter at 454p on volume of 4m.
Mr Sandy Morris at NatWest Securities said: 'The regional jets deal is no
longer a make or break issue for BAe, particularly after the disposal of the
corporate jets business, but we believe the regional jets venture still has
commercial logic and it will go through.'
The heavy end of the building sectors came under sustained selling pressure
following bearish comments on the sector from Carr Kitcat &amp; Aitken, the
stockbroker, and following on from the rather gloomy picture painted by
Marley on Monday.
Redland, down 17 at 513p, and RMC, 18 lower at 795p, were the two main
casualties in the sector, with Rugby 4 easier at 278p and Marley 6 cheaper
at 157p.
BPB slipped 2 1/2 to 250p after Philips &amp; Drew Fund Management said it had
reduced its holding to below the 3 per cent notifiable level.
Pilkington ordinary edged up to 152p and the warrants 2 to 52 1/2 p, with
some dealers taking the view that the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority had
recently been reducing its stake in the ordinaries and increasing its
holdings in the warrants.
Merchant banks and quoted market operators enjoyed another strong session
with investors chasing the stocks higher again in response to the continuing
high level of stock market activity. SG Warburg, viewed by many as the
London market's leading and most successful integrated securities house,
raced up 9 more to a peak 813p while Kleinwort Benson, another of the City's
most powerful integrated operations, jumped 8 to 507p, its highest level
since the Great Crash of October 1987. Smith New Court added 8 to a peak
342p.
Prudential moved up 4 to 332p as insurance specialists began to focus on the
group's poor performance against the market over the past month; 'the shares
are due a bounce after underperforming the market by over 12 per cent on the
month and by almost 5 per cent in the past quarter,' noted one specialist.
Among brewers, James Capel was said to have issued a buy recommendation for
several of the stocks in the sector, though the agency broker refused to
confirm the recommendation. Bass, was said to have been among the stocks
included on the buy list. Sentiment in the stock was also helped by news
that it had sold 46 pubs to Marston, Thompson &amp; Evershed for Pounds 10.78m.
The shares gained 5 to 511p.
A broker's recommendation together with a disposal combined to boost
Hillsdown Holdings. Hoare Govett were said to have recommended the stock on
yield considerations. The shares close 5 up at 171p.
Turnover in Cray Electronics shares leapt to over 18m after Sir Peter
Michael, a former director, sold a total of almost 9m shares at 140p. The 9m
was made up of his existing holding of 3.4m shares and 5.6m shares acquired
by the conversion of 'A' and 'B' Convertible shares. Cray shares edged up 2
1/2 to 148 1/2 p.
Cadbury-Schweppes put on 10 to 501p, after it was recommended by SG Warburg,
its joint broker. A food contamination scare in Australia weakened shares in
United Biscuits and they fell 7 to 391p.
Shares in Granada Group bucked the market trend finishing 2 ahead at 446p,
on reports of a recommendation from Kleinwort Benson.
Compass Group jumped 18 to 566p, after a recommendation from SG Warburg.
Fears for the dividend, together with profit taking combined to leave Lucas
Industries 4 lighter at 158p.
Among transport stocks, shares in Dawson Group, jumped 60 to 303p, after it
reported impressive interim figures.

<TEXT>
The appointment by Barclays of Mr Martin Taylor as its new chief executive
as from January 1 next year triggered a burst of heavy buying in Barclays
shares, which touched 494p at one point before ending 19 up at 491p.
Turnover in Barclays totalled 16m, well above usual levels of activity and
the highest single day's trade since the aftermath of the bank's first-ever
preliminary loss and the halved dividend announced last March.
The appointment of Mr Taylor was described as 'very good news' by one banks
specialist, although he professed surprise at the extent of the share price
rise. Mr Taylor is currently chairman and chief executive of Courtaulds
Textiles. The latter's shares tumbled as the news came out, closing 15 lower
at 548p on turnover of 1.5m.
The rise in Barclays came at the expense of other banks, notably Lloyds,
which fell 10 to 535p on hefty turnover of 4.1m as some institutions
switched between the two stocks.

FT  20 AUG 93 / London Stock Exchange: Shares in HSBC savaged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MASSIVE rerating and upsurge in HSBC shares since the Hong Kong bank's
July 1992 merger with Midland Bank, of the UK, was brought to a shuddering
halt yesterday after the UK market reacted with dismay to much lower than
expected profits from HSBC's Hong Kong subsidiary Hang Seng Bank.
The Hong Kong subsidiary posted profits up 17 per cent at HKDollars 2.75bn,
compared with HKDollars 2.37bn, while the market had expected a profits rise
in the region of 23 per cent. Hang Seng accompanied its results with a
cautious review of prospects in the region.
HSBC is by far the largest of the UK-registered banks, measured by market
capitisation, dwarfing others such as Barclays, NatWest and Lloyds. Some
London-based analysts put on a brave face as marketmakers savaged the HSBC
share price. One said: 'The market has not taken on board the fact that it
was only recently that the Hong Kong banks began to lift the veil of secrecy
that has surrounded their real profits for the last 60 years. There is a
feeling that Hang Seng may have only declared something like 80 per cent of
their real profits during the half year.' The analyst added that a much
clearer picture would emerge with Hang Seng's full-year numbers.
HSBC is scheduled to report interim results on August 31, with analysts
previously looking for profits in excess of Pounds 1.25bn, up from Pounds
521m, boosted by the inclusion of profits from Midland Bank and the big
shift in the value of the HK dollar against sterling.
HSBC shares, trading at 341p at the time of the Midland merger in July last
year, subsided to 316p by last August before embarking on a remarkable run
which took the share price up to a record 772p earlier this week. Yesterday
it dropped 40, or 5.2 per cent, to 724p, with the Hong Kong-registered
shares down 35 at 706p.
Turnover in HSBC 75p shares reached 13m, with more than 3m of the Hong
Kong-registered shares changing hands.
The Hang Seng shock also jolted Standard Chartered shares from their upward
tack. Worries that profits growth generated by the bank's Far Eastern
businesses could slow saw Standard slide 25 to 964p.

FT  20 AUG 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRADING volumes remained high in the London derivatives markets yesterday
but they drifted lower in the absence of the overseas demand seen in the
previous session, writes Terry Byland.
In stock index futures, the September Footsie contract broke through 3,100,
moving to a new trading peak of 3,201 in early trading, but this level was
lost as it became clear that there was no follow-through to what had clearly
been the buying orders in the overnight postbag.
A disappointing interim report from Hang Seng Bank, the Hong Kong subsidiary
of HSBC, and then a substantial, and unexpected, rise in the US trade
deficit, undermined both stock index futures and the underlying share
prices. The September contract fell to 3,065 before steadying to close at
3,073, virtually in line with the fair value premium estimated at 4 points
against the cash market. Turnover reached 12,374 contracts.
Volume in traded options dipped to 46,299 contracts from Wednesday's 74,157
as traders braced themselves for expiry today of the Footsie Index options.
The Footsie Option traded 15,523 contracts and the Euro Footsie 5,549
yesterday.
Among individual stock options, British Gas stood out with 3,553 contracts
as investors continued to weigh the import of the report from the UK
Monopolies and Mergers Commission.

FT  20 AUG 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Falling bond yields offset
poor trade data
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US STOCK markets edged ahead to new highs yesterday as another big decline
in bond yields offset an unexpectedly bad set of June trade figures, writes
Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 7.27 at 3,612.13,
another all-time high. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 also
rose to a new record, ending 0.39 firmer at 456.43, while the American SE
composite added 1.33 at 447.96. The Nasdaq composite, however, ran into
profit-taking and ended 4.35 down at 730.48. New York SE volume was 293m
shares.
Trading was more subdued at the opening after the previous day's active
session. Profit-taking led to early declines as the markets digested
mid-week gains, but sentiment remained unchanged, and prices gradually
recovered from the initial losses. The latest economic news, however, was
not helpful. The widening in the June trade deficit from Dollars 8.4bn to
Dollars 12.1bn - the largest shortfall since October 1987 - was worrying,
because the increase in the deficit was primarily the result of a sharp fall
in exports.
The decline in export sales led analysts to warn that the second quarter
gross domestic product figures would probably have to be revised downwards.
But the depressing economic news was overshadowed by further declines in
Treasury yields. The benchmark 30-year bond climbed another three-quarters
of a point, pushing the yield down to 6.192 per cent, the lowest in the
issue's 16-year history.
Leading pharmaceutical and consumer shares were in demand for a second
consecutive day. Merck put on Dollars  5/8 at Dollars 33 1/8 , Johnson &amp;
Johnson Dollars  3/8 at Dollars 40 3/8 , American Home Products Dollars  1/8
at Dollars 63 1/4 and Bristol-Myers Squibb Dollars  1/8 at Dollars 56 5/8 .
Among the consumer stocks, Philip Morris added Dollars  1/2 at Dollars 50
5/8 , Coca-Cola Dollars 1 at Dollars 43 3/4 and Pepsico Dollars 1 1/4 at
Dollars 40 1/8 .
Motor and airline issues, which ran into selling earlier this week,
rebounded. General Motors was up Dollars 1 1/4 at Dollars 45 1/2 and Ford
Dollars  5/8 at Dollars 50 7/8 . Chrysler held steady at Dollars 42. UAL
firmed Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 145 3/8 and Delta Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 52
3/4 .
AT&amp;T, which announced the Dollars 12bn acquisition of McCaw Cellular at the
start of the week, fell Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 58 1/4 in volume of 6.16m
shares on reports that 'Baby Bell' competitors plan to press the government
to allow them to provide long-distance services and to manufacture telephone
equipment.
General Electric eased Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 96 5/8 in busy trading on
reports that the company will cut 4,000 workers from its Ohio jet division
as part of an overall plan for workforce reduction.
Canada
THE TORONTO market saw a day of consolidation after its recent strength and
ended little changed following relatively moderate trading.
The TSE 300 index gained just 0.3 at 4,069.6 as declines narrowly led rises
by 368 to 357 after volume of 52.6m shares.
Air Canada shed 20 cents to CDollars 4.70, giving back most of the ground
won yesterday when it offered to buy Canadian Airlines' international
business for CDollars 200m.

FT  20 AUG 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses more pensive after
recent gains
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOURSES faltered a little yesterday after an early attempt at flying higher,
writes Our Markets Staff.
They had cause. News of US warplanes bombing northern Iraq sent bullion
prices higher, and German M3 grew by 7.5 per cent in July after 7 per cent
in June. Some investors were also worried that laggard stocks and sectors
had been prominent in recent gains, indicating that a correction might be
around the corner.
However, strategists seemed inclined to stay on board. Mr Marcus Grubb, at
Salomon Brothers in London, said that on average, most European bourses were
trading on yield ratios (bond yields to dividend yields) which are cheap by
a factor of 15 to 40 per cent compared with ten year averages. The cheapest
markets, he said, were Italy, Spain and France.
FRANKFURT inched to another 1993 closing high, the DAX index rising 3.26 to
1,938.98 after an intraday 1,946.39. The M3 figures, coming after hours,
seemed mostly built into brokers' calculations; the Ibis indicated DAX eased
only 1.14 to 1,937.84 in the post-bourse.
Turnover eased from DM10.4bn to DM10.2bn. Engineers, steels and carmakers,
in the van of this year's gains, mostly showed falls although BMW, an
underperformer for much of this year, rose DM5 to DM574. Utilities, also
underperformers, rose too, RWE by DM6.30 to DM426.50 and Viag by DM8 to
DM458.50.
Schering, which has changed categories this month, rose another DM36 to
DM997 on prospects for its Betaseron drug, up by DM167, or 20 per cent this
month against a 7.5 per cent DAX index gain.
PARIS fell back by 1 per cent as investors ignored a further slight easing
in the 24 hour lending rate. The CAC-40 index, however, managed a last
minute improvement from the day's low of 2,131 to end down 21.55 at
2,139.20.
Turnover was some FFr3.8bn. Alcatel Alsthom remained at the top of the most
actives even although the South Korean authorities delayed further an
announcement on the award of the railway contract. The shares added FFr9 to
FFr734 in heavy turnover of FFr468m.
Lafarge Coppee slipped FFr17.20 to FFr439 in reaction, analysts said, to a
media report that it may bid for a Belgian cement group. The company denied
the story later.
AMSTERDAM encountered some profit-taking although Elsevier showed a 4 per
cent gain, the shares rising Fl 5.60 to Fl 144.00, a new year's high, on
reports that it may acquire the Official Airline Guides of the US, formerly
owned by Maxwell Communications.
The CBS Tendency index fell 0.3 to 128.5. The strength in Elsevier helped
other sector stocks with VNU up Fl 1.80 to Fl 140.80, another year's high,
and Wolters Kluwer gaining Fl 1.90 to Fl 96.
ZURICH ended mixed and quiet, the SMI index easing 6.0 to 2,481.2. In
cyclicals, Brown Boveri came under pressure; yesterday's first-half results
from ABB Asea Brown Boveri were marginally above with expectations, said Mr
Frederick Hasslauer at Swiss Volksbank, but BBC bearers fell SFr18 to
SFr931.
MILAN saw profit-taking in spite of a good run in telecommunications. The
Comit index lost 1.38 to 617.60.
Interest was shown in Sip on reports that its cellular telephone operation
might be sold by next spring. Its shares gained L52 to L3,579, as Stet
advanced L76 to L4,476.
MADRID stayed bullish, if more restrained with the general index rising
another 1.50 to 291.96. Blue chips were mixed across the board, Telefonica
standing out with a gain of Pta55 to Pta1,615 after the AT&amp;T bid for McCaw
Cellular in the US. LISBON climbed to a new 1993 high, its index rising 0.9
per cent to 1,109.01 as foreign investors bought blue chip stocks.
COPENHAGEN's KFX index continued to pull ahead, gaining 2.74 to a new 1993
high of 100.73. Banks led the gains, Den Danske bank rising DKr17 to DKr392
on satisfaction with its half year results.
STOCKHOLM fell back, the Affarsvarlden general index losing 12.9 to 1,326 in
heavy turnover of SKr2.9bn. Reaction to Ericsson's half year results saw the
B recover from an intraday low of SKr367 to SKr376, off SKr1.
OSLO lost 2.2 per cent on profit-taking, leaving the composite index down
12.85 at 573.52 in turnover of NKr731m.
ISTANBUL gained 4.5 per cent as investors returned to equities after a
further fall in interest rates. The composite index put on 466.8 to 10,915
in turnover of some TL1,200bn.

FT  20 AUG 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): New fistful of 1993
highs around the Pacific Rim

<TEXT>
INVESTORS were discouraged by a lack of concrete measures to support Japan's
economy at the first meeting of the new government's economic affairs
ministers, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei average lost a further 85.71 to 20,687.47, having moved between
20,603.56 and 20,903.09. Foreign investors continued to be leading buyers,
but the index faltered on selling by financial institutions.
Volume declined to 250m shares from 288m. Falls outnumbered rises by 716 to
243, with 184 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks
slipped 11.10 to 1,664.76, but in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index edged up
1.10 to 1,271.60.
The ministers agreed on an economic package which would pass the benefits of
a higher yen to consumers, and on deregulation of industries and the
distribution system by the end of next month. Investors felt left out.
However, in spite of official denials of the possibility of an official
discount rate cut, traders said speculation on monetary easing was still
strong. Mr Robert Feldman, an economist at Salomon Brothers, said the BOJ
was likely to make a cut of 50 basis points by the end of September. But he
added that the cut was already discounted in share prices and it would take
75 to 100 basis points to make a large impact.
At corporate level, Cosmo Securities, the second tier broker which will be
bailed out by Daiwa Bank, ended at Y496, down from Friday's close of Y649.
Ricoh, the most active issue of the day, forged ahead Y28 to Y799 on the
company's development of technology to make paper-recycling copiers.
NEC retreated Y22 to Y988, falling below the Y1,000 level for the first time
since August 9. The stock had risen on hopes that the government would pump
in funds to improve the country's telecommunications infrastructure;
yesterday's lack of discussion was a disappointment.
In Osaka, the OSE average shed 117.54 to 22,555.83 in volume of 131.9m
shares, the highest since March 10. Roundup
THE REGION produced another fistful of record highs, although London
reactions to the Hang Seng Bank results in Hong Kong took some of the edge
off the day.
NEW ZEALAND, which has the unusual distinction of trading 48 per cent below
its all-time peak set in 1987, made up more ground as the NZSE-40 capital
index advanced 61.94, or 3.2 per cent, to 2,019.8.
Turnover was described as 'absolutely extraordinary' as it rocketed to
NZDollars 142m from Wednesday's estimated and extremely heavy NZDollars 90m.
Carter Holt Harvey and Fletcher Challenge led the way, climbing 20 cents to
NZDollars 3.39 and another 36 cents to NZDollars 3.83 after Fletcher's
surprising results on Wednesday, which triggered a rerating of both forestry
stocks
AUSTRALIA broke through the 1,900 barrier as buyers snapped up industrial
issues, the All Ordinaries index closing 31.6 higher at another post-1987
crash peak of 1,926.3.
Turnover was heavy at ADollars 630.9m. Brokers said Wall Street's record
high and improving bullion prices also provided momentum, the golds index
rising 61.6 to 2,218.0. CRA, in base metals and gold, jumped 42 cents to
ADollars 15.28.
KUALA LUMPUR achieved another high after a late surge in several blue chips,
including Tenaga Nasional and Telekom Malaysia. The KLSE composite index
ended 7.80 stronger at 798.82 as volume rose from 312.5m to 413.1m shares.
Malayan Banking firmed 50 cents to 15.60 ringgit after its impressive annual
results. Tenaga and Telekom rose 20 cents each to MDollars 11 and MDollars
16.10.
SEOUL finally wiped out the remaining losses following last week's ban on
trading under false or borrowed names, the composite index rising 24.79 to
737.97 in turnover of Won60bn.
BOMBAY's BSE 30-share index moved ahead a further 85.35 to 2,700.55 in trade
restricted to one hour to enable delivery of cash shares.
SINGAPORE tried to extend its record-breaking run but profit-taking came in
after an intraday all-time high of 1,963.85, and the Straits Times
Industrial index ended a net 2.62 down at 1,948.78.

FT  20 AUG 93 / World Stock Markets: China worries fail to halt Hong Kong's
rise - Simon Davies discusses the issues which have helped drive the equity
market higher
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Hong Kong equities are enjoying an impressive performance this month. The
Hang Seng index registered its fifth consecutive record high yesterday on
expectation of strong corporate results from the major index stocks.
The index closed yesterday at 7,605.26, up 38 per cent so far this year;
most brokers now expect it to break through the 8,000 barrier by the
year-end. After hours in London, the index gained a further 21 points.
While confidence took a slight blow yesterday, as Hang Seng Bank, a
subsidiary of HSBC, announced disappointing results and warned of difficult
economic conditions during the next 12 months, brokers do not expect this to
have a negative effect on sentiment. Hang Seng Bank lost 50 cents to
HKDollars 61.
Gone are the worries over the impact of the Chinese austerity measures
announced early last month, and concern regarding the continuing
Anglo-Chinese stand-off over the political blueprint of Mr Chris Patten, the
governor of Hong Kong; and back is a flood of international money eager to
find reasonably valued stock markets which have expectations of high
corporate earnings growth.
'Over the next four months, I think the index will reach 8,200,' says Mr
Adrian Faure, research director at Baring Securities. 'It got to 7,500
because of strong corporate earnings, which will underpin this market. It
will hit 8,200 on announcements on the airport project, the container
terminal scheme and political agreement.'
Investors have reassured themselves that the direct impact of a slowdown in
the Chinese economy on listed companies' earnings will be minimal, since
Chinese investments will account for below 3 per cent of current year
earnings for constituent stocks of the Hang Seng index.
They are confident now that, regardless of the performance of China's
economy, the reform programme will continue unimpaired under the patronage
of Mr Zhu Rongji, vice-premier in charge of the economy.
Based on the forecasts of broker SG Warburg, the index is currently on a
1993 p/e ratio of 13.1. This remains the cheapest in south-east Asia,
compared with 15.4 for Thailand's SET index and 19 for Singapore's Straits
Times Industrial index.
In addition, although the pace of corporate earnings growth may be slowing,
it remains strong and economists expect between 16 and 17 per cent average
earnings growth in 1993 and 1994, compared with 23 per cent in 1992.
On the positive side, the Chinese have given the go-ahead for two key
projects which are part of Hong Kong's HKDollars 165bn airport plan.
This has heightened expectations that China will approve financing for the
airport.
There remain a number of concerns to suggest that the equity market will
retain its historical risk rating, leaving it as the cheapest in p/e terms
of the Asian markets.
Rumours of the death of the Chinese patriarch, Mr Deng Xiaoping, have
consistently shocked investors over the past five years. The rising profile
of the pro-reformist Mr Zhu should dampen fears of a post-Deng political
backlash; but the uncertainty resulting from Mr Deng's demise would strike a
blow to confidence.
Hong Kong has also become more sensitive to capital movements from China.
Baring Securities estimates that HKDollars 50bn in Chinese capital has
flowed into the Hong Kong property market in the last 18 months.
The austerity programme in China has focused on reining in speculative funds
within the country; if this broadened into enforced repatriation of
'speculative' capital in Hong Kong, the impact would be devastating.
However, such a move would be difficult to enforce.
Finally, Mr Patten has stated that in his opening address to the legislative
council on October 6 he wants to give some indication of progress in the
Sino-British negotiations on his political blue print for Hong Kong. An
aggressive stance would undoubtedly provoke anger from China and fear from
Hong Kong.

FT  20 AUG 93 / Money Markets: Overnight cut again
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE were signs of a small softening in European interest rates yesterday,
with France, Portugal and Finland all easing monetary policy, writes James
Blitz.
At the start of the day, the Bank of France lowered its overnight rate of
lending for the second time this week, reducing it from 8.75 per cent to
8.25 per cent.
The franc has performed quite strongly inside the reformed European exchange
rate mechanism in recent days, allowing the French authorities to ease
monetary policy without fear of endangering the currency.
The news led to a rise in French franc interest rate futures. The September
franc contract gained 8 basis points to close at 93.16, while the December
contract was up 7 at 94.28. Three-month French francs dropped sharply to
about 7.07 per cent on the bid side at the close of trading from an earlier
8.00 per cent.
A dealer suggested that one more cut in the overnight rate, to 7.75 per
cent, would be enough to trigger moves in the more internationally sensitive
official rates. He recalled that the five to 10-day lending rate was at 7.75
per cent before the recent rise to 10 per cent - and that it could soon be
lowered to that level again.
In Germany, the figures for M3 money supply growth for July had little
effect on the market, coming in below expectations at 7.5 per cent, from 7.0
per cent in June.
Dealers expected that the August figure, which would comprise heavy
intervention to support the franc, would come in a good deal higher. But
December Euromark futures were down only 4 basis points yesterday at a close
of 93.99.
Sterling futures continued to fall on the back of Wednes-day's comments from
a UK government minister that another interest rate cut should not be
anticipated.
The September short sterling contract declined 1 basis point to finish at
94.15.
Lower expectations of a rate cut were also reflected in the cash yield
curve. Although three-month money was unchanged at 5 7/8 per cent, both
six-month and one-year cash rates were slightly higher, the latter closing
at 5 7/8 per cent from a previous 5 9/16 per cent.
In the discount market there was a large shortage of Pounds 1.45bn, which
was difficult to remove. There was late assistance of Pounds 550m and the
overnight rate peaked at 7.50 per cent.

FT  20 AUG 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Yen plummets on intervention
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE YEN'S powerful rise against the dollar was dramatically reversed at the
start of US trading yesterday after the Federal Reserve intervened four
times in support of its currency, writes James Blitz.
The Fed's intervention on dollar/yen came after a long period in which
dealers had been led to believe that President Clinton's administration was
indifferent to the decline in the exchange rate, preferring to see a fall in
the Japanese trade surplus.
Both the timing and the intensity of the intervention took the market
completely by surprise and triggered one of the sharpest moves seen in an
exchange rate for a long time.
Between 15.20 and 17.30 London time, the dollar moved from Y101.70 to
Y104.50, a drop of nearly 3 per cent in the yen's value as market players
frantically squared long yen positions.
As London trading closed, the dollar's rise appeared to be showing no sign
of levelling off. Dealers said the Fed intervention was well-timed and
extremely aggressive. New York trading finished with the dollar at Y105.78.
Mr Lawrence Summers, a US Treasury Undersecretary, said yesterday that the
recent rapid rise of the yen was causing concern because exchange rate
volatility by itself could hamper world trade.
This remark was seen by one analyst as an important new indication that the
US does not want to see any further rise in the Japanese currency. However,
other analysts said the Fed's intervention may mask deeper intent.
Mr Steve Hannah, head of research at IBJ International in London, said the
Fed may have started to get concerned by the inflationary consequences of a
weak dollar.
Alternatively, a deal may have been done behind the scenes by which Japan
will give the US greater access to its markets in return for currency
support.
The results of Thursday's cabinet meeting indicate that Japan may be about
to give way to US demands on a number of issues. 'A fiscal stimulation
package is quite likely this autumn, and so is a cut in the discount rate,'
said an analyst.
European trading was dominated by another sharp rise in the value of the
French franc, which gained almost 2 centimes to finish at FFr3.495 against
the D-Mark.
Another cut in the Bank of France's overnight lending rate, this time by
1/2 percentage point, may have been one cause for the franc's rise.
But several bank dealers spoke of US hedge funds buying back the franc in
recent days in an attempt to square their positions in the wake of recent
speculation. One analyst spoke of having seen 'reasonably sized' flows from
US hedge funds yesterday.
Other currencies also profited on a day of D-Mark weakness, but sterling
lost  1/2 pfennig to DM2.5400. The dollar was nearly  1/2 pfennig up at
DM1.6865, and in New York it ended at DM1.6874.

FT  20 AUG 93 / Commodities and Agricuture: CIS offered 50% export cut in
aluminium talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE COMMONWEALTH of Independent States tentatively offered to cut its annual
aluminium exports to the European Community to about 300,000 tonnes, nearly
50 per cent below the 1992 level of 582,000 tonnes, during recent contacts
with the EC.
In contrast, European aluminium producers suggest imports should be
restricted to 80,000 tonnes - which they claim was the 'normal' level before
CIS exports began to surge in 1990. The European Commission appears to
favour a limit of 150,000 tonnes which was the annual average for the past
three years.
This was a crucial issue when the commission recently made determined
attempts to persuade the CIS industry voluntarily to restrain exports.
The commission went armed with a report of its investigation into the impact
of the unprecedented increase in CIS exports that came to the conclusion
that 'serious damage' was being done to the EC aluminium industry. It also
suggested restrictions should be imposed on CIS aluminium imports to the
community.
Having failed to reach a quick understanding with the CIS producers, the
commission on August 7 said it would limit imports of CIS aluminium to the
end of November to 60,000 tonnes. That would give the European industry some
breathing space while further negotiations took place.
The restrictions have been widely condemned, mainly because aluminium is a
global commodity and the CIS material will simply flow to other markets and
be replaced in the EC by metal from producers outside the CIS.
The commission's report warned that there were drawbacks to the EC imposing
unilateral restrictions. It said such action would 'unquestionably draw a
particularly negative reaction' from the CIS.
It also suggested that the effect on the London Metal Exchange, which sets
the world price of aluminium, would be 'unclear but limited and not
immediate'.
Also, much of the CIS aluminium was slightly below the quality required by
the LME and was therefore sold at a discount to the world price. But it
could be blended with higher-grade material and was then suitable for most
purposes. The report pointed out that the imposition of restrictions would
give a competitive advantage to producers outside the community who still
had unlimited access to this lower-priced metal.
The report also concluded that limiting imports of CIS aluminium to the EC
'only addresses one of the causes of the aluminium industry's problems. A
full solution would require that (the CIS) has more disciplined export
policies in order to restore the world balance of supply and demand.'
Although widely criticised, the EC's action does seem to be having an
effect. Russia's foreign trade ministry announced on Wednesday that it would
cut the number of organisations permitted to export metals from 132 to five
and the number allowed to export oil from 114 to nine. Ms Tatyana
Aristarkhova, adviser to Mr Sergei Glazyev, the foreign trade minister,
said: 'We had big losses of foreign revenue in the past because of a number
of incompetent exporters. This provoked all these anti-dumping campaigns
against Russia'.

A fluctuating London Metal Exchange COPPER market recovered losses in the
afternoon and the three months delivery price closed at Dollars 1,900.50 a
tonne, up Dollars 2 on the day. An early fall below Dollars 1,900 triggered
a bout of speculative selling that sent the price to Dollars 1,890. But
buyers were encouraged by continuing nearby technical tightness, which held
the cash/three months premium at just above Dollars 30 a tonne. The ZINC
market firmed by Dollars 9.50 over the day to end after hours trading at
Dollars 893.50 a tonne. Traders saw no news behind the rise and said that
after several days testing, and holding, support around the Dollars
880-a-tonne mark the market would now probably test the top end of its
Dollars 880-Dollars 900 trading range. NICKEL staged a correction to recent
lows and three months bounced to Dollars 4,740 before ending at Dollars
4,725 a tonne, up Dollars 55. At the London Commodity Exchange robusta
COFFEE futures finished mostly lower with light profit-taking emerging after
the market's recent rapid rise. The November position closed at Dollars
1,212 a tonne, down Dollars 3 on the day and dealers said there was scope
for further falls with the market still overbought.

FT  20 AUG 93 / Commodities and Agricuture: NZ dairy farmers face
disappointing market returns
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY HALL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WELLINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A SHARP fall in the prices on some international dairy markets in recent
weeks has cast doubt on the New Zealand Dairy Board's ability to meet this
season's target payout to farmers.
In May Mr Dryden Spring, the board's chairman, told dairy farmers, in his
traditional pre season message, that a payout of NZDollars 5.50 (Pounds 2)
per kilogram of milk fat was likely in the year to June 30, 1994. Mr
Spring's forecasts are usually cautious, being designed to help farmers plan
for the coming year, but this time he appears to have been over-optimistic,
a board official indicated yesterday.
The May statement was made at a time when the industry was in a buoyant mood
following last season's Dollars 5.65 payout, to which was added various
dairy company payments of up to NZDollars 1 per kilogram, giving some
farmers record returns.
But the market situation has not lived up to expectations. The price for
butter has stayed in the doldrums, and there has been a sharp weakening in
the value of whole milk powder.
Much of the present problem centres on currency difficulties, which are
inhibiting trade in most dairy commodities except cheese, the official said.
Of particular concern is the fall in European currencies against the US
dollar, in which much of the world's dairy trade is carried out, and this
situation has been worseed by the recent strong rise in the value of the New
Zealand dollar against the US currency.
The board has warned farmers that the high level of optimism in the New
Zealand industry, which is leading to high prices for both stock and
farmland, does not take account of what it hopes will be short term
pressures in the international market.
The official said it was unlikely that there would be an early lift in
butter prices and there were question marks over the price for milk powder,
of which New Zealand hopes to sell 320,000 tonnes abroad this season, twice
the amount produced just four years ago. He said that demand for New Zealand
cheese was holding up well, adding: 'It really is the glamour product of the
moment. . .World demand for cheese - especially the consistent type New
Zealand produces - is growing strongly'.
He pointed out that there were few convenience foods that did not rely on
cheese to some extent - whether they be pizzas, McDonald's cheeseburgers or
Mexican or pasta dishes. In addition there was a strong demand from
manufacturers of TV dinners and the like.
The official said that the effects of the sharp drop in international butter
and milk powder prices would have been much more severe a decade ago, when
New Zealand produced a relatively narrow range of commodities in bulk form.
Now about 70 per cent of the country's dairy products were exported in
consumer-ready form, he said, which helped to 'soften the blow' of ups and
downs in the international market.

'not enough'

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A PACKAGE of mining incentives recommended for approval by Philipines
president Fidel Ramos were welcome but not enough, a Chamber of Mines
official said yesterday, reports Reuter from Manila.
He said that the easing of a constitutional rule limiting foreign investors
to 40 per cent ownership in mining ventures would help, as would early
approval by congress of a mining code with measures designed to attract
foreign investment.
The new mining code should give foreign investors 'more elbow room' to
acquire 100 per cent ownership in mining ventures for a certain number of
years, he added.
But the official noted that mining companies had described as short-sighted
the Finance Department's refusal to reduce value added tax payments by
mining companies. 'If the rate is reduced to 2 per cent from 5 per cent, we
can use the money to expand and create more jobs. That will bring in more
taxes later,' he explained.
The Bureau of Mines should also be strengthened and should not remain within
the Environment Department where it is finding it difficult to help the
mining industry, he added.

FT  20 AUG 93 / Commodities and Agricuture: Mexican oil giant profits from
private tuition - Commercial contractors are showing Pemex how to cut costs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OFF THE south-east coast of Mexico in the Sound of Campeche a group of
foreign and private Mexican oil companies is drilling for oil. The companies
man their own rigs, lease or own their equipment and operate independently
of the company to which they are contracted, Petroleos Mexicanos (Pemex),
the country's state oil corporation.
In the nearest on-shore town, Ciudad del Carmen, property prices have soared
as new residents have looked for homes; local entrepreneurs have set up
video bars and a Kentucky Fried Chicken outlet to cash in on the boom; and
rich, rowdy foreign oil workers have upset local sensibilities.
After being closed to foreign oil drillers since the early 1970s, Mexico is
now opening up. Private - and thus foreign - companies still cannot explore
for oil and take a cut of what they find, but they are doing drilling work
for Pemex on a contract or turnkey basis. Of about 60 wells in the Bay of
Campeche, 36 are being drilled by private oil companies, at a cost to Pemex
of between Dollars 300m and 400m.
While the government is unlikely before next year's presidential election to
modify Mexico's nationalist constitution to permit foreign oil companies to
explore for oil, some further relaxation is expected eventually.
'This is not the end of the trend toward opening,' says Mr Rafael Quijano,
an expert on Pemex at the Petroleum Finance Corporation in Washington.
'Quite the contrary; it is the beginning.'
Pemex recently allowed a private consortium headed by Valero Energy of Texas
to build, operate and own a gasoline plant in Mexico for the first time, and
has taken a 50 per cent stake in Shell's refinery at Deer Park, Texas. It
had also put up secondary petrochemicals plants for sale, although this has
now been postponed for the foreseeable future because of low petrochemical
prices.
In an indication of possible changes ahead, the government has drawn up
draft legislation that would allow private companies to use Pemex pipes to
import oil, according to a report cited in the El Financiero newspaper. Such
legislation, if passed by to congress, would break Pemex's 55-year-old
monopoly of the distribution of oil in Mexico.
The partial opening of the sector to foreign contractors has already had an
effect on how Pemex does business. Thanks to their greater nimbleness and
efficiency, private contractors take half as much time to drill a well as
the state company, according to Mr Ernesto Marcos, its finance director. So
contracting out has saved Pemex huge sums in drilling costs, as well as
teaching it lessons that it has used to improve its own operations.
'We are not willing to follow examples of pre-cooked dinners (on the rigs),'
says Mr Marcos, referring to Mexican distaste for American frozen food, 'but
we certainly follow other practices of the private companies.' He points out
that Pemex has substantially de-centralised procurement, allowing rigs to
buy equipment directly from suppliers, rather than through the Mexico City
headquarters, which often entailed months of delay.
The private drillers are generally American, Mexican or joint-ventures
between the two. So far of the 36 wells contracted out, most have been to
four companies - Triton International of Houston, Faja de Oro and Protexa,
both Mexican, but contracting work out to foreigners, and a joint Mexican-US
owned company, EPN-Sonat.
They operate on a turnkey basis, drilling a given depth for a specified sum
before handing over the well to Pemex, which brings it into production, and
take all financial risk in case drilling proves more difficult than
expected. Generally they make do without the large numbers of cooks, waiters
and other excess staff seen on the Pemex wells and have an average basic
crew of 32 to 35, compared with 42 at Pemex operations.
Apart from personnel, the main difference between the private companies and
Pemex is in logistical and managerial expertise, rather than technology. One
oil man in Campeche explains: 'Pemex's main problem is not that they don't
have good people in the field. Its the ponderous organisation above that.
They have to go to six or eight people to make a decision, whereas I can
make one there and then'.
Mr Marcos thoroughly agrees. 'Before, we had to co-ordinate people in
drilling with people in procurement with people in transportation. You can
never structure yourself in a company this size so that such co-ordination
is efficient.' The lack of co-ordination caused delays in drilling, pushing
up Pemex's costs.
So convinced is the company of the benefits of contracting out that Mr
Marcos claims it is now ahead of most international oil companies in the
proportion of drilling work it gives out on a turn-key basis. Pemex will
continue to drill a few of its own wells, he says, but only to keep abreast
of technological developments.
The main limit on such contract work is Pemex's own budget rather than lack
of oil to be taken out. The Sound of Campeche is rich in oil, producing 1.9m
barrels a day of Mexico total of 2.67m b/d last year. Its extraction costs
are among the lowest in the world, and were there were more funds, further
investment in exploration and drilling would be justified, says Mr Marcos.
But although the government tells Pemex to operate as a commercial company,
it sets its budget according to political criteria. The company is under
instructions to meet growing demand for oil and maintain exports at current
levels of about 1.37m b/d, rather than to maximise profits.

harvest of more than 50m tonnes, the Ukrinform news agency said yesterday,
reports Reuter from Kiev.
An earlier official forecast had put the harvest at up to 44m tonnes,
compared with last year's 39m-40m tonnes.
Ukrinform said Mr Karasyk's forecast was made on Wednesday to a meeting of
farm chiefs in Kiev.
The minister estimated general grain yields at 3.5 tonnes a hectare, with
wheat yields rising to more than four tonnes a hectare. Given such a
harvest, he said, state orders would total between 15m and 17m tonnes, well
above requirements. 'We have every possibility not only of eliminating
purchases of foreign grain, but even of selling it,' he said. 'This applies
particularly to wheat. There is even a possibility of exporting seed.'
Ukraine last year imported small amounts of grain, mainly for animal feed.
The Itar-Tass news agency quoted Ukraine's ambassador in Moscow, Mr Vladimir
Kryzhanovsky, as saying the country had such a good grain harvest this year
that it was considering the possibility of paying off its debt for Russian
energy supplies with 5m tonnes of grain exports.
Kiev owes Moscow about Dollars 1bn for energy supplies.
As of August 9, the Russian harvest of grains and pulses (excluding maize)
was behind last year, slowed by a lack of fuel and machinery, according to a
US agricultural attache, reports Reuter from Washington.
However, yields have shown a significant improvement over last season, the
attache wrote in a field report filed from Moscow. Grain crops had been cut
and threshed on about half as much area compared with that time last year.
Sales to state resources were slower than last year, hindered by
disagreements between farmers and the government over prices, the report
said.

FT  20 AUG 93 / Government Bonds: US Treasuries reach new highs on surprise
trade data
</HEADLINE>

AN UNEXPECTEDLY wide June trade deficit and strong demand for longer-dated
securities pushed US Treasury prices to new highs yesterday.
In late trading the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  3/4 at 100,
yielding 6.197 per cent. At the short end of the market, the two-year note
was  3/32 firmer at 100 5/8 , to yield 3.896 per cent.
Technical factors, including a shortage of 30-year bonds which was squeezing
prices higher, continued to sustain the long end of the market. Bonds were
also aided by strong demand from investors seeking longer duration on their
portfolios.
The day's economic news, a widening in the merchandise trade deficit for
June to Dollars 12.1bn, up from Dollars 8.4bn, was also bullish for market
sentiment.
The deficit, the widest since October 1987, was primarily the result of a
sharp fall in exports, and indicated that the economy continues to weaken.
Analysts said the deficit data suggested that second quarter real gross
domestic product growth would have to be revised downward.
JAPANESE government bonds were sold off sharply in London trading as the yen
slid against the US dollar, dampening any hopes of a cut in Japanese
interest rates.
The Japanese government bond market closed lower in Tokyo, and then
continued to tumble in London trad-ing.
The yield on the bench-mark No 145, which started the day at 4.095 per cent
in Tokyo, closed at 4.125 per cent in Japan and then rose further in London
to 4.19 per cent.
Mr Yasushi Mieno, governor of the Bank of Japan, emphasised on Wednesday
that there were no plans to cut the Official Discount Rate. However, any
remaining hopes of an easing evaporated in the course of yesterday as the
yen weakened against the US currency and many investors decided to take
profits.
There had already been rumours that a big Middle Eastern investor was
selling Japanese government bonds, which depressed the market, but dealers
said the selling pressure became more intense as the US Federal Reserve
bought dollars against the yen.
ATTENTION in the European government bond markets focused largely on Germany
and the Bundesbank's much-awaited announcement of the M3 money supply
figures.
German M3 money supply grew at an annualised rate of 7.5 per cent in July,
against 7.0 per cent in June.
Although the July figure was well outside the Bundesbank's stated target
range of 4.5 to 6.5 per cent, it was below market expectations and the bund
market initially greeted the news with a sigh of relief.
Economists had forecast a high M3 money supply figure for July on the
grounds that it would be distorted by the recent intervention, related to
the crisis in the European exchange rate mechanism at the end of July.
However, the market subsequently sold off when the Bundesbank said that the
effects of intervention would appear in next month's money supply figures
instead.
As a result, the market's hopes of an interest rate cut at the Bundesbank
council meeting next Thursday were severely dampened.
The Liffe bund futures contract slipped from Wednesday's close of 97.22 to
end at around 97.17 yesterday, having traded to a 97.34 high.
UK government bonds fell up to  3/4 of a point at the long end as investors
took profits after the market's substantial rally. Dealers said the market
is still mulling over comments made by Mr Michael Portillo on Wednesday,
which appeared to rule out the chance of an imminent cut in the base rate.

FT  20 AUG 93 / International Bonds: Borrowers move early to beat the
September rush
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE international bond market was active yesterday as borrowers sought to
beat the traditional rush for funds at the start of September.
Syndicate managers said they expected further offerings in the coming week
since many borrowers were asking banks to bid for mandates. 'The markets are
in great shape and investor demand is good,' said one syndicate manager.
Yesterday's offerings came in a variety of currencies. The Bank for Dutch
Municipalities raised Fl 1bn in two equal tranches, one with a seven-year
maturity which appealed more to international investors, and the other with
a 15-year maturity which was aimed at the domestic market.
Lead manager ABN Amro Bank said that the issuer had chosen those maturities
because the 10-year area of the yield curve was out of favour with
investors.
Foreign borrowers are not expected to tap the Dutch market in the near
future because of the lack of opportunities to swap the proceeds into other
currencies.
SNCF, the French state railway, established a new benchmark in the French
bond market with its FFr3bn, 20-year issue. An official at the lead manager,
Societe Generale, said investor demand for long-dated bonds enabled SNCF to
achieve favourable terms.
The issue's relatively tight pricing was offset by the generous discount.
Many French long-dated bonds are trading at a substantial premium.
SNCF's bonds, which have a coupon of 6 3/4 per cent, were priced to yield 18
basis points above the 8 1/2 per cent French government OAT bond due
December 2012. When the bonds were freed to trade, the spread tightened
slightly.
Another large issue was launched in the sterling market as Woolwich Building
Society raised Pounds 200m through an offering of five-year Eurobonds. The
five-year area is seen to be the cheapest part of the yield curve for
borrowers.
CSFB, the lead manager, said there was a lot of demand for the bonds outside
the UK. The bonds were priced to yield 65 basis points over the 7 1/4 per
cent UK government bond due 1998. When the bonds were freed to trade they
were quoted at 99.47, below their re-offer price of 99.57, reflecting the
weaker UK market.
Sweden raised L200bn through an issue of 10-year Eurobonds, encouraged by
the success of Rabobank's Eurolira offering on Wednesday. Sweden's deal was
more generous than the Dutch bank's, reflecting its lower credit rating. The
proceeds of the deal were understood to have been swapped into floating-rate
lire.
Halifax Building Society made its first public offering in the Swiss franc
market, raising SFr150m through an issue of five-year bonds. The bonds were
quoted at less 1.75 bid, from an issue price of 102.3. The Halifax said the
proceeds had been swapped into sterling.
Banca Nazionale del Lavoro chose the dollar sector for its first Eurobond
offering since 1990.
Moody's, the US credit rating agency, took the bank off its Creditwatch list
last week and affirmed the bank's rating of A2.

FT  20 AUG 93 / International Capital Markets: Bulis to be made more
attractive by Bundesbank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bundesbank yesterday announced reforms to the bidding arrangements for
Bulis - short-term money market instruments introduced earlier this year in
an attempt to soak up excess liquidity created by the relaxation of minimum
reserve requirements for bank lending.
The reforms are designed to make the new instruments more effective in
mopping up liquidity outside the banking sector. The German central bank,
which yesterday launched a new DM8.5bn tranche of 'Bulis', said it was
dissatisfied because the bulk of the DM24bn of Bulis issued so far had been
taken up by banks and foreign institutions.
Under the reforms, non-banks - a category which embraces industrial
corporations as well as insurance companies - will be able to bid for the
new securities direct through the Landeszentralbanken, the Bundesbank's
regional branch network. They will no longer be obliged to buy the
securities through banks.
The minimum denomination is being raised from DM100,000 to DM500,000. Mr
Johann Wilhelm Gaddum, a Bundesbank director, explained that this was
designed to make the instruments more attractive to non-banks which had held
back out of fear of competing with private investors.
He said that only 10 per cent of the Bulis issued so far had ended up in the
non-bank sector, while foreign investors - including central banks - held
just over 50 per cent and the banking community the rest. This was
disappointing because a central reason for introducing the Bulis was to give
the Bundesbank a degree of direct control over liquidity outside the banking
sector.
'The aim is to strengthen Bulis as an instrument of monetary policy,' Mr
Gaddum said. This reflects the central bank's concerns about growth in money
supply growth, regarded as a determinant of future inflation.
Economists said the move could strengthen German money-markets, which are
under-developed by the standards of other financial centres as the
availability of short-term money-market instruments is limited.
The new Bulis will be issued in two tranches with maturities of three and
six months, replacing Bulis maturing on September 3. The terms will set by
the tender. The Bundesbank said it intends to replace all Bulis maturing
from December onwards with regular six-month maturities.

FT  20 AUG 93 / International Capital Markets: Novel D-Mark warrants on
Portuguese bonds set
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BANKERS Trust yesterday launched the first offering of warrants on
Portuguese government bonds hedged into D-Marks.
The 2m warrants were targeted primarily at German, Swiss and French-based
investors. Despite strong demand for high-yielding European bonds, many
investors have been deterred from buying Portuguese paper because of the
foreign exchange risk. The structure of the warrants, known as 'quanto'
warrants, means that there is no exposure to the escudo, since the warrants
are hedged into D-Marks at a rate of Es102.12.
Many investors are also wary of the Portuguese bond market's illiquidity,
having suffered heavy losses in last summer's currency turbulence. Warrants
allow investors to participate in the market at a limited cost.
The call warrants cost DM3.75 each and give holders the right to buy the 11
7/8 per cent OT (Portuguese government bond) due April 2000 at a set price
of 109.95. The warrants can be exercised only on one day, May 19 1994.

FT  20 AUG 93 / International Company News: Mattel, Fisher-Price to merge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MATTEL, the second-biggest US toy maker, yesterday took a step towards
challenging Hasbro's dominance of the toy industry by announcing a merger
with Fisher-Price, a leading maker of pre-school and infant toys, in a
stock-swap which values Fisher-Price at about Dollars 1bn.
Under the terms of the definitive agreement, which has been approved by the
boards of both companies, each share of Fisher-Price common stock will be
exchanged on a tax-free basis for 1.275 shares of Mattel common stock. The
merger will be accounted for as a pooling of interests.
Mattel has overcome an extremely volatile past in the 1970s and 1980s to
become one of the strongest US toy companies, due largely to the performance
of its three core toy-lines - Barbie, Hot Wheels and Disney-licensed
products. But the company has fallen short of being a rival to Hasbro, the
Goliath of the toy industry with a diverse product line, including
Playskool, Batman and Nerf products.
Mattel had 1992 sales of Dollars 1.85bn, compared with Hasbro's revenues of
Dollars 2.54bn. In the same period, Fisher-Price had revenues of Dollars
694m.
Fisher-Price, whose lines include Chatter Telephone, Play Desk and a wide
range of playsets, was spun off by Quaker Oats and became publicly traded in
1991. Its performance has improved since the spin-off, but it posted a loss
in the first quarter this year and has struggled under high costs and
operating leverage.
The possibility of a merger between Mattel and Fisher-Price has been touted
for years. At the time of the spin-off, Mattel confirmed it had approached
Quaker and expressed interest in a possible Fisher-Price transaction.
Shares of Fisher-Price shot up Dollars 5 1/8 to Dollars 29 in light
after-hours trading, Reuter reports from New York. At the end of
regular-hours trading, before the merger was announced, Fisher-Price closed
at Dollars 23 7/8 . Mattel closed unchanged at Dollars 25 5/8 .

FT  20 AUG 93 / International Company News: Hang Seng Bank disappoints
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HANG SENG Bank, the Hong Kong banking subsidiary of HSBC, disappointed
market expectations yesterday by announcing a 17.5 per cent rise in
first-half net profit to HKDollars 2.75bn (USDollars 354.8m), up from
HKDollars 2.34bn in 1992.
The figures included a HKDollars 258.9m exceptional profit from the sale of
Wing On Bank.
Excluding this one-off profit, net earnings grew by only 6 per cent.
However, the bank would not say whether the figures included any provision
against its exposure to Olympia and York, the troubled Canadian property
company.
HSBC Holdings operates the largest retail banking presence in Hong Kong, and
owns 61.5 per cent of Hang Seng.
Hang Seng's earnings were significantly below analysts' forecasts, but they
reflect slower loan growth in Hong Kong and increasing competition for
deposits.
One analyst said: 'It has been bankers' heaven in Hong Kong for the past two
years. We are finally returning to a more normal banking environment.' Last
year, net interest margins reached peak levels.
Hang Seng Bank has a negative outlook for earnings in the near-term future,
as a result of its forecast of a slow economic recovery in the US and
Europe, and the impact on Hong Kong of China's austerity measures.
'The impact under this scenario would likely be felt towards the latter part
of the year and possibly in 1994, leading to further slackening in exports,
investment and domestic spending,' the company said in its official
statement.
The directors recommended an interim dividend of 50 cents a share, up 16 per
cent on 1992's 43 cent payout.

quarter

<TEXT>
SONY, the consumer electronics group, suffered a 36 per cent per cent drop
in first-quarter consolidated operating income to Y25.3bn (Dollars 249.3m)
as a result of weak demand in its main markets and the strength of the yen.
The company blamed slow demand for most of its main products, from
camcorders, to televisions in major markets, particularly Europe and Japan,
as well as the rapid appreciation of the yen against the US dollar which
reduced sharply its overseas revenues.
Sony's disappointing performance came as sales fell 10 per cent to Y828.7bn
from Y924.4bn. Net income was almost halved to Y7.7bn from Y14.9bn.
However, income before taxes rose 31 per cent to Y38.6bn from Y29.5bn,
largely as a result of a foreign exchange gain of Y20.4bn.
Sony revised its forecast for the year to March 1994 in view of the
persistent weakness of demand and the rapid rise of the yen. Consolidated
sales are forecast to fall 7 per cent to Y3,720bn compared with a previous
forecast of sales 2 per cent lower at Y3,910bn. The forecast for pre-tax
profits was unchanged at Y87bn, or 6 per cent down on the previous year.
On a parent company basis, Sony forecasts a 6 per cent fall in sales to
Y1,760bn and a 30 per cent decline in pre-tax profits to Y32bn.
Operating profits, however, are forecast to rise 29 per cent to Y2bn, in
part as a result of cost-cutting measures. Sony's cost of sales in the first
quarter were down nearly 10 per cent from Y663.5bn to Y598.4bn.
The company plans to increase the ratio of products manufactured outside of
Japan for sale in overseas markets from the current 35 per cent to 50 per
cent by about 1997.
In product areas, Sony was particularly hit by depressed demand for
audio-visual equipment, including camcorders and CD players. The Japanese
market is seeing its fourth year of decline in demand for audio-visual
products.
Sony Pictures, meanwhile, suffered a 16 per cent fall in sales in local
currency terms due to a lack of box-office hits.

CANADIAN AIRLINES claims Air Canada's CDollars 200m cash offer for its
international routes is intended to block a key August 27 vote on Canadian's

Mr Rhys Eyton, chairman of Canadian and its parent PWA, said the timing of
this week's offer, which includes assumption of CDollars 800m (USDollars
625m) in debt and aircraft lease obligations, comes a week before debenture
holders and shareholders of Canadian vote on the restructuring.
Three foreign banks have raised objections to the plan and Mr Eyton
acknowledged that Air Canada's offer might sway some creditors.
American Airlines's CDollars 246m cash infusion depends on creditors'
acceptance and Canadian's exit from the Gemini reservation system. The
Gemini issue is before the courts, but a new Canadian offer of CDollars
21.5m to withdraw and join American's Sable system has been rejected by
Gemini.
Air Canada says Canadian cannot withdraw under its contract until 1999.

THE Quebec government has retained Goldman Sachs, the New York investment
bank, to help evaluate Sidbec-Dosco, a steelmaker with about 1.5m tonnes
annual capacity that it indirectly owns, writes Robert Gibbens in Montreal.
The government has been trying to privatise Sidbec for several years, but
the company has been losing money because of the recession. Its basic steel
plant near Montreal is modern but the rolling and finishing operations need
more investment.
CAI Capital, an investment firm headed by Mr David Culver, retired chairman
of Alcan Aluminium, jointly with a union investment fund has made a
tentative bid for Sidbec. The government says the private sector can run
Sidbec best, but any buyer must provide for new investment.

<TEXT>
CHEUNG KONG, the flagship of Mr Li Ka-shing's listed Hong Kong empire,
announced net profit of HKDollars 4.53bn (Dollars 591m) for the six months
to June 1993; almost double the 1991 figure of HKDollars 2.35bn.
The results exceeded stock market expectations, primarily as a result of an
exceptional profit of HKDollars 708m on the 220m covered warrants issued by
Cheung Kong in 1991 against its holding in Hutchison Whampoa.
The company also benefited from a substantial increase in profits from
associated companies, which contributed HKDollars 3.28bn, compared with
HKDollars 306m in 1992.
That reflected the turn-around of 42 per cent-owned Hutchison Whampoa, as
well as contributions from a number of partly-owned property developments,
which included Kingswood Villas and Laguna City.
Cheung Kong took significant steps to build up its diminishing Hong Kong
land bank during the first half of the year.
It finalised agreements to develop a 162,000 sq metre luxury housing estate
with the Pacific Concord Group, and a 209,150 sq metre commercial and
residential project with Mainland group China Resources.
Mr Li predicted that Hong Kong property prices, which have risen steeply
this year, would stabilise in the second half of 1993, but that sales levels
would remain high.
The directors announced an interim dividend of 24 cents a share, up from 20
cents a share in 1992.

<TEXT>
JAPAN'S ministry of finance yesterday disciplined Cosmo Securities, a second
tier broker which faces extraordinary losses of Y69.8bn (Dollars 682m), by
ordering a suspension of corporate business operations.
The company announced last week it had a negative net worth of Y7.1bn due to
losses stemming from tobashi deals, where clients' accounts are shuffled to
hide unrealised losses. Daiwa Bank will rescue Cosmo by a share purchase,
becoming the country's first bank to hold a stockbroking subsidiary.
The ministry ordered that Cosmo suspend operations of certain corporate
businesses from next Monday to September 3. Cosmo announced a pay cut for
its executives for three months from September. Mr Hiroshi Nakano, Cosmo's
president, takes a 30 per cent cut. Other board members face cuts of between
15 and 20 per cent.
The ministry of finance is investigating the country's 48 brokers for other
concealed cases of irregular dealings. Officials claim that Cosmo was
unrepresentative, but analysts believe more cases may be uncovered.
The scale of the problems confronting the Japanese brokerage industry was
highlighted yesterday as Yamaichi Securities said it was considering a
rescue of Yamaichi Finance, an ailing non-bank finance affiliate. Yamaichi's
bailout will follow Nomura Securities, which last month announced a
restructuring of its property lending affiliate, and Daiwa Securities, whose
finance affiliates hold mounting bad loans.
Most Japanese brokerages set up non-bank financial affiliates during the
late 1980s, extending loans on stock and land collateral. Many loans have
turned bad as a result of plunging land and stock prices. That has also
eroded the collateral at the finance companies.
Some Y180bn of Yamaichi Finance's Y370bn loan portfolio is seen as
non-performing, and the company's unrealised losses of its collateral totals
about Y80bn.

HUTCHISON Whampoa, Hong Kong's largest conglomerate, yesterday announced a
strong turnround in interim earnings, with net profit of HKDollars 2.52bn
(USDollars 325.2m) for the six months to June, compared with a loss of
HKDollars 76m in the same period in 1992.
The greatest impetus for the increase was the performance of 49 per
cent-owned Canadian oil and gas company Husky, which suffered substantial
losses during 1992 and forced a provision of HKDollars 1.42bn at the interim
stage. Mr Li Ka-shing, chairman, said Husky contributed a profit in the
first half of 1991.
The group's core businesses also performed strongly. Turnover rose to
HKDollars 11.52bn and operating profit was up 22 per cent to HKDollars
2.47bn.
Hong Kong International Terminals, the 61 per cent-owned port operator, saw
a 22 per cent increase in container throughput during the period, and
profits were boosted by lower interest and depreciation charges. Hutchison's
port operations in Zhuhai, in China's Pearl River delta, and Felixstowe, in
the UK, also reported profit increases.
There were strong contributions from property sales, particularly from the
group's 50 per cent-owned South Horizons development.
The group's telecommunications ambitions continued to sap earnings. Mr Li
said: 'Losses incurred by the group's overseas telecommunications interests
have offset to a large extent the profits generated by the group's
successful telecommunications businesses in Hong Kong.'
The company is expected to make provisions of around HKDollars 600m against
its lossmaking Rabbit CT2 telepoint business in the UK during the second
half of the year. However, this will be offset by an extraordinary profit of
HKDollars 1.5bn from Hutchison's recent sale of 32 per cent of its stake in
Star Television.
Mr Li said Hutchison would continue to expand into China, despite the
current austerity programme. 'The group is well-positioned to participate in
suitable property, power plant, container terminal and retail projects in
China, which reflect the group's expertise in its existing core businesses,'
he said.
The directors declared an interim dividend of 19 cents a share, compared
with 16 cents a share in 1992.

TEXAS INSTRUMENTS yesterday announced plans to build one of the world's
largest semiconductor plants in Dallas, Texas. Construction will begin this
year. The plant is expected to cost between Dollars 750m (Pounds 506m) and
Dollars 1bn during the next five years.
TI is the fourth US chip maker to announce plans for big new plants this
year.
In April, Intel, the world's largest chipmaker, said that it would build a
Dollars 1bn addition to its factory in New Mexico.
Advanced Micro Devices followed in July, saying its next plant, to be built
in Texas, would cost between Dollars 750m and Dollars 1bn. Motorola is
putting a Dollars 1bn investment into a Texas plant that will combine
research and production.
These investments reflect booming demand for semiconductor chips. Worldwide
sales are expected to increase by more than 20 per cent this year to about
Dollars 80bn.
They also signal the rising strength of US manufacturers. Japanese
semiconductor producers, who outspent their US competitors in the 1980s,
have now been overtaken by US producers.
US semiconductor industry capital expenditures are projected to increase by
37 per cent to more than Dollars 5.5bn this year, accord-ing to Integrated
Circuit Engineering, a US market research firm.
Japanese companies plan to spend Dollars 4.2bn on new plants and equipment,
an increase of 2 per cent on last year.
Capital spending by the European semiconductor industry is expected to total
about Dollars 1.1bn, up 6 per cent.
The cost of new semiconductor production plants has escalated during the
past few years, total costs rising from about Dollars 250m in 1990 to nearly
Dollars 1bn today.
Much of the increase is due to more sophisticated production equipment.
Only the world's largest semiconductor producers can now afford to keep
pace. By the end of the century there may be fewer than a dozen
state-of-the-art chip factories in the world, industry executives predict.
Texas Instruments' expansion plans are typical. The company's new Dallas
facility will be built in two phases, construction of the first phase
beginning immediately, followed by an expansion that will more than double
the size of the plant.
When it reaches full production in 1998, the plant will employ about 550
people, TI said. The new plant will eventually produce chips as small as
0.12microns, or 800 times smaller than the diameter of a human hair - about
one quarter the size of today's most advanced chips.

FT  20 AUG 93 / International Company News: Unitas unveils plan for capital
injections
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
UNITAS, Finland's second-largest banking group, yesterday unveiled plans to
strengthen its capital base by raising nearly FM1.5bn (Dollars 258m) in new
equity, and up to a further Dollars 150m of preference capital from
international markets.
It said the funds would enable it to withstand two more years of losses, and
give it the capacity to expand lending when the Finnish economy recovered.
'If we are successful, we have every reason to believe that we will not fall
into state hands,' said Mr Markku Pohjola, the bank's senior vice-president.
The Finnish government said yesterday it had agreed in principle to
guarantee new preference capital issues by both the Union Bank of Finland
(part of Unitas) and Kansallis-Osake-Pankki, Finland's leading commercial
bank. The KOP guarantee covers an issue of up to FM1.8bn and the UBF
guarantee an issue of up to FM1bn.
Unitas says it aims to raise FM1.16bn through a one-for-three rights issue
at FM10 per share, and a further FM300m through an issue open to both
shareholders and non-shareholders.
The timing of the offers has been aided by evidence of recovery in the wider
Nordic banking sector. This has helped Unitas' share price rise by more than
50 per cent, to FM20 in the last three weeks.
The group is being cautious about its prospects, saying it may not show a
clear profit until 1996. However, it believes its 1993 loss will be lower
than last year's FM2.7bn deficit, helped by a levelling off of credit losses
and non-performing loans. In the first seven months of the year, its loss
fell to FM923m from FM1.02bn.
The bank's capital adequacy ratio at the end of July stood at 11.1 per cent.
However, it will rise to more than 13 per cent if its fund-raising plans are
successful.

DEN DANSKE BANK, the largest Danish bank, reports pre-tax profits of
DKr2.37bn (Dollars 344m) for the first six months of 1993, compared with
DKr6m in the first half of 1992.
The turnround is almost entirely due to increased net interest income
following a steep rise in international money market activity.
Earnings from net interest and fees rose 12 per cent, to DKr5.29bn, and
there was a net valuation gain of DKr1.45bn on securities and other
financial instruments, compared with a DKr199m loss in the first half of
1992.
The profit from core banking activities was also up, rising by more than 50
per cent to DKr919m. Both the Danish and international branch networks
contributed to the improvements. Mr Knud Soensen, chief executive, described
this as encouraging, but not yet satisfactory considering Den Danske's
substantial equity capital.
Income from traditional deposit-taking and lending rose only modestly.
Operating expenses and depreciation were trimmed by 8 per cent, to
DKr3.27bn, as the staff reduction programme started last year gathered pace.
Bad debt provision was increased to DKr1.41bn from DKr1.04bn. The bank said
small- and medium-sized businesses were having a particularly difficult
time, although personal customers were doing a little better.
Mr Soensen warned of lower profits in the current half, anticipating less
activity on the money markets. Expenses were also likely to rise.
He said group profits would be particularly affected by the levels of bond
and share prices at the end of year.

ITALY'S Ferruzzi family, staggering under the financial problems of the
Ferruzzi Finanziaria (Ferfin) holding company it controls, has sold a small
Louisiana bank. The sale is the first of what may be numerous disposals to
raise cash and cut borrowings.
Alerion Bank, based in New Orleans, has been acquired by Louisiana's Premier
Bancorp for Dollars 47m. The deal will bolster the depleted coffers of the
Ferruzzi family and provide a small, but welcome, cash injection into the
debt-laden Ferfin holding company.
Although 75 per cent of the bank is owned by the Ferruzzi family, almost 25
per cent is held by a Ferfin subsidiary.
With total assets of about Dollars 340m, Alerion Bank is the fifth-biggest
financial institution in New Orleans, with nine branches. Formerly called
American Bank and Trust, it first attracted the attention of Mr Serafino
Ferruzzi, the group's founder, in the late 1970s, when he took a stake. In
1988, the Ferruzzis bought full control.
Although agreed by the Ferruzzi family, the sale took place in consultation
with the five-bank committee of leading creditors now guiding Ferfin.
However, negotiations on a sale were believed to have been taking place well
before the group's recent problems came to light.
Premier Bancorp, based in Baton Rouge, is the third-biggest banking group in
Louisiana. It is controlled by the Ohio-based Banc One group, which has been
expanding rapidly through acquisitions in recent years.
Finmeccanica, the Italian state-controlled engineering group, is selling its
DEA measuring equipment unit to Brown &amp; Sharpe, the US measuring instruments
maker, in return for a 30 per cent stake in the US company.

PARIBAS, one of France's leading banking groups, plans to forge closer links
between Banque Paribas and Credit du Nord, its retail banking networks,
through a commercial co-operation agreement.
The agreement, when France's banks are trying to cut costs to counter the
recession, involves the two networks collaborating in areas such as the sale
of products to their customers, particularly to their corporate clients, and
also in the development of information technology.
Mr Andre Levy-Lang, chairman of the Paribas group, has been seeking
synergies. He has ruled out a merger in order to retain separate identities
for Banque Paribas, Credit du Nord and Compagnie Bancaire, the group's
specialist finance unit.
Banque Paribas is one of the largest players in the French investment
banking scene, with a network of 40 branches dealing mainly with corporate
accounts and wealthy private clients. Credit du Nord is a mainstream retail
banking network with 540 branches.
Paribas said yesterday that the new agreement would only affect the 'behind
the scenes' aspects of Paribas and Credit du Nord. It said that the two
networks had for three years been working more closely together. The
agreement would formalise their collaboration.
Paribas aims to sustain its recovery after returning to the black with a net
profit of FFr886m in 1992 following its first loss in 1991.

WALT DISNEY, the US entertainment group, plans to expand its animated film
production following the box office success of Aladdin, its latest feature,
which has grossed more than Dollars 212m in North America.
The company, which last month reported a Dollars 30.9m quarterly loss on its
investment in the Euro Disney theme park near Paris, said it intended to
produce two feature-length animated films a year at studios in California
and Florida.
Mr Max Howard, vice-president of Walt Disney Animation in Florida, said
yesterday the decision 'represents a move back into film-making'.
Although the company expects to make further losses on Euro Disney in the
fourth quarter, Mr Howard denied it was hoping to capitalise on increased
box office demand to offset losses at the theme park.
'We're just maximising every part of our business,' he said. 'Expectations
at Euro Disney have been too short-term. We've built a city there with a
huge infrastructure. The returns will be in the future.'
Mr Howard said the films would be funded by revenue from Aladdin - due to be
released in Europe later this year - and Beauty and the Beast, which has
earned more than Dollars 147m in the US and Pounds 94m (Dollars 140m) in the
UK since 1991.
Walt Disney, which is seeking artists in Europe because of a shortage of US
animators, said new recruits would work on The Hunchback of Notre Dame and
Pocahontas, both scheduled for release in 1995.
Last year's sterling devaluation had made the UK a more attractive location,
Mr Howard said, but the company was more likely to set up a European studio
in France.

FT  20 AUG 93 / International Company News: Mannesmann slides into deficit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
MANNESMANN, the diversified engineering group and a recent favourite with
investors during the rally in the German stock market, yesterday reported a
group net loss of DM467m (Dollars 278m) for the first six months of the
year. The result is a huge swing from a profit of DM15m in the first six
months of 1992.
Mannesmann suffered losses in all divisions, hit by the combined effects of
recession in German, the impact of a stronger D-Mark on group exports, and
the costs of rationalisation measures in a number of its main industrial
sectors.
The result was worse than expected, and the shares dropped DM8.30 to close
at DM333.20.
The group said first-half losses were worst in its car components division
and in its pipes and tubes activities, the group's traditional core
business.
In both cases, trading losses were compounded by restructuring costs. In
addition, weak sales and prices hit the machinery and industrial plant
division.
Total group turnover rose fractionally, from DM12.82bn to DM12.87bn in the
six months, while group orders dropped 6 per cent to DM14.1bn. The group
forecast that turnover for the full year would reach the same level as last
year, but that orders would not.
Although there was little evidence of improvement in business conditions for
the rest of the year, Mannesmann nonetheless sounded an optimistic note
about the future.
It said rationalisation - the positive effects of which were not felt in the
interim figures - would lead to a permanent lowering of the group's
break-even point without the necessity to reduce the number of products on
offer. Over the past year, the number of employees in the group has fallen
from 142,827 to 131,164 at the end of June.
In a letter to shareholders, chief executive Mr Werner Dieter was confident
about the D2 mobile telephone system, the first private network in Germany.
Development has cost the company DM4.5bn to date. However, Mannesmann said
the project was set to start making profits early next year, and that the
system already had nearly 300,000 subscribers, ahead of expectations.
Mannesmann shares have outperformed the rising German stock market by 13 per
cent since the beginning of June, reflecting investors' desire to buy
so-called 'cyclical stocks', where a recovery in profits is not expected
until 1995.
Mannesmann's added attraction is the gradual contribution to profits from
Mannesmann Mobilfunk, the mobile phones subsidiary.

ERICSSON, the Swedish telecommunications group, expects profits to at least
double in 1993 following a dramatic recovery in first-half net income, to
SKr1.28bn (Dollars 162m) from SKr59m.
The result, which nearly equalled the SKr1.3bn profit for the whole of last
year, was made on the back on strong increases in orders and sales. All
business areas increased income, the company said.
Orders for the period jumped 27 per cent to SKr34bn, while sales rose 35 per
cent to SKr27.4bn. About half of the increase in both figures was due to the
depreciation of the Swedish krona.
The group now has an order backlog of SKr46bn, up 33 per cent from mid-year
1992, after increasing its order intake for the last seven consecutive
quarters.
The most spectacular growth came from the radio communications division,
which includes mobile telephones. For the first time these have overtaken
public telecommunications to become the group's biggest revenue earner.
Sales rose 75 per cent, to SKr10.65bn, in the first half, while public
communications sales increased 15 per cent to SKr10.04bn.
The group's largest market is Italy, which accounted for 12 per cent of
sales, followed by the US, Sweden, the UK and China. China is the group's
fastest growing market, and deliveries of public telecommunications
equipment there have doubled in a year.
The group's gross margins improved in the second quarter, rising to 48 per
cent from 47 per cent in the first quarter, and a further increase is
expected in the second half as the company's income starts to benefit from
the weaker krona. The group's income has so far only been marginally
affected by the currency depreciation because of its hedging policy.
Mr Lars Ramqvist, chief executive, said the company's extensive investments
in new technology provided the basis for continuing growth.

FT  20 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Dawsongroup shares jump 60p
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES IN Dawsongroup , the Milton Keynes-based commercial vehicle hire and
distribution company, surged 60p to 303p yesterday on news of a jump in
interim pre-tax profits from Pounds 1.97m to Pounds 3.55m.
Mr Peter Dawson, the chairman and chief executive who holds almost 75 per
cent of the shares, said the result represented 'an exceptional performance
in what is still a fragile market.'
The 80 per cent rise in profits for the six months to June 30 was achieved
on the back of a 13 per cent increase in turnover to Pounds 24.8m.
Earnings per share rose to 7.7p (4.5p) and the interim dividend is doubled
to 1.5p.
The group has two main divisions - truck and trailer rentals and a large
Volvo truck dealership. Mr Dawson said the rental side, which includes both
short-term and contract hire as well as portable cold stores, continued to
be the cornerstone of the group's recovery.
Activity in the new and used truck market had increased - but from a very
low base. Margins had also been under further pressure on the service and
parts side of the truck dealership.
Turnover from the rentals division was 5 per cent ahead at Pounds 17m, while
pre-tax profits were 86 per cent up at Pounds 3.36m. That was achieved via a
10 per cent increase in rental revenues per unit, better utilisation of a
smaller fleet and quality vehicles which could command higher prices.
In contrast, the commercial vehicle division's turnover was up 34 per cent,
with sales to third parties of Pounds 7.73m (Pounds 5.77m) and intra-group
sales of Pounds 5.91m (Pounds 2.13m), but pre-tax profits were only 12 per
cent ahead at Pounds 191,000.
Mr Clive Gear, finance director, said the company's financial position
remained strong, with gearing almost unchanged at 119 per cent. 'The gearing
may sound high, but in our industry it's exceptionally low.'
Net borrowings were Pounds 38.2m (Pounds 31.7m) and net interest payable was
virtually unchanged at Pounds 2.05m.
The rentals division plans to add at least one location to the current 29,
and to replace more of the fleet. It believes it has a solid base of
contract hire at 46 per cent of revenues, and points out that the portable
cold store sector, now three years old, has doubled both size and turnover
in the first half.

FT  20 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Conrad Ritblat cuts losses to Pounds
184,000
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
WITH ITS preliminary statement for the year ended May 31, showing a much
reduced loss, Conrad Ritblat Sinclair Goldsmith announced the purchase of
the freehold of the building in Glasgow which houses its Scottish
operations.
It is buying the property, in West George Street, from Cityprop for Pounds
2.85m satisfied in 6m ordinary shares, subject to shareholders' approval.
British Linen Bank is arranging the placing of up to 5.68m of the shares at
47.5p each, to raise Pounds 2.7m for the vendor.
The group occupies some 5,150 sq ft of the building at a current rent of
Pounds 61,700 per year; the remainder is let at a total of Pounds 150,000.
The property is generating an income yield of 7.43 per cent.
Mr John Ritblat, chairman of this surveying, estate agency and rating
consultancy group, reminded shareholders that the merger of Conrad Ritblat
and Sinclair Goldsmith was completed just before May 31.
Despite a small drop in turnover from Pounds 2.77m to Pounds 2.67m the
pre-tax loss was cut from Pounds 525,000 to Pounds 184,000 by effective
control of costs. Losses per share were 1.4p (3.5p).
The rating division continued to 'perform with distinction', while the
professional department expanded in valuation work. Agency markets were
difficult because of lack of tenant demand.

FT  20 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Competition hits Nat Power - Market share
expected to fall in face of nuclear and gas-fired plants
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NATIONAL POWER, the largest electricity generator in the UK, expects its
share of the power market to fall by some 7 to 8 per cent to the low 30s
over the next year, Mr John Baker, the company's chief executive, said
yesterday.
The fall, foreshadowed at the company's annual general meeting last month,
is the result in part of increased competition from nuclear and gas-fired
plants.
Most of National Power's units are coal or oil fired.
Mr Baker was speaking to regional journalists. He forecast 'good double
digit dividend growth' for the current year.
Plans were well advanced to reduce the group's dividend cover from the
current 3.1 per cent to 2.5 per cent over the next two years, he said.
His comments come amid widespread speculation about the future of National
Power and PowerGen, the other main electricity generator, arising from an
inquiry by Prof Stephen Littlechild, the industry regulator, into their
costs and margins.
The inquiry has been given added impetus by a rise in prices in the
elec-tricity wholesale market since April.
Prof Littlechild has said he will decide by the end of the year whether to
refer the generators to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
Some analysts believe National Power is unduly pessimistic in its public
announcements.
Mr Baker said it had become increasingly difficult to offset lower earnings
with cost reductions, and earnings growth for the company over the next few
years was uncertain.
On coal he said National Power had not been able substantially to reduce
coal stocks. Prospects for burning more coal in the foreseeable future were
'pretty remote'.
This confirms the worst fears of British Coal which increasingly believes
additional sales this year, essential if reprieved pits are to stay open,
will be small.
Mr Baker said it was in everyone's interest to have an efficient domestic
coal industry.
The company would try to take more local coal over the next few years, but
it had to be at competitive international prices.
Mr Baker confirmed intentions to expand abroad. 'By the end of the decade we
hope that between 10 and 20 per cent of our earnings will come from overseas
investments.'
He indicated that he expected the government would sell its 40 per cent
stakes in National Power and PowerGen by this time next year, provided there
was no reference to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
'The Treasury would clearly like to sell and we would be happy to
co-operate,' Mr Baker stated.

FT  20 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Wickes achieves Pounds 4.1m and resumes
dividend payments
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WICKES, the DIY and timber retailer which came close to collapse two years
ago, yesterday returned to the dividend list after a two-year absence, on
the back of improved interim profits.
The company, which operates 111 stores in the UK, Belgium, the Netherlands
and France, declared an interim pay-out of 0.2p as it revealed pre-tax
profits of Pounds 4.08m for the six months to June 30.
That compared with Pounds 6.5m last year on an FRS 3 basis, which included
extraordinary gains of Pounds 5.1m on the conversion of unsecured loan
stock. Stripping out those gains, the comparable pre-tax profit was Pounds
1.4m.
Earnings were 1.0p (2.1p including extraordinary gains).
Turnover increased to Pounds 294m (Pounds 266.5m). UK turnover increased by
13 per cent and pre-tax profits by 17 per cent.
Excluding new stores, like-for-like sales rose only 0.5 per cent. But Mr
Henry Sweetbaum, chairman, said that represented a 'significant increase in
share' in a static market.
Sales and profits in continental Europe increased by 5 per cent, with
like-for-like sales up 4.5 per cent in spite of the weaker economic climate.
Sales rose 9 per cent at Hunter Timber, whose acquisition for Pounds 273m in
1988 proved to be a severe drain on Wickes' management and financial
resources. Mr Sweetbaum said the chain was now close to making a profit
before interest, after Wickes reduced its size and introduced a system of
incentives for increasing volumes.
Trading remained difficult at the Malden timber and joinery subsidiary,
whose customer base of small 'jobbing' builders was badly hit by the
recession. The new Builders Mate format, however, was performing well, with
11 new branches opening, taking the total to 18.
Wickes plans to open seven more stores in 1993.
Group debt declined from Pounds 73.2m to Pounds 70.6m during the period,
reducing gearing to 88 per cent (94 per cent), and the lower borrowings and
interest rates reduced net interest charges to Pounds 5.23m (Pounds 7.32m).
COMMENT
Wickes created severe difficulties for itself with its diversification into
timber in 1988. Hunter Timber now seems to be turning round, although
falling sales at Malden remain a cause for concern and it may be some time
before store conversions to the new format reverse the decline. Otherwise,
Wickes has played a canny game recently. It stayed out of last year's DIY
price war and emerged with enhanced profits and margins. It has a
distinctive product offer appealing to both DIY enthusiasts and the trade,
and enjoys a strong reputation for customer service and the quality of its
own brand. It is expanding, and well-placed to benefit from improving
consumer spending. Full-year forecasts of up to Pounds 18m put the company
on a high prospective multiple of 28, but Wickes is seen as a recovery stock
and long-term outperformer.

FT  20 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Bass sells 46 pubs to Marston
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BASS has agreed to sell 46 public houses to Marston Thompson &amp; Evershed, the
Staffordshire-based regional brewer, for Pounds 10.8m.
This follows Bass's sale of 44 pubs to Greene King, the East Anglian brewer,
last week for Pounds 17.5m.
Mr John Denning, director of Bass Taverns, said yesterday: 'We continue to
manage our portfolio of pubs to improve the overall quality of our estate
and the return on capital employed.'
Bass has opened 22 new houses so far this year and has a further 16 sites
under development, representing a total investment of Pounds 34m.
The pubs bought by Marston are mainly in south and south-west England and in
Yorkshire and Lincolnshire, areas in which the brewer is not represented in
strength; 38 are freehold and 37 are under management, with the rest let to
tenants.
Mr David Gordon, managing director of Marston, said the outlets acquired
increase the company's estate to 230 managed houses and 664 tenanted
outlets.

<TEXT>
Stakis, the hotels and casinos group, is believed to be close to agreeing
the purchase of Rex Leisure, a privately-owned Coventry-based company which
runs the Rubicon casinos in Coventry, Wolverhampton and Northampton.
The Glasgow-based company, which returned to profit last year after heavy
losses and write-offs in 1991, recently signalled its intention to make
acquisitions.
Last month it raised Pounds 9.6m by a share placing. Of the proceeds Pounds
5.85m is being used to buy a 128-room hotel in York, at present managed by
Holiday Inns (UK). The balance was for other acquisitions.
Stakis refused to comment yesterday.

FT  20 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Bristol Channel shares suspended
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JEAN MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES IN Bristol Channel Ship Repairers were suspended yesterday at 8p at
the company's request pending shareholders' approval of its reorganisation
proposals.
Mr Christopher Bailey, chairman, said the company had started talks with Mr
Andreas O Ugland and other members of his family regarding the proposed
acquisition of a fleet of vessels and a ship management business.
Should the transaction proceed, he said the company expected to fund the
purchase price, expected to be between Pounds 15m and Pounds 20m, by means
of a rights issue. The enlarged group would be better positioned to take
advantage of further shipping-related opportunities, he said.
At the same time the ship repairer and engineer announced a pre-tax loss of
Pounds 591,150 for the year to March 26, compared with profits of Pounds
168,604. Turnover fell to Pounds 48,974 (Pounds 1.27m).
Mr Bailey said the result had been hit by the recession, coupled with the
upgrading work which had effectively closed the dry docks for some months.
The losses were also after a non-recurring charge of Pounds 180,000 for
cancelling management and administration agreements with CH Bailey, a Pounds
124,000 rise in repair and maintenance costs and other non-recurring
charges.
Losses per share were 0.74p, against earnings of 0.21p.
Mr Bailey said that at about the time of the annual meeting he would step
down in favour of Mr Ugland. Other directors would also be resigning.
Mr Ugland is chairman of Ugland Brothers, a ship management company, which
is Bristol's largest shareholder with a 24.19 per cent stake.

FT  20 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Rival Topic systems to be launched in
October
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ICV and Telekurs, the two companies chosen by the London Stock Exchange to
develop the next generation of its Topic market information system, plan to
launch competing versions in October.
ICV, a UK financial information company, took on existing Topic contracts
with users of 14 terminals or fewer, while Telekurs, owned by a consortium
of Swiss banks, took the bigger ones.
There are some 10,000 Topic terminals in use, roughly split between the two
companies.
Telekurs said yesterday that it would unveil a new system on October 4 which
would offer a choice of satellite or landlines for data communication.
ICV said its Topic 3 range, to be launched on October 19, would reduce costs
by between 15 and 30 per cent, compared with the existing version of the
12-year-old service.
The company has invested about Pounds 3m in developing Topic 3 products.
These include a version for use with Windows software.
Mr David Taylor, ICV's managing director, said data for Topic 3 would be
delivered by satellite. ICV has rented broadcast capacity from France
Telecom and has had a special satellite receiving system developed for
customer sites.
Reuters, the UK-based international news and financial information agency,
offers a rival system called UK Equity Focus.

FT  20 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Hillsdown disposes of abattoir to Goodman
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HILLSDOWN Holdings, the food group, has sold another abattoir as part of its
programme of reducing its involvement in the red meat slaughtering industry.
The sale, for an undisclosed sum, is within the provisions the group set up
in 1992 to cover such sales. Hillsdown shares rose 5p to 171p.
The buyer of the abattoir, which is at Torrington in Devon and employs 189
people, is a member of the Goodman International Group, the Irish-owned beef
processing group which in 1990 sought protection from its creditors.
A sharp deterioration in profits from its meat business, in an industry
suffering chronic overcapacity, persuaded Hillsdown to announce in March an
accelerated reduction in its activities in this area.
Hillsdown took a Pounds 92.3m provision in its 1992 accounts covering this
and other problems.
The Torrington abattoir processes 5,000 lambs, 3,000 pigs and 800 cattle a
week, mainly selling to supermarkets and for export. In April, Hillsdown
sold an abattoir, which processed 4,000 lambs and 800 cattle a week, for
Pounds 2.5m.
The Torrington abattoir, part of Hillsdown's North Devon Meat subsidiary, is
EC approved. New EC regulations on abattoirs were introduced in January this
year, but those abattoirs which have not met the new standards can continue
to operate for three years, sustaining the over-capacity problem in the
industry.

M&amp;W, the food retailer and wholesaler, has exchanged contracts to buy eight
neighbourhood convenience stores from Paper Chain (East Anglia). It is
selling on two of the stores to Betta Superette.
The purchase price for the eight stores is Pounds 941,000, plus stock at
valuation payable in cash. The sale of the two stores will raise Pounds
271,000 plus stock at valuation. So the net consideration amounts to Pounds
670,000.
The six stores that M&amp;W is retaining are in Essex, Cambridgeshire,
Hertfordshire and Middlesex. They are not expected to contribute to profits
for the year to October 2 1993. But after that they are expected to put in
Pounds 152,000.

The directors believe that, as a result of a revaluation of the company's

They said it was essential for the company's future that there was an

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VODAFONE, the UK mobile communications group, has set up an international
company to oversee its growing overseas business.
Although the UK still accounts for most of Vodafone's income, the company
has significant stakes in Cellular franchises in Hong Kong, Germany, South
Africa, Australia, Greece, Sweden and Denmark. Half of its projected Pounds
300m capital investment this year is devoted to overseas franchises.
The company has bids pending in Egypt and Hungary, and plans further
expansion in western Europe and the Asia-Pacific region as opportunities
arise. Its medium-term objective is to have overseas franchises covering a
population base as extensive as the UK, allowing for income differentials.
The managing director of Vodafone Group International will be Mr Julian
Horn-Smith, currently managing director of Vodapage.
Mr Gerry Whent, chief executive of Vodafone, said: 'The new company
recognises the important role our overseas businesses will play in the
future of Vodafone, and will allow us to devote the necessary time and
effort to the UK companies which are still the backbone of our business.'

Yorkshire Electricity is to be the first regional electricity company to

It announced yesterday that it was in discussions with the city of Turku,
Finland, about the possible acquisition of its electricity distribution and
district heating businesses.
Mr Tony Coleman, group finance director, said he thought Yorkshire was
'about six weeks from a final decision' by the municipal authorities of
Turku which has about 50,000 customers.
He described the deal under negotiation as 'low-risk and sticking to our
core skills'.
It would be 'pretty arms-length', he added, involving mainly 'experience and
expertise' after the cash contribution.

FT  20 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Cray's former chief offloads entire holding
of 9m shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR PETER Michael, the former chairman of Cray Electronics, yesterday
conditionally sold his entire holding of 8.98m ordinary shares in the data
communications and software systems group, which bought the Dowty
information technology division from TI for Pounds 50m last August.
It is thought the sale price was about 140p, which would have given Sir
Peter about Pounds 12.6m before expenses. Yesterday the shares closed up 2
1/2 p at 148 1/2 p.
Some 3.39m shares were his existing holding. The balance was converted from
his entire holdings of deferred convertible shares, A deferred redeemable
shares, and B deferred redeemable shares.
These derived from the final tranche of Cray's share option-based incentive
bonus package for Sir Peter, Mr Roger Holland, his successor as chairman, Mr
Jeff Harrison, finance director, and Mr Jon Richards, group managing
director.
The bonus was triggered in July by the group's 1992-1993 results.
Pre-tax profits leapt from Pounds 2.35m to Pounds 29m boosted by the Dowty
acquisition.
Earnings were up from 1.9p to 13.8p per share.

<TEXT>
SOTHEBY'S Holdings, the auction house, has cut its quarterly dividend from
15 cents to 6 cents per share, but remains optimistic about future earnings.
The company, which recently reported a 48 per cent expansion in second
quarter net income, had indicated at its annual meeting in June that it
might cut its dividend.
Mr Michael Ainslie, president and chief executive, said the reduction
'reflects the implementation by the board of the previously articulated
position that the company would not maintain a dividend payout in excess of
earnings.'
Last year Sotheby's earnings dropped 69 per cent to 7 cents per share, but
it paid a dividend of 60 cents which was covered by profits from the sale of
inventory and the reduction of its loan portfolio.

FT  20 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Willis Corroon grows 17% to Pounds 63m

<TEXT>
WILLIS CORROON, one of the UK's largest insurance brokers, yesterday
reported pre-tax profits up 17 per cent from Pounds 54.1m to Pounds 63.1m in
the six months ending June 30.
Turnover grew by 12 per cent to Pounds 371.2m (Pounds 331.2m), including
Pounds 367.8m from continuing operations.
Mr Peter Stevens, head of corporate communications, said: 'This is a year
when we were not going to do exciting things with the outside world but to
consolidate.
'We have had a big merger and sorting out, and we have been able to take
good underlying growth in revenues which we ought to be able to maintain.'
Exchange rate movements added Pounds 4.6m to profits. Underlying brokerage
and fee revenue grew by 2 per cent from the previous first half. Underlying
expenses fell by 1 per cent.
On continuing operations, operating expenses rose 12 per cent to Pounds
313.9m and underwriting claims rose to Pounds 13.1m (Pounds 11.5m).
Revenue from continuing broking activities rose 14 per cent to Pounds 365m
and from underwriting activities by 14 per cent to Pounds 28.2m.
The company said premiums remained low in the US, although there were signs
of hardening rates for property risks.
A Pounds 5.8m loss on Sovereign Marine and General, the UK underwriting
business which was closed in 1991, was offset by Pounds 900,000 released
from provisions made to cover run-off from the business over 20 years.
That compared with a loss on Sovereign of Pounds 2.7m in the previous
quarter and a profit of Pounds 100,000 for the six months to June last year.
The dividend was halved to 3.3p in line with the board's decision to
increase its cash position.
The directors approved second and third quarter dividends of 1.65p, with the
alternative of a scrip dividend.
Mr Stevens said the company had a net cash inflow of Pounds 18m, compared
with an outflow of Pounds 32m last year.
'We had quite a cash squeeze in 1992 and it was felt prudent to reduce the
dividend,' he said.
He added that while the lower dividend was easily covered at the time of the
interim results, the bulk of the company's revenues came in the first half
of the year.
Interest and investment income fell by Pounds 600,000 to Pounds 27.1m.
The share of profits from associates rose by 36 per cent to Pounds 5.3m
(Pounds 3.9m).
Earnings per share for total operations increased by 1p to 9.3p and for
continuing operations by 1.9p to 10.2p.

FT  20 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Computer lift for Kode
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A TURNROUND in the computer services business, which benefited from an
acquisition, enabled Kode International to more than double its profits in
the half year ended July 2.
At the pre-tax level profit worked through at Pounds 710,000 (Pounds
330,000), on turnover ahead from Pounds 9.64m to Pounds 12.3m.
DCM Services, the computer services operation, turned in a profit of Pounds
123,000 (losses of Pounds 453,000) in the face of 'unusually difficult'
market conditions, with intense price competition on maintenance contracts.
However, continued success was achieved in non-maintenance.
The printed circuit board companies exceeded budgeted profit, but were down
on 1992 because of the expected reduced business from one of Kam Circuits'
principal customers.
However, Kam was able to win orders from new customers and there had been an
upturn in activity from existing sources.
Earnings in the half year came to 4.3p (2.5p) per share and the interim
dividend is raised from 1.5p to 2p.

FT  20 AUG 93 / Trade Indemnity sees 15% fall in company failures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A CLEAR sign of an end to the UK recession was given yesterday by Trade
Indemnity, the trade credit insurance company. It estimated that the number
of UK company failures would be 15 per cent lower this year than last.
A further 5 per cent fall could be expected next year, according to the
company's estimates - based on reports from its 4,500 clients. In the first
six months of this year business failures were down 19 per cent on the same
period of 1992.
Mr Vic Jacob, managing director, said: 'It's nice to have some bright
comments. All of the major trends are in the right direction. I think it is
almost three and a half years since we have been able to take a more
positive view.'
Trade Indemnity had not had to make any adjustments to underwriting
provisions because of the fewer claims and failures. The first-half results,
released yesterday, showed gross claims from continuing operations down by a
fifth to Pounds 51.4m.
But Mr Jacob warned that turnover was still static or even declining at many
companies. This was highlighted in Trade Indemnity's premium growth - which
tends to rise with company turnover - of just 2.3 per cent to Pounds 71.3m.
'So far our policyholders are not reporting increased expectations of
turnover.'
Mr Jacob also said that a Pounds 1m provision released because of the
improving economic position in the UK had been offset by increased
provisions to cover worsening conditions in the rest of Europe.
Net premiums written were unchanged at Pounds 26.4m and net claims fell to
Pounds 24m, from Pounds 27.6m. There were exceptional costs of Pounds
917,000 from the voluntary redundancy of about 40 staff.
The company also showed a tax credit of Pounds 2.1m, from its total unused
tax losses from past underwriting of more than Pounds 30m.
Historically the rate of company failures continues to rise for 18 months
after the beginning of economic recovery, partly as a result of
over-trading. But Mr Jacob said it was too early in the recovery to see
these effects.
Premium income from the export cover division - which sells primarily to
businesses in the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development -
had risen by 20 per cent. This partly reflected the recovery of sterling and
strength of British exporters.

FT  20 AUG 93 / ABB to eliminate 7,000 jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   VIENNA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ASEA Brown Boveri, the world's largest power engineering group, has reported
flat pre-tax profits of Dollars 497m (Pounds 333.5m) for the first half and
sees little improvement for the rest of the year.
'Short-term growth prospects in western Europe have not improved. In North
America, the beginning of an economic recovery has so far had only a
marginal impact on ABB's range of products,' the Swiss-Swedish group said.
In view of depressed demand in Europe and North America, the group said it
would accelerate its rationalisation programme, eliminating a further 7,000
jobs by the end of the year. New provisions of Dollars 500m would be made
against 1993 earnings.
Since spring 1990, ABB has eliminated 40,000 jobs. However, total employment
has risen from 213,000 at the end of last year to 218,000 through
acquisitions.
ABB said that a number of production and engineering plants in Europe and
North America had been identified for closure or cuts but gave no details. A
spokesman said the reductions would be made across its divisions, with the
exception of the power distribution division.
New orders were down 12 per cent to Dollars 15bn in the first half and the
intake rate worsened in the second quarter.
The level of new orders for power plants and transportation equipment held
up close to previous year levels, but those for other divisions dropped
significantly, notably in the industrial plant sector, where they plunged 25
per cent to Dollars 2.24bn.
Group revenues were off 5 per cent in the first half to Dollars 13.1bn.
Excluding currency effects, however, they rose 2 per cent. Operating income
advanced 4 per cent to Dollars 937m, thanks to higher earnings in the power
plant and financial services segments. Profits before non-recurring items
and taxes eased 2 per cent to Dollars 518m, but excluding currency effects,
were up 10 per cent.
ABB said order intake had begun to pick up in the second half. It confirmed
a previous forecast made by Mr Percy Barnevik, its chief executive, that
pre-tax profits for the full year, before non-recurring items, would reach
about the same level as last year's Dollars 1.11bn.

FT  20 AUG 93 / Metcalfe to lead Queens Moat Houses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR STANLEY Metcalfe, former chairman and chief executive of Ranks Hovis
McDougall, is to become non-executive chairman of Queens Moat Houses after
the hotel group's annual meeting next Thursday.
Mr John Bairstow, QMH's founder, resigned as chairman yesterday. QMH is
continuing talks with its 65 banks over refinancing debts of Pounds 1bn.
Losses for 1992 have yet to be reported.
Mr Bairstow will not receive any compensation for leaving, in common with
nine other directors of the group who have resigned since its shares were
suspended in March.
He stepped down to the post of non-executive chairman last month and said
then that he would resign once a new chairman was found.
Mr Bairstow will not have to attend the annual meeting. It will be chaired
by Mr Andrew Coppell, who was made chief executive last month after being
brought in as a consultant.
Mr Coppell said that Mr Metcalfe was a man 'with solid industrial experience
and familiar with the disciplines required at QMH. He will make a
significant contribution to the recovery of the group'. Mr Metcalfe had the
support of the group's main bankers, but would be a 'champion for the
shareholders'.
Mr Metcalfe, who will work three days a week, was available following RHM's
takeover by Tomkins, the industrial conglomerate, at the end of 1992. He had
worked for RHM for the whole of his business career, but his lack of
experience in hotels was thought yesterday not to be a problem.
A QMH adviser said of Mr Metcalfe, 'he is very aggressive, opinionated and
pushy which is good for a company in this situation'. He was also described
as 'a strong leader'.
One food sector analyst said: 'Mr Metcalfe is a man of integrity, diligence
and discipline and that's what QMH needs. They have got hotel management.'
However, he was critical of some aspects of his management at RHM. In 1988
RHM resisted a Pounds 1.7bn bid from Goodman Fielder Wattie, the Australian
food group, but last year agreed to the Pounds 935m bid from Tomkins.
Another analyst said: 'I am a fan of Metcalfe, but I think I'm the only one.
People forget that when he became managing director in 1981 the share price
was 48p and he took it to 480p.' The Tomkins cash bid was worth 260p a
share.
'He took a run-down, over-geared, not very profitable business and turned it
into a very profitable company and transformed the balance sheet,' he added.

FT  20 AUG 93 / Glaxo awaits Zantac patent ruling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A DECISION in the lawsuit over the world's biggest selling drug, Zantac, may
not be made until the end of the year, the drug's maker, Glaxo, said
yesterday.
US District Court Judge Terrence Boyle, presiding in Elizabeth City, North
Carolina, has retired to consider the evidence from 16 expert witnesses
brought by Glaxo and Novopharm, a Canadian maker of generic (unbranded)
drugs.
Sales of Zantac, an ulcer treatment, are worth about Dollars 3.5bn (Pounds
2.3bn) a year. If Novopharm won the case, it would be able to sell a generic
version of Zantac from 1995. Mr Ian Smith, a drug sector analyst at broker
Lehman Brothers in London, estimates that Glaxo would then lose Dollars 700m
of revenue in the first year alone.
The case was brought by Glaxo after Novopharm sought government permission
to make generic Zantac. Novopharm is challenging one of Glaxo's two main
patents on ranitidine hydrochloride, the active ingredient in Zantac. It is
arguing that a specific crystalline form of the drug, known as Form 2, is
not sufficiently innovative to warrant a patent.
Novopharm says that the two versions are chemically the same, but Glaxo says
Form 1 has never been sold and Zantac is based on Form 2. A less specific
patent for ranitidine hydrochloride runs out in 1995, but Form 2 is
protected until 2002.
Over the past eight days Judge Boyle has heard eight witnesses from each
company presenting legal and chemical arguments on the originality of Form
2.
The outcome of this case is likely to affect another being brought against
Glaxo by a Canadian generics maker called Genpharm. That case is due to be
heard in May 1994.
These companies are struggling over the future of a money-spinning drug at
the peak of its earning power. Sales over the next few years are likely to
fall.
Zantac's arch-rival Tagamet, made by UK company SmithKline Beecham, comes
off patent next year. Generic drug manufacturers are poised to launch a
cut-price version. Zantac is also being challenged by a newer drug from
Swedish company Astra.
At the same time government pressure on the pricing of drugs generally
remains high, especially in the world's biggest market, the US.

FT  20 AUG 93 / A burst of light for banks in Nordic gloom: The rise of a
sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES and KAREN FOSSLI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Judging by the extraordinary rise in Nordic banking shares this year, the
market has decided the sector's financial crisis is over.
Euphoria based on the belief that Nordic banks are firmly on the road to
recovery has lifted shares from the lows to which they sank last year. Bank
shares have risen 270 per cent in Sweden, 185 per cent in Finland and 165
per cent in Norway.
Much of the buying has had a speculative flavour, yet recent developments
have borne out the speculators' most fervent hopes.
Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken, the region's largest commercial bank,
withdrew its request for state support this week after a return to profit in
the second quarter and a SKr5.3bn (Pounds 440m) rights issue.
Yesterday Unitas, the Finnish banking group, said it too was launching a
rights issue on the back of improved performance.
Norway's two biggest banks, Den norske Bank (DnB) and Christiania Bank,
reported a return to profit in the first half, with DnB saying it will not
need a NKr600m (Pounds 55m) state guarantee.
The optimism has sprung from a dramatic improvement in earnings, rather than
from a drying up of the credit losses - or debt write-offs - which have
ravaged the sector. SE Banken's figures demonstrate this: its operating
income before loan losses was up 58 per cent in the first half at SKr4.85bn.
The most important factor has been interest rates which now lie at their
lowest levels for at least 10 years in all three countries.
This has enabled the banks to widen their margins, boosting net interest
income. It has also prompted rallies in bond and share markets, enhancing
the trading contribution.
Banks have helped themselves by restructuring. DnB, for example, claims to
have cut costs by 40 per cent over five years, leading its president Mr Finn
Hvistendahl to claim this week that he knew of 'no other large bank which
can point to similar cost effectiveness'.
One worry is that some of the gains reported in the first half will prove to
be of a one-off nature. This applies particularly to share, bond and foreign
exchange income.
But a bigger cause of concern is the high level of credit losses. Even
though lower interest rates should reduce the bruden on customers, most
banks are being extremely cautious about predicting anything more than a
modest drop in loan losses in 1993.
SE Banken, for instance, has warned that credit losses this year could reach
SKr11bn, only slightly less than last year's SKr11.2bn. Its non-performing
loan portfolio, though declining, still amounts to SKr22.5bn, or 7.4 per
cent of total lending.
Even the two big Norwegian banks, the first in the region to enter crisis,
reported largely unchanged credit loss levels at the half-way stage. DnB
actually saw a slight increase in non-performing loans.
In Finland, where the structural economic problems are greater than in
either Sweden or Norway, Kansallis-Osake-Pankki, the country's leading
commercial bank, and Unitas expect to cut their losses this year. At KOP,
credit losses increased to FM933m (Pounds 107m) in the first four months,
against FM728m, and non-performing loans grew to FM8.2bn from FM7.1bn at the
end of 1992.
'The worst is past in the Finnish banking sector but the crisis is not yet
over,' says Mr Roar Nilson, chief financial analyst with Arctos Securities
in Helsinki. 'Credit losses in the public sector, among personal customers
and in domestically orientated companies can be expected to increase.'
Most analysts believe the picture will start to change next year. In any
banking recovery, there is always a time lag before non-performing loans
begin to fall sharply and their conversion into bad debts tapers off. Hence
some of the region's banks may not be back in profit until 1996.
And nervousness persists about the pace of economic recovery, although less
so in oil-rich Norway than in either Sweden or Finland. But even those two
are beginning to see the first signs of an export-led recovery and both
should see at least a slight expansion of their economies next year, ending
three consecutive years of decline.
Governments are growing confident that the final bill for bailing out their
financial systems will be less than they originally feared. Indeed, in
Norway, the belief that the country's six-year banking crisis is nearly over
has encouraged the state-backed Bank Insurance Fund to consider accelerating
privatisation plans for DnB and Christiania Bank.
Sweden also has plans to return Gota Bank and Nordbanken to the private
sector.
The key, though, to the privatisation of banks in the Nordic area will be
evidence of sustained profitability. That, for all the euphoria of recent
days, has still to be demonstrated.

FT  20 AUG 93 / Paris unveils five-year jobs plan: Taxes on employers to be
cut - More flexible labour market sought
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRANCE yesterday launched a five-year plan to create jobs by reducing taxes
on employers and increasing the flexibility of the labour market, but
leaving the social security system intact.
Rising unemployment, which stands at 11.6 per cent of the workforce and is
forecast to reach 12.5 per cent by the end of the year, is one of the
biggest problems facing Mr Edouard Balladur's centre-right RPR-UDF coalition
government. Reducing unemployment is seen as central to the hopes of the
conservative parties in the 1995 presidential election.
Mr Michel Giraud, the labour minister who unveiled the 55-point plan, said
it was aimed at addressing the structural problems of the labour market. He
said it would cut the costs of hiring workers, encourage part-time
employment and ease rigidities in working practices.
The principal measures include the transfer from employers to the government
of social security charges for France's lowest paid workers. The transfer is
expected to include employees earning up to 1.5 times the minimum wage of
about FFr5,900 (Pounds 660) a month.
The plan also proposes the replacement of the 39-hour working week with an
equivalent annual total to improve the flexibility of production within
industry and cut overtime payments.
Under the proposals, part-time workers will be able to increase the number
of hours they work while receiving state benefits. The system of
apprenticeships and training will be devolved to local government
organisation.
But the measures stopped short of reforming the minimum wage, or salaire
minimum de croissance (Smic), regarded by industrialists as one of the most
important obstacles to employment. Mr Balladur said last week he would not
use 'the pretext of economic crisis to reduce the protection of the least
advantaged'.
The measures were also limited by budgetary considerations. Labour market
analysts estimated that transferring social security payments to the state
would cost about FFr4.8bn this year and more than FFr100bn for the five-year
period.
The government has forecast a budget deficit for the current year of
FFr317bn. But private sector economists, such as Mr Jean-Francois Mercier at
Salomon Brothers, predict the deficit will be closer to FFr350bn.
Economists in Paris said the plan was unlikely to have a rapid impact on
unemployment. 'They are right to address structural issues,' said one
economist, 'but the Smic is untouched and the economic situation is likely
to push unemployment higher.'
The stagnant state of the French economy was illustrated yesterday by
industrial production figures which showed output in June had declined by
0.2 per cent from May and that second quarter production was 0.3 per cent
below the first quarter.
Union leaders, who will discuss the plan with Mr Balladur next month,
expressed their opposition. Mr Marc Blondel, general secretary of Force
Ouvriere, described it as 'dangerous'. But the government's large
parliamentary majority suggests that significant changes are unlikely.

FT  20 AUG 93 / Eight Israeli soldiers killed in south Lebanon bomb attacks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   JERUSALEM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRO-IRANIAN guerrillas inflicted the worst casualties in five years on
Israeli troops in southern Lebanon yesterday, prompting retaliation and
plunging the Middle East into violence for the second time in a month.
At least eight Israeli soldiers were killed and four wounded in two separate
attacks by the Islamic fundamentalist Hizbollah (Party of God) militia.
In response to the first attack, eight Israeli warplanes bombed guerrilla
positions in Lebanon's Bekaa valley, killing two Hizbollah fighters.
The US said it deplored the attack on the Israelis and described it as a
'calculated attempt by extremists to derail the Arab-Israeli peace process'.
Hundreds of Lebanese civilians, fearing another Israeli offensive, fled
their homes in the south, and the Lebanese army was placed on maximum alert.
Observers in Jerusalem said the Israeli air strike on targets 3km west of
the Syrian border was also meant as a warning to Damascus, which has
thousands of troops in the Bekaa valley, and which Israel blames for
allowing the Hizbollah attack. Gen Ehud Barak, chief of staff, said last
night that Israel retained its right to retaliate further.
In the first Hizbollah attack, Israel said seven soldiers from the Golani
infantry brigade had been killed and two wounded in a dawn roadside bombing
in the western sector of Israel's self-declared 'security zone'. The second
incident, which left one soldier dead and two wounded, occurred when an
Israeli patrol returned to the same area in the evening after the Israeli
air raid.
The Hizbollah raid was the deadliest since a suicide car bomb attack killed
eight people and wounded seven in October 1988. The attacks brought Israeli
casualties in the zone this year to 17 dead and 31 wounded.
It came less than three weeks after a US-brokered ceasefire ended a
seven-day Israeli air and artillery bombardment of villages in southern
Lebanon. The Israeli offensive, aimed at curbing Hizbollah rocket attacks
against northern Israeli towns, left 130 dead, more than 600 wounded and
1,500 homes destroyed.
The informal ceasefire agreement between Israel and Syria, which acts as a
conduit for Iranian-supplied weapons to Hizbollah, did not cover attacks
against the so-called security zone.
Sheikh Naim Qassem, deputy general secretary of Hizbollah, said yesterday's
operation was 'a new lesson for Israel'.

FT  20 AUG 93 / UK car output hit by export sales fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FALL in car sales in continental Europe has thrown UK production into
reverse after 18 months of almost uninterrupted growth to the highest levels
for nearly 20 years.
Short-time working has already occurred in parts of the UK car industry and
there was mounting concern yesterday over a further sharp deterioration in
production in the already depressed commercial vehicles sector.
Statistics showing a 49.68 per cent fall in commercial vehicle output last
month were described as 'extremely serious' by the Society of Motor
Manufacturers and Traders. The figures are considered by the industry to
reflect the patchiness of economic recovery in the UK and falling export
demand because of the recession elsewhere in Europe.
Total car output in July was down only marginally, by 2.42 per cent to
115,648 compared with 118,514 in the same month last year. For the first
seven months it remained 6.63 per cent ahead of the 1992 period at 858,617,
compared with 805,261.
But, in the first significant fall this year, production for export dropped
by 16 per cent in July, to 33,578 from 39,977 in the same month a year ago.
The industry fears that it can no longer escape the effects of a drop of
about one-fifth in continental car sales since the start of this year.
'As far as car production is concerned, we are now seeing the influence we
forecast of the sharp fall in sales in virtually every market throughout
continental Europe,' said Mr Roger King, the SMMT's public affairs director.
'Production for the home market was slightly ahead of last year, but overall
production levels are clearly at risk in the face of shrinking exports,' he
added.
Continuing growth in UK new car sales, the only main European car market
undergoing a recovery, is expected to prevent any deep downturn in UK car
output. New domestic car sales in the first seven months were 9.1 per cent
higher than a year ago, and most estimates are that sales will reach
1.75m-1.8m this year, compared with 1.59m in 1992.
Production for the rest of this year would have to fall by more than
one-third of 1992 levels not to reach last year's total of 1.29m. Most
industry forecasters still expect the final outcome to be about 1.4m, which
would be the highest since 1975.
Ford last night denied reports that it was planning to introduce a four-day
week at Dagenham, where it makes Fiestas, or at its Escort plant at Halewood
on Merseyside. However, it said it was keeping the situation 'under constant
review'. On previous occasions this year it has cut 24 shifts at Halewood
and five on the Dagenham assembly line.
Peugeot Talbot has suspended production of its UK market mainstay, the 405,
at its Ryton plant near Coventry and is reducing output from 1,900 to 1,600
cars a week of only one model, the 306. Some 300 jobs are being cut.

FT  20 AUG 93 / The Lex Column: ABB
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Any company which swallows a Dollars 500m (Pounds 335.50m) restructuring
charge and continues to shed jobs at the rate of 1,000 a month may be
presumed to be in a spot of trouble. But in Asea Brown Boveri's instance,
quite the reverse may be the case. Although heavy capital goods markets have
remained sickly throughout the western world, ABB continues to make
progress. Flat pre-tax profits of Dollars 497m at the half-year represents a
fine achievement when currency swings are taken into account. The
restructuring charge will pull costs forward and depress profits for the
year. But it will have little effect on ABB's ability to fund the dividend.
Shareholders are therefore right not to blink.
Longer term, the restructuring programme will enable ABB to shift production
from high to low cost sites. This will enhance cost competitiveness and help
ABB win new business in the promising markets of eastern Europe and the Far
East. ABB is also making striking efforts to reduce manufacturing lead times
and improve capital and labour productivity. More leaden-footed rivals, such
as Siemens, can only stand and gawp.
That said, neither the Swedish or Swiss markets have been neglectful of the
respective charms of Asea or Brown Boveri. Both shares have seemingly
powered ahead of the anticipated upturn in the capital goods cycle. Yet
those prepared to wait should reap full benefit when sales volumes and
margins swing higher.

FT  20 AUG 93 / The Lex Column: Willis Corroon
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
On an optimistic view of the insurance cycle, Willis Corroon is now more
geared to the upturn than its rival Sedgwick. Following the acquisition of
Noble Lowndes this week, around 25 per cent of the latter's revenue comes
from benefits consulting - a business more likely to show steady growth than
spectacular cyclical recovery. While Willis also has ambitions in
consulting, its operations are proportionately smaller. On that basis Willis
might now deserve the higher rating.
Despite yesterday's encouraging figures, though, it is too early to argue
that all insurance markets have turned. The large rise in first-half profits
was due to early insurance renewals. That hints at an equal measure of
disappointment to come in the second half. Adjusting for this and the
benefit of exchange rates, growth in insurance broking revenue was modest.
The creditable underlying decline in expenses also owes something to
history. Having acquired the US broker Corroon &amp; Black in 1990, Willis still
has room to cut costs. When that process comes to an end upward pressure on
expenses will be more difficult to resist. Underwriting losses are a
reminder that brokers have been no more successful at the business of
insurance than insurers themselves.
These factors will barely dent the earnings recovery if US insurance
premiums stage the kind of recovery seen in the mid-1980s. But with no sign
of US rates hardening other than in specialist areas, that looks a distant
hope. A price earnings ratio more than 20 times this years forecast earnings
demands something more substantial.

Useful though its jobs package will be, the French government is not
stimulating the economy as fast as investors would like. True, the reduction
in payroll taxes, at a cost to the government of some FFr105bn (Pounds
11.95bn) over five years, will provide some impetus. But the more important,
if politically explosive, issue of the high minimum wage has been skirted.
Since the minimum wage has recently risen faster than average manufacturing
wages, French workers have been priced out of jobs. Yet the rise in French
unemployment to 11.6 per cent, may stem less from labour market rigidities
than a sheer lack of demand. Here, the government is constrained from doing
much because of budgetary pressures. But its continuing reluctance to cut
interest rates hardly helps.
Still, investors appear remarkably sanguine, despite the government's
refusal to move faster on interest rate cuts. Both equity and bond markets
appear convinced that the economy will recover even if they remain uncertain
about the timing. Moreover, the rise in the Paris bourse has lagged the fall
in bond yields over the year. There may well be more headroom for equities
once short-term rates fall. The huge quantities of cash held in French money
market funds will then have nowhere else to go.

FT  20 AUG 93 / The Lex Column: Better off at Barclays
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Leaping out of knickers and into bank manager's trousers in one fluent
movement is a difficult and potentially hazardous stunt. So if Mr Martin
Taylor can manage it on his way from Courtaulds Textiles to Barclays, his
track record will seem all the more impressive. Certainly, Barclays' new
chief executive faces a formidable challenge. His most immediate concern
must be that the pair of trousers he is heading for appear to be occupied
already. It is commonly assumed that Mr Andrew Buxton's executive role will
steadily wither, transforming him into a more conventional non-executive
chairman. Mr Buxton, however, may have other ideas.
To the extent that the two men strike up a harmonious working relationship,
that may not matter too much. In truth, few chairman in such large companies
act in a purely non-executive capacity. Yet the test of such relationships
and structures comes when they are put under strain. Mr Buxton will have to
show uncommon flexibility of mind when Mr Taylor wants to sacrifice some of
the sacred cows which the chairman has lived with for decades, especially as
the process will not start until next year, by which time earnings will have
improved further, the rights-issues-to-dividend-cut fiasco will be a fading
memory and complacency will be creeping back. The position of other board
members will then be crucial, and some of them have recently shown
disturbing signs of pursuing their own agendas.
Perhaps the most difficult challenge facing Mr Taylor is transforming the
culture of Barclays' retail branch network at a time when banks have broken
their implicit lifetime employment pact with employees, and, judging by
Barclays' margins, customers are being soaked for past management mistakes.
If he can crack that issue Mr Taylor really will deserve his phenomenal
reputation.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
ISRAELI warplanes blasted targets in eastern Lebanon yesterday in
retaliation for a bomb attack by pro-Iranian guerrillas which killed at
least seven Israeli soldiers and wounded two others. It was the deadliest
guerrilla attack in five years.
Last night, a second bomb attack on Israeli forces in the security zone in
southern Lebanon killed another soldier and wounded two.
The US said it deplored the attack on the Israelis and described it as a
'calculated attempt by extremists to derail the (Arab-Israeli) peace
process'.
Hundreds of Lebanese civilians, fearing another Israeli shelling offensive,
fled their homes in the south, and the Lebanese army was placed on maximum
alert.
Eight Israeli aircraft struck at positions of the Islamic fundamentalist
Hizbollah (Party of God) militia in Lebanon's Bekaa valley killing two
Hizbollah fighters. The Israeli raid came hours after Hizbollah claimed
responsibility for the dawn attack on Israeli soldiers in the zone Israel
occupies in southern Lebanon.
Observers in Jerusalem said the Israeli strike on targets 3km west of the
Syrian border was also meant as a warning to Damascus, which has thousands
of troops stationed in the Bekaa valley, and which Israel blames for
allowing the Hizbollah attack.
Israeli and Lebanese security officials issued conflicting accounts on the
attack. Israel said seven soldiers had been killed and two wounded from the
Golani brigade in a single bomb blast.
The Lebanese version claimed that Hizbollah had exploded three bombs and
fired machine guns against an Israeli foot patrol near the village of
Shinin, killing eight soldiers and wounding four.
The Hizbollah raid was the most deadly since a 1988 suicide car bomb attack
and it brought Israeli casualties in the zone this year to at least 16 dead
and 29 wounded. Yesterday's resurgence of violence came less than three
weeks after a US-arranged ceasefire ended a devastating seven-day Israeli
air and artillery bombardment of villages in southern Lebanon.
For years, Syria has allowed Hizbollah to mount attacks on Israeli forces
inside Lebanon. Israel had hoped that the ceasefire agreement laid the
ground for improved relations with Damascus and progress in peace talks.

<TEXT>
The recent correspondence on smoking has reminded a colleague of a North Sea
ferry crossing he made a few years ago. The cabin, which was shared by six
strangers, displayed a sign explaining that smoking was allowed 'by
consensus'.
In the middle of the night five sleepers were awoken by the sixth occupant,
a burly soldier going home on leave, who asked if it was all right for him
to smoke. Yes, it was agreed after some eye-rubbing, he could smoke. 'Oh
good,' he said, 'anyone got a cig?'

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
So ex-RHM boss Stanley Metcalfe, who made his name in millin' and bakin', is
adding hotel-keepin' to his portfolio. A blunt Yorkshireman, the new
non-executive chairman of Queens Moat Houses is not keen on talking to the
press but he clearly has his fans at Morgan Grenfell, the merchant bank
which has taken a lead role in advising QMH.
Andrew Coppel, QMH's new chief executive, is a one-time Morgan man, and RHM
was a Morgan client before the food group was taken over by Tomkins at the
end of last year. Given that QMH owes Pounds 1bn to 65 banks, it might have
been thought that the job of chairman would go to a banker. However, when
Morgan drew up its shortlist, Metcalfe's name was on top. Old colleagues at
RHM are wondering whether one of his first moves will be to take RHM's
redundant headquarters in Windsor off Tomkins' hands. It would make a
smashing hotel.

'Take the train to Windsor for an unforgettable day out' gushes NetWork
SouthEast's latest lavishly-illustrated poster. Among the attractions on the
poster, promoting cheap fares, is a cut-away drawing of Windsor Castle which
clearly depicts St George's Hall 'primarily used for banquets' and the
Waterloo Chamber which 'the Royal Family use for their Christmas pantomime'.
Bit odd, since both these imposing state rooms were all but destroyed in
last year's fire. British Rail would be providing the country with a better
service if it encouraged trippers to visit Buckingham Palace which has been
specially opened to raise money to repair Windsor Castle.

The arrival of Martin Taylor at the top of Barclays Bank is good news for
Burnley. Apart from Charles Townley, the antique marble collector, James
Stevenson, the Hollywood actor, and General Scarlet of the Crimea war, the
Lancashire mill town has up to now been noted mainly for breeding
footballing talent, most of which was exported to keep Burnley Football Club
alive.
Despite Taylor's old Etonian education (he won a scholarship) and accent, he
is a Burnley lad at heart. His brother is a well-known local solicitor and
the local newspaper has dubbed him the 'Burnley-born genius'.
'He is so energetic it is tiring even to talk to him. He talks like he
lives. Fast]' says the Burnley Express, which also revealed the little known
fact that Taylor has been known to talk to himself. Who knows - the local
chamber of commerce might even name a park bench after him.

FT  20 AUG 93 / Observer: Not enough rights left
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Traditionally, August is a rum month for reshuffle speculation at
Westminster with MPs off on their hols.
But this time it's rife and the rumour-mongers are showing a particularly
keen interest in the medical bulletins of education secretary John Patten
and the DTI boss Michael Heseltine.
Should either of these cabinet big-wigs be declared unfit to continue, the
argument runs, the prime minister would have an opening to finish off what
he started in May when he sacked chancellor Norman Lamont.
The keenest speculators are the Tory party's disaffected right. They are
dismayed by the monopoly of 'wets' in the main economic departments (Kenneth
Clarke, David Hunt and Heseltine himself). But the right's problem remains
the dearth of credible alternatives. Baroness Blatch would be an obvious
successor to Patten. She is not one of them, and nor is Stephen Dorrell, the
financial secretary and Peter Walker protege. The right's only real star is
the cerebral John Redwood but he has only just been given Wales.
The assumption is that Hezza will not return to duty until the Tory party
conference in October but John Patten is expected back at his desk on
Monday. His first public performance will give the speculators a chance to
judge whether he really is fit for action.

FT  20 AUG 93 / Leading Article: Germany's challenge
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE THIRD year of unification has, says the latest OECD report on Germany,
brought 'mixed results'. So, indeed, it has. It has brought a deep
recession, for one thing and declining inflation, for another. Fortunately,
German economic policy should soon weigh less heavily on its neighbours,
even if its own struggle with unification will remain long and arduous.
The immediate economic effect of unification on the east German economy was
collapse: in 1991 east German real gross domestic product fell by 31 per
cent. For west Germany and its neighbours, however, it was expansionary.
With German demand rising still faster than did output, its current account
swung from a huge surplus of 5 per cent of GDP in 1989 to a deficit of 1 1/2
per cent in 1992, to the delight of its European neighbours.
The delight was not to last. The inflationary effects of unification were a
red rag to the Bundesbank, already provoked by Mr Kohl's casual treatment at
the time of the monetary unification. Monetary policy was bound to tighten,
particularly in response to the wage push of 1991 and 1992. But the
Bundesbank is finding it particularly difficult to lower inflation this
time, largely because inflationary pressure has emanated from the public
sector, private services and housing and construction, while inflation in
the internationally exposed sectors is already less than 2 per cent.
However difficult lowering inflation may prove, nothing will stop the
Bundesbank from trying. Given the tight monetary policy, the dwindling away
of the fiscal stimulus and the length of the preceding expansion, it is
hardly surprising that the German economy shrank at an annual rate of 1.5
per cent in the second half of 1992. In addition, says the OECD, it will
shrink by 3.2 per cent in the first half of 1993, with a weak recovery
expected only next year.
When the Germany economy catches a cold, its ERM-tied neighbours are certain
to sneeze. What has aggravated the disturbance has been the instability in
German policies and economic performance. This at least should soon end.
From the smoke of the past few years should emerge a Germany with massive,
but manageable, structural problems.
The economy of eastern Germany is in ruins. The share of manufacturing in
eastern Germany's value-added, for example, is down to 14 per cent, while
the transfer-supported level of demand is almost double the total
value-added. Eastern Germany needs a growth miracle. With hourly wages in
1992 65 per cent of the west German level, but output per worker at only 40
per cent, it is unlikely to enjoy one. This will leave western Germany with
a huge transfer burden. Transfers are about 5 per cent of west German GDP
this year and are likely to remain that high for years.
Nevertheless, the OECD believes the fiscal position is containable. The
ratio of gross public debt to GDP should not much exceed 60 per cent by
2000, even with trend growth of only 2 per cent a year. Meanwhile, the
Bundesbank is likely to ensure modest inflation, but reduce short term
interest rates substantially quite soon. With an external deficit, as west
German savings continue to flow eastward, this should mean a weak exchange
rate (both nominal and real).
The first consequence of German unification was economic expansion. The
second was contraction. The third, likely to last rather longer than the
first two, should be recovery. Meanwhile, Germany's neighbours should enjoy
greater competitiveness against the rest of the world, combined with
reasonably stable exchange rates against the D-Mark and considerably lower
short-term interest rates. Germany is only at the beginning of its long
voyage towards economic and social integration. But with luck, both it and
the rest of Europe will soon see the haven of recovery.

FT  20 AUG 93 / Iron fist in a velvet glove: Is an ex-journalist and
Mandarin scholar the right man to run a UK clearing bank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON and JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For a man of 41, Mr Martin Taylor has acquired a remarkable reputation in
the British business community. The image is an unusual one: old Etonian,
Oxford Chinese scholar, editor of the FT's Lex Column, chairman of
Courtaulds Textiles. Hugely bright and hugely endowed with boyish charm. For
all his success, a man without enemies.
He may be about to acquire some. As the new chief executive of Barclays
Bank, he will enter a politically charged and perhaps hostile environment.
Clearing bankers tend to be clannish and conservative. What will they make
of an ex-journalist and manufacturer being parachuted in above them?
He has another problem. His appointment is the result of highly public
pressure from shareholders on Barclays and its chairman, Mr Andrew Buxton,
to split the roles of chairman and chief executive. In his new role, Mr
Taylor will have a chairman and deputy chairman above him and three
divisional managing directors below him. What exactly will his function be?
How does he know he is not being put in as a sop to shareholders?
'You just decide to trust people,' he said yesterday. 'I'm absolutely sure
they want someone to do the job. I think they know I'm not the sort of
person who'd hang around otherwise.'
The last bit is characteristically adroit: the hint of steel, charmingly
expressed. It is almost an effort to recall that as head of Courtaulds
Textiles, he achieved his remarkable success at least partly by ruthlessly
closing factories. 'That's not a process that I relish,' he says. 'It's one
of the most disagreeable things I've had to do.'
He is a paradox in other respects. Financial journalists tend to be feckless
folk: the better they are, the less likely they are to be able to run a
whelk stall. Mr Taylor was a brilliant journalist. He has gone on to be a
brilliant hands-on manager.
It is no less paradoxical that in the bitchy world of journalism, he is
recalled as being both very clever and very popular. He is very fast in
thought and speech: at one stage as a young man he underwent speech therapy,
since his attempts to express the rapidity of his thought made him at times
unintelligible.
But however quick he is, the size of his latest step must leave room for
apprehension. Well, yes, he says. There are areas of terror. 'The main one
is that there's a huge organisation here and I don't know what goes on
inside it. But I've been used to managing a business with lots of people in
it. When I took over at Courtaulds Textiles in 1987 it had 35,000 employees.
That's not nearly as big as Barclays, but it's of a size where plainly you
can't know everyone.'
Of course, he concedes, there is a risk that the culture will reject him.
'If I behave stupidly, yes. There are dead certain ways of getting up
people's noses, like not listening and pretending you know more than they
do.'
But his ignorance of banking, he argues, is not complete. 'I've been
interested in banking and credit all my life. I've always been seen in the
textiles industry as a City man. The irony is that now I'm here at Barclays,
everyone says 'what the hell are you doing here? You're a manufacturer'.
Perhaps I'm just a split personality.'
He also claims another qualification, if a slightly indirect one. High
street banking is a form of retailing. Nearly a third of Courtaulds
Textiles' sales go to Marks and Spencer, the formidably successful retail
chain. 'I've been working very closely with Marks and Spencer for 10 years,'
Mr Taylor says. 'What I've learned about from Marks is the way it thinks of
its customers, and the way it sees the world through their eyes. I sense the
banks are starting to do the same.'
Mr Taylor might also with justice argue that the jump from Courtaulds
Textiles to Barclays is no bigger than the jump from the Lex Column to
Courtaulds. But there is one striking difference. When he went to
Courtaulds, Mr Taylor went as the protege of Sir Christopher Hogg. (Sir
Christopher, now chairman of Reuters and the Courtaulds chemical empire, is
to replace Mr Taylor as chairman of Courtaulds Textiles.)
Age difference apart, the two men are rather similar: thoughtful and
intellectual in approach, courteous in demeanour. Sir Christopher was
undisputed master of Courtaulds, and could allow the young Taylor to blossom
under his tuition. Indeed, Mr Taylor's move to Barclays has been materially
assisted by Sir Christopher's willingness to step back into his shoes.
'There's been tremendous co-operation between the two companies,' Barclays'
chairman remarked yesterday, 'with Christopher Hogg at the heart of that.'
At Barclays, by contrast, Mr Taylor may be entering a more hostile world. He
can doubtless rely on the support of Mr Buxton, the chairman, whose position
recently has come under fire. If Mr Buxton's position were as
unchallengeable as Sir Christopher's, he would not have needed Mr Taylor in
the first place.
As it is, Mr Taylor faces three main challenges. The first is whether he
will be able to work amicably and effectively with the other senior
executives. The second is whether he will be able to improve the quality of
management, both within its traditional banking operations, and its BZW
investment bank. The last is whether he will to agree the correct strategic
decisions with Mr Buxton over the next five years.
The challenge of fitting into the bank's senior management structure is
considerable. Apart from Mr Buxton and Sir Peter Middleton, the deputy
chairman, Mr Taylor will be trying to work with the chief executives of the
three divisions: banking, BZW and the technology-related service businesses.
The relationship with Sir Peter has been the subject of most speculation,
since he is the one senior executive who will not report directly to Mr
Taylor.
Mr Taylor is at pains to downplay such talk, pointing out that Sir Peter has
already offered to hand over his main area of executive responsibility
within the bank as a whole, its management of risk. 'When I saw Peter last
week, he said he wanted to hand it over and I said 'not yet please',' he
says. He also argues that the formal structure is less important than the
working relationship that will evolve.
Mr Buxton makes a similar point. 'We actually wrote the job descriptions for
myself and the chief executive down when we started the search, but when it
comes to the crunch, you cross the lines of whose job something is all the
time,' he said. Yet some observers believe the potential for Mr Buxton to
seek guidance on strategy from either Sir Peter or Mr Taylor when difficult
questions arise could be a source of tension.
Mr Taylor's relationship with the heads of the operating divisions is
crucial to his second challenge of improving management. The fact that he
will be in charge of seasoned - and older - bank executives may have played
some part in Mr Buxton's preference for someone from outside banking rather
than a directly comparable executive. He says that the bank had to find
someone who would command instant respect.
'I veered towards having a non-banker, but someone with really good
management experience that could be seen in his track record,' he says. Yet
the complexity of Barclays means that Mr Taylor will have to come to grips
with more than one different business. At the same time, he will have to
avoid offending executives such as Mr David Band and Mr Alastair Robinson,
the heads of the BZW and banking divisions.
Mr Taylor displays the most excitement when talking about the task of
raising the standards of customer service. 'It is stupendously difficult,
maybe the most difficult challenge of the job,' he says. He arrives as the
bank is experimenting with new ways of delivering services such as telephone
banking, and concern among senior managers that this could be upset by a new
chief executive.
He also faces the problem that some staff could regard his record as hatchet
man at Courtaulds Textiles askance. There is also the question of whether he
will interfere counter-productively. He is cautious on this. 'It may be that
the banking division is already doing everything that could be done. I would
be surprised,' he says.
The task of managing BZW is entirely different, since the investment bank
comprises many talented but temperamental dealers and advisers. Mr Taylor
argues that no British bank has yet discovered the full secret of managing a
securities operation. 'These are relatively new kinds of organisation, and
there's no template for them,' he says. 'Some people think there's a magic
ingredient called management which can be added. I am sure management has a
role, but I am not sure what it is. I am looking forward to finding out.'
Others are less sanguine. A senior executive at another bank says the new
chief executive will have a difficult task working with Sir Peter Middleton,
made worse by the fact that Sir Peter has an executive niche at BZW.
Internal tensions, he claims, are being caused at Barclays by the fact that
some old banking operations, including the treasury division, have been put
under BZW control. 'It is getting a bigger and bigger problem,' he says. 'It
is the tail wagging the dog.'
These are questions which Mr Taylor will face immediately, and the answers
may emerge quickly. But the crucial difficulty of judging his performance at
Barclays will be that banks are inherently cyclical businesses. The bank is
in the middle of an upswing in earnings which will probably last until 1996
as the bad debt problems from loans made in the late 1980s recede and
operating performance picks up.
Mr Taylor accepts that he can hardly claim much credit for what happens
next. 'There is no way that someone coming in like me will affect profits
over the next 18 months,' he admits. Yet there is little doubt that Barclays
faces large strategic questions that will determine how well its profits are
sustained. Lloyds' decision to divest poorly-performing business in the
1980s helped protect it in recession.
Mr Buxton agrees with this. 'There are one or two strategic decisions every
10 years that can make a big difference,' he says. Barclays made a big error
in the late 1980s by expanding property lending. But he says that the bank
made strategic errors in growing unwisely from the 1960s and 1970s onward.
'Our UK bank has produced some pretty high returns, but they were wasted in
some places overseas,' he says.
Yet the division of labour mapped out between Mr Buxton and Mr Taylor lays
primary responsibility for strategy with the chairman. Mr Buxton says Mr
Taylor will play a far larger role. 'Strategy will be very actively worked
out between us. It is not something a chairman can decide by sitting in his
office, writing it on a sheet of paper and handing it out to the chief
executive to implement,' he insists.
So Mr Taylor faces a curious mixture of tasks over various timescales. It
will keep him busy for a while: but not, one assumes, for ever. It is a
curious instance of his methodical approach that he had already decided to
move on from his executive role at Courtaulds Textiles before he was even
approached by Barclays. At the outset, he had given himself seven years for
the job, and his time there was coming to an end. So how long does he give
himself at Barclays?
Ten years, he says. 'One of the nice things about not being ridiculously old
is being able to come to a place like this and say I've got plenty of time.
Personally, that is. How much time the market will give me is another
question.'
And then what? Chairman of Barclays? Ruler of the world? 'Come back and ask
me in the year 2004', he says. And in any case, the date is not to be taken
too literally. 'Ten years,' says the ex-Mandarin scholar, 'is Chinese for a
very long time.'

FT  20 AUG 93 / Leading Article: Focus at Kodak
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
GOOD CORPORATE governance requires much more than a management board which
is studded with successful independent directors. The latest and in some
ways one of the most striking examples is to be seen in the story of Eastman
Kodak, a world-class company which over the past 20 years or so seems almost
to have gone out of its way to dissipate its resources. Now the price is
being paid. Earlier this month, its chairman resigned: this week, the
company announced that a further 10,000 jobs are to go by the end of 1995.
Kodak's culture is straightlaced and serious minded. Around its boardroom
table sit the likes of Coca-Cola's Roberto Goizueta, former chairman of the
New York Stock Exchange, John Phelan, and Dr Karlheinz Kaske, recently of
Siemens. Its core business, silver halide photography, has continued to
expand over the years, and its research efforts have been productive.
Yet its catalogue of strategic errors will stand as a casebook of the ways
in which a corporation could go wrong in recent decades. There was
complacency in the face of new competition from instant photography and from
Japan, followed by debacle when its move into Polaroid's territory brought
losses and heavy fines for patent infringements. There was the failure to
exploit technological leads in areas like reprographics and publishing
systems: inevitably, there was the enormously costly aquisition of a
business about which it knew nothing.
These grim experiences have forced Kodak to reappraise its activities, and
as a result it now appears to be regaining ground in some of its
long-established business lines. But its story shows how feeble the business
establishment can be when its own cage needs shaking. Kodak's non-executives
and its shareholders sat around politely through years of visible decline.
Someone should have been prepared to be ungentlemanly years ago.

FT  20 AUG 93 / Leading Article: Barclays' man
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IF A Hollywood casting director were asked to find someone to play the
stereotypically reassuring banker, he would probably go for a man with an
air of avuncular probity and enough white hair to compensate for the lack of
a university education. Mr Martin Taylor, who is about to abandon his role
as chairman and chief executive of Courtaulds Textiles for the chief
executive's job at Barclays, could hardly be more different.
At a youthful 41, he suffers from a sharp intelligence, an Eton and Balliol
pedigree and an early career in journalism, which is close to being a fatal
handicap in commercial life in Britain, if not elsewhere. He also differs in
another crucial respect from his future colleagues: he has run a quoted
British company in an internationally competitive sector of industry with
notable success.
If executives have crossed the line from industry into banking fairly
infrequently, it is because the job of the deposit-taking and lending banker
has traditionally been regarded as a specialist task. But as banking has
moved from a cartelised, highly regulated business towards a more
competitive, profit-maximising ethos, the skills of the industrialist have
become increasingly relevant, notably in areas such as costing and financial
control. The industrialist's skills are even more relevant when, as in Mr
Taylor's case, he comes from a mature industry that has already confronted
uncomfortable decisions. In banking the broad strategic choices are by now
well understood, but there are plenty of difficult nettles that have yet to
be grasped.
Equally striking is the way in which the prudential culture of commercial
banking has been eroded by the increased pressure for profits. The vast sums
lost in Latin America and in property provide overwhelming evidence to that
effect; and that alone would suggest that the old view of industrialists, as
being too red in tooth and claw to be put in charge of fiduciary deposits,
is anachronistic. Nowadays it is the bankers who inspire less confidence.
Yet it is important that those who do cross the fence from industry should
grasp why it is that banking remains fundamentally different. For a start,
the cost of any given misjudgment is magnified by the enormous leverage in
bank balance sheets: a small wedge of capital supports a huge edifice of
assets and liabilities. Another peculiarity of banking that exerts pressure
in an equal and opposite direction is that big clearing banks will never be
allowed to go bust. It follows that the chief executive of a clearing bank
is, in effect, in a role of public trust and should recognise an implicit
duty to the taxpayer in the way he runs the business.
In the final analysis, then, the test for Mr Taylor is as much a matter of
judgment as of managerial expertise. He has to resist the temptation to
outgrow the competition for the sake of it. The gravitas and grey hair will
no doubt follow.

FT  20 AUG 93 / Letters to the Editor: Spare a thought for European
non-smokers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ONESIMO ALVAREZ-MORO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Dr M Singer should spare a thought for us European non-smokers who will not
be returning to a country where smoking has been made almost
unconstitutional (Letters, August 18 and 19).
If a substantial majority of European residents are non-smokers, as
statistics suggest, then the European tourist industry has a much bigger
market to think about than Dr Singer suggests. Unfortunately, things move
slowly and, while we are delighted to welcome Dr Singer back to our shores,
US tourist dollars will probably not cause the changes required.
The real changes to protect non-smokers will happen when that silent
majority stands up and complains. Otherwise we will have to continue to rely
on vocal US tourists and the one or two of us who are labelled as cranks.
Far from being an American pleasure, as Dr R M Davis suggests, smoking can
be described as the true Montezuma's revenge, given all the death and
destruction it has caused.
But come back to Europe soon, Dr Singer, European non-smokers need all the
help we can get.

FT  20 AUG 93 / Letters to the Editor: Speculation an inevitable result of
ERM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Prof STEVE H HANKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your editorial, 'An entente that remains elusive' (August 12),
concludes that the French and Anglo-Saxon views about currency speculation
are in sharp contrast with each another. The French treat speculative
activity as immoral whereas Anglo-Saxon countries consider it a legitimate
and integral part of the free-market process.
The ink had not yet dried on your editorial before Mr Edouard Balladur,
France's prime minister, confirmed your thesis. Indeed, on the evening of
August 12 Mr Balladur castigated speculators and called for reforms to clamp
down on them President Francois Mitterrand joined the French chorus the next
day when he said: 'I find it insane and immoral that speculation, using
billions of dollars, can have its way against states representing their
people's interests and upset the daily life of millions of people'
('Mitterrand lashes out at speculators', August 16).
That French attitude is nothing new. In the good old tradition of the
'terror', Mr Michel Sapin, France's finance minister in the most recent
socialist government, reacted to the events of September 1992 with remarks
that were destined to gain him a prominent place in the foreign exchange
annals. He said: 'I will fight, we will fight, France and Germany will fight
this speculation, which is based on no economic fundamentals. During the
French Revolution such speculators were known as 'agioteurs' and then were
beheaded.'
Alas, whenever their currencies are weak, politicians on the Continent
embrace primitive ideas about speculation and concomitant conspiracy
theories. This is an old and venerable tradition. For example, towards the
end of the 16th century the Hanseatic League, the association of merchant
towns in northern Germany, then on the decline, accused the Merchant
Adventurers, English businessmen specialising in imports, of immoral
speculation against the league's currency.
Using speculators as scapegoats is just a pathetic ruse to cover up bad
government policies. If politicians were consistent they would not only
criticise speculators when currencies were weak but would also sing their
praises when currencies were strong. That, of course, would be absurd.
Government policies, not speculators, cause currency values to fluctuate.
Speculators are just the messengers who deliver the news.
In the interest of elevating understanding about exchange rate regimes the
French politicians should eat some humble pie, eschew their planned summer
reading and delve into serious economic literature. A recommended point of
departure is 'Achilles heels in monetary standards', in the American
Economic Review, March 1940. That classic article by Professor Frank D
Graham describes why pegged but adjustable exchange rate regimes, such as
the exchange rate mechanism, open the floodgates of disruptive, almost
riskless, speculation because 'sure things never lack enthusiastic takers. .
. including banks that are shrewdly administered'.
Until the ERM is abandoned to the proverbial dustbin of history we will see
the same scenario repeated over and over again.

Sir, First we were told that tax cuts would benefit the poor through
'trickle-down'. Now it is 'improved incentives for entrepreneurs'.
However, in his article 'The case for redistribution' (August 16) Michael
Prowse unwittingly confirms the suspicions of those who think such arguments
are simply a cloak for naked self-interest on the part of the journalists

FT  20 AUG 93 / Out of pocket for making the grade: Good A-level results may
mean students paying more for university education
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's A-level examination results, which yesterday showed more pupils
passing and at better grades than ever before, have intensified a funding
crisis at universities. Ironically, this success will almost certainly mean
other students having to pay at least part of their tuition bill in the
future.
Universities have made more offers of places than they can afford. No
student who has fulfilled the conditions set will be turned away this year,
but universities will reject more candidates than usual who have only
narrowly missed their target results. Unless more money can be found, next
year they will reduce the number of places on offer.
The latest dilemma for universities comes after a war of attrition with the
government over funding that has lasted since the early 1980s. Ministers are
eager for more students to enter higher education, but have not addressed
the other side of the equation: how the extra places are to be paid for. Mr
John Patten, education secretary, who should return to his desk on Monday
after a period of illness, knows that to put fresh burdens on middle-class
parents would add to the government's political woes.
Political decisions taken in apparent haste have not helped. The problems
created by the A-level results follow a cut in government funding for
classroom-based (mainly arts) subjects announced last December, when most
offers for places for the 1993-94 academic year had been made.
Adding to the pressures, applications for the academic year about to begin
have increased by between 6 and 7 per cent. And yesterday's results show
that the proportion of A-levels passed with one of the top three grades -
usually required by universities - rose by 1.6 per cent.
Something must now give. The most likely result is that those universities
that have to accept more students than they can afford this year will cut
back the offers they make next year by several thousand.
Such forces lie behind the report today of the Committee of Vice-Chancellors
and Principals on alternatives for raising extra finance for higher
education from students themselves. Without extra funds from somewhere, the
committee warns, the ideal of mass higher education, as envisaged by the
Lord Robbins' committee of inquiry report in 1963, would have to be
abandoned. University heads will debate the various forms of taxes on
graduates and announce a favoured alternative at the end of a meeting of the
vice-chancellors committee on September 23.
For the government, the prospect of raising an extra tax, even if it affects
only one section of the population, is not appealing - particularly one that
is likely to hit more affluent families the hardest.
In 1984, faced with a revolt by backbench Tory MPs and by many middle-class
parents, the Thatcher government executed a climbdown over the then
education secretary Sir Keith Joseph's proposal that students should pay
towards their tuition. With a smaller parliamentary majority, Mr John Major
will be reluctant to risk a repeat of that episode.
So the 'awkward game of tennis', as one vice-chancellor puts it, between the
government and universities, over who should take responsibility for a
decision on raising funds from students, has continued.
An earlier shot came in May when vice-chancellors requested an extra Pounds
3.2bn for capital spending on top of sums already announced for 1993-94.
They claimed Pounds 1.35bn of capital funding was needed just for backlog
maintenance to buildings. It also asked for Pounds 581m for capital spending
on teaching, and 55,000 more student beds over the next three years, at a
cost of Pounds 818m.
With the public sector borrowing requirement already approaching Pounds 50bn
the request was unrealistic, as the committee knew. But the intention was to
publicise the amount that universities needed, and to make it clear that the
money would have to come from elsewhere if necessary.
In June, Professor John Ashworth, head of the London School of Economics,
unveiled a plan to make LSE students pay top-up tuition fees, with
means-tested bursaries for those with difficulty paying.
To the government, his announcement opened up the possibility of
universities shouldering the opprobrium for introducing fees. Mr Tim
Boswell, higher education minister, refused to block Prof Ashworth's plan,
although he denied he would encourage it. In the end, the ruling academic
board of the LSE voted against the proposals.
Today the vice-chancellors' committee has taken the debate further by
suggesting four methods of raising money from students, which would all
delay payment until the students have graduated and are earning salaries.
The idea is that the income of a pupil's family should have no impact on
their decision to apply and that graduates who choose not to seek higher
paid jobs should not be disadvantaged.
The options are:
A graduate tax. Graduates would pay a higher rate of income tax than
non-graduates throughout their working lives. Graduates could start paying
the extra tax once their income had passed a certain level. All funds raised
from the tax would be earmarked for universities. A tuition fee paid through
a loan. Repayments would be made via higher income tax payments, as with a
graduate tax, so those with lower incomes would take longer to repay. London
Economics, the consultancy which produced the report, suggests funds could
be provided by either the Treasury or private banks, with the government
guaranteeing against defaulting. A similar system has recently been
introduced without great controversy in Australia.
A fee for students' living costs again paid with a loan, repayment of which,
made after graduation, would be linked to the tax system. Under this scheme,
students would decide the size of the loan they wished to take out. Top-up
tuition fees, again with a loan linked to the tax system. Institutions could
exercise an option to set fees higher than those provided for by the public
finances. This could add a controversial extra dimension to competition
between universities.
Although the report does not make a definite choice, it appears, on criteria
such as cost, flexibility and acceptability, to favour the Australian-style
system of tuition fees paid via state-subsidised loans. The graduate tax
would raise the most revenue and be the cheapest to administer, but London
Economics says it is the option likely to be opposed most by students.
All the schemes, with the exception of the graduate tax, would require
significant government subsidies, in the form of cheap loans.
University principals are pressing for an early government response to the
report. They point to the expansion in student numbers over the past four
years, resulting from a deliberate government policy of promoting higher
education and, until this year, increasing Treasury subsidies for tuition
fees. In England, the number of students has risen by 46 per cent to 753,000
in the past four years, according to the Higher Education Funding Council -
equivalent to creating 20 new large universities the size of those at Leeds
and Manchester.
Faced with the public finance squeeze, the government wants expansion to
slow down. Hence its decision to cut tuition fees this year. The distress
felt by this week's A-level candidates has revealed the crudeness of the
government's control mechanism.
With the publication of today's report, the ball is back in the government's
court. It must make a decision soon if the benefits of Britain's swift
expansion are not to be lost.* Review of Options for the Additional Funding

FT  20 AUG 93 / Letters to the Editor: Chemicals industry improving its
record
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JOHN C L COX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The UK chemicals industry is one of Britain's most successful
manufacturing sectors and one of the most frequently criticised on
environmental issues. Yet it is almost certainly the sector most publicly
committed to improving its environmental performance
Since 1989 the industry has adopted the international Responsible Care
voluntary programme for performance improvement in health, safety and
environment matters. My association represents most of the UK industry and
membership is conditional upon participation in the Responsible Care
programme. We have just published, as a first for UK industry, a three-year
range of Responsible Care performance data for the industry. We intend to
publish more.
Deepening recession may have caused environmental priorities to wane
elsewhere but not in the chemicals industry. Despite the recession the
sector has continued to spend an increasing percentage of its total capital
outlay on environmental protection. Indeed, in 1992 the industry made
capital and operating expenditure totalling Pounds 1bn on environment
protection. Less than 55 per cent of that was required in order to comply
with legislation.
There are a range of problems associated with developing and implementing
environmental legislation at European Community and UK government level,
both for the lawmakers and for industry. The chemicals industry continues to
work with legislators to help create a civilised policy on the environment.
We are making much progress towards an accord on what is desirable and
workable.

FT  20 AUG 93 / Airlines must fly solo: The US government will not rescue
the industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
US airlines, struggling after three years of heavy losses, once had high
hopes that the government would help them return to health. But now they
realise they will have to find their own cure.
A much-heralded report from a government commission on airline
competitiveness was not even off the presses before important
recommendations started to fall by the wayside.
Some of the more ambitious suggestions are widely viewed in Washington as
having only a slim chance of passing Congress - notably the proposal that
foreign companies should be allowed to raise their voting stakes in US
airlines to 49 per cent from 25 per cent. In the past, Both British Airways
and KLM, the Dutch national carrier, have had plans to take large stakes in
loss-making US airlines frustrated by this limit.
The commission also recommended exempting airlines from the new
transportation fuel tax included in President Bill Clinton's budget. But in
the search for revenues to wrap up a deal that would get the budget through
Congress, the exemption was trimmed back to two years only.
In many ways, the commission, set up in April, has come along too late. Its
recommendations have had no influence on the budget debate.
Above all, most big carriers have already taken significant measures to
restore profitability, by downgrading some expensive 'hub' airports, and
cutting domestic networks to concentrate on profitable routes. Others have
built up new sources of revenue from providing logistical and consultancy
services to other airlines.
It is as well that they have done so, for the commission concluded that the
airline industry's problems were not so much the result of structural
dysfunctions that could or should be remedied by government as of the
airlines' own mistakes.
The report notes that much of the decline in profitability has occurred in
short-haul markets because of competition from low-cost airlines.
'Average yield declines in these markets are not indicative of irrational
pricing behaviour, but of the fact that a large proportion of domestic
traffic flies in markets where these low-cost airlines operate. While this
development has depressed the yields and profitability of higher-cost
airlines in the short term, it is evidence of a dynamic competitive
process,' the report concludes.
This process has by no means worked itself out. Southwest Airlines, the one
leading carrier that has remained profitable, is expanding to the
north-east, and is currently engaged in a fare war with USAir which has seen
prices for a Baltimore-Cleveland ticket drop as low as Dollars 19.
The report also points the finger squarely at management errors. 'The
industry itself, primarily by taking on excessive debt, must bear its fair
share of the burden for its current state,' the commission writes, citing
the 1992 summer fare war, and a pattern of ill-timed expansions, as well as
the creation of too many connecting hubs.
Nevertheless, the report does identify some areas where government could
take measures to help the industry.
In the tax area, the commission concludes that the federal government places
a large and disproportionate burden on the airline industry, which should
'no longer be viewed as revenue generating machines for the government'.
Besides the recommended two-year exemption from the transportation fuel tax,
the report argues for rolling back the ticket taxes levied on airlines.
However, the current reluctance of Congress to pass anything which reduces
government revenues makes this proposal seem unlikely to generate much
support. Scepticism over congressional reaction is shared by the
International Air Transport Association, which represents most of the
world's airlines.
More radically, the commission proposes a complete restructuring of the
Federal Aviation Authority as an independent corporation, which would remain
under government control but would have its own budget safe from raids by
Congress and would be able to issue bonds to finance capital improvements.
Such improvements are badly needed, the commission says.
It also advocates a satellite-based navigation and control system which
could save the airline industry Dollars 5bn a year through reduced delays
and improved routing.
The prospects for effective modernisation are not encouraging. The authority
is behind schedule and billions over budget on its 1982 modernisation plan.
The commission recommends a public-private consortium to develop and
implement improved technology.
In the international arena, the commission argues for a complete redrawing
of the patchwork of bilateral air traffic agreements that governs world
aviation, urging an effort to reach liberal multilateral agreements. The US
is in the middle of renegotiating a bilateral accord with the UK and is
about to start talks with Germany.
A multilateral air agreement is viewed by most industry observers as a
distant pipedream. The advantages of such an accord would accrue
disproportionately to the US. But it is unlikely to be agreed at all as long
as Congress remains reluctant to permit foreigners to own bigger shares in
US airlines.
In the end, the cure is in the hands of the carriers and their ability to
take advantage of a slowly improving economic climate. 'They have learned .
. . in the future they will be more conservative,' says Mr Clifford Winston,
an economist at the Brookings Institution, a Washington think tank.
