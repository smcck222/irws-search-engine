FT  13 AUG 93 / International Company News: Lufthansa back into profit as
cost-cutting takes effect

<TEXT>
LUFTHANSA, the German national airline, returned to the black in the second
quarter of this year with a small pre-tax profit of DM24m (Dollars 13.9m) as
its cost-cutting programme started to show results.
It said that some DM1bn had been saved since the wide-ranging recovery
programme began last August. This included staff cuts, curbs in pay rises,
more flexible pay structures and working agreements, and a streamlining of
its operations.
But the company, which is 51 per cent state-owned, made a loss in the first
half, although much reduced at DM221m. This compares with a pre-tax loss of
DM542m in the same period of 1992.
The airline said the real improvement in its first-half result was DM147m.
The other DM174m represented the effect of changes in the method of
depreciation introduced in the second half of last year.
'The gap between earnings and expenditure is slowly narrowing,' Lufthansa
said. Total spending was 5.5 per cent lower in the first half, with labour
costs down 8 per cent.
Passenger numbers rose by 4.6 per cent in the first six months to 14m, with
freight just 0.7 per cent higher at 564,000 tonnes. However, revenues from
flight operations were 0.6 per cent down at DM6.9bn. Lufthansa said prices
were still under pressure from 'excess worldwide capacity coupled with
fierce and, at times, ruinous competition'.
In the second quarter, the average price paid by passengers was about 8 per
cent less per kilometre than a year earlier, with cargo yields 6 per cent
lower.
Lufthansa said the number of its flights fell by 3.6 per cent in the first
half, while demand was 7.4 per cent higher, both expressed in
tonne-kilometres. The revenue load factor was 4.3 percentage points higher
at 67.4 per cent; the seat load factor was up by 4.2 percentage points at
64.3 per cent.

FT  13 AUG 93 / International Company News: KLM holds out against pressure
on margins
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
KLM Royal Dutch Airlines reported a small increase in net profit for the
1992-93 first quarter in spite of pressure on margins caused by a shift in
demand to tourist class seats.
The increase, to Fl 40m (Dollars 20.5m) for the April-June period from Fl
38m a year earlier, is due mainly to the fact that KLM no longer carries the
losses of its 20 per cent-owned US airline, Northwest, on its books.
Another factor was a 14 per cent drop in wages and related costs, due in
part to a 'premium holiday' on contributions to the airline's pension fund.
Mr Pieter Bouw, chairman, told the annual shareholders' meeting that talks
on forming an alliance with SAS, Swissair and Austrian Airlines were
continuing.
The airlines hoped to sign a memorandum of understanding in September, with
a definitive agreement expected before the year-end, he said.
In the first quarter, passenger numbers rose but this was offset by the
trend away from first class and business seats in favour of cheaper tourist
fares.
The airline is planning to phase out its first class cabins and to improve
the quality of business class instead.
Total traffic, measured in ton-kilometres, rose by a healthy 14 per cent,
but traffic turnover fell by 3 per cent to Fl 1.8bn. Total turnover was down
4 per cent at Fl 2.1bn, outstripping a 3 per cent decline in total expenses
to Fl 1.96bn.
Margins were also under pressure from price wars and the strength of the
guilder, and operating profit fell to Fl 151m from Fl 182m. But this was
compensated for by the narrowing in losses from minority-owned airlines to
Fl 7m from Fl 61m, following KLM's decision to write down the value of its
Northwest investment to zero last year.

IBM has filed a patent infringement lawsuit against Conner Peripherals in
the Federal District Court in San Jose, California, AP-DJ reports from
Armonk.
According to IBM, the suit charges Conner with infringement of nine IBM
patents relating to magnetic disk storage technology. The suit seeks both
damages for past infringement and an injunction to bar Conner from any
further infringement. IBM said it is also asking the court to declare that
certain specific Conner patents are invalid and not infringed by IBM.
Conner Peripherals said it was 'disappointed' that IBM chose to take legal
action rather than continue attempts to resolve the matter through
negotiation.

sell-offs

<TEXT>
TURKEY is for the first time to place blocks of shares in state companies
directly with foreign investors.
The Public Participation Administration, the government agency handling
state sales to the public, said that stakes in some 20 companies would be
placed with both foreign and domestic institutions at market prices.
The sales, which the PPA hopes to conclude by the year end, are expected to
realise around Dollars 380m.
The decision to make a secondary offering, rather than block tender or
initial public offering, reflects the new urgency attached to the
privatisation programme by Mrs Tansu Ciller, prime minister.
Brokers say that the move will allow foreign investors to take a position in
some of the large public concerns without disrupting the market, which
suffers from a lack of liquidity.
This is the first time that there has been a possibility of significant
foreign stakes in some of Turkey's traditional state monopolies.
The sales include 10 per cent of Eregli Iron and Steel, Turkey's flat-rolled
steel producer which has a 71 per cent share of the domestic market.
The government is also offering a 15.87 per cent stake in Petrol Ofisi, the
petrol retail operation.
This sector has seen cut-throat competition, with oil majors such as British
Petroleum, Shell and Elf setting up operations.
Petrol Ofisi recently formed a small marketing joint venture with Agip, the
Italian company.
Smaller stakes are offered in Petkim, the petrochemical corporation, and
Tupras, the refinery company.
The largest block on offer is the 5 per cent of Tofas, the Fiat
manufacturing joint venture which at present market values is worth
TL1,600bn (Dollars 138m).
Brokers say the PPA is trying to broaden the scope of the privatisation
effort ahead of a large sell-off of the important utilities.
Mrs Ciller also restated her plans to sell the telephone monopoly, which is
expected to raise Dollars 2bn.
Morgan Grenfell, the UK merchant bank, is understood to be advising the
government on the sale.

FT  13 AUG 93 / International Company News: Shareholders face up to
repercussions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE COLLAPSE in the equity of Ferruzzi Finanziaria is already having
repercussions on some of its biggest shareholders.
Mediobanca, the merchant bank leading the committee of Ferfin's biggest
creditors, is most exposed. Its 3.5 per cent stake in Ferfin, valued at
L123.3bn (Dollars 76m) at the end of last year, is now worth a fraction of
that amount.
Based on yesterday's official share price in Milan of L224.40, Mediobanca's
holding is now worth little more than L9bn. Based on the proposed new
nominal share price for Ferfin's for just L5 rather than L1,000 at present,
the holding would be worth a meagre L204m.
With the write-down imminent, even hardened analysts were unsure of the
'real' value of Ferfin with total borrowings of L28,838bn and losses of
L1,165bn in the first five months of this year.
Sai, a big insurance group, and Generali, Italy's biggest insurer, also face
a collapse in the value of their Ferfin holdings. Sai owns 2.46 per cent,
while Generali has 2.33 per cent.
The stock market yesterday took some account of that, marking down the
shares of all three of Ferfin's main shareholders. Mediobanca slipped almost
1 per cent to L16,129, while Generali fell by 0.78 per cent to L39,972 and
Sai dropped 0.34 per cent to L22,892.
Leading sufferers from the collapse in values are members of the Ferruzzi
family, which owns about 48 per cent of Ferfin through the Serafino Ferruzzi
family holding company. Their stake, formerly believed to be on the books at
L1,690bn, is worth far less now.
For many of the 49,000 small shareholders in Ferfin, seething at the plunge
in the value of their holdings, the fact that the Ferruzzis have suffered
the same fate is small recompense.

FT  13 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Turnround at Royal Insurance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ROYAL INSURANCE yesterday reported a sharp recovery in its interim results,
with pre-tax profits of Pounds 52m for the first six months of 1993 compared
with losses of Pounds 79m. Earnings per share rose to 9.3p against losses of
18.3p and the interim dividend is lifted by 25 per cent to 2.5p.
The City, however, appeared disappointed with the result, which fell short
of some more optimistic expectations. Following strong growth in recent
weeks the shares fell 11p to close at 333p.
Royal said that it would launch a new direct motor insurance subsidiary on a
national basis in September following a successful trial period of operation
in the north of England.
Like The Insurance Service, based in Bristol, Royal Northern Direct will be
a telesales operation, bypassing the insurance broker. TIS now insures about
one third of the 1m motorists insured by Royal and is growing rapidly.
Commenting on the results, Mr Richard Gamble, chief executive, said 'we are
definitely on our way back.'
Mr Gamble's appointment was accompanied by a change in management style at
Royal and the introduction of a more disciplined approach to underwriting,
including sharp increases in premium rates.
Pre-tax losses have gradually fallen from their peak of Pounds 373m in 1991,
with a recovery in the UK underpinning the improvement.
UK underwriting losses fell from Pounds 172m to Pounds 22m. The company
reported underwriting profits in household, personal and commercial motor
and commercial property, but they were offset by losses of Pounds 50m
(Pounds 100m) on domestic mortgage indemnity business. UK premium income
increased by 9 per cent to Pounds 836m (Pounds 769m).
DMI losses for the year are expected to reach Pounds 90m. Underwriting
losses at Royal Re, the reinsurance subsidiary, were also higher than
expected, reaching Pounds 45m (Pounds 26m).
Overall underwriting losses fell to Pounds 207m (Pounds 310m). Investment
income - at the general insurance subsidiary - rose to Pounds 250m (Pounds
235m) before loan interest.
Income from associated undertakings rose to Pounds 13m (Pounds 9m), while
losses on estate agency business fell to Pounds 6m (Pounds 9m). Profits from
life insurance fell to Pounds 25m (Pounds 27m).
Loan interest payments at holding company level amounted to Pounds 21m. At
the insurance subsidiary loan interest amounted to Pounds 3m (Pounds 19m),
long-term insurance profit Pounds 1m (Pounds 12m losses) and minority
interests losses of Pounds 2m (Pounds 2m profits).
Capital and reserves increased to Pounds 2.07bn (Pounds 1.5bn) and include
realised gains of Pounds 80m (Pounds 375m) and unrealised gains of Pounds
50m (loss of Pounds 184m).
At June 30 the solvency ratio amounted to 56 per cent, compared with 42 per
cent at end-December.

FT  13 AUG 93 / UK Company News: F&amp;C raises net assets but warns on US
growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOREIGN &amp; Colonial Investment Trust warned yesterday that 'Wall Street may
begin to falter', as it lifted its interim dividend by 2.7 per cent to
1.15p.
The UK's largest investment trust reported an 8.6 per cent increase in net
assets from 225.5p to 244.9p per share over the six months to June 30; the
year-on-year rise on June 1992's figure of 181.4p was 35 per cent.
The trust said: 'Unless President Clinton can demonstrate soon that he can
revive the economy, Wall Street may begin to falter.' However, Mr Michael
Hart, joint manager, was reasonably hopeful about other markets, including
the UK, where he has a target for the FT-SE 100 index of 3150-3200 by the
year end.
The recent enthusiasm for enhanced scrip dividends has proved a problem for
the trust. Such dividends give investors extra shares instead of cash; if
they subsequently sell the additional shares, the cash proceeds would be
higher than if they had taken the cash dividend alone.
Investment trusts, however, cannot distribute capital gains. The fear is
that if F&amp;C paid out cash received from the sale of enhanced scrip dividends
to shareholders, it might lose its investment trust status.
The Association of Investment Trust Companies is negotiating with the Inland
Revenue on this point. In the interim, F&amp;C has stopped taking enhanced scrip
dividends and will not distribute the proceeds from those scrip dividends it
has received until the point is clarified.
The trust said that it continued to attract new investors through its
savings plan, with the total number of shareholders up 14 per cent in the
first six months of the year to 64,861. However, the costs of operating the
plan led to a 21 per cent increase in expenses.
Total net assets were Pounds 1.29bn. Earnings per share were 2.26p (2.31p).
A final dividend of 2.3p is forecast to make a total of 3.45p (3.35p).
COMMENT
F&amp;C's investment management skills seem undiminished. The 8.6 per cent
increase in net asset value per share compared with a 5.5 per cent rise in
the All-Share Index over the same period; the trust's move back into Japan
has worked out well. That said, its success has been so well recognised that
the shares, unchanged at 255p yesterday, are virtually trading at asset
value. Add in the fact that many world stock markets are at an all-time high
and new investors face the risk of a 'double whammy' - falling assets and a
widening discount - if they choose this moment to buy. So there may be scope
for short term weakness in the share price; however, those who invest for
the long term or via the savings scheme, can probably rely on F&amp;C to steer
through the market ups and downs better than most.

FT  13 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Johnson Cleaners hits Pounds 8.7m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES IN Johnson Group Cleaners rose 13p to 835p as the dry cleaning
company reported a 17 per cent jump in interim pre-tax profits from Pounds
7.44m to Pounds 8.7m.
The results for the six months to June 26, struck on a 9 per cent increase
in sales to Pounds 81.7m (Pounds 74.8m), were largely due to currency gains
and the acquisition of a workwear rental company earlier this year.
The interim dividend is maintained for the fourth consecutive year at 7p,
while earnings improved from 22.54p to 28.04p per share.
Mr Terry Greer, chairman, said trading in both the US and UK remained
difficult, with dry cleaning sales and margins under continuing pressure.
Mr Greer was slightly more upbeat on prospects than in recent years,
however, hinting that the group might be ready to return to the acquisition
trail in the next year or so.
'There are signs of a tentative economic recovery, which must make us more
optimistic.' Yet, he added the caveat that Johnson had not seen 'evidence of
anything sustainable'.
Exchange rates added Pounds 290,000 to operating profits, while Imperial &amp;
Queen Laundries, acquired in January for Pounds 2.9m cash, contributed
Pounds 260,000.
These helped increase operating profits by 7 per cent to Pounds 9.2m. The
pre-tax figure was further helped by a Pounds 464,000 drop in net interest
charges to Pounds 591,000.
Mr Greer said the dry cleaning business in the US had been hit by the severe
winter and summer flooding. The franchise business continued to incur
losses, although lower than last year.
Workwear rental, which had improved in the first half, would be the focus of
growth in the US. This was likely to mean acquisitions in the next year.

FT  13 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Baldwin restores interim pay-outs
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Losses at Baldwin, the holidays, printing and properties group, widened from
Pounds 2.02m to Pounds 2.25m at the pre-tax level for the half year ended
April 30.
However, in view of the strong financial position of the group and the
current state of trading interim dividends are being restored via a 1.6p
payment.
The deficit was a direct result of the accounting policy of the tour
operating division which recognises revenue only on the departure of
customers on holiday. Since virtually all holidays take place in the second
six months 'there is little turnover and little profit' from this division
at the interim stage.
Turnover doubled to Pounds 8.4m and losses per share worked through at 9.03p
(7.98p).
Cash balances at period end stood at Pounds 5.4m (Pounds 4.5m).

FT  13 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Blagden tumbles to Pounds 3m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
PROFITS of Blagden, the packaging and chemicals group, fell from Pounds 6m
to Pounds 3.04m pre-tax for the 25 weeks ended June 27. Turnover was lower
at Pounds 116.9m, against Pounds 118.1m.
With a need for 'prudent husbanding' of group resources the interim dividend
is cut from 4.5p to 1.5p. Earnings declined to 2.7p (7.3p).
Turnover and pre-tax profits benefited by Pounds 10.2m and Pounds 600,000
respectively from the devaluation of sterling. Profits also included Pounds
617,000 from the sale of property.
The directors said comparison with the second half of 1992 was more
meaningful when turnover of Pounds 111.8m and pre-tax profits of Pounds
1.63m were achieved. They said set against these results the performance of
the first half of 1993 pointed to a significant recovery.
Operating profits of the packaging division fell from Pounds 6m to Pounds
4.06m while those from chemicals declined from Pounds 2.14m Pounds 1.44m.

FT  13 AUG 93 / UK Company News: TransAtlantic improves to Pounds 30m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRANSATLANTIC Holdings, the property and life assurance group which obtained
a London listing last year, yesterday announced a 7 per cent rise in pre-tax
profits from Pounds 28.1m to Pounds 30.2m for the six months to June 30.
Mr Donald Gordon, chairman, said there had been 'solid progress' by the
property sector and an 'excellent advance by Sun Life in a very challenging
life insurance environment.'
'Taking into account our ambitious future plans, the company looks forward
to realising some of its exceptional potential in the period ahead,' he
said.
TransAtlantic is owned jointly by Liberty Life, the South African life
assurance company, and Union des Assurances de Paris, France's largest
insurer. It owns 50 per cent of Sun Life Holdings, the UK life insurer, and
Capital &amp; Counties, the property company.
On June 2 the group announced that it held 3.01 per cent of Sun Alliance,
the UK insurer, as a 'strategic' investment. It said it was currently
concentrating its efforts in North America in its investigation of
opportunities to develop its interests in the international life insurance
business.
Property investment income from Capital &amp; Counties increased from Pounds 33m
to Pounds 36m.
Sun Life's new business results showed a growth in regular premiums of 36
per cent from Pounds 42.1m to Pounds 57.2m and a growth in single premiums
of 23 per cent to Pounds 1.04bn.
Net assets per share at June 30 stood at 272p, compared with 307p a year
earlier and 274p at December 31 1992.
A substantial take-up of the scrip dividend alternative for the 1992 final
resulted in a reduction in the tax charge from 30 per cent to 18 per cent.
This helped earnings per share rise 18 per cent from 5.08p to 5.98p. An
unchanged interim dividend of 6p is declared.

glass buy
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LILLESHALL yesterday launched a 1-for-3 rights issue, raising Pounds 9.67m,
to buy St Helen's Glass and eliminate net debt.
The building products and engineering group also reported an 11 per cent
fall in pre-tax profits, from Pounds 2.06m to Pounds 1.82m, for the half
year to July 2.
The new shares are offered at 125p. The shares yesterday rose 8p to close at
163p.
The acquisition of Chartadd, the holding company of St Helen's Glass, is
costing Pounds 6.25m, including Pounds 133,160 for the cancellation of
options held by senior managers.
This will be financed by 3.7m of new shares, raising Pounds 4.6m, Pounds
750,000 of unsecured guaranteed convertible loan notes; Pounds 117,031 in
cash and 484,497 shares not to be sold before the end of next year, except
in limited circumstances.
In the year to end-March St Helen's Glass made pre-tax profits, adjusted for
extra directors remuneration and other non-recurring costs, of Pounds
705,000 (Pounds 953,000) on sales of Pounds 14.7m (Pounds 15.3m.)
Lilleshall's results were restated to comply with FRS 3, showing the first
half of 1992 benefiting from exceptional credits which were not repeated
this year.
Sales were Pounds 31.3m (Pounds 25.7m). Earnings per share rose to 5.4p
(5.1p) and the interim dividend is lifted from 1.6p to 1.7p.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MOSAIC Investments, the licensing and design, display products and
specialist packaging group, is raising Pounds 2m through a placing and open
offer to invest in its core businesses.
The group also announced pre-tax losses of Pounds 1.98m for the year to
April 30 compared with profits of Pounds 3.87m. The loss was after
exceptional costs of Pounds 2.49m for reorganisation and redundancies and
expenses incurred in the May relisting.
Mr Hugh Sykes, chairman, said that having substantially completed the
restructuring the group was now trading profitably.
The 2.02m new 10p cumulative convertible redeemable preference shares have
been conditionally placed with Montagu Private Equity Investments.
Shareholders can apply for all the shares on the basis of one new preference
for every 17 ordinary held.
Turnover amounted to Pounds 31.2m (Pounds 48.6m). Losses per share came
through at 14.84p (13.98p earnings).
There is no dividend for the year; last time there was an interim of 3.75p.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The next flash point in the row between the board of Hoskins Brewery and
rebel shareholders who have requisitioned an extraordinary meeting is likely
to be today, when full year results from the USM-traded brewer are scheduled
for release.
The rebels, led by Mr Richard Holman who has a 7.4 per cent holding, plan to
call for the removal from the board of Mr Barrie Hoar, chairman, and his
brother, Robert, on grounds of their management record.
The company has not yet responded to the rebels and no date has been fixed
for the EGM. The move means the directors are facing their second hostile
EGM in two years, soon after last month's formal lapse and apparent collapse
of a plan to inject into Hoskins some assets and businesses owned by Mr Adam
Page, founder of Midsummer Leisure.

FT  13 AUG 93 / UK Company News: 20% rise at Micro Focus ends growth
speculation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MICRO FOCUS, the computer software company, yesterday put an end to
speculation which has dampened its shares in recent months with results
showing a 20 per cent rise in pre-tax profits from Pounds 9.63m to Pounds
11.6m for the six months to July 31.
The growth, on sales up 33 per cent to Pounds 40.8m (Pounds 30.6m), of which
more than half were in the US, was due to a weaker pound. In dollar terms
pre-tax profits fell from Dollars 17.6m to Dollars 17.4m.
The shares rose 8p to close at Pounds 18.23.
Mr Paul O'Grady, chairman and, as of yesterday, chief executive, rejected as
unfounded the recent speculation over a permanent halt in earnings growth.
Analysts had misinterpreted signals over difficulties in the first quarter,
he said.
Micro Focus had suffered production support problems which had been sorted
out in the second three months.
'I think we have turned the corner,' Mr O'Grady said. 'It was much better in
the second quarter.'
Net income per share was steady at 80 cents, which Mr O'Grady said had been
well flagged in advance as a temporary consolidation. 'Our feeling is that
the growth is there and we will give it a really good shot to make it happen
in the second half,' he said.
In sterling terms earnings per share were 55.3p (45.9p). As in previous
years, and according to US practice, there is no dividend.
Cash reserves were Pounds 53.3m at the end of the period, similar to last
year.
Spending on research and development increased Pounds 5.3m to Pounds 7.4m.
COMMENT
Fears over a halt in earnings growth at Micro Focus appear to have been
over-hyped. Indications are that trading growth in the second quarter was
substantially better than the first three months. However, the group still
has to prove that it has fully recovered from the early hiccough. Perhaps
this lies behind Mr O'Grady's decision to take to the road as chief
executive and drive the sales growth himself. The numbers this time were
disappointing enough to pull forecasts back from roughly Pounds 31m to
Pounds 27m. On a prospective p/e of 14.5, the shares already seem to be
carrying most of the bad news.

FT  13 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Hong Kong's contribution rises to Pounds
122m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STANDARD CHARTERED has disclosed for the first time the proportion of
profits flowing from Hong Kong. Over the last 12 months it has raised assets
from Pounds 8.35bn to Pounds 11.2bn and for the six months to June 30
reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 121.7m, against Pounds 92.4m, writes John
Gapper.
The bank has been trying to reduce risk by cutting exposure to commercial
lending in Hong Kong, which accounted for more than half of profits in its
core Asia Pacific franchise. Other Asia Pacific countries produced Pounds
82.3m (Pounds 52.7m).
About 20 per cent of the Hong Kong assets are now in home mortgages. The
bank believes risk is limited by the fact that the average proportion of
loan to property valuation is below 60 per cent, and loans are usually
repaid in seven years.
Bad debt provisions in Hong Kong totalled Pounds 3.2m (Pounds 28.7m), while
that for other Asia Pacific countries was Pounds 2.2m (Pounds 2m). This
compared with a Pounds 113.7m (Pounds 37.3m) charge for the UK, out of total
provisions of Pounds 127m (Pounds 118m).
Losses in the Middle East and south Asia were cut to Pounds 7.3m (Pounds
98m). The bad debt charge fell to Pounds 1m (Pounds 102m) because it did not
make further provisions against its involvement in the Bombay securities
trading scandal.
The reduced loss was after taking account of a Pounds 21.4m charge for
writing down the value of public sector utility bonds in India.
In Africa, pre-tax profits of Pounds 4.2m (Pounds 17.8m) took in a Pounds
13m adjustment for hyper-inflation in three countries.
The large UK debt provision left a Pounds 42.5m loss, against a profit of
Pounds 200,000. More than half of the provision concerned two large
corporate charges, believed to involve loans to Isosceles and Brent Walker.
Group expenses rose to Pounds 481.3m (Pounds 353m) although the rise in
income reduced the cost to income ratio to 62.1 per cent (67.7 per cent). Mr
Malcolm Williamson, chief executive, said this was unacceptable, although it
included restructuring.
Talks with Price Waterhouse had failed to resolve a Dollars 338m (Pounds
227m) dispute over its purchase of the National Bank of Arizona. Mr Patrick
Gillam, chairman, said the claim was being pursued strongly and was likely
to return to court.
The tax charge was Pounds 73m (Pounds 51m), an effective rate of 43 per
cent. Mr Gillam said this was higher than the bank would like because of UK
losses and the bank's current inability to benefit from some write-offs and
provisions.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES IN Standard Chartered, the international banking group, leapt 51p
yesterday to close at 949p after it disclosed a sharp rise in first half
profits helped by buoyant Asia Pacific operations, and eased fears that it
would need a rights issue.
Pre-tax profits for the six months to June 30 rose to Pounds 168.8m, against
Pounds 59.3m, with Pounds 121m contributed from Hong Kong. The provision for
bad and doubtful debts increased to Pounds 127m, against Pounds 117.6m,
after charges for UK corporate lending rose from Pounds 37.3m to Pounds
113.7m.
Fears of a rights issue to strengthen capital eased after its ratio of core
tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets was disclosed to have strengthened to
5.4 per cent, against 4.9 per cent, helped by retained profits of Pounds
70.5m (Pounds 10.9m losses).
The interim dividend is raised to 7.5p (7p), with earnings per share rising
from 2.4p to 37.3p. Mr Patrick Gillam, chairman, said Standard was starting
to solve 'years of inconsistent and generally low earnings'.
Standard has suffered from upsets, such as its involvement in the Bombay
securities trading scandal last year, which have given it an accident-prone
image. However, the shares have risen this year on optimism about its Asia
Pacific franchise.
Mr Gillam said the company had strengthened its senior management and was
now trying to focus businesses in OECD countries to support the Far East
operations.
Mr Peter Wood, the finance and risk director who joined the bank earlier
this year from Barclays, said the bank wanted to raise post-tax return on
equity above the 17 per cent in the first half to cover some inevitable
earnings volatility.
The bank's overall ratio of capital to risk-weighted assets rose to 10.7 per
cent, against 9.7 per cent. It has a further Pounds 372m (Pounds 443m) in
'surplus' tier 2 capital which it can count towards the ratio as core
capital increases.
Net interest income rose 41 per cent to Pounds 457m, against Pounds 323m.
Dealing and exchange profits, including foreign currency and metals trading,
rose to Pounds 106.5m (Pounds 48.9m).
The bank is thought to be concerned about the volatility of its share price
caused by illiquidity. Some 38 per cent of its shares are held in six
blocks, including Tan Sri Khoo Teck Puat, a Singapore investor who holds
14.94 per cent.

FT  13 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Richemont spin-offs are confident - Dunhill
and Rothmans shareholders receive restructuring plans for the new groups
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A DOWNBEAT announcement from Dunhill Holdings did not dent the confidence of
the other participants in the restructuring of the Richemont empire.
Shareholders were yesterday sent details of the proposed reconstruction of
the tobacco and luxury goods businesses into two new quoted companies and
the return of surplus cash to the shareholders of Rothmans and Dunhill.
The proposals will result in the creation of two new groups - Rothmans
International and Vendome Luxury Group.
The new Rothmans will comprise all of Rothmans' existing tobacco businesses
and certain tobacco trade marks currently owned or controlled by Dunhill or
by Richemont with cigarette brands including Rothmans, Dunhill, Peter
Stuyvesant, Craven A and Golden American.
Lord Swaythling, chairman of Rothmans, said the company continued to
experience recessionary conditions in the main world economies, political
uncertainties in certain of its markets and volatility in the currency
markets.
The competitive trading environment in a number of cigarette markets also
created uncertainties, although the new Rothmans had limited exposure in the
US, where traditionally high margins have been eroded by the cigarette price
wars.
He said: 'The new Rothmans group is, however, expected to benefit from
cost-efficiency measures already initiated. While the total volume of
cigarette sales in many markets is static or in decline, overall worldwide
tobacco consumption is increasing.
'This provides opportunities for international tobacco companies to sell
quality cigarette brands, particularly to markets where opportunities for
export or local production have been traditionally limited through import
restrictions, government policy or lack of convertible currency.'
Under the reorganisation, the luxury goods businesses of Dunhill will form
part of Vendome, the Dunhill tobacco trade marks will be transferred to the
new Rothmans and Pounds 75m cash will be returned to Dunhill shareholders.
Vendome said it would be one of the world's largest luxury goods groups with
a portfolio of premier brands. Its principal brands would be Cartier, Alfred
Dunhill and Montblanc, which together accounted for 85 per cent of the sales
of Luxco and Dunhill. The combined group's turnover would compromise:
jewellery 14 per cent; watches 38 per cent; writing instruments 13 per cent;
and leather goods 10 per cent.
Mr Joseph Kanoui, the Swiss chairman and chief executive of Vendome, said
bringing together Richemont's Luxco and Dunhill luxury goods businesses
under unified ownership would enhance their ability to shape and take
advantage of changes in the industry. He believed the combination of Luxco
and Dunhill would produce purchasing, distribution and other savings.
On prospects for Vendome, he said the strength of its brands and management
team, the geographical spread of its sales and the integration of
manufacturing and distribution activities should enable it to perform well,
in spite of the depressed economic conditions in some of its markets.
The board also believed that an improvement in economic conditions should
favour the Vendome group given that both Luxco and Dunhill have historically
grown at rates in excess of the economies of the principal markets in which
they operated.
Mr Kanoui said that, unlike Dunhill, Luxco had not adopted long-term hedging
policies because it believed the geographical spread of its activities gave
it a natural hedge against foreign exchange movements.
Meetings for shareholders in Rothmans and Dunhill will be held on September
7. Subject to their approval, dealings in the new Rothmans and Vendome
shares will start on October 25.
Shareholders with 1,000 Rothmans B shares will receive 1,000 new Rothmans
units, 500 Vendome units and Pounds 757 cash. Holders of 1,000 Dunhill
shares will receive 133 new Rothmans units, 749 Vendome units and Pounds 443
cash.
The cash element totals Pounds 525m, of which Richemont will receive Pounds
300m. Following the restructuring, it will own 61 per cent of Rothmans and
70 per cent of Vendome.

FT  13 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Smith &amp; Nephew at Pounds 82m but US clouds
outlook
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SMITH &amp; NEPHEW, the healthcare and consumer group, yesterday reported a 27
per cent increase in interim pre-tax profits to Pounds 82.3m on turnover 17
per cent higher at Pounds 483m.
Mr John Robinson, chief executive, said the group had achieved underlying
sales growth of 8 per cent, after adjusting for currency movements and a
Pounds 6m gain on the disposal of an Australian plastics business. Margins
held steady at 15.8 per cent.
Although many analysts said the profits for the half year to July 3 had come
in at the lower end of expectations, with healthcare growth less than
forecast at 9 per cent, Mr Robinson said he was pleased with the results.
'Sales and profits growth are the same as last year,' he said, 'despite
worsening market conditions.'
The group had also managed to reduce gearing from 25 per cent to 18 per
cent, leaving the way open for substantial acquisitions within the next two
years.
Growth in the healthcare division during the first half had been slowed by
uncertainty over health reforms in the US, where Smith &amp; Nephew makes 46 per
cent of turnover. Sales of surgically related products had fallen as
patients put off surgery until the government published the reforms. Mr
Robinson said the number of operations in the US had fallen by as much as 10
per cent. He stressed, however, that the uncertainty was not expected to
have a long-term effect on sales. 'We are confident that it will come back,
but it may be a month or two before that happens,' he said.
On a brighter note, northern Europe - including the UK - had performed as
expected. Asia was also proving to be a high growth market.
The interim dividend is lifted from 1.8p to 1.89p, payable from earnings per
share of 5.1p (4.2p).
COMMENT
Forecasts for Smith &amp; Nephew have been downgraded from Pounds 170m to Pounds
162m pre-tax, leaving a prospective p/e of 14, as the uncertainty over its
largest market seems set to cloud the short-term. Turmoil over currencies in
the Exchange Rate Mechanism are not likely to help the group. Longer term,
Smith &amp; Nephew is well placed in markets with strong growth potential -
cost-effective healthcare. Most encouraging is Mr Robinson's reassurance
that Smith &amp; Nephew will maintain underlying growth of about 8 per cent.
Taking those factors into consideration, there might be a better time buy in
the near future, but there is certainly no reason to sell.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
GREENALLS GROUP, the pub retailer and hotelier, has acquired JP O'Brien, a
Lancashire-based drinks wholesaler, for Pounds 3.5m, comprising 650,000
Greenalls shares, loan stock of Pounds 700,000, and the balance in cash.
O'Brien had turnover last year of Pounds 10m.
Mr Andrew Thomas, Greenalls' chairman, said yesterday that the deal would
increase the group's focus on wholesaling opportunities outside its own pub
estate.
'Our existing wholesaling business will merge with O'Brien's and the
resulting increase in scale will improve margins and increase its attraction
to suppliers', he said.

FT  13 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Rutland Trust develops thirst for soft
drinks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RUTLAND TRUST is enlarging its business services portfolio with the
strategically surprising acquisition of Ben Shaws, a soft drinks maker based
in West Yorkshire.
The initial consideration is Pounds 5.69m giving Rutland an 84 per cent
interest in a newly formed subsidiary, Orderport, with the senior management
team of Ben Shaws holding the balance.
Rutland is paying Pounds 2.84m in cash, Pounds 2.45m in loan notes and
Pounds 400,000 in shares.
Further consideration will become payable in 1995, depending on profits
before tax.
Mr Michael Langdon, chief executive, said: 'This is not the first time we
have made substantial investments in a field outside pure financial
services.'
Capital Industries, Rutland's separately quoted associate, last year bought
Samuel Jones, a manufacturer of laminated paper.
Mr Langdon said: 'Where we can enhance our shareholder value by using the
skills we have at Rutland then we will invest.'
Mr Langdon and another Rutland director, Mr Christopher Dowling, have become
respectively chairman and deputy chairman of Ben Shaws.
Ben Shaws, which incurred pre-tax losses of Pounds 546,000 on turnover of
Pounds 66m in the year to end January 1993 and had net assets of Pounds 7m
at that date, has been owned and run by the Shaw family since 1871.

FT  13 AUG 93 / GPA rescue hits legal snag
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEGOTIATIONS between GPA Group, the aircraft leasing company, and GE
Capital, the financial services arm of General Electric of the US, have run
into legal difficulties, delaying completion of the deal.
Before any agreement is signed GE Capital has to satisfy itself that it will
not be held liable for GPA's Dollars 5.2bn (Pounds 3.5bn) debts.
The US group has agreed in principle to buy Dollars 1.35bn of GPA's
aircraft. The aircraft would be managed, with GE's own fleet, by a new
subsidiary run by several of GPA's existing executives.
GE Capital's lawyers want to satisfy themselves that the new subsidiary
could not be held responsible - by GPA's unsecured creditors for instance -
for any of the group's liabilities. Under the terms of the agreement the
debt would be left with GPA.
GE Capital's lawyers also wish to ensure that directors of the subsidiary
could not be seen to be 'shadow directors' of GPA, and thereby responsible
for the company's obligations. A senior negotiator in the deal said: 'GE's
lawyers are crawling all over the deal to ensure they can safely separate
the obligations from the operations.'
Mr Jack Hersch, research director at MJ Whitman, which specialises in
selling bank debt, said: 'It is a very fine line to separate the
responsibility for the operations from the obligations to repay debt'.
GPA's advisers had hoped to file the prospectus with Irish Companies House
on July 16 and hold an extraordinary general meeting this week.
Both companies now hope to solve the legal difficulties by early next month
followed by an EGM in October. GPA needs the support of holders of 75 per
cent of its shares.
The delay has also caused concern to some of the group's shareholders, who
are reluctant to raise all of the additional Dollars 150m originally
requested by GPA to ensure the deal's success. However, GPA now believes it
no longer needs to raise as much because its cash balances are stronger.
GE Capital's option, which is for 65 per cent of the group, could rise to 80
per cent if shareholders fail to raise additional funds.
Bankers to the group, however, remain confident that some shareholders, if
not as many as first envisaged, will take part in the underwriting.
The option, which is costing GE Capital less than Dollars 200m, can be
exercised as late as March 31, 1997.

FT  13 AUG 93 / Japanese group in deal with Pilkington
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PILKINGTON, the UK glassmaker, is selling a 20 per cent stake in Triplex
Safety Glass, its UK automotive glass subsidiary, to Nippon Sheet Glass of
Japan for Pounds 13.3m. Pilkington shares rose 5p to 149p.
NSG, the second largest flat and safety glassmaker in Japan, bought a 20 per
cent stake of Pilkington's US glass business, Libbey-Owens-Ford, in 1989 for
Dollars 230m.
Mr Roger Leverton, Pilkington chief executive, said the Triplex deal was of
great strategic importance. NSG was a leading supplier to Japanese carmakers
in its home market.
'We are trying to underpin the already substantial business we have with
Japanese transplants (Japanese-owned car factories) in the UK. The
relationship with NSG in the US has been very successful in strengthening
our links with Japanese customers there. We want to do the same in Europe,'
he said. In the US, LOF supplied a 'significant' part of the glass for
Japanese plants including Toyota, Nummi, Nissan and Honda.
Pilkington is already a leading supplier to Nissan and Toyota in the UK,
with 25 per cent of Triplex's sales going to Japanese manufacturers. Triplex
has been nominated as the glass supplier for the Nissan Micra.
A second motive for the link, Mr Leverton said, was a technology agreement
with NSG, which is expected to improve efficiencies and cut costs at
Triplex.
Enhanced profits at Triplex should more than compensate Pilkington for its
reduced stake.
The deal price of Pounds 13.3m - valuing Triplex as a whole at Pounds 66.5m
 -represented a 'reasonable' premium to net asset value, he said, which
would benefit Pilkington's balance sheet. One analyst said it was 'a drop in
the bucket' given Pilkington's high gearing.
Triplex, which has production sites in St Helens, Lancashire, and Kings
Norton, Birmingham, has an annual turnover of Pounds 80m.

FT  13 AUG 93 / Dunhill warns on currency
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A PROFITS warning from Dunhill Holdings and the cost of the luxury goods
group's foreign exchange policies yesterday cast a small shadow over the
corporate restructuring proposed by Richemont of Switzerland.
Richemont, controlled by the Rupert family of South Africa, wants to split
off the group's tobacco arm, Rothmans International, and combine its two
luxury goods businesses, Luxco and Dunhill, into Vendome. Dunhill is at
present a 57 per cent owned subsidiary of Rothmans.
Dunhill said that because 95 per cent of its business arose outside the UK,
it hedged future income up to 30 months ahead. Recent currency movements -
notably the strengthening of the yen - meant its sterling profits for
1993-94 and 1994-95 would be Pounds 19m and Pounds 13m lower than without
the hedging.
Operating profits were also likely to fall this year because of the drop in
Japanese consumer spending, weakening economies in Germany, Italy and Spain,
and only hesitant recoveries in the US and UK.

FT  13 AUG 93 / Papuan threat to RTZ sale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RTZ Corporation's Dollars 108m (Pounds 73.6m) plan to reduce its
shareholding in the Lihir gold project in Papua New Guinea - the largest
known gold deposit outside South Africa - was under threat yesterday from
the PNG government.
Mr Paias Wingti, PNG's prime minister, said the proposed sale by RTZ of part
of its 80 per cent share in the project to Niugini Mining and Venezuelan
Goldfields, a Canadian prospecting company, was 'in flagrant violation' of
his government's decision to take a 50 per cent stake.
Previously the PNG government had indicated it wanted 30 per cent of Lihir
but Mr Wingti said that RTZ had been informed in May that it would take 50
per cent and then hand on 20 per cent to a suitable partner.
RTZ, the world's biggest mining company, said some aspects of Mr Wingti's
statement came as a 'surprise'. It would discuss the situation with Niugini
Mining, based in Port Moresby the PNG capital, and with Vengold.
Mr Wingti said: 'This decision has been forced on the government by the
inordinate delays and procrastinations which have taken place over the last
10 years.' RTZ had repeatedly told the government that Lihir was not a
viable project. 'We in turn have now informed them that my government has
sufficient confidence in the property to retain 50 per cent.'
The Malaysian Mining Corporation recently said it had been offered 20 per
cent of Lihir by the PNG government. Yesterday Mr Masket Iangalio, PNG mines
minister, said MMC had offered to fund the government's 30 per cent stake in
Lihir and MMC officials would shortly visit the Lihir site, in the crater of
an extinct volcano.
The affair threatens to be embarrassing for RTZ, which prides itself on
being able to negotiate effectively with any government.
The dispute is likely to further damage PNG's reputation with investors.
Since Mr Wingti's government was elected last year it has been involved in
serious disputes over the Porgera and Mt Kare gold mines.

FT  13 AUG 93 / UBS leaps ahead by 89% in first half

<TEXT>
UNION Bank of Switzerland, one of the world's strongest commercial banks,
has reported an 89 per cent jump in first-half net income to SFr1.29bn
(Pounds 575.4m).
UBS said the result demonstrated its 'exceptional earning power', as buoyant
securities and volatile foreign exchange markets combined with favourable
interest rate trends.
It also expected a good second-half result, although it would be 'hazardous'
to predict that it would match the first.
The interim profit enabled UBS comfortably to surpass its mid-1990s target
of achieving a 10 per cent return on equity. With a return of about 13 per
cent, it is one of the world's most profitable big banking groups as well as
the soundest.
Its tier one capital ratio of nearly 8 per cent at the end of last year was
significantly higher than that of other large commercial banks.
The profit surge was powered by income from trading, which soared 144 per
cent to SFr1.55bn. Net interest income gained only 10.9 per cent to SFr1.9bn
and commission income was up 18.7 per cent, also to SFr1.9bn.
The contribution of foreign outlets, active only in wholesale banking and
trading, jumped to 40 per cent of total net income from just over 20 per
cent.
The group said its European region, dominated by offices in London, produced
60 per cent of the foreign contribution, with 20 per cent coming from both
North America and Asia.
Thanks to its top credit rating, UBS has become one of the main players in
the world's futures and options markets. Its volume of derivative products
amounted to SFr2,076bn at the end of June, 25 per cent higher than in
December. The average risk on this volume was equivalent to about 30 per
cent of the group's balance sheet risks.
The group's total assets stood at SFr290.7bn, only 9 per cent above the
year-end figure.
Customer loans grew only 3 per cent to SFr155.6bn, and most of the growth
came from outside recessive Switzerland.
Provisions for bad loans were raised by a third to SFr1.07bn. But UBS's
reference to 'our conservative policy' and to 'generous' provisions
signalled that it was, as usual, stuffing away as much as possible.

FT  13 AUG 93 / Mirror shares rise on report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MIRROR Group Newspapers is still substantially undervalued, according to a
study on the popular newspaper group's prospects by SG Warburg Securities.
Warburg expects that, despite the problems still remaining from the late
Robert Maxwell's ownership, margins will be improved by 2 per cent to 23 per
cent this year and a further 2 per cent next year.
The share price of the company - which publishes the Daily Mirror, Sunday
Mirror and People, as well as the Scottish Daily Record and Sunday Mail -
yesterday gained 8p to close at 167p.
Warburg, which is MGN's brokers, expected that, allowing for the future
resumption of dividend payments, the company would come more into line with
a normal media sector rating. This would imply a share price of 220p in
1994, it said.
The positive report on the company comes at a time of speculation that Mr
John Talbot of Arthur Andersen, the administator to the private Maxwell
companies, might be about to move on the disposal of 54.8 per cent of the
company.
This stake is effectively owned by a number of banks which lent to Maxwell.
A private placing in the autumn is seen as the most likely outcome, although
it is not clear whether a final decision has been taken.
In her report on MGN, Ms Lorna Tilbian, Warburg's media analyst argues that
the Daily Mirror has been only marginally hit by the price war with The Sun.
The report suggests that the underlying position, including normal seasonal
variations, will show only a 0.6 per cent circulation fall in July.
The Sun, which cut its cover price by 5p to 20p, will show a rise of only
123,000 copies, or 3.5 per cent, in average daily sales.
Ms Tilbian argues in the report that there now exists an opportunity for the
new management, under chief executive Mr David Montgomery, to inculcate a
culture of enterprise and efficiency to 'secure consistent earnings growth
for the foreseeable future'.

FT  13 AUG 93 / Peril of losing touch with the real world: Share prices are
soaring despite gloom in industry. Tony Jackson asks if the market is
heading for a fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The two headlines on the front page of yesterday's FT said it all.
Manufacturing recovery wavers, said the first. FT-SE 100 breaks 3,000 level,
added the second. To the outside eye, the stock market often seems to live
in an unreal world. In a week of gloomy industrial news and soaring share
prices, the sense of divergence has become acute.
For the market, the reasons for feeling cheerful are simple enough.
Britain's exit from the ERM last September was good news because it meant
lower UK interest rates and lower sterling. The collapse of the ERM was even
better, as it meant that other European countries - Germany of course
excepted - could cut interest rates as well. With luck, that would allow
Britain to cut its rates still further.
In theory, the effect of this on equities is twofold. First, lower returns
on cash mean that savers switch into equities. Second, lower interest rates
provide an economic stimulus, especially in continental Europe. The outlook
for European exports had been a matter of growing concern for UK
manufacturers, as expressed by the Confederation of British Industry shortly
before the ERM's collapse.
The snag about all this, of course, would be if the markets started worrying
about the resurgence of inflation. But the opposite seems to be the case.
The UK government bond market has been roaring away in recent weeks, to the
extent that the UK's nightmarish budget deficit looks like being funded well
ahead of expectations.
Back in the real world, on the other hand, nothing whatever has happened.
Interest rates have not come down significantly, in the UK or elsewhere in
the EC. The economic data remain mixed and confusing.
In the UK, for instance, it was announced yesterday that the recent fall in
unemployment was last month marginally reversed. Car sales across Europe
fell 20 per cent last month. Truck sales in the UK fell 11 per cent.
And companies have, on the whole, been gloomy about the outlook. On Tuesday
BOC, the industrial gases giant, said business with its basic industrial
customers around the world remained tough, and that profits would be down
for the year. Yesterday Rothmans, the tobacco and luxury goods group, said
it was still seeing 'recessionary trading conditions in the major world
economies'.
This could still all be a matter of timing. It is the function of the market
to discount the future, and its apparent divorce from reality is
characteristic of economic turning points. This leaves two further
questions: whether the market's expectations are right, and whether it is
putting the right value on them.
Less bullish analysts have pointed out that the price-earnings ratio of the
London market - one of the simplest methods of valuation - is now at around
the same level as in October 1987, just before the crash. The more bullish
response is that the outlook is wholly different. In 1987, the market was
right to be alarmed about the coming recession. Now, with luck, it is right
to expect an economic upturn and a corresponding surge in profits.
As for valuation, it helps to step back and consider the broader context. In
the long run, it seems unlikely that the market can outpace economic growth.
Share prices cannot rise faster than the dividends which give them their
value, nor can dividends rise faster than the profits from which they are
paid. Profits, in their turn, can scarcely rise faster than the economy, as
that would mean shareholders winning consistently at the expense of someone
else. Profits may at times lose ground and then regain it, as happened in
the 1970s and 1980s. But on a long view, this ought to amount only to
fluctuations around the economic trend.
The upper of the two accompanying charts shows GDP in the developed
economies of the OECD, expressed in current sterling, along with the FT
All-Share Index. The OECD is chosen because of the international nature of
British quoted companies. GDP is shown in current rather than real terms to
give effect to inflation, as share prices do.
The implications are on balance reassuring. The index rose above the
economic trend line in the early 1970s, before the horrendous bear market of
1973-4. It rose through it again briefly in 1987, just in time for the
October crash. Now, despite its recent strength, it is still below the
trend. This is partly because sterling's devaluation has jacked up the value
of the world economy in sterling terms. But it has also jacked up the
sterling value of Britain's overseas earnings, so the comparison remains
fair.
In the short run, there is obviously a risk that the good news which the
market expects will be slow in arriving, so that the excitement of recent
weeks evaporates. But again, that is merely a matter of timing.
The more fundamental question raised by this week's headlines is whether the
market has taken leave of its senses, as it did in the summer of 1987.
Judging by the chart, the answer is no. Or at any rate, not yet.

FT  13 AUG 93 / German car chief warns of further 100,000 job cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE GERMAN automotive industry must shed a further 100,000 jobs and cut
costs by between 20 and 30 per cent in the next two years if it is to
survive, according to Mr Achim Diekmann, chief executive of the VDA motor
industry association.
If vehicle and component makers did not regain competitiveness quickly, they
would disappear, he said.
The association could see no signs of recovery. German car output was
expected to drop by 18 per cent this year, compared with forecasts last
winter of a 10 per cent decline. This implies a fall from record production
of 4.86m cars in 1992 to about 4m.
The industry's expectations had been based on hopes of recovery in France
and Italy but new registrations in the first seven months of this year have
dropped by 24 per cent in Italy and 17 per cent in France.
German sales, expected to fall 20 per cent, are down almost 25 per cent so
far. In an interview with a German news agency, Mr Diekmann said the
domestic market would be hit again in early 1994 by a 16 pfennigs a litre
increase in petrol taxes.
This, the third increase within a short time, had come at the wrong moment
for the motor industry, he added.
German vehicle and component makers had already cut 95,000 jobs in the two
years to the end of June and were halfway towards the optimum workforce, Mr
Diekmann said. Extra demand from the former East Germany had disguised the
underlying downward trend and delayed structural changes.
Mr Diekmann said that in the first half of this year, when German factories
produced 2.1m motor vehicles of all types, a further 1m bearing German
brands were manufactured abroad.
Plans by BMW and Mercedes to open factories in the US and Volkswagen's
projected doubling of capacity in China foreshadow an acceleration in this
trend, industry officials noted.
At the same time, German components manufacturers are increasingly using
capacity outside Germany to supply transplant factories.
Mr Diekmann named no companies, but his opinions clearly matched those of
Volkswagen, currently embroiled in a spying controversy with Opel, German
subsidiary of General Motors.
VW, the second biggest industrial concern in Germany, is engaged in cutting
its domestic workforce by about 15,000 to 100,000 by the end of 1997.
Mr Diekmann's latest forecasts related strictly to the automotive industry
which employed 693,000 at the end of May.

FT  13 AUG 93 / Bosnia talks expected to restart: Serbs accept UN
arbitration but air strike preparations continue
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
INTERNATIONAL mediators expect the Bosnian peace talks to resume today after
the Serbs agreed to accept United Nations arbitration in a dispute over the
extent of Serb withdrawal from a strategic peak near Sarajevo.
The more hopeful signs came as Nato countries pressed on with military
preparations for possible air strikes against the Bosnian Serbs.
A United Nations spokesman in Geneva said that the mediators, Lord Owen and
Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg, expected a resumption this afternoon of the talks
between leaders of the three warring factions in Bosnia.
But Bosnia's Moslem president Alija Izetbegovic, who has boycotted talks for
12 days, gave no confirmation that he was ready yet to change his stand.
He reiterated earlier that he would not return to the Geneva talks with
Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic and the Bosnian Croat leader Mate Boban
until the Serbs completed their withdrawal from Mount Igman overlooking
Sarajevo.
However, UN arbitration in that dispute might end the impasse.
The UN spokesman in Geneva confirmed last night that Bosnian Serb forces
remain deployed in 'areas of Igman Mountain', but added that the troops 'did
appear to have left the centre of the area from which they agreed to
withdraw'.
Mr Karadzic claims that Serb forces can remain on parts of the peak seized
before a ceasefire agreement reached July 30. But after intensive sessions
with the international mediators, he agreed last night to accept UN
arbitration as 'binding' on a disputed line beyond which Serbs should
withdraw.
With Nato preparations mounting, General Francis Briquemont, commander of UN
forces in Bosnia, flew to a Nato air base in Italy yesterday to discuss the
logistics of air strikes with Admiral Jeremy Boorda, Nato's commander of
Allied Forces Southern Europe.
Italy later announced that it was sending more troops to reinforce its
border with former Yugoslavia to protect against possible reprisals in the
event of Nato bombing raids.
In a further escalation of tensions, Mr Karadzic was reported to have told
an Austrian newspaper that he would try to acquire nuclear weapons to carry
out attacks if the west pressed ahead with military action.
The comments were due to be published in Austria today.
But a spokesman for Mr Karadzic last night denied he made the threat.

FT  13 AUG 93 / The Lex Column: Rothmans/Dunhill
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The fine print of Richemont's asset reshuffle highlights the move's
industrial logic but the financial advantages from the viewpoint of
Rothmans' and Dunhill's shareholders are less clear. By untangling the web
of interconnecting shareholdings, Richemont will produce two businesses
separately focused on tobacco and luxury goods. Given the conspicuous clash
of corporate cultures between the two groupings, this is doubtless a good
thing.
As a pure tobacco company, Rothmans clearly has its attractions. The opening
of markets in eastern Europe and China has given tobacco companies revived
opportunities: Rothmans expects world cigarette consumption to grow by 2 per
cent a year to 5,700bn sticks by the end of the century. With Pounds 500m of
cash, Rothmans is strongly placed for expansion. However, its yield, which
is likely to languish well below that of BAT Industries, may hold the share
price in check.
Dunhill's minority shareholders, though, may reasonably gripe that their
interests are not best served by transferring their assets, valued at the
bottom of the cycle, into a bigger business over which they have diminished
control. The Japanese downturn has certainly resulted in a nasty scratch
across Dunhill's veneer. The company's currency hedging policies have also
left it looking rather reckless - even if the immediate result is more red
faces than red ink. But the unanswered questions remain: if Dunhill is as
relatively weak as the terms of this deal suggest, why were its shareholders
not aware of the fact; and why did its parent, Rothmans, not tackle the
problems earlier?

FT  13 AUG 93 / The Lex Column: Ferruzzi
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The news from Ferruzzi goes from bad to worse - as yesterday's collapse in
the share price after a two-day suspension demonstrates. The position was
desperate even before the additional losses in commodity futures trading
were disclosed on Tuesday. Since international auditors have now been
through the books, that could be the last of the nasty surprises. With an
investigation into alleged political bribes still in progress, though, the
stock market can hardly be blamed for assuming the worst.
Reasons for optimism are few and far between. The appointment of foreign
banks to the creditors steering committee offers some encouragement that
restructuring proposals will meet the expectations of overseas investors. By
forcing Ferruzzi to amend the terms of the proposed rights issue for La
Fondiaria, its insurance subsidiary, the Italian investment authorities have
also shown some teeth. If Tuesday's figures are correct, group companies are
generating decent operating profits despite the pain of the parent.
While such profits are still dwarfed by interest payments, that is reason to
hope asset sales might be achieved even in the current depressed economic
climate. On a sympathetic interpretation, the two-week delay in presenting
restructuring proposals might allow for the completion of the proposed sale
of Himont, the chemicals subsidiary, to Shell. It will, however, take more
than one disposal to restore financial balance.

FT  13 AUG 93 / The Lex Column: Standard Chartered
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
As talk of a rights issue from Standard Chartered always sounded a little
wild, its failure to materialise hardly provides an explantation for
yesterday's sharp share price rise. More plausible is the sense of relief
that another set of results figures had passed without further trouble.
Certainly the unexpected increase in provisions against well-known UK
problem loans was unwelcome, but investors were at least spared the
emergence of wholly new difficulties. The management's aim must be to
continue the encouraging profits' trend over the next 18 months, rebuilding
its tier one capital ratio above 6 per cent and its credibility with
institutions into the bargain. That would probably earn a credit re-rating
and open the possibility of an issue of dollar-denominated preference shares
to bolster its sterling capital base against shocks from the predominantly
dollar asset base.
If such a strategy looks sensible, the difficulty is that circumstances are
partly outside Standard's control. Boom conditions in the Asia Pacific
region may boil over in the next year or so, yet the bank's general
provision looks modest when set against its Pounds 22bn of assets in the
area. To be sure, the bank has recently shown restraint in Hong Kong in an
effort to boost profits. If Standard is fortunate and Asia holds up, then
there is room for some further improvement in its relative rating. Yet the
risk of disappointment remains - the new management says that it intends to
generate consistent earnings, but this is an inherently cyclical business.

FT  13 AUG 93 / The Lex Column: Royal returns
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
With the proceeds of May's rights issue safely tucked away, Royal can enjoy
the UK insurance recovery without worrying about its capital position.
Having cut the pay-out too, it should even be able to cover the dividend and
retain profits at the current modest level of profitability. The likes of
Commercial Union will have to wait for the next leg of the UK underwriting
upturn to flow through to the bottom line before such financial balance is
achieved. Yesterday's large loss in reinsurance is a reminder that past
mistakes might still take the shine off Royal's recovery, even where
remedial action has been taken. Given the unpredictable nature of the
business, there is certainly scope for further disappointment. But while
running down reinsurance at the bottom of the cycle attracted brickbats,
such losses support the argument that retail insurers have no place in the
wholesale end of the business.
Like others in the sector, Royal is coy about how its new financial freedom
will be used. Price rises in the UK should underpin premium growth for
perhaps another year. By then, the US underwriting cycle may at last be
turning. Royal is already reversing the steady shrinkage of its US
operations. But while big US insurers such as Chubb are showing decent
profits at current rates, price rises cannot be taken for granted. The
immediate outlook in Europe is equally uncertain. Since investment returns
are also likely to be lower than in the 1980s, insurers may have to content
themselves with squeezing the most out of existing business.

FT  13 AUG 93 / French reserves fall by FFr190bn: Deficit explains country's
caution in reducing interest rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING, JAMES BLITZ and QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS, LONDON, BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bank of France has been left with a substantial net deficit in its
foreign currency reserves as a result of its attempts to keep the franc
inside the European exchange rate mechanism at the end of last month.
Figures issued yesterday by Bank of France showed that the country's net
reserves fell by almost FFr190bn (Pounds 21.64bn) in the week to August 5,
leaving the central bank with a deficit of more than FFr180bn in its foreign
exchange holdings.
The franc slipped against the D-Mark yesterday after the central bank
figures were issued.
The Danish krone also fell sharply against the D-Mark amid signs that
Denmark also needed to replenish its foreign exchange reserves after the ERM
crisis.
The drain on French reserves will have been due almost entirely to the
central bank's intervention in the currency markets to try to keep the franc
above its former ERM floor against the D-Mark.
On July 29 alone, economists estimate the central bank spent more than the
FFr160bn used to defend the franc in its previous crises. The total amount
of reserves used by the French authorities in the recent crisis is estimated
at more than FFr305bn.
The franc closed yesterday at FFr3.514 against the D-Mark, about a third of
a centime down on the day. But at one stage, the currency was being bought
at FFr3.52.
The reserves data helped to explain France's cautious approach to reducing
interest rates since the widening of fluctuation bands within the currency
system on August 2. Economists said that if the French authorities were to
lower interest rates, the currency could fall against the D-Mark - but the
central bank would have no reserves with which to support the exchange rate
through intervention.
The krone came under even heavier selling pressure inside the ERM, in spite
of Denmark's announcement of a large offering on the bond market to help
replenish its foreign exchange reserves. The bond issue, worth SFr1bn
(Pounds .4bn) came in the wake of a Pounds 1.3bn Eurobond sterling offering
last week.
But news of this latest bond tender could not prevent the krone falling in

FT  13 AUG 93 / Signs grow for Nato air strikes as Serbs hold firm

SERB FORCES appeared yesterday to defy international demands to withdraw
completely from strategic heights around Sarajevo amid signs of mounting
military preparations for Nato air strikes.
General Francis Briquemont, commander of UN forces in Bosnia, flew to a Nato
air base in Italy to discuss the logistics of air strikes with Admiral
Jeremy Boorda, Nato's commander of Allied Forces Southern Europe.
Italy later announced that it was sending more troops to reinforce its
border with former Yugoslavia to protect against possible reprisals in the
event of Nato bombing raids.
Mr Fabio Fabbri, Italian defence minister, told a radio interviewer it was
necessary to 'strongly intensify' border controls to protect against
possible terrorist attacks.
Serb nationalists have threatened to retaliate against Italy if the Nato
aircraft based there are used to attack Serb positions.
In a further escalation of the tensions Mr Radovan Karadzic, Bosnian Serb
leader, told an Austrian newspaper that he would try to acquire nuclear
weapons to carry out attacks if the West pressed ahead with military action.
The comments were due to be published in Austria today. A spokesman for Mr
Karadzic last night denied he made the threat.
The US has warned the Serbs that if they did not leave the strategic
mountains around Sarajevo that they could face air strikes, agreed at a
meeting of the Nato council last Monday.
President Clinton's nomination of Gen John Shalikashvili, who is known to be
more favourable towards intervention in Bosnia, as chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff has fuelled speculation that Washington is moving towards a
stronger line on the conflict.
European diplomatic sources sought to play down the threat, stressing that
the prime consideration continued to be the peace negotiations in Geneva.
The talks, however, remained at an impasse. President Alija Izetbegovic of
Bosnia reiterated he would not return to the talks until the Bosnian Serbs
had completed their withdrawal.
Bosnian Serb leaders said they would not fully withdraw from Mount Igman
until the UN had given further assurances that the strategic heights would
remain neutral.
Although Serb troops had been reported to be leaving the area Unprofor in
Sarajevo confirmed that 'thousands' of Serb forces remained on the summit of
Mount Igman.

FT  13 AUG 93 / Leading Article: Failure pays
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE OF THE yardsticks against which top people's remuneration packages
should be judged is whether the directors feel the pinch when the company
underperforms. Yet a study this week from Incomes Data Services confirms
once again that the balance between risk and reward in the typical executive
contract is all too often weighed in favour of the director against the
company and its shareholders.
Not only do executives on the usual three-year rolling contracts leave with
an average of two years' pay in their pockets regardless of performance;
many also take away other perks, including cars and compensation for
expected bonus payments. Worse, the size of the pay-off often bears an
inverse relation to merit because companies base the settlement on a
calculation of what a law court might award, taking into account the
director's re-employment prospects. Thus, the more public and egregious the
person's failure, the lower the chances of a new job and the higher the
settlement.
Not all who leave have done anything wrong. Contracts are often broken
because the job has ceased to exist or the company has been taken over. But
even in these cases a two-year pay-off seems excessive, as most senior
executives get new jobs five months after losing their old one.
Supporters of three-year rolling contracts argue that legally enforceable
tenure encourages continuity in the boardroom and prevents managers from
taking short term decisions. But this does not square with the real world.
Directors of Marks &amp; Spencer, P &amp; O and Abbey National, to name but three
less than obvious short termists, do not have rolling contracts of more than
a year.
A second argument is that good managers are in short supply and will only
move if they are promised security. Yet it is hard to believe that the
really scarce managers are the ones who need this kind of security, let
alone the reassurance that they will be disproportionately rewarded if they
fail.
The best way to ensure commitment for the long term is to tie the overall
pay package to long-term performance. The simple answer to the contract
dilemma is to make one-year contracts the norm. Postel, which manages the
pension fund investments of British Telecom and the Post Office, has already
applied pressure to larger British companies on this score - and to good
effect. The terms on which the new chief executive of Booker was hired took
into account Postel's requirements. But the chain of accountability from
management to shareholder still has weak links. Better disclosure of
remuneration, severance and pension packages would help institutional
shareholders apply pressure where it is most needed.

FT  13 AUG 93 / Personal View: Mobilising the long-term jobless
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW GLYN and BOB ROWTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Recent proposals to meet the continuing prospect of 3m unemployed in the UK
have focused on the labour market and in particular on making the long-term
unemployed more attractive to employers via subsidies. The long-term
unemployed now make up almost 1.1m of the 2.91m jobless total announced
yesterday. Therefore they do bear a disproportionate part of the burden of
mass joblessness.
It is hard to believe, however, that the fundamental block on expansion of
the economy lies in the capacity for useful work of those now unemployed.
With a rapid expansion of demand, employment would rise rapidly just as it
did in the late 1980s; without it, improvements in the job market would be
meagre.
The prospects for an expansion of demand are much less favourable than a
decade ago. The legacy of a boom, based on an explosion of private sector
credit, is still being digested. The traditional Keynesian policy of fiscal
expansion appears to be ruled out by the size of the budget deficit. The
balance of payments is very precarious, with the overseas deficit projected
at 4 per cent of gross domestic product this year and next; with a marginal
propensity to import of 40 per cent, a fast enough expansion to provide work
for large numbers would lead to an unsustainable deterioration in the
current account.
A Europe-wide expansion would ease the payments problems of individual
countries, but seems a distant prospect. Supply-side policies to bolster the
traded-goods sector, as advocated by the Labour party, would at best be very
slow to take effect. Does the balance of payments constraint imply a ceiling
on the generation of jobs? Not necessarily. Expanding employment in the
public services and on infrastructural investment involves few additional
imports.
The removal of people from dole queues into work would increase their
purchasing power. If total consumption expanded, according to the classic
'multiplier', imports would increase rapidly.
To prevent this, the gains in purchasing power of those who find jobs must
be transferred from other consumers. This would be achieved by the
government expenditure being financed by increased taxation. Those presently
at work would suffer some cut in consumption, balanced by gains for those
currently unemployed. Thus there would be no increase in imports for
personal consumption.
If balance of payments weakness rules out expanding demand across the board,
then Keynes's 'How to pay for the war' - where he analysed how to restrain
consumption while employment was expanded in the munitions industries and
the armed forces - should be reconsidered. With import controls no longer a
credible option, and with the likelihood that trading partners would object
equally to further substantial real depreciations, the only feasible
approach is to target expansion on the least import intensive sectors -
public works and public services.
But isn't a rapid rise in employment, combined with tax increases to
restrain personal consumption, a recipe for faster inflation? Evading the
balance of payments constraint is of little help if another barrier,
inflation, is thereby critically breached.
The cost to the exchequer of unemployment (benefits paid and tax lost) means
that the net cost of expanding public service employment (in terms of higher
tax rates and thus reduced consumption of those already employed) is far
less than the gross cost. With strong support for improved public services,
holding back the growth of real consumption may not be seriously
inflationary.
The issue is whether popular support can be gained for a policy of
eliminating mass unemployment. The costs of doing so will have to be quite
broadly borne in terms of restraint on personal consumption, though the
benefits from improved public services extend far beyond those who find
jobs.
In the early 1940s, people were prepared to accept much more severe
restraint on their consumption in order to further the war effort; an
important lesson from that experience is that sacrifices must be seen to be
fairly distributed.
The fundamental point is that a significant expansion of public expenditure,
with progressive increases in taxation and savings on the dole providing the
finance, is a straightforward and predictable way of tackling mass
unemployment. Indeed, under present circumstances, it is probably the only
way.

So much for the idea that Swiss bankers are conservative sorts. The latest
letter to shareholders from Union Bank of Switzerland, flagship of the
country's banking community, is filled with superlatives which would make
any self-respecting public relations flack cringe.
Anyone can see that an 89 per cent jump in UBS's first-half net income is
jolly good without having to be reminded that 'UBS even managed to outshine
its dazzling performance in the fourth quarter of 1992'.
UBS's Gertrud Erismann admitted the language might be thought a bit over the
top, but 'we feel that the result is so positive that it would not be honest
not to be positive'.
But despite the 'outstanding financial results', UBS did have a few
problems. 'It is hard to understand,' says the letter from the board of
directors, 'how an employee of our Chiasso branch . . . could embezzle
roughly 1.3 tons of gold over an extended period of time.'
Easy, the bosses were too busy making record profits.

Calling all intrepid travellers who like to get close to the action. China's
state-run space industry, suffering from shrinking government subsidies, is
offering what could well be a unique opportunity to witness at close hand
its Long March rocket take-off from Sichuan province.
But Observer will not be first in the queue. Even at the European Space
Agency's launch site in French Guiana, privileged onlookers at last year's
launch had to stay at least 4km away during take-off in case the thing blew
up.
And that was nearer than safety regulations would allow at Cape Canaveral,

A romantic footnote has crept into the lengthy BCCI fraud trial now drawing
to a close in New York. As the jurors were being asked to decide whether the
Washington lawyer Robert Altman was honest or whether he helped BCCI to
cheat US bank regulators, there was an unexpected cry of objection, your
honour.
It had nothing to do with the four months of testimony or the hundreds of
boxes of documents. Much more down to earth. Altman's defence attorney felt
sure that one of the jurors, an attractive, single, thirtysomething from New
York's upper west side, had made eyes at the prosecutor, Manhattan district
attorney and Chevy Chase lookalike John Moscow.
Altman's lawyer complained that the juror had given Moscow 'long, lingering
looks' and 'mouthed hellos' during the five-month trial. Moscow, nicknamed
the 'Romeo DA' after he married a juror 12 years ago, disagreed strongly and
said that the juror was just being 'attentive'.
However, the judge had also noticed the juror's 'peculiar behaviour and
strange body language'. She was summarily dismissed.

Jim Slater, The Independent's share tipster, seems to have pulled off a
sleight of hand in his weekly column. To reassure readers, and get round
conflicts of interest, Slater agreed not to deal in shares which he writes
about for six weeks before and after publication.
In yesterday's column, however, he neatly reversed the burden of proof by
claiming that he could not reveal to readers which two tips they should cut
losses on, since he had recently bailed out himself.
Thus the rule now seems to be that Slater cannot advise people about shares
he has dealt in, rather than the other way round. Those who followed his
advice and bought his tips earlier this year were left scrabbling for hints
about the identity of the two companies.

A bizarre battle has broken out in Brazil over the proper handling of the
country's rapidly weakening currency. Brazil's central bank is threatening
to sue one of the country's top TV presenters for daring to make paper
aeroplanes out of banknotes on his popular Sunday afternoon show.
The threat comes after Silvio Santos ignored a written warning in February.
It appears that using cruzeiro notes to make paper aeroplanes constitutes a
contravention of the penal code which prohibits the wilful destruction or
damage of currency.
The central bank explains that the cost of replacing damaged notes is very
high and, in a new twist to economic theory, adds that making people aware
of the need to keep their money in good condition is vital if inflation is
to be reduced from its level of 1,900 per cent a year. So now we know why
the bank has just changed its currency for the fourth time since 1986 and is
reported to be burning 3m worthless notes a day.

FT  13 AUG 93 / Unwelcome gifts for the new team: The yen's surge is adding
to the Japanese government's economic problems
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A sure sign of the Japanese economy's poor health has been the unusual
reluctance of most leading companies to court their customers and
politicians with the traditional mid-year gift, an ornately wrapped melon, a
box of pale Japanese cherries or a quaint collection of different coffees
and milk substitutes.
Instead of the cherries, Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the new prime minister, was
presented this week with an economy sliding into the second phase of a
'double-dip' downturn, as well as an embarrassingly large trade surplus and
an irrepressible yen, which closed yesterday in Tokyo at a record Y103.37 to
the dollar.
Mr Hosokawa, who wants international intervention to calm the currency
markets, fears the yen's rapid appreciation will delay economic recovery by
putting extra pressure on companies already having a bad year. The yen surge
has also rekindled the mid-1980s debate over whether Japanese industry will
be 'hollowed out' by a shift of production capacity to cheaper locations
such as Malaysia and China.
The concerns about industrial decline are probably overdone, but Japanese
companies are facing their fourth consecutive year of falling profits and
are looking for new ways to cut costs. In the 1980s, the effects of a strong
yen were countered by frenetic asset price rises and profit growth of the
'bubble' years. In the early 1990s, companies are still sweating out
'bubble' era excesses and must cope with a currency close to the important
threshold of Y100 to the dollar.
Mr Hosokawa and his seven-party coalition government will need to address
the economy quickly. There are calls from industry to cut official interest
rates and reduce income taxes, and counter-arguments from the finance
ministry that slowing tax revenues have left the country unable to afford
another stimulatory spending package or tax relief.
A few months ago, in the spring, Japan's economic planners were confident
that the buds of recovery were emerging. One senior official even warned
that the economy was in danger of 'overheating'. New car sales rose in March
for the first time in 14 months, Tokyo stock prices had bounced higher, and
there were stirrings in the housing market.
But a fresh flow of unfavourable statistics suggests that the early optimism
was unwarranted. New car sales in July slipped 10.8 per cent from the same
month a year ago, marking four months of double-digit falls, the longest
decline since 1974. The ratio of job offers to applicants over the month of
June slipped from 81:100 to 74:100.
Jobs offered by manufacturing industry in June fell 26.3 per cent from a
year earlier.
The weakening of the job market has eroded consumer confidence. Cars aside,
sales at department stores in June were 8.9 per cent lower, the largest
year-on-year fall on record. It was a sign that consumers are spending more
in discount shops rather than in department stores, which tend to deal in
well-known brands and high-quality goods.
Bank of Japan officials say the two most worrisome economic trends are the
continuing fall in consumption and reductions in capital spending by
Japanese companies, some of which invested recklessly during the late 1980s,
when funds were raised at almost zero cost and high return on investment was
taken for granted.
One result of cheap money was speculative stock and property investments
which produced huge losses for companies and bankers, while manufacturers
were tempted into an unnecessary expansion of production capacity within
Japan. New machinery orders rose 24.4 per cent in 1988, but investment in
plant and equipment fell 5.7 per cent last year and Nomura Research
Institute expects a further 4.8 per cent contraction this year.
In a just released quarterly outlook, the Bank of Japan said manufacturers
are 'adjusting' to the environment of less rapid growth, and 'building up
the potential for future investment expansion'. But the bank also identified
one potential obstacle to this recovery, yen appreciation.
'The current stagnant investment in the assembly industry is a reflection of
low profitability in the industry, and the possibility that a further
appreciation of the yen could trigger a massive substitution of overseas
investment for domestic production cannot be ruled out,' the bank warned.
The assessment was made before the yen resumed its rise this month. Closing
last year at Y124.65 to the dollar, the yen rose sharply in January and then
calmed in March. It has appreciated 17 per cent so far this year, in spite
of intervention by the Bank of Japan and the government's plea that the
movements 'do not reflect the economy's fundamentals'.
There are various theories for the yen's strength. Currency traders say the
trade surplus, which rose 28 per cent in July, is an important cause, and
repatriation of foreign funds by Japanese institutions is said to be a
trigger for speculative movements. According to Mr Yoji Inaba, economic
research director at the Japan Development Bank, yen appreciation was
generally expected, but 'not this quickly'.
'The pace of appreciation is too fast, and there will be serious costs for
the Japanese economy,' Mr Inaba said. 'We can see 'hollowing out' in the
electric machinery and audio-visual equipment industries. Many companies
already have factories in east Asia and can increase capacity there. The big
impact will be on employment on Japan.'
His assessment suggests the yen's current movements are undermining consumer
confidence and job security, and raise the medium-term possibility of
lay-offs on a scale not seen since the second world war. As Mr Inaba put it:
'Another year of falling profits and companies will have to start getting
rid of excess workers in middle management.'
Companies are already shifting production to east Asia, but hoping to keep
the highest value-added products at home. Canon is increasing camera
production in China, Yuasa is doubling its production of car batteries in
Thailand over the next two years, and Ricoh this week announced a new
facsimile machine venture in Shanghai.
These and other manufacturers, their workforces, and the Japanese economy
would be under greater pressure if it were not for rapid growth in China and
elsewhere in east Asia. Japanese video camera exports to China quadrupled in
the first half of this year, passenger car exports were eight times larger,
and steel exports doubled, while total exports rose 51.2 per cent.
Attempts to cool the Chinese economy could, however, slow Japanese export
growth later this year, while exports to other countries will be hurt by the
higher price tags that accompany yen appreci-ation.
Mr Masaru Yoshitomi, vice-chairman of the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan
Research Institute, estimates that a 15 per cent appreciation could lead to
a 5 per cent fall in exports and a 0.5 per cent decline in economic growth,
generally expected to be 1.5 per cent in the year to March.
'If you have strong growth, then a 0.5 per cent decline does not matter so
much, but when you already have a sluggish economy, the impact is not
negligible,' said Mr Yoshitomi, who retired from the government's Economic
Planning Agency last year.
The agency is been remarkably optimistic in the face of economic downturn
and yen appreciation, as the new prime minister has discovered. Japan's
official target for growth, produced by the agency, is 3.3 per cent which,
it argues, is 'still valid' on the grounds that 'if the target is higher,
the effort will be greater'.
Mr Hosokawa needs to gather fresh opinions. If he believes the official
advice, the economy is set to recover later this year and will require no
initiatives such as income tax cuts or an interest rate reduction or a fresh
spending package to stimulate growth.
However, Japanese companies do not seem to agree: they have not abandoned
their gift-giving traditions without good economic cause.

BACK IN March, when the west was in one of its periodic funks about Russia,
the European Commission extended a gesture of support for President Boris
Yeltsin: an offer to negotiate an eventual free trade zone with his country.
It was a generous acknowledgement of the overriding importance of exports to
Russian economic reform. Last Saturday, the Commission sent out a
contradictory signal by discreetly announcing a strict limit on imports of
aluminium from the Commonwealth of Independent States until November.
Is the EC - as a furious Russian government and industry allege - now
showing the true meaning of its free trade promises? Does Saturday's
announcement signify, as did previous moves against eastern European steel
and agricultural goods, that Brussels is prepared to open up its markets to
all products apart from those in which the countries to the east have a real
comparative advantage? The answer in this case, at least for now, is: not
necessarily. The Commission insists that it had to act against a sudden and
highly disruptive surge of heavily subsidised aluminium exports from the
CIS. The import restriction, it says, constitutes a temporary measure,
designed to secure for Europe's aluminium industry a 'breathing space' in
which negotiations can take place with the governments concerned.
That low-cost CIS exports - produced with ludicrously cheap energy and
highly subsidised credit - are disrupting the west European market is not in
doubt. Between 1989 and 1992, as the aluminium-using industries of Russia
and the other republics collapsed, imports jumped from virtually nothing to
an estimated 9 per cent of EC consumption. This year, as the quantity has
grown further, prices have tumbled, stocks have soared and Community
producers have cried out for assistance.
Because Russia has yet to be admitted to Gatt, its trading partners have no
ground rules under which to seek redress. But were Russia a member, the EC
might well have a case. Indeed, the Commission says it has been trying to
achieve an accord establishing transparent pricing and orderly marketing -
as well as providing for EC assistance towards modernisation of CIS
aluminium smelters. Such is the chaos in Moscow, however, that it has not
even been able to obtain precise statistics on the volume of aluminium now
leaving the former Soviet Union.
Nevertheless, it is questionable whether this week's move represents the
most effective way of securing such an agreement. In the first place, it
seems to have angered other aluminium producers almost as much as those in
the CIS itself. The US industry, in particular, fears that the flood of
cheap metal will simply be diverted from western Europe in its direction.
What is needed is multilateral co-operation, not unilateral enforcement.
Second, there is a danger that short-term sanctions could turn into
longer-term protection for an industry that still needs to cut costs in
western Europe and America.
Western governments and industries are bound to be unsettled by Russia's
transition to a market economy. But in such an economy, Russia will almost
certainly have an advantage in aluminium production. Rather than seeking to
insulate the EC from the side-effects, the Commission should make speeding
that transition its highest priority.

FT  13 AUG 93 / Leading Article: Fishing rights
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN, in common with many nations, has too many fishermen chasing too few
fish. Measures to curb overfishing are unavoidable, otherwise the sea will
be progressively robbed of its wealth and the industry will lurch from
crisis to crisis. This much is accepted by government and industry alike.
But all schemes to curb overfishing are not equally good, as today's House
of Commons agriculture committee's report makes clear. The committee urges
the government to abandon a plan, which has already been suspended following
a campaign by fishermen, to require trawlers to be tied up in port for half
the year or more. Instead, a twin-track approach should be adopted, whereby
fishermen would be bought out of the industry and fishing rights then sold
to those who remained.
This proposal has much to commend it. Although the government already has a
Pounds 25m scheme to buy fishermen out and decommission their boats, the
committee criticises it as half-hearted. A more generous approach would mean
there was no need for fishermen to remain idle for half the year, while
insurance and other fixed costs of maintaining boats mounted. Those bought
out of the industry could seek productive employment elsewhere.
The main drawback of paying fishermen to sell their boats is, of course,
money. But this is where the committee's second proposal of selling
fishermen individual transferable quotas (ITQs), specifying the amount of
fish they were allowed to catch, could come in. The cash raised could pay
for decommissioning costs.
While fishermen would balk at having to pay for fishing rights which they
previously received free, the pill would be sweetened if coated with a
generous decommissioning scheme. It might also be less unpalatable than the
government's tie-up plans.
Introducing ITQs would have other benefits too. Because fishing rights could
be traded, fishermen who needed bigger quotas would be able to buy them from
those with spare capacity. Such a system, already successfully implemented
in Australia and New Zealand, could also curb overfishing and boost incomes
of those who remained in the industry.
Critics of ITQs say they could not be introduced in the UK alone because of
the European Community's common fisheries policy. But this ignores the fact
that once the Community's annual fishing catch is divided between nations,
each country is free to distribute quotas to its fishermen however it
chooses. While it would be desirable if other European Community countries
embraced ITQs as well, that is no reason for Britain holding back. Mrs
Gillian Shephard, the agriculture secretary, should take note.

FT  13 AUG 93 / Paradise lost in the west: Two of a kind - How bishops are
responding to the divisions within their countries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Joachim Meisner of Cologne, dispatched to the Rhine by God and the pope, has
taken on an exacting task: to plough a furrow of catholic rigour straight
and narrow across Germany's churned-up soil.
A former citizen of East Germany, a long-time protege of Pope John Paul, and
a cardinal in Rome since 1983, he scans the Germans and their weaknesses
with hawkish eastern eyes.
In residence in west Germany for 4 1/2 years, the archbishop ostensibly
bridges the gap between the two parts of the reunited nation. Yet he also
shows how large and uneasy the divide still is.
Clashes of theology and personality were inevitable from the day this
conservative Prussian cardinal arrived in Cologne, a bastion of west German
liberal catholicism. But the ferment generated by his onslaughts on
Germany's spiritual shortcomings has surpassed all expectations.
On a chill morning in his office near the cathedral, the archbishop
illustrates why he provokes passion. He speaks in fiery parables, lacerating
his enemies in a voice rising and falling with the cadence of psalms.
The archbishop says members of the ruling Christian Democrat party who
support liberalisation of west German abortion laws 'betray' Christian
principles. His doctrinaire views on this, along with issues such as
remarriage of divorcees or the religious status of women, have exposed him
to strong criticism, and prompted thousands of Rhineland catholics to quit
the Church.
However, such reactions to his moral offensive strengthen his conviction
that he is right. 'It is better that the Church becomes smaller and remains
faithful, than if it seeks popularity through false adjustment to society.
The Church is in the world, but not of it.'
The bishopric of Cologne - the largest in Germany, with an extensive welfare
network of homes, schools and hospitals - has a temporal as well as a
spiritual role. As a young man in East Germany, the archbishop was once an
apprentice bank clerk.
Could he have become not bishop but banker? Softly, he points out that he
sits on two Vatican finance committees. 'It is not unimportant that I know
something about finance. God moves in mysterious ways.'
There is nothing mysterious about the archbishop's relish for strife. Born
on Christmas Day 1933 in Silesia (now Poland), he fled in 1945 with his
family from the Soviet advance and settled in what became communist East
Germany. After taking religious orders, during the 1980s he became the head
of the East German catholic Church, a tiny hotbed of defiance to the
communist regime.
Commanded by the pope - whom he has known since 1975 - to take his
ecclesiastical orthodoxy westwards, the cardinal moved from Berlin to the
Rhine in 1988, a year before the fall of the Berlin Wall. The collapse of
communism took him, like so many, by surprise. He thought he would never
live to see German reunification; the pope, he says, saw it coming. 'He told
me in 1987: 'The tide is turning.' I said: 'Holy Father: I don't believe
you.' '
For the reunification celebrations in October 1990, a triumphant fragment of
Berlin Wall graced the Cologne cathedral altar. Nearly three years later,
the joy has disappeared. 'I am shocked and shaken at how quickly the gift of
freedom and the gift of human rights seem to have faded into the background
as the economic situation has deteriorated.'
The west Germans' reluctance to make sacrifices for the east is one more
sign of human frailty, he says. 'Man's overall spiritual condition is the
situation of original sin. How does a human being come to the world? A child
is not born with outstretched hands, to give, but with clenched fists.'
Overall selfishness in united Germany has been exacerbated by a sorry
combination of materialism in the west and the residues of Marxist-Leninism
is the east.
'A people composed of pure egoists; a people who have been deluded into
thinking, in both east and west, that everything they want, they shall have:
how can such a people, from one day to another, learn how to share?'
To illustrate the lack of brotherly love, the archbishop relates a wry
Rhineland joke. ' 'Why do the Chinese smile? Because they still have the
Wall.' It is dreadful, dreadful. We should be saying: 'Why are we Germans
smiling? Because we no longer have the Wall.' '
The disappointments of reunification have been aggravated by false
perceptions in both parts of Germany, he says. 'The politicians completedly
underestimated the situation.'
East Germans, too, were unprepared for the difficulties of adjustment
because they expected 'paradise' from the west. 'As a person from the east I
really believed that, when we had got rid of communism, all our problems
would be over.
'We East German citizens knew West Germany solely from television. We
thought what we saw in the advertisements was the normal lifestyle of
ordinary West Germans.' When he went to West Berlin in 1980 for the first
time to visit priests, he says, 'I was surprised at the modesty of their
lives. It did not tally with what I had seen in TV advertisements.'
As to the future, the archbishop says Germany must no longer measure its
success 'by the size of wage packets', but must pool its 'spiritual
potential'. His eyes glint. 'I sit here before you as a man of the gospel,
and I will deliver what I have into the hand of the Lord.'
How many will rally to his crusade? The archbishop's gaze is fixed beyond
earthly things. This is a man for whom the stringent pursuit of virtue
offers, on high, its own reward.

</HEADLINE>

   From Mr MIKE SOLOSY

<TEXT>
Sir, In Antony Thorncroft's article, 'Behind the Queen's curtains' (August
8), he states that Queen Victoria's father was the Duke of York. I can only
assume that the splendour of his surroundings at Buckingham Palace
temporarily distracted him since her father was, in fact, the Duke of Kent.
At the time of her birth, I believe the Duke of York was a character by the
name of Frederick and was the Duke of Kent's brother. As for Thorncroft's
epithet of rogue, I guess that is a matter for personal interpretation,
although one wonders whether he was referring to the Duke of Kent or the
Duke of York.

FT  13 AUG 93 / Letter: An effective way to relieve fuel VAT burden
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr STEWART COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, There seems to be a kind of death wish in the way in which the
government has handled the issue of VAT on domestic fuel.
The Treasury and the Bank of England have both made the case for the
unpalatable necessity for increasing taxes; and the most effective way to
raise the substantial sums involved must of necessity be by extending the
scope of VAT.
The extension of VAT to domestic fuel is one of the more palatable options.
The need with this option must be to protect those on low incomes. The
method chosen of promising adjustments in benefits paid to compensate for
the imposition of VAT on domestic fuel has had all the predictable reactions
and has been shown to be politically inept.
A simple but effective way to overcome the problem would be to institute a
de minimus rule for all fuel bills so that if the total quarterly bill were
below a figure of, say, Pounds 50 no VAT would be charged and, if above,
full VAT would be chargeable.
In effect, the relief is at the point of sale and as such is the most
effective and cheap way of providing relief.

FT  13 AUG 93 / Letter: Where VW was badly advised in GM affair
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr VIC HEYLEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, If the manner in which Messrs Piech and Lopez have been conducting
business so far is in any way representative of the way they intend to run
the company, the future of Volkswagen looks very bleak indeed.
In their handling of the Der Spiegel affair they simply broke the most
elementary rules of corporate public relations behaviour.
First, they disregarded the basic rule, especially in the automotive
industry, never to react in this way to articles in the press. Then they
topped it off by asking the courts to order rebuttals to be printed and,
even worse, pressed for a gag order.
Mr Piech almost unbelievably failed to foresee Der Spiegel's very
predictable reaction. It asked and obtained from the court a suspension of
the ban and, by doing so, allowed the magazine to present sufficient
evidence to prove the substance of their allegations before the courts.
For Opel it was an unexpected opportunity that allowed it to submit its case
practically on its own terms. It eagerly offered Der Spiegel the assistance
of 22 GM and Opel witnesses and four legal experts. All volunteers, as they
claim.
Although Der Spiegel has a solid reputation for investigative reporting, it
is difficult to believe that it did not get any help from Opel when
researching the story.
It therefore looks very much as if Piech, with both eyes wide open, fell
into a trap set by Opel. 'I was badly advised,' Piech later ruefully
remarked.
An example of very poor managerial judgment from a man who claims to be the
only one qualified to save the embattled company. And with the help of a man
who increasingly seems to be responsible for this 'fine mess he got
Volkswagen in to'.

FT  13 AUG 93 / Letter: No special pay deal for top civil servants
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Ms ELIZABETH SYMONS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your piece on top civil service pay seems to have left some with the
idea that the senior civil service is being treated differently from other
public sector workers ('Performance pay deal could give top civil servants
3.5 per cent', August 10).
The fact is that the government pay policy has been applied rigorously to
all civil servants, irrespective of grade. As far as the senior civil
service is concerned, an addition of 1.25 per cent has been added to the pay
bill as a result of this year's negotiations. Unlike their colleagues
elsewhere in the civil services, senior civil servants no longer have
automatic increments, and thus, in order for the pay bill to stay cost
neutral in any one year, 2 per cent is available for performance-related
pay.
These arrangements have been strongly resisted in many parts of the public
sector, but of course as a result of their use some civil servants will be
paid no increase this year; all will be paid increases commensurate with
what their managers judge to be their contribution to the performance of
their department or agency.
The implication that somehow the senior civil service has got off lightly is
both misleading and unfair. There will be no automatic increase this year
for any civil servant covered by the recently negotiated package. Elizabeth

FT  13 AUG 93 / Letter: M&amp;S and a question of marketing strategy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr A M IRVANI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The defence by Marks and Spencer chairman Sir Richard Greenbury
(Letters, August 5), of its plans for Brooks Brothers (in response to Nikki
Tait' s article: Management, July 8) is to be expected. Nevertheless there
are aspects of his letter which surprise me.
'We are not trying to popularise Brooks,' he says. 'Clearly this would not
be in its interests and we are not so stupid as to think it would be.' The
last part of this comment, I fear, identifies the problem all too crisply.
'Brooks Brothers, however,' continues Sir Richard, 'cannot develop and grow
based upon a declining number of ageing Wall Street customers and must
broaden its base at least into the 40-year-olds . . .' Perhaps Sir Richard
is planning a massive expansion. Given the size of Brooks Brothers and the
large market available for its products, demographic factors should not
impede sustainable growth, '. . . while of course maintaining the loyalty of
its more traditional customers,' continues Sir Richard. 'We are succeeding
with this policy.' This confident assessment of success seems, to put it
mildly, rather premature.
More generally, Sir Richard's letter opens an interesting debate about
marketing strategy. Should companies that market products to a well-defined
group of customers and enjoy their loyalty continue to maintain the
integrity of their position, or should they be receptive to change?
Conventional wisdom is that companies must be sensitive to the markets they
serve and should attempt to optimise the preferences of their target
customers as successfully as possible. The recently fashionable view is that
firms should lead their customers rather than follow.
The long-term consequences of Sir Richard's decisions are not yet clear.
What is beyond doubt, however, is that I have lost a cherished supplier of
high-quality products.

FT  13 AUG 93 / Nation in need of team spirit: Two of a kind - How bishops
are responding to the divisions within their countries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
David Sheppard, bishop of Liverpool, is an admonitory priest, but not a
dismal one. He has the churchman's ability to see light amid the darkness.
Displaying the steadiness with which he played cricket for England between
1950 and 1963, the bishop has warned Conservative governments for more than
a decade about the depredations of unemployment.
The Church of England's standard-bearer in the city since 1975, he declared
in a celebrated BBC lecture in 1984 that poverty and unemployment were
causing 'sick human relationships' and 'a deeply divided nation'.
Now, as he analyses the latest long UK recession, the bishop spots a small,
perverse chink of optimism.
People living in middle-class, non-manufacturing areas of Britain, who were
mostly insulated from the previous downturn in the early 1980s, this time
round have borne their share of joblessness. So, although no one (including
the bishop) has a miracle solution for unemployment, at least nearly
everyone now knows what it is like.
'In a curious sense this recession has something more hopeful about it, in
that it is affecting a wider circle of people. This time, I think there's a
better chance that the nation might accept that unemployment is a real
problem. Before, I thought the nation was sweeping the problem away.'
In the drawing room of his airy Victorian residence, he illustrates the
point with a tale from a relatively prosperous district in his diocese.
'Someone told me the other day of a well-educated young man from that parish
who's just written off for his 300th job.'
He is a grey-haired 64, but there is still a hint of batsman's muscle
rippling beneath his purple bishop's shirt. He confesses that, at his
bedside (presumably next to another Good Book), he keeps a copy of the
Wisden cricket almanac.
If he were prime minister, how would the bishop of Liverpool bring down
unemployment? 'Sharing work round', he says, would be high on the agenda.
'We are going enormously in the opposite direction. We're getting a pattern
where there's a small core staff, working enormously hard with very high
salaries. Around them, there's a broad group of people moving jobs
constantly, often in part-time jobs. And, around them, there are people
outside the work structure altogether.
'In quite a lot of big outer estates in Merseyside we're into the second or
third generation of mass unemployment. From a Christian perspective, what is
apparent is the sheer waste of human gifts, and destructiveness of human
dignity.'
There is a 'blindingly obvious connection' between unemployment and crime.
Young people need role models: 'If they don't see men, younger or older
ones, having creative things to do, you've taken away the greatest weapon
for stopping boredom and destructive behaviour.'
After 18 years on Merseyside, the bishop sees the world through Liverpudlian
eyes. As a result of long-term economic stagnation, he points out how
Liverpool's black community has far more difficulty than in London in
breaking down jobs barriers. 'The year I came here, they picketed the stores
in the centre of Liverpool, saying black people don't get jobs here. Nothing
has changed too much.
'A group of young people from here went to London for the weekend and came
back eyes shining, saying: 'Black people drive buses in London.' I've not
yet seen a black bus driver here.'
There is a diffident note to his conversation. Perhaps his lack of
directness is partly because bishops know that, if they want to have any
influence at all in notoriously secular Britain, they cannot simply bang on
the table and talk about God but have to employ the more diffuse language of
market economics.
Has the Church been too hesitant in speaking out about the battle between
good and evil? 'I do think there is a struggle and always has been. I think
the Church sometimes has been a little diffident. I don't want to produce a
crude statement. Nevertheless I do believe there are forces of evil.' He
points to the former Yugoslavia. 'It's frightening how a group can lead
people into destructive attitudes where an individual might not.'
Three years ago, many people thought Bishop Sheppard's brand of gentlemanly
populism would make him the ideal candidate to take over as archbishop of
Canterbury on the retirement of Robert Runcie. Why didn't he get the job?
Slightly embarrassed, he replies: 'There was a lot of talk about it. My wife
and I said: 'Come on, we'd better stop and think what we would do.' Having
taken a proper look, I thought: 'If that comes my way, yes, I can see the
challenge and excitement as well as the rough stuff.' ' However, when Bishop
George Carey was chosen, he says, 'I felt an overriding sense of relief'.
The debate about the Lambeth Palace succession came at around the same time
as a new incumbent moved to 10 Downing Street. He is pleased that John Major
has abandoned some of the more simplistic nostrums of his predecessor.
'The aggressive confidence that wealth creation is all and, if only we can
produce that, it will trickle down through society, and the market will
decide: the doctrinaire view of that has softened very greatly, although it
hasn't all gone. I don't deny the strength of market forces, and I'm
absolutely clear you can't ignore them. But we need to build in other
forces, of a social market if you like, with other priorities.'
How these priorities should be reordered is not within the bishop's gift to
determine. He can put his finger on society's ills. Healing them is a matter
for the wider world beyond his pulpit.

FT  13 AUG 93 / Arts: Stravinsky and Szymanowski - Promenade concerts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This 99th Proms season at the Albert Hall may display a more
budget-conscious style of design than we have witnessed in recent years
(with, for instance, fewer top-class foreign orchestras and 'name' soloists
in the schedule). All the same, plenty of choice things have been collated
in it - programmes put together with imagination and flair, devised to
profit equally from the BBC's amplitude of resources and the Albert Hall's
vastness of size.
Two successive concerts earlier in the week made the point in a way to
inspire both gratitude and the special pleasure that only a 'characteristic'
Proms concert can provide. Both employed large choirs - which, in these
penny-pinched days, is fast becoming a sign of wild profligacy - alongside
large orchestras to create the sort of musical canvas ideally exhibited in
this particular auditorium.
Stravinsky's Persephone, given on Wednesday by the BBC Singers, Symphony
Orchestra and Chorus, and the (excellent) New London Children's Choir under
David Atherton, almost always affords a wonderful Proms experience: a work
full of potential awkwardnesses in other contexts which in this one radiates
an unstrained serenity and wholeness.
The 1934 melodrame for speaker-dancer, tenor, choruses and orchestra is a
hybrid about which in later years the composer himself came to express
strong reservations - not just over the quality of Andre Gide's verse (which
he variously described as 'eau distille' or 'vers de caramel') but over the
basic feasibility of marrying spoken and musical material to each other at
all, let alone to dance. (In this performance, because of the monochrome,
shallow-toned delivery - uncomfortably amplified - of the speaker, Laurence
Bouvard, the sense of Stravinsky's reservation was underlined rather more
forcefully than it need be.)
In the concert hall we lose any embodiment of the physical, graphic quality
that was Stravinsky's peculiar musical gift. What we gain - or at least we
do in a performance as authoritative, fluent and concentrated as Atherton's
 -is an indelible impression of the score's unique beauty. This may be most
French-accented of Stravinsky's neo-Classical masterpieces, with textures
and phrases of a Gounod-esque limpidity and sweetness, with outpouring of
arias and choral setpieces unlike anything else in the composer's oeuvre;
but, spread across the Albert Hall spaces, and sustained upon distinct
blending of timbres and precise rhythmic currents, its ceremonial aspects
develop an almost Russian Orthodox ritualised grandeur - which shows
Persephone to be at once a detour and a milestone on Stravinsky's epic
journey.
The previous evening, it had been the turn of the Philharmonia Orchestra and
Chorus, conducted by Claus Peter Flor, to make their single appearance at
the Proms, and - with Jadwiga Gadulanka as soprano soloist - to come
together for a rapturous account of Szymanowski's Third Symphony, 'Song of
the Night' as concert-closer. The setting (in Polish translation) of poems
by the 13th century Persian mystic Rumi is one of the intoxicating creations
of 20th-century music - shimmering, swooning, sensuous in all its
combinations - and it was here floated across to the audience in tones of
ravishing lustre. Even this audience-member, who normally finds that a
little of these particular ecstasies goes a long way, was kept spellbound.

Prague Festival Ballet is a small group of classically trained dancers -
they are members of companies at the Vienna Volksoper, in Brno and Prague -
who unite for occasional performances under their rather grandiose title.
The troupe's very existence serves as some indication of the quest in
Eastern Europe for free (and free-enterprise) artistic ventures. They look,
inevitably, to the West for examples.
What shackled creativity in the unhappy past was clogged socialist realism -
Soviet-style - or, rather curiously, ill-digested Bejart. The percolation of
any fresher dance ideas has been slow, and hampered by few opportunities to
see and absorb innovative Western work. So the concept of 'modern' ballet is
often a matter of emotion rather than step: the choreographic adventures we
accept as inevitable are largely unknown. Angst rather than abstraction is
the norm, and an out-of-date vocabulary is burdened with themes and messages
it cannot sustain in movement.
This Prague troupe - returning to London after a brief visit last year  - is
eager with good intentions, but sadly limited in ways of expressing them. Of
three pieces on view on Wednesday, one, Silent Whispers, was devoted to
folk-song and dance, and was quaint to a point far out of sight. Some of its
Moravian folk-tunes were fascinating; the dance, by David Slobaspyckyj was
not. The two other offerings - Mr Slobaspyckyj's Love Lessons and Alice
Necsea's Serenade - were lethargic. Palm Court music for the first
(including the tango Jealousy) received Palm Court dancing, ineffably
winsome and distinctly un-challenging. Miss Necsea's view of a serenade by
the distinguished Slovak composer Eugen Suchon was no less relaxed in its
demands: the dancers behaved as if it were impolite to sweat in public.
Plotless dance of this kind - which invokes in programme notes the name of
Balanchine - should take heed of Mr B's question to a sluggish dancer in
class: 'What are you saving yourself for?' The motto and, I believe, the
duty for Western ballet is 'Go East', to help dance there find a way into
the latter half of our century.

Given that the Friday night schedules are currently chock-a-block with
rubbish and repeats it looks as though ITV's Survival Special will have a
clear run at the ratings. This is an hour-long account of Prince Charles'
'nature friendly' methods of gardening and farming at Highgrove, filmed over
two years by wildlife expert Maurice Tibbles. The prince, who began his
organic regime with 85 acres in 1985, has now brought the whole 1,112 acre
estate under his non-chemical scheme (9.00 ITV).
There are two Proms both relayed live from the Albert Hall on Radio 3. At
7.00 composer Peter Maxwell Davies conducts the BBC Philharmonic in
Mendelssohn's 'Hebrides' overture and Beethoven's 4th piano concerto
(soloist Barry Douglas) and, at 8.10, his own Symphony No 2. Then, in a
concert at 10.00, Jane Glover conducts Hungarian pianists Peter Frankl and
Tamas Vasary and the BBC Singers in the original version of Brahms'
'Liebslieder' waltzes.
Radio 4 begins a new series which promises to 'demystify the arcane workings
of the medical profession': Struck Off And Die (11.00).

FT  13 AUG 93 / Arts: Driven through palaces - Patricia Morison makes a plea
for more time to stand and stare
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICIA MORISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
You love looking at great paintings. Should you then go to Buckingham Palace
to see the Queen's pictures? Other things being equal, of course you should
because the Picture Gallery is just wonderful. However, the decision whether
or not to 'do' Buckingham Palace must depend on the time available and sheer
physical stamina. How physically uncomfortable can one be and still derive
pleasure from art?
It could so easily be different, not just at Buckingham Palace but at
cultural monuments everywhere, if only cultural tourism was not focused on
the mass-experience. Although Buckingham Palace is mercifully not quite as
popular as some had projected, there were still 6,000 visitors last
Wednesday, which is a lot for a building not purpose-built as a museum.
You should expect to queue for between 60 and 90 minutes for your ticket; it
is possible to have the whole thing over in a morning if you are near the
front of the queue by around 8am. Luring you on is the thought of the
Picture Gallery where this year there are some dozen splendid masterpieces;
Guercino's 'Libyan Sibyl', Guido Reni's sensual 'Cleopatra', the utterly
chaste Agatha Bas as portrayed by Rembrandt, Rubens's 'Farm at Laeken' and
'St George and the Dragon', together with works by de Hooch, Cuyp, and
Claude Lorrain.
Other rooms have memorable paintings and some surprises, such as finding no
less than three women artists: the Renaissance wonder Sophonisba da
Anguissola; Angelica Kaufmann (her large German duchess has the Throne Room
to herself); and a marble statue of Princess Louise made in 1877 by obscure
Mary Thornycroft.
However, the Picture Gallery is the thing, perhaps above all for the chance
to see together two of the most famous and haunting images of royalty ever
made, Van Dyck's 'Great Piece', Charles I with Henrietta Maria and the two
eldest children, faces the great equestrian portrait of Charles and his
riding master, M. de St Antoine. (The second, larger portrait of the king on
a dun charger is in the National Gallery.)
These monumental paintings would be better seen from much further away, as
the artist intended and as they were at one time displayed in the Van Dyck
Room at Windsor Castle. Even so, it is marvellous to compare these two very
different images of a doomed king. Royalists will find them the more
poignant for being still within palace walls and just a stroll away from the
Banqueting House where Charles's head was struck from his shoulders.
So far, so very good, but the drawback is that visitors have to move in one
direction only. Anyone who wants to look properly must be for ever
criss-crossing the gallery which is a wretched way to see paintings. They
will permit no looping back for a last look, a particular hardship in the
case of Rembrandt's small 'Christ and Mary Magdalene at the Tomb', to my
mind one of the loveliest things he ever did.
On a pragmatic view, the Queen's generosity in lending works from her vast
collection - for example, to The Queen's Pictures at the National Gallery
last year - lessens the urgency of going to the Palace. Both my favourite
Rembrandt and 'Agatha Bas' were widely seen in the 1991 Rembrandt show. The
third terrific Rembrandt, 'The Shipbuilder and his Wife', was shown at
around the same period in the Queen's Gallery beside Buckingham Palace.
For 30 years, the Queen's Gallery has been making the royal collections
accessible, although as a rule its shows are very little publicised. It is
there that you will find Vermeer's 'Lady at the Virginals' in an exhibition
on George III and Consul Smith previously noticed on this page.
Even so, I hope that the Buckingham Palace visit will also become a regular
feature of London's cultural resources, as the summer visit to the Palais du
Roi is in Brussels. (Will public opinion prise open the Prince of
Liechtenstein's collection at Vaduz Castle?) I would also like to see
special access for people who are not interested to flow by, gazing
open-mouthed at the mirrors and chandeliers, but want instead to concentrate
on the art treasures.
Some country houses with important art collections do offer 'connoisseurs'
trips', although not nearly enough. They do at Boughton House in
Northamptonshire, a palatial building of exceptional beauty which is only
open on August afternoons. The intact 17th-century panelled State Rooms with
their tapestries are protected by being shown as part of the longer tour.
I see the royal palaces as a classic example of the need to offer the public
a split-level, sheep-and-goats kind of cultural tourism. Separating the
serious from the faintly curious visitor preserves the quality of the
experience and should become part of the strategy for protecting prime
cultural destinations while actually increasing public access and awareness.
Unfortunately, the sole object of the people who run many tourist venues is
to herd visitors round in droves, adding on so-called 'attractions' which in
reality amount to force-feeding us gimmicky, patronising, low-grade pap.
How great an improvement it would be if, instead, every great castle,
palace, or great house offered a choice of experience. Whether at
Versailles, Wilton House or Castle Howard, there ought to be a 'happy hour'.
Enthusiasts, who may have hankered to see a place for years, could be
assured of the peace to look, savour, and commit the experience to memory.
Of course, the motive for opening Buckingham Palace is financial and not
philanthropic. It might reduce the takings to lay on something special for
people with a serious interest, even though they would be asked to pay
sweetly for the privilege. (I see no reason why a private view of a great
art collection should not cost as much as a good seat at the opera.)
However, there is also the matter of popularity. It is surely no bad
investment if in future years a trip to the palace could be made more
appealing to the Queen's more educated subjects.

FT  13 AUG 93 / Arts: The Tempest - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The RSC's new production at Stratford-upon-Avon, The Tempest, ends with a
raspberry. Alec McCowen's Prospero is finally granting freedom to the spirit
Ariel. 'Fare thou well,' he says in tones that include gratitude and
affection. We think that only the epilogue is to come. Then Simon Russell
Beale's Ariel responds to the farewell by spitting copiously on Prospero's
face before marching off.
What this incident has to do with the rest of the production is exceedingly
unclear. Until the raspberry director Sam Mendes has delivered an
interpretation that is almost entirely cerebral. This is a Tempest that
smacks excessively of English literary criticism. All the studies of what
Shakespeare might have meant by the difference between nature, as
represented by Caliban, and nurture, as it is portrayed by Prospero, have
been read and digested. It is one of the most hierarchically structured
productions of the play that you are likely to see.
David Troughton's Caliban is not a beast in the literal sense. His physical
form is entirely human, but he is a being of little brain. He looks and
moves like a not very good, retarded Japanese wrestler. Prospero personifies
learning and the belated coming of wisdom and even forgiveness. Frequently
he appears at the top of one of those very tall pairs of library steps.
The rest of the characters are somewhere in the middle. The real villains in
the Mendes view are Stephano and Trinculo, normally described as a drunken
butler and a jester. Here Stephano is shown as a pseudo-toff with a
see-through upper-class accent. Trinculo carries a ventriloquist's dummy.
The performances, by Mark Lockyer as Stephano especially, are very fine, but
it seems unfair to blame them for all the ills that flesh can get up to.
There are, after all, plenty of genuine villains around, such as the lot who
deposed Prospero as the Duke of Milan in the first place.
The latter do not get much of a look in. Ariel does, and it was a striking
decision to cast a man who admits he looks as if he was born to play Caliban
in this role. Russell Beale is very good; he always is. He is dressed in one
of those Chinese tunics that suggests he belongs to the party machine. He
struts about like an obedient, if reluctant military servant, but one does
wonder if that final venomous spitting is not a hint that he would have been
happier playing the beast.
The trouble with trying to impose a hierarchical, ordered vision on The
Tempest is that ultimately it does not work. The play is full of mysteries,
just as the isle is full of noises, but they are not noises that can be
easily explained. There ought to be a lot of fun in it, but unless you count
the rather cruel humour of the Trinculo-Stephano-Caliban scene, there is no
fun here, not even the element of surprise. There is not much romance
either. Ferdinand, played by Mark Lewis Jones, is a plodding, if amiable
dolt, and there is no sign that Sarah Woodward's Miranda has benefited from
all those years of learned tutorials with her father. When she sees a
collection of real people at the end and comments 'How beauteous mankind
is', she sounds as if she is setting off to be a coquette.
Still, you should not let such criticisms deter you from going. Until the
final scene, I found the direction riveting throughout. There is also the
perverse pleasure of being irritated at the same time.

FT  13 AUG 93 / Arts: U2 at Wembley - Pop concert
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
With pop music so obviously suffering a crisis of confidence it is
comforting to find a band wholly committed to spectacle, drama, megalomania
and pretension. Half way through his performance at Wembley Arena on
Wednesday, Bono, the singer and driving force behind that principal prop of
the Irish economy, U2, took time off to sort out Bosnia. His live screen
link up with some cowed looking inhabitants of Sarajevo got prospects for
peace no further than Lord Owen, but it showed where the man's heart is - so
blatantly on his sleeve that it irritates beyond reason.
Not that it perturbs Bono. If Bosnia cannot accept the mediation of U2, why
not turn his attention to Salman Rushdie. He phones him up, but that is just
a blind. Rushdie is actually back stage and for a hug from Bono exposes
himself before 50,000 people, so great is the power of a superstar.
On top of this canter through good causes U2 put on the most expensive and
the most pleasurably stunning show that you are likely to see this side of
the global recession. The stage is like some gigantic TV station, with vast
screens to project images of everything from drumming Nazis to Martin Luther
King. For no good reason three cars are suspended from the galleys, and
there is a light show of such brilliance that sometimes the stage glows red
like the Devil's kitchen, sometimes gleams white like the very portals of
Heaven.
As if this were not enough, there is a subsidiary stage linked by a catwalk
where the band perform acoustic songs from the new album, a belly dancer
wafts through 'She moves in mysterious ways', and a prone Bono is videoed by
a young Argentinian girl who squats astride him for those vital close ups.
With so much to divert the eye the music hardly needs attention. In fact U2
stick very close to their standard repertoire, and are at their best belting
out hits like 'Streets have no name' as if they were any old rock and roll
band. After all, they look like one; Bono dresses mainly in black leather
and dark glasses, with a switch to Mephistophelean red, plus horns, for the
finale, while guitarist, The Edge, seizes the one chance offered to the rest
of the quartet and growls his way through his solo, 'Numb'.
U2 are seriously mega because they have fine control over their worthy songs
and the confidence to play straight, give or take a massive stage crew and
special effects of De Mille-ian proportions. Apart from the dancer there are
no extra musicians, no backing singers. This is the band. They even manage
to retain street cred and a right-on image while sending up their fans
rotten in a sequence of video confessions taped by extrovert members of the
audience, and leading the life of multi-millionaires. The cracks must be
there but they do not show. The ZOO TV tour is pop as drama, pop as
sensation, but U2 also make sure that the music is not completely forgotten.
See it.

FT  13 AUG 93 / Technology: Stars on a silver disc - Philips and Pioneer are
competing to bring Hollywood to life in the living room
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DELLA BRADSHAW
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Even the most sedentary cinema-goer must once have had a sneaking desire to
stand alongside Clint Eastwood as the showdown loomed or join Indiana Jones
in an escape from marauding tribespeople. Playing out such fantasies on the
television screen is also the dream of film makers and electronics
companies. This autumn European consumers will be bombarded with the first
stage in such dream fulfilment - feature films on a silvery disc.
In a Pounds 3m advertising campaign Philips is promoting full-length films
on compact disc - the five-inch disc already widespread in the music and
computer market. Ironically, they will be challenged by Japanese electronics
company Pioneer, which is promoting in Europe the 12-inch Laserdiscs
developed - and largely abandoned - by Philips over a decade ago.
Laserdisc is acknowledged as the superior product. 'It's like a comparison
between a hardback and a paperbook book,' concedes Simon Turner, director of
Philips Interactive Media Systems.
Laserdisc produces high-quality digital 'surround' sound with broadcast
picture quality, as the large disc size means the picture is not compressed.
Philips' Digital Video, on the other hand, has to squash the pictures to get
an entire film on to CD. For every one piece of data that is included on the
disc another 129 are discarded. When the disc is played the eye does not
notice the compression because the discarded data relates to parts of the
screen that are not changing.
Only the moving parts of the film are updated, resulting in a picture
quality which Philips claims is slightly superior to a VHS video. The
accompanying sound is digital stereo, of a similar quality to that achieved
on audio CD. Digital Video is the final piece in Philips' concept of CD-I
(compact disc interactive) which combines digital images, sound and now
video images for computer games, educational purposes and general
entertainment.
Despite the inferior quality, says Turner, the five-inch disc is the one
consumers identify with and want to buy. 'It's not equivalent to Laserdisc,
but that's of no interest to 95 per cent of the UK population who have never
seen Laserdisc.' Laserdisc, he concludes, is a niche market for the movie
connoisseur.
At Pioneer, Guy Warren, senior manager of marketing and sales for Europe,
begs to differ. Although the technology failed to grab the public
imagination in the 1980s, when there were few recorded films available and
the players were expensive, Laserdisc has since proven popular outside
Europe. In Japan, one in 10 households has a player, and in the US 1m
Laserdisc machines are in use. 'This autumn will probably be a turning point
for Laserdisc in Europe,' predicts Warren. 'There will be several
blockbuster films released.' They will included Basic Instinct, Chaplin and
Universal Soldier. The Laserdisc players sell for Pounds 399, although a
single film costs around Pounds 25. A feature film on Digital Video will
cost less than Dollars 25 (Pounds 17).
In common with Digital Video, and unlike videocassettes, Laserdiscs are
virtually indestructible, and the machines can play audio CDs as well.
Warren believes the growing popularity of large-screen and projection
television sets will fuel demand for these high-quality recordings.
In Europe, Pioneer plans to follow the route that established the technology
in the US: it will buy the rights to blockbuster films and publish them on
Laserdisc in the European Pal television format.
Neither Pioneer nor Philips see their products as a direct competitor for
the VCR. In Japan there is now no market for audio CD players, only for
Laserdisc ones, says Warren. Turner goes one step further. 'Really we see
CD-I as this box which produces many different values in the home. Games
will be much better quality and there will be interactive films.'
Much of Philips' bold advertising campaign will focus on persuading
consumers that CD-I will bring together what used to be a plethora of
distinct media. 'What is interesting is that the traditional delineations in
the publishing and broadcasting industries are disappearing,' Turner says.
'What CD-I is doing is mixing these up.'
For Philips, CD-I forms the basis of a home entertainment system that
combines computer games, digital audio, traditional linear movies and a
combination of movie clips and computer animation. One scenario envisaged by
Philips is the mixture of film footage and computer images  - a chase scene
from Star Wars, for example, where viewers ride alongside Luke Skywalker and
control a space vehicle using a joystick on a CD-I console.
The attraction of such technology has not been lost on Pioneer. It has just
launched Laseractive in the US and Japan and promises a European launch
during 1994. Laseractive is a collaboration between Pioneer, Japanese
electronics manufacturer NEC and games company Sega, and delivers
interactive games and films similar to those on CD-I.
Pioneer is again pushing the superior quality of its product: the larger
storage capacity of Laserdisc enables Laseractive to give an improved
picture quality and superior computer images and interactive software. The
company also believes the greater storage capacity of Laserdisc will enable
the technology to compete with high-definition television, which has a far
greater number of picture elements.
Philips counters by saying CD-I technology will have progressed by the
middle of the decade, the earliest date by which HDTV will be available.
Double density discs will be available using blue lasers, which can be
focused more finely than today's red laser systems.
Warren also argues that on the home-movie front Laserdisc has a further
advantage over CD-I in the run up to the Christmas buying season: the
technology is well-proven and widely available.
This autumn Philips is selling a slot-in cartridge for Pounds 150 which will
upgrade existing CD-I players, bought largely for games software, to enable
them to play feature films and interactive games incorporating Digital
Video. Not until early next year will the company launch a CD-I player with
Digital Video included as a discrete unit. They will also sell a 'black box'
to convert audio CD players to play CD-I discs with Digital Video.
For the harassed parent who views such home entertainment systems as a
threat to domestic peace and quiet there is one further frightening thought:
both CD-I and Laseractive are designed to incorporate home karaoke systems.

Many corporate videos are synonymous with the corporate snooze: 20 minutes
of largely irrelevant ramblings which have to be tolerated in order to glean
one or two pieces of useful information. Many are already out of date just a
few months after being produced.
The result? Many a corporate video quickly ends up with the last batch of
company slides - gathering dust on the shelf.
'There must be a minimum of 500,000 businesses that have produced
audio-visual material in the past four to five years,' says Mike Smith,
managing director of Bradford-based YPL Communications. 'I bet 490,000 of
them are not being used.'
Smith's company specialises in training material and corporate presentations
on the latest electronic media: CD-Rom and Laserdisc.
The Laserdisc system he promotes, under the acronym of Bra (Barcode random
access), allocates a barcode number to each section of the presentation on
the disc. By clicking a light pen over the barcode in the accompanying
catalogue the presentation jumps to the relevant section. Usually the images
appear on a television screen, although the Laserdisc player can be attached
to a projector for larger audiences.
'Bra enables you to produce the presentation from scratch or to take old
linear videos and put them into the system and provide them with a
directory,' says Smith. 'Bra is not particularly good if you need
intelligence. CD-I is probably a better system for that.'
One Laserdisc can incorporate 36 minutes of video, 54,000 slides or a
combination of the two. Each disc has a dual soundtrack - one could be in a
foreign language to promote overseas sales.
One of YPL's most prominent customers is the Patent Office, for which YPL
has installed 170 systems. The disc is used in conjunction with a work book
to explain how the patent system works.
Smith believes that at a cost of under Pounds 10,000 to put ageing slides
and video on disc, many small businesses are overlooking the chance to make
substantial business impact.

FT  13 AUG 93 / People: Rouse puts his toe in the water
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Michael Rouse, who has spent the past 20 years at the Water Research Centre
(WRc), has been headhunted as the next boss of the Drinking Water
Inspectorate for England and Wales.
He succeeds Michael Healey, a Department of the Environment civil servant
responsible for water quality in the run-up to water privatisation who
became the first head when the inspectorate was created at the beginning of
1990.
Healey is now retiring at the age of 60.
Part of the DoE, the inspectorate, which has just 30 staff, monitors the
quality of drinking water supplied by the privatised utilities - by audits
rather than by independent testing - and can take enforcement action if
legal requirements are not being met.
A mechanical engineer by training, Rouse, 53, has been chief executive of
the WRc since 1984, presiding over the 1989 staff buy-out of the centre,
which is now a private company, owned 57 per cent by staff and 43 per cent
by the water companies.
He says he is attracted by the 'public service element' of his next job, as
well as by 'the intellectual challenge' of influencing the debate in
Brussels so that the EC as a whole comes out with realistic standards for
water purity.
Before joining the WRc in 1974, Rouse had been at British Gas, working on
various aspects of high pressure pipelines when gas was first discovered in
the North Sea. From pipelines, it was but a small step to an interest in
water, he explains.

FT  13 AUG 93 / People: McDonald - 'enjoying problems'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Stuart McDonald, former joint chief executive of London &amp; Edinburgh Trust,
has been appointed non-executive chairman of Windsor, a small insurance
broker which dominates the sports insurance market.
McDonald, 49, resigned from LET last September along with the Beckwith
brothers, who founded the property group which was sold to Sweden's SPP for
Pounds 491m at the peak of the UK property market in 1990.
Windsor, which has a stock market capitalisation of just over Pounds 6m, is
recovering from a difficult period when its profits have been hit by a
series of ill-conceived acquisitions and diversifications. The need to write
down the value of a large property led the group to report a pre-tax loss of
Pounds 1.9m in the half year to end-March.
A new chief executive, Mike Eagles, was brought in from Citicorp two years
ago, and the group has been looking for a new chairman to replace Stanley
Cohen who has been doing the job on an interim basis.
McDonald, who first met John Beckwith when they worked as accountants at
Arthur Andersen in the 1960s, spent 14 years with NM Rothschild before
joining LET in 1985. Although he says that he has not been hired by Windsor
for his property expertise, he continues to advise com-panies on property
matters. In May he was appointed to the board of Brent Walker, the heavily
indebted pubs and betting shop group. 'I enjoy working for companies with
problems rather than massive organisations which are plugging along doing
well,' he says.

As silicon chips get smaller, particles of dust on their surface can affect
their performance. Washing the chips is difficult - traditional methods
often leave tiny particles of dust behind. The cleaning process is also bad
for the environment as it relies on chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs).
A small company in Bethesda, Maryland, has come up with an alternative way
to clean silicon wafers which could solve both problems.
The Radiance process uses a laser to excite the particles so that they jump
off the wafer's surface. A flow of gas then blows the particles away.
Radiance intends to charge a royalty for the use of the process. Radiance:

A simple blood test, which could definitively inform expectant mothers
whether their child has genetic abnormalities, is being developed by the
Applied Imaging Corporation of Santa Clara, and the UK's Medical Research
Council.
The only method of prenatal genetic screening in widespread use today is
amniocentesis, an invasive procedure involving the removal of some of the
amniotic fluid surrounding the foetus.
Recently it has become apparent that small numbers of the unborn child's
cells enter the mother's bloodstream. The test being developed extracts
these cells for genetic analysis. Researchers believe it will prove a less
expensive and risky alternative to the amniocentesis test. Applied Imaging

FT  13 AUG 93 / The Property Market: A ride on the rollercoaster of recovery
 -The recent sharp upturn in the UK
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK property market's recovery is gathering pace. A spate of
better-than-expected news on the economy, together with a sea change in
sentiment, is fuelling a far stronger recovery than forecasters expected at
the start of the year.
Since the spring, the amount of money waiting to be invested in the property
market has built up rapidly. Some Pounds 7bn of money had been earmarked for
the property sector, according to Hillier Parker, chartered surveyors.
James Capel, a broker, is now expecting capital values to rise by 10 per
cent this year; and 10 per cent in 1994. 'The investment market is hotter
than at any time since the late 1970s,' says Mr Alan Carter of its property
team.
Some of this enthusiasm is shared by the stock market. On Wednesday when the
FT-SE 100 index broke through the 3,000 mark, property was the best
performing sector of the market with a 2.2 per cent rise.
The value of property shares has nearly doubled in the past year, as
investors look forward to an improvement in the underlying market. The
property sector is now on a premium of 10 per cent to estimated net asset
value, according to brokers UBS. That compares with a 10 year average
discount of 23.7 per cent.
Not everyone is convinced that the enthusiasm for property is justified. The
market is overheating in the view of some participants, such as Mr Clive
Lewis, president of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors.
Certainly, there is little evidence that the end of the recession has had an
impact on tenant demand. Rents are still falling: Richard Ellis, a firm of
surveyors, estimates that they have fallen by 7.3 per cent this year.
Improvement in tenant demand is still extremely weak, not least because many
occupiers still have empty space in their buildings.
Some observers also feel disconcerted that property appears to be bucking
its traditional role of being one of the last sectors of the economy to
respond to an upturn in the economic cycle.
But this point begs the question of how much the current behaviour of the
property sector has in common with previous cycles.
In some respects, there are strong parallels. Consider, for instance, this
assessment of the market in the FT's Lex column in February 1975. With the
exception of the quantity of bank debt overhanging the market, the comment
would have been valid 18 years later:
'The immediate problem, however, is establishing a new level of values,
given the unsettling influences of the amount of property for sale, the
Pounds 2.8bn of banking lending to the property sector still to be unwound,
the recessionary threat to rents and the uncertainties about the
government's detailed land proposals.
'But the longer-term bull arguments remain - property's record as an
inflation hedge, the weight of institutional money in short-term assets and
the impact of the current cutback on new development on the supply of space
in two or three years' time.'
But the differences between these periods are possibly more striking than
the similarities. Consider, for instance, property's relationship with gilts
and equities, which is entirely different from the 1970s. Property yields at
about 9 per cent are now higher than gilt yields and far higher than equity
yields, which stand at 3.7 per cent. In the 1970s, by contrast, property
yields were close to equity yields and far below gilt yields.
The consequence of this changed relationship is that property responds far
more readily to changes in the bond market. 'For the first time in 30 years,
property has bond characteristics, rather than equity characteristics,' says
Mr David Tunstall of Smith New Court.
As a result, the current bull market in bonds is forcing down property
yields. Hillier Parker this week said that yields had dropped by a further
0.1 percentage points for August, pushing the All Property average yield
down to 9 per cent. In some sectors where reasonable rental growth is
expected, yields have dropped by 1-1.5 points over the last six months, it
says.
According to Hillier Parker, this is the first improvement in yields since
August 1988, when yields stood at 7.2 per cent. It believes the improvement
in yields is set to continue. 'With renewed interest, particularly from
institutional investors, the market is now gradually moving from one of few
buyers and many potential vendors of a year ago, to many more buyers than
sellers,' it says.
Some agents are forecasting an extremely rapid fall in yields. Savills, a
firm of chartered surveyors, believes that yields will move by an average of
2 percentage points by the end of the year. It expects retail warehouse
yields to be 7 per cent, office yields to fall below 7.5 per cent, prime
retail yields to drop to 5-5 1/4 per cent and industrial yields to fall to 8
per cent.
Can the market maintain this pace? Some analysts believe the unexpected
strength of the recovery this year means next year's growth will be slower
than anticipated.
In the view of Mr Chris Turner of BZW, the improvement in values will slow
down next year. If falling gilt yields cease to bolster the market, the
continued progress in property values will depend on the outlook for rental
growth, which is still uncertain.
Most surveyors do not expect rents to begin to grow until the second half of
1994. But it is hard to generalise. Much depends on the economic performance
of different cities and the balance of supply and demand. A recent report by
Chesterton showed that vacancy rates for new or refurbished office property
ranges from 0.7 per cent in Manchester to 8.4 per cent in the City of London
and 38 per cent in Docklands. London's vacancy rate stands at 17.8 per cent,
while outside London, the average city vacancy rate is 11.5 per cent.
Overall, about 44m sq ft of office floorspace is available to let in the
UK's largest 16 cities, representing 15.3 per cent of their total stock. New
and refurbished floorspace accounts for over 40 per cent of the total
available space. As demand improves, this space will become more attractive
to potential occupiers at the expense of the secondary market. 'Poor quality
secondary properties, or those in fringe and unproven locations, may be
suitable only for redevelopment,' it says.
The question of how fast rental growth will return depends on several
factors, such as the amount of second-hand space that is taken out of the
market for redevelopment and the speed of the recovery of the development
market.
More than anything else, however, the outlook for rental growth depends on
the robustness of the economy. The UK needs a period of low interest rates
and strong growth, if the recovery in the property market is to keep its
momentum.

FT  13 AUG 93 / Management: Tailoring offices to more modest times
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER LORENZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Jacques Attali would not have believed his eyes. Nor, for that matter, would
the fiercest critics of his free-spending antics at the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development. Even my humble taxi driver and I could
scarcely credit it. After 10 minutes of searching up and down a Swiss city
street, full of solid, multi-storey stone offices, we found the headquarters
of the Pounds 1.7bn business we were seeking: an unassuming timber block
which we had passed several times.
The single-storey building was more reminiscent of a British post-war
austerity 'prefab' or a Nissen hut than the base of a thrusting worldwide
business. At best, it resembled a works canteen, or a cricket pavilion.
Inside, all was creaky floors and dark linoleum. Even the boss's office,
with its simple desk, table and chairs, was graced only by a warn oriental
carpet.
To a British eye, accustomed to all the marble, glitz and soaring atria with
which corporate offices have been embroidered under American influence over
the past 15 years, it certainly looked out of place. But could - or should -
it be the shape of things to come?
In a literal sense, obviously not: the 40-year-old building has worn well,
but is less functional than it looks: its long corridors and inflexible
partitions would impede the pattern of shifting group-work needed in most
modern organisations. On the sweltering day of my visit, its lack of proper
ventilation was annoying. And if it were built today, its poor 'plot' ratio
(office space to site area) would give any modern developer a heart attack.
Yet it stands for a principle that, with the glaring exception of banking,
shows signs of returning to the very status-conscious Anglo-Saxon corporate
world: that head-office buildings should not only be cost-effective, but
should also reflect the individual character of the organisations within
them, rather than some glossy theatrical norm. Since the nature of most
organisations is changing, so should that of their HQs.
It is a coincidence, but a most appropriate one, that the Swiss business I
visited is in the midst of 're-engineering' its various processes, in common
with many other European and American companies. In such organisations,
processes which span such activities as order processing and logistics are
being redesigned from scratch. Each unnecessary step is being stripped out.
The same criterion should be applied to head offices. For both cost and
psychological reasons, it is inappropriate for a 're-engineered'
organisation to continue to occupy an HQ equipped with superfluous but
expensive bells, whistles and decorations. If it really wants to remain lean
and ultra-productive, and not re-accumulate fat, it must signal that
intention to its employees at all levels, especially to its managers.
This does not mean every company must move into Nissen huts, nor that we
should return to the awful uniformity - and functional inadequacy - of the
grey, faceless 1960s office block. Good designers can do far better than
that.
All around the world there are plenty of restrained, head-office buildings.
In Japan some, like that of Brother, resemble little more than distribution
depots. Many other companies have also resisted the temptation to follow
most of their country's electronics and carmakers into ritzy, American-style
corporate palaces.
In the west, various HQs epitomise a form of understated grace which is
worthy of any multinational anywhere: the most impressive are low-rise
structures in Silicon Valley, such as those of Intel and Hewlett-Packard. In
a different physical and development environment, the converted mills of
several of their New England rivals, notably Digital, rate equally highly.
European instances include Electrolux's sparse Stockholm HQ, a former
factory. Its conversion was done with none of the interior ostentation of
several recent refurbishments of well-known London buildings, including the
former HQ of this newspaper.
Whether a rehabilitated building is low or high rise, and was formerly
industrial or commercial, the process of stripping out the old interior and
replacing it with lean, purpose-designed office facilities, is obviously a
form of 're-engineering'. But this does not mean that no re-engineered
organisation should build anew; it is arguable that new-build is closer than
rehab to the 'redesign from scratch' principle of re-engineering.
Whether they redesign, or build from scratch, organisations of every kind
should tailor their buildings to their peculiar requirements, both internal
and external. In doing so, they must consider their employees' current - and
future - working patterns, motivation and productivity. And they must weigh
carefully the sort of external image they wish to project into a
cost-conscious world.
Organisations whose fortunes are based largely on image-creation, such as
advertising agencies, will continue to require a fair degree of opulence and
show in their buildings. But this does not necessarily entail vast cost;
ingenuity is more important. Even a company which wants to broadcast its
high-tech glamour by using the latest building technology need not spend the
earth if it has a good architect.
Most other types of organisation, should rein back their glitz and glamour
by several degrees at least. They cannot do so instantly, since neither
refurbishment nor new-build is an economic proposition for most of them in
the current state of the office market.
But, as more and more scale down their head offices for strategic or cost
reasons, and need more modest-sized accommodation as a result, it will be
instructive to see which of them tone down their opulence as well, and what
character they create in its place.
Shareholders and competitors, as well as re-engineering and design
consultants, should monitor developments closely.

FT  13 AUG 93 / Management: A literary union - Martin Mulligan examines how
the fledgling Hodder Headline is coping with post-merger uncertainty /
Euromanagers to watch
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN MULLIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A merger's aftermath is a tense time in any industry and nowhere more so
than in the volatile world of book publishing. When the merged firms
represent two very different kinds of publishing, the friction can be
intense.
Tim Hely Hutchinson, group chief executive of the new-born Hodder Headline,
should be keenly aware of the dangers he faces. More than a decade ago
Robert Maxwell headhunted him to help restore order to the industrial chaos
after the merger of the aggressive, young Futura paperbacks and the
established, hard-cover house Macdonald. A bitter staff dispute about
redundancies at Macdonald lasted four months and Pounds 1.5m was lost in the
year before Hely Hutchinson took charge. When he left in 1986 the company
was once again in profit.
Today, however, he is facing an arguably greater challenge with the merger
of his ambitious young company Headline and the venerable, privately-owned
Hodder &amp; Stoughton, which has created the fifth largest British publishing
group.
Hely Hutchinson's career at 39 resembles that of an executive character from
a fast-paced thriller on his own Headline list. He is single and drives a
silver Alfa Romeo. He is descended from Irish aristocracy - the family seat
is in County Tipperary. The son of the Earl of Donoughmore, Eton and Oxford
educated, his background blends a colourful cocktail of romantic appeal and
success that feature writers have detailed ad nauseam.
The years spent working in Maxwell's shadow provide a rich source of
anecdotes and questions. How, for instance, did he thwart Maxwell's regular
attempts to turn Macdonald into his own personal publishing house? Hely
Hutchinson confirms that he stalled Maxwell's pet projects by turning a
blind eye to the telescope, encouraging the chief quietly to abandon his
craziest schemes. 'I had two jobs - running Macdonald and running a
relationship with Maxwell,' he says.
His ambition for Headline - the firm he founded with venture capital and the
expertise of his colleagues Sian Thomas and Sue Fletcher in 1986 - was
evident from the start. 'Headline was always the platform to do something
substantial; it was never going to be just a niche player,' he says.
A profit-driven, popular consumer publisher from the outset - as you might
expect from the publisher of Follies of the Flesh, The Hello] Cookbook and
Buddy Holly is Alive and Well on Ganymede - Headline was never going to fit
the traditional British publishing mould. Hodder, by contrast, represents
just that: a respected family firm founded in 1868 with an evangelical
purpose, boasting an established educational division, and a distinguished
backlist which includes Le Carre, Enid Blyton and the Bible.
Hely Hutchinson has a vision of 'a conglomerate with soul'. What he has on
his hands for the moment are two very recently separate publishing entities
and editors on each side who start from different publishing assumptions. It
will take undoubted energy and diplomacy to co-ordinate them without mishap.
He plays down the merger's possible hazards. 'I do not see that there will
be any culture clash, especially as the lists differ so,' he says. Nor is he
uneasy at the expansion from 170 to more than 600 staff.
His advice to managers in the midst of merger is: act swiftly. 'There are
inevitable fears, uncertainty and unhappiness in the early days of a merger.
I intend to get these out of the way as quickly as possible.' He regards
'bottlenecking' or vacillating about decisions as the worst sin a manager
can commit.
He is clearly uncomfortable though when it comes to discussing the ultimate
size of Hodder Headline. 'The immediate thrusts of the merger will be to
reduce costs and simultaneously to stimulate growth in the editorial
departments, as Hodder &amp; Stoughton has been starved of resources during the
past few years,' he says, quickly adding: 'No one needs to feel threatened.
I don't recognise any differences between people as to their origins within
the group. Everyone within the group now is Hodder Headline; it doesn't
matter where they came from. No division is for sale.'
So far, 72 jobs have gone, two-thirds falling on the administrative side of
the business. A relocation will follow next spring when Hodder's old
distribution centre near Sevenoaks in Kent is closed, affecting about 150
people. Headline's distribution company, Bookpoint, in Abingdon, Berkshire,
will be expanded and 70 people taken on. Hely Hutchinson says that with
these measures the 'major UK job saving programme' will be complete.
The need to safeguard Headline's entrepreneurial spirit which has brought it
so far - from a share price of 87.55 when it came to market in April 1991 to
today's 355, and figuring frequently in the bestseller lists with Dean
Koontz's supernatural thrillers and Ellis Peters' medieval whodunnits -
ranks high on his list of priorities.
Hodder Headline will comprise autonomous sales teams for 10 separate lists,
able in theory to react more quickly to perceived openings in the market.
Each unit will be headed by its own managing director. Martin Neild, former
key accounts director of Pan Macmillan, is to run fiction and non-fiction.
Hely Hutchinson explains: 'A publisher must be good at buying and at
selling. Selling books is not like selling socks or shirts; the judgments
require more subtlety. The industry is relatively short of all-rounders who
are competent to buy and sell.' His conclusion is that the all-rounders
heading his divisions should be free to trust their publishing intuitions
and, crucially, to remain sensitive to feedback from retailers.
Is this dream of a versatile publishing giant, formed of such heterogeneous
units and guaranteeing quality at the same time as profits, truly
attainable? Hely Hutchinson's growing number of fans insist he will be able
to carry it off. His progress across the Hodder Headline tightrope will be
watched with industry-wide fascination.

FT  13 AUG 93 / Bomb-damaged church to reopen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE of the oldest victims of the Baltic Exchange bomb is about to resume
duties. After careful restoration of its stained-glass windows and
stonework, the 12th-century St Andrew Undershaft is to reopen on September
1, 18 months after the IRA bomb that exploded in the heart of the City.
The church, in St Mary Axe, was about 100 yards from the centre of the blast
and its three large stained-glass windows were severely damaged. Yesterday
craftsmen were beginning the final phase of replacing the most badly damaged
panels of the window in the church's east wing.
The repair work has been undertaken by Goddard and Gibbs, the stained-glass
manufacturers. Its craftsmen removed the remains of the 15ft by 30ft windows
to the company's workshop for the painstaking task of reconstruction.
Because few photographs of the windows existed, the blast area had to be
carefully swept for traces of glass fragments. For the east window, the
designers had to work from a small photograph showing just one-third of the
100-year-old depiction of the crucifixion and resurrection. Much of the time
since has been spent redesigning the missing elements.
Installation will take up to three weeks as the workmen replace each panel
individually. These are slotted into the grooves of the surrounding
stonework and held in place by horizontal supporting bars. Copper tie bars
are used for additional support.
So far one window, on the north side of the church, has been fully restored.
However, the third and west window was almost completely blown out. Its
restoration is not expected to be completed before October.
Mr Christopher Borst, Goddard and Gibbs sales director, said that the main
difficulty had been in trying to track down detailed photographs of the
windows.
He said: 'The information has not been comprehensive and there have been
several large holes where we have been working fairly much in the dark.'
The company is one of about a dozen stained-glass manu-facturers and
restorers in the UK.

FT  13 AUG 93 / Rover returns to health in a sickly climate: BAe is free to
sell its vehicle maker, but there are sound reasons for keeping it
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FROM TODAY British Aerospace is free to sell Rover Group, the former BL Cars
and Land Rover business of which BAe was the surprise buyer, for Pounds
150m, five years ago.
There has been much speculation that BAe would seek to unload Rover for a
tidy profit as soon as the government's privatisation terms made it
possible. Current valuation estimates of the business range around Pounds
500m.
Yet there is no queue of prospective buyers. There is also no sign that BAe
is even preparing to hang out the 'for sale' sign, with Rover on the verge
of returning to trading profit and being the only carmaker boasting
increased sales in depressed European Community markets.
Volkswagen/Audi, whose dash for European market supremacy through
acquisition once made it a favourite to snap up Rover, is too financially
troubled.
Ford almost certainly would have felt obliged to prevent a VW takeover. But
it is making heavy losses of its own.
'The best result is that Rover remains the industrial equivalent of
Belgium,' says Professor Garel Rhys of Cardiff Business School's motor
industry research centre, who is one of the leading analysts of the vehicle
group's fortunes.
Nor are other large players circling Rover with any apparent interest. Even
Honda, with which Rover has a 20 per cent cross-shareholding, professes no
desire for control, although it may consider a slightly increased
shareholding.
One reason is the depressed climate in which the European motor industry is
operating. West European sales are down 17.7 per cent so far this year. Yet
even if the climate were better, Ford's struggle to make its Pounds 1.6bn
purchase of Jaguar pay, and General Motors' similar struggles with Saab,
have made the industry wary.
Vehicle companies struggling to make the grade can be deep financial pits
and Rover in its various previous guises - as BL, British Leyland and BMC -
has been among the deepest.
Over nearly two decades, Pounds 3.5bn of British taxpayers' funds were
poured into its operations before privatisation.
The fundamental question now is whether the UK's climb out of its steepest
post-war car sales slump and Rover's strong progress in continental Europe
and North America are enough to provide it with a viable long-term future.
As Prof Rhys and other motor industry analysts point out, Rover has had an
embarrassing number of 'false dawns' in which supposedly attractive new
model programmes have failed to live up to their promise and brief spurts
into profitability have fallen back into loss and indebtedness.
Rover has only recently begun reversing its prolonged market-share decline
in the UK, from more than 40 per cent in the 1960s to 13 per cent to 14 per
cent by the early 1990s.
Prof Rhys says: 'That Rover has become a small player in the European
industry has been perceived as it simply being a failed mass producer. But
there is a growing perception that its relative smallness is now by choice,
as a specialist manufacturer.'
It is increasingly accepted that the serious push to take Rover's products
up-market, started by former chairman Sir Graham Day and developed by his
successor Mr George Simpson and colleagues such as managing director Mr John
Towers, is working.
The smaller 200/400 car range has re-established Rover as a serious
competitor in this market segment. After a Pounds 200m investment to
transform production facilities at Cowley, Oxford, the Rover 800 has become
a market leader in the UK executive car sector. Comparisons of the recently
launched Rover 600 with BMW provides further evidence that the strategy is
working. The 600's Honda Accord counterpart is being built by Honda at
Swindon.
Production of Discovery and Range Rover models cannot keep pace with demand,
and Rover expects to quadruple sales of these vehicles, to 16,000 units
annually, in the US alone over the next two years.
Cowley reflects the new flexibility in production processes and among the
company's 33,000-strong workforce. The plant is able to build the ageing
Montego and Maestro models for as long as demand at even a few thousand a
year persists.
Alongside that process, the MG RV8 sports car, one of a growing number of
niche vehicles being brought to market by Rover's new special projects
division, is being virtually assembled by hand. Mr Towers points out that
everyone at Cowley, from managers to receptionists, is a standby member of
assembly-line teams.
Large productivity improvements - a claimed 18 per cent at Cowley so far
this year - and the introduction of 'lean' distribution which has taken
thousands of cars out of the supply pipeline, are also driving costs down.
Mr Towers says Rover is close to its target of financial break even at
400,000 cars a year. Last year's production was only 405,000, however, and
output is down marginally again this year.
Analysts still expect Rover to achieve a trading profit of Pounds 30m to
Pounds 50m this year due mainly to its rigorous cost-cutting. Yet with
current debts of some Pounds 400m Rover would still be making a net loss.
Next year recovery should lift profits to between Pounds 90m and Pounds 100m
and Rover should move closer to its proclaimed ideal volume of about 500,000
vehicles a year.
Analysts are asking whether, given the fiercely competitive state of
markets, such a volume will be enough to provide adequate profitability
while sustaining investments of more than Pounds 200m a year. Prof Rhys
believes that Rover may have to lift output substantially beyond the 500,000
level.
Between its Longbridge and Cowley plants Rover retains a theoretical
capacity of nearly 1m units. To utilise capacity more effectively would
require new models.
Nevertheless Rover's management ranks maintain that sustained viability is
no longer in doubt. Those ranks may well seek to stake their futures on that
view. There is growing talk of a management buy-out proposal for next
spring.

<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE National Health Service will no longer pay for nicotine smoking
cessation patches, under proposals announced by the government yesterday,
Paul Abrahams writes.
The proposal is part of a larger package detailing products which doctors
will no longer be allowed to prescribe, part of the government's efforts to
control the burgeoning NHS drugs bill which last year grew 14 per cent.
The products range from Perrier, Malvern and Evian mineral waters to Ambre
Solaire sun cream, aromatherapy massage oil, Johnson &amp; Johnson's prickly
heat powder, and Pickles' nail bite lotion.
Details of the drugs on the first of 10 categories on the new NHS blacklists
were also given. The category, for topical anti-rheumatics, included 40
medicines.
Among them were American Home Products' Algipan, SmithKline Beecham's Ralgex
and its Beecham analgesic cream, Boots' Menthol and Wintergreen Embrocation,
and Culpepper's Healing ointment.
Companies and patient groups now have a month in which to respond.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE number of trucks above 3.5 tonnes gross vehicle weight operating in the
UK fell by nearly 3.5 per cent last year to 415,000.
Truck sales have more than halved since the peak reached in 1989.
The total stock of trucks licensed in the UK is at its lowest level for 10
years, according to a report published yesterday by the Department of
Transport.
The decline was partly due to the recession but it also reflected the
continuing trend towards the use of heavier vehicles, according to the
report.

A SECOND dairy farmer has died of the brain disorder Creutzfeld-Jacob
Disease, which is similar to the 'mad cow' disease BSE, Clive Cookson

Professor Richard Lacey of Leeds University, a critic of government policy

Several animals in Mr Templeman's Somerset diary herd had BSE.
But the Department of Health said: 'The government's expert advisers have

FT  13 AUG 93 / Water bills 'hit poor hardest'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
POOR HOUSEHOLDS spend proportionately more on water and sewerage charges
than the rich, and this would change little under the alternatives being
considered for a new way of charging.
This is a central conclusion of a report by the Institute for Fiscal Studies
for Ofwat, the water regulator, yesterday.
At present Water charges are based on the rateable value of a property, a
system which has to be replaced by the year 2000. This system is seen to
have two principal weaknesses: single people living in large houses pay more
for water than large families in small houses, and it provides no incentive
for people to conserve water.
The study looked at four alternative ways of charging:
A licence fee under which all households pay the same.
A licence fee would have to be set at around Pounds 152 a household to
generate the present water industry revenues. But poorest households
currently pay an average Pounds 127.49 for their water so they would lose
out. By contrast the richest households pay just under Pounds 180 so they
would be big gainers. Overall, 41 per cent of households would be better
off.
A charge based on the number of people in a household.
Such a charge would have two elements, a Pounds 6 standing charge and Pounds
55.96 a person. Poorest households would pay nearly Pounds 127, almost
exactly what they pay now, but the richest would pay about Pounds 144. The
big gainers would be pensioners whose charges would fall from Pounds 146 to
Pounds 105.
A charge based on the type of property.
Charges banded by house type showed poorest households paying nearly Pounds
140 and the richest Pounds 160, nearly Pounds 20 less than now. Pensioners
would end up paying slightly more.
A charge based on the volume of water consumed by each household.
If meters were introduced to charge for water by volume, poor households,
which include most pensioners, would gain slightly, so would the richest
households because of the switch from their high rateable values.
Middle-income houses, however, would end up paying more.
The report does not say which system is preferable. But it points out that
more households gain than lose on charges based on the number of people in
the household.
Mr Ian Byatt, the director-general of Ofwat, favours metering because
Ofwat's studies have shown that people think water should be paid for by
volume.
He welcomed the report and said: 'It is interesting to see that a number of
household types would gain from metering - including some on lower incomes.
But I recognise that there would also be losers.'
Each of the water companies in England and Wales can choose its own charging
method. So far only one company, Anglian Water, has made a choice, in favour
of metering.

FT  13 AUG 93 / Traces of pesticide found in eels
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Department of Health yesterday issued a warning after pesticide traces
were found in eels.
It said it was 'prudent to limit consumption' of eels caught in the Humber,
Yorkshire Ouse, Thames, the Itchen and Test in Hampshire, the Severn, and
Trent. People in the Humber, Yorkshire Ouse and inshore Thames areas were
advised to limit consumption to 1lb a month, while eels from the Itchen,
Severn, Test and Trent could be consumed at 3lb a month.
Friends of the Earth called it a 'serious contamination of the food chain'.
Government officials said their advice was 'purely precautionary'.

FT  13 AUG 93 / Leading condom maker claims technical advance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LONDON International Group, the health products and toiletries company which
is the world leader in branded condoms, yesterday said it had developed a
polyurethane material which represented an advance in condom technology.
LIG said the material, trademarked Duron, had advantages over latex -
normally used to make condoms - which made it more acceptable to users. The
group's shares closed up 12p to 213p.
It claims 23 per cent of the world's branded condom market, with names such
as Durex in the UK, Ramses and Sheik in North America, Hatu in Italy and
London in Germany.
Dr Bill Potter, the group's scientific affairs director, said Duron was
twice as strong as latex and could therefore be made much thinner, giving
greater sensitivity. It was also, transparent, odourless, and hypoallergenic
 -less likely to cause allergic reactions than latex - and not damaged by
oil-based lubricants. It has all the attributes of latex in terms of
reliability and effectiveness against pregnancy and disease, including Aids,
he said.
Dr Potter said that in tests, Duron had proved it could be an effective
barrier to viruses much smaller than HIV, the Aids virus.
Mr Tony Butterworth, chief executive of LIG, said the group had spent Pounds
10m during the past five years developing the product, including building a
pilot plant at its Cambridge research facility.
This would produce condoms for test marketing, which would start in the US
next year and be extended to other countries depending on regulatory
approvals. The material has already won US Food and Drug Administration
clearance, and key parts of the manufacturing process have been patented.
Mr Clive Kitchener, LIG director of marketing, said the condoms would sell
at a substantial price premium to latex ones, but market research showed
people would pay more for a better product. He said the group still expected
growth in the latex condom market and that condoms made from Duron would
expand the market, attracting new users.
Mr Butterworth said the group would build one or more full-scale production
units once results from test marketing were clearer.

FT  13 AUG 93 / NHS ends nicotine patch payments
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE National Health Service will no longer pay for nicotine smoking
cessation patches, under proposals announced by the government yesterday.
This is in spite of the government's declared policy that the number of
smokers in the UK should be cut by a third by the year 2000.
The proposal is part of a larger package detailing products which doctors
will no longer be allowed to prescribe, part of the government's efforts to
control the burgeoning NHS drugs bill which last year grew 14 per cent.
The products range from Perrier, Malvern and Evian mineral waters to Ambre
Solaire sun cream, aromatherapy massage oil, Johnson &amp; Johnson's prickly
heat powder, Pickles' nail bite lotion, and Smith &amp; Nephew's Simple Talcum
Powder.
Details of the drugs to be included in the first of 10 categories on the new
NHS blacklists were also given. The category, for topical anti-rheumatics,
included 40 medicines.
Among them were American Home Products' Algipan, SmithKline Beecham's Ralgex
and its Beecham analgesic cream, Boots' Menthol and Wintergreen Embrocation,
and Culpepper's Healing ointment. Companies and patient groups now have a
month in which to respond.
The Department of Health said the advisory committees deciding which drugs
should be included in the other nine categories were due to report before
the end of the year. These include oral contraceptives, anti-diarrhoeals,
hypnotics and anxiolytics, and skin diseases.
Dr Brian Mawhinney, minister for health, said: 'Our proposals will not
disadvantage patients. A full range of other products remain available on
the NHS.'
Nicotine patches had a role to play in helping some people stop smoking, but
people who could afford to smoke could also afford to buy products that help
them give up, he said.
The main smoking cessation products no longer available on prescription are
were Nicabate, marketed by Marion Merrell Dow of the US, and Nicorette, sold
by Kabi of Sweden. Nicotinell from Ciba in Switzerland was already not
available on the NHS.

FT  13 AUG 93 / Accounts panel acts on criticism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FINANCIAL Reporting Review Panel, the accounts watchdog, is considering
providing more information on the reasons behind its rulings.
The initiative is one of several changes being considered as part of its
first procedural overhaul since it began operations two years ago.
The move follows representations from the Institute of Chartered Accountants
in England and Wales calling for greater information on the review panel's
decisions.
It marks a greater openness about the reasons for its judgments on
companies, which are given in public announcements.
Some accountants have criticised the verdicts of the review panel, and have
said it was difficult to assess the judgments without knowledge of how they
were reached.
The issue was highlighted in a decision this week by the institute after it
had investigated the panel's criticism last year of Trafalgar House, the
construction, property, shipping and hotels group.
Trafalgar House was forced to amend its 1991 accounts after criticism from
the panel of its decision to charge a Pounds 102.7m deficit on a revaluation
of properties directly to reserves. The institute ruled that there was no
case to answer against any of its members.
It is believed that the institute was provided with no information on the
reasons behind the review panel's verdict, with which Trafalgar House
complied after an initial refusal.
Other changes to the panel's procedures being considered include ways to
simplify and speed up administration of cases, and greater opportunities to
clarify facts before cases are formally undertaken.
The changes are likely to debated and introduced over the next two to three
months.

FT  13 AUG 93 / Jobless total rises in north and falls further in south
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SMALL seasonally adjusted rise in unemployment last month was
concentrated in Scotland and the north of England, while the south saw
another fall.
The tiny 200 increase in the number of people out of work and claiming
benefit was the first for six months and led some economists to suggest that
recent drops in unemployment reflected a temporary reversal from the large
job losses at the end of last year.
The unemployment rate remains highest in Northern Ireland, where it is 14
per cent of the workforce, and in the north and the south-east including
Greater London, where it is 12.2 per cent and 11.6 per cent respectively.
Unemployment tends to rise in July as school leavers enter the job market,
and the Department of Employment said it could not totally adjust for the
big flows. It believes that the basic trend in the jobless total is
downwards, in spite of the latest small increase.
The figures contained some encouraging indicators, including a strong rise
in vacancies - generally a precursor to falls in unemployment - and a rise
in manufacturing employment.
The stock of vacancies at Jobcentres - about one third of all vacancies in
the economy - rose by 7,900 in July to reach their highest level for more
than two years. Over the three months to July, seasonally adjusted vacancies
rose on average by 1,400 per month.
Latest figures show that while unemployment was falling earlier this year,
the size of the workforce also declined. The workforce in employment was
24,882,000 in March, 61,000 fewer than in the previous quarter. Employment
over the year to March fell by 744,000.
However, manufacturing employment increased by 16,000 in June after falling
6,000 in May, the sharpest rise for six years. Manufacturing employment has
risen for two consecutive quarters, but fell 207,000 over the year to June.
The numbers of those unemployed for more than six months fell in the quarter
ending July by 18,000, the first drop in the long-term unemployed for 2 1/2
years. Those jobless for more than a year rose by 6,000 in the latest
quarter, the smallest quarterly rise for almost three years.
The number of people joining the count last month was 438,000, some 10,000
fewer than in July last year.

FT  13 AUG 93 / MPs condemn plan to restrict sea fishing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government's controversial plans to restrict the number of days the
fishing fleet can spend at sea are 'unnecessarily draconian' and should be
abandoned, the Commons agriculture committee says today.
The measures 'amount to little more than decommissioning on the cheap', it
says in a report on the effects of conservation measures on the sea fishing
industry. 'They carry the risk that the UK fleet will suffer a catastrophic
financial implosion.'
Instead of the measures, the committee proposes that each fishing boat be
allocated an individual quota for types of fish its crew wish to catch.
Fishermen would initially have to buy 'individual transferable quotas',
possibly by government auction.
'The government could then intervene in the market by buying quotas to
reduce fishing effort,' says the committee. 'Alternatively, as occurs in
other quota systems, a percentage of each quota could be shaved off to
reduce fishing effort.'
The quotas could be traded, through the government or via a private-sector
quota market, so that fishermen could buy extra quotas from colleagues to
cover fish for which they did not have an allocation and which would
otherwise have been thrown back into the sea.
The restrictions, due to be introduced next January, affect all vessels over
10 metres.
'The government's position would have been far more defensible if it had
only applied days-at-sea restrictions where an urgent need to protect
defined stocks could unequivocally be demonstrated,' says the committee.
The government is introducing the measures as part of its effort to cut
fleet capacity by 19 per cent by 1996, under a European Community agreement
to conserve over-exploited fish stocks. The government intends that the
restrictions should achieve a capacity reduction of up to 8.5 per cent. The
rest of the cuts would be obtained through a Pounds 25m programme of
decommissioning and licensing controls on all fishing vessels.
The committee, which took evidence from ministers, civil servants,
fishermen's representatives, fish processors and retailers, and
conservationists, describes the decommissioning scheme as 'half-hearted' and
says more money should be made available.
The committee, which is chaired by Sir Jerry Wiggin, Tory MP for
Weston-super-Mare and a former junior agriculture minister, also argues for
conservation measures such as larger mesh sizes for nets, so fewer young
fish are caught.
'One of the most telling weaknesses' of the EC common fisheries policy is
the discrepancy between member states' enforcement of conservation rules,
the report says.
The UK, for example, has 152 shore-based inspectors compared with only 12
for Spain, according to Euro-pean Commission estimates.
It adds: 'Procedures must be improved to encourage openness and transparency
in all member states' inspection arrangements, so that comparisons and
judgments can be made between them.'
Mrs Gillian Shephard, minister for agriculture and fisheries, welcomed the
report saying it endorsed the need to conserve fish stocks, but any new
measures would have to be accepted by the EC. She added that the industry
had already rejected a proposal for transferable quotas.

FT  13 AUG 93 / Growth in earnings declines to 3.5%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AVERAGE EARNINGS growth slowed to an underlying 3.5 per cent in the year to
June, pushed down by low publicsector pay settlements.
The June increase was  1/4 of a percentage point lower than in May and the
smallest for 25 years.
The latest slowdown was concentrated in services where the government's 1.5
per cent pay ceiling has brought settlements down sharply.
In the year to June average earnings in the services sector rose an
underlying 2 3/4 per cent compared with 3 per cent in the year to May.
Service-sector earnings growth has dropped from 4.3 per cent at the start of
the year.
In manufacturing, where economic recovery is raising overtime payments,
earnings rose an underlying 5 per cent in June compared with a year ago. It
has been at this level since February.
Average earnings have dropped virtually every month since the start of last
year. Throughout most of the recession they were static at about 7 per cent,
before starting to fall a year ago.

FT  13 AUG 93 / Interest loss of Pounds 4.5m in port sell-offs criticised
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS and RACHEL JOHNSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DELAYS DURING the privatisation of the first five trust ports cost the
government at least Pounds 4.5m, the National Audit Office, the
public-spending watchdog, says in a report today.
Sir John Bourn, comptroller and auditor-general, said although the five
sales were completed by March last year, generating a Pounds 169m levy for
the government, only Pounds 54.4m was paid to the Department of Transport at
the time.
The remaining Pounds 114.6m was left unpaid until February and March this
year because of disagreements between the ports and the department over the
expenses incurred. The interest lost, assuming simple Treasury bill rates,
was at least Pounds 4.5m for the six months to last December alone.
The office says the department should have sought legal advice on whether it
had the right to require further interim payments, and it suggests changes
in the process when further ports are privatised.
Yet the office's general conclusion was that the department had been
'successful in this first stage of the privatisation of the trust ports'. It
backed the controversial decision to sell the Tees and Hartlepool port
authority to the second-highest bidder, Teesside Holdings, for Pounds 180m.
Sir John repeated the department's judgment that to reject the port
authority's recommendation solely in order to maximise the levy proceeds
would be hard to justify.
Tees and Hartlepool, Clyde, Forth, Medway and Tilbury all privatised
voluntarily last year. They account for more than half the turnover of the
15 ports whose turnover exceeds Pounds 5m at 1991 prices. These ports can be
forced to be sold to the private sector under the Ports Act 1991. The five
privatisations took place before the act came into force.
Gross proceeds from the sale of the five ports came to Pounds 380m. The
government received Pounds 169m of the proceeds as statutory levy, while the
cost of the sale amounted to Pounds 12.8m. The port authorities spent Pounds
9.6m of this, while Pounds 2.2m went to management and employee buy-out
teams. The remaining Pounds 1m was paid to the department's advisers.
The department's marketing produced a 'sound basis for competition', with
the four tendered sales producing between six and 19 inquiries. The fifth
port, Forth, was sold by flotation.
However, Sir John said competition was limited in the final bidding for
Clyde, where two of the three bids were unsatisfactorily low, and for
Medway, where a withdrawal left only one bidder.

FT  13 AUG 93 / Maverick building society may be on the side of the angel:
C&amp;G's unconventional approach
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU and NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHELTENHAM &amp; Gloucester has long been regarded as a maverick among building
societies. Yesterday's decision to withdraw from the selling of
insurance-related products goes against the industry trend and sets it apart
from the other top 10 societies.
Bancassurance - the sale of insurance-related products through bank-type
outlets - is widely believed by the financial services industry to be a
necessary distribution method for these products.
It is seen as a cheaper and more efficient way of selling products to a
receptive customer base than through direct sales forces, independent
financial advisers or other routes.
C&amp;G, the sixth-biggest building society by assets, is the first to defy
conventional wisdom and to decide that bancassurance may not be all that
others believe it to be. 'I don't think it can be fruitful long-term for
every player,' said Mr Andrew Longhurst, chief executive of C&amp;G. Only some
banks and building societies would be successful, he added.
For one thing, he said, no bank's customers were likely to be exclusively
its own. 'Each customer may be the customer of several other financial
service companies as well. It is not fair to say 'We have 1m customers who
are sitting ducks for new business' because others will be selling to them
as well.'
Moreover, he said, banks may find that when they begin insurance sales
operations to customers who have never been approached before, they may get
a good response. But successive approaches will find fewer and fewer who do
not already have products they need or who are interested in having them at
all.
Finally, Mr Longhurst said, there is already too much competition in the
industry.
Industry analysts point out that C&amp;G's reputation has been tarnished through
its association with Aylesbury Associates, a group of independent financial
advisers which sold home-income plans mainly to elderly homeowners.
Aylesbury has been suspended from operating by the self-regulatory body
Fimbra.
C&amp;G's role in home-income plans was simply to extend the mortgages, but
along with other building societies it is compensating borrowers for some of
the losses incurred on investments in which mortgage proceeds were placed.
C&amp;G said much of the commission income it earned on sales of insurance
products was eaten up by the costs of selling the products. It calculates
that between a half and two-thirds of the time a sales agent spends with a
customer is devoted to the process of selling the insurance product.
Perhaps more important, C&amp;G has become disenchanted with the staple product
sold through bancassurance outlets - the endowment mortgage. Mr Longhurst
said: 'Endowment mortgages are not automatically in the customer's best
interests.'
Since May 1990 C&amp;G has been reducing the number of endowments it sells with
new mortgages. Only 8.3 per cent of new borrowers is sold one - compared
with an industry average of 69 per cent. The revenues C&amp;G derives from the
sale of insurance products are believed to be less than 1 per cent of
profits.
'The outlook for endowments is not so good,' said Mr Patrick Frazer, of
consultants DIBC and author of Morgan Grenfell's annual report on building
societies. 'C&amp;G looks as if it will be on the side of the angels while the
other building societies find themselves in the position of having to defend
what is increasingly seen as a rip-off product.'
C&amp;G's move allows it to portray itself as sensitive to consumer needs, but
it is also more easily able to divorce itself from bancassurance than the
other societies. Its low cost-to-income ratio means it does not have to
bolster its income through bancassurance, while its commission income from
the sale of insurance-related products is lower than any of the other top
10, according to the analyst UBS.
This low cost ratio has been partially achieved by low overheads. C&amp;G has a
relatively small number of branches - 213, compared with 433 for Leeds
Permanent, the fifth-largest society, and 259 at Bradford &amp; Bingley, the
seventh largest.

FT  13 AUG 93 / Tees and Hartlepool was last years most acrimonious
trust-port privatisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RACHEL JOHNSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TEES and Hartlepool, the UK's second-biggest port, was the first and most
acrimonious of the five trust-port privatisations that took place last year,
Rachel Johnson writes.
Its Pounds 180m sale to Teesside Holdings provoked controversy because it
went neither to its managers and employees nor to the highest bidder.
Mr Charles Lloyd of Price Waterhouse, who advised the government on the sale
of the trust ports, said it was difficult to assess the extent to which
privatisation had been a commercial success.
'The recession has diminished tonnages and it will take several years to see
whether privatisation has had a material impact on performance,' he said.
Teesside Holdings announced pre-tax profits of Pounds 11.3m in the 12 months
to April, but said the profit could not be compared with the previous year's
Pounds 9m because the sale of the port had altered its financial structure.
Turnover was up 10 per cent.
The sale to the private sector has left the port's new owners much freer to
invest in improvements such as warehousing and other dockside facilities.
But last November Teesside lost a valuable contract to import and export
cars for Nissan, the Japanese manufacturer with a Sunderland plant.

THE GOVERNMENT yesterday announced the start of an eight-week consultation
on Nuclear Electric's application for authorisation, under the Radioactive
Substances Act 1960, for radioactive discharges from Sizewell B power
station, Suffolk.
The Department of the Environment said yesterday that nuclear power plants
inevitably made some discharges, but in the UK they must be regulated under
the 1960 act.
Nuclear Electric has completed construction of a pressurised water nuclear
power station at Sizewell B. It is aiming to raise power early next year.
The consultation starts tomorrow.

OFTEL, the telecoms regulator, has invited British Telecommunications and
its competitors to a meeting in early October to discuss future arrangements
for interconnection by competitors to the public telecommunications network.
The day-long private seminar, an unusual departure for a regulator, is to
give BT the chance to spell out its proposals for standard published
interconnection tariffs and to give competitors an opportunity to respond
before Oftel determines the future framework for interconnection.
BT will attend, and about 30 other participants have been invited including
all the main UK telecommunications operators.
Mr Don Cruickshank, Oftel director-general, said he wanted his decision on
inter-connection 'to be firmly founded on the industry's experience and real
needs'.

THE Department of Social Services said yesterday it may have to pay up to
Pounds 67m in retroactive national insurance contribution rebates to
personal pension holders whose applications for tax relief went missing up
to four years ago, Norma Cohen writes.
The DSS said it had reached agreement with the Association of British
Insurers on some 32,000 personal pension plans for which original
applications for tax relief cannot be found.
Under terms of the agreement, ABI member companies could have to pay Pounds
6m to Pounds 7m to clients to bring investment returns into line with what
they would have been had the tax rebates been received on time.

FT  13 AUG 93 / Scientists split over killing off viruses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FAILURE of virologists to reach a decision on what to do with the last
known stocks of smallpox has highlighted the sharply conflicting views of
scientists over whether to destroy such deadly viruses.
An emotional debate at the International Congress on Virology in Glasgow
this week produced no consensus on whether the smallpox stocks, kept deep
frozen in two laboratories in the US and Russia, should be preserved.
A clear-cut verdict by the 1,000 virologists would have given a strong lead
to the World Health Assembly, which is expected to decide the fate of the
virus at the United Nations next year. But no vote was taken at the end of
the evenly balanced debate in Glasgow.
A worldwide vaccination campaign eradicated smallpox in the wild. The last
naturally transmitted case was in Somalia in 1977, though the final smallpox
victim was Mrs Janet Parker, a medical photographer who died in 1978 after
some virus escaped from a Birmingham University laboratory.
Microbiologists agreed after that accident to store all remaining virus
samples in secure laboratories in Atlanta and Moscow.
Dr Brian Mahy, head of virology at the US Centres for Disease Control in
Atlanta, wants to destroy the stocks in his laboratory. This would tell the
world that scientists 'are not afraid to create a safer environment for
future generations', he said in Glasgow. 'Retaining the virus has always
represented the threat of germ and biological warfare.'
His Russian colleague, Dr Dmitri Lvov of the Institute of Virology in
Moscow, agreed. Destruction 'would be a great Christmas gift to all the
world'.
Dr Ken Berns of Yale University, who chaired the debate, said the
destructionists relied mainly on political arguments while their opponents
emphasised the scientific benefits of keeping the virus alive.
The preservationists argue that:
Further research, using new genetic techniques, might shed light on why
smallpox was so dangerous and on why some viruses are more virulent than
others.
The Atlanta and Moscow stocks might not be the only remaining smallpox in
existence. The virus could conceivably survive in bodies buried decades ago
in the Siberian permafrost. There could still be samples in other
laboratories, concealed or just forgotten. Even if smallpox is extinct, a
similar disease might occur if a related animal virus such as monkey pox
mutated into a form that infected humans. The original virus would be a
useful reference for fighting such a new disease.
Humanity has no right to exterminate any living species, whether it is a
panda or a pox.
The fate of smallpox could set a precedent for other organisms that cause
human disease. The World Health Organisation is campaigning to eradicate
polio by the year 2000.
The WHO predicts that the second disease after smallpox to be wiped out  -
perhaps even as soon as 1995 - will be dracunculiasis. It is caused by the
guinea worm, a parasite that would be far more difficult to store
indefinitely in a deep freeze than smallpox or polio virus. Even if smallpox
is reprieved, scientists might be forced to exterminate the guinea worm in
the name of human health.

<TEXT>
ACCOUNTANTS are highly critical of the effectiveness of the new standards
being produced by the Auditing Practices Board, says a survey released
yesterday.
Fewer than half of about 100 auditors questioned believed any of the board's
proposed guidelines were sufficiently precise to form the basis of audit
regulation.
The survey, published in the trade newsletter True &amp; Fair, is one of the
first attempts to assess the work of the board, which was created two years
ago to redraft auditing standards in the UK.

FT  13 AUG 93 / Clinton opens new front with forces: A military leader more
in step with president
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton's relations with the US military establishment
started out on the wrong foot, with controversy over his avoidance of
service in Vietnam. They went rapidly downhill when he became embroiled in
the passionately argued debate over whether homosexuals should be allowed to
serve in the armed forces.
But with the nomination of General John Shalikashvili, Nato's Supreme Allied
Commander in Europe, as next chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, Mr
Clinton has the opportunity to start afresh in a relationship that poses far
more substantial problems, in a period when the armed forces face
simultaneously a large reduction in their size and a sweeping change in
their missions.
The present incumbent, Gen Colin Powell, has turned the joint chiefs
chairmanship, the top post for a US military officer, into such a high
profile position that it is widely assumed he will step quickly into the
political arena, possibly as a candidate for president, or at least for New
York governor. However, no one seems absolutely sure which party he votes
for.
Gen Shalikashvili was born in Poland, so he is constitutionally barred from
moving on to the presidency. But he has already made it clear that he sees a
limit to the responsibilities of his office.
'I have just been nominated for the position of chairman, not president of
the United States,' he remarked this week, laughing off a question on
whether Russia and Ukraine should be brought into Nato.
Now 57, Gen Shalikashvili fled Poland at the age of eight and came to the US
at 16, settling in Peoria, the archetypal midwestern town. He learnt English
from watching John Wayne films, but has not wholly lost his Polish accent.
Although he comes from a military family - his father was a Georgian army
officer and his grandfather a general under the Tsars - he was drafted into
the US army, before taking a commission as an artillery officer.
He served in Vietnam, and took command of Operation Provide Comfort, the
humanitarian operation in Kurdistan that some have seen as a prototype for
new military missions after the end of the cold war.
The first indications are that Gen Shalikashvili will be far more amenable
to some of Mr Clinton's suggestions than Gen Powell has been.
Firmly committed to the 'Base Force' plan prepared under President George
Bush, Gen Powell has appeared to resist the new administration's efforts to
cut the defence budget more quickly.
He has also been downright obstructive to the president's desire to allow
military service by gays - forcing Mr Clinton to accept a compromise that
falls far short of his earlier commitments - and is understood to have been
a voice of caution against military engagement in Bosnia.
Gen Shalikashvili says he finds the new policy on homosexuals quite
acceptable. On Bosnia, however, he seems likely to bring a different point
of view.
He has criticised the US for failing to take the lead at an earlier stage in
the crisis in former Yugoslavia, and has shown himself to be much less
worried than some other military leaders about the prospect that US military
involvement in Bosnia could lead the country into a Vietnam-style quagmire.
'We are not fighting a first rate, fully combat-capable outfit like we have
been preparing for for I don't know how many years. Never underestimate the
mess and the nastiness you get into, but I think we have had too much
overestimating,' he said recently.
This week, Gen Shalikashvili said he hoped it would not prove necessary to
use force in Bosnia, but warned the Serbs not to understimate US readiness
to bomb them should the siege of Sarajevo not be loosened.
From his Saceur experience, however, Gen Shalikashvili is unlikely to accede
to calls for any acceleration in the reduction in US forces. He has voiced
concern about its impact on morale.

</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   CARACAS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
VENEZUELA'S congress has granted President Ramon Velasquez powers until the
end of this year to introduce economic measures by decree. His government, a
transitional administration due to step down in February, asked for special
powers to tackle a series of problems, including the growing fiscal deficit.
The powers will allow the president to introduce:
a sales tax and a tax on the assets of private companies;
reform of the financial system, including opening up banking to foreign
investment;
initiatives to help farmers;
reforms of tax legislation aimed at raising revenues and applying corporate
taxes to private investors in the oil and gas sectors;
a change in the law for selling off the Aeropostal airline.
A joint session of congress also approved a long-awaited privatisation law
reform, aimed at speeding the process.
President Velasquez, who took office on June 5, has said his interim
government will pave the way for a new president, scheduled to be elected in
early December. The new sales and asset taxes will benefit the current
administration only a little but should provide the next government with a
stronger fiscal base.
The administration is facing several economic problems. Revenues from oil
exports, which provide most government income, have fallen because of weak
international oil prices; the government is projecting a fiscal gap of
around Dollars 3.7bn (Pounds 2.5bn) for 1993. Inflation stands at around 36
per cent a year, and economic growth has dropped sharply from last year's
7.3 per cent.

<TEXT>
THE Bank of Canada has abruptly reversed a steep decline in domestic
interest rates to ease downward pressure on the Canadian dollar.
The yield on three-month Treasury bills jumped to 4.65 per cent yesterday
from 3.95 per cent earlier this week. The gap between Canadian and US
short-term rates, which has steadily narrowed over the past three years, has
nearly doubled this week to almost 1.4 percentage points.
The Canadian dollar yesterday sank to 76.15 US cents, its lowest since 1987.
It has lost more than a cent in two days. Pressure has increased as evidence
of an unexpectedly slow economic recovery has led the central bank to
encourage a faster decline in interest rates. It pegged its key bank rate at
3.2 per cent at the weekly setting last Tuesday, the lowest level in 29
years.

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR JAMES BAKER, the former US secretary of state, yesterday became the
latest former Bush administration official to receive a subpoena to testify
in the forthcoming Iraqi loans trial, set to begin in Atlanta next month.
A subpoena was issued to Mr Baker and seven other state department officials
by lawyers for Mr Christopher Drogoul, the former manager of the Atlanta
branch of Italy's Banca Nazionale del Lavoro.
Mr Drogoul is accused of making more than Dollars 5bn of improper loans that
helped to finance Iraq's war machine.
Mr Drogoul, who was allowed to change his plea from guilty to innocent last
year after it emerged that the CIA had withheld vital documents from a
federal judge in Atlanta, has claimed that the Iraqi loans were part of a
covert policy approved by the Reagan and Bush administrations.
Those subpoenaed yesterday include Mr Lawrence Eagleburger, the former
acting secretary of state; former US ambassadors to Baghdad Ms April Glaspie
and Mr David Newton; Mr Abraham Sofaer, the former state department legal
adviser; and Mr Richard Murphy, the former assistant secretary of state. Mr
Robert Simels, lawyer for Mr Drogoul, said Mr Baker and others would be
asked 'to further corroborate US awareness of BNL's role in the finance of
exports to Iraq'.
Mr Simels said he had been notified that the Justice Department had filed a
motion on behalf of former President George Bush to block the subpoena
issued last month calling for him to testify in court.
He added that government lawyers were also seeking to issue their own
subpoena, for notes and tapes of an interview conducted last year with Mr
Drogoul by CBS Television. CBS said yesterday it would not comment until it
had been formally served with the subpoena.

FT  13 AUG 93 / World Trade News: East Asia disputes the road to growth -
Regional conference points up problems of how to co-operate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM KEELING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OPTIMISM that east Asia will lead world economic growth tables into the next
century was palpable at the 'Indonesia, Asia Pacific and the New World
Order' conference in Bali this week. As Mrs Carla Hills, former US trade
representative, said, the region has the potential 'to trigger an economic
renaissance worldwide'.
There was less unanimity, however, about how the region should co-operate to
maximise future growth.
While Chinese delegates pleaded otherwise, most east Asian nations regard
Beijing as a trading competitor, not an ally. Japanese delegates found
themselves isolated by demands that Tokyo improve market access for foreign
goods and companies. There was no accord on arguably the most critical
issue: whether east Asia should proceed alone or forge an Asia-Pacific axis
with the economies of North America.
The conference, which brought together leading Asian politicians, academics
and businessmen, highlighted the recent economic liberalisation and growth
of China, a process which 'is not reversible', according to Prof Edward
Chen, a member of Hong Kong's executive council. China is not unique in east
Asia, with other developing countries such as Thailand and Malaysia
preparing to join South Korea and Taiwan among the ranks of newly
industrialised nations.
Political analysts, however, sounded a note of caution. Prof Robert
Scalapino, a leading Asia academic, warned of the 'awesome problem' of
China's swelling urban population. 'Higher education has fallen into a
terrible state,' he said, and 'the speculative boom in property and stocks
has dangerously depleted bank resources.'
In Indonesia, the world's fourth most populous country, 'social dislocation
will be the major political issue,' said Prof Juwono Sudarsono of the
University of Indonesia. 'Strikes, human rights issues and land issues will
tax the ingenuity of the political leadership'.
Sustained economic growth, most delegates argued, would allow countries to
meet their domestic political challenges. They were less confident that
nations could meet the challenge of economic co-operation. Chinese delegates
called for the development of regional trade associations, but speakers
highlighted east Asia'spoor record in the field.
The most prominent organisation is the six-member Association of South East
Asian Nations (Asean). But, as Mr Anwar Ibrahim, Malaysian finance minister,
noted: 'Asean, despite. . . . booming individual economies, has yet to
achieve something substantial in economic collaboration. 'Should any country
venture to dominate others the (Asean) grouping would collapse immediately,'
he warned.
Delegates said the same concern would preclude the effective development of
wider regional groupings, such as the East Asian Economic Caucus, backed by
Malaysia, or the Asia Pacific Economic Community (Apec), which groups east
Asian nations with the US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.
Although the region is without serious conflict, Prof Paul Evans, director
of the Joint Centre for Asia Pacific Studies in Canada, stressed that
security relations between nations remained a 'significant nightmare'.
Delegates pointed to the continuing tensions in China-Taiwan relations,
Korean unification and contested sovereignty of the Spratly Isles in the
South China Sea as underlining the importance of continued US military
presence in the region. A military role gave muscle to Washington in its
promotion of the wider Apec forum to facilitate US economic involvement in
east Asia.
President Bill Clinton has invited Apec leaders to an informal meeting in
Seattle in November to discuss Asia Pacific issues, but east Asian countries
remain sceptical about US intentions. Malaysia has said that its prime
minister will not attend, and as Prof Scalapino commented: 'The Chinese
leadership cannot avoid the belief that the US is deeply subversive.'
Many delegates believed the US would use Apec to put pressure on Japan to
improve market access in the name of economic co-operation. Through its
trade surplus, 'Japan exports its unemployment to the rest of the world,'
said Prof Fred Bergsten, director of the Institute for International
Economics in the US.
Asian delegates accused the US of interfering in their countries' internal
affairs by linking trade concessions with labour conditions and human
rights. But while most delegates were united in anti-US sentiment they
agreed with Washington that Japan was too protectionist. Any opening up of
Japan's economy would benefit east Asian nations for which it remains the
main export market.
The likely outcome for the Asia Pacific, delegates said, was the formation
of several economic associations, none of which would have any great power.
Few delegates challenged the assertion of Mr Gareth Evans, Australian
foreign minister, that east Asian nations had a 'steady convergence of
aspirations and a growing sense of community'. They also agreed the pace of
change toward economic co-operation would be slow.

FT  13 AUG 93 / World Trade News: Canadians dig in on Nafta sanctions -
Negotiations on pact's labour and environment side-deals reach 'bit of an
impasse'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CANADA'S business community yesterday threw its support behind the Ottawa
government's refusal to include trade sanctions in the side-deals on labour
and the environment being negotiated as part of the North American free
trade agreement.
Disagreement between the US and Mexico on one hand, and Canada on the other,
over the enforcement of labour and environmental standards has thrown a
wrench into the protracted negotiations on the side-deals.
Officials had hoped that the three countries' trade ministers would meet in
Ottawa today to finalise them. Ms Kim Campbell, Canada's prime minister,
said yesterday that 'we have a bit of an impasse with our partners in the
negotiations. . . . There may be a compromise that can be worked out that
could resolve the issue.'
Ms Campbell is expected to discuss the sanctions issue by phone in the next
few days with President Bill Clinton and Mexico's President Carlos Salinas
de Gortari. Conclusion of the negotiations is seen largely as a matter of
political will.
The Clinton administration has promised to conclude the two side-deals
before submitting Nafta to Congress for ratification. It has also insisted
that trade remedies, such as the reintroduction of customs duties, be
included as a penalty against violators of environmental and labour
standards.
The US and Mexico are understood to have agreed on a dispute-settlement
formula which would include various types of sanctions, but with trade
remedies as a last resort.
Mr Thomas d'Aquino, president of the Business Council on National Issues,
which represents the chief executives of Canada's 150 biggest companies,
said yesterday: 'We very strongly applaud the position which the federal
government has taken.'
Damian Fraser adds from Mexico City: While Mexico may have already agreed to
accept trade sanctions for non-compliance with environmental laws as part of
the side-deals, it has firmly rejected apparent US and Canadian pressure for
the right to be able to sue Mexico in Mexican courts.
Sanctions would only occur in the last resort, would be extremely rare, and
would involve tariffs on certain goods returning to their pre-Nafta level,
according to a report in El Financiero newspaper.
A Mexican official said that 'there are very few points' that divide the
three countries, but it was 'not over until it's over'. He suggested the
main problem was a lack of political will in Canada to reach an agreement,
given the concern with its forthcoming general election.
The official confirmed the veracity of a cable obtained by Reuter and sent
out on Wednesday which suggested that Mexico would break off side
negotiations on Nafta if the US and Canada demanded the right to sue Mexico
in its own courts, presumably for not enforcing its environment and labour
laws.
The cable was sent to Mexican negotiators in Washington from the Trade
Ministry. It said that 'the pretension of the US and Canada to include the
possibility of suing Mexico in its own courts attacks the concept of
sovereignty and is as such inadmissible. It is in fact a breaking point.'
Suing the Mexican government in Mexico would almost certainly be futile,
since the courts would be highly unlikely to rule against their own
government in favour of the US even if able to.

Under the agreement Singapore Telecom's commercial arm will distribute
Racal-Datacom's digital, analogue and network management products, and build
networks for its customers based on them.
Racal-Datacom also yesterday opened an office in China, underlining its
determination to advance in Asia-Pacific. The region has the world's fastest
growing telecommunications market and Singapore has one of its most advanced

The Singapore deal is modelled on a similar alliance with British
Telecommunications, estimated to be worth Pounds 40m over three years.
Racal-Datacom has other alliances with US carriers MCI, Bell South and US

Skanska, Scandinavia's largest construction group, has finally secured a

years after first signing a contract for the work, Christopher Brown-Humes
reports from Stockholm.
A group of banks in the Nordic countries, Canada, Venezuela and Colombia are
putting up the funding for the project, which has mainly been hampered by
financing difficulties. Skanska's share of the project is 80 per cent.
The plant, which will have an installed capacity of 340MW and annual
production of 1,420 GWh, is to be built in Cordoba province near the
Caribbean in northern Colombia. Construction work is scheduled to start in
September and take six years.
Skanska will be working alongside the Colombian contracting company
Conciviles on the civil works and will be assisted with services and
purchasing by the Foundation Company of Canada.

ROMAERO, a state-owned Romanian group, has signed a letter of intent with
Boeing, the US aircraft manufacturer, to produce parts for both the Boeing
737 and the new 777 model, a 600-seater, twin-jet aircraft, Romaero said
yesterday, Virginia Marsh writes from Bucharest.
Romaero said the two companies were still discussing what would be produced
in Romania but they hoped to conclude a Dollars 12m (Pounds 8m) contract for
manufacturing parts up to sub-assembly shortly.
Romaero also said it hoped to continue talks with British Aerospace over the
modernisation of the BAC 1-11 jet next month. The company has produced BAC
1-11s under licence since 1982 but the agreement was frozen last month by
BAe due to non-payment of some Dollars 10m in technical assistance and
licensing fees from the Romanians.
Romaero said it was trying to raise financing from US banks on the basis
that it had an order worth Dollars 250m for 11 upgraded BAC 1-11s from Kiwi
International, a new US airline.

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US WHOLESALE prices fell for the second month running in July, indicating
that the sluggish economic recovery is generating little or no upward
pressure on inflation, the Labour Department reported yesterday.
A separate report showed that retail sales increased by a negligible 0.1 per
cent between June and July, less than had been expected in financial markets
and a warning signal that consumer caution could depress economic growth in
the third quarter.
The producer price index for finished goods fell 0.2 per cent last month
after a 0.3 per cent drop in June. The annual rate of wholesale price
inflation fell to 1.3 per cent.
The fall mainly reflected a sharp decline in energy prices, which fell 1 per
cent between June and July, and a slight drop in food prices despite the
flooding in the Midwest. Excluding food and energy, 'core' producer prices
rose 0.2 per cent after a drop of 0.1 per cent in June.
The latest figures strongly suggest that the surge in prices recorded
earlier this year - which prompted the Federal Reserve to threaten higher
interest rates - was an aberration.
The recent sluggish growth of retail sales - the increase in June was
revised down to 0.2 per cent from 0.4 per cent - mainly reflects a drop in
car sales after an exceptionally good month in May. Excluding cars, sales
rose 0.4 per cent last month after a 0.3 per cent gain in June.
Other data have been mixed. Employment figures for July published last week
were encouraging, pointing to a solid gain in industrial production.
But the first estimate of growth in the second quarter - an annual rate of
only 1.6 per cent - was worse than most analysts expected.
Most forecasters continue to predict a rebound in growth in the second half
to an annual rate of 2.5-3 per cent.
Any such growth, however, will depend on whether the signing of President
Bill Clinton's budget this week, by ending a long period of uncertainty
about tax rates, will revive flagging business and consumer confidence.

BRAZIL has allowed the first official gold exports by a private institution

Although Brazilian financial institutions have been permitted to trade in
gold since 1989, only the central bank was able to sell overseas. On Monday
new legislation came into force completely freeing the gold market and
allowing private entities to export gold for the first time.
The first Brazilian company to take advantage of the change was Banco

from garimpeiros, or wildcat miners.
The business community hopes the next step will be to allow the free

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Morihiro Hosokawa, Japan's new prime minister, yesterday called for
international intervention to calm currency markets after the yen closed at
a Tokyo record of Y103.37 to the dollar, up from Y103.77 a day earlier.
The yen's recent surge has prompted concern in the new coalition government
that an already weakened Japanese economy will suffer further damage because
of the sudden fluctuations.
Mr Hosokawa's call follows suggestions in recent months by Finance Ministry
officials that the US should intervene to halt the yen's rise, particularly
as comments by US government officials had sparked an earlier bout of
appreciation.
However, US officials have indicated that, while not in favour of sudden
movements, they believe yen appreciation will assist in cutting Japan's
widening trade surplus.
Mr Hosokawa did not indicate how he expected the international intervention
to be organised. Over the past few years, the Japanese central bank and US
Federal Reserve have intervened on a piece-meal basis to smooth exchange
movements, with mixed success.
Mr Hosokawa emphasised that the value of the yen, which strengthened further
in London, did not reflect the true state of the Japanese economy and
appeared to be the result of speculation.
Since the end of last year, the yen has appreciated by 17 per cent, and Mr
Hosokawa, who took office on Monday, has faced calls for action from
Japanese business leaders, who had expected that the yen would weaken this
month.
The strengthening, which has come in spite of daily intervention this week
by the Bank of Japan, is putting extreme pressure on export-oriented
manufacturers.
While the negative effects of the yen's movement have been quickly felt by
Japanese companies, a consumer survey by the Economic Planning Agency has
found that only 43.9 per cent of respondents say the currency's appreciation
has led to lower prices for imports.

SOUTH Africa's economy grew by 5.1 per cent in the second quarter, according

ended.
The improvement compares with growth of 1.4 per cent in the first quarter.
The news coincides with publication of data suggesting government finances
are in reasonable shape after speculation the government would overshoot its
deficit target.
Most of the growth is attributable to the agricultural sector, which is

FT  13 AUG 93 / S Korea bans false-name dealings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SEOUL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SOUTH KOREA'S President Kim Young-sam, in a surprise announcement, last
night ordered immediate implementation of a key financial reform to reduce
the large underground economy.
Mr Kim invoked emergency powers to introduce a real-name financial
transaction system, which bans the use of false or borrowed names in
financial dealings.
Although action could have an adverse short-term impact on the already weak
Korean economy - by prompting a fall in the stock market through the sale of
shares held under false names - many analysts welcomed the move.
'This signifies that the new government is committed to economic
deregulation and financial liberalisation,' said Mr Andrew Holland, head of
research at BZW in Seoul.
Mr Kim described the real- name system as 'the most important reform for the
construction of a new Korea' because 'it would stamp out corruption'.
An estimated Won3,000bn (Pounds 2.48bn) is held in false-name accounts.
Those holding assets under false names will have two months to deposit them
into real-name accounts, which would then be subject to taxation. Those
failing to do so will be subject to tax investigations and penalties.
Shares held under false or nominee names account for about 7 per cent of
stock investor accounts.
In an attempt to persuade these investors to keep their money in the bourse,
Mr Kim promised not to impose a capital gains tax on stock investment during
his term, which ends in 1997.
The government will also call on institutional investors to buy shares if
panic selling seizes the bourse. But some analysts predict that may not be
necessary.
'The initial market reaction may be negative, but that will likely subside
quickly as investors begin to understand the positive aspects of the
real-name system on the stock market and the economy,' said Mr Edward Kim of
Korea Development Securities.
There is concern, however, there could be an immediate squeeze on short-term
funds as some institutional investors, such as securities houses, borrow
money to buy stock under government direction.
The government is also taking measures to prevent the flight of capital
abroad or attempts to switch hidden assets from bank and stock accounts into
property. This includes requiring those engaged in financial transactions to
provide identification proving asset ownership.

THE Palestine Liberation Organisation yesterday rejected the resignations of
three Palestinian peace negotiators from the Israeli-occupied territories.
It also said, in a concession to the three who were upset about a lack of
consultation by the PLO, that they would be included with four fellow
negotiators in a PLO leadership committee directing peace talks with Israel.
The move came after Palestinian officials in Tunis said the PLO had come
under pressure from Arab governments, including Saudi Arabia, to resolve the
issue quickly and not let the three negotiators, the more moderate members
of the team, resign.
The US and Russia, co-sponsors of Arab-Israeli peace talks, also said
yesterday they had invited all sides to resume negotiations in Washington at
the end of this month.
Arriving in Amman in transit, Mr Husseini said: 'It was a serious matter,
but in the end it was in the same house between the same people and we
reached together a new conclusion which can really serve our interest.'
The appointments of seven Palestinian negotiators to the PLO leadership
committee marks the first time members of the Palestinian team from inside
the territories have been given official PLO posts and will further test
Israeli's ban on direct talks with the PLO.
Palestinian participants in the talks said Mr Yassir Arafat, PLO chairman,
had successfully exploited the resignation threat by postponing a final
decision for several days. They said his almost single purpose was to force
Israel to realise it must open a direct dialogue with the PLO to make
progress in peace talks.
By letting the resignation threat drag on, Mr Arafat faced Israeli
politicians with the prospect of a Palestinian peace team stripped of its
moderates and led by hardliners such as Mr Haidar Abdel-Shafi.

FT  13 AUG 93 / India's new airlines seek wider horizons: A campaign for
swifter liberalisation of the skies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SHIRAZ SIDHVA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FREQUENT flyers on Indian Airlines, India's state-owned domestic carrier,
were pleasantly surprised last week when they took the evening flight from
Delhi to Bombay. Suddenly, checking in was no longer a nightmare. Ground
staff were efficient. Most important, the flight took off on time.
Passengers - all with their own Indian Airlines horror story to narrate -
were astonished when a smiling flight attendant laid out a crisp tablecloth
before serving a stylish Indian meal with bread and fruit.
'See what competition has achieved,' said one passenger, Mr Kantikumar
Podar, a Bombay businessman and president of the Federation of Indian
Chambers of Commerce and Industry. 'There is a tremendous change in attitude
and service. For the first time, it's a pleasure to fly Indian Airlines.'
The introduction of the government's open skies policy two years ago has
given domestic travellers a choice. Four private airlines - Jet Airways,
East West Airlines, Damania Airways and Modiluft - operate on lucrative
routes such as Bombay-Delhi and Bombay-Bangalore. Passengers may now walk
into the main airports and buy a ticket an hour before a flight. Delays and
overbooked flights may be things of the past.
For the first time, the 40-year-old state airline is facing competition in a
market the new operators believe it has long taken for granted.
Passengers are attracted to the new airlines by punctuality as well as free
alcohol and attentive service. Passengers flying Damania received individual
thank-you letters from the managing director. A couple who complained about
service on Modiluft were sent roses and a handwritten apology note.
However, despite the new airlines' efforts to make liberalisation work, the
cards are stacked against them. The new airlines, which the government
prefers to call private air taxi operators, face operational constraints as
well as battles with a bureaucracy which, they say, tries to impede
liberalisation.
'The government has granted us the permission to operate, but it is
constantly safeguarding the interests of Indian Airlines at our expense,'
says the head of one airline. 'The taxpayer is actually subsidising the
inefficiencies of Indian Airlines, at a great cost to our economy and
foreign exchange reserves.' Indian Airlines made a loss of Rs2.11bn (Pounds
44.8m) last year.
Last week, the four airlines formed the Air Taxi Operators' Committee to
urge the government to speed passage of a parliamentary bill to repeal the
Air Corporation Act 1953, which prevents the formal legalisation of private
carriers and grants protection to Indian Airlines as a departmental
undertaking of central government. The bill is now before parliament.
The committee's demands include a clear-cut aviation policy with guidelines
for air taxi operators.
'We are still termed non-scheduled operators, though we operate to
schedules. Not being able to advertise and publish schedules poses a major
marketing problem, especially abroad,' says Mr Naresh Goyal, owner of Jet
Airways, which has inter-line agreements co-ordinating flights with
international carriers including British Airways.
The committee has urged the director general of Civil Aviation to withdraw a
directive that private operators should operate an equal number of flights
on routes of less than 700km and on those of more than that distance. 'We
are not charity organisations and this stipulation would mean that we would
lose the flexibility of optimally deploying our limited resources,' says one
operator.
A further constraint is that private airlines are not allowed the best
facilities at Bombay and Delhi airports. They share limited counter space in
old, shabby terminals. New terminals are reserved for Indian Airlines'
Airbus flights to leading cities. 'The airports could benefit from rents if
the unused counters and space at the new terminals were allotted to private
operators,' the committee said.
The committee has asked for a revision of airport and air traffic control
timings, which are tailored to suit Indian Airlines' operations.
It has also requested adequate hangar space at airports. In the absence of
any co-operation from Indian Airlines, private operators' aircraft have to
go abroad to be serviced and even to have mandatory monthly checks. Spares
and equipment have to be imported, which makes them more costly.
The private airlines' battle for equal treatment is likely to be a hard one.
If the parliamentary bill is passed, Indian Airlines may be unable to
continue flights on loss-making routes which would otherwise not be
connected by air.
'Indian Airlines has a social commitment to the country that the private
operators don't need to worry about,' says an Indian Airlines spokesman.
'None of the private airlines can match our infrastructure, and if it hadn't
been for subsidies, how could we offer the lowest fares in the world?'
However, the private operators say that India's domestic air traffic has
been stifled by Indian Airlines, and could grow substantially. 'During its
best year, IA catered to a volume of 10m passengers, but aviation experts
say that the total market size could increase to 25m passengers,' according
to Mr Goyal.
Mr Thakiyudeen Wahid, managing director of East West Airlines, says: 'East
West has shown that with maximum utilisation, we can fly 8,000 passengers
per day with 11 Boeing aircraft, compared with IA's 22,000 with a fleet of
53, including 24 Airbus A-320s and 11 Airbus A-300s.'
Mr Parvez Damania, the 33-year old poultry farmer who started Damania
Airways, says: 'Indian Airlines and the airport authorities could provide us
the engineering support, make their under-utilised infrastructure reap
profits, and save considerable foreign exchange.'
He says: 'The attitude towards us is not right. We could work together with
Indian Airlines to greatly expand the market. And Indian Airlines would be
the first to benefit.'

<TEXT>
Jet Airways: Started by Jetair Private, a leading airline sales agent and
travel agency, in May 1993, the airline operates a fleet of four Boeing
737-300s to 12 destinations, including four in south India. Linked with the
SABRE worldwide reservations system, with inter-line co-ordination
arrangements with 12 leading international airlines. Engineering back-up is
provided by Australia's Ansett company. Initial investment was Dollars 20m,
with a projected turnover of Rs2.40bn in the first year. Four aircraft are
to be added to its fleet by end-1993.
East West Airlines: India's first private airline, started in February 1992,
with an initial investment of Rs1bn, and a turnover of Rs5bn. The airline
flies eight Boeing 737s and three Fokker-27s to 25 destinations, and is
linked on to the Gabriel 2 global reservations system. Technical
collaboration from Ireland's Aer Lingus, staff of 3000.
Damania Airways: This Rs260m project started operations in March 1993, and
has 16 flights a day to six destinations. A Beechcraft 99 used exclusively
on the short-haul Bombay-Pune sector, and Boeing 737-200s dry-leased from
Air Portugal, make up the fleet, which will expand to five aircraft in the
current year, and 10 by the end of next year. Modiluft: Modiluft is leasing
two Boeing 737-200 aircraft from Lufthansa, the German carrier. It has used
the familiar yellow and blue international colours that Lufthansa uses, with
light-blue boarding passes, and even a slightly modified bird logo of the
airline.

FT  13 AUG 93 / China closes down 1,000 local development zones
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THE Chinese government, stepping up its drive to stop wasteful spending and
curb the country's overheated growth rate, yesterday announced the closure
of most economic development zones established by local governments to
attract investment.
Xinhua, the official news agency, said 1,000 zones in southern coastal areas
had been shut down, and the remaining 200 were being inspected with a view
to further closures.
The measure will have no effect on special economic zones authorised by the
central government to promote economic reform and growth, such as Shenzhen,
just across the border from Hong Kong.
The zones being closed were set up by local officials who were attracted by
real estate profits and offered tax breaks and other unauthorised incentives
to match the attractions of authorised investment areas.
Mr Hu Ping, director of the Special Economic Zone Office, said the State
Council, China's cabinet, had approved only 30 economic and technological
development zones in the coastal areas.
He said only 10 per cent of the unauthorised zones had been beneficial for
the local economy. One-fifth were waiting for money to start planned
projects. They tied up scarce farmland, slowing agricultural production, he
added.
'The objective is to stop land which has little prospect of development in
the near future from being cordoned off when it could be used for crop
growing,' Mr Hu said.
Profligate spending and corruption among local officials are particular
targets of the campaign of Mr Zhu Rongji, vice premier and central bank
governor, to curb money supply and inflationary growth.
According to China Focus, a publication of the Princeton China Initiative in
the US, Mr Zhu recently criticised officials in Guangxi province, in
south-west China, who had ploughed over and fenced off 15,000 square
kilometres of farmland of which 1 per cent had so far been taken up by
construction.
Calculating that developing the land would cost the entire national
development budget for six years, Mr Zhu is reported to have asked them:
'Just let me know where the money is coming from. . . What is the rest of
the nation to do meanwhile?'
Xinhua yesterday said officials in Beihai city, Guangxi province, had
approved dozens of questionable property schemes, including casinos.
China's trade deficit was Dollars 4.62bn in the first seven months of 1993,
although trade officials are confident the current austerity measures will
help achieve a surplus for 1992 by the year-end. Exports were up 4.7 per
cent to Dollars 44.78bn over the same period of last year, and imports up
25.7 per cent to Dollars 49.4bn.

FT  13 AUG 93 / Yamahana offers to quit SDP post: Call for party leadership
ballot
</HEADLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE SOCIAL Democratic party, the biggest member of Japan's new seven-party
ruling coalition, yesterday entered a potentially divisive period of
soul-searching when Mr Sadao Yamahana offered to resign as leader.
Mr Yamahana, who will retain his job as minister in charge of political
reform in the cabinet formed on Monday, called for an open ballot of party
members. He said he would be a candidate but was submitting to a contest in
the wake of the SDP's poor showing in the general election last month.
Although that brought the party to power for the first time since the late
1940s, the SDP's parliamentary strength was almost halved.
In the year the coalition expects to be in power before holding fresh
elections under a new system, the left-wing SDP, whose support it needs, is
thought likely to be the main stumbling block in establishing policies apart
from those on the political reform agenda.
'I feel indebted to my comrades who failed to win Diet seats,' Mr Yamahana
told party officials in his resignation statement. However, no other
contender for the job immediately emerged. Mr Yamahana from the moderate
wing of the party, the most left-wing member of the coalition, became
chairman only in January. Many SDP activists are uncomfortable at the
alliance he has since formed with conservatives and centrists.
He described his move as aimed at rebuilding the party, but its executive
committee was unable to reach a decision yesterday on how to proceed, with
some party bosses trying to persuade Mr Yamahana to change his mind.
Mr Yamahana and Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, prime minister and leader of the
year-old Japan New party, have committed themselves to enacting political
reform measures by the end of the year. Coalition leaders yesterday made
little progress towards agreement on the form of electoral system to replace
the current multi-seat constituencies. As these have meant members of the
same party competing, fundraising ability often wins out, fostering
corruption.
The pursuit of alleged misdeeds from the old order continued yesterday with
the indictment of Mr Fujio Takeuchi on charges of taking Y55m (Pounds
348,100) in bribes from Hazama, a construction company, while governor of
Ibaraki prefecture north-east of Tokyo. Also charged was Mr Shigeru Honda,
who stepped down as Hazama chairman after an indictment in a case involving
the mayor of Sendai to the north.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A STAY-AWAY called to demand the end of military rule in Nigeria brought
Lagos to a halt yesterday, but failed to win backing outside the south-west
of the country.
For the second time since President Ibrahim Babangida annulled the June 12
presidential poll, the country's commercial capital was forced to shut down.
But the organisers of a three-day campaign of protest won little or no
backing outside the Yoruba-speaking south-west, stronghold of Mr Moshood
Abiola, the successful candidate in the June election.
Life continued as normal in the important northern cities of Kaduna, Kano
and the capital, Abuja, according to residents.
Earlier protests in July crippled Lagos for three days, and around 100
people were killed when gangs took advantage of demonstrations to loot and
troops were ordered in. Yesterday the streets of Lagos and Ibadan, the
country's second largest city, were deserted and no violent incidents were
reported.
The objective of the campaign is to bring economic pressure on the
government, which, say opposition officials, will find it difficult to
control Nigeria if 23m Yorubas who dominate the economic heart of the
country oppose it.
The Campaign for Democracy has denounced the proposed interim government and
believes that the next government should be headed by Mr Abiola. Mr Olisa
Agbakoba, spokesman for the Campaign for Democracy, said he was disappointed
that the protest had received little backing in the north and east but said
he hoped that links with the labour movement and with local leaders of the
SDP who oppose the interim government would make future action more
effective.
The Nigerian Labour Congress has said that it would consider concerted
action if the military are still in power on August 27, although the
50,000-strong oil workers' union is threatening to strike unilaterally.
Should they take such action, the government would then be under severe
pressure, with oil exports accounting for over 90 per cent of export
earnings. The US government has suspended direct air links with Nigeria,
about five flights a week, because of long-standing security issues at Lagos
airport.

FT  13 AUG 93 / Paris moves warily on interest rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SMALL step by small step, France is charting a course for monetary policy,
following the European currency crisis which left the French franc hovering
uncertainly in a weakened exchange rate mechanism.
The Bank of France has this week trimmed overnight interest rates by a
meagre 0.75 percentage points from their crisis levels of 10 per cent. The
rates for 5 to 10 day loans for commercial banks have been left unchanged.
'It seems they have decided on a general policy,' says Ms Marie-Owens
Thomson, International economist at Midland Global Markets. 'They are going
to bring down interest rates, but gradually.'
But why are the French financial authorities moving so gingerly when the
high level of interest rates in France's recession-hit economy was one of
the principal causes of the assaults on the French franc last month?
For Mr Edouard Balladur, French prime minister, the most important reason
for caution is his continued attachment to a strong franc policy despite the
widening of the currency's fluctuation bands within the European exchange
rate mechanism from 2.25 per cent to 15 per cent. The Franc has fallen by
about 2.5 per cent below its old ERM floor rate of FFr3.4305 to the D-Mark,
and Mr Balladur is anxious to avoid a larger fall by rapid moves on
borrowing costs.
Politically, a rapid cut in interest rates could accelerate the depreciation
of the franc and undermine Mr Balladur's credibility as an advocate of the
'franc fort' policy. It would also give legitimacy to political opponents,
even within his Gaullist RPR party, who have advocated more expansionist
economic policies. These include Mr Philippe Seguin, president of the
National Assembly, who has called for devaluation and more protectionist
policies.
Practically, a strong franc is needed to help rebuild foreign exchange
reserves at the Bank of France. Figures it published yesterday confirmed
that a deficit of almost FFr200bn (Pounds 22.8bn) was incurred in the
unsuccessful defence of the franc last month.
In addition the franc/D-Mark link, although now greatly weakened, is
regarded as the symbol of bilateral co-operation in the process of European
union. France may also not want to cut rates faster than other ERM members
to avoid the impression of competitive devaluations.
The problem for Mr Balladur is how to reconcile currency stability with the
need to revive the economy and curb unemployment, forecast to reach 12.5 per
cent of the population by the end of the year.
The French authorities have some room for manoeuvre. Figures published
yesterday which confirmed an annual inflation rate of just over 2 per cent
suggest there is little immediate danger in currency depreciation. More
important, the fact that the franc has been relatively stable since the
half-point cut in the overnight rate suggests that the central bank may also
be able to bring rates down further without unsettling the foreign exchange
markets.
'Short-term interest rates could return relatively quickly to pre-crisis
levels of about 7 per cent, possibly within the next 4-6 weeks,' says Mr
Jean-Francois Mercier, economist at Salomon Brothers in London. Overnight
rates are likely to be used as a stalking horse for cuts in other rates,
particularly the 5-10 day borrowing rate and ultimately the intervention
rate, which stands at 6.75 per cent and which acts as a floor on money
market rates.
The gamble for the French authorities is whether they can cut rates fast
enough to satisfy domestic pressures for economic recovery.
However, in the international currency markets, the situation is more
delicate. 'They are on a tightrope,' says one Paris-based diplomat. 'If they
don't deliver rate cuts fast enough, then investor confidence in the franc
will be eroded and the currency will come under attack again.'
Mr Balladur will be encouraged by the resilience of the franc after this
week's rate cuts. But with the strength of the D-Mark expected to persist as
EC central banks pay back their loans to the Bundesbank, the situation
remains fragile. Despite the attractions of stepping up the pace of rate
cuts, the French are likely to continue to tread carefully.

FT  13 AUG 93 / Greece clears the path for telecoms sale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER and KERIN HOPE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ATHENS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Greek parliament yesterday passed a controversial bill clearing the way
for the partial sale of OTE, the state-owned telecoms monopoly, the
government's most ambitious privatisation project, Reuter reports from
Athens.
The bill was approved by 51 votes to 47 after weeks of strife within the
ruling conservative party and a storm of protest from opposition parties and
trade unions.
The government has a single-seat majority in parliament and National Economy
Minister Stephanos Manos was forced to make last-minute changes in the bill
to persuade dissidents in the conservative camp not to vote it down.
The bill allows the sale of 35 per cent of OTE's shares and its management
to an international operator. Another 10 per cent will be floated on the
Athens bourse and 4 per cent will be offered free to company employees and
pensioners. The state will control the remaining 51 per cent.
Objections focused mainly on the decision to grant management rights to a
core investor. The opposition Socialist party accused the government of
selling off national wealth.
To soften opposition within his own ranks, Prime Minister Constantine
Mitsotakis had said the government would control telephone charges and the
state will hold a 6-5 majority on OTE's board of directors. Mr Manos went
further yesterday, giving the board more power to decide major policy.
The General Confederation of Greek Workers, the country's biggest union with
almost 1m members, held a 24-hour strike yesterday protesting against OTE's
sale.
The strike closed public banks and offices and created problems in
transport, telecommunications, the power supply and the mail.
Six international companies have expressed interest in winning the
management stake in OTE. They are Japan's NTT, France Telecom, American GTE,
Spanish Telefonica, Italy's Stet and Korea Telecom.
Kerin Hope in Athens adds: The quality of OTE's international service has
deteriorated recently as the union representing OTE workers stepped up its
campaign against the proposed sale.
Given the scope for improvement in Greek telecommunications, it is hard to
see why anyone should oppose the introduction of new management. The
government says the foreign buyer would undertake to invest at least Dollars
7bn (Pounds 4.75bn) in the network over the next decade.
According to an EC-funded study carried out by consultants from Coopers and
Lybrand, the international accountants, OTE's current policy of piecemeal
replacement of switching and transmission equipment is 'gradually killing'
the country's overloaded telephone system.
With more than 800,000 applications for telephone lines outstanding, a

<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Boris Yeltsin yesterday vowed to hold new parliamentary elections
in the autumn, even if this meant violating the constitution, in a bid to
break the deadlock over political and economic reform.
Under the existing Soviet-era constitution which Mr Yeltsin wants to
replace, parliament cannot be dissolved until it completes its present term
in 1995, or unless the Congress of People's Deputies, the full parliament,
amends the constitution accordingly.
'If deputies cannot take the decision, the president will take it for them,'
he told a meeting of provincial television executives in Moscow.
Any decision to pursue new elections without parliament's consent would be
unconstitutional. But Mr Yeltsin and his supporters increasingly feel the
benefits of doing so would outweigh the risks. One aide suggested that the
most painless way of removing the parliament would be to issue a
presidential decree calling new elections after a quick plebiscite to show
public support for the idea.
Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, chairman of the parliament, dismissed Mr Yeltsin's
statement as a groundless threat.
'There are threats which send shivers down people's spines,' Mr Khasbulatov
said in a live television broadcast billed as an address to the people of
Russia yesterday. 'In these conditions, do not be alarmed, we will protect
you using the force of laws and the constitution.'
Mr Vladimir Isakov, parliamentary vice-chairman, said any bid to bypass
parliament on elections would be Mr Yeltsin's 'swan song'.
'Yet again he is ignoring the will of the people and taking the path of a
coup d'etat,' he told Postfactum news agency.
Despite being elected under the old Soviet regime and resisting radical
reforms, most deputies claim to be defending democracy, while trying to hang
on to their seats.
Mr Yeltsin, fearful of creating a precedent for unconstitutional acts, has
so far sought to pressure parliament into dissolving itself to make way for
a new parliament more suited to a nascent, post-communist market economy.
As he spoke yesterday, the Supreme Soviet, or standing parliament, also
raised the heat in the fight with the president. It adopted a draft law
which, if approved by a Congress session now scheduled for November, would
give it ultimate decision-making on the government's composition.
Last month, it attempted to block the mass privatisation programme and
passed a budget with a huge deficit, which Mr Yeltsin said yesterday was
designed to destroy Russia's financial system. Continuing a counter-attack
on economic policy, he announced he had instructed the government to stick
to the budget rejected by parliament.
'Under no circumstances will I sign this budget law,' he said.
'If implemented it would mean the collapse of the Russian currency system,
the destruction of the rouble and the undermining of Russian statehood.'

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NEW laws to accelerate privatisation by Germany's 16 state governments, and
local authorities, were promised yesterday by Mr Gunter Rexrodt, economics
minister.
He criticised sharply the growth of creeping public ownership through the
powerful state banks, singling out especially WestLB, the public sector bank
in North Rhine-Westphalia.
Clearly intending to step up public pressure for more privatisation at state
and local government level, he warned that he would introduce 'instruments
of torture' to get the process moving. The spread of public ownership
through state banks was in complete contradiction to the federal
government's privatisation policies.
Mr Rexrodt was not precise on the measures he intends, but said his ministry
was working on the legislation. He proposed legal budgetary 'guidelines' as
one measure, and compelling all public authorities to investigate private
solutions to tasks currently conducted by publicly-owned bodies.
His attack on North Rhine-Westphalia, and WestLB in particular, will
certainly be warmly greeted by the private banking sector, which has been
very critical of the growth of the state banks.
WestLB is 43 per cent owned by the state government. Mr Rexrodt listed
shareholdings of more than 10 per cent in nine separate public companies,
including Preussag (32 per cent), the Horten retail chain (26 per cent) and
VEW, the electricity generator (11 per cent), with a total value of more
than DM3bn (Pounds 1.2bn).
The bank also has unlisted shareholdings in the travel groups LTU, TUI and
Thomas Cook, and other companies.
He also called for Germany's powerful savings banks to be privatised 'as far
as possible', in order to remove competition distortions in banking.
As far as the federal government was concerned, he said, early privatisation
of Deutsche Telekom, the state telecommunications concern, had top priority.
Plans for selling off service areas, such as airports and ports, should be
accelerated.

FT  13 AUG 93 / Ford may reshuffle German posts as cost pressures mount
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FORD-WERKE, the German subsidiary of the US motor group, yesterday refused
to comment on reports that its American-born chairman is to be replaced by a
German, writes Christopher Parkes.
Mr John Hardiman, head of Ford-Werke for five years, is to return to the US
and his post will be filled by Mr Albert Caspers, according to the industry
newsletter, PS Report.
Mr Caspers, currently vice-president responsible for engineering and
manufacturing at Ford Europe, will shortly be joined in the German
subsidiary's headquarters by Mr Heinz Soiron, Ford's general manager in
Spain, the newsletter added.
The reshuffle did not indicate that there was any dissatisfaction with Mr
Hardiman, 59, who has worked in Europe for Ford for more than 30 years, PS
Report suggested.
It was prompted more by the need, detected by Mr Jacques Nasser, the new
chief at Ford Europe, for a technical leader to oversee sharp cost
reductions in line with those under way throughout the German motor
industry.
Mr Caspers has been in charge of all 24 Ford plants in Europe since 1989.
Mr Soiron, recognised as a high-flier in Ford Europe, is expected to be
appointed as sales director and Mr Caspers' deputy.
Mr Roger Leite, current sales chief of Ford-Werke, is expected to be
appointed northern group director of Ford Europe, the newsletter said.
Mr Hardiman would 'probably' return to the US.

FT  13 AUG 93 / French reserves hit by currency crisis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING, ANDREW FISHER and JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS, FRANKFURT,, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bank of France has been left with a substantial net deficit in its
foreign currency reserves as a result of its attempts to bolster the franc
in the recent European currency crisis.
German foreign currency reserves, meanwhile, have shown a sharp increase.
In Paris, figures issued yesterday by the Bank of France showed that the
country's net reserves fell by almost FFr190bn (Pounds 21.64bn) in the week
to August 5, leaving the central bank with a deficit of more than FFr180bn
in its foreign exchange holdings.
The drain on French reserves will have been due almost entirely to the
central bank's intervention in the currency markets to try to keep the franc
above its former ERM floor against the D-Mark.
On July 29 alone, economists estimate the central bank spent more than the
FFr160bn used to defend the franc in its previous crises in January this
year and September 1992. The total amount of reserves used by the French
authorities in the recent crisis is estimated at more than FFr305bn.
The reserves data helped to explain France's cautious approach to reducing
interest rates since the widening of fluctuation bands within the currency
system on August 2.
Economists said that if the French authorities were to lower interest rates,
the currency could fall against the D-Mark - but the central bank would have
no reserves with which to support the exchange rate through currency
intervention.
In Frankfurt, figures issued yesterday showed Germany's foreign exchange
reserves rose by DM39.3bn (Pounds 15.5bn) in the last week of July as a
result of the currency turbulence preceding the decision to widen currency
bands in the ERM and thus avert speculative pressures.
The Bundesbank said in its weekly statement that the reserve total was now
DM157.9bn.
The sharp rise, caused by Bundesbank intervention to support currencies
under pressure - predominantly the franc - only showed up in the figures for
the week to August 7 because foreign exchange transactions are reported with
a week's delay.
Mr Helmut Schlesinger, Bundesbank president, has said some DM60bn flowed
into Germany in July as a result of intervention in the ERM.
The franc slipped against the D-Mark yesterday after the central bank
figures were issued. It closed yesterday at FFr3.514 against the D-Mark,
about a third of a centime down on the day. But at one stage, the currency
was being bought at FFr3.52.
The Danish krone also fell sharply against the D-Mark amid signs that
Denmark needed to replenish its foreign exchange reserves after the crisis
in the European exchange rate mechanism.

FT  13 AUG 93 / Treuhand coal deal faces late challenge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BERLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Anglo-American utilities consortium which is negotiating the purchase of
Mibrag, one of eastern Germany's giant brown coal fields, is facing a late
challenge by the company's management.
The consortium, led by Britain's PowerGen, and the Minneapolis-based NRG,
wants to use Mibrag to establish a foothold in eastern Germany's highly
regulated utilities sector.
The consortium has sole negotiating rights with the Treuhand, the agency
charged with privatising eastern German industry, and which owns Mibrag.
These rights were extended from July 31, until later this month.
The negotiations are focusing on the price of the mines and other Mibrag
divisions. A consortium negotiator yesterday said that a valuation of Migrab
done for the Treuhand was 'wildly over-estimated', and inflated capital
costs have been built into the valuation.
The consortium is expected to invest at least DM650m in Mibrag, depending on
the assets they actually purchase.
The dispute over the sale price coincides with moves by Mibrag's board to
set up a 'kind of management buy-out', according to Mr Willi Wessel, a board
member. He said that under the proposal ownership would remain with the
Treuhand until Mibrag was restructured. He added that this option would slow
the pace of job losses as well as effectively postpone Mibrag's
privatisation until 1996.
The final price of Mibrag could influence the price of Laubag, the other
lignite field which the Treuhand is also trying to privatise, a factor which
explains in part the Treuhand's increasingly tough negotiating position with
the consortium.
But under pressure from Bonn, it is also anxious to sell Mibrag to the
Anglo-Americans as a means of introducing competition into the region's
energy sector.
Some observers believe the proposed management buyout may be a way of
putting pressure on the consortium to buy Mibrag at an inflated price. But
utility experts said it was also an attempt by some members of the Mibrag
management to keep out the Anglo-Americans in order to keep out competition
and to maintain the high cost structure of the industry.
Mr Wessel repeated this week that the management buy-out option was
'serious'. The move has already been discussed with Mr Klaus Murmann, head
of Germany's federation of employers, a board member of Mibrag. 'We want to
privatise but at the same time save jobs' said Mr Frank Wienke, a senior
official at the federation.

To offset the impact on money supply growth and inflation, it cut sharply
the weekly allocation of securities repurchase agreements (repos) in the
first week of August.
The rise in Bundesbank foreign exchange reserves the previous week was
DM7.7bn, also reflecting ERM intervention.

The bank also has unlisted shareholdings in the travel groups LTU, TUI and

'The purchase of shareholdings. . . in commercial enterprises through a

'This is diametrically opposed to the privatisation policy of the federal
government.'
He also called for Germany's powerful savings banks to be privatised 'as far

As far as the federal government is concerned, he said that top priority was

privatising service areas, such as airports and ports.
As a result of draft legislation approved by the German cabinet this week,
the monopoly of the Federal Labour Office on job placements will be lifted,
allowing private sector competition.
Mr Rexrodt said that a principle of privatisation should be full national
and international competition and tendering, to ensure the widest possible
competition.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE CENTRAL banks of Sweden and Finland yesterday cut interest rates to help
stimulate a revival of their recession-hit economies.
The Bank of Finland cut its base rate by half a percentage point to 6 per
cent, its lowest level for nearly 40 years.
Sweden's central bank, the Riksbank, cut its key marginal rate from 8.25 per
cent to 8 per cent, continuing a pattern of reductions which began after the
country floated its currency last November.
Sweden and Finland are expecting their economies to shrink for the third
consecutive year in 1993, and badly need lower interest rates to spur
recovery and cut unemployment. Both countries are hoping for positive growth
next year on the back of higher exports.
Sweden's long-term and short-term interest rates are at their lowest levels
since the 1970s. Mr Thomas Franzen, Riksbank deputy governor, said the bank
had decided to cut its marginal rate for the second time in a week because
of the 'significant fall' in long-term interest rates and because financial
markets had responded well to previous cuts. He noted that the Swedish krona
had strengthened in recent weeks following a sharp depreciation earlier in
the year.

   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE BANK of Spain and one of the country's biggest commercial banks said
yesterday they believed Spain's recession was easing. They predict that the
decline in gross domestic product will slow slightly in the second half of
the year, indicating the economic downturn may have bottomed out.
The Spanish central bank says in its latest economic bulletin it expects GDP
to fall by 1 per cent in the second half, compared with the official 1.1 per
cent fall in the first half.
Banco Central Hispano (BCH) said the slide in GDP had stabilised at minus
1.1 per cent since March, which it took as a sign that 'the fall in economic
activity may have touched bottom.' BCH said the brake in recession was
because of strong growth in exports following three peseta devaluations
since last autumn, and a sharp fall in imports as internal demand has
withered.
BCH said it expected a further slowdown of the fall in output although both
it and the Bank of Spain insisted that any stop to job losses would also
depend heavily on the success of current efforts by the government to agree
a three-year incomes policy, with the unions agreeing to freeze wages next
year and employers promising to freeze dividend payments at their present
levels. The unions argue strongly against a wage freeze.
Spain's economic planners blame high wage growth for the country's inability
to hold inflation down and the central bank said it was 'worried' about the
growth of prices and wages in the first half of the year. It said further
interest rate cuts would depend on the success of wages talks and the fiscal
discipline shown in the 1994 budget.

FT  13 AUG 93 / French consumer prices see small July increase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
French consumer prices increased slightly in July, rising by between 0.1 per
cent and 0.2 per cent above the level in June, according to figures released
yesterday by Insee, the national statistics office, writes John Ridding.
The figures, which give an annual rate of inflation of between 2.1 per cent
and 2.2 per cent, were welcomed by the economics ministry, which said they
confirmed the 'strong state of French competitiveness.' A spokesman for the
ministry said they would support the French franc in the medium term.
Economists in Paris said that the figures were at the lower end of forecasts
and that the rise reflected the impact of indirect taxes and a relatively
strong rise in the cost of services.
Petrol taxes were increased at the beginning of July, although the full
effect of the price increase is not expected to be felt until August or
September.

FT  13 AUG 93 / VW probe may recall witnesses
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PUBLIC prosecutors investigating spying and theft allegations against
Volkswagen employees may recall witnesses for further questioning, following
reports that data belonging to Adam Opel, the German subsidiary of General
Motors, may have been punched into VW computers.
The possibility arose yesterday after a televised claim that a female VW
employee had said she and nine colleagues had been instructed to store
material by an assistant to Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, VW's new
production director, and the man at the centre of the investigation.
The woman, allegedly already interrogated, had apparently said nothing about
the origins of the material when questioned. However, she reportedly told a
third party that the documents carried an Opel logo.
Mr Georg Nauth, a senior prosecutor and spokesman for the investigators,
said the reports would be checked.
It is understood several witnesses from VW, under questioning, have said
they could not remember - or could not rule out - whether material they
handled bore marks identifying their origins as either Opel or GM.
Mr Walter Hiller, a member of the VW supervisory board, said yesterday the
board had been 'credibly assured' at a meeting last Friday that an internal
investigation at VW found there was no such material in the group's data
banks.
The meeting unanimously backed Mr Lopez and said there was no evidence to
warrant accusations of industrial espionage.
Meanwhile, Opel threatened further legal action if VW did not tell it in
precise detail the nature and contents of material destroyed in the week of
March 22 on instructions of Mr Lopez. VW last weekend admitted that papers,
including possibly secret or sensitive material, were destroyed at its
company guesthouse to prevent its circulation within VW.

FT  13 AUG 93 / C&amp;G will stop endowment mortgage sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU and NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHELTENHAM &amp; Gloucester, the UK's sixth largest building society, is to stop
selling endowment mortgages.
The move follows criticism of mortgage lenders because of the high charges,
including commissions, on endowment policies and their uncertain final
returns.
Yesterday C&amp;G said it would stop sales of life assurance after its five-year
exclusive distribution agreement with Legal &amp; General ended in November. It
would concentrate instead on the sale of interest-only and repayment
mortgages.
Mr Andrew Longhurst, C&amp;G's chief executive, said the society preferred to
let customers choose their own method of repayment. C&amp;G decided in 1990 to
stop urging its customers to take endowment mortgages. Currently one in 12
of C&amp;G's new borrowers is sold one, compared with an industry average of 69
per cent.
Customers who wish to have an insurance product will be referred to local
independent financial advisers who are responsible for referring roughly 60
per cent of C&amp;G's existing mortgage clients.
Mr Longhurst said C&amp;G's low cost base meant it did not need the extra income
from the sale of insurance products to remain profitable. 'We've come to the
point where we don't want to play that game any more,' he said of the
society's role as a 'tied agent' of Legal &amp; General.
In recent years, life insurers have competed intensely to sign up building
society outlets to sell their products exclusively and have rewarded them
with handsome commissions. Bancassurance, the sale of financial services
products through bank-type outlets, is regarded as the cheapest form of
distribution.
Building societies, however, have been criticised for urging unnecessary
insurance products, particularly endowment mortgages, on borrowers.
Discounted mortgages often require the borrower to sign up for an insurance
product. Mr Longhurst said C&amp;G would still offer discounted products.
Legal &amp; General said it was sorry to see the end of the relationship with
C&amp;G, but noted that 'the changing nature of C&amp;G's business spread makes it
no longer appropriate nor cost effective for a tied relationship'.

FT  13 AUG 93 / Bank ahead of schedule with Pounds 29bn gilt sales to fund
deficit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH and SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bank of England is ahead of schedule in financing the large UK budget
deficit - earning it praise yesterday from City economists.
Just 4 1/2 months into the financial year, the Bank has sold enough
gilt-edged securities to cover nearly 60 per cent of this year's likely
Pounds 50bn gap between government spending and revenues.
In spite of volatile conditions in the gilts market, the Bank yesterday sold
a further Pounds 400m in UK government bonds out of Pounds 1.2bn of tap
stocks announced on Wednesday afternoon.
About Pounds 29bn of gilts have been sold this year, with the biggest buyers
being pension funds and other institutions attracted by prospects of
relatively low inflation and falling interest rates.
Another factor has been the high yields associated with UK government bonds
 -at about 7 per cent for the 10-year maturity this is significantly higher
than for equivalent French, German, US and Japanese bonds. Overseas
investors have been keen to buy gilts, on beliefs that sterling would gain
against the D-Mark.
The Bank's effort to sell a record volume of gilts this year has been helped
by soaring gilt prices in recent weeks - even though they slipped back
slightly yesterday. Earlier this year many economists were worried that the
Bank would be unable to find buyers for such a big amount of bonds without a
large increase in yields.
Mr Michael Saunders, economist in London for Salomon Brothers, the US bank,
said he was impressed by the Bank's system of monthly gilt auctions which
helped investor planning.
Mr David Mackie of US bank JP Morgan said: 'The Bank has been astonishingly
successful (in its gilt sales).' But 'it's been fairly easy for them', as
retail price inflation has fallen to its lowest level for nearly 30 years.
Mr Roger Bootle, chief economist of Midland Bank, said the Bank had made a
tactical mistake by issuing too much longer dated stock, pushing up the
national debt more than was necessary, because of the higher yields on these
classes of bonds. The Bank said the bulk of the new issuance has been in
medium-dated gilts - in other words, those with a maturity of between seven
and 15 years.

FT  13 AUG 93 / British Coal seeks up to 15 pit closures in 8 months
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH COAL wants to close up to half its 30 working pits within eight
months after a thorough investigation of the energy market persuaded it that
only about a dozen pits have a long-term future.
British Coal's latest prognosis is far worse than anything it has
acknowledged publicly to date. It means a significantly larger contraction
of the industry than the government admitted was in prospect even last
October, when public anger forced a retreat on widespread pit closure plans.
In considering whether to sanction 15 closures in the current financial year
ending on March 27, as British Coal would prefer, ministers will be wary of
stirring controversy at a time when they need maximum Conservative backbench
support for coal privatisation this year and next.
The Department of Trade and Industry is thought to have accepted the
economic case for the 15 closures. Hesitation in implementing them stems
from concern about the political consequences.
Ministers and British Coal are, however, acutely aware that delay will store
up problems for the 12 or so core pits that are likely to comprise the
company when it is privatised.
British Coal's stockpiles, already above 14m tonnes, are growing at up to 1m
tonnes a month. The higher they rise the greater the likelihood that private
sector operators will add to the closure list in future years.
Mr Gerard McCloskey, disclosing British Coal's thinking in his Financial
Times International Coal Report weekly facsimile to subscribers, says that
not even 12 pits will survive long term if new private sector mine owners
opt to meet contracts from stocks.
Pressure is building for a closures announcement as early as next month. The
simultaneous closure of 15 pits is unlikely following the reaction to last
October's announcement.
More likely, British Coal will announce fewer than half a dozen closures at
first. More would follow piecemeal throughout the remainder of the financial
year, with public reaction influencing how many can close.
British Coal's problems stem from the coal white paper in March which
reprieved 12 pits earmarked for closure in October 1992 but did little to
find a market for their coal.
Since then, the electricity generators, which are British Coal's main
customers, have shown reluctance to buy coal above existing contracts.
Moroever, sales to generators under these contracts will fall from 40m
tonnes this year to 30m in 1994-95, making closures among the previous core
of 19 pits inevitable.
The government is committed to offer to the private sector any pits no
longer wanted by British Coal in the run-up to privatisation. Companies will
be offered subsidies for any coal they can sell to the generators before
privatisation.
British Coal last night refused to comment on how many closures would be
necessary.

FT  13 AUG 93 / Balladur calls for monetary reforms to beat speculators
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
REFORM OF the international monetary and financial system to clamp down on
currency speculation was called for last night by Mr Edouard Balladur, the
French prime minister.
Mr Balladur, who also confirmed plans to cut income tax next year to
revitalise the French economy, said he intended to stick to his firm
economic policy of protecting the franc.
He was speaking after the Bank of France released figures showing the
country's foreign reserves were hit hard by its intervention to support the
franc in the recent currency crisis. The central bank was left with a
deficit of more than FFr180bn (Pounds 20.3bn) in its foreign exchange
holdings.
The French premier blamed currency speculators for the crisis in the
European exchange rate mechanism which led to the fall in the franc's value.
'The crisis wasn't due to concern about the franc itself, but to a desire to
destroy the European monetary system,' he said, in a television interview
from his holiday home at Chamonix.
'Speculators want all the world's currencies to float freely so they can
make more money.'
Mr Balladur said that France planned to put forward proposals to curb
speculation and to stabilise the monetary system, although he did not
specify what they would be, how they could be implemented or in what forum
they would be made. 'We can't allow a situation to continue where so much
money can change hands in a very short time and threaten a nation's
security,' he said.
His remarks follow speculation in Germany about the possibility of EC
countries reintroducing some capital controls, although Germany has denied
that such a move is under discussion.
The French premier said he planned to discuss the monetary situation with Mr
Helmut Kohl, the German chancellor, when they meet in Bonn on August 26. He
said that the European Community member states needed to bring their
economic policies closer together.
On the domestic front, Mr Balladur said the main beneficiaries of tax cuts
would be the middle classes, who support the RPR and UDF parties that
dominate his coalition government.
He said he also planned to streamline the income tax system by reducing the
number of tax brackets. The tax cuts will form part of the 'second stage' of
the government's policies to be finalised on September 23.
Employment law reform is also expected to feature. Mr Balladur said: 'We
have got to find a way of ensuring that economic growth leads to job
creation.'

FT  13 AUG 93 / Output fall casts doubt on strength of UK recovery: Jobless
total up for first time since January
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER and STEPHANIE FLANDERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DOUBTS ABOUT the strength of the UK economic recovery increased yesterday
with the news that manufacturing output fell steeply in June while
unemployment rose slightly last month.
Although the figures are unlikely to indicate a reversal in the UK's
economic fortunes, they highlight the patchy nature of the recovery.
Manufacturing output fell by a seasonally adjusted 2.1 per cent in June
compared with the previous month.
The drop more than offset a 1.8 per cent rise in May and took output back to
roughly the same level as in February.
Other official figures showed that the number of people out of work and
claiming benefit rose a seasonally-adjusted 200 last month after a revised
fall of 4,800 in June.
The increase, the first since January, took the jobless total to 2.91m, a
rate of 10.4 per cent. Unadjusted, unemployment rose by 64,000 to 2.92m.
Average earnings growth slowed again, underlining the weakness of employee
wage negotiators, in spite of recent falls in unemployment.
Earnings rose an underlying 3 1/2 per cent in the year to June from 3 3/4
per cent in May, pushed lower by the 1.5 per cent ceiling on public sector
pay settlements.
The pound slipped back on the worse-than-expected economic news to close 1
1/4 pfennigs lower on the day at DM2.5175. Although share price gains were
modest, the FT-SE 100 index reached a record close of 3,009.1, up 3 points
on the day.
The Central Statistical Office said the fall in manufacturing output, the
sharpest monthly drop since February 1988, was largely a correction from
May's figures inflated by the late bank holiday. The drop was widely spread
across industry, although it was slightly sharper for metals and mineral
production.
In the three months to June, manufacturing output rose by 1.4 per cent
compared with the previous quarter but the bigger-than-expected downturn in
June will fuel speculation that the recovery may be slowing.
Most of the quarterly growth came from higher output of investment goods.
Production in this sector rose by 2.4 per cent compared with the three
months to March.
In the consumer goods sector, output rose 0.7 per cent in the latest three
months, with car production the only buoyant category, rising 10.2 per cent
quarter-on-quarter.
According to the CSO's figures, manufacturing output in the three months to
June was 3.1 per cent higher than the same period a year ago.
Total industrial production, which includes energy and water supply, fell
0.6 per cent month-on-month but rose by 0.8 per cent over the entire quarter
compared with the first three months of the year.
Mr David Hunt, the employment secretary, was optimistic that the latest
jobless figures pointed to 'encouraging signs'.
'Although headline unemployment always rises in July as 600,000 school and
college leavers start to flood on to the labour market, today's increase of
200 in the seasonally adjusted figure is in marked contrast with this time
last year when the figure rose by 36,000,' he said.

FT  12 AUG 93 / (CORRECTED) UK Company News: Cable and Wireless wins
Hungarian contract
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Correction (published 13th August 1993) appended to this article.
CABLE AND Wireless, the UK telecommunications group, has won a licence for a
national paging network awarded by the Hungarian government.
The licence was awarded to Radio Telecommunications Company, a joint venture
in which C&amp;W has a 49 per cent stake. Other partners include the state
telecommunications company.
The contract is a further boost to C&amp;W's ambition to become a significant
force in Hungary, whose state telecommunications company looks set to become
the first of those in east European to be privatised.
The contract will complement RTC's existing cellular mobile contract. It is
investing Pounds 27m in infrastructure for the cellular network, which is
due to launched at the end of this year.
C&amp;W's has other east European ventures in Belarus, Russia, and the Baltic
states. However, its main investment focus is in the UK, through Mercury
Communications, and in Asia Pacific, where it has a majority stake in Hong
Kong Telecom.
CORRECTION
A company in which Cable and Wireless has a 49 per cent stake was this week
awarded a licence to provide a national paging service in Bulgaria, not in
Hungary as reported in some editions yesterday.

NORGESKREDITT, Norway's largest private-sector mortgage company, increased
profits before tax to NKr148.9m (Dollars 20.02m) in the first six months
from NKr66.6m in the same 1992 period.
The company said it had been helped by the fall in Norwegian interest rates.
Higher net interest income and gains on bond and share trading more than
offset an increase in loan losses, it stated.
Net interest income rose to NKr150.7m from NKr105.3m, while gains from
securities amounted to NKr51.8m, compared with a NKr1.2m loss in the first
half of 1992.
Loan losses increased to NKr28.0m from NKr22.1m. The company said it held 13
repossessed commercial properties, as at June 30, with a book value of
NKr38.1m.
Norgeskreditt won shareholder backing for its plan to become a commercial
bank in April.

</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Boris Fyodorov, the Russian finance minister, said yesterday it was
unlikely that a handful of former Soviet republics would be able soon to
recreate either a rouble zone or an economic union.
He denied Russia was seeking to write off debts to the west, saying that a
statement to this effect had been the personal opinion of Mr Konstantin
Kagalovsky, Russia's representative at the International Monetary Fund.
Negotiations were under way with republics that wanted to keep the rouble as
their currency, Mr Fyodorov said, but 'what will happen to the rouble zone
remains to be seen'. The central bank's botched monetary reform which
proclaimed to endow Russia with a currency of its own and to cut off other
republics, had shown 'these issues cannot be resolved so easily,' he added.
He also expressed scepticism on plans for economic union with Ukraine and
Belarus.

FT  12 AUG 93 / Gore in new look at flood control
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STATE floodplain managers have begun working with the White House to develop
new approaches to flood control, in the wake of this year's devastating
Mississippi floods.
Mr Larry Larson, head of the floodplain management and dam safety programmes
for Wisconsin and executive director of the Association of State Floodplain
Managers, said yesterday his organisation had begun to work with Vice
President Al Gore and hoped to work out better ways of keeping people out of
harm's way.
'We as floodplain managers would hate to see the people affected by this
flood walk away thinking it will never happen again. It will happen again,'
Mr Larson said.
Mr Larson warned that many of the earthwork levees built along the river
were only designed to contain much lesser degrees of flooding. Sandbag
barricades on top of the levees simply increased the pressure elsewhere.
'Many of the people along the river understood that if that levee on the
other side of the river failed, their levee would be under much less
pressure,' he said.
Alternatives to building more and higher levees included relocating
individual buildings or whole communities on higher ground, or lifting
building foundations.
Some small towns badly hit by this year's floods have already started
discussions with the Federal Emergency Management Agency on the possibility
of moving to higher ground.
Mr Larson's call was echoed by Mr Kevin Coyle, head of the American Rivers
environmental group. Mr Coyle urged the White House to appoint a commission
to rethink the management of the Mississippi basin, and to throw its weight
behind a reform of the government flood insurance programme, which he said
had encouraged people to build in the path of likely flooding.
President Bill Clinton will sign a Dollars 6.3bn flood relief bill today in
St Louis, heart of the flood-stricken Midwest, Reuter reports.

FT  12 AUG 93 / Cuba tipped as holiday hot spot
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO LARGE travel companies yesterday designated Cuba as the next mass-market
holiday destination and announced programmes which will immediately
quadruple the number of UK visitors to the island.
Airtours, the second-largest tour operator, is offering two-week holidays at
the beach resort of Varadero from next May, with prices from Pounds 299 to
Pounds 1,399. Mr Richard Carrick, Airtours marketing director, said the
resort had several foreign-managed hotels.
Mr Carrick refused to say how many holidaymakers Airtours would take to
Cuba. He said, however, that the company would offer weekly charter flights
from Gatwick via Manchester to Varadero from early May to mid-October.
This suggests that Airtours plans to fly about 8,000 travellers to Cuba
during this period. Mr Carrick said the programme would be extended into the
winter if it proved successful.
Unijet, another tour operator, said it also intended to announce a programme
to Cuba. Mr Chris Parker, Unijet chairman, said the company planned to take
1,000 holidaymakers to Cuba next year and hoped to increase its capacity to
3,000 a year.
Mr Carrick said authoritative statistics were not available, but an
estimated 3,000 UK residents were thought to have visited Cuba last year.

FT  12 AUG 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE futures market powered to a new high yesterday as buyers broke cover on
the back of renewed hopes for European interest rate cuts and growing
confidence in the UK economy, writes Christopher Price.
Within an hour of opening the September contract was beginning its surge
forward, finding resistance levels at 3,006 and 3,010 against any attempt at
profit-taking.
It was familiar sentiment driving September on. Further trimming of French
rates, with rumours of a full one-point cut today were being heard. News of
a positive Bank of England report on inflation also heightened speculation
of a UK rate cut, which added further spice to the very firm gilts market.
Dealers said that the pace of the rally prompted large-scale arbitraging
between the future and cash markets which mopped up excess stock and
squeezed the equity side higher. But there were genuine buyers too, as
yesterday's turnover of over 10,000 contracts showed.
September eventually closed at 3,019, a 39-point rise on the day and a
10-point premium to its fair value level of about three.
Turnover in traded options also reflected the day's excitement, with 46,500
contracts dealt.
British Gas was the leading stock option, with 5,857 contracts traded,
followed by BT on 3,264. FT-SE volume was 13,037 contracts.

FT  12 AUG 93 / London Stock Exchange: Footsie breaks through 3,000 barrier
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FT-SE 3,000 mark became the test of the stock market's virility
yesterday and the successful challenge to this important benchmark dominated
all other considerations. The pace was set by the stock index futures sector
and it was the success of the September contract in breaking through to new
highs that drove the stock market to its new peak.
The final reading showed the FT-SE Index at an all-time high of 3,006.1, a
net gain of 34.5 on the day. Equities opened lower but London was soon
encouraged by a further cut in interest rates in France. When the stock
index futures opened, share prices began to move ahead and the 3,000 level
on the Footsie was first challenged around mid-session.
Heavy arbitrage trading developed, with the large securities firms
endeavouring to profit by selling the future contract at its peak and then
buying the underlying stocks. However, serious problems appeared when they
found stock very difficult to find. A bidding competition soon commenced and
share prices were driven yet further ahead.
The upturn was checked for a while, however, when the selling of the future
took the steam out of the situation. But buyers for the future soon
reappeared and there was no holding either the September contract or the
stock market. At best, the Footsie set a new trading high of 3,010.1.
Trading volume, slow to begin with, rose sharply in the second half of the
session and the final Seaq figure of 830.4m shares compared with 771.9m on
Tuesday.
Dealers maintained that the managers of the big investment funds had mostly
kept out of yesterday's highly-charged market. In the previous session,
customer, or genuine investment business in equities rose to Pounds 1.57bn,
fully sustaining the excellent volume levels recorded over the past eleven
months.
The market was led by sectors expected to benefit from the cut in UK base
rates which is now confidently expected this autumn. The banking sector,
having ridden through its reporting season, renewed its advance, behind the
lead of HSBC which continued to benefit from the good showing of its UK
Midland banking subsidiary.
Consumer stocks, including stores and brewers, were to the fore as investors
looked for higher profits as the improvement in the UK economy feeds
through. But the pharmaceutical sector, which has performed so poorly this
year, continued to drag behind the rest of the market.
Also weak again were shares in BOC, which shook the stock market this week
with the issue of a veiled profits warning. Some analysts continued to warn
that BOC's experience underlines worries over the high ratings on UK
equities.
With market firms totally preoccupied with the day's events, equity
strategists were not hurrying to change longer term views on the market
yesterday. The question asked at every meeting last night was whether the
institutions will now come in to support share prices above 3,000 or whether
they will stand back and see if prices can hold at these levels.
At NatWest Securities, Mr Rob Buckland pointed out that the new bullish
factor for equities over the past fortnight was the strength of the
government bond market, and that much will depend on how this sector
performs.

FT  12 AUG 93 / London Stock Exchange: Brewery deal hint
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and ZHANG TINGTING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Speculation that Grand Metropolitan may be making renewed attempts to sell
its Chef and Brewer chain of pub-restaurants helped spur the shares on in a
strong drinks sector. Analysts said the rumours had been prompted by the
sale earlier this week of 44 pubs by Bass to Greene King for Pounds 17.5m.
The drinks sector has been alive with talk of the imminent sale of Chef and
Brewer for several months, but the consensus in the market was that
negotiations with several parties had foundered over price. Grand Met was
thought to be seeking around Pounds 750m for the 1,600-strong chain.
However, drinks specialists said that the company may now be considering
splitting up the division into more saleable parcels. Whitbread was one name
being linked to the speculation yesterday.
Shares in Grand Met, boosted also by Procter and Gamble figures from the US,
gained 14 to 442p. Bass gained 8 to 490p as it announced good trading at its
Holiday Inn chain. Whitbread powered ahead on further speculation that the
group may consider enfranchising its non-voting shares. The shares added 17
1/2 to 533p.
BP was one of only a handful of Footsie 100 stocks to lose ground on a day
when the market raced ahead to an all-time high, the shares coming under
increasingly heavy bouts of straight selling and switching pressure. Some of
the big international funds were said to have sold BP and switched into
Shell, with the performances of the respective share prices giving added
credence to the market stories.
BP lost 3 1/2 to 305 1/2 p, having been as low of 303 1/2 p at one point
during the session. Turnover was a heavy 12m shares. Shell, on the other
hand, rose 8 to a 10-year high of 652p.
'There seems to be growing scepticism among the institutions about BP's
recovery story,' said one analyst who added that 'BP shares have lost their
momentum'.
The exploration and production sub-sector remained firmly in the doldrums,
beset by the recent poor performance of crude oil prices. The resignation on
Tuesday of Mr John Walmsley, Enterprise Oil's finance director and one of
the architects of the oil company's success during 1980s and 1990s,
continued to weigh on the company's shares which fell further to 435p before
stabilising and settling 2 easier at 437p on relatively high turnover of
2.1m. NatWest Securities oil team said the resignation 'will do little to
assuage the market's faltering confidence in Enterprise'. Hopes that Lasmo
shares might progress at the expense of Enterprise failed to materialise,
with Lasmo closing marginally easier at 135p.
Standard Chartered, due to announce interims this morning, recovered
strongly from an early poor performance triggered largely by worries that
the figures could be accompanied by a sizeable cash call. 'If there is a
rights issue, and that is by no means certain, then the market is quite
prepared,' said one trader. Standard fell to 880p at the outset, but early
selling quickly dried up, to be replaced by strong buying interest which
drove the shares back up to a closing level of 898p, a net rise of 16.
Standard's profits are forecast to rise from last year's Pounds 64m to
around Pounds 1215m to Pounds 180m with the dividend expected to be
increased to 8p from 7p.
HSBC aced up 23 to 744p, reflecting the bank's exceptionally strong
interests in the Pacific Rim and its purchase of Midland Bank at what is
seen as just about the bottom of the banking cycle.
The property sector was the best performer in the market as investors sought
both recovery potential and yield attractions. British Land, buoyed by its
deal with the Quantum Fund, gained 8 to 366p, Hammerson added 11 to 349p,
Land Securities 15 to 66p and MEPC 15 to 493p.
Bargain-hunters were again seen in Owners Abroad as investors, soothed by
Tuesday's appointment of a new chairman, sought stock. Dealers said one
block of 2m shares was bought at 78p and sold on at 78 1/2 p. Total turnover
was 5.6m. The shares added 2 to 79p. Switching out of rival tour operator
Airtours left the stock 6 adrift at 369p.
Theme park operator Euro Disney recovered on news of the French rate cut and
the shares appreciated 22 to 705p. Kingfisher, which owns the Darty French
retail chain, surged 19 to 654p. Guinness gained 11 to 472p. The group has a
24.6 per cent cross-holding with the French luxury goods group LVMH.
Shares in Reuters Holdings, the global data transmission group, were active
again after Daily Mail &amp; General Trust issued a Pounds 50m bond convertible
into Reuters stock held by the trust. Reuters shares eased another 19 to
1505p on the realisation that this move will make more stock available in
the market. Further profit-taking after the recent strength of the share
price was also a significant factor.

The market gave an immediate thumbs up to Commercial Union's interim
results, with dealers hoisting the share price after the unexpected moves on
the dividend front.
CU increased its interim dividend from 8.95p to 15.1p, brought forward the
payment date and offered shareholders an enhanced scrip dividend alternative
worth 22.65p a share.
Half-year profits of Pounds 65.5 were well ahead of market expectations
which had ranged up to Pounds 60m and compared with a loss of Pounds 23.7m.
But it was the moves on the dividend which triggered a sharp rise in CU
shares. They moved to a peak 667p immediately following the results before
easing back to end a busy session a net 11 higher at 661p. 'It was a
beautifully timed move, coming the day after GenAcc maintained their interim
payment,' said one marketmaker.
Analysts moved quickly to increase their full year forecasts; Morgan Stanley
moved up to Pounds 200m for the full-year while BZW upped their expectation
from Pounds 175m to Pounds 188m with a dividend forecast of 24.5p.

FT  12 AUG 93 / London Stock Exchange: Heavy trading in Gas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and ZHANG TINGTING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE STRONG build-up of interest in British Gas shares evident since the
start of this week intensified yesterday when turnover in the stock expanded
to a hefty 21m shares in the wake of buy recommendations from many of the
market's top broking firms.
These were said to have included leading lights such as Kleinwort Benson,
James Capel, SG Warburg and UBS.
The weight of buying of Gas shares was sufficient to catapult the stock to
an all-time record of 329p. The shares came off the top late in the session
to close a net 13 1/2 higher at 328p. Since the start of this week Gas
shares have risen 21p.
There were lingering concerns that the recent bout of strong buying interest
in Gas could have been triggered by a leak of the conclusions of the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission inquiry into the gas industry, expected
next Tuesday. The full inquiry into British Gas will be published in
September. There have been worries in the market that the MMC might
recommend the break up of Gas.
Dealers also pointed to the very high levels of activity in Gas shares this
week. On Monday turnover was a heavy 19m and on Tuesday reached 11m.
Kleinwort Benson, in a buy note on British Gas, published on Tuesday, said
that while it is dangerous to prejudge the MMC enquiries it believes most of
the possible changes will have a relatively small impact on short-run
profitability and that in the long run impact will be more than balanced by
the growth in unregulated earnings. 'Gas's yield relative more than
discounts the enquiry; given the downward trend in interest rates, the 6 per
cent yield is attractive,' said the Kleinwort team.
Other analysts adopted a more cautious view, however, pointing out that
after their recent bout of exceptional outperformance, Gas shares could
attract profit-taking, with one adding that 'the shares have offered an
above average yield since the 1986 privatisation'.

FT  12 AUG 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Schering stars as Germany
joins afternoon rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOURSES climbed consistently over the day, a trend reflected dramatically in
Germany where the Ibis-indicated, post-bourse DAX index rose to 1,894.63, up
1.6 per cent from its earlier close on short covering and foreign buy
orders, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT ended the official session with the DAX just 0.64 higher at
1,865.80 as turnover fell from DM8.9bn to DM8.4bn. The big winner at this
level was Schering, the pharmaceutical group, which closed DM54 higher at
DM926 and went on to DM935, up 7.2 per cent on the day, after hours.
Schering said in New York last night that its Betaseron multiple sclerosis
drug will yield a yearly average of Dollars 8,500 to Dollars 10,000 per
patient. Mr Mark Tracey, of Goldman Sachs in London, raised his earnings
estimates on this basis and is now forecasting 30 per cent annual earnings
growth from DM40 a share in 1993.
Meanwhile, the construction group, Hochtief, rose DM23 to DM1,148 as it
confirmed that the British government had invited it to bid for a contract
to build a high-speed rail link between the Channel Tunnel and London.
Mr Michael Geiger, of NatWest Securities, thought it unlikely that Hochtief
would get the contract but the invitation highlighted its attractions on a
1994 p/e of 14.7, adjusted for work in progress, off-balance sheet work,
overstated provisions and Hochtief's virtual 20 per cent stake in its
competitor, Holzmann.
Meanwhile PWA, the paper group, and Kugelfischer, the ball bearing
manufacturer, rose DM5.80 to DM182.80 and DM6 to DM140 for two-day gains of
DM13.30, and DM17 respectively. Mr Geiger said that while DAX stocks are
nearing their all-time highs, a number of companies in the broader market
still have a long way to go; all-time highs for PWA and Kugelfischer are
DM349, and DM507.
PARIS reported strong foreign buying and domestic institutional selling as
the CAC-40 index rose by 27.61 or 1.3 per cent to a new high of 2,167.39.
Interest rate hopes were behind the buying, as the Bank of France cut its
24-hour lending rate for the second time this week. Turnover was unusually
heavy at FFr5.4bn, up from FFr3.45bn.
Suez traded in an exceptionally heavy 1.28m shares as the share price
climbed FFr8.40 to FFr345.40 ahead of an expected change in its CAC-40
weighting today. Michelin rose another FFr5.70 to FFr199.20 as Lehman
Brothers, which gave the stock an outperform rating on Tuesday, said that
European tyre stocks were cheap relative ot other automotive stocks, and
that the market could focus on the French market-leader as the new big
cost-cutting story.
MADRID gave foreign buying, and lower rates in the interbank and secondary
debt markets the credit for its new high as the general index closed 2.55
higher at 274.18.
Turnover climbed from Pta12.53bn to Pta20.75bn. Banesto stood out with a
rise of Pta345, or nearly 15 per cent to Pta2,675 on the success of its
capital raising operations.
AMSTERDAM's CBS Tendency index rose 2.50 to 127.10 as cyclical stocks
received a boost from better than expected half year figures from Hoogovens.
Strong foreign demand developed from London and New York, while local
traders continued to cover substantial short positions.
Hoogovens rose Fl 4.80 to a 12-month high of Fl 51.30. Among other
cyclicals, DSM added Fl 3.10 to Fl 98.30 and Akzo was up Fl 4.40 at Fl
170.50.
KLM rose Fl 2.20 or 6.4 per cent to a 12 month high of Fl 36.60 on plans to
scrap its Royal Class service and increase the number of tourist class
seats.
MILAN began nervously, still assessing Ferruzzi and Montedison's troubles,
but the market picked up early losses as the outlook for lower interest
rates lifted the mood. The Comit index ended 0.01 higher at 588.78. Fiat
continued higher in rumour-driven trade, adding L84 to L7,095 ahead of
today's expiry of options and Olivetti put on L79 to L2,059, also amid
speculation about asset sales.
Banks remained under pressure over concern at their exposure to debts of the
Ferruzzi group. Mediobanca fell L50 to L16,200 and Credito Italiano slid L15
to L2,630. Ferruzzi and Montedison remained suspended, but Fondiaria, the
insurance subsidiary, shed L160 to L30,890.
ZURICH picked up after a weak start and the SMI index finished 26.2 higher
at 2,410.7. UBS bearers shrugged off the profit-taking of the previous two
days and rose SFr18 to SFr1,199 in brisk trade ahead of today's half yearly
results, and Ciba Geigy bearers recovered SFr13 to SFr749 after their recent
weakness.
Cyclical shares also saw good gains. Fischer jumped SFr40 to SFr965 after
Tuesday's SFr35 drop. Alusuisse bearers added SFr16 to SFr570 and Holderbank
ended up SFr21 at SFr789.
STOCKHOLM overcame early profit-taking to turn higher amid speculation that
the Riksbank will cut its official marginal rate today. The Affarsvarlden
index rose 13.2 to 1,260.3. A smaller than expected first half loss from
SKF, the ball bearing manufacturer, helped the mood; the B-shares rose SKr3
to SKr115.
OSLO soared 2.4 per cent to a 1993 high with lower money market rates
contributing to the rise. The all-share index rose 13.17 to 563.63 in heavy
turnover of NKr743m.

bondyields tumble

Wall Street
ANOTHER record-setting day saw US share prices soar yesterday afternoon on
the back of tumbling bond yields, with strong gains in semiconductor stocks
offsetting some losses in healthcare issues and mining stocks, writes Karen
Zagor in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 10.62 to set a new record of
3,583.35. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was 1 higher at
450.46, while the Amex composite eased 0.32 at 438.87, and the Nasdaq
composite firmed 1.69 at 718.77. Trading volume on the NYSE was more than
266m shares, and rises outnumbered declines by 1,057 to 856.
In the absence of any significant economic reports yesterday, market
movement was dominated by sector news.
The semiconductor sector was bolstered by Tuesday's report of unexpectedly
strong orders for chips. On the big board, shares in Motorola firmed Dollars
1 3/8 to Dollars 96 1/4 , Texas Instruments gained Dollars 1 to Dollars 77
1/2 after hitting a 52-week high earlier in the day, and Advanced Micro
Devices rose Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 29 5/8 . Intel added Dollars 1 7/8 to
Dollars 58 3/4 in Nasdaq trading.
Shares in mining companies moved lower in tandem with falling gold prices.
In Comex trading, the December gold price was quoted Dollars 5.70 an ounce
lower at Dollars 378.70. American Barrick lost Dollars 3/8 to Dollars 25 1/8
, Newmont Mining fell Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 50 3/8 and Amax eased Dollars
 1/8 to Dollars 24 5/8 .
Among other featured issues, Eaton Corp added Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 45 3/8
, partly recouping its Tuesday losses of Dollars 1 1/4 following news that
the company has entered a definitive agreement to buy Westinghouse
Electric's distribution and control business for Dollars 1.1bn, plus the
assumption of liabilities. Shares in Westinghouse slid Dollars  1/8 to
Dollars 15 3/4 .
In the tobacco sector, RJR Nabisco Holdings held steady in spite of reports
in the Wall Street Journal that the FTC plan to recommend a ban of the
company's popular Joe Camel advertising campaign.
Shares in health maintenance companies tumbled after Donaldson, Lufkin &amp;
Jenrette cut its ratings on the group. Oxford Health Plans plummeted Dollars
8 1/4 to Dollars 62 3/4 , Ramsay-HMO dropped Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 28,
Healthsource fell Dollars 4 3/4 at Dollars 37 1/8 and United Healthcare
tumbled Dollars 6 3/4 to Dollars 52 3/4 .
Chemical Waste Management lost Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 9 3/8 after the
company said it was suspending its quarterly dividend payments because of
uncertain market conditions.
Equitable Companies climbed Dollars 4 to a 52-week high of Dollars 25 1/4
after the company turned in second quarter earnings of Dollars 47.5m against
an operating loss of Dollars 18.8m a year earlier. Salomon Brothers lifted
its rating on the stock to 'buy' from 'hold', reflecting the improved
performance and predictions of improved sales momentum in the second half.
Canada
TORONTO stock prices closed mixed in busy trading, as the market eased after
three days of solid gains.
According to preliminary figures, the TSE-300 index fell 12.55 points, or
0.31 per cent, to 4,015.89, but advancing issues outnumbered declines 372 to
340. Volume was 66.431m shares, up from 63.038m shares on Tuesday, and
trading value rose to CDollars 810.1m.

FT  12 AUG 93 / World Stock Markets: Neighbours travel in opposite
directions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TURKEY's seemingly inexorable rise ran out of steam last month, while its
neighbour, Greece, moved in the opposite direction.
Data provided by the IFC, part of the World Bank, shows that the Turkish
equity market fell by 11.6 per cent in dollar terms during July.
'There was no one big item of bad news that pushed the market down,' said Mr
Stuart Harley of Schroders in London. 'But there was a series of
uncertainties and the market had little to drive it.'
Political uncertainties in the run up to the conferences of the government
coalition partners in October and November began to take a toll, as did the
departure of Mr Rusdu Saracoglu, the central bank governor.
Indeed, the market seemed unmoved even by some very strong half-yearly
results, including a 1,636 per cent rise in first half profits from Tofas,
the car manufacturer.
Greece, conversely, managed a 9.9 per cent rise in dollar terms, in spite of
delays in the privatisation of OTE, the state telecommunications company.
Ms Maryam Mansoury of Lehman Brothers cites falling inflation, lower
interest rates and good earnings growth as the spur, together with the
stimulus of a seven-year, Dollars 20bn restructuring loan from the EC. She
believes that the outcome of a parliamentary vote tomorrow on the OTE
sell-off will provide additional momentum, since the outcome will remove a
major uncertainty.

FT  12 AUG 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei posts third
consecutive gain on political hopes

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HOPES that the new government will increase spending in telecommunication
infrastructure, among other initiatives, encouraged active buying by foreign
investors and investment trusts, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei average posted its third consecutive rise with a gain of 238.82,
or 1.2 per cent to 20,732.57. It saw a day's low of 20,489.05 during the
first hour of trading, and a high of 20,756.08 just before the close.
While many Japanese investors were absent for the Obon holiday period,
volume rose to 360m shares from 274m, rising above the 300m level for the
first time since August 4.
Gainers led losers by 814 to 184 with 165 unchanged, and the Topix index of
all first section stocks rose 19.01 to a new high for the year of 1,680.23.
In London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 2.65 to 1,283.20.
Interest rate-sensitive stocks picked up as bond yields fell on hopes of
lower interest rates. The yield on the No 145 10 year benchmark fell 0.04
percentage points to 4.08 per cent. However, the sharp rise in the yen had
little effect on export- related stocks. The dollar closed down at a record
Y103.77, down Y0.70.
Foreigners and dealers bought Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, lifting
sentiment overall. NTT gained Y25,000 to Y971,000. Cable companies were also
seen as beneficiaries of the government's plans to revamp the country's
telecom infrastructure. Mitsubishi Cable, the most active issue of the day,
rose Y40 to Y895.
Nippon Express, the parcel delivery company, rose Y20 to Y1,120; investors
expect a rise in profitability, because of an easing of regulations in the
transport market.
Mounting hopes of a housing tax cut continued to boost housing related
stocks. Sekisui House rose Y40 to Y1,350 and Daiwa House gained Y50 to
Y1,660.
Financials were higher on hopes of a discount rate cut by the Bank of Japan.
Industrial Bank of Japan rose Y60 to Y3,450. Brokers were also higher, the
sector rising 3.9 per cent. Nomura Securities rose Y80 to Y2,190 and Nikko
Securities advanced Y80 to Y1,300.
High-technology issues failed to react to the higher yen. NEC rose Y20 to
Y1,030 and Matsushita Electric Industrial gained Y10 to Y1,400. Sony,
however, was one of the few losers of the day, falling Y60 to Y4,430.
In Osaka the OSE average advanced 169.34 to 22,625.56 in volume of 52.1m
shares. High-technology related stocks were higher, with Rohm, in
semiconductors, up Y90 to Y3,050.
Roundup
US influences brought more angst to the Antipodes. Bombay was closed for a
Hindu festival.
NEW ZEALAND brokers offered US worries over legal action by the
communication and energy workers union over Telecom's restructuring plans as
one reason why the shares fell seven cents to NZDollars 3.98. Another was a
rumoured profit-taking recommendation by a large US brokerage house.
Telecom led the market down, the NZSE-40 index falling 20.56 to 1,883.41 in
turnover of NZDollars 45m.
AUSTRALIA featured more volatility in CSR as the All Ordinaries index closed
a mere 0.6 higher at 1,861.0. CSR dropped another 16 cents in early trade,
following Monday's US court award of punitive damages in an asbestos case.
But it rebounded to close 8 cents higher at ADollars 4.15, in some 4.4m
shares, after CSR said that it was not concerned by the finding.
HONG KONG closed moderately higher as late demand reversed early losses, but
most of the buying interest was focused on China-linked stocks as the Hang
Seng Index ended 27.82 higher at 7,357.63. Turnover was flat at HKDollars
4.46bn.
SINGAPORE flattened out after Tuesday's climb, the Straits Times Industrial
index closing 2.26 higher at 1,901.10 on late gains after profit-taking for
most of the day. Volume fell from 188.9m to 140.7m shares. SEOUL rose again
on buying of large-capitalisation shares, the composite stock index putting
on 4.21 at 723.65.
BANGKOK celebrated Queen Sirikit's birthday a day in advance with the SET
index up 8.08 to 963.17. Turnover was heavy at Bt10.1bn, and devoted mostly
to property, media and finance issues.
JAKARTA saw strong buying interest as the JKSE index rose 7.52 to 377.35.
MANILA reported heavy foreign buying in the newly-listed JG Summit, 40
centavos higher at 6.80 pesos as the composite index rose 13.48 to 1,747.67.
TAIWAN ended off its peak after profit-taking in the last hour, the weighted
index ending 21.73 higher at 4,115.04, after 4,167.49. Turnover soared from
TDollars 17.2bn to TDollars 26.62 billion, the highest since May.
Construction stocks jumped by 2.25 per cent on news that the finance
ministry was considering extending maturities of housing loans.

FT  12 AUG 93 / Money Markets: Sterling futures rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STERLING interest rate futures enjoyed a modest rise yesterday as dealers
took the view that the low inflation outlook in the UK made a cut in base
rates more likely, writes James Blitz.
In its quarterly inflation report published on Tuesday, the Bank of England
said that the prospect of underlying inflation dropping to the lower part of
the government's 1-4 per cent target range over the next four years was
'within reach'. The Bank was also relatively upbeat about the chances of a
strong UK recovery in the first half of this year.
Yesterday was the first opportunity that interest rate dealers had to digest
the contents of the report. They pushed the September short sterling
contract up 5 basis points to a close of 94.26.
But traders continued to think there was more likelihood of a base rate cut
at the turn of the year, with the December contract closing at 94.76.
Nevertheless, one London money market dealer said that, at current levels,
the September contract was fairly priced and might be worth buying.
Sterling cash markets were quiet. A Pounds 900m shortage was removed with no
need for late assistance. Three month money closed more or less unchanged at
5.78 per cent.
European markets were dominated by the second cut this week in the Bank of
France's overnight rate of lending, this time from 9.75 per cent to 9.25 per
cent.
The  1/2 percentage point cut confirmed the French central bank's policy of
slowly easing monetary policy in the wake of the widening of the exchange
rate mechanism's bands. But it led to a very strong rise in the September
French franc interest rate contract, up 27 basis points to close at 93.38.
Three month money fell by 0.40 percentage points from 8 per cent to 7.60 per
cent.
The Bundesbank yesterday surprised some market participants by adding a net
DM10.3bn of liquidity in its weekly money market operation, instead of
draining funds in the wake of the recent intervention in support of the
French franc.
With a fixed rate repo set at 6.80 per cent this week, that should ensure
that call money fluctuates between 6.80 per cent and 7 per cent over the
next week. Call money was yesterday hovering at around 6.81 per cent for
most of the day.

FT  12 AUG 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Yen at new post-war highs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE attention of foreign exchange dealers moved away from Europe to Asia
yesterday, as the Japanese yen enjoyed a remarkable rally against the dollar
in Wednesday's Asian trading, writes James Blitz.
The main trigger for this surge was the news that Japan's trade surplus in
July had widened from Dollars 9.23bn a year ago to Dollars 11.82bn. Trade
with the US swelled to an unadjusted Dollars 4.68bn surplus from Dollars
3.81bn in the previous month.
The news pushed the yen from Y104.50 late on Tuesday to a post-war low of
Y103.50 on Wednesday afternoon in Europe. The currency later closed in
London at Y103.70. Repeated rounds of intervention from the Bank of Japan
and other central banks failed to stem the tide.
Dealers said that the main impetus behind yesterday's move was from US
investment funds and Japanese exporters. But Mr Marc Hendricks, an economist
at Swiss Banking Corporation in London, said that the trade surplus figures
were not just a news item, but an underlying cause of the yen's strength.
'Japanese companies are repatriating their profits and refusing to re-invest
in Europe because of their long-term balance sheet problems,' he said. 'That
is the source of the yen's strength.'
Inside the European exchange rate mechanism, the main focus was on France's
decision to cut its overnight rate of lending for the second time this week,
this time by  1/2 a percentage point to 9.25 per cent.
The move at first led to a slight depreciation of the franc, but later the
currency recovered strongly against the D-Mark to close at FFr3.511 from a
previous FFr3.521. That appreciation was partly due to the Bundesbank's
decision to add liquidity to its domestic money markets, keeping the cost of
overnight funds low.
However, the German move was insufficient to stop heavy selling of the
Austrian schilling especially in options and forward markets.
The Austrian authorities have kept their currency in a very tight range
against the D-Mark of about Sch7.01-Sch7.05. But yesterday, the currency
traded as low as Sch7.0473.
Mr Jeremy Hawkins, economics adviser at Bank of America in London, said that
problems in the ERM were encouraging dealers to test the parities between
Europe's traditionally close currencies.
The Bundesbank's money market operations helped the dollar to gain a full
pfennig against the D-Mark, to close at DM1.7180.
Throughout most of yesterday's trading, sterling weakened as dealers
suspected that European central banks were selling the currency to help
boost reserves. However, the pound recovered at the end of European trading,
supported by continuing strength of the UK's equity and gilt markets. The
pound closed at DM2.5300, up  1/4 pfennig on the day.

FT  12 AUG 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: US Midwest crop losses
estimated at Dollars 2.5bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CHICAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Mike Espy, US agriculture secretary, said yesterday his country's maize
and soyabean harvest would be adequate to meet world demand, despite summer
floods that had devasted large portions of some of the most fertile crop
land.
The US Department of Agriculture conducted its most extensive survey ever of
crop conditions during the first week in August, and yesterday released the
results.
Tha agency said crop losses due to flooding and drought in Midwestern states
amounted to Dollars 2.5bn. And it revised its estimate of the maize crop to
7.423bn bushels, down 22 per cent from last year's harvest and below private
forecasters estimates of about 7.5bn.
Despite the drop, Mr Espy said he expected little movement in maize prices
today. Although this year's crop will be short, there are ample maize
supplies in storage to meet customer needs. The US has 2.124 billion bushels
of maize carried over from last year's bumper harvest, and export orders for
delivery after harvest have been lagging.
The agriculture department put this year's soyabean harvest at 1.902bn
bushels, about 13 per cent smaller than in 1992. Soyabean traders had been
anticipating a figure closer to 1.857bn and are expecting soyabean futures
prices to fall by about 10 cents a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade
today. Soyabean futures for November delivery closed up 10 cents at Dollars
6.83 in anticipation of the report yesterday.
Soyabean prices have been declining in fits and starts since the high of
Dollars 7.56 1/2 on July 19. Traders said any shortfall in the US crop would
be eagerly replaced by Brazilian production, a negative prospect for US soya
farmers.
In a survey of the nine Midwestern states hit hardest by Mississippi and
Missouri river floods, the department said farmers would harvest 145.6m
acres, 7.8m less than expected in June. About 2.8m acres were never planted
because of wet conditions, and about 5m were planted but cannot be
harvested. The agency said production figures were also cut by hot, dry
weather in the US southeast this summer.
Pointing out that the government crop survey was completed last week, Mr
Daniel Basse, analyst at the Chicago research company AgResouces, said: 'The
real focus now will be how many bushels we can add to these figures as we
head into harvest.' Mr Basse said that sultry conditions in the western
maize belt during the past week had been ideal for maize and soyabean
development, but the crops were still racing an early frost and actual
production figures were far from certain.

FT  12 AUG 93 / World Commodities Prices: Wool
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Australian wool prices continued to slip this week, with the market
indicator declining slightly each selling day. Demand was insufficient to
lead to a good clearance at any of the sales and the overall proportion
passed in was nearly 15%. The Wool Corporation's market indicator at 434
cents a kg is now 10 cents below its closing level in June. After a hopeful
opening day the market is again illustrating the inadequacy of demand in
relation to supply. Recession is mentioned as a major cause and the absence
of the old Soviet Union is of even greater basic importance.

FT  12 AUG 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Investors sought for Zimbabwe
diamond mine
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INVESTORS are being asked to provide money for a diamond mine near the River
Limpopo in Zimbabwe, which De Beers, the South African group that dominates
the diamond business, discovered but then let get away.
The mine is River Ranch, 12km upstream from Beitbridge on the southern
border of Zimbabwe. De Beers found diamonds there in 1975 but decided to
concentrate instead on another site 60km away and, importantly, given the
heat generated by the politics of the region, across the border in South
Africa. After an investment of Dollars 500m that site went into production
as Venetia, one of the world's biggest diamond mines.
The South African group eventually gave up its rights to River Ranch in 1991
after it failed to reach agreement with the Zimbabwe government about
marketing the diamonds. The government insists that all minerals are sold
through its state-controlled Minerals Marketing Corporation.
Mr Robin Baxter-Brown, chairman of Redaurum Red Lake Mines, one of the new
joint owners of River Ranch, said yesterday that De Beers bulldozed the site
before leaving.
Also, all documentation about the deposit has mysteriously disappeared from
the Zimbabwe Ministry of Mines.
(A De Beers official said equipment would usually be removed from a site
before it was abandoned but he could neither confirm nor deny that River
Ranch had been bulldozed.)
Mr Baxter-Brown is a South African geologist who started his career with De
Beers and has 36 years of diamond exploration experience. He helped
Auridiam, an Australian-quoted company that he co-founded and where he was
once chairman, win the mining rights to River Ranch when they were put up
for tender by the Zimbabwe government in 1991.
The deposit is estimated by the joint venturers to have resources of 17.5m
tonnes containing 5m carats of diamonds, and since mining started in March
last year it has produced 43,000 carats of diamonds, 60 per cent of them of
gem quality, Mr Baxter-Brown said.
Redaurum, which is quoted in Toronto, is raising CDollars 1.5m (Pounds
780,000) net of expenses via a placing by London stockbrokers Carr Kitcatt &amp;
Aitken to help boost annual output from the present rate of 50,000 carats to
330,000 carats.
The increase will be reached in two phases. The first, costing USDollars
2.1m, will raise output to 180,000 carats next year, while the second will
cost Dollars 8.7m. The partners have spent about Dollars 850,000 to buy and
move a heavy minerals separation plant recently decommissioned at the RTZ
Corporation's diamond mine near Mafikeng, 500km away.
The joint venturers have exclusive exploration rights to 13,474 hectares of
ground around the mine and Mr Baxter-Brown suggested the chances of finding
another diamond deposit were good.
While most of River Ranch's gem diamonds are small, typically under half a
carat, the mine has yielded some big stones, the biggest so far being 29.6
carats. A 28-carat stone was sold for Dollars 110,000 or Dollars 4,000 a
carat, and one of 17 carats for Dollars 95,000 (Dollars 6,000 a carat).
Diamonds are being sold directly to the market in Antwerp, Belgium, and not
through De Beers' Central Selling Organisation, which controls about 80 per
cent of the world rough (uncut) diamond trade. But as Mr Baxter-Brown
pointed out: '330,000 carats a year is no threat to De Beers.'

</HEADLINE>

THE LONDON Commodity Exchange yesterday an-nounced a further concentration
of its effort on core contracts, with a planned expansion of trade in
freight futures, grains and potatoes and the closure of poorly traded meat
and soyameal contracts.
A study by Landell Mills, commodities consultants, highlighted the
international importance of the Biffex freight futures contract and found UK
interest in grain and potato contracts as a hedge against changes resulting
from the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade talks and European Community
farm policy reform.
However, the study saw no prospect of developing the pigmeat, lamb and
soyameal contracts, which have seen minimal trading this year.
The exchange's main contracts will remain cocoa, coffee and white sugar. But
it plans to promote the freight, wheat, barley and potato contracts, which
came with the takeover of the Baltic Futures Exchange in 1990. Freight
futures volume averages 192 lots a day, with wheat and barley at 272 lots
and potatoes just 81.
'We want to get the exchange to be focused - to be a soft commodities and
agricultural exchange,' said Mr Robin Woodhead, chief executive. 'To have a
whole lot of contracts which were illiquid didn't make any sense.'

FT  12 AUG 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: US imports of CIS aluminium
jump
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE WAS a huge increase in US imports of aluminium from the Commonwealth
of Independent States in the first quarter of this year, the US Aluminium
Association said yesterday.
The total jumped from under 16,000 tonnes for the whole of 1992 to nearly
80,000 tonnes in the first three months of this year.
Analysts expect the flow to increase at an even greater rate following the
European Commission's weekend decision to place short-term restrictions on
CIS imports to the Community because of the 'serious damage' being caused to
the European aluminium industry. The CIS material is expected to be diverted
to other markets.
So far the US association, in contrast to other US industries facing foreign
competition, has not been asking the government for protection and has even
argued against quotas. But Mr Paul O'Neill, chairman of Aluminum Company of
America (Alcoa), the world's biggest aluminium producer, hinted on Tuesday
that the US industry's stance might change in the light of the EC
restrictions.
An official pointed out, however, that, because the association had such a
wide variety of members, it would not be easy 'to establish an industry
position'.
The association released the text of a letter it sent to Mr Micky Kantor,
the US trade representative, last week just before the EC took its decision
to act against the CIS.
The letter, signed by Mr David Parker, the association's president, urged
'joint governmental efforts involving the EC, Russia, the US, Canada,
Australia and other important aluminium trading countries'. It said: 'What
is needed is not protectionism but the establishment by governments of rules
of transition which will enable CIS aluminium producers to adapt to the laws
of economics, the established world trading system and to implement modern
environment, health and safety improvements.'
It is understood that, following the association's approach, Mr Rufus Yerxa,
deputy US trade representative, made informal contacts about the issue with
Sir Leon Brittan, EC external economic affairs commissioner, on Friday, just
before the commission decided to impose restrictions.
Ironically, imports of CIS aluminium to the US early this year were boosted
by US producers buying cheap Russian metal to blend with their own. Most of
it was of a quality too low to be sold on the London Metal Exchange.

FT  12 AUG 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Chicago market braces for crop
damage report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   CHICAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE usually hectic Chicago grain futures pits were quiet yesterday as
traders awaited a government report containing the first official estimates
of the US maize and soyabean harvest since a devastating flood hit the
Midwest in July.
The crop figures were also expected to reflect damage in the US southeast,
where a withering drought caused the US Department of Agriculture to declare
farm regions of North Carolina, South Carolina and Georgia disaster areas.
Mr Richard Feltes, analyst for Refco, the international trading company,
said the August report was unusually important this year. 'We've just seen
the largest regional flood disaster since 1947. Usually at this time, we
have production acres fixed, and are just trying to calculate yield. This
time we have two unknown variables, and historic volatility in grains
prices.'
Mr Mike Espy, US secretary of agriculture, was scheduled to speak in
Washington directly after the report, presumably to discuss the disaster aid
legislation President Bill Clinton will sign into law today. Because of the
unusual crop conditions, Mr Espy ordered a broader crop survey than usual
for the August report.
The report, which was scheduled for release after the close of the futures
markets, was expected to put US maize production at about 7.509bn bushels
and soyabeans at about 1.857bn. By comparison, record yields pushed the US
maize crop to 9.479bn last year. US farmers produced 2.197bn bushels of
soyabeans in 1992.
The smaller maize crop must be viewed in the context of large supplies
carried over from last year. With nearly 2.124bn bushels of last year's
harvest still in storage, there is no danger of a feed grain shortage, even
with a smaller maize harvest this year. Soyabean supplies are tighter, with
last year's carryover at only 290m bushels.
Analysts said the USDA's August production estimates would give only a
snapshot of the crop. The USDA survey was completed on August 1. Since then
warm weather has accelerated maize development in Iowa, which was hardest
hit by heavy rain, and in Indiana and Ohio, which have experienced ideal
growing weather this summer.
'The weather rally is far from played out,' said Mr. Steve Assimos, crop
analyst for Cargill Investors Services. 'Iowa and Minnesota are still 1-3
weeks behind schedule, and it won't be until harvest that fears of an early,
killing frost will abate.'
Mr Assimos believed that focus even after the crop data was releases the
market would remain bearish.

FT  12 AUG 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Norway digs deeper for North
Sea riches - The improving prospects for Europe's largest oil producer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN FOSSLI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NORWAY has reached midlife as a petroleum resource nation but the estimated
reserves in its oil fields have been upgraded, thanks to new seismic
acquisition and interpretation technology. The technology has also have
helped identify new fields outside the mature North Sea province.
The Norwegian Petroleum Directorate (NPD), the industry watchdog, upgraded
its estimates of total recoverable petroleum resources by 12 per cent to
between 8bn and 12.5bn tonnes of oil equivalent. At current prices some
estimates put the value of the upgrade at around NKr450bn (Dollars 225bn).
The NPD's estimate puts undiscovered resources at 3.7bn tonnes, the
potential for improved recovery from existing fields at 500m tonnes and
discovered recoverable resources at 5.6bn tonnes.
The oil/gas ratio of potential new resources and improved recovery is
respectively 40 per cent and 60 per cent.
In the past Norwegian petroleum resources have been upgraded by an average
of about 30 per cent from original estimates. Given average annual oil
production of 80m tonnes and annual gas production of 25m tonnes of oil
equivalent, the country's oil will last for about 45 years and its gas for
about 200 years.
Norway is western Europe's biggest crude oil producer, with an annual output
of 2.4m barrels It is the third-biggest supplier of gas.
The continental shelf embraces an estimated 1.1m sq km of sedimentary rocks,
of which just 40 per cent has been opened for exploration drilling. The
shelf is divided into three areas; the North Sea, the Norwegian Sea and the
Barents Sea. The North Sea comprises all areas south of the 62nd parallel,
while the Norwegian Sea extends to intermediate areas between the North Sea
and the Barents Sea, which comprises areas north of Andoeya in the Lofoten
Islands.
The NPD says that on average, every third wildcat well drilled on the shelf
has produced hydrocarbons when tested. In the North Sea, for example, 320
structures have been drilled and 112 discovery wells defined. For the
Norwegian Sea the respective numbers are 70 structures and 17 discoveries,
while in the Barents Sea the figures are respectively 45 and 16.
'During the last five years resource growth has been slightly less than
production growth. Although we can no longer expect to find as much oil as
we produce, good opportunities will still exist for further interesting oil
finds,' the NPD. says
Norway's first licensing round was held in 1965, when 23 production licences
covering 80 blocks were issued, all in water depths of less than 150m in the
southern North Sea. Exploration in recent years has moved into water depths
of 300m and is heading into depths of between 500m and 2,000m.
Drilling technology has advanced to the point where it can meet deep water
challenges, the NPD says.
Norway's first two oil discoveries were made in 1967 and 1968. They were
followed by the discovery of the prolific Ekofisk field, but not until 33
wells were drilled to confirm its commerciality. The NPD likes to tell this
story as a reminder to oil companies thinking of giving up in frustration
with their lack of success in the Barents Sea.
Despite 25 years of intensive North Sea exploration, the NPD believes there
may still be a considerable undiscovered resource potential. In the last few
years several interesting small and medium-sized discoveries have been made
close to existing infrastructure and in reallocated blocks undergoing
renewed exploration.
The NPD estimates that about 25 per cent of total North Sea resources are
still awaiting discovery.
Earlier this year, Saga Petroleum, Norway's biggest independent oil company,
boosted estimates of the amount of oil found in its North Sea Snorre field
by 10 per cent to 890m barrels. Snorre came on stream last autumn and still
faces two further stages of development.
In the Norwegian Sea's Voering Basin, off the coast of mid-Norway and north
of the emerging Haltenbanken oil and gas province, explorers drilled
unsuccessfully for several years before three discoveries were made in
1990-92.
The NPD estimates total Norwegian Sea resources at 1,450m tonnes of oil
equivalent, of which 42 per cent is oil and 58 per cent gas. Its statistical
analysis shows a 95 per cent probability of finding 200m tonnes of petroleum
and a 5 per cent probability of finding 2,200m tonnes.
The recently confirmed Norwegian Sea Norne field, operated by Statoil, the
Norwegian state oil company, is believed to contain an estimated 400m
barrels of oil and the company aims to bring it on stream in 1996.
'The Norne discovery opens up the region's future potential. . . but we
struggled for a long time and drilled two dry wells before we struck oil,'
says Mr Kyrre Nese, Statoil's executive vice-president of exploration and
development. He believes it will take another decade before sufficient
exploration is undertaken in the field to reduce uncertainty over reserves
potential.
On Haltenbanken, Norske Shell recently announced an upgrade of Draugen oil
reserves by 160m barrels to 580m. Draugen is due to come on stream later
this year. Mr Einar Knutsen, a Norske Shell director, says three-dimensional
surveys undertaken in 1991 and 1992 triggered the possibility that Draugen
might contain more oil. 'I would not exclude the possibility of a further
Draugen upgrade,' he says.
Norske Shell is at present undertaking interpretative analysis of 3-D
surveys of two blocks south of Draugen with a view to commencing exploration
drilling next year to define the prospects. Mr Knutsen says that Statoil's
Norne discovery is encouraging news but cautions that the industry will have
to undertake years of drilling to gain sufficient knowledge of the region to
be confident over its resource potential.
'Excluding Norne, there have been no other discoveries in the region,' he
says, adding that his company will concentrate on maximising recovery from
Draugen and defining the prospects of blocks 6411 and 6412.
In the vast Barents Sea, Norway has found gas but made no commercial oil
discoveries. In the Russian part of the Barents Sea, Shtokmanovskoye,
believed to be the world's biggest offshore gas field, was discovered five
years ago. The Russians also found oil there. In mid-August Norske Shell
will drill the only well to be drilled this year in the Norwegian part of
the Barents Sea.
'We have expectations, but this is a crucial well. If it is dry it will mean
Shell has reached a crossroads in its commitment to the Barents Sea,' Mr
Knutsen says.
Mr Nese says the main challenge for Barents Sea explorers is to develop
exploration models that can lead to oil discoveries. 'We know there is
significant gas reserves there and gas marketing efforts are under way, but
the area is far away from gas markets.'
The NPD estimates total resources in the Barents Sea to be 1,380m tonnes of
oil equivalent, of which 14 per cent is oil and 86 per cent gas.

US investment fund liquidation added to downward pressure in the GOLD market
yesterday and the metal's price closed in London at Dollars 375.25 a troy
ounce, down Dollars 3.95 on the day, wiping out what remained of Monday's
rally. The price was still supported at Dollars 374 and then at Dollars 372,
one dealer said, but it was highly unstable in an atmosphere of 'aftershock'
following last week's major price 'correction'. At the London Metal Exchange
a rally in the three months COPPER price met resistance above Dollars 1,900
a tonne and the price closed at Dollars 1,892.50, up Dollars 5 from the
level reached in after hours trading on Tuesday. Dealers said the market
continued to derive support from nearby technical tightness. At the London
Commodity Exchange robusta COFFEE futures closed with losses of up to
Dollars 19 a tonne but held up comparatively well in view of the steep
decline in US prices, dealers said. Heavy speculative selling caused
'complete meltdown' with the New York September position 5.65 cents lower at
69.30 cents a lb in early trading, they said, but concern about short-term
tightness limited losses in the London market.

FT  12 AUG 93 / Government Bonds: Gilts race ahead on back of inflation
forecasts
</HEADLINE>

THE UK government bond market raced ahead on the back of the Bank of
England's inflation forecasts, and even the announcement of Pounds 1.2bn in
new supply failed to dampen the market's high spirits.
The Bank's quarterly report provided welcome news on the inflation front for
the gilt market. The Bank said underlying inflation was likely to stay below
the Treasury's ceiling of 4 per cent over the next two years.
In addition, news of a half-point cut in French interest rates yesterday
morning fuelled hopes of a further cut in the UK base rate. Dealers reported
healthy buying interest from European investors.
The Liffe gilt futures contract rallied from Tuesday's close of 112.01 to
reach a high of 113.05, but ended the day at 112.29.
The market's strength allowed the Bank to sell the remainder of two of the
gilt tranches announced last Friday - a Pounds 1bn tranche of 8.5 per cent
Treasury stock due 2007 and a Pounds 200m tranche of 2.5 per cent
index-linked gilts due 2024.
With both tranches out of the way, the Bank announced a further Pounds 1.2bn
of assorted gilt issues for sale, consisting of: Pounds 200m of 7.25 per
cent bonds due 1998; Pounds 200m of 8 per cent gilts due 2003; Pounds 200m
of 7.75 per cent stock due 2006; Pounds 200m of 8.75 per cent stock due
2017; and Pounds 400m of 2.5 per cent index-linked gilts due 2020.
A HALF-POINT cut in French interest rates, and speculation that other
European central banks would follow suit shortly, helped spur a strong rally
across continental Europe yesterday with the high-yielding markets of Spain
and Italy enjoying the biggest gains.
The Banque de France cut its 24-hour lending rate by 50 basis points to 9.25
per cent, and the prospect of further interest rate cuts pushed the French
bond market to a record high. The September futures contract on the Matif
settled at 122.64, up 0.36.
German government bonds rallied, with the Liffe futures contract rising from
its opening level of 97.38 to reach a high of 97.60 before drifting lower to
close around 97.46.
A SOARING yen coupled with strong domestic demand and strong bond markets in
the US and Europe, provided a boost for the Japanese debt market.
The September futures contract opened at 111.77 and reached a new high of
112.01. Meanwhile, the December futures contract, which has taken over as
the key contract, moved from 111.04 at the opening to reach a high of 111.37
before closing at 111.20.
The yen strengthened to a record Y103.55 to the dollar in London trading,
which economists point out should make it easier for the Bank of Japan to
ease interest rates.
US TREASURIES moved higher yesterday afternoon, recouping their morning
losses after a successful auction of Dollars 11bn in 10-year notes.
Following the auction, the yield of the benchmark 30-year bond set a record
low of 6.43 per cent and remained at that level through the afternoon. In
late trading, the long bond was quoted  1/8 higher at 109 1/16 , yielding
6.433 per cent. At the short end, the two-year note edged  1/32 higher to
yield 4.066 per cent.
Although last week's Dollars 16.67bn three-year note auction was reasonably
successful, the market was nervous ahead of yesterday's auction following
the Treasury's recent decision to reduce the long-bond issue in the last leg
of the quarterly refunding auctions.
The strength of the 10-year note auction was reflected in a record
bid-to-cover ratio of 3.15 to 1. There was no tail and the average yield of
5.78 per cent was the lowest since the regular auction of the issue started
in 1976.

FT  12 AUG 93 / International Bonds: Daily Mail wins tight terms on
convertible
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STRONG expectations of a further cut in UK interest rates, and a buoyant
stock market, enabled the Daily Mail and General Trust, the UK newspaper
group, to secure favourable terms on its fourth bond issue exchangeable into
ordinary shares in Reuters Holdings.
Lead-manager Credit Suisse First Boston said the Daily Mail's Pounds 50m
offering was the first convertible bond issue to carry a coupon of less than
6 per cent. Holders of the 10-year bonds will receive 5 3/4 per cent a year.
The borrower was also able to set a conversion price of Pounds 19.18 for
each share in the international financial information and news group. This
represents a 27.02 per cent premium to shares in Reuters at pricing, well
above the 19 per cent premium set in National Power's Pounds 250m
convertible bond issue last week.
Investors were attracted by the shorter-than-usual maturity of the Daily
Mail's bonds and snapped up the relatively small amount on offer. The bonds
traded at a 1 1/4 point premium to their par issue price in the afternoon.
Reuters shares closed down 19p at Pounds 15.05 against a rising market.
Mr Adrian Perry, the Daily Mail's group treasurer, said this method for
reducing the group's holding in Reuters was the most economical, due to the
potential gain on the share price and the possibility of deferring any tax
liability.
Before yesterday's transaction the Daily Mail had a 3 1/2 per cent stake in
Reuters; it would be left with slightly less than 1 per cent if all
outstanding bonds were converted.
The Daily Mail intends to redeem the outstanding Pounds 14.48m of its 8 1/4
per cent bonds due in 2003, exchangeable into Reuters shares, on September
26.
Abbey National, the UK bank, took advantage of strong Italian bond prices to
raise a further L50bn by re-opening its L150bn seven-year Eurobond offering,
launched on July 30. The high coupon of 10 per cent reflected the call
option on the bonds, lead-manager JP Morgan said.
The net price of the new tranche was 102.30, against a net price of par on
the original amount. The bonds traded around 103 in the afternoon. The funds
were raised for Abbey National's Italian subsidiary. Abbey National also
made a SFr150m three-year bond offering, the proceeds of which were swapped
into dollars.
Bayernhypo, the Bavarian mortgage bank, was the third German bank this week
to borrow D-Marks. The break-even price on its five-year offering was 99.10
and the bonds traded at 99.33 in the afternoon.

FT  12 AUG 93 / International Capital Markets: Seoul still cautious towards
foreign issuers - The slow pace of bond market liberalisation in South Korea
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BURTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF South Korea ever allows foreigners to issue bonds in the domestic market,
foreign brokers there suggest they should be called 'Turtle Bonds'.
The turtle is a symbol of stability to Koreans, but the name was suggested
for a very different reason. 'It represents the slow pace in opening up the
bond market to outsiders,' explains one broker.
The South Korean bond market is the second-biggest in Asia, with a total
market capitalisation of Won95,100bn (Dollars 118bn), exceeding the size of
the country's stock market.
It could offer great potential to foreign investors since domestic interest
rates are high, with guaranteed three-year corporate bonds offering a 13.4
per cent yield, but the government is committed to gradual liberalisation
and refuses unlimited foreign access to the bond market, according to its
recent five-year (1993 - 1997) financial reform plan.
Activity in the bond market is brisk since Korean companies face
restrictions in raising capital abroad.
New corporate bond issues this year may exceed the 1991 peak of Won12,741bn.
Bond issues during the first half of 1993 reached Won8,140bn, a 77 per cent
increase from a year ago. The 10 largest conglomerates, or chaebol, account
for 34 per cent of this year's issues.
But foreigners wanting to acquire chaebol bonds will only be able to do so
indirectly, by buying bond-type beneficiary certificates beginning in 1995.
Instead, the government wants them to purchase bonds issued by small and
medium businesses as part of its strategy to promote the restructuring of
industry, now dominated by the chaebol.
Foreigners will be allowed to buy convertible bonds issued by small and
medium companies next year, although they may face restrictions on the
amount purchased. In 1997, unguaranteed, long-term bonds issued by small
companies will be open to direct foreign investment.
From next year, foreigners will also be allowed to purchase some government
and public bonds in the primary market. But these bonds will pay less
interest than prevailing rates in the domestic market since they will be
pegged to lower international rates.
Government bonds account for 15.7 per cent of the market, with the state
planning to issue Won11,000bn this year, against Won8,548bn in 1992.
Corporate bonds represent 32.7 per cent, financial bonds 28 per cent, and
monetary stabilisation bonds, used to soak up excess liquidity in the money
markets, 15.6 per cent.
International organisations, such as the Asian Development Bank and the
World Bank, will be the first foreign entities allowed to float
Won-dominated bonds on the domestic market, beginning in 1995.
The government claims the reforms represent progress in liberalising the
market but foreign brokers are more sceptical, noting several problems.
Government bonds with lower international yields may not attract much
interest since they will deprive foreigners of the returns promised by
higher domestic rates.
The lack of credit analysis of small and medium companies may also
discourage foreign investors, particularly in unguaranteed long-term bonds.
That problem, however, may be partly resolved through bond portfolio funds,
which could spread risk.
The rationale for government caution is that a rapid opening of the market
could lead to higher inflation and a rise in the value of the Won.
'The complete opening of the bond market to foreign investors will only
occur when the government is willing to accept full liberalisation of
foreign exchange controls,' said Mr Edward Kim of Korea Development
Securities.
Government anxiety about the effects of foreign capital inflows into South
Korea have side-tracked promised attempts to deregulate the state-controlled
financial system.
However, there is optimism that the changes will be introduced on schedule
this time because the government is implementing measures to prepare the
bond market for foreign investors.
It is seeking to improve the market's infrastructure by encouraging
secondary trading on the Korea stock exchange rather than on the
over-the-counter market, which accounted for 98.8 per cent of the
Won915,771bn in bond trading volume in 1992. An initial step will be a
prohibition on the trading of convertible bonds outside the KSE.
In addition, the Korea Securities Dealers Association has recently
established a computerised system to provide traders with information on
bond prices and yields.

FT  12 AUG 93 / International Company News: Insurance group ahead in spite
of Dollars 23m charge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE EQUITABLE, the US insurer 49 per cent-owned by Axa of France, moved
further into profit in the second quarter, in spite of a Dollars 23m
after-tax restructuring charge.
Net income at the group, which reported losses between 1990 and 1992, rose
to Dollars 72m, compared with Dollars 31.8m in the first quarter and a loss
of Dollars 31.1m a year ago.
The core insurance business made an after-tax profit of Dollars 33m - before
investment gains and losses on disability insurance - compared with a
Dollars 21m net profit in the first three months.
The company attributed the improvement to lower expenses, wider product
spreads and improved mortality experience.
After losses from disability insurance of Dollars 19.5m (Dollars 10.4m a
year ago) and investment gains of Dollars 5.3m (an Dollars 11.3m loss in the
1992 quarter), net profit was Dollars 18.7m, compared with a Dollars 44.9m
loss the year before.
The company's investment management arm and its investment bank, Donaldson
Lufkin &amp; Jenrette, both advanced, before the restructuring charge related to
the combination of The Equitable and Alliance investment management
businesses.
'Earnings from this segment during the second half should benefit from the
absence of non-recurring merger expenses, significant cost savings generated
by The Equitable Capital/Alliance combination, as well as from anticipated
strong asset growth at Alliance,' said Mr Richard Jenrette, chairman and
chief executive.
Yield on investments climbed during the quarter to 7.64 per cent from 7.5
per cent, as real estate yields rose and the group moved into longer-dated
bonds.
Half-year net income was Dollars 79.3m, or 37 cents a share fully diluted,
compared with a loss of Dollars 22.5m a year earlier (before costs
associated with its switch from a mutual organisation to a public company).

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BORAL, the Australian industrial products company, plans to float its
manufacturing division by the end of 1993.
Mr Jim Leslie, chairman, said yesterday he expected the proceeds to
substantially exceed the book value of the division's assets.
The balance sheet asset valuation of Boral's manufacturing division at June
1992 was ADollars 336.7m (USDollars 230.8m), but this included the
engineering and tyre divisions which will not be part of the sale.
Mr Leslie said the move follows a corporate restructuring completed in July.
He added that Boral intended to focus on its core building products and
energy businesses.
The manufacturing businesses had combined sales of ADollars 280m in
1991-1992 and earnings before interest and tax of ADollars 32.8m.
Mr Leslie said Boral was well advanced with the float plan, although a
corporate sale remained an option.
The division includes some leading brands including Gerrard springs,
Kinnears ropes and Cyclone hardware, with operations in Australia, New
Zealand and Singapore.
Mr Leslie said Boral would release its 1992-1993 corporate results on
September 1 and he expected the 12.7 per cent increase in net earnings for
the December half to be exceeded for the full year.

FT  12 AUG 93 / International Company News: Court approves TWA plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRANS World Airlines, the US carrier, yesterday won approval from a Delaware
bankruptcy court for its 'plan of reorganisation' after a day of hearings.
This should allow the company to emerge from Chapter 11 bankruptcy
protection within the next few weeks.
TWA entered bankruptcy in early 1992, when the company was still owned by Mr
Carl Icahn, the US financier.
Mr Glenn Zander, one of two co-chief executives at TWA, told the court that
the airline's performance was consistent with projections contained in its
reorganisation plan, and claimed that the airline would be viable if it
returned from bankruptcy.
The carrier has yet to decide where it would base its ongoing operations;
TWA has been operating from Mount Kisco, New York, where Mr Icahn's other
business interests are based.
Under the reorganisation, equity ownership would be split between employees,
in return for wage concessions, and creditors, in exchange for debt
forgiveness.
USAir, in which British Airways holds a minority stake, is acquiring five
gates at Orlando airport in Florida from United Airlines, the larger
Chicago-based carrier. USAir added that it planned to enter an agreement
with United, under which the two carriers would provide code-sharing flights
from areas in the north-eastern US to Miami, and then on to Latin America.

telecoms industry
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR DAN AKERSON, president of MCI, the US's second-biggest long-distance
telephone company, is leaving to head General Instrument, a maker of
transmission equipment for cable television with a market value of nearly
Dollars 4bn.
He will also become a general partner in the leveraged buy-out firm of
Forstmann Little, which took control of General Instrument in 1990.
Mr Akerson, 44, was made president and chief operating officer of MCI only
last year. He had won the support of Wall Street for his hard-driving
attitude, and for the agreement in June to bring in British
Telecommunications as a 20 per cent shareholder in MCI.
Mr Akerson said he had not been looking to leave MCI, but had been drawn
away by the opportunity to lead General Instrument as it develops in the
field of interactive media.
Mr Bert Roberts, MCI's chairman and chief executive, added that the
financial package had also tempted Mr Akerson away. His new remuneration was
not disclosed, but last year his salary and bonus at MCI came to Dollars
830,000, and he was given restricted stock in the company worth another
Dollars 790,000 and options over 46,000 shares.
Analysts said that the departure resulted in part from the fact that Mr
Akerson's path to the top at MCI was blocked by the 51-year-old Mr Roberts.
Both men denied there had been any disagreement over strategy. MCI, which
was notified of Mr Akerson's intention to leave only on Tuesday, said it had
not yet decided whether to replace him, or whether to take the opportunity
to reorganise management.
General Instrument said Mr Donald Rumsfeld, 61, a former US defence
secretary, would step down as chairman and chief executive after Mr Akerson
joins the company at the end of August, but would remain a director.
MCI shares fell on the news but later recovered to close at Dollars 28 1/4 ,
up Dollars  5/8 on the day. General Instrument's shares lost Dollars 2, to
Dollars 47.
McCaw Cellular Communications and PacTel, a unit of Pacific Telesis Group,
have received regulatory approval to combine their interests in San
Francisco, San Jose, Dallas, and Kansas City, and Kansas, into a 99-year
joint venture.
McCaw and PacTel said they would each have equal ownership of the venture.

6bn Medco takeover

<TEXT>
TWO CLASS actions have been launched in an attempt to block the proposed
Dollars 6bn takeover of Medco Containment Services, the US's biggest drugs
distributor, by Merck, the pharmaceuticals company.
The actions, launched in Delaware on behalf of Medco shareholders, allege
'various violations of fiduciary duty, including failure to make adequate
disclosures, failure to explore adequately other forms of business alliance,
improper fees payable to certain executive officers and unfairness in the
structure of the merger,' Medco said.
Mr Martin Wygod, Medco's chairman, will personally receive a fee on the
consummation of the deal equal to 1 per cent of the value, or Dollars 60m,
an arrangement which was approved by Medco's board.
Medco also said it and several other pharmaceutical companies and drug
wholesalers faced legal action in California alleging price discrimination.
It said it intended to defend all the suits vigorously, and that it did not
believe any of them would have a material adverse impact on its business.

stores

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CONTRASTING fortunes in the US stores sector continued to surface yesterday
when Woolworth, the large general merchandise and specialty store chain
retailer, reported slim earnings of Dollars 2m after tax in the second
quarter.
Federated Department Stores, however, saw results for the same quarter swing
from a loss to profit.
Woolworth's Dollars 2m net profit in the three months to end-July compared
with a Dollars 33m surplus in the same period of 1992, and was reached on
sales of Dollars 2.28bn, little changed from last time's Dollars 2.23bn.
The result took earnings for the first half to Dollars 3m after tax,
compared with Dollars 50m at the same stage in 1992-93.
The sources of Woolworth's second-quarter decline were the general
merchandise and specialty stores. The former posted an operating loss of
Dollars 4m, against a Dollars 21m profit a year ago, with sales declining by
1.2 per cent.
Specialty stores remained profitable at the operating level, but saw a
decline from Dollars 67m to Dollars 37m. Sales rose by 7.4 per cent.
Yesterday, Woolworth painted a dismal picture for the remainder of the year.
'Weak economic conditions and low consumer confidence in the major markets
in which we do business continue to depress sales and gross margins, making
it unlikely that there will be a year-to-year increase in earnings,' said Mr
William Lavin, chairman.
By contrast, Federated Department Stores, which emerged from bankruptcy in
early 1992, reported an Dollars 8.9m profit after tax in the second quarter,
up from a Dollars 15.8m loss (before extraordinary items) in the same period
last time.
Sales rose from Dollars 1.46bn to Dollars 1.5bn, and profits after tax but
before extraordinary items for the first six months now stand at Dollars
30.6m, compared with last time's Dollars 4m loss.
Federated said that it had 'slightly' exceeded profit expectations in the
quarter and first half, and attributed this to 'fresher inventories, better
merchandise assortments, improved expense controls and enhanced operating
efficiencies'.
Mr Allen Questrom, chairman, noted that the company had continued to take
extra second-quarter discounts in merchandise in order to keep goods in the
stores looking 'fashion-current'.
He added that Federated had been able to offset the earnings effect of this
by expense reductions, but stressed the rate at which the expense-to-sales
ratio was improving was unlikely to continue through the autumn season.

ST Lawrence Cement, controlled by the Swiss Holderbank group, continued to
be affected by the recession and slowdown in eastern Canada construction.
Second-quarter net profit was CDollars 505,000 (USDollars 391,000), or 1
cent a share, against a loss of CDollars 4.4m, or 10 cents a share, a year
earlier, on sales of CDollars 131.5m, up 3.8 per cent. The first-half loss
was CDollars 13.8m, or 32 cents, a 30 per cent improvement on the CDollars
19.7m loss a year earlier. Sales were CDollars 189m, up 5.2 per cent.
St Lawrence, eastern Canada's biggest cement producer and a leading supplier
in the north-eastern US, has cut costs 10 per cent this year.
'The outlook is more encouraging than at the start of the year,' said senior
vice-president Mr Guy Turgeon, 'and rationalisation will contribute to
improving results.'

fall

<TEXT>
PALABORA Mining, the copper producer in the RTZ group, saw net profits fall
to R88.7m (Dollars 26.3m) in the six months to June from R106.8m in the same
period of 1992. The result was, however, higher than forecast.
Turnover at the north-eastern Transvaal mine fell to R520.4m from R534.4m
and operating profit was 20 per cent lower at R161.4m, against R202.1m. Net
profit was boosted by a R10.6m extraordinary item, the result of tax
changes. The 1992 results included a similar figure.
The company said the results were affected by reduced sales of copper
cathodes, due to lower production, offset partly by a slightly weaker rand.
The average copper price for the year to date was R6,692 per tonne, compared
with the 1992 level of R6,434 per tonne.
Lower production was due to reduced ore grades and inventory movements.
Copper sold, including metal in concentrates, was 59,492 tonnes, 10,077
tonnes below last year's sales of 69,569 tonnes for the same period.
The company is looking at whether it will be feasible to operate an
underground mine when the open pit life comes to an end after the turn of
the century. The study is due to be completed in 1994.

<TEXT>
SUN International Bophut-atswana (Sunbop), the South African hotel, leisure
and gaming group, maintained earnings at 192 cents per share in the year to
June against a backdrop of difficult trading conditions.
The results include seven months' performance from the Lost City
development, completed last year at a cost of about R830m (Dollars 246m) and
, for the first time, a full year's income from the Carousel entertainment
complex.
All of Sunbop's hotels and gaming facilities, which include the Sun City
resort, are in the Bophutatswana homeland.
Turnover for the year rose by 18 per cent to R1.18bn and operating profit
was 11 per cent higher at R299.1m, against R270.2m. The financing of the
Lost City project, however, caused the interest bill to jump from virtually
nothing in 1992 to R30.3m. As a result, pre-tax profit fell slightly to
R268m from R270m. A lower tax bill helped attributable profit rise by 6 per
cent to R228m.
The dividend was maintained at 132 cents per share on earnings of 192 cents,
compared with 191 cents.
Mr Sol Kerzner, chairman, said that despite the 'extremely poor trading
environment, aggravated by socio-political unrest and competition from
illegal casinos in South Africa', the group had managed an average occupancy
rate of 70 per cent.
This is below the 73 per cent achieved in 1992, but still well above levels
its competitors are achieving. Occupancy at the new Palace hotel has
averaged 75 per cent since opening.
Mr Kerzner said predictions were difficult in the current climate, but he
expected earnings in 1994 to at least match those of the past year.

CANADIAN Pacific yesterday sold its 61 per cent stake in Canadian Pacific
Forest Products, leaving another big Canadian forestry company without a
controlling shareholder.
CP raised CDollars 698m (USDollars 545.3m) by selling its 36.7m CP Forest
shares to a group of Canadian securities dealers for CDollars 19 per share,
payable in three instalments over the next two years. The underwriters
immediately offered the shares to the public.
An official at Nesbitt Thomson, which led the group, said yesterday that the
shares were 'very well received'. Mr William Stinson, CP chairman, said that
forest products 'no longer fit our core business strategy'. He said that
while CP Forest will benefit from economic recovery, 'we believe that its
markets will remain cyclical and we've decided to realise cash now'.
CP has indicated that it would concentrate on its rail, energy and property
interests. It is expected also to reduce its 47 per cent stake in Laidlaw,
the waste and transport services operator.
'We believe that the best way to grow and to create value is to put our
capital to work in fewer businesses,' Mr Stinson said. Proceeds from the CP
Forest sale will go towards reducing CP's debt.
Other Canadian pulp and paper producers which have recently been spun off by
controlling shareholders include MacMillan Bloedel, which was part of the
Bronfman group, and Quno, previously owned by the Chicago Tribune. Several
other divestments are planned.
CP Forest is one of North America's biggest newsprint producers and also a
large producer of market pulp and construction timber. It suffered a
CDollars 113m loss on sales of CDollars 941m in the first half of 1993.
The company has spent more than USDollars 1bn over five years to modernise
its Canadian mills. It recently raised CDollars 230m in cash by spinning off
its western Canadian wood products operation into a publicly-held company.
CP Forest shares fell CDollars 1.62 to close at CDollars 18.85 on the
Toronto stock exchange yesterday. Canadian Pacific dropped 25 cents to
CDollars 21.50.

FT  12 AUG 93 / International Company News: Japanese consumers are now
looking for value - Emiko Terazono finds spending patterns changing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Higuchi, president of Kawachiya, one of Japan's first liquor discount
retailers, says his warehouse-like stores get so crowded at weekends that he
has to close the shutters.
Kawachiya's success is an example of the change in consumer attitudes as the
downturn in the Japanese economy has hit the purses of ordinary Japanese.
The burst of the asset bubble of the late 1980s and the spate of corporate
restructurings have sobered consumers, who are going back to basics. Boxes
of beers and bottles of whisky at a 30 per cent discount to the normal
retail price have an obvious attraction.
Department store sales have dropped sharply as consumers' spending has
turned towards value-orientated products. Department store sales fell a
record 8.9 per cent in June, slipping for the 16th consecutive month.
On the other hand, sales and profits at discount retailers have surged.
Kawachiya, which is unlisted, says its sales have grown by about 30 per cent
for the past three years, and expects annual sales to double this year to
Y15bn (Dollars 143m) due to the launch of new stores.
Analysts predict that such changes in consumer spending patterns are here to
stay. Mr Paul Heaton at Baring Securities in Tokyo says: 'Even if the
economy recovers, consumers won't be going back to department stores.' Until
the mid-1980s, cheap prices meant poor quality while buying expensive goods
at department stores has been a guarantee for quality and service.
Japanese consumers are given choice of buying quality goods at discount
prices without the frills. Aoyama Trading, which offers office workers'
uniform blue suits at one-third of the price of department stores, has seen
profits surge, posting a 11.8 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Y30.2bn
for the year to last March on a 29.3 per cent increase in sales to Y150.9bn.
For the year to next March, it predicts a 15.8 per cent rise in pre-tax
profits and a 29.2 per cent sales increase.
A recent survey by the Nikkei business daily indicated that 80 per cent of
115 consumers surveyed bought electric appliances at special-ty discount
retailers and none went to department stores.
The country's discount retailers have also received a boost from stricter
enforcement of the anti-monopoly law by the Fair Trade Commission, the
anti-monopoly watchdog. Japanese manufacturers have traditionally had a
tight grip on retail prices, often threatening to stop shipments if the
retailer failed to apply the 'suggested retail price' set by the
manufacturer.
However, in 1990 the FTC set strict guidelines against price control and
discount retailers have since acquired the mainstream image. 'I received
death threats and was boycotted by distributors when I started discounting
liquor,' recalls Mr Higuchi.
Japanese beer companies announced that retailers were free to set their own
prices in 1990. Earlier this year, sales subsidiaries of leading electronics
companies, including Matsushita Electric Industrial and Sony, were warned to
allow retailers to discount their products without fear of losing supply
contracts.
Last year, last year took a pharmaceutical company, which cut shipments
after Kawachiya started discounting its pep drink, to the FTC. Last week, he
filed a complaint with the commission that Shiseido, a leading cosmetics
company, had cancelled its contract after he had rejected Shiseido's pleas
to stop discounting its luxury brands. The cosmetics maker says shipments to
Kawachiya were cancelled because the retailer had been wholesaling Shiseido
products.
Mr Higuchi reckons there is further scope for discount retailers to grow as
an increasing number of Japanese consumers become value orientated. But he
adds consumers need to be given choice, and the country's distribution
system has to adapt to changing values. 'Where else are consumers made to
pay extra to support distributors and small retailers?' he asks.

FT  12 AUG 93 / International Company News: Schering shares soar on MS drug
boost
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
SHARES Schering, the German chemicals and pharmaceuticals group, rose
sharply yesterday on news that its new drug to treat sufferers of multiple
sclerosis would yield higher revenues than expected.
The share price rose by DM54, or 6 per cent, to DM926.
The MS drug, Betaseron, was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration
at the end of last month, a move which also pushed up the shares. Mr Klaus
Pohle, Schering finance director, said in New York on Monday that the drug
should yield between Dollars 8,500 and Dollars 10,000 per patient a year;
the figure had been put at around half this.
Mr Pohle said Betaseron should produce similar revenues in Europe, where it
hoped for approval in 1995.
Analysts reckoned Betaseron could produce revenues of more than DM1bn
(Dollars 500m) a year within five years. Mr Mark Tracey, European chemicals
analyst at the London office of Goldman Sachs, said actual Betaseron
revenues would probably average up to Dollars 7,500 a patient after price
discounting in the US health service.
He said European revenues could be around Dollars 6,000 per person. In the
US, he said Betaseron could be used to treat nearly 90,000 MS patients out
of a total of more than 250,000, the figure in Europe being 105,000 out of
more than 300,000.

FOREIGN exchange losses marred the first-half performance of Novo Nordisk,
the pharmaceuticals and enzymes manufacturer. Pre-tax profits fell by 16 per
cent to DKr788m (Dollars 113.34m) from DKr941m in the same period last year.
Sales advanced 6 per cent to DKr5.73bn from DKr5.38bn, while profits before
financial items were down by 3 per cent to DKr864m from DKr887m, according
to the group's first-half interim statement.
But DKr160m in foreign exchange losses contributed to converting net
financial income of DKr54m last year to a net loss this year of DKr74m.
With estimated corporate income tax down by 34 per cent, however, net
profits fell by 8 per cent to DKr595m from DKr649m. Earnings per share were
down to DKr15.87 from DKr17.42.
The pre-tax profit figure was in line with expectations by Copenhagen
brokers.

FT  12 AUG 93 / International Company News: SKF doubles losses but sees
improvement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SKF, the world's leading roller bearing manufacturer, said yesterday that
losses more than doubled in the first six months, but it noted that its
performance had started to improve following rationalisation.
The group's loss after financial items for the period was SKr469m (Dollars
58.66m), which was smaller than expected, compared with a SKr194m deficit in
the first half of 1992.
Sales rose to SKr14.53bn from SKr14.04bn, but adjusted for currency
movements and disposals they were down 8 per cent.
The group said its second-quarter loss fell to SKr114m from SKr355m in the
first quarter due to the drive to cut costs which it launched in 1990. For
the same reason, it expects its second-half results to be better than in the
first half - providing there is no further deterioration in its markets.
The first-half operating loss of SKr66m was aggravated by financial costs of
SKr403m, due to the depreciation of the krona and a SKr55m currency exchange
loss. In the same 1992 period, the operating loss was SKr46m and financial
expenses SKr148m.
The group's main bearings and seals business, which depends on the health of
the car and engineering industries, recorded a loss of SKr251m, after a
first-half 1992 profit of SKr156m.
SKF fears the market may not have bottomed in this sector, even though
volumes have remained unchanged for the last three quarters. 'The situation
is still fragile,' said a spokesman, who highlighted the group's exposure to
the recession-hit German market.
Weak industrial output in both Germany and France meant SKF recorded a loss
of SKr440m in these markets in the first half.
The outlook in other markets is brighter, however. In North America,
earnings and volumes picked up during the second quarter, while sales in
central and South America and Asia Pacific also develop-ed.
The company's other main business, Ovako Steel, managed to cut losses to
SKr224m from SKr319m amid signs that the demand for special steel products
was bottoming out and prices stabilising at low levels.
As part of its rationalisation programme, SKF has cut staff by 12,400 since
1990, reduced production by 20 to 25 per cent in response to lower demand,
and cut inventory levels by SKr2bn. The payroll has been reduced by 2,000 to
43,000 so far this year.
The company's shares rose SKr3 to close at SKr115 yesterday.

FT  12 AUG 93 / International Company News: Hoogovens cost-cutting takes
effect
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RONALD VAN DE KROL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   IJMUIDEN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FIRST-HALF losses at Hoogovens, the Dutch steel and aluminium group, fell
sharply compared with the last six months of 1992, as cost-cutting measures
started to take effect in the steel sector.
The improvement came despite continued difficulties in aluminium, where
Hoogovens is being hit by cheap imports from the former Soviet Union.
Losses including extraordinary items were Fl 189m (Dollars 97m), up from Fl
49m a year earlier but down from Fl 546m in the 1992 second half. The
company had previously predicted that the net loss excluding extraordinary
items would be unchanged from the last six months of 1992.
Extraordinary charges were Fl 25m compared with Fl 363m in the 1992 second
half. Turnover was down 9.5 per cent at Fl 3.5bn.
In its first forecast for the second half, Hoogovens said losses on normal
business operations would fall even though aluminium was unlikely to
improve.
The news sent the company's shares - which have surged recently along with
other cyclical Dutch shares - up Fl 4.80 to close more than 10 per cent
higher at Fl 51.30.
Losses in steel, before tax or extraordinaries, were more than halved to Fl
70m from Fl 158m in the 1992 second half but were down only slightly from Fl
76m in the 1992 first half.
Mr Maarten van Veen, chairman, said Hoogovens was one of the few leading
European steel groups to have raised steel output. But the product mix had
also shifted in favour of lower-margin semi-finished steel.
The company said yesterday that it planned to raise prices for finished
steel in October and January, on top of increases in April and July.
Nevertheless, prices remained well below their 1991 peak.

GPA Group, the Republic of Ireland-based aircraft leasing company taken over
by GE Capital, the financial services arm of General Electric of the US, is
to lay off more than 20 per cent of its 230-strong workforce.
The company said that many of the near-50 redundancies would be compulsory.
They were part of a general restructuring following the takeover and were
necessary to 'take account of current and anticipated levels of business.'
GPA, which has been experiencing difficulties since the collapse of a Stock

FT  12 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Usborne plans expansion via Pounds 4.6m
rights
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Usborne is raising Pounds 4.64m net through a rights issue to strengthen and
expand its core activities of grain merchanting and pig production and
marketing.
Accompanying the funding details is a forecast for the 18 months to June 30,
putting pre-tax profit on at least Pounds 1.57m, after write-downs, against
losses of Pounds 4.12m for the 1991 year.
Shareholders will be offered 26.2m shares on a 2-for-5 basis at 19p. The
shares were unchanged yesterday at 25p.
The majority of the rights proceeds will provide additional working capital
to support geographical and product expansion, particularly during the peak
autumn and winter periods when grain purchases were made for storage.
The balance will go partially to refinancing the Pounds 1.75m initial
consideration paid in a recent deal with Unigate. Under that Usborne
expanded its pig stocks through the Pounds 5.25m purchase of a substantial
portion of Unigate's outdoor reared pigs.
Usborne will supply Unigate with pigs for bacon processing over a six and a
half year period on terms that allow it a fixed margin over costs.
The forecast profit takes into account a property write-down of Pounds
1.31m. The final dividend is expected to be 0.4p on increased capital, to
make 0.8p for the period (0.4p for previous year).

FT  12 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Sibelco raises stake in Watts Blake to
45.7%
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SIBELCO, the private Belgian company embroiled in a hostile bid for Watts
Blake Bearne, yesterday purchased 14.8 per cent of its target's shares from
concert party partner Quarzwerke of Germany.
The purchase leaves Sibelco with control over 45.7 per cent of the world's
largest ball clay producer, following the 0.6 per cent acceptances announced
last week.
Sibelco has offered shareholders 420p a share or the option of taking loan
notes instead of cash. Quarzwerke had backed the bid from inception and had
already agreed to sell its shares at 420p to Sibelco before the end of 1994.
The German company will take a deferred consideration, similar to the loan
note offer, payable on September 30 1994.
Sibelco's bid was triggered by the decision of Ceramics Holdings, a third
concert party partner, to sell its 15.6 per cent stake.
The three, who between them held 45 per cent of WBB, had agreed that if one
party wanted to sell and the others failed to buy, the whole stake would be
put up for sale. When buyers failed to come forward after several months,
Sibelco decided to add Ceramics' stake to its own 14.8 per cent holding,
triggering a mandatory bid under the Takeover Code.

FT  12 AUG 93 / UK Company News: H&amp;C sells Malaysian quote
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HARRISONS &amp; Crosfield, the agribusiness, chemicals and plantations group,
will gain more than Pounds 5m by selling the quotation of its Malaysian
rubber business.
In a complex deal announced yesterday, Harrisons is selling its 51 per cent
stake in Linatex for MDollars 5.25 per share, or about Pounds 14.7m, to
Phileo Assets of Malaysia.
The sale will be subject to Linatex, which produces rubber for industrial
use, selling all its assets and business to Harrisons for Pounds 10.2m.
Other conditions include regulatory and minority shareholder approval.
Under Malaysian regulations, Harrisons will eventually have to find a local
partner to take a minority stake in Linatex. Mr Graham Wickenden, group
finance executive, said that in previous cases in Malaysia a minority stake
was between 25 and 30 per cent. Based on the price paid by Harrisons, the
group will gain a further Pounds 2.5m to Pounds 3m on the sale of the
minority.
Phileo Assets intends to use the Linatex quote to take over Phileo Peregrine
Securities, an Ipoh-based stockbroker which is 30 per cent owned by Hong
Kong's Peregrine Group.
The move comes amid heavy trading in shell companies on the Kuala Lumpur
stock exchange over the last six months as businesses seek funds for
expansion. A recent report from Morgan Grenfell Asia shows that shell
companies are trading at a premium of between MDollars 40m and MDollars 50m
above net tangible asset value. Mr Wickenden said the Phileo offer was
pitched at MDollars 70m above the NTA of Linatex, placing the deal in the
top quartile of deals done to date.

REFLEX GROUP, the Dublin-based computer services and software combine,
returned to profit in the first half following two years of pre-tax losses.
The group, which has been switching from computer leasing to provision of
applications software and persuaded Mr Tony Kilduff to come in as chairman
last year, reported pre-tax profits of IPounds 316,000 (Pounds 293,000) in
the six months to June 30.
In the previous eight months to December 31 the group incurred a pre-tax
loss of IPounds 4.53m, including IPounds 3.07m of provisions for
discontinued operations, other exceptional costs and goodwill on
discontinued operations previously written off to reserves.
Turnover from continuing operations increased by 23 per cent to IPounds
4.28m against IPounds 3.45m when discontinued operations added another
IPounds 2.13m.
The group incurred a IPounds 1.45m operating loss including IPounds 470,000
on discontinued operations.
Mr Kilduff attributed the turnround to continued tight control of costs and
the withdrawal from the lossmaking hardware sales activity in the UK,
coupled with a successful performance of the UK computer services
businesses.
Earnings per share were 2.01p in the first half, compared with a loss on
continuing operations of 7.98p in the previous eight months and total losses
of 26.85p.

REFLEX GROUP, the Dublin-based computer services and software combine,
returned to profit in the first half following two years of pre-tax losses.
The group, which has been switching from computer leasing to provision of
applications software and persuaded Mr Tony Kilduff to come in as chairman
last year, reported pre-tax profits of IPounds 316,000 (Pounds 293,000) in
the six months to June 30.
In the previous eight months to December 31 the group incurred a pre-tax
loss of IPounds 4.53m, including IPounds 3.07m of provisions for
discontinued operations, other exceptional costs and goodwill on
discontinued operations previously written off to reserves.
Turnover from continuing operations increased by 23 per cent to IPounds
4.28m from IPounds 3.45m in the previous period when discontinued operations
added another IPounds 2.13m. The group incurred a IPounds 1.45m operating
loss including IPounds 470,000 on discontinued operations.
Mr Kilduff attributed the turnround to continued tight control of costs and
the withdrawal from the loss-making hardware sales activity in the UK,
coupled with a successful performance of the UK computer services businesses
and lower interest costs resulting from reduced debt levels and interest
rates.
He said the introduction of the group's application software products in the
UK required continued investment but was expected to contribute to
profitability in the second half.
Mr Aidan Farrell, chief executive, said that during the latest period 41 per
cent of the group's gross margin was earned from the licensing and support
of application software products, compared to 21 per cent last year. The
remainder was generated by computing services activities. Overall the Irish
market generated 49 per cent of gross margin with the UK accounting for the
rest.
At the end of June the group had net debt of IPounds 2.69m, down IPounds
700,000 since the end of the year. Its residual book of leases continued to
be run off and the balance sheet at the end of June included IPounds 1.2m of
assets related to discontinued leasing activities, down from IPounds 1.7m at
the year end.
Continuing cash flow from these leasing assets, together with cash from
operations will contribute to a further 'significant' reduction in debt
during the second half.
Earnings per share were 2.01p in the first half, compared to a loss on
continuing operations of 7.98p in the previous eight months and total losses
of 26.85p.

FT  12 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Market minnow with a touch of individuality
 -How the benefits of a restructuring programme are showing through at
Linread
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LINREAD, the Midlands-based maker of fasteners largely for the motor and
aerospace industries, is restructuring to create the robustness which the
Bank of England has found to be a characteristic of UK manufacturers as they
come out of recession.
It is in the middle of a programme which is already having a marked effect
on the speed and cost at which fasteners come out of its plants in
Birmingham, Redditch, Leicester and, in north-east England, Peterlee.
The programme is typical of what has been taking place in the Midlands
manufacturing sector. Increases in productivity at big and small companies
alike have fed the market hope that engineering companies are good recovery
stocks.
Hence the rise in the FT-A Metals and Metal Forming Index from the year's
low point last January of 319.37 to current levels of about 460. Hence too,
at 2.38 per cent, the relatively low dividend yield for the sector.
Within the sector, Linread's share price has been trading latterly within
reach of its 1993 high of 128p. But, with a market value of just over Pounds
14m, it is a market minnow. The price is of general interest only because it
reflects a trend: Glynwed, with a market value 45 times greater, has also
seen its price near its 1993 high and has the highest p/e in the sector at
29.
Although Linread's programme is typical in its objectives and does not claim
to be original in content, its timing is individual. Glynwed started
responding to recession in 1990, when it began to reduce its payroll. The
full force of the Linread programme became apparent only last year and will
not be fully effective until the end of 1993. It is, then, late in the
economic cycle.
This reflected internal circumstances. Linread seemed just like any
moderately successful small manufacturer until 1991, when a breakdown in
stock controls led not only to losses but also to a management shakeout
which saw the arrival in early 1992 of Mr Peter Harrisson as chief
executive.
Mr Harrisson then set off his own changes. There will be two new managing
directors for the main operating divisions by September. New people have
come in to the tier underneath, making immediate impact at the operational
level.
Such changes have become a general phenomenon as managements have sought to
tweak the processes, manage the cash, to do more with less. Responsibilities
have generally been more closely defined. Glynwed has already done what
Linread is now doing: a new generation of executives has been put in place
at the top of its main operating divisions.
Although, at Linread, detailed practice differs from plant to plant, its
internal changes have broad similarities. Factory lay-outs are changing from
a division of space by function - all the grinding machines together, for
example - to a division of space according to product. Manufacturing teams
are being set up.
The old system meant that there was always a large amount of work in
progress and that management found it difficult to trace bottlenecks. Lead
times were long. The biggest problem for the group was the traditional
British bugbear: an inability to deliver on time.
At North Bridge Fasteners, a Leicester subsidiary specialising in aero
engine bolts, the average lead time for production was 10 weeks, much of
which was taken up by half-made products queueing up, waiting for attention.
The lead time has been reduced now to three weeks, the work in progress has
been cut by 65 per cent and the distance a part travels around the shop has
been cut by 70 per cent.
Group pre-tax profits have returned: Pounds 1.3m in 1992. There was a quick
effect on the balance sheet once stock and work in progress came out of the
system. 'We took cash out of the factories and put it into the bank
balance,' said Mr Harrisson.
The Bank of England noted that companies entered the 1990s recession with a
higher level of indebtedness than they had had in the 1980s downturn.
Linread has been no exception in the recent attention it has given to
gearing. During 1992, it halved gearing from 59 to 29 per cent and it is now
reducing further.
Companies are seeking the greater financial flexibility which comes from
higher productivity. Just as Glynwed's sales per employee have risen since
the end of 1991 from Pounds 75,000 to over Pounds 80,000, so at Linread's
Redditch plant, where team working is most developed in the group and output
per employee has risen from Pounds 30,500 in 1987 to Pounds 60,000.
Until demand recovers, such productivity gains are likely to be the main
source of increased profits. When Glynwed last week announced higher interim
profits it made the point that they came more from internal change than
external demand.
Equally, Linread is coping with sluggish demand on the aerospace side and
uncertain demand on the automotive side. But on both sides of the business
its selling prices are under pressure. Coping with its own costs is the only
immediate way to financial stability.
The problem is general. As the CBI-BSL regional trends survey said
yesterday, 'West Midlands manufacturers report falls in both unit costs and
selling prices.'

FT  12 AUG 93 / UK Company News: JFB still suffering from lack of orders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JOHNSON &amp; FIRTH Brown, the specialist engineering group, yesterday issued a
profits warning citing the absence of any recovery in its order books.
The announcement prompted a slide in the share price which finished 7 1/2 p
lower at 40 1/2 p, with almost 5.8m shares changing hands.
When the group announced its interim results in early June, Mr Martin
Llowarch, chairman, cautioned that a stronger order book, especially from
larger customers, had failed to materialise.
At that stage he said that a number of important potential orders in the
light engineering division had again been deferred.
Yesterday the group said that since then, despite earlier signs of a general
economic recovery and expectations that it would feed through to JFB by the
second half, 'the order book has not only failed to strengthen, but is
currently at lower levels across almost the whole of the group than a few
months ago.'
At the monthly board meeting yesterday it was noted that even if orders were
now to improve it would be too late to have much effect on this financial
year ending September 30.
'Consequently, although the group continues to trade profitably, the
directors now expect the results for the six months to end-September 1993 to
be below those in the first half of this financial year.'
In the first half JFB blamed continued price competition for a 38 per cent
fall in pre-tax profits to Pounds 2.07m (Pounds 3.32m) on increased sales of
Pounds 63.3m (Pounds 60.3m).
The interim dividend was maintained at 1p. The decision on the final would
be made in December, taking into account the view of the next financial year
at the time.
Sterling's devaluation had been expected to help the group combat some
fierce overseas price cutting, but German competitors had reacted by
reducing their prices by a further 15 per cent.

FT  12 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Fresh capital to ensure growth - Future tax
uncertainties prompt 'one-off' move
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMMERCIAL UNION is gearing up for further expansion after rapid growth in
the first six months.
Following its rights issue earlier this year, the company aims to earmark
some Pounds 100m cash it expects to raise from the enhanced scrip dividend,
announced yesterday, to support these efforts.
Premium income in the half year to June 30 grew by 28 per cent to Pounds
3.04bn. Much of the growth was concentrated in the UK where premiums from
general insurance rose by an underlying rate of 20 per cent to Pounds
895.9m.
Mr Peter Foster, general manager (finance), said the scrip dividend would
enable CU to 'retain additional capital, allowing growth of both life and
non-life business in the UK, and life business overseas.'
Fresh capital was particularly needed to support new overseas life insurance
ventures especially in southern Europe. These are capital intensive and
impose new business strain. CU is keen to increase its share of the life
market in order to balance its exposure to more volatile general lines.
Sales of new life annual premiums in the UK increased by 12 per cent,
reflecting increased sales of mortgage related and pensions busi- ness.
CU, however, is also confident about prospects for the general insurance
market, especially in the UK where the company is expecting a prolonged
period of profitabil- ity.
Mr John Carter, the general manager who takes over as chief executive next
year, said that scarcity of capital and falling returns from investment was
forcing companies to aim to achieve profits on their underwriting operations
and was leading to a general improvement in underwriting discipline.
We expect a 'better and longer peak to the underwriting cycle' and a period
of 'underwriting profits'.

FT  12 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Almost 100 show interest in Dunkeld
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Administrative receivers at Dunkeld Group, the manufacturer of Slix swimwear
and Pierre Balmain shirts which collapsed on Monday, have received
approaches from almost 100 interested parties, including management
appointed to the group less than three weeks ago.
A buy-out was launched yesterday by Mr Graham Hudson and Mr Bill Walker, who
joined Dunkeld at the end of last month to run the swimwear and shirt
divisions. They were meeting yesterday with receivers to negotiate a price.
Price Waterhouse, which is acting for management in the negotiations, said
yesterday it was too early to put a value on the company. The management
team had no facilities in place as yet, although it was 'in the process of
selecting investors'.
Mr Walker, formerly business development director for the VF Corporation
Europe, said he was confident that both the shirt and swimwear businesses,
along with the group's 500 employees, 'could have a successful and
profitable future'. Dunkeld claims the UK's number one position in ladies
swimwear, with 18 per cent of the market. It is also one of the UK's four
largest shirt suppliers.
Dunkeld, which almost collapsed two years ago after a heady expansion phase
left it crippled with debt, bought the swimwear division and a shirt-making
business less than a year ago. The deals were accompanied by a placing to
raise Pounds 1.7m and a second financial restructuring in which bankers Hill
Samuel converted Pounds 5.9m of debt into equity.
However, the burden of debt built up in the 1980s proved too much for
Dunkeld.

<TEXT>
Armitage Brothers, the pet foods and products manufacturer, marginally
increased sales and profits in the year to May 30.
Profit before tax was Pounds 875,000 (Pounds 851,000), but a rise in the tax
charge reduced earnings per share to 14.6p (16.4p). The dividend is stepped
up to 6.2p (6p) with a final of 3.6p.
Turnover came to Pounds 21.9m (Pounds 21.8m) following an 11 per cent rise
in exports and similar growth in dried dog food. Gross margin deficit was
more than recovered by further reductions in overheads.
In the current year sales were showing a slight upturn and Christmas orders
were ahead. Margins were still under extreme pressure.

<TEXT>
Metal Bulletin, the international business publisher, raised pre-tax profits
by 22 per cent from Pounds 711,600 to Pounds 871,300 in the six months to
June 30 and, based on current activity levels, there was optimism that five
consecutive years of growth would be extended in 1993.
Mr Trevor Tarring, chairman, said the period had seen a continuation of the
growth pattern first experienced late in 1992 by the metals, futures and
options and managed funds divisions.
The minerals information side continued to be a solid contributor to
profits, while the textiles division - acquired at the end of 1992 - had
been successfully integrated and was exceeding its budget for turnover and
profit.
Group turnover expanded 19 per cent to Pounds 6.91m (Pounds 5.81m). Earnings
per 10p share rose from 5.1p to 6p and an increased interim dividend of 2.9p
(2.7p) is declared.

FT  12 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Ward back in black with Pounds 0.3m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IMPROVED income in housebuilding, rental income and property disposals,
enabled Ward Holdings to record a pre-tax profit of Pounds 347,000 for the
half year to April 30.
That compared with a loss of Pounds 1.8m in the corresponding period, which
increased to Pounds 5.29m by the end of that year.
Turnover in housebuilding came to Pounds 10.4m (Pounds 9.2m). Trading
conditions in the south-east of England continued to be depressed but the
company sold more houses than last time. Margins continued to be squeezed,
the market overhang of housing stock remained and problems created by
repossessions continued, said Mr Denis Ward, chairman.
Sales of industrial and commercial units were being achieved where lettings
had been secured. Contracts had also been exchanged for the sale of part of
the Lordswood Industrial Estate.
Gross rents and property disposals totalled Pounds 8.32m (Pounds 1.08m).
Earnings per share were 0.7p (2.3p losses).
Value of the land bank will be reviewed on October 31 so the directors were
unable to determine likely results for the year.

FT  12 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Enhanced scrip dividendat Commercial Union
 -Future tax uncertainties prompt 'one-off' move
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMMERCIAL UNION is offer-ing the lion's share of its annual dividend to
shareholders at halfway instead of the year end and offering to pay extra
dividends in shares out of concern that the Treasury may close a
tax-advantaged financing loophole in the November budget.
'It is the uncertainties about the future tax position which have prompted
this,' said Mr Peter Foster, general manager (finance).
Dividends paid in shares do not attract advance corporation tax, unlike
those paid in cash. Companies may offset ACT against UK taxes paid, but
those with high overseas earnings or those with low domestic tax bills
cannot recover their ACT.
Mr Foster said the exercise was 'a one-off' and would not be repeated.
Changes to the rules on ACT and the likelihood that CU's domestic tax charge
will rise as its UK operations return to profitability should make future
enhanced scrip dividends less attractive to the company.
The Treasury has given no public indication that it will close the loophole,
which has helped UK companies cut their tax bill by over Pounds 200m since
April. It has only said that it is 'watching' market developments and from
next year has offered to help cut the ACT charge for those with high
overseas earnings.
CU will pay shareholders who elect cash an interim dividend of 15.1p, equal
to the final declared at the end of 1992. It paid an interim dividend of
9.25p last year. 'We are effectively reversing the order of the final and
interim dividends,' Mr Foster said. However, the move does not signify that
the final dividend will be 9.25p.
Investors who accept the dividend in shares will gain an additional 50 per
cent, equivalent to a minimum of 22.65p. If all shareholders elect shares,
the offer will result in the issue of 16.5m new shares and save the company
Pounds 23.6m in ACT charges and Pounds 81.2m in cash which would have been
spent on dividends.
Assuming full take-up, the existing share capital will be diluted by 3.5 per
cent. Previous enhanced scrip dividends from other UK companies have had 90
per cent or more election of shares.
Mr Foster said that Pounds 100m which could be raised will be deployed in
CU's existing life and non-life insurance businesses.
In order to finance the new shares at the same rate as existing shares, CU
will need a return on capital of between 6 and 7 per cent. Currently, it is
earning return on capital of 8 per cent.

FT  12 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Holliday Chemical dips after Spanish
setback
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A DISAPPOINTING per-formance by a recent Spanish acquisition and the loss of
one big order was responsible for Holliday Chemical Holdings reporting a
small fall in pro forma pre-tax profits for the half year to end-June.
Profits slipped from Pounds 6.8m to Pounds 6.7m on sales ahead at Pounds
54.9m (Pounds 48.6m). The results were adjusted to reflect the April
flotation which raised net proceeds of Pounds 31m.
The chemicals business saw profits fall from Pounds 5.2m to Pounds 4.3m for
two main reasons; the recent acquisition of Barisyntex in Spain is taking
longer than envisaged to generate profits and the company lost a big order
for an ingredient for hair dye.
Mr Michael Peagram, founder and chairman, said: 'The loss of the order is
not a huge embarrassment; it has basically been deferred until next year.'
He remains confident that Barisyntex will be making profits by next year.
Despite what he described as the continuing difficult international economic
climate, Mr Peagram said he could see no reason why current trading
performance should not be sustained.
With net debt of Pounds 14m, representing gearing of 30 per cent, Mr Peagram
said the group was well positioned to make further acquisitions. 'We are
looking at two and hope to complete at least one by the year end'.
Capital expenditure was lower than expected at Pounds 2m. It is now unlikely
to run to more than Pounds 4m in the second half, although at the time of
the flotation the company said it expected to spend about Pounds 8m. 'We
took our eye off the ball during the flotation, which took up a lot of our
time,' Mr Peagram said.
Earnings per share were unchanged at 5.9p. The interim dividend is 1.6p.
COMMENT
It would be churlish to be too critical of Holliday just because of a 1.5
per cent fall in pro forma pre-tax profits. The company has an impressive
record of growth since its management buy-out in 1987. Earnings per share
growth has averaged 22 per cent over the last five years on a pro forma
basis and organic growth has been augmented by a string of acquisitions with
a proven record. Yet by its own standards a disappointing performance from a
Spanish acquisition and the loss of a big order causes some concern. It may
only prove to be temporary but the cut in capital expenditure could be
interpreted as a sign of the tough times. With forecast pre-tax profits of
Pounds 14m, the shares - up 3p to 214p - look fully valued on a prospective
multiple of 17.3.

FT  12 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Investigation clearance for Trafalgar House
accountants
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ACCOUNTANTS and auditors involved in the preparation of the
controversial 1991 accounts of Trafalgar House have been cleared of any
disciplinary action by their professional body.
The investigation committee of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in
England and Wales said yesterday that there were no grounds to act against
its members, who included four directors of the company, and Touche Ross,
the auditor.
It said the accounts were prepared after 'appropriate consideration' by the
directors, and that the controversy was a function of 'honest differences of
professional opinion'. The examination was triggered automatically by a
ruling from the Financial Reporting Review Panel, the UK accounts watchdog,
which forced the company to restate its 1991 figures in the 1992 accounts.
The company reversed its decision to charge a Pounds 102.7m deficit on
revaluation of properties directly to reserves rather than against profits,
and added back Pounds 20m in advance corporation tax to the original Pounds
40.4m charge.
The case was the nearest the review panel has so far come to using its legal
powers to take a company to court to force the directors to restate their
accounts. After initially refusing to co-operate in a battle with the panel
which is believed to have cost the company about Pounds 500,000, Trafalgar
House relented last October.
It had been heavily criticised by shareholders at its annual meeting, who
voted against the reappointment as auditors of Touche Ross, which had given
Trafalgar House an unqualified audit report.
The decision by the Institute not to take any disciplinary action raises the
question of how robust was the review panel's original verdict.
But it is believed that the Institute had no information which might have
swayed its views on the reasons behind the review panel's ruling beyond the
public statements made at the time.

FT  12 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Less fizz as Vimto declines to Pounds 3.4m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LIKE MANY British cultural icons, the herbal drink Vimto wins greater
recognition abroad than at home.
However, the effect of poor weather on sales in its home market overcame
sustained export demand for JN Nichols' 85-year-old flagship brand, in
particular the launch of the brew on the Russian market and its continued
popularity in the Middle East.
Pre-tax profits declined from Pounds 3.53m to Pounds 3.4m, on turnover of
Pounds 24.1m (Pounds 23.6m).
Vimto sells in more than 25 countries and has roughly 2 per cent of the UK
market. The brand was first concocted in 1908 by John Noel Nichols, a former
stockbrokers' clerk.
He moved the soft drinks maker from beginnings in Salford, which its
advertising describes as 'humble', to the implicitly more glamorous setting
of 'an old Manchester laundry' and it has stayed in that city ever since.
The company blamed the downturn on the combination of sterling's exit from
the ERM, which raised raw material prices, and inclement weather in the UK
in May and June which together put pressure on margins.
Nevertheless, the interim dividend goes up to 5.4p (5.1p), payable from
earnings per share down at 14.4p compared with 14.8p.
Mr John Nichols, grandson of the founder and managing director, said: 'There
are many factors that will influence the final outcome for the year but the
board feels sufficiently confident to raise the interim dividend.'
As well as its soft drinks activity, Nichols has canning operations and a
vending machine ingredients business.
It is in the middle of a Pounds 4m capital spending programme.

FT  12 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Making a whole of the parts - Why a
restructuring plan is in progress at APV
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
APV, the UK group which is one of the world's largest manufacturers of food
processing equipment, is still feeling the effects of an acquisitive binge
in the 1980s.
After escaping a hostile bid from Siebe in 1986, the group doubled its
turnover in three years through a series of purchases, but did little to
integrate the various businesses.
APV's profit margins melted away as recession struck its main markets. Last
year's pre-tax profits of Pounds 21.1m, on sales of Pounds 947.5m, were just
over a third of those achieved in its peak year in 1989.
Mr Clive Strowger, appointed chief executive in June last year, has launched
an extensive restructuring programme to focus the group, which has once
again become the subject of takeover speculation.
However, he is doing so against a background of depressed order books and
fierce pressure from competitors on margins.
Mr Strowger moved quickly to strengthen the balance sheet last year by
selling Vent-Axia, a fan and hand drier business, to Smiths Industries for
Pounds 56m and in the same week closed a lossmaking beer-kegging equipment
site in Kent.
Despite reducing its workforce from 14,000 to 11,600 over the past two
years, APV still has more than 100 operating units, spread across 10
countries. Mr Strowger says: 'Complexity is both our problem and our
opportunity.'
Under a business plan agreed in the autumn, the group has identified
companies that have a global responsibility for market segments such as
dairy, ice cream, beverages, dry foods, processed foods, fruit juices, and
industrial sectors such as pharmaceuticals. Other companies have global
product responsibilities, while area companies have responsibility for
improved market penetration in their territories.
A principal aim of this approach is to prevent different parts of APV
competing against each other. The group has a strong position in fruit juice
extraction equipment and on occasion as many as three APV companies have bid
for the same contract.
UBS, the stockbroker, says: 'While this may well have been a joyous, if
slightly confusing, experience for the customer, such internal competition
does, we believe, go a considerable way to explaining APV's low margins.'
Putting together the first unified bid team from APV subsidiaries also
helped the group to win a Pounds 16m contract for a Korean brewery, for
which it will provide project management, engineering and installation
services, plus the beer processing equipment. Mr Strowger says he intends to
build on this multi-disciplinary approach to win more turnkey contracts.
The chief executive says that underlying all these changes is a desire to
get closer to the group's customers. He describes this as a key accounts
strategy, in which APV aims to have preferred relationship with its
customers.
The group is anxious to move away from low-margin manufacturing and
contracting work, and focus more on developing specific products and
processes for customers, on which both sides can make good returns.
Mr Strowger says: 'Engineering and products are all being standardised.
Make/buy decisions are being made all the time - we are now doing minimum
amount of manufacturing.'
APV does have some very strong products, and extensive experience of
developing processes in collaboration with the main food and drinks groups.
It claims a two-year lead in applying microwave technology to commercial
baking ovens, and has invested heavily in ohmic heating systems, which
produce food capable being stored for long periods without refrigeration.
Unfortunately, the group is having to implement this strategy against flat
or falling markets - particularly in continental Europe, which accounts for
40 per cent of sales.
APV hopes some purchases are merely being deferred, but analysts believe
spending was due to decline in real terms after the heavy levels of
investment by the food and drinks industry in the late 1980s. Whatever the
group's hopes, its business plan assumes no underlying market growth in the
next three years.
The UK group is also facing ferocious competition on prices - not least from
its two main rivals, Tetra Laval, the Swedish food packaging and equipment
group, and GEA, the German company, which are both more concentrated on the
liquid foods sector.
APV believes there is considerable consolidation going on and that all the
main groups are suffering from high fixed costs. Mr Strowger says: 'Our
erosion of margins is being felt by everyone else. The risk is that smaller
companies will be driven into the arms of some of our larger rivals.'
The UK group does not rule out strategic alliances in particular countries
or product areas, but is more likely to start making infill acquisitions. Mr
Strowger says: 'We have gaps in our range in a number of sectors, if we can
find suitable partners.'
APV has been the target of recurring bid speculation and this was
strengthened last year when it emerged that GEA had quietly built up a 2.8
per cent stake in the group.
Mr Strowger is fatalistic about the prospect of facing a hostile bid: 'I'm
not sure that a predator could do anything very different to what we've done
for the business. If it happens, it happens. But if someone came out of the
woodwork, they would have to pay a substantial premium for the organic value
of the business.'
UBS says: 'If the new management fails in its task to improve the
performance of the group the fact that APV is a market leader in an
international business will not see it remain independent for long.'
APV says European orders are down by only 10 per cent, so the extent of the
current downturn can be exaggerated. The group, which has 80 per cent of its
turnover outside the UK, will also benefit from the devaluation of sterling
and sees opportunities in the Pacific Rim.
Mr Strowger remains optimistic: 'Having compiled the business plan, the
opportunities for us are much greater than hitherto thought.'

FT  12 AUG 93 / CU pleases with payout
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMMERCIAL Union yesterday followed General Accident in announcing a
turnround in first-half performance.
CU, the strongest of the five composite insurers, announced pre-tax profits
of Pounds 65.5m, compared with a pre-tax loss of Pounds 18.1m.
It said it was proposing an enhanced scrip dividend alternative to the
interim dividend of 15.10p. This compared with last year's interim payout of
8.95p and a final of 15.10p - it was effectively reversing their order. CU
added that the enhanced scrip dividend was worth 22.2p. Investors welcomed
both the profits, which were slightly ahead of expectations, and the
dividend announcement, marking the shares up 12p to 661p.
Earnings per share amounted to 25.7p, compared with 34.9p. Both figures
include realised investment gains.
Like General Accident, which reported its turnround on Tuesday, CU's profit
improvement was based on a revival in the UK market, where underwriting
losses fell to Pounds 56.6m from Pounds 95.9m in the first half of 1992.
In home and motor insurance - where rates have been increased sharply in the
past two years - CU posted underwriting profits of Pounds 13.8m, compared
with a deficit of Pounds 17.4m.
Losses of Pounds 25m from the Bishopsgate bomb in April offset improvement
on commercial lines. CU was hit by underwriting losses of Pounds 45.9m on
its London market - marine and other specialised commercial - business,
worsening from Pounds 37.5m. CU is the biggest insurance company in the
marine business in London and, like Lloyd's, accounts for results in this
sector three years in arrears. Overall underwriting losses fell to Pounds
165.4, compared with Pounds 202.2m in the first half of last year.
Investment income net of loan interest amounted to Pounds 168.9m, against
Pounds 129.4m.
Earnings from associated undertakings fell to Pounds 4.4m (Pounds 7m). Life
profits amounted to Pounds 57.6m (Pounds 50.7m). After taxation and
minorities of Pounds 18m (Pounds 5.6m) and realised investment gains of
Pounds 92.8m (Pounds 182.4m), profits attributable to shareholders fell to
Pounds 140.3m (Pounds 158.7m).
Shareholders' funds at June 30 amounted to Pounds 1.98bn, up from Pounds
1.5bn at the end of December, with the increase reflecting rights issue
proceeds of Pounds 428m. A rise of Pounds 113m in investment values, after
taxation, was partly offset by the adverse effect of exchange rate movements
amounting to Pounds 31m.

FT  12 AUG 93 / Westinghouse starts asset sales with Dollars 1.1bn division
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WESTINGHOUSE Electric, the troubled US conglomerate, is set to sell its
electrical distribution and control equipment business to Eaton Corporation,
the engineering group, for Dollars 1.1bn (Pounds 745m).
Cleveland-based Eaton is also assuming certain liabilities.
The sale is conditional on government approvals and the waiver by Germany's
Siemens of a 'right of first refusal'. Siemens, which was granted the right
in 1988, said it was 'looking to see how things develop'.
Westinghouse added it had been in close contact with the German company,
which should be in a position to make a 'prompt' decision. If the Siemens'
waiver is not received within 30 days, Eaton can terminate the deal. If the
sale goes through, it will be the first element in an asset-sale package
announced last November by Pittsburgh-based Westinghouse, which has been
dogged by bad property loans.
As well as quitting financial services, it revealed plans to sell four
non-strategic operations: the distribution and control business;
Westinghouse Electric Supply; the Knoll International office furniture unit;
and the Westinghouse Communities property development subsidiary. It pledged
to cut debt by more than Dollars 5bn in two years.
Mr Michael Jordan, who took over the chair in July, said the proceeds would
help pay down debt resulting from the financial services unit's losses.
The distribution and control business makes low-voltage circuit protection
equipment and employs about 12,500 people at 36 plants, mainly in North
America, South America and the UK.
Eaton said the Westinghouse operations would be combined with its industrial
control and power distribution business to create a division with sales of
about Dollars 1.6bn. Group sales should increase by about 25 per cent.
Last year, the company - best-known for the manufacture of truck
transmissions and axles, engines components and electrical equipment and
controls - had turnover of Dollars 3.87bn.
Eaton plans to fund the purchase initially via bank borrowings. However, it
added that it was also planning an equity issue.
Westinghouse shares closed down Dollars  1/8 at Dollars 15 3/4 , while Eaton
ended the day up Dollars  3/4 at Dollars 45 3/4 .

FT  12 AUG 93 / Ferruzzi tells creditors of lower debt: Industrial group may
extend legal action against former bosses as mood of suspicion hangs over
most companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FERRUZZI Finanziaria (Ferfin), the troubled Italian industrial group,
reduced total borrowings to L28,838bn (Pounds 12bn) at the end of May from
L31,073bn last December, according to new figures prepared for bankers
yesterday.
The new data, presented to Ferfin's foreign bank creditors, came hours after
the board of Montedison, Ferfin's main industrial subsidiary, called a
shareholders' meeting to consider extending legal action against the
previous bosses.
A Milan court is due to rule on Monday on the temporary order granted to
sequester L500bn in assets from former Montedison executives and the heirs
of Mr Raul Gardini, who shot himself last month. Montedison and Ferruzzi are
now run by new managers imposed by Ferfin's main bank creditors.
Montedison said the previous management had included in last year's accounts
L243bn in royalties expected from the Erbamont pharmaceuticals subsidiary,
sold to Sweden's Procordia in March. These royalties should only have been
recognised when they were paid. The previous management had been trying to
reduce 1992 losses of L1,679bn.
Montedison's 1993 accounts will now only show a capital gain of about L98bn
from the Erbamont sale, rather than L341bn.
At the bankers' presentation, to be repeated to Italian creditors today, it
was emphasised that Ferfin was functioning normally at the operating level.
First-half sales had risen 19 per cent to L11,489bn, while gross operating
profits jumped 33 per cent to L1,391bn. Adjusted for the lira's devaluation,
sales rose 3 per cent and gross operating profits 18 per cent. Most
operations had improved their performance, notably the Edison energy
subsidiary. Chemicals had been mixed, while Calcestruzzi (cement and
building materials) had suffered a 10 per cent fall in sales, to L782bn.
Fondiaria, the insurance company controlled by Ferfin, recovered to a net
operating profit of L12bn from a L104bn loss. Premium income rose 13.4 per
cent to L2,439bn.
Trading in Ferfin and Montedison shares, suspended on Tuesday, resumes
today.

FT  12 AUG 93 / Corporate Italy flounders in the mess left by scandal
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It is open season on business news in Italy. So deep has the 18-month
political corruption scandal run that it is possible to write virtually
anything about any company - without the hint of a libel action.
Even the most punctilious press officers, once swift to denounce an
unflattering headline, are silent. If their companies have not already been
implicated, the risk of nasty surprises around the corner is enough to deter
any aggression towards the media.
In recent months, the scandal has widened to include many of Italy's most
famous companies. Fiat has admitted to paying kickbacks at its bus, railway
equipment, gas turbine and construction subsidiaries.
Mr Carlo De Benedetti, chairman of Olivetti, has seen his prestige dive.
Only days after declaring that the computers group had never paid bribes, he
admitted to Milan magistrates that kickbacks had been paid.
Most recently, attention has switched to Ferruzzi, Italy's second biggest
private company, where political corruption and financial mismanagement
appear to have gone hand in hand.
Leaked testimony by senior Ferruzzi managers and family members suggests the
group, then run by Mr Raul Gardini, who shot himself last month, paid about
L135bn (Pounds 56m) to politicians in connection with the Enimont chemicals
joint venture.
The testimony also suggests Ferruzzi operated what amounted to a parallel
set of books to cover vast commodity trading losses, deal with takeover
finance and even to subsidise the controlling family's lavish lifestyle.
The corruption scandal has focused on contracts with the state. The practice
of giving bribes was particularly acute in construction and pharmaceuticals,
where the companies involved depended on public sector contracts. However,
service industries, such as public relations and advertising, which also won
substantial state business, have also been implicated.
Earnings at big building groups, including Fiat's Cogefar Impresit
subsidiary and Grassetto, controlled by Premafin, have plunged because of
the virtual collapse of new orders.
The scandals have also affected thousands of smaller companies, often
dependent on larger counterparts embroiled in the affair. Many small
builders, which would normally act as sub-contractors to the big groups
accused of paying kickbacks, are now facing bankruptcy.
The pharmaceuticals industry is also in a mess following allegations of
bribes to a central committee of academics and civil servants. This body
recommended prices and suggested which products should go on the
government's list of free medicines.
Corruption has tarnished the image of many of Italy's most famous concerns
and affected decision-making at a crucial time of domestic recession and
depressed export markets. Fiat, struggling with a collapsing domestic car
market, floundered earlier this year while some of its senior executives
languished in jail and others extended their foreign 'business trips' to
avoid interrogation.
Morale has been hit. Fiat was forced to overturn its policy of not
co-operating with the magistrates investigating political corruption. Having
presented itself as 'above' the seedier side of Italian politics, it has
been revealed to have played along with the politicians. Its image has also
been tainted because its size and prestige should have enabled it to resist
the entreaties of rapacious politicians.
Meanwhile, the magistrates' strategy of distinguishing between co-operative
company executives and those less willing to spill the beans has contributed
to a mood of suspicion and intrigue. Some executives have languished in
Milan's decrepit San Vittore jail while under interrogation, others have
been kept in more salubrious surroundings.
That differentiation has occasionally led to a rush to testify when
magistrates have discovered a new line of inquiry, as in the recent
pharmaceuticals revelations. The fear that a competitor might be more
willing to co-operate has induced many executives, who remained silent about
kickbacks for years, to tell their stories.
The magistrates' psychological tactics have sometimes contributed to an ugly
atmosphere within companies. At Ferruzzi, clear signs of internal conflict
have emerged in apparent attempts to shift 'responsibility' for the alleged
misdeeds from one branch of the controlling family to another.
Most surprising, however, is the fact that the scandals have not had much of
an impact on the stock market, which has risen almost 30 per cent this year.
The bourse's obliviousness is even more striking in view of the arrest this
month of Mr Bruno Pazzi, a retired chairman of Italy's Consob stock market
watchdog. It is alleged that Mr Pazzi accepted kickbacks and was secretly on
the payroll of Ferruzzi's Montedison subsidiary.
Investors have attached more weight to the prospect of export-led recovery
helped by the cheaper lira, interest rate cuts and potential privatisations.
If bourse indices tracked companies' present standing, rather than
investors' expectations, they might well paint a different picture.

FT  12 AUG 93 / Bank eases grip on settlement of gilts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BANK of England, in a move to widen the appeal of UK government bonds to
overseas buyers, will allow investors to hold and settle gilts using the two
international clearing systems, Cedel and Euroclear.
At present, investors have to settle gilts through the Bank of England's
Central Gilts Office (CGO).
However, discussions are taking place between the Bank, Cedel and Euroclear
to establish a link with the CGO, allowing investors to hold and settle
gilts through Cedel and Euroclear.
For international investors with a range of European government bonds and
eurobonds in their fixed income portfolios, it may be more convenient to
keep all their holdings under one roof and settle in one currency.
The CGO provides an efficient electronic system for investors to hold stock,
and allows institutional investors or gilt-edged marketmakers who have
accounts there to transfer UK government stock easily. The CGO was set up by
the Bank in 1986, the year of Big Bang, to provide investors with a speedy
settlement system.
However, investors argue that if they want, for example, to move out of UK
gilts and switch the proceeds into French or German government bonds, it is
more convenient to do so using one system - whether that be Cedel or
Euroclear.
'Settlement at the CGO is extremely efficient, but some investors prefer to
use an international settlements system,' said Mr John Kendall, economist at
Baring Sterling Bonds.
Overseas investors have been keen buyers of gilts in recent months. Many
were attracted by sterling's weakness against the D-Mark earlier this year,
and were looking for a sterling appreciation of their assets and a further
rally in the gilt market.

FT  12 AUG 93 / Hospital audits to go to tender: Accountancy firms welcome
pilot scheme in market testing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS and ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AUDIT SERVICES for hospital trusts and local authorities are to be opened to
competition next year in a market testing exercise by the Audit Commission.
The move was immediately welcomed by large accountancy firms, many of which
are anxious for new sources of business.
Sir David Cooksey, chairman of the commission, which this year received
gross fee income of Pounds 76.6m for auditing public bodies with a total
turnover of about Pounds 85bn, announced today that the commission's
district audit service is to be made administratively separate.
The commission will then work as a purchaser of services provided by the
district audit service or outside accounting firms.
About 30 per cent of the commission's work is already shared between eight
firms of private auditors, and the district audit service itself contracts
out 15.3 per cent of its workload. However, rival bids are assessed only on
quality, and all firms are paid a uniform audit fee, making it 'very
difficult to pass on the benefits of competitive tendering', according to
Sir David.
Under a pilot scheme due to start in April next year, 2 per cent of the
commission's audit work will be awarded on the basis of price competition.
Most contracts will involve new National Health Service trusts, but some
local authority contracts will be included. The scheme will then be
monitored for at least a year before deciding whether to extend the
programme. Sir David said: 'We are able to do this because with the next
wave of trusts coming through in April next year there is an increase in
workload.'
He said the scheme remained on a limited scale because the review of local
government structure in England by Sir John Banham, former director-general
of the Confederation of British Industry, is still in progress.
'Once the outcome of the local government review is fully understood, a much
larger tranche will be put up for tender,' Sir David said.
Price Waterhouse was one of several large accountancy firms which expressed
interest in bidding for the new contracts.
Mr Gordon Cartmell of Touche Ross said: 'It is very early days but we are
interested in pursuing these contracts.' He said the firm would make a
judgment on each potential tender, based on what services it might be
excluded from by taking on the audits.
Auditors might, for example, be barred from offering computer consultancy,
tax advice or general management consultancy. The commission has promised
'full discussion' with interested parties before the first pilot.

FT  12 AUG 93 / Clydesdale Bank to shed 800 jobs: Reorganisation designed to
cut costs and boost services
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON and JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CLYDESDALE BANK, the Scottish subsidiary of National Australia Bank,
disclosed yesterday that it intends to cut 800 jobs by 1995.
It will remove most processing work from its 350 branches, becoming the
latest retail bank to announce large job cuts.
The transfer of cheque processing and telephone inquiries to three
processing centres will eliminate 1,400 jobs, mainly from branches.
It will create 600 new posts at the centres. The bank employs about 7,500
people.
The announcement follows a series of restructuring efforts by UK banks to
cut staff while delivering services through new forms of technology.
Barclays intends to cut 9,000 jobs by 1995, while Royal Bank of Scotland is
cutting 3,500.
Mr Charles Love, chief executive, said the move was aimed at reducing costs
and improving services. It would enable the bank to go on serving customers
in some rural areas which might otherwise have lost their branches.
Mr Love said the bank would try to maximise the number of jobs lost through
natural wastage, and avoid compulsory redundancy.
However, the Banking, Insurance and Finance Union said it would seek a
guarantee of voluntary redundancy.
Clydesdale wants to cut its relatively high ratio of costs to income from
the last financial year's 66 per cent - the highest among Scottish banks -
by 3 to 4 per cent a year over the next two years. Its target is a ratio of
50 per cent.
It is setting up two paper processing centres employing over 500 staff, one
in Glasgow and another possibly in Aberdeen.
A third centre for handling telephone inquiries will be set up in Glasgow,
and will employ 70 staff. Mr Sandy Boyle, Bifu's deputy general secretary,
said the union was 'shocked' at the number of job losses because the bank
had already cut 600 head office staff. But he welcomed the bank's
willingness to negotiate.
The bank said it did not intend to close any branches, but Mr Boyle said the
union was sceptical that it could cut the number of jobs it wanted within
two years without closures or damaging service in other ways.
The restructuring matches moves by other banks and building societies to
centralise back office operations. Mr Love said it was based on experience
gained at National Australia Bank.
Clydesdale's main strengths are in the west of Scotland and north-east
Scotland, based on Aberdeen.

FT  12 AUG 93 / Japan trade surplus up 28% as weak demand damps imports
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S trade surplus in July was Dollars 11.82bn (Pounds 8bn), 28 per cent
higher than in the same month of 1992, reflecting the weak demand for
imports from a still ailing domestic economy.
The surplus has risen year-on-year for 31 consecutive months. However, the
yen's strength is slowing export volume, which is up only 2.1 per cent.
The surplus also appears to be near its peak, which would be welcomed by
Japan's new coalition government.
Japanese industry leaders expressed regret at the sharp appreciation
yesterday of the yen, which closed in Tokyo at a record of Y103.77 to the
dollar, compared with Y104.47 on Tuesday, and said the figure did not
reflect the real health of the economy.
Mr Gaishi Hiraiwa, chairman of the Keidanren, the federation of economic
organisations, said the yen had 'deviated from reality' and that the
continuing appreciation had put great pressure on Japanese companies, which
already face a fourth year of falling profits.
Exports during July rose 9 per cent to Dollars 32.18bn, while imports grew
by a slim 0.4 per cent to Dollars 20.37bn, although both figures reflected
exchange rate movements.
The finance ministry said the average yen value for exports in July was
Y108.21 to the dollar, compared with Y125.57 a year earlier.
The surplus with the US rose 22.7 per cent to Dollars 4.68bn, the 16th
consecutive month of expansion, but Japan's surplus with the European
Community fell 19.5 per cent to Dollars 2.01bn. Seasonally adjusted, the
surplus rose from Dollars 8.64bn in June to Dollars 11.17bn last month.
Trade with China continues to expand at a remarkable rate and after almost
five years of deficit Japan now has a bilateral surplus.
Exports to China rose 68.7 per cent to Dollars 1.77bn, while imports were
17.1 per cent higher at Dollars 1.6bn. Last September, Japan had a deficit
for the month of Dollars 634m.
Indicating the demand from an overheated Chinese economy, car exports rose
five times, steel exports 167 per cent, and electric machinery 62 per cent.
However, the figures hardly reflect the true growth of Japanese exports
because they do not include goods shipped through Hong Kong.

US trade negotiators will hardly like Japan's latest trade surplus. True,
when expressed in yen the surplus is not rising. But neither has the yen's
appreciation this year significantly dented export performance. On
purchasing power measures the yen is very uncompetitive. But political
pressure and the failure of Japanese companies or banks to recycle the
current account surplus into overseas investment will continue to force the
yen higher. Those funds parked in Japan are now flowing into equities at a
time when manufacturers are being hurt by recession at home and squeezed
margins overseas. The stage is being set for another overvaluation of the
Japanese equity market.

The second exploratory easing in French overnight lending rates this week
highlights how keen the government is to lower the cost of borrowing without
jeopardising the remnants of its franc fort policy. So far, it has succeeded
in steering rates down without undue damage to the franc, helping it recoup
foreign currency reserves. However, if the government delays too long in
cutting other important rates, such as the intervention rate, it risks
losing the initiative. With investors relying on lower rates to underpin
surging equity and bond prices, the testy foreign exchange market may again
push the franc lower try to to force the government's hand.

<TEXT>
The shares of the world's biggest ball bearings manufacturer are on a roll.
Despite a steepening of first half losses to SKr469m, SKF's shares rose a
further 3 per cent yesterday as the Swedish stock market warmed to the
cyclical recovery story. As a supplier to Europe's engineering and
automotive sectors, SKF should be among the first to benefit from any upturn
in industrial demand. Moreover, the company will reap further competitive
gains from the krona's depreciation against the D-Mark.
There is no doubt, though, that SKF's markets remain severely depressed. The
company incurred first half losses of SKr440m from its operations in France
and Germany and is tentative about the prospects for improvement. A patchy
upturn in the US provides only limited comfort. The worry is that even when
demand recovers the easing of competitive pressures will be small. With the
likes of Mr Lopez on the prowl at Volkswagen, pricing demands on suppliers
are likely to remain intense.
Still, SKF is capable of achieving a large measure of its own financial
salvation. Although it may be late in the day in comparison with other
Swedish firms such as Atlas Copco, SKF is pushing through a drastic
rationalisation programme which will shrink its cost base. The market may be
right to believe that the company has turned the corner. But it has to look
a long way ahead for those heady expectations to be fulfilled.

FT  12 AUG 93 / The Lex Column: Commercial Union
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Commercial Union has a seemingly insatiable appetite for equity. Yesterday's
enhanced scrip dividend, which will add 3.5 per cent to shareholders' funds,
comes hard on the heels of February's rights call and two preference share
issues last year. The saving on advance corporation tax arising from the
scrip - and the improving profits trend - will doubtless overcome
shareholders' reservations about being asked to supply additional funds so
soon. The broader question is whether CU can spend the money wisely.
The rights and preference share issues are already contributing to profits
growth. Investment income from the proceeds, together with favourable
exchange rates, accounted for half of yesterday's Pounds 80m improvement in
interim operating profits. That is not to deny the strength of underwriting
recovery in the UK, which made up the remainder of the profits increase.
Like General Accident, CU has now nosed into underwriting profit on most of
its UK personal lines. But CU's premium growth has already slowed from the
heady rate set last year, underlining that rights issue provided
retrospective backing for business already written.
The slow-down in its drive for market share offers comfort that CU will not
plough headlong into the next UK underwriting downturn. With a solvency
ratio of around 50 per cent it is hardly awash with capital even after the
rights issue. Growth is more likely to come from overseas markets and life
assurance. With almost one-third of group premiums already coming from life
business, CU already looks more of a hybrid insurer than others in the
sector.

FT  12 AUG 93 / The Lex Column: Stretching the gap
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The contrast between yesterday's exuberance in the equity market and the
caution of industrialists is startling. Perhaps it is because CBI members do
not spend enough time looking at the plummeting gilt yield curve. Doubters
may question how rapidly a rising gilt market will aid recovery, but it is
certainly having a powerful impact on investment flows. Low returns on cash
and falling gilt yields are pushing both private and professional investors
towards shares. Indeed, it seems that domestic fund managers have not been
in the van of the recent charge. Private investors, overseas funds and bank
buying in the gilts market have swelled the cash flow through the London
markets. Those UK fund managers and market makers who were left behind have
doubtless contributed to the snap move of the FT-SE 100 index above 3,000.
Still, while some investment criteria suggest that the rally can go further,
there are disturbing signs that valuations are stretched. Share ratings have
reached levels which are not justified by even the medium-term earnings
outlook. Those companies which have already released figures for the first
half of the year consistently report sluggish underlying business
conditions. Current valuations do not look supportable without 15 per cent
compound earnings growth until at least 1995. Granted, the economy got low
interest rates without the threat of inflation after last year's
devaluation. That may not be enough once market participants lower their
eyes from the blue skies of economic statistics and start to pick through
the nitty gritty of company results.

FT  12 AUG 93 / Leading Article: Hard questions for Germany
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE INSISTENCE of the Bundesbank on acknowledging responsibility only for
price stability in Germany, to the exclusion of wider European
considerations, has led some commentators to ask whether Germany has now
broken free of the double inhibition imposed on it as a nation-state by the
second world war and the cold war, and must from now on be expected to
prefer its national interests to those of Europe.
The facts do not justify such an alarmist question. In matters monetary the
Germans, and more especially the Bundesbank, have never been inhibited about
putting national interests first. Their defence is that by weakening the
D-Mark they would do no service to Europe. Better suspend or relax the ERM
for a time than allow the European ship to drag its German anchor.
As for the broader issues, Chancellor Helmut Kohl and his government are
clearly sincere in believing that the upset is only temporary, that Phase
Two of monetary union can and must still start on January 1 next year with
the creation of the European Monetary Institute, and that Phase Three, the
single currency, can still happen in 1999, even if 1997 is now less likely.
They remain adamant that the EMI must be located in Frankfurt, and that the
single currency can be joined only by countries that meet the full
Maastricht criteria. But there is nothing new about either of those demands.
On the second there has even been a hint of greater flexibility from the
Bundesbank president himself, who has remarked publicly that the figure of
60 per cent of GDP for government debt - which Belgium, in particular, would
have great difficulty in meeting - is an arbitrary one. This suggests a
genuine German desire that the Emu timetable remain feasible for at least a
hard core of countries.
Present discontents
All such reasoning presupposes that the present discontents are essentially
temporary, and that 'normality', in the sense of a fiscally responsible
Germany whose central bank does not need to throttle back inflation with
high interest rates, will soon be restored. The cuts in unemployment and
social benefits on which the government agreed yesterday go some way to
support that hypothesis. But they are not enough in themselves to answer the
question. Is the ballooning of public expenditure caused by unification an
aberration, or will it rather be the previous 30 years that come to be seen
as historically exceptional: a period when the ambitions of the German state
were contained by abnormal circumstances, and German strength could express
itself only in the form of a large trade surplus and a strong currency?
Responsibilities
Quite apart from uncertainty about the time it will take to turn the east
German economy round, Germany also faces expectations and responsibilities
in central and eastern Europe which its elite will not wish to evade, but
which its electorate will not wish to finance by any permanent lowering of
their own material expectations. At the same time, Germany's ability to
maintain its position as a leading world industrial power is by no means
assured. The German ambassador in Italy and former head of the foreign
ministry planning staff, Mr Konrad Seitz, has recently drawn attention to
his country's backwardness, in comparison to the US and Japan, in developing
the new industries born of the revolutions in information and genetic
technology. (The point is valid, alas, not only for Germany but for Europe
as a whole.)
It is thus quite imaginable that Germany will not rapidly recover its fiscal
balance, but will find itself saddled with a structural budget deficit for
reasons similar, if on a smaller scale, to those that have afflicted the US.
If that happens, either the Bundesbank will continue to maintain interest
rates at a level which makes Phase Two of Maastricht unsustainable for other
European economies with less inflationary pressure, or its hold on monetary
policy will be broken by a revision of priorities in German society at
large. Either way the Maastricht route to Emu, which in essence is a gradual
agglutination of other currencies to a rock-solid D-Mark, would become
untenable. A great deal hangs on the nature, as well as the timing, of the
German recovery.

FT  12 AUG 93 / Leading Article: An entente that remains elusive
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ANGLO-FRENCH relations have never been characterised by undiluted sweetness
and light. Yet even by historic standards the degree of mutual
incomprehension after the upheaval in the European exchange rate mechanism
(ERM) ranks uncommonly high on the Richter scale. A glance at the recent
outpourings of the Fourth Estate in the respective countries  - and indeed
of the press in the rest of the Community - suggests a cultural divide that
will not be easily bridged as Europe takes stock after the debacle.
It will not help overmuch to seek explanations in old caricatures: the
Anglo-Saxon pro-market, pro-financial culture versus a French dirigiste
tendency that goes back to Colbert. To the extent that they have any
validity, these cultural stereotypes are anyway no longer the exclusive
property of the countries concerned.
Even under the socialists, France adopted an increasingly pro-business
culture in the 1980s. While this may have come more than two centuries after
Voltaire lauded Britain's libertarian brand of commercialism in his Lettres
Anglaises, there is no doubting the belated commitment. Both the socialists
and their right- of-centre successors have sought to turn Paris into a fit
competitor for the City of London by deregulating its markets. Influenced by
the Thatcher-Reagan model, other EC members succumbed to the liberalising
and privatising tendency.
Free-market British
For their part, the supposedly free-market British, with Mrs Thatcher
dissenting, went voluntarily into the rigid, post-1987 version of the ERM.
The move was widely regarded as helpful to industry, but scarcely accorded
with the view of a country that puts the interests of manufacturing second
to those of the City, which thrives on currency instability. How, then, do
we explain the wholly different responses of British and French politicians
to their mutually shared experience of destabilising speculation?
On the French side there is undoubtedly a historic preoccupation with
currency strength that goes back to France's central role in the 19th
century Latin Monetary Union and beyond. The measure of that commitment was
seen in the 1930s when French national income declined by a third in money
terms between 1930 and 1935, while the country stuck doggedly to the Gold
Bloc - this, despite the apparent benefits to the economy of the earlier
franc devaluation of the mid-1920s and the example of high growth in Britain
after sterling parted company with gold in 1931.
Economic costs
Equally striking is the French readiness to incur large economic costs in
pursuit of foreign policy goals, as in the ERM. The British antipathy for
such an approach is partly explained by the historically larger role of
trade in relation to GNP. But nor is the German appetite for economic and
political linkage on a par with the French: it was, after all, the
reluctance of the Bundesbank to jeopardise its own monetary policy by
supporting an ailing franc that disabled the ERM. That reluctance enjoys
ample support from German public opinion.
Yet the most striking area in which the French and other continental
Europeans differ from the Anglo-Saxons concerns speculation. To many
Britons, with a very open economy and the highest portfolio percentage of
overseas investment in the developed world, so-called speculation appears to
be a legitimate means of protecting the interests of pensioners and
policyholders; and of protecting the finances of employers in the tradeable
goods sector.
In contrast, much comment in France treats speculation as immoral; and such
is the respect for the state that the idea that the French may have been
saved by the markets from an appallingly deflationary policy blunder is
wholly alien. Nor is it a coincidence that 'new right' critiques of
majoritarian democracy have been slower to take root in France than in the
US and the UK. The notion that government needs to be fettered by more
constitutional constraints and market freedoms is simply incompatible with
the elitism that has accompanied France's recent economic success. Such
cultural differences do not preclude forward movement in the Community. But
they need to be explored and understood.

FT  12 AUG 93 / Muddle around the melting pot: David Dodwell examines
negotiations surrounding the troubled passage of Nafta as domestic politics
intrude
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A weary US trade negotiator emerged this week from five hours of
inconclusive talks on the North American Free Trade Agreement. He turned to
waiting reporters and said: 'I have a quote for you: Canada stinks. Mexico
stinks. Nafta stinks. I've cancelled my vacation three times because of
these talks, and now, I'm out of here.'
As talks in Washington have broken up for negotiators to snatch delayed
summer holidays, the outburst says much about the frustration that has built
up over months of glacial progress.
Three deadlines for completion of negotiations on side agreements to the
main treaty, covering minimum labour and environmental standards, have come
and gone in the past month. Trade lobbyists in Washington find it hard to
assesses whether the talks are close to completion, or close to collapse.
One spoke yesterday of 'wildly fluctuating assessments' circulating around
Capitol Hill.
But as negotiators have whittled away at the handful of outstanding labour
and environmental issues separating the US, Mexico and Canada, it seems all
three countries have domestic political barriers which cast doubt on a
successful outcome.
In the US, President Clinton is paralysed by an issue that divides the
Democratic party down the middle. With a bruising battle over the budget
just behind him, he is bracing himself for the controversial passage of
healthcare reform. Many advisers are urging him not to waste political
capital on Nafta, which they see as less pivotal.
Those in the party with either labour or environmental interests see Nafta
as a threat to jobs or to efforts to enforce higher environmental standards.
Mr Clinton is under pressure to deliver a deal which 'has teeth', both in
reversing environmental degradation in the maquiladoras (free-trade zones)
along the US-Mexico border, and in preventing labour abuses in factories
being relocated to Mexico.
For Mexico, the Nafta deal was intended to provide President Carlos Salinas
with a springboard for a like-minded reformist president to win the election
due in September next year. But after the long delays, officials stress the
agreement is not indispensable to stability and growth.
Mrs Kim Campbell, Canada's new prime minister, faces federal elections
within three months. During the recession of the past four years, which has
deeply dented the government's popularity, the US-Canada free-trade
agreement agreed in 1989 has been blamed by Canadian voters for many ills.
They think Nafta will make matters worse as factories and jobs continue to
be lost across the border. Mrs Campbell is unlikely to approve any Nafta
deal which can be interpreted as 'caving in' to the US.
For all three leaders, political constraints are proving inimical to signing
a Nafta deal. It is ironic that the agreement, once trumpeted as a
'win-win-win' deal for all involved, should now be seen as a liability.
Part of the 'win-win-win' outcome was to derive from labour-intensive
industries migrating to Mexico, while highly skilled production would be
concentrated in the US and Canada. But the prospect of job losses triggered
a furore in low-technology US industries, among trade unions, and among
environmental lobbyists. It is what prompted Mr Ross Perot, the former
presidential candidate, to talk of 'the sucking sound of jobs heading
south'. Environmentalists are convinced that it will be 'dirty industry'
that migrates in search of a less rigorous legislative environment in
Mexico.
Mr Ralph Nader, long-time US consumer rights campaigner and head of the
Sierra Club environmental group, criticises Mexico's cheap labour. He says
its 'comparative advantage' stems from its failure to enforce its child
labour law, and he insists that no trade agreement will compel Mexican
companies to enforce their worker, health or safety laws.
In contrast, many economists forecast net job gains accruing from Nafta in
both Mexico and the US. They also challenge claims of dirty industry
migration.
Using US commerce department figures that each Dollars 1bn of US exports
generates 20,000 US jobs, they say the Mexican market has been responsible
for the creation of nearly 500,000 US jobs in the past few years. Exports to
Mexico rose last year to Dollars 44bn.
But statistics appear to count for little as the battle intensifies to win
US congressional backing for Nafta. . Few congressmen believe Nafta is yet
ripe for passage. According to Mr John Dingell, Democrat chairman of the
House energy and commerce committee, and an opponent of the treaty: 'Every
sign I see is that the votes are not present for Nafta to be carried. Given
that, I think the president is rather prudently holding back.'
Any winning coalition in the House of Representatives and the Senate would
need to comprise most of the Republican members, together with about half of
the Democrats. In the budget vote there was a complete absence of Republican
support, which meant everysingle Democratic vote was needed - Vice-President
Al Gore cast the decisive vote. Building a coalition is a risky strategy for
Mr Clinton, both because Republican votes cannot be relied upon and because
reliance on his opponents would damage his relationship with fellow
Democrats.
'I think the president should take a hard look at whether he wants to pass
Nafta with a Republican majority,' Mr Dingell warned.
About 50 of the 176 Republicans in the House, and perhaps as many as nine of
the 44 Republican senators currently seem likely to vote against the treaty.
The votes of potential Nafta supporters on the Democratic side, notably that
of Mr Richard Gephardt, the House majority leader who wields considerable
political power, remain conditional on the negotiation of satisfactory side
agreements.
Some encouraging signals can be seen across the country however. The
nation's governors, particularly those in the west, appear to be in favour
of the accord. A recent survey by the Heritage Foundation showed 40 of 50
governors strongly support the agreement, with 10 undecided or not
responding.
Many of those in favour are impatient at President Clinton's hesitancy. The
protracted delay in the appointment by the administration of a 'Nafta tsar'
to co-ordinate the lobbying effort is symbolic of inaction. The fact that
the Chicago-based Mr William Daley has been offered the post is one of
Washington's less well-kept secrets, but Mr Daley appears reluctant to say
yes until he is confident Mr Clinton is fully committed to the Nafta.
Supporters of the treaty have also been frustrated by the administration's
behaviour. Industrialists who might be expected to campaign vigorously on
its behalf are angry that only labour and environmental groups have been
consulted about the side agreements.
An administration blunder is also looming in the appeal it is lodging
against a ruling by Washington federal judge Charles Richey. In June, he
upheld a claim by environmentalists that the administration must prepare an
environmental impact statement on Nafta, which could take years.
Initially, the ruling was thought to put the entire Nafta deal in jeopardy.
Negotiators then drew comfort from legal opinion that the ruling was likely
to be overturned on appeal. However, several business lobbyists for Nafta
who have seen details of the administration's intended brief have taken the
unusual step of preparing an appeal of their own.
The Nafta deal is nevertheless not yet lost. Canadian officials said after
this week's talks that the three countries were 'very, very close' to an
agreement, but that 'there are a couple of really tough issues which people
have to think through'.
There is also the conviction among the negotiators that if Mr Clinton
decided that regardless of political cost, the agreement was still i the
national interest, then it could be pushed successfully through Congress.
But doubts remain over his commitment. As one journalist shouted across the
White House lawn at the passing president: 'Sir, have you given up on
Nafta?' He smiled, but gave no answer.

Times must be bad in Britain's cash-strapped football business. The football
season has not even kicked off and yet one first division club has already
put its stadium up for sale. An industrious colleague was so intrigued by
the Financial Times advert offering a freehold stadium for Pounds 5m ono,
that all 24 first division clubs were contacted to see who was selling.
Southend United's Vic Jobson seemed the hot favourite. But he gave the
thumbs down as did the chieftains of other likely candidates such as Luton
Town, Portsmouth, Watford, Oxford, and Crystal Palace. Someone seems to be
telling porkies.

Who said that the days of mad advances and crazed auctions in the British
publishing industry were over? Travel writer Bill Bryson, whose latest work
The Lost Continent has been on the best-seller lists for 27 weeks, has just
hit gold.
Transworld, the UK publishing arm of Bertelsmann, outbid five other
publishers desperate to get their hands on Bryson's next tome. Carol Heaton,
Bryson's agent, says that it is 'one of the most exciting deals' she has
ever been involved in. It certainly sounds like it. Although she refuses to
disclose the size of the advance, disappointed bidders suggest that it is
around Pounds 240,000. That should enable Bryson to buy a large number of
mules or Concorde tickets to help him think up an idea for a book for which
there is no synopsis, let alone a title. How about 'Journey into the
Unknown'?

Roll up, roll up. There are still places available at next month's Trades
Union Congress in Brighton. It is not even necessary to be a member of a
trade union any longer. Have Pounds 25 ready and you are promised five days
of fun with the brothers and sisters.
Top of the bill is Labour leader John Smith, followed by the canny Padraig
Flynn, European Community social affairs commissioner, making his first
appearance on the TUC stage. Fans of retiring TUC general secretary Norman
'Ramblo' Willis will also be anxious to catch his performance as he
struggles with his girth and his syntax for one last time.
The TUC, desperate to drum up some interest in its affairs, is advertising
the event as 'a unique opportunity to hear trade unions discuss the key
industrial issues of our time'. The trouble is that few outside Congress
treat it seriously any more.
Maybe that is the reason why the TUC is now reduced to selling itself at a
bargain basement price of Pounds 5 a day (including VAT).

Is there a strike on? Staff at the Cardiff headquarters of Companies House
were more than a little surprised to get a call from their colleagues at the
Post Office the other day pressing them to settle an overdue bill.
Given that the nine-day mail strike in Wales has pushed many small companies
to the verge of bankruptcy and the business of Companies House itself is
less than 30 per cent of normal, it might have been thought that the excuse
that the cheque was in the post would be sufficient explanation.
The PO ordered Companies House to cancel its cheque and said it would send a
messenger round to collect a new one. Sensibly, Companies House told the PO
what it could do with its messenger.

If Unilever's Charles Miller Smith really has joined the race for the chief
executive's job at Barclays, as is being suggested in some quarters, then it
casts an interesting sidelight on the succession at Unilever itself.
Unilever is headed by a triumvirate consisting of two chairmen - by
tradition, one English and one Dutch - and a third director, known
colloquially in Unilever as the Pope in Waiting. Both chairmen, Mike Perry
and Floris Maljers, are 59, which makes them due to retire in another two or
three years. The third - let us call him the PIW - is another Dutchman,
Morris Tabaksblat. Since it would hardly do for both chairmen to retire at
once, a likely solution is for Maljers to go next May. Tabaksblat then steps
up as Dutch chairman, leaving a slot for the next PIW, who would by
tradition be British.
This is where Miller Smith comes in. At 53, he is a relatively high flier at
Unilever, having been finance director and now running the foods business in
southern Europe. But he is not quite as high a flier as his super-cool
predecessor as finance director, Niall FitzGerald, who is now Unilever's
detergents supremo and is still only 47.
The smart money within Unilever is on FitzGerald for PIW. There would be an
odd advantage to this. The tradition of having British and Dutch chairmen is
rooted in the Anglo-Dutch merger of Lever Bros and Union Margarine half a
century ago. This was originally a way of preserving the balance between the
two sides. But in today's Unilever, it is daft that German or Indian
directors should be barred from the top on grounds of nationality.
And FitzGerald is not a Brit, but an Irishman. The PIW job would set him on
course to be the first non-British/Dutch chairman of Unilever (one previous
chairman, David Orr, was from Ireland, but north of the border). Curious
that such a narrow distinction should make a difference. But that's
tradition for you.

FT  12 AUG 93 / Personal View: How to halt Russia's rouble charade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE HANKE and KURT SCHULER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Contrary to the implication of a recent leader in the FT ('Sabotaging the
rouble', July 21), the actions of the Central Bank of Russia to confiscate
pre-1993 rouble notes should not be viewed as extraordinary. They exemplify
long-established, mischievous tendencies of central banking in Russia.
As the leader remarked, the present confiscation is like the one made under
Gorbachev in January 1991. But the Gorbachev currency confiscation was
nothing new to Russians. Older Russians had suffered a currency confiscation
on December 14 1947. It cut in half the real value of savings exceeding
10,000 roubles (about three months' wages at the time). Further back,
Russian monetary history contains other episodes of monetary mischief.
Indeed, even before central banking began in Russia in 1860, the tsars,
including Peter the Great, frequently debased the coinage.
Yet westerners now advising the Russian government seem to have learnt
nothing from the wretched historical record of political control of money in
Russia. For example, as recently as July 21, the FT ('Climate of reform
brings rouble back from the dead') reported that Jeffrey Sachs was urging
the International Monetary Fund to negotiate an agreement by the end of the
summer to make as much as Dollars 6bn available to stabilise the rouble. In
the same article, Charles Blitzer, the World Bank's chief economist in
Moscow, claimed: 'What we are seeing are the first effects of a step-by-step
stabilisation programme.'
The FT and other leading newspapers have rather uncritically used material
supplied by Russia's western advisers to advocate foreign aid to stabilise
the rouble and reform the Russian economy. That is curious, indeed, because
neither the Central Bank of Russia nor the Yeltsin government has ever had a
coherent programme to stabilise the rouble or reform the Russian economy.
Their policies have been little more than hastily improvised charades to
extract aid from the west.
The charades have, alas, been successful; for example, last month's currency
confiscation came on the heels of a Dollars 1.5bn loan to Russia from the
IMF, which adopted an especially lax set of rules to enable Russia to
borrow.
Russia's western advisers speculate that things would be fine if Mr Yeltsin
would just replace the former communists in the central bank and the
government with 'reformers'. But they neglect two details: Mr Yeltsin is a
former communist, and deep-rooted patterns of thinking cannot be radically
changed overnight. We suspect that one reason Mr Yeltsin keeps former
communists in power is that he has known them for years, trusts them to some
extent, and agrees with much of what they do.
Mr Yeltsin could have reacted to the currency confiscation by declaring the
central bank's decree invalid. He could also have fired Viktor Gerashchenko,
the chairman of the central bank, and Viktor Chernomyrdin, the prime
minister who signed the decree. Alas, he did not take these actions, even
though they would have been popular with the populace. Instead, he agreed to
the main features of the currency confiscation.
Russia's monetary problems go deeper than personalities. They are
institutional: central banking has never provided a sound currency in Russia
for an extended period. As long as Russia has a central bank it is likely to
have an inconvertible currency highly prone to inflation.
The only way to stabilise the rouble permanently is to change Russia's
monetary institutions. That means, first and foremost, abolishing the
central bank and replacing it with a currency board. Such boards have been
tried successfully in more than 70 countries, including part of Russia from
1918-20.
A Russian currency board would hold 100 per cent foreign reserves against
rouble notes in circulation. It would maintain a fixed exchange rate between
the rouble and a suitable foreign currency such as the dollar. The rouble
would then be as stable and convertible as the dollar. The currency board
would force financial rectitude on the Russian government and prevent it
from picking the people's pockets.
When the Group of Seven nations and international financial institutions
confer with the Russian government after the summer holiday season, the west
must start talking monetary sense. Anything less than a currency board will
perpetuate Russia's traditional pattern of monetary mischief and jeopardise
any attempts at real economic reform.
The authors are, respectively, professor of applied economics and a
postdoctoral fellow at the Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore. They are
the authors (with Lars Jonung) of 'Russian Currency and Finance: A Currency
Board Approach to Reform', which will be published by Routledge in September

Men's Changing Commitments to Family and Work
By Kathleen Gerson
Basic Books, Dollars 25, 366 pages
WOMEN AND THE WORK/FAMILY DILEMMA
By Deborah Swiss and Judith Walker
Wiley, Dollars 24.95, 255 pages
'Hi, hon, I'm home,' announces Joe Blow, scooping his infant daughter to his
chest as he enters the kitchen of his home in suburban Nowheresville, USA.
'Say,' he exclaims, 'you've scrubbed them dirty pans from last night. I said
I'd do them, when I got a chance. But I've been so busy.'
'How long am I meant to wait, Joe?' interrupts Mary, his wife, as she dabs
infant dribble from her stylish black business suit. 'They made the place
look so dirty, so . . . untidy.
'And talking of busy,' she growls, 'I haven't exactly been sitting on my
butt, Joe; I was up before you this morning, gave my presentation to the
board this afternoon, rushed home to take the kids to the dentist and did
the dishes.'
'Hey,' says Joe, grinning smugly as he pulls a six-pack of beer from the
fridge, 'is it my fault you've got this crazy female obsession with
tidiness? Now, hon, where's my dinner?'
Mary pours a container of hot, E-Z-Cook, low-calorie, microwaved vegetable
lasagne over his head.
So ends another skirmish on the new frontier of western marital life - that
dangerous, uncharted territory where couples grapple with the ramifications
of one of the biggest social changes of the past three decades - the entry
into the workforce of a large percentage of the married female population.
In the US, about 67 per cent of mothers are now employed or looking for work
 -a radical change from the 1950s, when bread-winning husbands and
stay-at-home wives made up roughly two-thirds of American households.
Yet, as both these books point out, western culture and social institutions
have hardly begun to reflect these changes. 'The unspoken assumption
persists that there is still a woman at home to raise the children and
manage the household,' say Swiss and Walker.
Husbands are not keen to swap the power and freedom their breadwinning
fathers enjoyed for greater family involvement. Wives struggle to be
'superwoman', combining the domestic role their mothers trained them to
assume, and the demands of a job.
The business world, while just starting to pay attention to work/family
issues, generally buttresses these positions: men who take time off for
family matters tend to be viewed as wimps. Women who do so risk being
branded 'mommy trackers' - second-class beings who lack the corporate
commitment needed to get to the top.
These books examine life on this frontier, though from very different
perspectives. Swiss and Walker, professional consultants in the work/family
field, interviewed female Harvard graduates, to see how some of the
'brightest and best' of America's new generation of professional women were
coping with the demands of home and family.
The answer: with difficulty. The book explodes the myth that a modern
professional woman can 'have it all' - a career and family - without
suffering considerable physical and psychological stress.
They conclude that the 'glass ceiling' which prevents women reaching the top
because of their sex is 'buttressed by a maternal wall - a transparent but
very real barrier that significantly hinders a mother's ability to balance
successfully work and family'.
The husband's changing role is the subject explored by Kathleen Gerson, an
associate professor of sociology at New York University, in a book which is
long and ponderous, yet original in subject matter and mercifully free of
jargon.
She maintains that men are growing confused about their position. 'As women
have become almost as likely as men to shoulder the responsibilities of
supporting a family, it has become harder for men to defend and justify
advantages based solely on being born male. The demise of a cultural
consensus on the meaning of manhood has left men in a no-man's land,
searching for new meanings and definitions of maturity.'
Her book, based on interviews with American men from all social backgrounds,
argues that men are responding in different ways, with many seeking to hold
on to their traditional breadwinner privileges, but others taking on varying
degrees of involvement with their families. However, even the most involved
fathers still tend to evade what they consider the routine, dirty work of
childcare.
Both books argue that companies need to be more flexible in allowing
employees to balance the demands of work and home. But the vast majority of
US companies, while playing lip service to family issues, would rather not
get involved - and for good reasons: they view this as a private, individual
matter, fear discriminating against employees with no families, or worry
that greater provisions will hurt their bottom line.
They also note that, however flexible a corporation's policies, many women
who can afford to quit work still do so after giving birth, feeling that
their offspring need greater parental guidance than a child-minder can give.
Of course, a man could provide such guidance. But western culture has yet to
accept the idea of the house-husband, not least because of economics: men
are still generally paid much more than women, so in a one-income family it
makes sense for the man to work.
As Gerson points out: 'Women cannot enjoy equal employment opportunites
until men shoulder equal family obligations, and men are not likely to
become equal partners until women enjoy equal economic opportunities.' In
other words, true equality will be a very long time coming.

FT  12 AUG 93 / Economic Viewpoint: 'Advice given to ministers . . .'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An essay entitled 'Some reflections on the (UK) Treasury' * by that
department's permanent secretary, Sir Terence Burns, is a timely
confrontation with its critics. This is so despite the tendency to argue
both (a) that the critics are misguided, and (b) that their criticisms have
already been taken on board. Inevitably parts look as if they have been put
together from pages supplied by different divisions. But the key sections
bear Sir Terence's personal imprint.
He scores a number of direct hits. For instance: 'The demand for greater
independence of the central bank has come to be the most popular single
answer to the problem of inflation that was once reserved for the exchange
rate mechanism.' He might have added that similar enthusiasm had been shown
only slightly earlier for floating exchange rates and monetary targets. But
should not Sir Terence come clean on where he himself has stood and now
stands on such matters?
His stated complaint, however, is that less than one-fifth of the Treasury's
resources goes into the design and execution of macro-economic policy; yet
nearly all the public attention focuses on this area.
He is also amazed at the importance attached to forecasts. For, as he says:
'The margins of error are well-documented and substantial. Unfortunately
there is little sign of improvement despite significant technical and
analytical developments.' He complains that the 'other 1,400 people in the
central Treasury suffer the frustration of seeing their efforts judged by
the forecasts of 30 or so economists - and even for those economists the
forecasts are only one aspect of their performance.'
Methinks he doth protest too much. Whether the macro-economic side of the
Treasury is regarded as the head or the tail, it undoubtedly wags the dog.
For it is on its doctrines and forecasts that the detailed work of the other
sections hinge. At present that work is governed by the forecast of a Pounds
50bn public sector requirement this year, only running down to Pounds 30bn
in 1997-98.
But how much the budget deficit matters, and over what timescale, if at all,
it needs to be eliminated, is very much a matter of doctrine, theory - call
it what you like. Despite Sir Terence's eyebrow-raising over forecasts, the
Treasury feels more at home with numerical projections than with economic
ideas, which it likes to think are provided by ministers and their
mysterious outside friends.
Although there will always be a few highly technical papers, drawing on the
academic literature, floating around the Treasury on particular matters,
there is still a tendency to regard straightforward discussions of ideas as
so much hot air, and for the inescapable theoretical presuppositions to be
breathed in rather than explicitly discussed.
If the Treasury really wanted to downplay forecasts, why, for instance, did
it appoint a seven-person Panel of Independent Forecasters instead of a
Council of Economic Advisers with a proper secretariat to analyse the
conditions for a sustainable recovery?
No doubt the on-the-record answer is that such decisions are taken by
chancellors and that any advice given by officials is on a par with the
secrets of the confessional, not to be revealed on pain of death.
I have difficulty in convincing some of my newer colleagues that when 'Terry
Burns', as he then was, joined the Treasury as chief economic adviser in
1980, at the tender age of 35, he was regarded as a new broom from outside,
chosen because he was sceptical of the then-prevailing orthodoxy centring
around incomes policy and demand management in real terms.
I was not merely an enthusiastic supporter, but tried to help by
'forecasting' his appointment. Now, however, when the successive and rival
variants of the new orthodoxy, such as the medium-term financial strategy
and, subsequently, the exchange rate mechanism, came unstuck, he should have
been prepared to discuss openly the new mistakes - as the politicians and
journalists who backed the new approach had to do - rather than retreat into
reactionary incantations about the confidentiality of advice given by civil
servants to ministers.
This supposed Ark of the Covenant had already become an ironical incantation
when I was writing a book on the Treasury in the 1960s. The then-Treasury
permanent secretary, Sir William Armstrong, would urge me in the evenings to
see former Tory ministers, who were not then in the habit of writing books,
and he would even contribute some strong indiscretions of his own; but in
the mornings he would lecture me about the confidentiality of advice.
I made the mistake of letting Armstrong have a copy of my manuscript. This
was promptly handed over to Reginald Maudling, the then chancellor. At a
lunch paid for by The Observer (for which I was then working), Maudling came
as near to reading the Riot Act to me as that clever but laid-back
politician had it in his nature to do. A future Treasury minister remarked
to me how lucky I was that I had not had to face threats and bluster from
someone like Lord Hailsham.
There was an interesting sequel. When the next edition appeared, Maudling -
by then in opposition - wrote a friendly and favourable review in The
Spectator. Without any Sir Humphrey at his heels, he made no mention of the
confidentiality of advice and said that for events of which he had personal
knowledge the book was remarkably accurate. Burns, then a rising economist
at the London Business School, was delighted to lap up all the investigative
journalism he could find.
The official defence of ultra-confidentiality has not changed in all those
years. Even the olive branches about revealing more of the background
thinking to parliamentary committees were offered three decades ago. It is
still said that officials will not give good and frank advice if it is to be
disclosed. One could as easily argue the opposite: that advice will be
better if those giving it know that they will have to defend it. The quality
of Fed deliberations does not seem to suffer from public-ation of the
minutes of the Open Market Committee six weeks after it has taken place.
But surely private sector organisations do not deliberate in public? The big
difference is that profit-making companies are held accountable by the
famous bottom line. (Even so, it might have been in the public interest if
more had been known about how the clearing banks had taken their credit
decisions.) The bottom line in Whitehall is the sacking, resignation or
electoral defeat of the ministers who receive the advice.
Nor can I attach the same importance as permanent secretaries do to the same
officials advising politicians of all parties and all hues. Some officials
used to boast how they had prepared bills both to nationalise and
denationalise steel with equal zest. That was in the days when Oxford-type
economists used to teach that ownership was of supreme irrelevance. Even
then, I found such boasting a little nauseating.
What is wrong with many large organisations, and the British government in
particular, is that everyone is responsible for everything and no one is
responsible for anything in particular. My main reason for supporting an
independent central bank is not that it would have the magic power to
maintain low inflation painlessly. It is that one set of people would be
clearly accountable for monetary policy.
Similarly, if officials were accountable for advice to ministers - which
they would not have to pretend was unanimous - outsiders would be able to
judge how far what had gone wrong was due to politicians not taking that
advice and how far it was because that advice was itself wrong.
Such specific allocation of responsibilities would not produce the
millennium, but at least the air would smell fresher.

   From Mr P. WILKINSON, Dr D. LOWRY, and Professor F. BARNABY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, On June 28, 1993, environment secretary John Gummer called for an
extended review period on the commissioning of Thorp and noted that, among
other issues, plutonium production and the impact on the proliferation of
nuclear weapons needed to be investigated more fully.
WBMG Environmental Communications commissioned a report on the issue from
the European Proliferation Information Centre (EPIC) which concluded that:
Thorp would generate 50 tonnes of plutonium for export in the first decade
of its operation, sufficient for 5,000 nuclear bombs.
This would result in about 70 transports a year, representing a significant
increase in terrorist opportunities.
The nuclear regulatory bodies are already stretched as the quantity of
material they are required to safeguard has trebled in the past 10 years
while the number of inspectors has only increased by 50 per cent. They will
be further hard pressed to deal effectively with a growing inventory of
nuclear material.
These findings, among others, were presented to selected secretaries of
state, including Mr Gummer, and to opposition spokespeople. Press reports
quoting government officials indicate that ministers have decided such wider
issues are 'not relevant' to the debate on Thorp, confirming that Whitehall
minds are firmly closed on the matter.

<TEXT>
Sir, Further to your editorial, Friends of the Earth believes the government
has ignored a fundamental flaw in the economic case developed by BNFL for
Thorp. By doing so it has ignored the possible gains to BNFL, its customers
and the UK economy, that would arise by cancelling Thorp.
The economic case that BNFL has put forward for opening Thorp assumes that
it would lose all Pounds 4bn of its projected income if the plant were not
opened. This scenario is completely unrealistic and should not be accepted
without question. It would be far more realistic for BNFL to sell its
customers other spent fuel management services, such as spent fuel storage,
as a direct replacement for existing reprocessing contracts. It is likely
that both BNFL and its customers would benefit from such a switch in
contracts.
For this to happen, however, the government must take responsibility for
bringing the parties to the negotiating table. The government cannot claim
that opening Thorp is justified without conducting a full and open
evaluation of all possible options.

<TEXT>
Sir, There is an elegant way to take the economic 'Nuclear decision'
(Leader, August 5) to operate or to abandon Thorp. The government should
apply its doctrine of 'market testing'. If the profits from Thorp are
secure; if the risks are fully covered; if the government needs money to
plug its budget deficit; then it should sell Thorp and its supposedly
lucrative contracts to the private sector.
Let it run the plant, bear the risks, make profits and pay tax.
If this privatisation proves difficult, as I suspect it would, the
government will have to ask why such an allegedly profitable venture cannot
be sold and recognise the exceptionally unattractive risks it bears for the
nuclear industry.
This has to be better than relying on the conclusions of a report put
together by British Nuclear Fuels.

</HEADLINE>

   From LEON PACZYNSKI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In Andrew Adonis's article on eastern Europe's telecoms ('Call waiting,
for the lucky few', August 4) the remarks of the Polish telecommunications
minister are cited as an example that 'ideological opposition to
privatisation and liberalisation remains strong'.
The minister's comments should not have led Mr Adonis to such an erroneous
conclusion. All too often western observers expect rapid transformations
even in sectors which in the west are still being privatised and
liberalised. It should be recalled that AT&amp;T/Bell and BT were broken up and
privatised only in the 1980s in countries that are fully fledged market
economies.
In countries of the European Community, arguments about the permissible
extent of breaking down 'natural monopolies' is hardly a dead issue,
particularly in Germany.
The EC itself does not require de-monopolisation of voice telephony until
1998. With this in mind, Poland's commitment to competition in
telecommunications services (the Telecommunications Act of 1990 provides for
competition in all services, except international) and ongoing work on
liberalising the tariff structure is rather 'fast-paced' compared with the
rest of Europe.

FT  12 AUG 93 / Letter: Lloyd's controversy not resolved by vote
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ALAN PORTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Richard Lapper's report on the result of the ballot on Lloyd's business
plan may have given the impression that the controversy is over and done
with ('Lloyd's Names vote in support of business strategy', August 11). This
is not the case.
Claud Gurney and his fellow promoters of the July egm represent the 'Angry
Brigade' among Lloyd's Names and were widely warned that their initiative
was ill-timed and likely to be rebuffed.
Those among the action groups who occupy the middle ground felt that peace
should be given a chance to work, and that the weapon of veto should be
reserved for when it was really needed, if at all.
It remains the case that Lloyd's business plan will not succeed unless it
preserves equity between the old and new generations of Lloyd's Names (the
dividing line being January 1 1994), and between individual Names and
corporate capital. The 20,000 Names (62 per cent of the membership) who are
currently members of action groups are claiming compensation not because
they are unwilling to meet 'commercial' losses, but because they are
demonstrably the victims of professional negligence and misrepresentation on
a scale without precedent in the City. All of these problems can be put to
rest and litigation ended, but only if the Council of Lloyd's can come up
with an appropriately large settlement package as a conclusion of its
current disputes initiative. Half measures will not work, and the aggrieved
Names command sufficient votes that, if properly marshalled, they will
prevail.

The quality of the National Geographic 'films' bought in for ITV's Voyager
series has varied. The account of the trip to the Faroes in an open long
boat, for instance, scarcely seemed worth showing since it merely proved
that the voyage was feasible provided you had radio transmitters and the
help of helicopters and modern lifeboats. In today's offering Imran Khan
introduces 'the highest polo match in the world': polo as played in the
Hindu Kush (7.30 ITV).
For the last in an impressive series of Business Matters (8.00 BBC2) the
cameras follow Carey Lewis on the road to Poland and the Baltic states as he
pursues the business of truck brokerage.
When Pandora's Box was first screened its programme about attempts to build
a 'scientific' society in Soviet Russia it seemed to me pretty silly, and I
said so on this page. However, the repeat last week of the episode about DDT
and blind faith in science followed now by anti-science and blind faith in
Mother Nature seemed outstandingly good. Today's target (9.30 BBC2) is
government faith in the mumbo jumbo of economics.

FT  12 AUG 93 / Arts: Successful music in Montpellier - Ronald Crichton
finds that the concert performance of Reyer's opera 'Sigurd' provided the
climax to the Radio France Festival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RONALD CRICHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Each summer Radio France alights in Montpellier with an array of musical
offerings to enhance the already well-stocked musical programme of this city
 -ancient, handsome and thriving, so successfully blending old and new.
Unlike some British towns which are forced to house the arts, in or out of
festival time, in unsuitable buildings, Montpellier is well furnished.
Tucked away in the Corum, a modern complex built partly on a slope and
consisting largely of different levels with wide foyers faced and floored
with pink granite, connecting escalators and staircases, is the
two-seasons-old opera house, the Salle Berlioz. Large, friendly, relaxing,
it is used for concerts as well as opera. There is a smaller theatre, the
old Comedie, proudly sited at the end of a wide boulevard.
This year Radio France brought enough material for 20 broadcasts spread over
five weeks. Concerts included a cycle of Beethoven piano concertos with
Brendel and the Academy of St Martin in the Fields under Marriner. Among the
less familiar things I caught a strange concert given in the Cour Jacques
Coeur, a useful open-air space behind the prestigious Musee Fabre. Strange,
because the two organisations which joined forces to give it, the
Montpellier-Moscow Soloists and the New European Strings, both anxious to
widen their repertories, chose two works either one of which might have
added the spice of novelty but together made an unenlivening evening. Not
the fault of the sound, well founded string playing, quite free of the wispy
undernourished scrape often associated with string tone in the open air.
Bernstein's Serenade is a series of platonic dialogues for solo violin,
strings and percussion based on the Symposium. The five movements, worked
with Bernstein's usual skill, cannot, for all their eclectic pleasantries,
fail to remind one that after-dinner speeches are usually too many and too
long. Dmitry Sitkovetsky was the soloist, Leo Winland conducted.
After the interval Sitkovetsky reappeared as conductor, to introduce the
Carmen Suite for strings and percussion by Rodian Shchedrin, composer of the
ballet The little humpbacked horse. The Carmen Suite is also a ballet,
written for the dancer Maya Plisetskaya, whose formidable technique and
flamboyant personality may well have distracted attention from the tiresome
tweakings and reshufflings of Bizet's tunes strung out in 13 movements, and
from the banal percussion writing.
Operas this year included an open-air staging of Morlacchi's Barber of
Seville and several concert performances, among them Rienzi, Strauss's
Daphne, Puccini's Le villi and, as a climax in the last week, Reyer's
Sigurd. The last-named will be repeated during the coming season, not in
concert but staged, with a partly different cast. Heralded by broadcasts and
a good recording under Rosenthal, Sigurd's time seems to have come again. By
now the old, misleading label 'Frenchified Wagner' stuck on during the years
of neglect that succeeded initial, prolonged success, must surely have been
replaced. And neglect was never total: as record collectors know, the main
soprano and tenor arias turn up again and again. As for the Wagner question,
Reyer's librettists, who started first, worked from a different version of
the Scandinavian legends drawn on by Wagner for The Ring. The main musical
influence is not Wagner but Berlioz, of whom Reyer was a loyal disciple and
friend.
One notable feature of Sigurd is the amount of magic spectacle, recalling
the palmy day of Lully and Quinault. The spectacular element can easily be
overlooked in a concert performance. Librettos were available but with house
lights too low for easy reading, I wonder how many of the large audience
learned about the three Norns, not singers, but dancers, transformed into
swans to draw in a crystal skiff the hero Sigurd and Odin's daughter
Brunehild (whom he has awakened from magic sleep) all the way from Iceland
to Worms on the Rhine, where she will wed Gunther, King of the Burgundians.
A dancing throng of elves, pixies and kobolds bids them farewell.
The conductor, Gunter Neuhold from Karlsruhe, replaced the deceased
Gianfranco Masini. Reyer's first act is leisurely, in need of firmer
propulsion. Indeed the whole opera needed an extra dose of conviction - this
will no doubt come with the staging later on. Meanwhile Neuhold and the
Montpellier Philharmonic showed how much delightful, romantic orchestral
writing there is in Sigurd The title-role was sung by Chris Merrit. The
readiness and address with which this artist undertakes one after another of
the great 19th century tenor roles compels admiration. On this occasion,
alas, the top of the voice was not obedient and the steadiness demanded by
Sigurd's clarion phrases was not always forthcoming. Lower down the stave
one could hear how well Merritt understands the style. The much-praised
Valerie Millot sang Brunehild. She has a lovely presence and a lovely,
lyrical voice without, so far, the declamatory grandeur of, say, a Lubin or
a Crespin. Deeper experience of the role will surely bring what was lacking.
The most polished singing came from the baritone Monte Pederson as Gunther -
every word clear, shaming some of Reyer's compatriots. As his sister Hilda
(confusing name for the character we know better as Gutrune), Michele
Lagrange was warmly sympathetic. As Hilda's witch-like mother Uta, Helene
Jossoud produced pinched, ugly tone with no understandable words. Marcel
Vanaud and Alain Vernhes sang the Priest of Odin and Hagen. As the Bard,
Woytek Smilek made the most of his single scene. The combined choruses of
the Montpellier Opera and the Operas du Rhin made a hearteningly sonorous
contribution to an evening for which, in spite of weaknesses here and there,
one was grateful. Radio 3 will broadcast this Sigurd during the coming
autumn.

FT  12 AUG 93 / Arts: The Country Wife - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When the musical Lust opened at the Haymarket in London last month I thought
it was great fun. Others scorned it because they thought it was a travesty
of the Restoration Comedy on which it was based. Now, we have something very
close to the original in the Royal Shakespeare Company's production of The
Country Wife at the Swan Theatre in Stratford. It is quite possible to like
both.
William Wycherley's play is not exactly a masterpiece. It lacks the style
and situations of the best of Congreve and Sheridan. One of its best scenes
 -the dictating of a letter to an errant wife - is pinched straight from
Moliere. Under Max Stafford-Clark's direction, it is not hilariously funny.
Yet it has enough good parts to make it a joy to watch.
Stafford-Clark plays up the darker side, and who is to say he is wrong when
the piece contains so many cruelties and deceptions? The foppish Mr
Sparkish, played by Simon Dormandy, spits viciously on Alithea when he
realises she is not going to marry him. Robin Soans's Pinchwife not only
locks up his wife in her room, he inflicts physical torture by twisting her
arm behind her back.
To dwell on those aspects alone, however, would be to under-estimate the
production. There are moments when both Sparkish and Pinchwife demand
sympathy. Sparkish seems genuinely hurt at the end and there are times when
one can understand Pinchwife's feelings of jealousy. He may be a hypocrite
and a bully but that does not mean he is wholly insensitive. He can just
about cry with sorrow as well as rage. The performances by Dormandy and
Soans are first-rate.
Comedy, of course, is there as well; it comes primarily from Debra Gillett,
as Margery Pinchwife. Ms Gillett is a real country girl, just as she is
intended to be. She speaks slowly and slightly liltingly. Quite often you
can see a thought coming into her head before she can find words to express
it. When she has an idea she sticks to it. As a country wife, she has no
sense of inferiority but rather of opportunities opening up and it is an
interesting reflection on the play that no-one laughs at her for being
rustic. Even her primitive hair-style goes unremarked. By the second act, Ms
Gillett is in full command of the show: she does, after all, play the title
role.
Where the production is on weaker ground is in the performances of most of
the other women. This is not the fault of the actresses but must be a
deliberate part of the direction. The Fidget ladies and Mrs Squeamish do not
look like women whom anyone would want to seduce. Perhaps that is the point:
it is the women who throw themselves at the men. But it would be fairer to
allow them to be a bit little more attractive and distinctive. Towards the
end, three of them speak almost in chorus like a parody of the witches in
Macbeth. They also drink heavily.
The brilliance of the musical Lust was to elevate Horner, the man who
pretends to have lost his virility in order to gain more access to other
men's wives. Horner is the star part. In The Country Wife he is merely one
character among many. That may be strictly as it should be but it plays down
a very good joke. Jeremy Northam, who plays Horner, must cast his eyes
longingly on what is going on at the Haymarket. The same goes for Daniel
York, as the quack doctor, which in Stratford is not quite the part that it
could be. The most dashing man is Jonathan Phillips as Mr Harcourt, hardly
the central character. Maybe he should switch to Horner.
The production introduces a few songs of its own, which do not materially
affect the play either way, though it's always good to hear the musicians up
in the Swan balcony.
In repertory at The Swan Theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon

BLUE
Derek Jarman
MADE IN AMERICA (12)
Richard Benjamin
APRES L'AMOUR (15)
Diane Kurys
A FAR OFF PLACE (PG)
Mikael Salomon
CHAMPIONS (PG)
Stephen Herek
This is not a review; it is a sneak preview. A month hence Derek Jarman's
new film Blue should reach public screens and before that you may catch it
at the Edinburgh Film Festival (one performance only, August 22). But unlike
Jurassic Park or Last Action Hero, it will not explode on every doorstep in
the glory of Hollywood Hyperama. Nor will there be a movie tie-in industry
of Blue hamburgers, T-shirts and model dinosaurs.
Indeed there is scarcely, in the normal sense of the word, a movie. Blue is
76 minutes of the title colour, projected without change or inflection
beyond the blips and scratches on the celluloid itself. While the soundtrack
blends voices, music and sound effects, the screen just sits there being
blue. While actors recite Jarman's scripted thoughts, and everything from
sea noises to babbling crowds and heart-thumps mix with the verbal musings
on life and death, art and Aids, beauty and pain, the sole balm for the eyes
is that single-colour rectangle. It flickers like a midnight-blue heart
monitor that has lost its pulse line.
You may already be reaching for your desk diary to pencil in 'Avoid Blue on
every available date.' Deny yourself that self-denial. Would you believe
that I sat there in a large North London cinema last week with an invited
audience of 30 in pin-drop awe and silence? Or that Blue is not the
Emperor's new clothes but the Artist's coat of many colours transformed -
concentrated? distilled? - to a blue thought (the film) in a blue shade (the
cinema)?
Blue is about failing sight and intensifying vision. Jarman himself, long an
HIV victim, has deteriorating eyesight along with the other hundred horrors
freely available to Aids sufferers. He details these - wryly, stoically -
through the voice-overs in Blue. But instead of being a condemned man's
litany of last thoughts, the film uses despair as a slipway to hope and
strength and even to a defiant delight. The more insufferably singular is
that 'patch of blue' (Wilde's prison-cell view made movie image), the more
overpoweringly plural are the flickers of thought, sensation and insight
that it provokes.
The film, it could be said, uses an age-old hypnotist's trick. Show your
patients the right kind of rhythmic nothingness - a swinging watch, a
swaying light, a single flickering colour - and they will slip into a
high-productivity coma. By lunchtime they will have remembered their whole
past and possibly been programmed for a saner future.
Blue, though, is more than trickery, though it is never less than hypnotic.
It gives you the freedom to flee if you wish. (Jarman's catalogue of
hospital experiences alone may have you reaching for the mental opt-out
switch.) But finally you do not want to escape. The soundtrack is too rich,
too astonishing: with Jarman's words etching life out of death while Simon
Fisher Turner's music works its eerie, elemental magic. And the imagery -
that pool of colour that beckons and absorbs your attention and then returns
it re-baptised, re-sensitised - is too pliant, too precious to be resisted
by any filmgoer brought up on the rude, unchanging colours of commercial
cinema.
*****
Oh dear and here they are. Sentimental pink for Apres L'Amour. Throw-up
yellow for Made In America. Re-issue rust colour for In Cold Blood. And
plasticky rainbow hues for two production-slate fillers from Disney.
Apres L'Amour and Made In America are interchangeable tales of modern
womanhood. Whoopi Goldberg in the first has a child but no
mate/husband/breadwinner: above all, no papa for her paternally challenged,
sperm-bank-conceived daughter Nia Long. Isabelle Huppert in the French film
has enough men to fill to flood-alert level the average sperm bank but -
yes, you guess correctly - no children.
Movie folk should get together to solve each other's problems on an exchange
basis. In America Mlle Huppert would find a fulfilling, not to say
asphyxiating degree of motherly fulfilment in Miss Goldberg's homey-folksy
milieu: a San Francisco of brittle marriages but teeming wombs, where
pinbright teenagers dash about the land searching for missing parents. In
Made In America the supposed father of Goldberg's daughter is revealed to be
Ted Danson: white (bad), male (worse) and a car salesman (unspeakable).
Soon, though, young Nia is adoring him and so is the initially hostile
Whoopi. By curtain-time - but in the long afternoons of the silly season how
long that is in coming - everyone is looking dewy-eyed at everyone else.
Seeking men, a lonely Whoopi could have gone to France to rent the flat of
Isabelle (Apres L'Amour) Huppert. Here the door is almost off its hinges
with the to-ing and fro-ing of lovers: chiefly, tired but handsome architect
Bernard Giradeau and puppyish-pretty singer-composer Hippolyte Girardot.
La Huppert tries to keep both these relationships going, but you know how it
is. Each man is married; each has a mortgage and children; and when the
crunch comes, it is always 'Ma cherie, ce n'est pas pour toujours.' Plus
which, the heroine herself silently longs for offspring.
Huppert was last seen by us in Madame Bovary. She is still wearing Emma's
look of pale anomie, as of one struck by Life while crossing its busy road
without looking. But where Flaubert supplied his heroine with a good script,
writer-director Diane Kurys (Coup De Foudre, A Man In Love) can only ring
dwindling changes on a soap-operatic plot of musical beds and frustrated
motherhood.
A Far Off Place and Champions are two lost-looking Disney films. The first
answers a question we might have spent our whole lives not pondering. What
would we do if we had to cross the Kalahari on foot, with no provisions of
food or water and 1000 miles to cover to the nearest town?
Young Reese Witherspoon, freshly-orphaned daughter of two white South
Africans killed by ivory poachers, must do this. For company she has only
two young friends - a white boy (Ethan Randall) and a Bushman (Sarel Bok) -
and soon the usual things that happen in deserts are happening. Mirages,
sandstorms, miraculous stumblings upon water and a Central Casting villain
(Jack Thompson) shooting at them from a helicopter.
Laurens van der Post wrote the two original stories on which the film is
based and noted ex-cameraman Mikael Salomon (Backdraft, Far And Away)
directed. But it all resembles 'Walkabout 2: The Plot Runs Out Of Ideas.' We
sense neither the miles nor the days. We feel neither thirst nor hunger. We
marvel only at the leisure-time the characters have in which to play games,
to fall in love, to tell stories and even - surely a first? - to make
blouses from springbok hide.
Champions was called The Mighty Ducks in America and made a small fortune.
Crossing the ocean, it has lost its original title and failed to find a visa
for its original charm. Who in England will jump about at the story of a
little-league ice hockey team managed by a burnt-out veteran (Emilio
Estevez, all of 30) who wants to redeem his long-ago failures as a player?
Director Stephen Herek directs early scenes with the visual snap and
off-wall wit he brought to Bill And Ted's Excellent Adventure. But once the
games start, the fun stops. Don't we just know - can we even doubt  - that
these Minneapolis youngsters will go all the way to a tear-filled finale
when the rank outsiders (they) will beat the glowering, macho favourites:
twice their size, dressed in black and all but accompanied by Spaghetti
Western villain music.
Like a cooling ice-block to the head, you can always apply Richard Brooks's
In Cold Blood to your brain. The 1967 true-life murder story returns to the
ICA, still chilling in its black-and-white docudrama immediacy if still a
touch browbeating in its late-on liberal message-mongering.

FT  12 AUG 93 / Technology: Phones ring higher - The take-off of in-flight
satellite communications
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS and DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The mobile telephone, indispensable tool of business life or scourge of
privacy, is about to take to Europe's air routes.
Air-to-ground telephones, using 1980s analogue technology, have been
available on aircraft in the US for a decade, but now a new range of digital
systems that improve reception and keeps costs low is being marketed in
Europe and the US.
Airlines are always looking for new ways with which to distinguish
themselves from their competitors. Telephones have long been of interest
because, unlike frequent flyer programmes and seat-back televisions, they
can generate revenue for the airline directly as passengers pay for their
calls.
Most big airlines have already experimented with satellite telephones. The
trials were, at best, a partial success because sound quality is variable
and the cost of the equipment and satellite time means the charge to
passengers is an uncomfortable Dollars 10 (Pounds 7) a minute.
Some airlines are, nevertheless, going ahead with full-scale services,
especially where flights are across oceans or polar regions where no
ground-based system is ever likely to be established.
Air France, for example, has satellite telephones on its Paris-Tokyo flights
and has an average of 15 short telephone calls on each trip. Singapore
Airlines is in the process of installing satellite telephones in all its
aircraft.
On the other hand, British Airways decided it would wait until the next
generation of technology arrived. But the waiting may almost be over. Next
month Air France begins trials of a new system for flights within Europe
that will be shared with BA and SAS.
Ground stations are being built by French electronics company Alcatel at
Paris and Lyons in France, Malmo in Sweden, Milan in Italy and London and
Glasgow in the UK.
The airlines have yet to decide which telecommunications company will supply
the service. One candidate is a US company, In-Flight Phone International
(IFPI). Last month it demonstrated its wares in Europe, announcing a deal
with Mercury, the UK operation of Cable and Wireless, and it is constructing
networks in Greenland, Iceland and the United Arab Emirates.
IFPI has already built a system for USAir, one of the biggest domestic
carriers in the US in which BA has a large stake.
The Mercury/IFPI service will use more than 60 terrestrial base stations to
provide a pan-European digital phone service for upwards of Pounds 2 a
minute for international calls.
British Telecom is launching a rival digital service - called Jetphone  -
with France Telecom in the autumn. BT already offers a digital satellite
Skyphone service; its terrestrial service will operate to the same draft
pan-European standards as Mercury's, on frequencies in the 1800 MHz band.
The two rivals are even likely to use many of the same base stations,
operated by the state monopoly in countries which do not permit competition
in voice telephony.
Whoever wins contracts with the airlines will be offering more than simple
telephone calls. The new equipment will allow services such as fax machines,
in-flight shopping and even videos and computer games controlled from a
keypad.
USAir and an even larger US carrier, United Airlines, are already equipping
their fleets with systems that allow passengers to make calls and transmit
computer data to the ground. Both also allow passengers to be contacted in
the air by paging.
GTE, the largest local network operator in the US, is providing the system
for United Airlines. Its GenStar system will use 109 terrestrial base
stations to provide a telephone service over the US at Dollars 2 a minute,
plus a Dollars 2 set-up fee. In alliance with Comsat, the US satellite
agency, it will provide a satellite service at Dollars 8 a minute (plus an
Dollars 8 set-up fee) for calls made beyond the reach of the base stations.
Using seat-back screens or liquid crystal displays, GenStar will also
provide passengers with multi-language video, video-games, entertainment
channels and flight information.
Although telecoms services will be billed direct to passengers through
credit cards, some airlines may want to pay for many of the value-added
services especially for first and business-class passengers.
The upfront cost of providing these services is heavy. Air France plans to
re-equip its entire European short-haul fleet of more than 50 aircraft with
the new air-to-ground telephones. The work will cost Dollars 200,000 (Pounds
135,000) per aircraft but will be worth it, says Marc Dubois, Air France
brand manager in charge of the telephones project.
'On short flights we must offer the chance of a call to everyone,' he says.
'We expect to offer at least one handset per three passengers and would
prefer to have one handset per seat because of the short flights.'
Air France hopes the pan-European network it plans to build with BA and SAS
will start operating next year.
For electronics companies, such plans could prove lucrative.
The market for the long-haul satellite linking equipment appears to have
potential for sales approaching Pounds 700m by the middle of the next
decade.
According to Ron Keens, managing director of Racal Avionics, some 5,000
avionic communication systems will have been installed by the year 2005,
linking wide-bodied aircraft and business jets via the Inmarsat satellite to
the ground.
Looking at the long-haul satellite-based market, Racal appears to have a
six-month lead on the only other competitor, Rockwell Collins of the US.
Keens expects Racal to take about 60 per cent of the market and achieve
sales of about Pounds 350m by the year 2005.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Rupert Hambro, 50, managing director of the J O Hambro merchant banking
boutique, is to take a bigger role in the affairs of Tiphook, the troubled
container leasing group. Hambro has been a non-executive director since
September 1990 and the annual report, coming out later this month, is
expected to reveal he is stepping up to be one of the company's two deputy
chairmen.
Tiphook, which was founded in 1978 by its executive chairman Robert
Montague, has grown into the world's second biggest container leasing
company. However, there has been growing concern about its accounting
policies and the high salaries it has paid some of its executives. City
concerns came to a head last month when the company reported a pre-tax loss
of Pounds 21.8m, much worse than early expectations.
The appointment of Hambro, who is a non-executive director of several
companies ranging from Anglo-American Corporation to the Daily Telegraph, is
part of an effort to restore Tiphook's credibility. Tiphook already has one
a deputy chairman, Eric Goodwin, and it is understood that he will remain an
executive deputy chairman whereas Hambro will be a non-executive. Hambro's
promotion means that he will be the senior non-executive figure on a board
which includes Kenneth Dick, a former executive chairman of Mitchell Cotts,
who is over 80.
Although investors will welcome Hambro's decision to play a bigger role in
Tiphook's affairs, there was some concern at the continuing unconventional
way in which information about Tiphook seems to emerge through leaks to the
press. Many UK fund managers have sold their shares to US investors and
given the size of the US interest in the firm, one analyst ventured that it
might have been better to bring an American onto the board.

FT  12 AUG 93 / Technology: Drugs stick to the cause - A look at recent
advances in the fight against inflammation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTORIA GRIFFITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
New research into the process of inflammation over the past few years may
soon give birth to a promising new family of drugs, remarkable in their
ability to treat conditions as diverse as arthritis, cancer and the common
cold.
Inflammation is such a common human affliction that it runs the risk of
seeming unworthy of notice. The condition can be debilitating and sometimes
even fatal. Crippling pain is associated with inflammation-linked diseases
such as rheumatoid arthritis, asthma and Crohn's disease (inflammation of
the colon), and the condition is often fatal in the case of trauma, organ
transplant rejection and certain cardiovascular complications.
Considering the large number of diseases associated with swelling, current
treatments seem hopelessly inadequate. 'Treatments on the market now mainly
attempt to deal with the pain, but not the cause,' says Dale Cumming, a
senior scientist at the biotechnology group Genetics Institute, and an
inflammation researcher.
A better understanding of the process of inflammation over the past few
years, though, has at least 27 pharmaceutical companies - including Merck,
Wellcome, SmithKline and a host of biotechnology groups - racing to place a
new family of drugs on the market. These new drugs would address the cause
of the swelling, rather than the symptoms it produces.
Much of the research is still at an early stage, but a number of companies
are about to launch clinical trials on the first compounds.
'The potential market for just one of these diseases - arthritis - is in the
billions of dollars each year,' says Roy Lobb, director of biological
research for the bio-technology group Biogen, which is developing its own
anti-inflammatory drugs. 'So you can imagine how large the total market is
for all the diseases related to inflammation.'
Inflammation results from the over-stimulation of the immune system. Under
normal conditions, when a bacterial infection is present in the body, white
blood cells race to do battle in the affected site. Inflammation occurs when
the white blood cells get out of control.
In some cases, such as trauma, the danger of infection may be very real, but
the immune system has over-reacted. In others, such as arthritis, no
infection is present; the white blood cells simply 'misread' the body's
chemical signals and wreak their havoc.
Just a few years ago, scientists began to understand the importance of 'cell
adhesion molecules' in the process of inflammation. When a bacterial
infection invades the body, certain chemical signals are picked up by the
endothelial cells lining the blood vessels and the white blood cells present
in the blood.
Linked to these cells are a group of adhesion molecules - the same sort of
sticky substances which hold the human body together - which react to the
chemical messages. While dormant, these molecules have no impact, but when
turned on they cause the white blood cells to adhere to the endothelial
cells. Once they have stuck, they begin a process known as 'migration': they
crawl out of the blood stream and toward the infected area.
Cell adhesion molecules located on the endothelial cells are referred to as
'selectins', while those on the white blood cells are referred to mainly as
'integrins'.
'I think of the selectins as one half of a velcro strip, and integrins as
the other,' says Daniel Witt, vice-president of technology acquisition for
the biotechnology group Repligen. 'When they are both attached to each
other, they stick tight. Then, the white blood cells move with octopus-like
suction cups to the site of infection.'
If either the integrins or selectins fail to be activated, the white blood
cells are unable to stick, and inflammation is avoided. This is the aim of
the new anti-inflammatory drug candidates, dubbed 'cell adhesion molecule
inhibitors'.
One of the surprising findings of the past few years is that these new drugs
may address diseases not strictly associated with inflammation. Cancer, for
instance, probably uses cell adhesion molecules to spread through the body.
'There is a great deal of evidence linking this sort of process to the
migration of cancer cells from a tumour to other parts of the body,' says
Hubert Shoemaker, chairman of Centocor, a biotechnology group studying
inflammation.
The problem with cell adhesion inhibitors is they run the risk of shutting
down the body's immune system. 'What's driving research now is the challenge
of addressing inflammation while avoiding total blockage of the body's
immunological response capabilities,' says James Paulson, vice-president in
charge of research and development at drug group Cytel.
The gravity of such a shut-down is driven home by the recent discovery of
rare illnesses involving the inactivity of integrins and selectins.
Leucocyte adhesion deficiency (LADI) is a serious illness affecting patients
who lack sufficient integrins on their white blood cells to fight off
infections. They usually succumb to a number of illnesses, and sometimes
die, at an early age.
An even more recently uncovered illness, LADII, involves a selectin
deficiency. While these patients have a weakened immune response system,
they are still capable of warding off many illnesses.
The dichotomy between these two diseases has led some researchers to
theorise that selectins grip less tightly than integrins. 'If this is true,
then it makes sense to target selectins rather than integrins as a way of
diminishing but not completely shutting down the immune system,' says
Paulson.
Another possibility may be to target certain types of integrins only.
Neutrophils, for instance, are short-lived white blood cells. 'If we only
target the integrins on the neutrophils, which last only eight to 12 hours
in the body, we would have a short-lived, and therefore a more controllable,
impact on the immune system,' said Witt.
Because of the different immunological issues involved, it is unlikely that
companies will come up with a single generic pill to treat all illnesses
involving inflammation. But there is likely to be a great deal of cross-over
between research on the diseases involved.
While the new family of inflammation drugs are unlikely to provide
miraculous cures, they do hold a new promise for patients suffering from a
wide range of illnesses. After years of inadequate treatments, these
patients may finally be offered a viable alternative to today's treatments.

FT  12 AUG 93 / People: Talking emerging markets before trend set in
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Arnab Banerji, joint head of emerging markets at Citibank Global Asset
Management, is moving to Foreign &amp; Colonial as chief investment officer of
the new F &amp; C Emerging Markets.
Currently one of the trendier byways of fund management, emerging markets
also represent a return to basics for F &amp; C, which was founded in 1868, with
its first portfolio full of the likes of Egyptian railway loans and Peruvian
5 per cent bonds. Last month F &amp; C set up a new subsidiary, doubling ts
stake in Latin American Securities, a company founded in 1987 by Audley
Twiston Davies, and combining that with its existing south-east Asia team to
form a group managing Dollars 1.5bn in funds.
Banerji, who moved from India to Britain at the age of three, says that he
has been 'talking about emerging markets since 1984 when it was thoroughly
unfashionable'. He is now moving to F &amp; C because it is ' a pure investment
house, where my remuneration is tied directly to the performance of the
funds and where I can concentrate solely on emerging markets, which is what
I love.'
Citibank, where Banerji put together a global emerging markets team,
currently has some Dollars 3bn under management in this sector. Since
joining the fund management side in 1990, he has been involved in the launch
of a number of funds including Latin American Horizons, targeted at clients
of Citi's private bank. More recently, 37-year-old Banerji has concentrated
on institutional investors, bringing in some Dollars 200m on a segregated or
pooled basis, from clients including KLM and Royal Dutch Shell.
Trained as an eye surgeon before a car accident cut short his medical
career, Banerji started in the City as a fund manager for Schroders. In 1986
he moved to Nomura, where he was deputy head of research, specialising in
healthcare and chemical stocks. Three years later he moved to Citicorp
Scrimgeour Vickers as head of equity research.

<TEXT>
Arjo Wiggins Appleton has appointed the distinguished, if media shy, Italian
industrialist Gabriele Galateri to its board as a non-executive director,
replacing Pierre Dufournier, who has retired.
Galateri is managing director of IFIL, a diversified holding company which
is part of the Agnelli group. Scion of an eminent Turin family, Galateri is
thought to be marked out for high office at Fiat, particularly in the light
of changes that may occur in the wake of the corruption scandal sweeping
Italy. The chairman of IFIL is Umberto Agnelli who is expected to take over
at Fiat when his brother, Giovanni Agnelli, steps down next year.
Galateri is a non-executive director of Saint-Louis, which has a 39.6 per
cent stake in AWA. IFIL has recently increased its stake in Saint-Louis to
15.6 per cent. The structure of AWA's board has come in for criticism, as it
was felt that the minority French shareholders wielded excessive power. But
AWA took steps to redress the balance earlier this year, with the
appointment of two British non-executives.

FT  12 AUG 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Going potty -
Leading nappy makers are battling for supremacy with a product aimed at
toddlers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCY KELLAWAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is not a pair of underpants. It is not a nappy. The disposable trainer
pant is a crafty cross between the two. It is also very big business.
In the past few weeks the world's foremost nappy makers have converged on
the UK in a battle for supremacy in this new market. Procter &amp; Gamble,
Kimberly-Clark and Peaudouce are spending several million pounds apiece in
an effort to become number one with the 800,000 British toddlers who are
potty trained each year.
The disposable trainer pant is the result of years of research by teams of
potty training experts. The parent is assured that there will be no messy
accidents as the pants are as absorbent as nappies. The child can enjoy the
independence of being able to pull the pants up and down. And the
manufacturer can look forward to higher sales: the pants cost more than
nappies, so that if they are used as substitutes sales increase, and if they
are used instead of ordinary pants, sales go up further still.
Parents in the US have been been buying these nappy hybrids for four years
and now spend about Dollars 500m (Pounds 338m) a year on them. While there
is little further growth in the US market, the potty training market in the
UK has great potential. On some industry estimates it could be more than 10
per cent of the disposable nappy market, which last year was worth Pounds
420m.
The new product comes at a critical time for makers of disposable nappies.
Sales have grown faster than almost any other consumer product in the past
decade, but with about 9m nappies sold in Britain every day, the market is
now saturated. Last year volumes grew by only 3 per cent and may soon start
to decline as ecology minded parents reconsider whether terry nappies might
not be better after all.
The disposable pant is the manufacturers latest attempt to fight back. For
years they concentrated on making the product increasingly sophisticated,
with different kinds for boys and girls, new slim-line versions and a
proliferation of different sizes. With the trainer pant they are attempting
to increase the total size of the market. The hope is that parents and
children will like the pants so much that they will be in less of a hurry to
move into real underpants.
To capture the market, each of the three players has produced a similar
product, selling for a similar price, launched with a remarkably similar
marketing campaign. Yet the position each starts from is markedly different.
Proctor and Gamble starts from a position of strength as its Pampers brand
has about 70 per cent of the British disposable nappy market, giving the new
Pampers Trainers a head start. Kimberly-Clark sells no nappies in the UK,
although its Huggies Pull-Ups dominate the US market. Peaudouce, which is
marketing under the Up and Go brand name, has neither advantage, but it is
hoping to rely on a unique selling point of its product - an elasticated
waistband.
All three companies are concentrating on television advertising and on
direct mail. Each has a database of parents with children of potty training
age and has started bombarding them with potty training advice, samples and
vouchers. Over the past few weeks the offerings from Pampers and
Kimberly-Clark have gone out: both containing free samples and literature
that makes one wonder how anyone ever managed to get their children out of
nappies without the help of the disposable training pant.
Both come in different models for boys and girls: dinosaurs for boys and
teddies for girls on Pampers Trainers and engines for boys and animals for
girls on Huggies. The Pampers publicity pack includes a set of
potty-training accessories: a sticker for the potty, a cute wall chart to
mark achievements such as 'I can poo in my potty', and little medals to be
awarded for potty triumphs. It also includes a pamphlet written by a
specialist giving advice on how best to potty train children.
Not to be outdone, Huggies promises a free potty training book with the
first purchase. Peaudouce, which has been a little late off the mark, is
planning a Pounds 3m campaign to launch Up and Go this autumn.
This will concentrate on the fact that its nappies have an elasticated
waistband, which apparently make them less likely to sag when full.
All products are roughly the same price (Pounds 7 for 25 pants, compared
with Pounds 7 for about 40 nappies); Huggies and Up and Go come in various
sizes, whereas Pampers Trainers are in just one size.
The battle is particularly intense as all three players know that there is
unlikely to be room in the market for all of them. In the US the success of
Kimberly-Clark has left no space for anyone else. The sheer bulk of the
product means that supermarkets will not want to stock more than one of the
brands. Retailers already have enough trouble displaying Pampers and
own-brand nappies, as each comes in at least four different sizes and two
sexes.
Other nappy manufacturers are looking on in amazement as the big three pour
millions of pounds into the new market. Dave Hall, marketing manger at
Swaddlers, which makes nappies under the Togs brand name, is sceptical about
their chances of success. 'Our market research suggests people perceive
trainer pants as having a limited use. Parents who are potty training may
just go for it and take nappies off totally,' he says.
Careful trial marketing by Pampers and Peaudouce in the Netherlands and
Ireland over the past few months suggests that parents in Europe will pay
the extra for nappies that pull up and down. But whether they actually help
potty train is a moot point.
The Japanese, who potty train their children earlier than their European and
US counterparts, would not be too impressed by the new offerings. They have
been selling disposable training pants for years, but theirs are specially
designed so that the child is uncomfortable when wet, and is trained faster.
Children wearing the western version may be in them for years. But perhaps
that is the general idea.

FT  12 AUG 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Bank embarks on a
gilt-edged campaign - A look at attempts to attract retail and institutional
investment in UK government bonds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Marketing is not among the Bank of England's traditional strengths, yet
through force of circumstance it is having to learn this most central of
commercial skills.
With the government's return to a hefty Public Sector Borrowing Requirement,
the Bank has been forced to sell large amounts of UK government bonds,
otherwise known as gilts. And while the Bank has sometimes in the past been
less than thrilled to hear criticisms of the gilt market, the need to shift
large volumes of stock in recent years has prompted the central bank to
listen rather more carefully to outsiders' suggestions as to how the market
could be improved.
'We do have a marketing strategy for gilts which is directed towards
encouraging long-term interest among the widest possible range of investors
in gilts,' says Ian Plenderleith, the Bank's associate director with
responsibility for markets.
Hence the steady campaign to promote gilts to retail and institutional
investors, both UK and foreign. The Bank's marketing is described by some
bond analysts as distinctly low-key, and in sharp contrast to the flamboyant
marketing campaign seen across the Channel. The French government recently
coaxed FFr110bn (Pounds 12.5bn) out of private investors with the launch of
the so-called Balladur Bond, using a glitzy and aggressive marketing
campaign in the media. The bonds can be held in tax-free savings schemes and
will be convertible into privatisation shares, making them very attractive
to retail investors.
The Bank has no intention of launching a comparable Major Bond or Eddie Bond
(after the Bank's governor). Its own information campaign for private
investors has been rather more subdued, consisting of a simple, clearly
written booklet, provided free to the public. The Bank claims its booklet is
doing well and that over 300,000 small investors have applied for their free
copies.
In addition, between 1,500 and 2,000 small investors now participate at the
Bank's regular gilt auctions using the non-competitive bid system. Their
total bids of around Pounds 10m are peanuts compared with the size of the
auctions (often over Pounds 3bn) but the Bank appears pleased to have
stimulated their interest.
Gilts are free of capital gains tax already, but one suggestion to attract
more retail investors (especially those in the top tax band) has been to
make the income tax-free too, possibly by allowing gilts to be held in
special schemes similar to PEPs and TESSAs. As the government is currently
looking at ways of cutting spending, however, it seems unlikely that such a
tax-break will be introduced - at least in the foreseeable future.
For the big players in the gilt market - the institutional investors at home
and overseas - the Bank has already won praise for the way in which it has
resolutely improved the liquidity of particular benchmark issues. It
regularly sounds out the close-knit fraternity of gilt-edged market-makers
(GEMMs), and then sets out to meet those requests for improved liquidity.
The Bank has also moved to a monthly auction calendar - a change forced upon
it by the sheer volume of stock which needed to be sold - which means GEMMs
have a better idea of when new supply is likely to hit the market.
It has, however, proved harder for the GEMMs to coax the Bank into
considering other improvements. For a couple of years, foreign investors
have begged the Bank to let them settle gilt trades using the two
international clearing systems, known as Cedel and Euroclear. At present,
overseas investors have to settle gilts through the Bank's Central Gilts
Office. While the service provided is very efficient, for the international
investor who already holds and settles a wide range of European government
bonds and eurobonds in Cedel or Euroclear it is far more convenient to have
all their holdings handled under one roof.
The Bank has at last relented on this front, and Cedel, Euroclear and the
CGO are sorting out computer links and administration to make this possible.
Despite the heavy burden of gilt issuance, the Bank has been successful at
selling stock, to domestic institutions and to overseas investors. It has
been helped by an economic climate conducive to investment in fixed income
instruments: inflation has fallen, allowing interest rates to come down and
prompting a rally in the gilt market which started in 1990. But the success
is no reason for complacency: it is essential the Bank ensures that the
products it sells, namely gilts, remain as attractive as possible to a range
of investors, by being prepared to allow the evolution of the gilt market to
continue.

FT  12 AUG 93 / Accountancy Column: Chinese practitioners ready for their
great leap forward - The search for new investors is resulting in radical
reform of accounting practices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GETTING TO grips with business in China is like trying to grapple with
chopsticks for the first time. One slip and the food can easily slide from
the grasp, crashing into a bowl and splashing soy sauce in all directions.
The fledgling role of Western accounting in the world's most populous
country is equally precarious. But a series of initiatives is now poised to
bring about radical reform.
The search for overseas equity is forcing a number of large Chinese
companies to overhaul their accounting practices in an effort to meet tough
listing requirements. Several tens of thousands are adjusting to different
standards for joint ventures already in place.
But from last month, many hundreds of thousands more - supposedly all
Chinese enterprises - have on paper also been required to comply with new,
more internationally-oriented reporting requirements.
Traditional Chinese accounting was well geared to cope with the demands of
the Communist system in the region. Like the equivalent in the former Soviet
Union, it served the purposes of the state effectively. It is less equipped
to cope with changing pressures on the economy in the 1990s.
The system was funds-based. The emphasis was to show how money provided by
the state was used, and how far production quotas were being met. There was
less interest in profits or the long-term viability of an enterprise.
The format was rigidly set out in law, with strict requirements on how
accounts were presented. Mr Neal Stow of Price Waterhouse says that in the
UK, directors may change an accounting treatment to achieve a desired
figure; in China their counterparts had to carry out the transaction itself
in a different way if they wanted to change a number while complying with
the regulations.
The Chinese system was also geared towards statistics, providing data for
economic planning to the different ministries and especially to the tax
authorities.
That means there is extensive financial information on each enterprise,
though most of it is stored manually. The quantity of data, combined with
low staff turnover so that those who prepared the figures are generally
still contactable, means that accountants have been able to re-cast figures
shown in previous years more in line with international standards.
The conversions often produce substantially different results. Mr Meocre Li,
who takes over as partner in charge of Hong Kong and China for Arthur
Andersen next month, says Chinese accounting lacks the concept of prudence,
so there are generally no provisions for bad debts or obsolete inventory.
On the other hand, enterprises were required to make provisions - taken
after profits - for staff welfare, bonuses and other costs. He lists a wide
range of other differences: accounts are not consolidated; foreign currency
transactions are translated at meaningless official rates; depreciation is
far slower than in the West; and there is inconsistent application of
capitalisation of interest charges.
When Andersen re-cast to international standards the accounts of Shanghai
Vacuum as originally reported, net profit rose from Rmb14.7m to Rmb73.4m
(Pounds 8.6m) for the nine months to September 30 1991, and net assets fell
from Rmb293.8m to Rmb198.6m. At Shanghai Chlor-Alkali, net profit fell from
Rmb69.7m to Rmb3.3m for the year to December 31 1991. The smaller net change
at China Southern Glass - cutting profits from Rmb10.4m to Rmb8.5m in the
seven months to July 31 1991 - concealed large variations that cancelled
each other out.
Joint ventures have always been required to report more in line with
international standards. But since July, the Ministry of Finance's
'Accounting standards for business enterprises', with a similar thrust,
theoretically became mandatory for all companies.
Even this new standard differs from international requirements, Meocre Li
stresses, in forbidding full consolidation, for instance. But he says: 'With
world accounting going in one direction, I don't think China has a choice.'
Earlier this year, Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu won a Dollars 2.6m contract from
the World Bank to help design new standards. Mr Ted Lee, the firm's managing
director for China, says it expects to produce about 30 general and special
topic standards and a further 10 for industry sectors over the next three
years. Price Waterhouse has been separately awarded a contract to recommend
changes to financial reporting for banks.
For those trying to interpret Chinese accounts in the past, Meocre Li points
out another difficulty. The country's approach to auditing has been as
different from other parts of the world as its financial reporting.
The standards used by the local certified public accountants (CPAs) vary
considerably, with only vague official guidelines in place. The annual audit
is normally conducted by discussion over just one or two weeks, and up to a
maximum of three weeks for even the largest businesses. There is no history
of auditors verifying evidence from third parties, and they are not
generally present at stock takes.
Meocre Li says there is also a potential conflict of interest under the
existing system, since audit firms are themselves essentially branches of
the Ministry of Finance, to which they report their findings and on which
they rely for information on the enterprises being scrutinised.
Mr Patrick Paul, senior partner elect of Price Waterhouse for Hong Kong and
China, expresses what he calls 'question marks rather than reservations'
about the nature of auditing in China. He wonders how far it is essentially
a Western concept requiring confrontation and probing by junior staff, which
sits uneasily with Eastern ideas of 'saving face' and respect for seniority.
Certainly even for the 'Big Six' firms eager to expand in China, there is
extreme sensitivity over handling businesses' figures. Any qualification
would destroy the chances of a stock exchange listing. Instead, there have
been considerable delays in producing the accounts of companies being
prepared for flotation while adjustments are made.
That has not deterred the international accountancy firms from expanding in
the country. At present, most of their business has come from tax,
investment and due diligence work for foreign clients looking for Chinese
joint venture partners.
Most of the firms say they are unlikely to be generating profits within the
country for at least five years. Stretched to capacity in the meantime,
there are suggestions that they are subsidising their fees to gain important
contracts.
Yet few doubt the need to exploit China's rapid expansion, and have lost
little opportunity to exploit new regulations or test grey areas in the law
in their efforts to expand their operations. Andersen has probably gone
furthest. During most of the 1980s, the firms were only able to establish
'representative offices' which were not permitted to generate income.
Andersen managed to create a wholly foreign-owned business in Shanghai in
1991, which allowed it to hire local people and conduct business. Along with
several other firms, it has now established a joint venture which allows it
to carry out all the functions of local CPAs.
It plans to build a training centre in China, and is already hiring many
young local staff. Mr Ivan Chan, managing partner for China, says the
recruits are highly-skilled. The only problem is the country's one-child per
family rule has created a pampered new generation with high expectations,
making staff retention difficult.
But Meocre Li is confident that the effort will be well rewarded in time. By
the year 2000, he predicts that Andersen in China will be generating
revenues of more than the Dollars 100m a year currently billed in Hong Kong.

FT  12 AUG 93 / Arthur Scargill protests about planned NUM transfers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR ARTHUR Scargill, president of the National Union of Mineworkers, has
protested to the union's Yorkshire area over allegations by one of its
senior officials that the planned transfer of the area's Pounds 5.8m assets
to the NUM nationally through a new trust fund would lead to a financial
crisis and a steep rise in members' contributions, Robert Taylor writes.
In a letter to Mr Ken Homer, the Yorkshire area general secretary, Mr
Scargill also claims that calculations by Mr John Walsh, Yorkshire agent and
assistant secretary, over the proposed transfer are 'based on false
figures'.
Mr Walsh's claim that NUM 'office expenditure' amounted to nearly Pounds
1.7m last year is 'untrue and deplorable'. Mr Scargill says the true figure
is Pounds 793,116.
The NUM's return for last year to the Certification Office, which oversees
union finances, was made over a fortnight ago by Mr Scargill and puts
administrative expenses at Pounds 1.3m and national expenditure at Pounds
1.7m, in line with Mr Walsh's figures.
Mr Scargill questions why Mr Walsh has been able to circulate his document
on the proposed merger of the area into the central union to Yorkshire
branch officials and members when the decision to back the transfer of
Yorkshire's funds to head office was 'binding on all officials'.

FT  12 AUG 93 / Insurers attacked over profits rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Consumers' Association yesterday accused insurance companies of making
profits at the expense of customers.
The criticism came after two of the biggest companies reported strong
increases in profits, following sharp increases in premiums in the past two
years. Ms Jean Eaglesham, head of money policy at the association, said
consumers were footing the bill for the companies past mistakes.
The country's biggest composite insurance company, Commercial Union,
yesterday announced pre-tax profits of Pounds 65.5m for the half year, while
General Accident posted profits of Pounds 126.2m on Tuesday.
A third company, Royal Insurance, is expected to report profits today, while
two others - Sun Alliance and Guardian Royal Exchange - will follow suit in
the next four weeks. All were in the red at the same stage last year.
Profits have been achieved because of a decline in weather-related and
mortgage indemnity claims, cuts in costs, and increases in premiums,
especially those paid by homeowners and motorists. Rates have increased by
about 20 per cent a year on average.
Ms Eaglesham said insurers had lost money not because past premiums had been
too low but because they had 'misread the housing market' and made
ill-judged expansion.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
INTEREST IN buying houses has fallen to its lowest level since March, a
survey by Gallup says.
Gallup's index measuring keenness to enter the housing market fell to 9.81
last month from 12.93 in June. The index is based on interviews with 2,000
people who are either potential first-time buyers or who already own a
house.
Although interest in moving house had picked up from last year, Gallup said
'full recovery (in the housing market) is still some way off'. Fear of being
made unemployed together with the large numbers of people with mortgages
greater than the value of their houses was holding back any significant
increase in transactions.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A TURKISH Cypriot businessman serving a five-year jail sentence for tax
fraud is believed to have fled to northern Cyprus after failing to return
from weekend home leave.
It will embarrass the authorities, who are already smarting from former
Polly Peck chairman Mr Asil Nadir jumping bail and fleeing to northern
Cyprus three months ago while facing theft charges over his collapsed
business empire.
Mr Gultekin Mustafa Ben left Stanford Hill open prison in Kent, on Saturday
morning for a five-hour family visit.
A police spokesman in northern Cyprus, which has no extradition treaty with
the UK, told Reuters news agency that a man calling himself Mr Ben arrived
there on Sunday with his wife.
Mr Ben was jailed for five years and fined Pounds 100,000 in March after a
five-month trial relating to a Pounds 12.5m VAT and PAYE fraud involving
clothing factories, illegal immigrants and false invoices. Mr Ben, an
accountant, had set up bogus businesses selling false invoices to his
clients.

FT  12 AUG 93 / Defence agency shows loss of Pounds 449m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Defence Research Agency, adviser to the Ministry of Defence, has
suffered a loss of Pounds 449m in property and other fixed assets in its
transformation from government agency to a more autonomous trading fund.
The agency's overall loss for 1993 was Pounds 409.8m compared with a profit
of Pounds 48.4m in 1992.
The figures, published yesterday, were prepared as a dry run for future
publications of audited annual results for the agency. The agency has been a
trading fund since April which gives it similar accounting obligations to
those of a company.
The loss came when management at the agency identified assets surplus to its
needs and returned them to the MoD without a cash payment in return.
It means the DRA starts as a trading fund without many of the overheads it
had as a government agency.
Turnover in 1993 was Pounds 795.8m, with the agency developing and testing
technologies mainly for the MoD. These include guidance systems for bombs
and missiles, new forms of radar and a lightweight night-vision system that
is already being sold to fire services for use in smoke-filled buildings.
Mr John Chisholm, the agency's chief executive, said: 'Up to one-third of
physics-based applied research in the UK comes from the DRA.'
He said the organisation would set up centres for the exploitation of
technologies for both military and civilian use, so that it could
'contribute to the wider economy'.
Apart from the night-vision camera for fire-fighting, the agency is also
working with the Civil Aviation Authority on using military aircraft
tracking systems to improve air traffic control.
Mr Chisholm acknowledged that defence cuts were likely to reduce the
agency's income by Pounds 100m a year 'over the next few years'.
A package of 2,000 job cuts among 10,500 staff is under way.
Most of the cuts have been among administration staff as part of a strategy
to reduce the proportion of support staff at the agency from two-thirds to a
third of employees.

FT  12 AUG 93 / Timex brings forward Dundee plant closure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TIMEX IS planning to close its troubled printed circuit board plant in
Dundee within weeks, several months earlier than expected, the company said
yesterday.
But the closure of the factory, after 47 years of operation, looks unlikely
to end one of Britain's longest and most bitter industrial disputes for many
years, as strike leaders vowed to step up a boy-cott of Timex products in
continental Europe and North America.
'The company's decision to shut the plant reflects the success of our
world-wide campaign against them,' said Mr Charlie Malone, Timex strike
committee chairman. 'We don't intend to end it until the name of Timex is
tarnished.'
The strikers will meet today to discuss their next moves.
Timex management announced two months ago its intention to stop production
in Dundee by the end of the year after workers rejected a peace formula to
resolve the eight-month-old strike which followed their mass dismissal for
refusing to accept cuts in their terms and conditions of employment. The
strike was accompanied by large demonstrations in Dundee, with occasional
violent scenes outside the plant.
The company has decided to bring forward the date of the plant's closure and
yesterday 93 workers who replaced the strikers received their redundancy
notices.
Timex said the remaining 170 replacement workers and 97 clerical and
managerial staff would also go as soon as Timex's business customers have
found alternative suppliers for printed circuit boards.
The AEEU engineering and electrical union is unlikely to continue
recognising the dispute and paying the strikers Pounds 30 a week once the
plant is shut, although national officials want to ensure that Timex honours
legal obligations over the pension fund for its ex-employees. The strike
committee's fund-raising efforts in Britain and elsewhere are said to have
produced about Pounds 200,000.
Over the past four weeks a delegation has been travelling around the US,
building support to confront Timex through a boycott of its products.
Contact has also been made with unions in Mexico, the Philippines and France
where Timex continues to have production plants.
A number of US unions including communication workers, steel workers, miners
and machinists have mobilised backing for the Timex strikers.
The AFL-CIO union federation in Washington is hoping the strike committee
will be able to give evidence to a congressional committee on its
experiences to support the striker replacement bill which US unions hope
will secure congressional approval this autumn.
That measure is designed to make it unlawful for a US employer to sack all
its workers if they go on strike. Mr Malone also said a legal action against
Timex in the US courts was being discussed under the 1988 Omnibus Trade Act,
which prevents US companies discriminating against workers in their overseas
plants.

FT  12 AUG 93 / Supermarkets call shots in lager price war: Tesco's
discounting of Stella Artois imports was the start of a squeeze on brewers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NATIONAL BREWERS, whose profits are already under pressure from increasing
competition in the pub trade, are now coming under attack from a fresh
source.
Imports by supermarket groups of well-known lagers at substantially lower
prices from continental Europe threaten one of the brewers' fastest-growing
and most profitable markets.
Tesco led the way. It obtained supplies of Stella Artois, the Belgian beer,
through its French subsidiary Catteau instead of through Whitbread, which
brews the lager under licence in the UK.
In a four-week promotion that has just ended, it offered a 24-pack of 25cl
bottles for Pounds 9.99p - a discount of 25 per cent on the normal UK price.
'We sold more beer than we have ever sold on any previous promotion,' said
Mr David Wild, the Tesco commercial director who is responsible for drinks.
Whitbread has responded to the threat by offering to supply Stella Artois to
Tesco in continental-style packaging. But Mr Wild said: 'As yet, they can do
so neither at a price that is attractive nor in the volume we want.'
Tesco intends to repeat promotions of imported Stella Artois - and on Monday
to begin a series of similar offerings of other popular continental lagers.
J. Sainsbury, now offering imported Stella at Pounds 9.95p for a 24-pack,
said it was considering obtaining other brands from mainland Europe.
Mr Graeme Eadie, analyst at NatWest Securities, said: 'The Tesco promotion
represents the first skirmish in a take-home beer price war; the first move
in a process which will permanently reduce the profitability of UK brewers.'
The creation of the European single market and its encouragement of
cross-border trading has generated the process. Tesco said its decision to
buy Stella through its French subsidiary was partly defensive. 'We are very
concerned about the effect on our business of the increase in personal
allowances for cross-Channel shoppers, who can buy beer more cheaply because
of lower rates of duty on the Continent.' Mr Wild said.
But tax is only one element - though the biggest - in the difference between
the retail price of beer in the UK and on the Continent.
Lower production costs, in raw materials and packaging as well as scale
efficiencies, contribute to cheaper continental retail prices.
More importantly, lagers which are regarded and priced as standard products
in the rest of Europe are heavily marketed as premium products in the UK,
with three times greater profit margins.
Having established the popularity of the brands, the UK brewers may
increasingly fail to reap the rewards. Even with UK duty rates, retailers
such as Tesco and Sainsbury can exploit the price advantages of
cross-Channel supplies to undercut normal UK prices while retaining a
useful, if lower, profit margin.
Mr Eadie said: 'So long as price differences remain between the UK-brewed
and continental-brewed versions of the same brand, no UK brewer can regard
premium pricing as secure.'
Apart from Whitbread's 'reassuringly expensive' Stella Artois other
vulnerable beers could be Courage's Holsten and Scottish &amp; Newcastle's
Beck's if the present trickle of imports turns into a flood.
The brewers' ability to combat such an influx appears limited.
Supermarkets dominate the growing take-home market in which premium lager
accounts for a third of sales. If brewers ignore a concerted price challenge
in the sector, they will lose volume. Yet reducing prices would have not
only an immediate impact on profits but a knock-on effect on the whole
pricing structure of the market.
If the brewers are unable to maintain the price level of premium lagers, the
price of standard lagers, such as Whitbread's Heineken and Bass's Carling
Black Label, will come under pressure.
Consumers meanwhile must be smacking their lips in anticipation.

FT  12 AUG 93 / Headhunters back on the trail
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCY KELLAWAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RECESSION took a heavy toll from headhunters, with the size of the
European executive search market shrinking by nearly a quarter last year,
says a report from the Economist Intelligence Unit. But the market has
stabilised and is forecast to pick up next year.
The report estimates that consultancy income last year was about Dollars
700m-Dollars 800m (Pounds 475m-Pounds 545m) - 20 per cent to 25 per cent
less than the previous year. The fall was most marked in middle management,
where headhunters' revenues dropped by more than 40 per cent. Headhunting of
top-level executives was relatively unaffected.
The report shows that the structure of the industry is changing, with
consultants increasingly offering multinational clients cross-border
searches. Headhunters are also diversifying into related areas such as
interim management, management audit and assessment, executive selection and
headhunting non-executive directors.
The survey ranks headhunters by revenue, and names the Swiss consultancy
Egon Zehnder as the largest with nearly 10 per cent of the market. It is
followed by GKR Neumann and Amrop International.
The two largest markets are Germany and the UK. In Germany the top 10
companies have combined revenues of Dollars 93m. The corresponding figure
for the UK is Dollars 78m. The top 10 consultants' revenues in France, the
third-largest market, were Dollars 43m.

FT  12 AUG 93 / Maxwell group pensioners earn Pounds 55m from share sale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FORMER MAXWELL company pensioners have earned Dollars 83m (Pounds 55.7m)
from the sale of shares in Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, Lehman Brothers,
the US-based investment bank, said yesterday.
The sale was part of a secondary offering in the US managed by Lehman. As
part of the offering, the bank sold its stake in Teva Pharmaceutica, which
it had acquired following the late Robert Maxwell's default on loans it had
extended to his personal interests.
The holdings of the liquidators to the Maxwell-owned fund management company
Bishopsgate Investment Management and those of Lehman Brothers were sold in
the form of 8m American depository receipts.
The pensioners' shares are those that were returned last year by National
Westminster Bank. NatWest had received them as collateral for a loan to
Robert Maxwell's personal interests but they had been registered in the name
of BIM. BIM managed pension assets exclusively. Liquidators to BIM had
argued that NatWest should have known the shares were not Robert Maxwell's
to pledge.
Robson Rhodes, liquidators to BIM, is challenging Lehman's ownership of all
or part of the shares.
The offering, in the form of depositary receipts consisting of 10 Teva
Pharmaceutica shares each, raised a total of Dollars 157m net of
underwriting expenses.
Robson Rhodes has relinquished any claim to ownership of the shares,
allowing them to be sold to investors with a clean title. However Robson
Rhodes said it will instead pursue Lehman Brothers and related entities for
any claim it believes it may have.
Lehman's holdings consisted of 2m shares registered in its own name and 2m
registered in the name of Lehman Brothers Nominees, indicating that they
belonged to some owner other than Lehman Brothers. A portion of the shares
represents Dollars 35m overcollateralisation of the loan from Lehman
Brothers to Robert Maxwell. That sum is being contested.
In addition, some of the shares were obtained by Lehman Brothers through a
stock-lending arrangement. The status of the arrangement is also being
questioned by the liquidators.
Lehman Brothers said that at present, there are no legal proceedings
connected with the Teva shares.

FT  12 AUG 93 / Cardiff mail strike called 'unnecessary'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ROYAL MAIL yesterday denounced as 'totally unnecessary' the nine-day dispute
by 900 postal staff in Cardiff over the introduction of a new shift system.
The dispute has paralysed the letter service in south Wales, and Royal Mail
has called on the Union of Communication Workers to put a proposed peace
formula to the strikers for their approval.
Management said the proposed framework agreement it negotiated with the
union's executive had been turned down by the local branch officials.
Royal Mail said: 'There is no justification for this dispute. A framework
for a settlement has been worked out between Royal Mail and UCW national
executive members. We are deeply disappointed this framework has been
rejected by the local UCW leadership who must shoulder the blame for the
continuation of this dispute.'
Mr Les Parry, an executive member, denied the union had agreed any
framework. He said: 'Negotiations have been going on slowly but there has
been nothing to put to the union locally.'
Royal Mail said last night that about 2,500 postboxes had been sealed. It
advised those wishing to send documents to Companies House in Cardiff to
send them instead to Companies House in London.

FT  12 AUG 93 / Cuba tipped as holiday hot spot
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO LARGE travel companies yesterday designated Cuba as the next mass-market
holiday destination and announced programmes which will immediately
quadruple the number of UK visitors to the island.
Airtours, the second-largest tour operator, is offering two-week holidays at
the beach resort of Varadero from next May, with prices from Pounds 299 to
Pounds 1,399. Mr Richard Carrick, Airtours marketing director, said the
resort has several foreign-managed hotels.
Mr Carrick refused to say how many holidaymakers Airtours would take to
Cuba. He said, however, that the company would offer weekly charter flights
from Gatwick via Manchester to Varadero from early May to mid-October. This
suggests that Airtours plans to fly about 8,000 travellers to Cuba during
this period. Mr Carrick said the programme would be extended into the winter
if it proves successful.
Unijet, another tour operator, said it also intended to announce a programme
to Cuba. Mr Chris Parker, Unijet chairman, said the company planned to take
1,000 holidaymakers to Cuba next year and hoped to increase its capacity to
3,000 a year.
Mr Carrick said authoritative statistics were not available, but an
estimated 3,000 UK residents are believed to have visited Cuba last year.
The island is a popular holiday destination for Canadians, Germans and other
Europeans. The growth of Cuban tourism has been hampered, however, by
hostility from the US. Mr Carrick said he believed the UK market had been
slow to take off because attitudes to Cuba had been affected by Britain's
close ties with the US. He said tensions between the US and Cuba had led to
a 'somewhat jaundiced' view of the island in the UK. Americans made the
island a playground of the Caribbean in its pre-Communist days.
Mr Carrick said Airtours would not hide Cuba's problems from its customers.
Brochures would tell them that buses in Cuba were irregular, that taxis were
sometimes hard to find and that petrol was rationed. He said he had been
assured that visitors to Varadero would have enough petrol for their hire
cars.

FT  12 AUG 93 / Unions' links with Labour discourage potential members
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRADE UNION links with Labour represent the biggest single factor
discouraging people from joining unions, according to a survey of health
service and local government employees. The strongest attraction is union
support in disciplinary proceedings.
The survey, by an official of National Union of Public Employees the
public-service union, which has now merged into Unison, was conducted before
the last general election. It adds a further twist to the struggle by most
big unions to resist a reduction in their power within the party, due to
reach a climax at this year's Labour conference.
The financial and consumer services, such as cheap holidays and insurance,
which many unions have developed over the past decade, come last in a list
of eight reasons for joining a union.
The first three are all associated with legal support for the individual
employee - advice on discipline, legal assistance and advice on grievances -
with pay negotiations coming fourth.
Mr Allen Kerr, who conducted the survey, says the low priority attached to
pay is probably due to centralised public-sector negotiations.
Just under 300 questionnaires were returned from union members and a similar
number from non-union respondents. Some 28.4 per cent of non-union
respondents said that union support for Labour was a 'very important' factor
in not joining. The second most common explanation (24.9 per cent) was
because unions are no use to part-timers and the third most common (22.8 per
cent) was that unions do not understand the problems of working women.
Research for the TGWU general union by Warwick University says that the
union's female membership is growing fast. About 18 per cent of the 1.1m
members are women but 26 per cent of all new members are women. Only 6 per
cent of lay representatives are women.
The survey found that the union was failing to recruit members in growth
sectors 'because workers do not see unionism as relevant to them'.
New members are coming predominantly from traditional sectors - 21 per cent
in road transport, 8.1 per cent in food, drink and tobacco, and 5.6 per cent
in other manual occupations. The rest cover a very broad spread of
occupations.

FT  12 AUG 93 / Bid rivalry raises hopes for sold-off coal mines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOPES THAT the private sector will take on discarded British Coal mines rose
yesterday as the corporation revealed that 10 companies had submitted bids
for the five latest collieries to be put out to tender.
The pits, the second batch to be advertised, have drawn at least one bid
each, and Betws in south Wales is thought to have attracted three. Most of
the 10 bids involve mining, although two or three are thought to suggest
only the use of the land and assets.
The first batch of four mines attracted only one bid involving mining.
British Coal is advertising 19 pits in all. Bids for the remaining 10 are
subject to various deadlines over the next weeks.
The latest batch of five, for which the deadline was Monday, is thought to
be the most attractive because of the pits' location and coal quality.
Although British Coal yesterday would not reveal the bidders' identities, it
is thought that Betws has attracted offers from Ryan International and a
consortium led by Mr Malcom Edwards, former British Coal marketing director,
as well as a management buyout team.
Mr Edwards is also interested in Markham Main and Rossington in Yorkshire.
He is thought to be facing competition at both from RJB Mining.
RJB is also thought to have bid for Clipstone and Bevercotes in
Nottinghamshire.
A report by McCloskey Coal Information Service yesterday predicted that 20
per cent of electricity generating capacity will be closed in the next five
years, most of it coal-fired. It also suggests that British Coal will have
to offer generators coal at less than half the price of existing contracts
if it is to win the additional sales essential for keeping reprieved mines
open. 'It does not augur well for any of the reprieved mines or indeed in
the short term for any third-party (independent) supplier,' it says.
However, the report concludes that 'there will still be a substantial market
for coal-fired plant to supply during the winter months for many years to
come'.
Meanwhile British Coal yesterday denied claims by officials of the National
Union of Mineworkers that it wants to contract out all jobs at its Tower
mine in south Wales. It is, however, seeking 200 voluntary redundancies
among the 500-strong workforce in the autumn.

FT  12 AUG 93 / Up to 25% of shops robbed in past year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A QUARTER of shops in some parts of London have been victims of a robbery or
attempted robbery in the past year, according to a report published
yesterday by the Police Foundation, the independent research organisation.
The report, in conjunction with the University of Sheffield, highlights
crime affecting retailers. Mr Stanley Kalms, chairman of electrical retailer
Dixons, warned in June that shops were being forced to adopt 'vigilante
tactics' on crime, which was costing Dixons alone Pounds 20m a year.
The report says a quarter of London shopkeepers and 17 per cent in the
Midlands had experienced a robbery or attempted robbery with a knife, gun or
imitation gun in the last year.
The report also highlights a lack of contact between the police and some
victims. Although offences such as robbery were normally reported to the
police, shopkeepers in the Midlands said they rarely had any other contact
with their local police and many had negative views of policing.
Mr James May, director-general of the British Retail Consortium, said the
report reinforced the consortium's own findings. He said a nationwide sample
of 4,000 retailers with fewer than 50 staff found 1,317 incidents of serious
violence reported last year.

FT  12 AUG 93 / Funds 'at risk' in opt-out schools
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PUBLIC MONEY is at risk in grant-maintained schools because of inadequate
audit arrangements, the Audit Commission says in its annual report today.
The claim by the local-government spending watchdog sparked a row yesterday
when it was denied by the government, and Labour called for the Commons
public accounts committee to investigate the allegation.
In England and Wales, grant-maintained schools - which opt out of local
authority control - are allowed to appoint their own external auditors. Sir
David Cooksey, commission chairman, described this arrangement as
'unprecedented in the public sector'.
Although it is accepted practice for companies to appoint their own
auditors, Sir David said extra 'checks and balances' were necessary in the
public sector because boards of governors were not answerable to
shareholders.
He said: 'Large sums of money are being given to those who have little
experience of handling public finance. In some cases funds may be misused or
even misappropriated.
'The rights of the public to challenge things which are going wrong and have
auditors to issue public-interest reports have been withdrawn.'
He said external auditors should be appointed independently, and audits
should include value-for-money reports.
Mr Eric Forth, the schools minister, responded: 'The audit arrangements of
grant-maintained schools are entirely appropriate and proper.' He said
opted-out schools had annual external audits, while the Funding Agency for
Schools, the government body created by this year's Education Act, would be
able to commission value-for-money studies from the Audit Commission.
The National Audit Office, the government spending watchdog, also has to
report to parliament on the schools, he said.
Mr Forth suggested that the commission was looking to create more work for
itself. He said: 'There appears to be a certain amount of 'vested interest'
here. The Audit Commission is, perhaps understandably, disappointed that its
bid for a monopoly role in (grant-maintained) schools was rejected by
parliament during consideration of the recent education bill.'
Sir David denied that the commission wanted a monopoly role. He said his
concern was that auditors for schools should be externally appointed.
Mrs Ann Taylor, shadow education secretary, said that the schools should
have been made answerable to statutory audit procedures.
GCSEs, introduced to replace O-levels and CSEs in England and Wales in 1988,
have been 'on the whole, fair and successful', the Schools Examination and
Assessment Council said yesterday.
It said in a report that implementation of the qualifications had improved
during the past five years. But it queried whether all the examining bodies
were applying the same standards.

FT  12 AUG 93 / BBC staff vote against 1.5% imposed rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SEVERAL thousand journalists and technical staff at the BBC have voted to
reject a 1.5 per cent pay offer, the National Union of Journalists and
Bectu, the technicians' union, announced yesterday.
Staff voted by 4,867 to 648 - 87.7 per cent - against the deal in a postal
ballot in which 41 per cent of those eligible voted.
The BBC imposed the settlement at the beginning of this month by announcing
that the rise would be in August pay cheques.
At the time Ms Margaret Salmon, director of personnel, pointed out that the
government had ruled that public-sector settlements should be restricted to
1.5 per cent of the wage bill.
Mr Roger Bolton, Bectu's national industrial officer, said yesterday he was
writing to Ms Salmon asking for an urgent meeting to re-open negotiations.
A further ballot on industrial action has not been ruled out.
BBC unions intend to challenge the pay rise of 1.5 per cent. Mr Bolton
yesterday said the BBC was trying to have it both ways - claiming to be a
public-sector organisation when it suited. Mr Bolton said that at a recent
industrial tribunal the BBC claimed not to be a public-sector organisation
under European Community law.
The unions will also try to negotiate on a number of non-pay issues such as
rights to a meal break after six hours' work, a limit to the number of hours
worked in any one day and better terms for short-term contract workers.
The BBC said it had made clear there was no scope to increase the overall
amount but offered further talks on others aspects of the claim.
Reuters Television, the television arm of the news and information group,
yesterday announced the loss of 77 posts, 40 of them through redundancies.
The job losses at what was Visnews are mainly in areas such as technical
facilities, cassette syndication and duplication.

FT  12 AUG 93 / Labour accuses the government of undermining local democracy
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR yesterday accused the government of undermining local democracy by
expanding the powers and membership of quangos (quasi-autonomous
non-governmental organisations).
Mr Doug Henderson, shadow local government minister, said a Labour survey
suggested that quangos in some parts of Britain would soon have more members
than local authorities.
Quangos would be further boosted by more schools opting out of local
authority control, and more hospitals choosing to operate as self-governing
trusts.
The Audit Commission has announced a review of probity in local government,
to report in November.

FT  12 AUG 93 / VW to cut list prices of cars
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VOLKSWAGEN, struggling to reverse a weakening sales performance in the UK,
is cutting list prices of its cars by an average of 4.1 per cent from
September 1, John Griffiths writes.
But with the exception of diesel models, where prices are set to tumble by
up to 11 per cent, the amount paid by customers is likely to be unchanged
because the reductions are being achieved mainly by a cut in dealers' profit
margins from 15 per cent to 10 per cent, reducing their scope for
discounting.
Volkswagen, which is among the last of the key players in the UK car market
to cut dealer margins to 10 per cent, said it believed its rivals were about
to launch an autumn round of price increases. VW is unlikely to impose a a
rise before the end of this year.

FT  12 AUG 93 / Fraud protection urged for home banking clients
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BANKS SHOULD be forced to accept liability for unauthorised transfers of
money from the 1m accounts operated remotely from homes and offices by
computers, the Consumers' Association said yesterday.
It said that the committee reviewing the code of practice for banks, headed
by Sir George Blunden, should introduce an amendment to ensure that banks
take responsibility for cases where money is transferred wrongly because of
mechanical failure or computer hacking.
The code, which is to be amended from next March after two years of
operation, at present allows banks to make customers sign clauses which
indemnify the bank against responsibility for computer errors and fraud,
said the association.
Bank of Scotland, which was a pioneer in home banking with its Home and
Office Banking System (Hobs), said it disclaimed responsibility for losses
due to the failure of equipment, or 'circumstances not reasonably within the
bank's control'.
The association said that the 1989 Jack Committee on banking conduct had
excluded home banking from its draft code, but there were now 1m users of a
growing service and it was time that banks were made liable for unauthorised
transactions.
It criticised banks for their approach to the code as a set of guidelines
rather than a commitment to customers. This was 'misconceived and out of
step with thinking in other parts of the services sector'.
The association said that the code should also be amended to ensure that all
banks pre-notify charges to customers - a service provided by Bank of
Scotland, Clydesdale Bank, National Westminster, TSB Group and Norwich &amp;
Peterborough Building Society.
Ms Jean Eaglesham, the association's head of money policy, said customers
were 'fed up to the back teeth' with banks 'dipping into their accounts
without notice to extract charges and interest'.
All banks should include interest charges among the 'charges on charges'
which are barred by the code in cases where a customer is forced into
overdraft by other account charges, the association said.
However, Barclays, Lloyds and Midland said they did not believe there was a
strong demand from personal customers for charges to be pre-notified. All
said they had had few complaints.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SHELL, the oil company, could face union calls for a consumer boycott of its
products. The unions will step up their campaign against de-recognition in
the oil industry at a special conference in London on Wednesday.
BP, Esso, Mobil and Shell have all derecognised unions over the past two
years but Shell is being targeted over plans to cut 100 jobs at its Shell
Haven refinery in Essex, and the introduction of personal contracts for the
remaining employees.

FT  12 AUG 93 / TUC urges rethink on monetary union
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Trades Union Congress is calling for a 'reassessment' of the convergence
criteria for European economic and monetary union, and for the inclusion of
targets on economic growth and unemployment.
The TUC, in its reply to the European Commission white paper on employment,
growth and competitiveness, also stresses that the free-market policies
adopted by Britain and the US in the 1980s have failed to produce lasting
competitiveness.
The TUC says that both the EC through the Social Chapter and the Clinton
administration in the US have rejected the 'diabolical trade-off' between a
good record on job creation and a good record on employment standards.
Mr David Lea, TUC assistant general secretary, said: 'Our analysis shows
that American and British performance on growth and competitiveness was
relatively poor during the 1980s and early 1990s. It shows that the recipe
of freeing markets, privatisation and cutting employment rights has failed.'

FT  12 AUG 93 / Jobless total set to slide further
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT is today expected to announce the sixth consecutive monthly
fall in unemployment, with City analysts predicting a fall of about 5,000,
David Goodhart writes. This would take the decline since February close to
90,000, with total unemployment at just over 2.9m.
Government economists are increasingly optimistic that the economy is now
generating a net increase in employment. In the first quarter of this year,
which included two months of falling unemployment, the number of people in
employment fell by 61,000.
Unemployment was therefore falling in the first quarter of the year not
because of a net increase in job creation but because fewer people were
coming on to the job market, as a result of factors such as more people
staying on in full-time education. More recent figures for manufacturing
employment show that it fell by 15,000 between April and May.
The second-quarter employment figure for the whole economy will not be known
until next month, but one government economist said yesterday it would be
'disappointing' if it did not show a reasonable increase in view of
stronger-than-expected output.

FT  12 AUG 93 / Commercial vehicle sales fall by 10.8%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEW COMMERCIAL vehicle registrations fell by 10.8 per cent last month to
7,038 as the industry remains stubbornly in recession. Sales have been lower
year-on-year in six of the past seven months.
The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders said that sales of new
commercial vehicles in the first seven months of the year at 104,255 were
5.6 per cent lower than in the corresponding period a year ago. The
persistent decline had been caused in particular by weak demand for light
commercial vehicles.
July is the low point for commercial vehicles sales as purchases are delayed
until the new registration letter in August, but the disappointing trend of
the first half of the year has been maintained.
Registrations of light vans - up to 1.8 tonnes (gross vehicle weight) -
dropped year-on-year by 34.5 per cent last month. This segment has also been
marked by a sharp fall in sales of UK-built vehicles. Imports of light vans
have jumped 63.3 per cent in the first seven months, increasing their share
of the segment to 35.2 per cent from 19.7 per cent a year ago.
The rise in imports has largely resulted from General Motors' decision to
switch the assembly of its Vauxhall/Opel high-roof light vans from the UK to
Portugal.
Registrations of trucks - above 3.5 tonnes - also fell by 3.4 per cent last
month, a minor setback in a part of the market where sales have appeared to
be slowly lifting out of recession.
The firmest sign of recovery from recession has been shown by the heavy
truck sector - above 15 tonnes - where registrations have risen in the first
seven months by 11.7 per cent year-on-year.
The overdue replacement of vehicles, in particular of long-distance haulage
fleets, is responsible for the increase in sales. The recovery in this
segment has helped the UK fortunes of leading European heavy truckmakers,
particularly Scania and Volvo of Sweden and Iveco of Italy.

FT  12 AUG 93 / Audit Commission announces a review of probity in local
government
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Audit Commission has announced a review of probity in local government.
This arises from fears that its present method of measurement, which adds
all convictions for fraud of more than Pounds 500, might be underestimating
the scale of the problem.
The commission said fraud reported to it by auditors had increased each year
over the past three years, and a number of alleged corruption cases had been
passed to the police for investigation.
Publication of the review of fraud, which may include recommendations for
legislation, is expected in November.

FT  12 AUG 93 / Opt-out school audits attacked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PUBLIC MONEY is at risk in grant-maintained schools because of inadequate
audit arrangements, the Audit Commission says in its annual report today.
The local government spending watchdog's claim was denied by the government.
The Labour party has called for an investigation by the Commons public
accounts committee.
In England and Wales, grant-maintained schools - which opt out of local
authority control - are allowed to appoint their own external auditors. Sir
David Cooksey, chairman of the commission, described this arrangement as
'unprecedented in the public sector'.
Although it is accepted practice for companies to appoint their own
auditors, Sir David said extra 'checks and balances' were necessary in the
public sector, because boards of governors are not answerable to
shareholders.
He said: 'Large sums of money are being given to those who have little
experience of handling public finance. In some cases funds may be misused or
even misappropriated.
'The rights of the public to challenge things which are going wrong and have
auditors to issue public interest reports have been withdrawn.'
He said external auditors should be appointed independently, and audits
should include value for money reports. 'Without a rigorous approach to
value for money and without the availability of national comparative
benchmarks of performance, managers with delegated budgets will be unaware
of their own relative performance.'
In a swift response, Mr Eric Forth, the schools minister, said: 'The audit
arrangements of grant-maintained schools are entirely appropriate and
proper.' He said opted-out schools had annual external audits, while the
Funding Agency for Schools, the government body created by this year's
Education Act, would be able to commission value for money studies from the
Audit Commission.
The National Audit Office, the government spending watchdog, also has to
report to parliament on the economy, efficiency and effectiveness of the
schools, he said.
Mr Forth suggested that the commission was looking to create more work for
itself, and said: 'There appears to be a certain amount of 'vested interest'
here. The Audit Commission is, perhaps, understandably, disappointed that
its bid for a monopoly role in GM schools was rejected by parliament during
consideration of the recent education bill.'
Sir David denied that the commission wanted a monopoly role. He said his
concern was that auditors for schools should be externally appointed.
Mrs Ann Taylor, shadow education secretary, said that the schools should
have been made answerable to statutory audit procedures, and attacked the
new funding agency's powers as 'entirely discretionary'.
She said: 'Whilst there is a grant-maintained sector its expenditure must be
properly audited. It is not good enough for government ministers to have
discretion over the issue.'
The Grant-maintained Schools Centre, which provides central services for
opt-out schools, said the right to appoint auditors allowed schools to shop
around for cheaper audit fees.

FT  12 AUG 93 / Jobless total set to slide further
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT is today expected to announce the sixth consecutive monthly
fall in unemployment, with City analysts predicting a fall of about 5,000.
This would take the decline since February close to 90,000, with total
unemployment at just over 2.9m.
Government economists are increasingly optimistic that the economy is now
generating a net increase in employment. In the first quarter of this year,
which included two months of falling unemployment, the number of people in
employment fell by 61,000.
Unemployment was therefore falling in the first quarter of the year not
because of a net increase in job creation but because fewer people were
coming on to the job market, as a result of factors such as more people
staying on in full-time education. More recent figures for manufacturing
employment show that it fell by 15,000 between April and May.
The second-quarter employment figure for the whole economy will not be known
until next month, but one government economist said yesterday it would be
'disappointing' if it did not show a reasonable increase in view of
stronger-than-expected output.
Officials and the government are increasingly confident that the
unemployment trend will continue downwards. While there is still no clear
view about why unemployment has fallen so much earlier than most people
expected, the shake-out of more than 400,000 jobs in the last quarter of
1992 is put forward as the main explanation.
The Trades Union Congress is calling for a 'reassessment' of the convergence
criteria for European economic and monetary union, and for the inclusion of
targets on economic growth and unemployment.
The TUC, in its reply to the European Commission white paper on employment,
growth and competitiveness, also stresses that the free-market policies
adopted by Britain and the US in the 1980s have failed to produce lasting
competitiveness.
The TUC says in its submission, published yesterday, that both the EC
through the Social Chapter and the Clinton administration in the US have
rejected the 'diabolical trade-off' between a good record on job creation
and a good record on employment standards.
Mr David Lea, TUC assistant general secretary, said: 'Our analysis shows
that American and British performance on growth and competitiveness was
relatively poor during the 1980s and early 1990s. It shows that the recipe
of freeing markets, privatisation and cutting employment rights has failed.'
It stresses that it is vital for the EC not to move towards a British or US
model of labour market deregulation. Although the US has had a better record
on private-sector job creation than the EC, unit-labour costs in Europe have
fallen faster than in the US between 1980 and 1993.

FT  12 AUG 93 / BCCI lawsuit wins backing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TOUCHE Ross, the liquidator of Bank of Credit and Commerce International,
has received what it considers a powerful mandate to pursue its legal action
against the Bank of England.
More than 5,000 depositors have signed and returned agreements to assign
claims worth Pounds 400m in all to the liquidators. This is substantially
more than was thought necessary to justify pursuit of the action, according
to a letter sent out by the liquidators.
The Bank of England has been granted an extension until September 1 to serve
its defence of the action. Originally the defence should have been made by
July 5 but the Bank asked for more time.
Depositors have been told that a civil court decision in Luxembourg, which
is needed before payments can be made from the proposed compensation
agreement, will not be made until October 27.
Touche Ross has been frustrated by the time taken by the Luxembourg court to
consider the agreement. The court has found only two and a half day's court
time since May for legal arguments.
The compensation package worked out between the liquidators and BCCI's Abu
Dhabi majority shareholders has been consistently opposed by a number of
creditors. However, a large majority of those who replied when canvassed
voted to accept the deal in which Abu Dhabi would contribute a minimum of
Dollars 1.7bn. The referendum had been demanded by the Luxembourg court.
The delays meant that staged payments of Dollars 800m in December 1992 and
Dollars 500m in June this year, promised by Abu Dhabi into the pooling
agreement, did not go ahead because they were conditional on the approval of
the agreement in the UK, Luxembourg and the Cayman Islands. The package has
already been approved in British and Cayman courts.
Liquidators have three principal civil suits outstanding. One is against The
Bank of England; another is against the National Commercial Bank of Saudi
Arabia and Sheikh Khalid Bin Mahfouz, its former chief operating officer,
who is also a former shareholder of BCCI; the third is against the former
BCCI auditors, Price Waterhouse and Ernst and Whinney (now Ernst and Young).
Ernst and Whinney audited part of the bank until 1987.
The action against the Bank of England is unprecedented and may rest on the
liquidators' ability to prove that the Bank was negligent in not acting
earlier against BCCI when it told of problems in 1985.

FT  12 AUG 93 / BSkyB predicts surge in satellite dish sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Sky Broadcasting, the satellite television company, is privately
claiming a significant boost in satellite dish sales in advance of the
launch of its new subscription channel package at the start of next month.
Internal estimates say satellite dish sales have been running at more than
15,000 a week since the start of July.
If confirmed, this would be the first evidence that new subscribers, at
least, are not being put off by the move to subscriptions on virtually all
channels.
A total of 14 channels, some of them new from the US, will be included in
the subscription package. But this is a fundamental shift in the nature of
satellite television and its economics. It will also mean that viewers will
have to pay for channels that are at present free to those with satellite
dishes.
The package is being launched with a number of special deals - Pounds 3.99 a
month for those subscribing before the end of December, Pounds 6.99 a month
thereafter. A combined basic package plus sport will cost Pounds 11.99
although the new subscription channels will be available at no extra charge
to those already paying for a movie channel.
The cost of the entire BSkyB package will be Pounds 19.99 a month. Staff at
BSkyB, a consortium in which Pearson, owner of the Financial Times holds a
significant stake, are happy with the initial response.
What is less clear is how those who already have satellite television, but
do not pay for a movie channel, will react to the new charges. A significant
loss of viewers who do not want to pay could occur.
BSkyB figures for dish sales last month run counter to official figures from
Barb, the body which produces official viewing figures. Barb believes there
were 2.477m satellite dishes in the UK on July 1 and by August 1 this had
risen to 2.501m.
GfK, the marketing research group, says that by June 26 total dish
ownership, excluding Northern Ireland, stood at 2.228m - an increase of
27,000 on the previous month.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INDONESIAN economic and trade ministers met yesterday to discuss threats to
trading privileges with the US following criticism of Jakarta's treatment of
workers, Reuter reports from Jakarta.
'This is an old issue in bilateral trade with the US. We faced this issue in
the previous cabinet and so far we have been able to settle it well,' Mr
Saleh Ariff, co-ordinating minister for economics, told reporters before the
meeting.
'However, it (the criticism) is indeed getting sharper.'
Washington has threatened to cut imports at preferential tax rates under the
Generalised System of Preferences if Indonesia does not improve labour
practices.
Fourteen per cent of Indonesian exports to the US, worth Dollars 600m
(Pounds 402.6m), qualified for tax concessions last year.
Mr Tungky Ariwibowo, the industry minister quoted by the official Antara
news agency, said on Tuesday that Indonesia would strive to maintain the
system. 'We should solve the GSP facility problems as soon as possible.'
Washington criticised Indonesia for barring the country's largest
independent trade union, the Indonesia Welfare Labour Union, from holding
its first congress late last month.
Indonesia has also come under increased US criticism on human rights. The US
State Department cited human rights concerns last week when it blocked the
sale to Indonesia of four ageing American-built F-5E fighter jets from
Jordan.
Indonesian State Secretary Murdiono said on Tuesday the government would
explain its position on human rights to Washington.
'I hope the problem can be solved,' he said.

FT  12 AUG 93 / World Trade News: Venezuelan gas project approved - Plan
involves first foreign equity investment in sector since 1976
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
VENEZUELA'S Congress has given final approval to a Dollars 5.6bn (Pounds
3.75bn) natural gas project that involves the first foreign equity
investment in the country's oil and gas sectors since the oil industry was
nationalised in 1976.
The decision is expected to open the door to other big international
investments in Venezuela's petroleum sector.
The partners in this joint venture, the largest single project ever
undertaken by the Venezuelan oil industry, are Lagoven, a subsidiary of the
national oil company PDVSA, which will have 33 per cent of the equity; Royal
Dutch/Shell (30 per cent); Exxon (29 per cent) and Mitsubishi (8 per cent).
The project calls for producing natural gas from offshore fields in the
Caribbean, transporting it to land by pipeline, and building a large gas
liquefaction plant, port facilities and other infrastructure on the Paria
Peninsula in eastern Venezuela.
The promoters plan to export the final product, liquefied natural gas or
LNG, to meet growing demand for 'clean energy' in markets on the east coast
of the US and in Europe.
Liquefaction capacity is projected at 6m tonnes a year, and the partners
will buy or lease six 50,000 dwt LNG carriers.
Under Venezuela's Oil Industry Nationalisation Law of 1975, joint ventures
in oil and gas between the national oil company and any private investors
can be carried out only when the project represents 'the national interest'
and receives approval by both houses of the Venezuelan legislature.
This week's congressional approval came with the votes of the country's two
largest political parties, Democratic Action and the Christian Democrat
Copei party.
Political parties on the left mounted a last-minute campaign to block the
project, saying it would be contrary to national interests.
The project, called Christopher Columbus to honour the explorer's landing on
the Paria Peninsula in 1498, has been under discussion by the partners for
around four years. It was delayed earlier by questions about future demand
for LNG imports and by concerns over the protection of technology to be
used, applicable tax rates and whether legal disputes would be settled by
Venezuelan or foreign courts. (The latter will have the final word.)
The change in attitude towards foreign investment in Venezuela's oil
industry was forced on many Venezuelan politicians by economic reality.
PDVSA and the Venezuelan government have been seeking foreign capital for
big projects in oil and gas for some time. PDVSA executives and government
officials including Mr Alirio Parra, minister of energy and mines, have
stressed that PDVSA by itself cannot finance some important projects.

TAIWAN'S state-owned Chinese Petroleum Corp (CPC) said it had invited 20
private Taiwanese companies to invest in building a multi-billion dollar
petrochemical complex on the island, Reuter reports from Taipei.
The 20 companies have been briefed on CPC's plans for the complex, which
would include a naphtha cracker with annual production capacity of 900,000
tonnes of ethylene and an oil refinery with a daily capacity of 200,000
barrels.
'We hope the private companies will present plans for their participation
next month so that we can map out the whole project,' a CPC spokesman said.
He said CPC would have a stake of 30-35 per cent in the project, with the
private sector holding the rest.
CPC itself is on the government's list of companies to be privatised, but no
date has been set.
The spokesman said other details of the complex, including the size of
investment and the site, had yet to be decided.
Taiwan's Tuntex group, one of the companies invited to take part in the CPC
project, last month announced plans to build its own Dollars 3.3bn (Pounds
2.21bn) petrochemical complex.

<TEXT>
MERCEDES-BENZ, one of the world's leading luxury carmakers, is planning to
launch a city car in the second half of the 1990s that would be smaller than
a Ford Fiesta or a Rover Metro, writes Kevin Done. Called the Vision A 93,
it will be unveiled at the Frankfurt motor show next month. Mr Jurgen
Hubbert, car division head, said the concept car would 'influence the
development of a future Mercedes-Benz A-class car'.
At only 3.35 metres long, the vehicle is evidence of the upheaval in the
German luxury carmaker's product planning for the 1990s. It also reflects
the intense interest of the world's leading manufacturers in developing new
designs for small cars.
The Mercedes would be a four-seat, five-door model, suitable also for longer
journeys.

FT  12 AUG 93 / World Trade News: Hangzhou on his mind - A Georgia
developer's plan to build a Chinese city
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARBARA HARRISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR John Portman, a renowned Atlanta architect and developer, is credited
with having built the downtown area of his native city nearly single-handed.
But he is now making a significant mark on turf very far from home.
John Portman &amp; Associates, his international architectural and engineering
company, has won the design and master plan contract for a Dollars 1.3bn
(Pounds 870m) project to create a city in China.
The massive project will cover 356 acres on the southern banks of the
Qiantang River, near the eastern coastal city of Hangzhou.
The developer is a consortium called Hangzhou Qiantang River City, whose
leading partner is Mr Ho Iat Seng of Hotin Industries, a manufacturing and
property developer based in Macao. It also includes industrialists,
academics and businessmen from Hong Kong and Macao.
The new city, which will take seven to 10 years to complete, will
accommodate 34,000 people and include villas, high-rise residential
apartment buildings, office buildings, shopping malls, hotels, international
schools, clinics, hospitals and government offices. Mr Portman claims it is
the largest investment ever undertaken by foreign interests in Hangzhou.
It took 'patience and perseverance', says Ms Danielle Martin, spokeswoman
for Portman.
Those qualities will be much in demand again for Portman and other companies
working on Chinese projects if the dour real estate market projections of
KPMG Peat Marwick hold true.
According to Mr Winston Elton, a partner at KPMG Peat Marwick who
specialises in the Chinese market, China's real estate market is in a
nosedive. Mr Elton says the overheated market 'has cooled off and will do so
considerably more'.
The frenetic rush to build over the last decade has recently been brought to
an abrupt halt with the decision last month by the central government to
shut off credit to provincial governments. Mr Elton, who recently returned
from six weeks in China, said, 'Real estate deals have been hung out to
dry.'
Some projects, particularly those near Shanghai, are still likely to go
forward, in part because of substantial investment already made by the
government. Projects in the interior are likely to be put on hold.
On the brighter side, Mr Elton believes the downturn will be temporary
because the long-term demand is there. Nonetheless, he says the market has
tremendous risk, not least because of political uncertainty. 'You're kind of
rolling the dice,' he said.
This is the fourth big contract for Portman in China.
The best-known of its predecessors was the first, the Dollars 200m
residential and commercial Shanghai Centre, completed in 1990. The company
also designed the Dollars 100m, 565-unit resort community of Dream Lake
Villas in Hangzhou. And it provided the master plan for a less plush
residential and vacation resort called Taihu Garden at Wuli Lake in Wuxi,
which will include 560 villas, a conference centre and multi-storey
apartments.
The prominent Shanghai Centre is home to many foreign businesses, with a
waiting list for its commercial and residential space. Portman also plays a
management role in the project's Shangri-La Hotel.
The Atlanta company began concentrating on the Far East in the 1980s. It has
designed projects in Hong Kong, where it has had offices since 1980, Kuala
Lumpur, Japan, Singapore and Indonesia.
Thanks largely to Mr Portman's son Jack, who began travelling to China in
the late 1970s, Portman &amp; Associates is reaping the fruit of having doggedly
built relationships with the Chinese.
The younger Mr Portman's success can be measured in part by the fact that
when Chinese leader Mr Deng Xiaoping visited the US in 1979 to seek closer
ties, one of his stops was the Portman firm in Atlanta.
'The key to business in China is guanxi, or relationships,' says Mr Elton.
'You need internal political clout.' Not least, he adds, to ensure that you
are paid.
Another requirement is a commitment to the long term. When China was just
beginning to open in the late 1970s and early 1980s, Portman officials
believed the country, and particularly Shanghai, would develop quickly.
But, says Mr A J Robinson, president of Portman Overseas, a Portman
affiliate, the boom came much later than the company had initially thought.
'We knew if we could just hold on long enough, it would happen,' he says.
And the quality of Portman's guanxi can expect to be tested for the new
Hangzhou city.

FT  12 AUG 93 / World Trade News: European new car sales fall faster
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEW CAR sales in western Europe dropped by an estimated 20.1 per cent last
month, intensifying the already steep decline experienced in the first half.
The July figure showed a fall to around 914,000 from 1.14m in the same month
a year earlier. It was the seventh month in succession that sales have
dropped.
In the first seven months of the year new car sales have gone down by an
estimated 17.7 per cent to 7m from 8.5m in the corresponding a period a year
ago, according to provisional industry estimates.
The decline has been led by a serious contraction in sales in Germany and
Italy, the two largest car markets in Europe. The rate of decline
accelerated in both markets in July, as German new car sales fell by an
estimated 24.5 per cent and sales in Italy dropped by around 31 per cent.
Overall sales last month were lower than they were a year ago in 14 of 17
markets across Europe, with modest rises only in Switzerland, Norway and the
UK, where sales in July rose by 7 per cent.
Western Europe is suffering its steepest fall in demand for new cars for
more than a decade, with sales in the first seven months dramatically lower
than a year ago in 16 of 17 markets.
The only significant gain has come in Britain where there has been a rise of
9.1 per cent, albeit from a very low level. In Germany, Europe's biggest
single market, sales fell by an estimated 20.7 per cent in the first seven
months to 2.01m.
Among the big six volume carmakers, the Fiat group of Italy, which includes
Alfa Romeo and Lancia, has suffered the steepest decline, with a fall of
around 25.5 per cent in its sales in the first seven months. Rover, the
British Aerospace subsidiary, is the only significant carmaker in Europe to

FT  12 AUG 93 / World Trade News: Indonesians discuss US trade privilege
threats
</HEADLINE>

   JAKARTA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INDONESIAN economic and trade ministers met yesterday to discuss threats to
trading privileges with the US following criticism of Jakarta's treatment of
workers, Reuter reports from Jakarta.
'This is an old issue in bilateral trade with the US. We faced this issue in
the previous cabinet and so far we have been able to settle it well,' Mr
Saleh Ariff, co-ordinating minister for economics, told reporters before the
meeting.
'However, it (the criticism) is indeed getting sharper.'
Washington has threatened to cut imports at preferential tax rates under the
Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) if Indonesia does not improve labour
practices.
The GSP was a concept developed within the Geneva-based UN Conference on
Trade and Development - whereby temporary and non-reciprocal grants of
preferences were awarded by developing countries to non-developed countries
 -to encourage the expansion of manufactured and semi-manufactured goods
from developing countries by making goods more competitive through tariff
preferences.
The US has given Indonesia until February to improve labour rights,
including the right to organise freely.
Fourteen per cent of Indonesian exports to the US, worth Dollars 600m
(Pounds 402.6m), qualified for tax concessions last year.
Mr Tungky Ariwibowo, the industry minister quoted by the official Antara
news agency, said on Tuesday that Indonesia would strive to maintain the
system. 'We should solve the GSP facility problems as soon as possible.'
Washington criticised Indonesia for barring the country's largest
independent trade union, the Indonesia Welfare Labour Union (SBSI), from
holding its first congress late last month.
An Indonesian official said the government did not recognise the SBSI as a
trade union because it did not represent workers and sought to divide the
labour movement.
Indonesia has also come under increased US criticism on human rights. The US
State Department cited human rights concerns last week when it blocked the
sale to Indonesia of four ageing American-built F-5E fighter jets from
Jordan.
Indonesian State Secretary Murdiono said on Tuesday the government would
explain its position on human rights to Washington. 'I hope the problem can
be solved,' he said.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MALAYSIA'S cabinet yesterday approved plans for a second national airline
which will fly international routes, Transport Minister Ling Liong Sik said,
Reuter reports from Kuala Lumpur.
A privately owned domestic airline, Pelangi Air, will be restructured with a
fresh injection of capital - mostly from state companies - to set up the new
airline, Mr Ling was quoted as saying by the official Bernama news agency.
Malaysian Airlines System (MAS), the state-owned national airline, will be
part of the consortium that will capitalise and operate the new airline, he
said.
State-owned Hicom, a holding company for several big state manufacturing
concerns, will be the biggest investor, with a 40 per cent stake in the
airline. Mr Ling did not give details about the equity shares for the other
partners in the consortium.
Government officials have said previously that the new airline would mostly
fly international routes, but would not compete directly with MAS.
The Commonwealth Development Corporation, the UK's development finance
institution, has obtained a loan of about Ecu200,000 (Pounds 151,500) from
the EC as partial funding to enable John Laing International to carry out a
feasibility study for the expansion of Noi Bai international airport, near
Hanoi, Vietnam. The study is to cover the funding, design, construction and
operation of a new terminal with an annual capacity of 5m passengers.

<TEXT>
TAIWAN has signed an agreement to start direct air links with France next
month, the Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) said yesterday, Reuter
reports from Taipei.
Flights between Taipei and Paris will start in September, and weekly flights
will increase to three next year from two this year, Mr Charles Lin, CAA's
aviation division chief, said.
Taiwan's flag carrier, China Airlines, and Air France will not use aircraft
carrying national flags of the two countries to fly the route, to avoid
wounding political sensitivities.
Air Charter, a subsidiary of Air France, will begin cargo flights between
Paris and Taipei in September and passenger flights in November. Taiwan has
not yet decided when and which airline will fly the route.
Taiwan has difficulty establishing air links with foreign countries because
of political pressure from its rival China.
China, which has claimed sovereignty over the island since the end of the
Chinese civil war in 1949, has sought to prevent other countries from
expanding links with the island.
However, Taiwan's economic influence and growing overseas travel have won
the island direct air links with several countries in recent years. It
currently has direct links with six European countries, including Austria,
Britain, Bulgaria, Germany, Luxembourg and the Netherlands. It also plans to
begin flights to Russia this year.

FT  12 AUG 93 / Tension high as Nigeria braces for protests: Stay-aways and
demonstrations have been called across the country
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ADAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SENSE of foreboding is almost palpable as Nigeria prepares for three
days of protest which could as easily tilt the country towards instability
as thrust it towards democracy.
Armed soldiers were posted at main intersections in Lagos yesterday. Shops
and offices closed early. Every bus heading out of Lagos was laden as
thousands of workers sent families and belongings to the safety of their
home towns and villages before the campaign gets underway today.
Infuriated by President Ibrahim Babangida's annulment of the June 12
presidential poll, the Campaign for Democracy - an informal coalition led by
civil rights activists, has called for a protest without precedent in the
country's post independence history.
Stay-aways, rallies and acts of civil disobedience have been called across
the country, to press home demands that General Babangida fulfil his pledge
to hand over to an elected civilian government on August 27.
Campaign organisers said yesterday the protests would go ahead despite the
government's threat to impose a state of emergency. 'The protests are still
on,' said Mr Livinus Ede, a CD official. 'The government statement has
nothing to do with it.'
But the days ahead could demonstrate the vulnerability of the opposition
rather than undermine the position of a seemingly intransigent general,
either wedded to power or fearful of the consequences of surrendering it.
The protests so far have been loud, but discordant. The two permitted
opposition parties are weak, the poorly organised trade union movement faces
high unemployment, the civil rights campaigners have few resources. The
ex-generals who have joined in the call for Gen Babangida to step down, fear
the bloody consequences of confrontation.
For all those contemplating action, the memory of the the civil war over
Biafra in the 1960s may mute the protest. The carnage and starvation that
cost hundreds of thousands of lives may be history, but the spectre of
secession is real even to the post-war generation.
Whether Yoruba people from the south, Ibo from the east, Hausa-Fulani from
the north, or a member of a minority tribe required by realpolitik to take
sides, the fragility of the Nigerian federation remains an abiding concern.
All the main opposition players - leaders of the Social Democratic party,
the National Republican Convention, and retired General Olusegun Obasanjo,
head of state from 1976 to 1979 and chairman of the Association for
Democracy - are aware of this fragility.
The ethnic and religious fault line which could split Nigeria is blurred, as
the presidential poll showed. Chief Moshood Abiola, the SDP's victorious
presidential candidate, is Yoruba, but a Moslem, and has his stronghold in
the south but won substantial support in the north.
Nevertheless, in times of stress the fault line runs between the largely
Christian south and the predominantly Moslem north, with both sides aware
that the vital asset is the oil in the east, responsible for over 90 per
cent of Nigeria's export earnings.
It is partly with these concerns in mind that the two main opposition
parties are holding back from the latest campaign. A similar call for
protests last month ended in violence in which up to 100 people died.
At the same, the opposition parties are intrinsically weak. Both were
created by the government. Neither has a distinct ideology, nor can they
generate mass appeal.
In the meantime, the SDP's leader is out of the country. Mr Abiola is in the
US rallying support for his presidency, and while he is away there is little
focus for resistance.
The deciding factor in the critical days ahead may be the role of the
unions. But they seem reluctant to act now, preferring instead to wait and
see what happens on August 27. The Nigeria Labour Congress has indicated
that it is prepared to call a national strike if there is no handover, a
threat backed up yesterday by Nigeria's biggest oil workers' union.
The organisers of this week's campaign, however, believe that pressure must
be exerted now if Gen Babangida is to fulfil his promise.
The exasperation of many Nigerians with these and other divisions and
uncertainties in the opposition ranks has brought respected non-partisan
national figures into the fray.
Most notable is Mr Obasanjo, who became the only Nigerian president to give
up power voluntarily when he ended 15 years of military rule in 1979. The
former general has done more than anyone in Nigeria to make clear to Mr
Babangida that his time in office has run out.
Having campaigned vigorously to persuade northern traditional rulers that
the issue transcends old rivalries, Mr Obasanjo seems to be throwing his
weight behind the civilian protest.
Near his farm in Otta near Lagos Mr Obasanjo holds meetings with a small
group of other former heads of state, generals and well known critics of the
regime.
In a speech last Monday, he stressed: 'The current political crisis is not
an ethnic or religious issue.
'As long as the military are at the helm,' he went on, 'democracy and good
governance elude us.'

FT  12 AUG 93 / Afghan border focus of region's woes: The hostilities
bubbling across central Asia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FARHAN BOKHARI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STINGER anti-aircraft missiles were among the deadliest weapons in the
arsenal of the Afghan tribesmen who fought Soviet troops. Now the US Central
Intelligence Agency, which supplied hundreds of the shoulder-fired missiles
to the Afghan resistance, wants them back.
Fears of spreading conflict on Afghanistan's border, while central control
in Kabul, the capital, remains tenuous, are likely to have added urgency to
the CIA's quest to retrieve sophisticated weapons in what a senior Pakistani
official calls 'a very tense situation.'
The region's troubles, with settlement of Afghanistan's long civil war still
fragile, have been worsened by hostilities bubbling on the border between
Afghanistan and the central Asian republic of Tajikistan.
As the border war has escalated, Moscow has responded to growing
cross-border attacks by Afghanistan-based Tajik rebels - who fled Tajikistan
after losing a civil war last year - by sending additional troops to defend
the beleaguered government in Dushanbe, the Tajik capital.
Russia, which has an agreement with the Tajik government to defend the
Afghan border, justifies its presence on the grounds that it must stem a
fundamentalist Moslem threat and defend the interests of the 200,000-strong
Russian minority in Tajikistan.
But conscious of the domestic political dangers of again becoming embroiled
militarily in Afghanistan after Moscow's severe losses in the 1980s, Mr
Andrei Kozyrev, Russia's foreign minister, has said: 'Russia will not
compensate for a lack of political will towards reconciliation in Tajikistan
with the blood of its own soldiers, as happened before in Afghanistan.'
Mr Hidayat Amin Arsala, the Afghan foreign minister, has been in Dushanbe
this week for talks with the Tajik government, leading to suggestions last
night that Kabul try to mediate in the border war.
Both sides are under pressure from Moscow and other governments in the
region, notably Pakistan and Iran, to negotiate a settlement and prevent
another war involving Afghanistan.
Western diplomats voice fears over the role of Islamic militants in
destabilising the newly independent central Asian republics, as well as in
intensifying their activities against other governments in the area.
According to a foreign diplomat in Dushanbe quoted by Reuters: 'What the
fundamentalists in northern Afghanistan want is not just to bring the Tajik
opposition back to power but to move into other countries of Central Asia,
destabilise those areas, replace those governments with Islamic governments
and move into Russia itself.'
Of their allies in Afghanistan, another diplomat in Dushanbe said: 'These
people all fought the communist (Afghan) government and that united them. In
Tajikistan, they see a revival of communism on the ruins of the former
Soviet Union. This is why it's easy for them to project the idea that
communists are fighting Islam here.'
Mr Sotorios Mousouris, the UN secretary general's personal envoy for
Afghanistan, says: 'I hope we don't see any replay of the conflict between
Afghanistan and Russia. I don't think this region needs another conflict.
Afghanistan has enough problems on its own.'
Western diplomats are concerned that the new conflict has come as
Afghanistan remains without a clear political settlement and an effective
government in Kabul, its capital. As a result, there is no central authority
which could use force to restrain the Tajik fighters.
Although in recent weeks there has been a lull in large-scale fighting
around Kabul, with occasional clashes and small scale casualties, prospects
for a lasting settlement remain bleak.
'There is respite at this moment. Kabul is relatively calm,' says Mr
Mousouris, adding that 'the various forces which control Kabul are in the
same position that they had before, both militarily and politically'.
However, Afghanistan's two leading rivals, Mr Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, the prime
minister, and Mr Ahmed Shah Masood, the former defence minister, remain in
control of large numbers of war-hardened mujahideen followers who are well
armed.
In addition, the powerful Uzbek general, Rashid Dostum, remains in control
of a large number of militiamen who can be instantly deployed in battle.
Although the Afghan government of President Burhanuddin Rabbani apparently
wants to negotiate an end to the border fighting, its ability to restrain
dissident groups is limited.
Efforts towards reconstruction to facilitate a return of Afghan refugees and
normal working of the government have also had little success. Food supplies
remain inadequate due to road blocks erected by different area commanders,
who prevent convoys from reaching the capital. International donors have
given only Dollars 40m (Pounds 26.8m) to rehabilitation efforts in response
to a UN request for Dollars 138m.
Diplomats are worried that in the absence of a clear political settlement in
Kabul, the shortage of funds for relief and reconstruction has made it even
more difficult to hope for peace.
Meanwhile, demand resulting from the continuing troubles has pushed up black
market prices for Stinger missiles to Dollars 100,000, and the CIA does not
have enough money to buy them. According to the Los Angeles Times, it has
had to ask the Clinton administration for an extra Dollars 55m for operation
MIAS (Missing In Action Stingers). The Bush administration had given it
Dollars 10m.

CHINA'S Communist party has issued new regulations aimed at stamping out
corruption in the country's two infant stock exchanges. The move follows a
drive against corruption within the party's own ranks.
The regulations lay down that the two bodies charged with overseeing the
stock exchanges, the State Council Securities Policy Committee and the China
Securities Regulatory Commission, must comply with 23 rules.
Mr Zhu Lin, secretary general of the CSRC, has been quoted by the official
press as saying the new rules will 'place securities officials under the
supervision of the public and prevent insider trading'. The 89 employees of
the two organisations face the sack if they are caught taking bribes, while
companies that try to bribe them risk having their licences suspended and
any new stock issues cancelled.
The stock exchange in Shanghai opened in 1990 while the exchange in
Shenzhen, which borders Hong Kong, started operating the following year.
Although there are about 100 listed companies, observers believe that more
than 3,000 companies are trading stock.
The lack of a securities law was highlighted last August when trading on the
Shenzhen exchange was suspended temporarily after hundreds of people rioted
over the corrupt allocation of new shares.

THE Angolan government said yesterday it had repelled Unita rebels from
central parts of the city of Cuito, where hundreds of people have been
killed in recent heavy fighting, Reuter reports from Sao Tome.
State radio, monitored in the island state of Sao Tome and Principe, said it
had pushed the rebels back to the outskirts, from where they continued to
shell the central highlands city.
The radio denied reports that Unita had gained the advantage in Cuito. Unita
had controlled some streets but the situation had now been reversed, it
added.
Unita said on Tuesday it had seized part of Cuito, where the government says
rebel shelling has killed more than 200 civilians in the past few days.
Hospital sources quoted by Angolan state radio said more than 20 civilians
were killed in the rebel shelling of the city on Tuesday.

FT  12 AUG 93 / Cambodians turn back returning Vietnamese: Khmer Rouge
threatens to step up attacks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THOUSANDS of ethnic Vietnamese fishermen and their families who fled
Cambodia after a wave of killings by Khmer Rouge guerrillas are being
prevented from returning to the country by the new interim Cambodian
government in Phnom Penh.
The government says it cannot protect them from the threat of violence, but
United Nations officials working in Phnom Penh believe that is largely an
attempt to excuse their hostility towards the ethnic Vietnamese.
Most of the people who are now trying to re-enter Cambodia fled the country
with what they could cram into their boats after more than 100 ethnic
Vietnamese people were killed in April in a series of Khmer Rouge attacks on
their floating villages.
At a meeting on Tuesday, the head of the United Nations Transitional
Authority in Cambodia (Untac), Mr Yasushi Akashi, pressed the two interim
prime ministers to allow the people back into Cambodia. However, Untac
officials say they do not believe his appeal will produce any immediate
change in the government's attitude.
Untac officials say the ethnic Vietnamese must be given the freedom to
choose where they want to live. The people at the border were mostly born in
Cambodia and have lived most of their lives in the country.
There is still a serious threat to ethnic Vietnamese people who return to
Cambodia. On Tuesday night, six were killed in an attack on their house in
the central province of Kompong Chnang. Local officials say there is
evidence that these killings were the work of Khmer Rouge guerrillas.
In recent weeks Khmer Rouge radio has been broadcasting increasingly
bloodthirsty calls to Cambodians to rise up and kill ethnic Vietnamese
people if they come back to Cambodia. A broadcast on Khmer Rouge radio last
week warned that Cambodians were 'sharpening their knives' in preparation
for what it called 'a new Vietnamese invasion'.
The Khmer Rouge reign of terror in Cambodia was overthrown when Vietnamese
troops invaded the country in December 1978.
Untac officials at the border say the people there are well aware of the
danger they face if they return to their homes in central Cambodia. They
still want to go back, though, because they have run out of food and money
and they have no means of earning a living away from the great central lake,
the Tonle Sap, where they live and fish.
Most of them have fled twice from Cambodia: the first time when the Khmer
Rouge came to power in 1975 and the second in April this year, when Khmer
Rouge guerrillas made a concerted attempt to force them out and the United
Nations was unable to protect them unless they chose to leave.

FT  12 AUG 93 / Aid sought as locusts spread
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AT LEAST Dollars 6m (Pounds 4m) is needed urgently in donor aid to prevent a
new plague of desert locusts which could spread across Africa, the Middle
East and south-west Asia, the United Nations Food and Agriculture
Organisation (FAO) said yesterday.
Rain in the Sahel countries and monsoons in Asia were encouraging rapid
breeding by the locusts, which now constituted 'a major threat to food crops
and food security', said Mr Edouard Saouma, FAO director-general.
Swarms had been reported throughout east Africa and the Sahel, said the
Rome-based FAO. Last month they also spread from Yemen towards Oman in the
Gulf and eastwards to Pakistan and India.
Mr Saouma said the international community had responded generously but more
aid was needed.
'This is the greatest threat since the last plague of 1988,' when millions
of dollars of damage was done to African crops, said Mr Keith Cressman, FAO
locust reporting and forecasting officer.

FT  12 AUG 93 / PLO seeks revised strategy for peace process
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TUNIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PALESTINIAN leaders holding crisis talks in Tunis focused debate yesterday
on how best to co-ordinate positions on peace negotiations with Israel and
ensure a democratic debate.
The broad debate on Palestinian strategy, which also reflected desire for a
revision in the framework of the Middle East peace process, came as Mr
Yassir Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organisation,
acknowledged for the first time that three Palestinian negotiators had
threatened to resign.
Mr Arafat said that after three days of talks within his Fatah faction, the
PLO executive committee would now decide whether to accept the resignations
offered by Mrs Hanan Ashrawi, Mr Faisal Husseini and Mr Saeb Erekat. The
three negotiators are upset about a lack of consultation by Mr Arafat.
As a concession to the three moderates, Palestinians are considering setting
up a joint 'administration' linking PLO leaders with negotiators from the
Israeli-occupied territories which would decide on a unified negotiating
position. Such a move, if approved, would lessen Mr Arafat's grip on
strategy, improve communication and strengthen the influence of negotiators
from inside the occupied territories.
A senior PLO official, however, said that the issue at the heart of the
crisis was the framework for peace talks agreed in Madrid by all the parties
in October 1991. He said it was recognised that after 21 months of fruitless
talks the process contained two 'funda-mental flaws' - no direct talks
between Israel and the PLO and a two-phased agreement which leaves
resolution of the most sensitive issues, such as control over
Israeli-occupied Arab east Jerusalem, until after an interim agreement on
self-rule has been signed.
'The restrictions imposed by the Madrid framework has caused this latest
tension and confusion because it makes divisions between the PLO and the
negotiating team,' said the official. 'The framework no longer works and it
must be changed if we are going to make quick progress on peace.' He also
said Palestinians concurred that direct talks between Israel and the PLO,
besides unifying leaders from inside and outside the territories, would help
to accelerate peace talks.
There is less consensus on the need to abandon talks on the interim phase of
Palestinian self-rule and move directly on to talks about the 'final status'
of a Palestinian entity. Both the US and Israel oppose any change in the
Madrid framework until the possibilities of an interim agreement without
direct talks with the PLO have been exhausted.

FT  12 AUG 93 / Buthelezi calls for East Rand peace with ANC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CHIEF Mangosuthu Buthelezi, leader of the Inkatha Freedom party, yesterday
called on his supporters in the East Rand townships, where more than 400
people have died in political conflict over the past five weeks, to make
peace with rivals in the African National Congress.
Chief Buthelezi was addressing about 3,000 supporters at a rally in Thokoza,
the township at the heart of much of the recent violence, which has seen
Inkatha supporters pitted against the ANC. Echoing a similar call made by
ANC leader Mr Nelson Mandela when he visited the area last week, Chief
Buthelezi said: 'I say to IFP members and . . . supporters that they must
find common cause with ANC members and. . . supporters.'
Chief Buthelezi made no mention of when Inkatha might return to
constitutional talks which it walked out of on July 2. The Inkatha central
committee is expected to make a decision on Saturday.
Like Mr Mandela, Chief Buthelezi yesterday accepted that political leaders
themselves had to do more to stop the violence. He said it was not good
enough 'for us as black leaders when we fail to stop the violence and turn
around to blame it only on the ineffectiveness of the security forces'.
He stressed, though, that violence would not stop without the efforts of the
people on the ground. 'When that will does not exist, no peace-keeping force
and no dispute resolution committees will ever be able to function
properly.'
Although his tone was more emollient than recently, this did not stop Chief
Buthelezi repeating his call for the disbandment of Umkhonto we Sizwe (MK),
the armed wing of the ANC. He said the absorption of MK into the Defence
Force, or into the recently mooted multi-party peace-keeping force was a
'total prescription for disaster'.

ways of keeping people out of harm's way. He warned that many earthwork
levees along the river were only designed to contain much lesser degrees of
flooding.
President Bill Clinton will sign a Dollars 6.3bn flood relief bill today in

<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton has picked General John Shalikashvili, Nato's supreme
commander in Europe, to succeed General Colin Powell as chairman of the US
Joint Chiefs of Staff, George Graham reports.
Gen Shalikashvili's appointment is subject to confirmation by the Senate,
but is expected to take effect when Gen Powell completes his second two-year
term next month.
The chairman is the top US military officer, and Gen Shalikashvili's role
will be particularly important because of Mr Clinton's less than smooth
relationship with the armed forces. Gen Powell opposed sharper cuts in the
defence budget and resisted Mr Clinton's efforts to let homosexuals serve
openly.
Gen Shalikashvili, a 57-year-old artillery officer, was born in Poland and
came to the US at the age of 16. He served as commander of the allied
operation to protect the Kurds in northern Iraq, and as assistant to Gen
Powell.
Mr Clinton said yesterday Gen Shalikashvili had been a leader in persuading
Nato to undertake new missions outside its traditional boundaries, including
the recent decision to prepare for possible air strikes in Bosnia.

FT  12 AUG 93 / Brazil under pressure to curb mounting inflation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINA LAMB
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   RIO DE JANEIRO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE inexorable rise in Brazil's monthly inflation, expected to top 33 per
cent this month, has led to growing demands for drastic action to tackle the
problem, even a new 'shock plan' of economic measures.
Prices of food have been rising particularly quickly and, in an apparent
sign of desperation, the government yesterday reinstated Sunab, the prices
watchdog body previously associated with enforcing price freezes.
The government has promised the International Monetary Fund that it will
reduce monthly inflation to 25 per cent by December, but companies have
revised predictions upwards for this year to 1,900 per cent, Brazil's
highest ever.
Although Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, Brazil's new finance minister, keeps
smiling, the problems are proving far more intractable than expected. Last
week, for the first time, he admitted he would need to take further measures
against inflation beyond the promised clean-up of public finances.
The financial markets reacted so violently that Mr Cardoso was forced to go
on television to quash rumours of his impending departure. This Saturday he
will address the nation, apparently to reaffirm that no shock plan is being
prepared.
Nonetheless, the clamour for shock measures, such as a price freeze, is
growing. Mr Tasso Jereissatti, president of the Social Democratic party,
accused the politicians, businessmen and workers making such calls of 'a
lack of solidarity' with the government's long-term strategy of fiscal
adjustment. 'In the 12 weeks since Mr Cardoso took office we have gone from
people being scared of a shock to people demanding it,' he said.
Mr Cardoso's stated priority of balancing government accounts is in trouble.
Despite making Dollars 6bn (Pounds 4bn) in cuts, the government's most
optimistic figures for next year's budget put the operational deficit at a
record Dollars 31.5bn. A new cheque tax, which was supposed to bring in
Dollars 600m a month, is being contested in court, state governments are
proving reluctant to repay their debts to the centre, and the cost of the
federal payroll has jumped from Dollars 14bn to Dollars 18bn.
The privatisation programme has almost come to a halt and President Itamar
Franco now says he will not allow the sales of big companies such as Vale do
Rio Doce and Petrobras.
To Mr Cardoso's dismay, congress approved a new wage policy requiring
monthly real wage adjustments, though this would be highly inflationary. Mr
Franco vetoed the measure, offering a compromise which would still cost the
government an extra Dollars 2bn this year, but he has yet to obtain
congressional approval for this.
On the positive side, the Central Bank has managed to convert 20 per cent of
domestic debt from 28-day into 130-day securities and tax revenues have
increased Dollars 500m a month, thanks partly to a change in legislation
forcing companies to pay at source tax on financial profits. The motor
industry has just announced its best month ever.
But there seems little other reason for optimism. Spending pressures will
increase enormously as campaigning gets under way for next year's
congressional and presidential elections.
It has not escaped anyone's notice that Mr Domingo Cavallo, the Argentine
finance minister and author of that country's successful anti-inflation
dollarisation plan, will be paying a visit next month.

FT  12 AUG 93 / Presidential election revives Chilean political dynasties: A
look at the prospective candidates' lineage
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID PILLING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER 17 years of military rule and more than three years of transition to
democracy, a certain familiarity has returned to Chilean politics. The old
family names that dominated public life for much of the century have
resurfaced, as the son of one former president and the grandson of another
prepare to do battle in December's presidential election.
Four months before Chileans are due to go to the polls, the result is almost
a foregone conclusion. Barring extraordinary mishap, Mr Eduardo Frei, son of
the much-acclaimed president of 1964-70, will gain the presidency as head of
the ruling Concertacion coalition of centre-left parties. For months,
opinion polls have shown 42-year-old Mr Frei more than 40 percentage points
ahead of his nearest rival.
However, the gap is now likely to close, following the selection on Sunday
of Mr Arturo Alessandri, grandson of one president and nephew of another, as
the compromise candidate of the rightwing electoral pact, the Union for
Chilean Progress. Chileans like 'trademark names', said Mr Alessandri
shortly after gaining the nomination, and now they have two.
The nomination of Mr Alessandri, 69 and considered by many a political
lightweight, was largely a result of the rivalries that have plagued Chile's
right since the handover to democracy. The two main opposition parties,
Renovacion Nacional and the Union of Independent Democrats, could not agree
on a common presidential candidate, allowing Mr Alessandri, an independent,
to emerge as a compromise.
It is a further sign of disarray among the opposition that Mr Jose Pinera,
the architect of many of Chile's successful economic reforms and arguably
the most respected rightwing politician, has deserted the electoral pact and
is running his own presidential campaign. Mr Pinera, whose Ross Perot-type
stance casts him in the role of 'anti-politician', has taken to sniping from
sidelines, calling the pact 'marginal' to the presidential elections.
Mr Frei, on the other hand, came through May primaries with consummate ease.
After a period of friction within the Christian Democrat-dominated
coalition, Mr Frei negotiated a deal with his main rival, the Socialist
leader Mr Ricardo Lagos.
Mr Frei inherits from President Patricio Aylwin, a fellow Christian
Democrat, an economy that grew by 10.2 per cent last year, and the
leadership of a coalition that has successfully stolen the right wing's
thunder. Under Mr Aylwin, the Concertacion left virtually unaltered the
liberal, export-led economic development model established under the regime
of General Augusto Pinochet.
The right, which used to suggest the Concertacion was incapable of applying
the model successfully, has given up that attack after three years of
exceptional economic growth. Its campaign has now moved on to issues of
personal liberty, law and order and government bureaucracy.
Diplomats say Mr Frei's main task was to keep a low profile and shy away
from controversy. He has, they say, become an expert at not saying anything.
He will instead stress continuity of policy and will pledge to deepen
economic reform and extend its fruits to Chile's more than 3m poor.
He has also promised to pay more attention to health and education, which
have been neglected in recent years.
The real interest of December's poll - the first handover from one democracy
to another since 1970 - lies in the congressional elections, according to Mr
Francisco Javier Cuadra, a political analyst and former minister under Gen
Pinochet. The right enjoys a blocking vote in both the 120-member chamber of
deputies and the 47-member senate, which it will be desperately seeking to
maintain.
Much of the right's congressional strength stems from the 1980 constitution
which allowed Gen Pinochet to appoint nine non-elected senators and which
weighted national elections in favour of the opposition through a complex
binominal voting system.
'The Concertacion can only change the constitution if it gets a two-thirds
majority, but it can only win a two-thirds majority by changing the
constitution,' says one observer.
Significant areas of government legislation, such as tax reform, have been
watered down in congress. Likewise, the opposition has stonewalled attempts
to reform Gen Pinochet's 1980 constitution, which, among other things,
prevents the president from sacking military commanders-in-chief.
It is in this context that the opposition's electoral pact and its selection
this week of Mr Alessandri as presidential candidate becomes important. If
the right had shattered and failed to agree common electoral lists, as at
one stage seemed possible, the Concertacion might have achieved a more than
two-thirds congressional majority. Mr Frei's ability to reform the
constitution, something he has vowed to attempt, would have been
significantly strengthened.
It is a measure of Chile's long and stable democratic tradition that 17
years of military rule have not greatly affected voting patterns. For much
of the century the electorate has lined up in roughly equal blocks  - a
third on the right, a third in the centre and a third on the left. That
pattern was almost exactly repeated in last year's municipal elections.
Electoral rewards have usually gone to those parties best able to negotiate
pacts and coalitions across these voting blocks. The Concertacion has forged
an alliance of left and centre parties that will certainly win the elections
in December. But it has probably not done enough to upset the right's
crucial role in the balance of power.

FT  12 AUG 93 / Clinton gun-control plan: Anti-crime proposals would limit
appeals against execution
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton yesterday launched a broad set of proposals to combat
crime, with measures to control gun sales, hire more policemen and limit
appeals against the death penalty.
Mr Clinton promised to introduce a crime bill into Congress next month
offering Dollars 3.4bn (Pounds 2.3bn) to put up to 50,000 more police
officers on the beat, and called the proposals a 'major down payment' on his
campaign promise to use the power of the White House to prevent and punish
crime.
The package would also bring tighter controls on gun sales, including a new
drive to pass the Brady bill, which would require a five-day waiting period
before the purchase of a handgun.
'We must end the insanity of being able to buy or sell a handgun more easily
than obtaining a driver's licence,' Mr Clinton said.
The Brady bill, named after a former White House press secretary who was
shot during an assassination attempt on President Ronald Reagan, is now
widely supported by police chiefs, although few of them believe it would do
much to stem the availability of illegal weapons to criminals.
Mr Clinton ordered immediate executive action to ban the import of
assault-style handguns, and to tighten controls on the issue of licences for
gun dealers.
Current rules allow 280,000 people to sell guns under scant government
supervision, most of them working from home, in exchange for a fee of
Dollars 10 a year.
The proposed crime package also contains measures to extend the death
penalty, mostly applied at the state level, to a number of federal crimes,
and to limit prisoners sentenced to death by a state court to a single
habeas corpus appeal to the federal courts.
Although capital punishment was reauthorised by the Supreme Court in 1976,
and is widely supported in US public opinion, 15 times as many prisoners are
sentenced to death each year as are in fact executed.
The Supreme Court has become less and less receptive to appeals from death
row prisoners, but some state law enforcement officials still complain that
the appeals process can drag on for years.
Many of the measures proposed by Mr Clinton yesterday were contained in
crime legislation passed in 1991 and 1992 by both chambers of Congress, but
eventually blocked by Senate Republicans who wanted much tougher curbs on
habeas corpus rights.

STATE floodplain managers have begun working with the White House to develop
new approaches to flood control, in the wake of this year's devastating
Mississippi floods.
Mr Larry Larson, head of the floodplain management and dam safety programmes
for Wisconsin and executive director of the Association of State Floodplain
Managers, said yesterday his organisation had begun to work with Vice
President Al Gore and hoped to work out better ways of keeping people out of
harm's way.
'We as floodplain managers would hate to see the people affected by this
flood walk away thinking it will never happen again. It will happen again,'
Mr Larson said.
Mr Larson warned that many of the earthwork levees built along the river
were only designed to contain much lesser degrees of flooding. Sandbag
barricades on top of the levees simply increased the pressure elsewhere.
'Many of the people along the river understood that if that levee on the
other side of the river failed, their levee would be under much less
pressure,' he said.
Alternatives to building more and higher levees included relocating
individual buildings or whole communities on higher ground, or lifting
building foundations.
Some small towns badly hit by this year's floods have already started
discussions with the Federal Emergency Management Agency on the possibility
of moving to higher ground.
Mr Larson's call was echoed by Mr Kevin Coyle, head of the American Rivers
environmental group. Mr Coyle urged the White House to appoint a commission
to rethink the management of the Mississippi basin, and to throw its weight
behind a reform of the government flood insurance programme, which he said
had encouraged people to build in the path of likely flooding.
President Bill Clinton will sign a Dollars 6.3bn flood relief bill today in
St Louis, heart of the flood-stricken Midwest, Reuter reports.

FT  12 AUG 93 / Slovak premier personifies his republic's image problems:
Anthony Robinson, recently in Bratislava, reports on a new state's old-style
chief
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE Slovak nationalists who took their country into separate statehood on
January 1 argued, above all, that sovereignty would raise the profile of
Slovakia in the outside world.
Hastily trained ambassadors were sent out to new embassies, the new state
gained recognition from governments, the United Nations and a raft of other
international institutions, including, last month, the Council of Europe.
But there are legitimate doubts whether expensive international exposure has
done Slovakia much good. It has served to give a broader platform for Mr
Vladimir Meciar, prime minister, who led his Movement for a Democratic
Slovakia (HZDS) to victory in the polls a year ago and then to independence
from the Czech Republic.
Mr Meciar, whose unpredictable and contradictory domestic pronouncements
frequently offend ethnic minorities at home, insists on representing
Slovakia abroad on all possible occasions, having sacked his first foreign
minister, a popular former actor called Milan Knazko, four months ago. But
his lack of experience in foreign affairs, his resemblance to the old
lumbering Communist-era apparatchik, and lack of foreign languages reinforce
precisely the stereotypes of Slovak backwardness which the post-Communist
nationalist revival was meant to dispel.
Slovakia's entry into the Council of Europe, for example, was marred by
Hungarian protests about alleged discrimination against its 600,000-strong
ethnic minority in Slovakia. Only at the last moment did Budapest - which
had already taken another dispute over the controversial Gabcikovo dam on
the river Danube to international arbitration at The Hague - decide to
abstain and allow the Slovak application to proceed.
Shortly afterwards the Slovak parliament approved a liberal language law
which removed many of the Hungarian minority's complaints. But then, Mr
Meciar objected and demanded a revision of sensitive clauses, such as that
which dropped a requirement for ethnic Hungarian women to add the Slovak
ending to their names, turning a typical Hungarian name like Nagy into
Nagyova.
His decision to re-open a barely healed wound was characteristic. In July he
came back from a 10-nation regional co-operation summit in Budapest only to
announce that he had decided to acquire five supersonic MiG-29 jet fighters
from Russia. The aircraft and spares worth Dollars 180m (Pounds 120.8m)
would be acquired in part payment of Moscow's Soviet-era debt to Slovakia,
he said, mirroring an earlier Russian-Hungarian agreement under which
Budapest will take delivery of MiG-29 and other sophisticated military
equipment worth more than Dollars 800m.
Hungary justified its own acquisition by the conflict in neighbouring former
Yugoslavia. Its armed forces were kept deliberately weak by Moscow after the
Hungarian army joined anti-Communist rebels fighting Soviet forces in 1956.
But the risks were revealed last year when Yugoslav air force MiG-29s
several times violated Hungarian air space during raids on Croatian targets
in bordering Slavonia
Mr Meciar, however, chose to interpret the Hungarian move as confirmation of
Budapest's ambition to reintegrate Transylvania and southern Slovakia, with
their 3m strong ethnic Hungarian minorities, into a modern version of the
'greater Hungary' which was dismembered by the 1920 Trianon treaty.
But it remains to be seen whether Mr Meciar will be able to complete the
deal. Most of the military airports in former Czechoslovakia were sited in
the Czech Republic, closer to opposing Nato forces. The military clauses of
the complex inter-state divorce agreements divided the military assets of
the former federal state in ratio of 2: 1, reflecting the population split
of just over 10m Czechs and 5m Slovaks.
Slovakia now has far more aircraft than it can service or fly as a result.
Much of the equipment transported east is inadequately stored. Acquiring
even more military equipment would require substantial collateral spending
on training and maintenance beyond the means of the over-stretched Slovak
budget.
For, economically, Slovakia is in deep trouble. On July 9, Mr Julius Toth,
finance minister, announced a 10 per cent devaluation of the Slovak koruna,
This was six months after sending an IMF mission packing for proposing a
20-30 per cent devaluation which he attacked as being based on biased
figures produced by Prague.
To protect the economy, he argued instead for a 20 per cent import
surcharge. This has not been applied, but economists and potential investors
believe the koruna is still over-valued. Two-way trade with the Czech
Republic has fallen by more 30 per cent since January and foreign investors
have remained on the sidelines.
Slovakia received less than 10 per cent of foreign investment into the
former federal republic. It has become less attractive now that access to
the Czech market requires extensive paperwork and delays at the new border.
Foreign consultants report only desultory interest from the odd potential
investor: 'Kicking the tyres' of the new republic, in the words of one US
consultant.
Most deals are small and involve neighbouring Austrian or northern Italian
companies looking for cheap components. 'The Slovaks are good engineers and
good metal fabricators, but hopeless at sales and marketing,' one Italian
businessman commented.
European Community restrictions on steel imports have hit some of the
republic's most efficient enterprises, like the East Slovakian Steel Works
at Kosice in the east of the country.
Slovakia's post-independence economic malaise has been accentuated by a
Communist-era bureaucracy, lack of progress in privatisation and a wave of
government resignations, including that of Mr Lubomir Dolgos, the
privatisation minister. The haemorrhage of frustrated ministers has left Mr
Meciar isolated at the head of a minority government and searching for an
alliance with the small Slovak National party.
Meanwhile, higher taxes have been unable to fill the gap left by the
collapse in profitability of the big arms and other state enterprises. Loath
to reduce the bureaucracy, and committed to expensive prestige projects like
new theatres and the restoration of cultural monuments, the government is
being forced to cut pensions and social spending to try to keep the budget
within IMF-agreed limits.
Devaluation has cleared the way for a Dollars 90m 'systemic transition
facility' loan from the IMF with less conditionality than required on a
regular standby facility. But the government will be hard pressed to keep
the public sector deficit to Kcs15bn (Pounds 300m) given that the deficit
reached Kcs14bn by mid-July.

ROMANIA'S Jiu Valley coal miners returned to work yesterday after a nine-day
strike collapsed without apparently securing the large pay rises union
leaders had demanded.
The miners' union, the government, the Ministry of Industry and the RAH, the
state-owned company which administers the region's 13 coal mines, would not
release details of the settlement.
Rompres, the state news agency, said the union and the RAH had agreed on
monthly wages ranging from 146,000 lei (Pounds 122) for an unqualified
worker up to 207,000 lei for an underground miner, compared with an average
monthly wage of 224,000 lei which the union had demanded.
Before the strike, the region's 43,000 miners earned on average 40 per cent
more than other Romanian miners as well as receiving free coal, transport to
work, meals and subsidised electricity and rent.
The government said the strike had achieved nothing and it had stuck by its
original offer of an average monthly wage of 166,000 lei.
The union and the RAH had also agreed that 60 per cent of the 91bn lei
(Pounds 75.8m) government subsidy to the RAH for 1993 would be spent on
production and investment with the balance subsidising wages.
The Romanian train drivers' union yesterday launched its second strike in
two months, demanding new wage increases, causing further industrial chaos
just hours after the end of the strike by coalminers. Many main-line
stations were severely disrupted.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Boris Yeltsin yesterday sought to override parliament's efforts to
block mass privatisation, issuing a decree under which Moscow could punish
officials for failing to implement the legislation.
In addition, Mr Anatoly Chubais, deputy prime minister responsible for
privatisation, also said funds would be cut off to regions that failed to
fulfil the programme.
Mr Chubais said the decree and a similar government resolution were issued
in response to an attack on the programme by the parliament. He said
parliament was embarked on a 'crazy' political gamble since the process of
privatisation was too popular to be stopped.
The government resolution included a requirement that 30 per cent of
individual state enterprises be offered to the public three months after
they are turned into joint stock companies and that 70 per cent of stock on
offer be sold for privatisation vouchers distributed to every Russian
citizen.
The presidential decree said the privatisation programme, which includes a
list of enterprises earmarked for sale, could be submitted to parliament
only after it was approved by all of Russia's 89 regions.
This is seen as a delaying tactic since the process could last indefinitely
and would keep the legislation clear of parliamentary scrutiny.
Mr Chubais said the government resolution could not be reversed as
parliament does not have the right to do so. However, it has already twice
overturned Mr Yeltsin's presidential decrees on privatisation and could do
the same again.
Mr Yeltsin faces new attacks when parliament meets today. On its agenda are
proposals to convene a Congress of People's Deputies to strip Mr Yeltsin of
his role as commander-in-chief, and to set up a medical commission to
examine his health.
In an attempt to project new decisiveness on the part of the president, who
has promised his political opponents a 'combative September', a presidential
spokesman described Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, the parliamentary speaker, as a
'maniac'.
Mr Vyacheslav Kostikov, press spokesman, accused Mr Khasbulatov of trying to
draw the armed forces into politics by attacking the President at a meeting
with military officials on Tuesday.
'His accusations show not only the level of his political extremism but also
the maniacal imbalance of this figure, whose actions pose an increasing
danger to society,' Mr Kostikov said.
Mr Boris Fyodorov, the finance minister, said it was unlikely a handful of
former Soviet republics would be able soon to recreate either a rouble zone
or an economic union.
He denied Russia was seeking to write off debts to the west, saying that a
statement to this effect had been the personal opinion of Mr Konstantin
Kagalovsky, Russia's representative at the International Monetary Fund.
Negotiations were under way with republics that wanted to keep the rouble as
their currency, Mr Fyodorov said, but 'what will happen to the rouble zone
remains to be seen'.
The central bank's botched monetary reform, which proclaims to endow Russia
with a proper currency of its own and to cut off other republics, showed
'these issues cannot be resolved so easily', he added.
He was also sceptical of separate plans for economic union with Ukraine and
Belarus.

FT  12 AUG 93 / French overnight rate lowered to 9.25%
</HEADLINE>

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bank of France yesterday took its biggest step towards lower interest
rates since the effective flotation of the franc at the beginning of the
month. However, it confirmed its gradual approach towards reducing borrowing
costs.
The central bank cut overnight lending rates to 9.25 per cent, half a point
lower than the rate it set on Tuesday when it trimmed the 24-hour rate from
10 per cent.
The 5-10 day borrowing rate, suspended during the currency crisis at the end
of last month in an attempt to tighten liquidity and protect the franc, was
unchanged at 10 per cent.
Currency analysts in Paris said yesterday's move showed France was adopting
a 'step-by-step' approach to interest rate cuts following the widening of
the franc's fluctuation bands within the exchange rate mechanism from 2.25
per cent to 15 per cent.
'The direction is downwards, but cautiously,' said one economist in Paris.
'The government is not going to do anything to scare the currency markets
and has made it clear that it won't cut interest rates quickly as Britain
did after it left the ERM.'
The franc strengthened following the rate cut, rising by about one centime
to close at FFr3.511 to the D-Mark.
The French stock market, buoyed by the expectation of rate cuts, continued
its rally yesterday. The CAC-40 index rose by 1.3 per cent to close at
2,167, its highest level since April 1990. The index has risen by more than
4 per cent since the franc's ERM fluctuation bands were widened, despite the
slow progress towards reduced borrowing costs.
France's cautious approach to interest rate cuts has puzzled some economists
who believed the government would use its greater freedom within the ERM to
cut interest rates quickly in an attempt to stimulate the economy.
But Mr Edouard Balladur, prime minister, has staked his credibility on
maintaining a strong franc and is reluctant to risk a rapid depreciation of
the currency by aggressive interest rate cuts.

FT  12 AUG 93 / Izetbegovic gives Serbs two days to withdraw
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
BOSNIA'S President Alija Izetbegovic yesterday gave his Serb adversaries two
days to withdraw from key high ground overlooking Sarajevo, the besieged
capital, before he abandoned peace talks.
'I will stay here for two more days, then we will return to our Bosnia,' he
said after his delegation met international mediators Lord Owen and Mr
Thorvald Stoltenberg.
The mediators held separate meetings with Mr Izetbegovic and his Serb enemy,
Mr Radovan Karadzic. The talks concentrated on the military situation on
mounts Bjelasnica and Igman, south of Sarajevo.
But Mr Karadzic, Bosnian Serb leader, last night said: 'We hope to move our
troops out by 8am GMT and save the conference.' Earlier he dismissed as a
'shameful lie' reports that Serbs were being re-deployed on Bjelasnica.
Before entering talks he said the troops were replacing 'wet and cold'
soldiers.
The two peace envoys appeared frustrated by the delay and confusion over
whether Serb forces intended to honour their promise to withdraw. Mr John
Mills, their spokesman, admitted: 'There is evidence of a Serb withdrawal. .
. What we are having trouble ascertaining is the extent of the withdrawal
and how genuine a withdrawal might be.' He said Mr Karadzic had been told by
the co-chairmen in very clear terms that 'all his troops should leave
Igman'. Mount Igman is of greater importance to the mainly Moslem Bosnian
army because it includes a military supply route which leads to Sarajevo.
Mr Mills yesterday dismissed reports that the co-chairmen were exerting
pressure on the Bosnian government to accept the Serb plan to divide the
Bosnian capital. He said they did not favour any solution and cited a
weekend report to the UN Security Council suggesting 'it may not be possible
to negotiate a permanent solution in Sarajevo for some time'.
Mr Karadzic has endorsed the 'temporary solution', raising Moslem fears that
it amounted to approval for the ethnic division of the Bosnian capital.
According to the 1991 census, Moslems comprised a majority in each of the
six districts of Sarajevo where more than a third of marriages crossed
ethnic lines.
Geneva conference officials yesterday welcomed the ratification of another
military paper aimed at ending the war. The commanders of the Bosnian, Serb
and Croat armies agreed to halt any offensives and freeze their troops in
current positions.

SEVERAL countries yesterday offered transport and hospital places for the
seriously ill and wounded from Sarajevo, write Our Foreign Staff and Reuter.
A spokesman for the UN High Commissioner for Refugees in Zagreb talked of
dozens of offers.
Britain, Sweden and Ireland announced they would arrange for the evacuation
of 41 emergency medical cases from the city within the next two days. In a
joint statement in Stockholm, Mr Carl Bildt and Mr John Major, prime
ministers of Sweden and Britain respectively, said 20 of the injured would
be taken to the UK, 16 to Sweden and five to Ireland.
The move, in response to an appeal from the UNHCR, follows Mr Major's
decision earlier this week to order the immediate evacuation of a severely
injured five-year-old girl, now being treated in a London hospital.
The Saudi ambassador to Britain, Ghazi al-Gosaibi, announced that his
country had promised Pounds 100,000 towards the cost of transport. In Rome,
the Italian foreign ministry said it had contacted the UNHCR to solicit 'the
most urgent cases of wounded Bosnian children'. And a Dutch foreign ministry
spokesman in The Hague said Fl 3m (Pounds 1.05m) had been set aside to treat
wounded Bosnian children.

AN ESTIMATED 100,000 ethnic Slovaks, most of them living in the Czech
Republic, have applied to relinquish their citizenship since Czechoslovakia
broke into separate states, a Slovak official said yesterday, Reuter reports
from Bratislava. Some 500 a day applied last month, she said, but the figure
was now falling.
Under Czech regulations, Slovaks with two years' residence in the Czech
Republic have until the end of this year to trade in their Slovak passports
for Czech ones, a swap that requires formally giving up their Slovak
nationality. Only a few hundred Czechs have applied for Slovak citizenship.
The Czech Republic has one of Europe's lowest unemployment rates - 2.5 per
cent - and a bustling economy. Slovakia, in contrast, has slid further into
decline since partition.

FT  12 AUG 93 / Allies set for air strikes against Serbs in Bosnia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   LONDON, WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ALL THE military arrangements for allied air strikes against the Serbs in
Bosnia, including air control, were now in place and being tested, the
United Nations said yesterday. But as Nato military planners met in Belgium
to finalise a list of possible targets, the allies were still divided about
just what action by the Serbs would trigger air strikes - or what action
would be needed to avert them.
Under the terms of the military agreement approved by the Nato council on
Monday air strikes can only begin if they have been specifically requested
by Nato or the United Nations and been approved by both Admiral Jeremy
Boorda, Nato's commander of Allied Forces Southern Europe, and General Jean
Cot, commander of UN troops in Bosnia.
In addition, the Serbs must be given a clear warning - a state of affairs
that will rule out any 'surprise' attacks.
Nato planners have outlined a series of several different military options
for action. The type of operations that are understood to have been under
consideration include:
the bombing of artillery positions around Sarajevo and other areas;
attacks on supply routes from Serbia to the Bosnian Serbs;
attacks on Serb command and control positions and possibly on the Serbian
stronghold of Pale near Sarajevo.
Earlier US calls for broader action against targets outside Bosnia have been
knocked off the agenda by fierce allied opposition.
Nato aircraft in the Adriatic yesterday stepped up their training exercises
across Bosnia, collecting photographic material for air strike planning.
However, military experts say that, initially, strikes around Sarajevo are
the most likely course of action.
Dr Jonathan Eyal, of the Royal United Services Institute, said: 'If the
Canadians and others have signed up, it is unlikely they have agreed to
anything more than bombing around Sarajevo, given that their troops are in
Srebrenica.'
The Nato political council is now meeting almost daily to review the
situation in Bosnia - the first step, officials say, in assessing whether
air strikes would be necessary.
But although Monday's statement set out conditions for air strikes -
including attacks on troops under UN command, continued disruption of water
and humanitarian supplies to Sarajevo, and rather more controversially, the
'strangulation' of other safe areas - so far Nato has not published any
clear list of 'triggers' or 'ultimatums' for action.
Nato officials claim this is because they do not want to play 'cat and
mouse' with the Serbs. 'We have seen that the Serbs are very good at running
around ultimatums. We don't want to play into their hands,' one said.
However, amid widespread suspicions that the European allies lack the
political will to press ahead with strikes, the lack of clarity about the
triggers would also seem to be concealing divisions within Nato about the
readiness to take military action and uncertainty about their longer term
objectives for the area - a situation that left some officials in Brussels
hopefully suggesting that the apparent deal made in Sarajevo yesterday
between military commanders might stave off the need for a decision.
French and British diplomatic sources yesterday indicated they considered
attacks on UN troops the most likely reason for air strikes.
They pointed out that in spite of the political significance Mount Igman had
assumed, a Serb presence on the mountain would not in itself probably be
reason for action, since the mountain did not have a specific humanitarian
significance.
However, the US State Department said last night that continued occupation
of the mountain would be 'a very materially relevant' criterion for
triggering air strikes. 'Occupation of those mountains (Igman and
Bjelasnica) is a critical element of the Serbs' ability to strangle
Sarajevo,' a spokesman said. The strangulation of the city was one of the
criteria that would trigger a Nato response.
He added that the US considered the formal warning, called for in the Nato
document about air strikes, had already been issued to the Serbs.
Nevertheless, according to Mr Marshall Harris, one of three former US
officials who have resigned in Washington in the past week in protest at the
US position on Bosnia, there are now deep divisions within the American
military over the issue. Defence Department officials have estimated that
they can take out 70 per cent of the Serbian artillery within a day by using
air strikes, Mr Harris said.

Mr Kait Maruste, court chairman, said local councils such as Narva's have no
power to deal with issues of national interest.
'A town council can deal with local issues only. The town council referendum
on the ethnic-territorial issue is. . . unconstitutional.'

FT  12 AUG 93 / Nato planners draw up Bosnia air-strike targets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A LIST of Serbian targets for allied air strikes in Bosnia was being
finalised yesterday by military planners at Nato headquarters in Belgium.
But officials indicated that the allies were a long way from agreeing
precisely what action by Serbs in the former Yugoslav republic would trigger
air strikes - or what would avert them.
Under the terms of the military agreement approved by the Nato council on
Monday, air strikes can only begin if they have been specifically requested
and approved by both United Nations and Nato leaders and if the Serbs have
been given a clear warning, which effectively rules out 'surprise' attacks.
Nato planners have outlined various military options for action. The type of
operations understood to be under consideration include:
the bombing of artillery positions around Sarajevo, the Bosnian capital;
attacks on supply routes from Serbia;
attacks on Serb command and control positions and possibly attacks on the
Serbian stronghold of Pale near Sarajevo.
Military experts yesterday stressed that initially the most likely course of
action would be strikes around Sarajevo. Dr Jonathan Eyal, of the Royal
United Services Institute, an independent think-tank, said: 'If the
Canadians and others have signed up, it is unlikely that they have agreed to
anything more than bombing around Sarajevo, given that their troops are out
in Srebrenica.'
French and British diplomatic sources yesterday indicated that attacks on UN
troops remained the most likely reason for air strikes, and indicated that
in spite of the political significance that Mt Igman has assumed, a renewed
Serb assault on the mountain would not necessarily prompt action. However,
US officials have indicated that continued expansion of Serb territory could
be a reason for action.

FT  12 AUG 93 / Bonn cabinet backs cuts: Waigel presses on with social
spending curbs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE FACE of a continuing storm of criticism from both left and right, Mr
Theo Waigel, the German finance minister, yesterday pushed the draft laws
for tough cuts in social spending through the German cabinet.
The DM21bn (Pounds 8.3bn) package of cuts in next year's spending, rising to
DM27bn in 1995 and nearly DM29bn by 1996, still faces a rough ride through
the Bundestag, the lower house of parliament.
Not only the opposition Social Democrats, but also the Free Democrats in the
ruling coalition, want amendments.
Mr Waigel insisted that the cuts would not undermine any recovery from the
economic recession, pointing out that federal government spending would
still be DM20bn higher in 1994 than in the current year and the budget
deficit constant at DM67.5bn.
He was slightly more cautious than Mr Gunter Rexrodt, the economics
minister, in forecasting an economic growth rate of just 1.0 per cent in
1994 (compared with Mr Rexrodt's 1.5 per cent). But he was less pessimistic
on unemployment, suggesting a rise from 3.5m to 3.7m, instead of the 4m
total seen by the economics minister for the end of the year.
The main element in the Waigel package is a cut of three percentage points
in a range of social benefits, including unemployment benefit and social
security payments. There are to be curbs on child allowances, abolition of
special 'bad weather' payments to construction workers, and a clampdown on
social security fraud.
Coming when unemployment is rising sharply - up from 7.0 to 7.5 per cent
last month in west Germany - the package has aroused opposition fury. Mr
Oskar Lafontaine, deputy leader of the SPD, called it a 'violation of
economic reason and social justice'. Ms Monika Wulf-Mathies, leader of the
public sector workers' union, called it a social explosive, which parliament
must defuse. The German trade union movement has announced protests for the
autumn.
At the same time, the FDP has served notice that it wants to delay abolition
of the bad weather subsidy for the construction industry, saying it could
undermine the national house-building programme. The industry maintains the
government will end up paying as much in unemployment benefits to building
workers laid off in bad weather as it currently pays in the job subsidy.
The SPD enjoys an effective majority in the Bundesrat, the upper house of
parliament, but only a small part of the total package can be blocked. More
than 90 per cent of the package does not require Bundesrat approval, and can
therefore be confirmed by a majority in the lower house.

FT  12 AUG 93 / Submarine refit decision was flawed say MPs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT used 'flawed and potentially unfair' methods to reach an
'unsafe' decision last month to refit Trident nuclear submarines in
Devonport, Plymouth, rather than Rosyth, Scotland, a Commons select
committee report said yesterday.
The work, worth between Pounds 3bn and Pounds 5bn over 20 years, was given
to Devonport after a two-year struggle between the yards.
The report, from the cross-party committee chaired by Conservative MP Sir
Nicholas Bonsor, said the government's claim that Devonport's bid to build
new docks was Pounds 64m cheaper than Rosyth's was unsafe because it was
less than the margin for error in the calculations.
'No commercial enterprise would rely solely on such a small marginal
difference in estimated costs,' said the report.
It also criticised the elimination of competition in submarines at a time
when it was being encouraged in surface ship work. The MoD should now
publish details of how it evaluated 'non-cost factors', it said.
The MoD argued yesterday that the savings that would arise from maintaining
competition were much less than the Pounds 300m to be saved by allocating
the work to just one yard. The ministry plans to produce more detailed
figures and publish them in a formal written reply, probably before
parliament is recalled after the summer recess in October.
At the time of the decision, the government softened the blow to Rosyth by
promising it refitting work on surface ships. But the report argued it was
'essential that ministers should seek to enshrine their commitment to
allocation of refits to Rosyth in some binding form'.
Mr George Foulkes, Labour defence spokesman, said he would be writing to Mr
Malcolm Rifkind, secretary of state for defence, asking him to provide this
guarantee. In his evidence to the committee last month, Mr Rifkind said a
legally-binding contract covering warship refitting would not be suitable
because the future management of the dockyards would be dec-ided in 1995
when current contracts with private sector managers expire.
The report urged an early decision on the management of the Royal Dockyards
beyond 1995. 'Uncertainty will tend to inhibit the ability of the Royal
Dockyards to attract non-MoD work,' it said, adding that the time taken to
reach such decisions was 'highly regrettable'.
Until 1991, the MoD planned to proceed with a scheme to build a new dock at
Rosyth for refitting the 16,000-ton Trident submarines. Then Devonport
submitted an unsolicited proposal suggesting the upgrade of its existing
docks as a cheaper alternative. The MoD then formally invited both dockyards
to make proposals for nuclear refitting work.

FT  12 AUG 93 / Manufacturing recovery wavers: Business leaders lack
confidence in economy despite growing strength of equities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH and MICHAEL CASSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EXPECTATIONS about a strong manufacturing recovery have slipped back in
several UK regions, according to a Confederation of British Industry survey
published yesterday which underlines fears that the economic upturn may be
slowing.
While indicating that weak export demand from the rest of Europe is holding
back growth, the survey said manufacturing order books in six out of the 11
regions had fallen from levels four months ago.
The report said the expected drop in export orders across the country had
hit especially hard in three regions which up to now had been leading the
recovery - Yorkshire and Humberside, East Midlands and Wales.
Companies in three other regions - south-west and north-west England and
Northern Ireland - also expect falls in export orders over the next four
months.
The findings from the survey, conducted jointly with Business Strategies, an
economics consultancy, were supported by views from senior UK business
executives who said the recovery was far from robust and might not be
sustained in the second half of the year.
Mr Richard Freeman, chief economist at ICI, said demand in the
industrialised world continued to be 'very patchy', echoing a warning on
Tuesday by BOC Group, the industrial gases company.
Sir Anthony Gill, chairman and chief executive of engineering company Lucas
Industries, was 'cautious' about a UK recovery because signs of domestic
growth had not been matched elsewhere in Europe.
Mr Roger Hurn, chairman and chief executive of Smiths Industries, the
engineering group, said: 'We have yet to see all this talk of improvement
reflected in our UK order books.'
The survey came on the same day as the FT-SE 100 index of leading shares
broke through 3,000 for the first time.
Mr Charles Burton, joint managing director of Business Strategies, said the
report pointed to an upturn, with 'the recovery feeding to more UK regions'
in which output expansion had been relatively slack.
But 'there was no neat pattern' to the gradual strengthening in demand and
output, and the survey indicated that the manufacturing recovery would slow
over the next few months. The survey comes after strong manufacturing and
export growth helped to lift the UK economy in the early part of the year.
With consumer spending growing slowly because of high personal debts,
manufacturing is expected to be an important factor in any sustained upturn.
The relatively downbeat sentiments from the report were echoed by Mr Simon
Duffy, finance director of the Thorn EMI electronics and leisure company,
who said the upturn was 'uneven'. For Mr Andrew Robb, finance director of
Pilkington, the glass company, Britain was 'just bumping up from the
bottom', with a particular question mark over sales prospects in Germany,
while Mr Rod Sellers, chief executive of the British Vita plastics company,
said: 'I am still looking for the green shoots.'
While the report said business optimism among UK manufacturers had
strengthened in the past three months, only in Scotland was the rise in
confidence greater than that seen in a similar survey in April. The latest
poll questioned 1,346 companies between June 25 and July 14.

FT  12 AUG 93 / FT-SE 100 breaks 3,000 level for first time: Anticipation of
rate cuts boosts markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND and JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FT-SE 100 index, the London stock market's favourite method of measuring
its daily performance, broke through the 3,000 level for the first time
yesterday amid increasing speculation that UK base rates would be cut,
boosting the performance of Britain's industrial and commercial companies.
The index, which tracks the share prices of the top 100 British companies by
market capitalisation, rose 34.5 points yesterday to close at 3,006.1.
The strong performance, which shrugged aside concerns in British industry
about the weakness of the recovery, was accompanied by a rise in UK bond
prices and a record high for equities in the French stock market.
All of these markets have rallied powerfully in the wake of the recent
widening of the fluctuation bands in the European exchange rate mechanism as
investors take the view that European governments, including Britain's, will
cut interest rates in an attempt to boost their economies.
Although most European countries have left their interest rates unchanged
since the reform of the ERM, France yesterday triggered renewed enthusiasm
in British and French equity markets by cutting the cost of overnight
lending to commercial banks by  1/2 a percentage point to 9.25 per cent.
The move was interpreted by some financial market analysts as modest,
because France has not reduced its official interest rates since the ERM
reform.
But the franc appreciated against the D-Mark in the wake of yesterday's
easing in monetary policy, suggesting that the French central bank may have
room to cut interest rates again in the near future.
In London, the French move was seen as another indication that the UK
authorities could cut rates later this year without adversely affecting the
pound. This week the Bank of England raised hopes that rates could be cut by
saying the prospect of a rise in inflation was very low.
Yesterday's advance in the London stock market followed a series of rallies
which have already pushed equity prices up by about 2.5 per cent this month.
Overall, the index has risen by some 26 per cent since sterling left the ERM
on September 16.
The latest surge in the FT-SE 100 has mainly been led by financial, property
and consumer stocks, all of which could benefit if base rates were cut from
their current level of 6 per cent.
The property and stores sectors have also moved up sharply, and there has
been a significant recovery in construction, engineering and motor stocks
which stand to benefit quickly from overall economic improvement.
The leading performers, however, have been shares in the merchant banking
sector which have outperformed the equity market by nearly 12 per cent this
month. Increased trading in securities, and the prospect of lower interest
rates, have led investors to believe that this sector will enjoy improved
profitability.
In France, the CAC-40 share index rose 27.61 points, or 1.29 per cent, to
finish at an all-time high of 2,167.39. The Paris bourse has already surged
some 3.9 per cent since the ERM reform. But the rise follows a string of
poor sales figures announced by companies for the first half of this year,
and some analysts have suggested that the rise in equity prices may be too
optimistic.
In New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average also closed at a record high
of 3,585.35, up 10.62 points, as US equities edged higher on the back of
tumbling bond yields.

FT  12 AUG 93 / EC moves to repair damage of currency crisis
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
LEADING European Community governments, including France, Germany and Italy,
are to prepare proposals to limit the damage caused by the recent currency
crisis and restore the credibility of the process leading to economic and
monetary union.
A special meeting of EC central bank governors is expected to be called in
the coming weeks, followed by the EC monetary committee, to prepare plans to
be presented to the expected extraordinary Community summit to be held in
Brussels at the end of October.
In Paris yesterday it was announced that Mr Edouard Balladur, the French
prime minister, would meet Chancellor Helmut Kohl in Bonn on August 26, for
their first meeting since last week's European exchange rate mechanism
crisis strained relations between their countries.
Meanwhile, Mr Carlo Ciampi, the Italian prime minister, has written to Mr
Kohl, Mr Jacques Delors, the president of the European Commission, and Mr
Edmond Alphandery, the French economy minister, calling for an initiative to
reinforce European currency co-operation, and to keep the process towards a
single currency on track.
'Things are starting to move,' one senior European official said yesterday.
'You can hear the boiler-room starting to cook.'
Fears have been voiced, however, that some EC member states may seek to
reimpose partial controls on capital movements as the only effective way of
preventing the sort of massive currency speculation which precipitated the
ERM crisis.
Any such move would be fiercely resisted by Britain, Germany and the
Netherlands, the member states which are most committed to freedom of
capital movements.
'It would mean destroying the present currency market, and that is why I
think it is inconceivable,' the official said. 'Yet I can imagine that it
will be proposed. There would be accusations that we are building not only a
trade fortress Europe, but a monetary fortress too.'
Mr Kohl's determination to maintain the momentum towards Emu has been
repeatedly stressed by Bonn officials in recent days, in spite of his public
speculation about the possibility of delays in the timetable.
Yesterday, Mr Theo Waigel, the German finance minister, confirmed that
strict maintenance of the criteria for economic convergence of the EC member
states - including limits on their budget deficits and inflation rates - was
more important for Germany than the precise timetable.
That could mean an extended period of preparation for eventual monetary
union, he agreed.

Correction (published 14th August 1993) appended to this article.
VIRGIN, the UK leisure group, has agreed to close its Paris megastore on
Sundays for the rest of the summer.
Mr Richard Branson, Virgin's founder, said yesterday that the store on the
Champs-Elysees had decided to suspend Sunday opening because it was clear
that no decision on the issue would be taken during the summer when
ministers were on holiday.
Mr Branson said: 'With every day that's gone by we've been hoping for a
response from the government. But the government are on holiday and they're
not responding. August is not a good time in France to be campaigning for
anything.'
Mr Branson said the FFr1m (Pounds 110,000) fine imposed on the group by a
French court last week for each Sunday the store was open would make trading
difficult. The fine represented nearly a third of takings last Sunday when
about 75,000 people visited the store, he said. The fine was reduced from an
original penalty of FFr4m.
Mr Branson repeated his threat to cancel expansion plans in France unless
the store was allowed to open on Sunday. The group plans to open a further
25 outlets in France.
Mr Patrick Zelnick, chairman of Virgin in France, said the decision to
suspend Sunday opening should be seen as a 'peace gesture' to the
authorities.
'We've decided to stop opening on Sundays to take the drama out of the
situation,' said Mr Zelnick, who has for the past two years orchestrated
Virgin's battle against France's ban on Sunday trading which dates back to
1906.
Virgin's decision follows an announcement by Mr Michel Giraud, employment
minister, to initiate a parliamentary debate in October on Sunday trading
which could lead to Virgin and other stores being exempted from the general
ban.
Virgin has adopted a high profile in France in the four years since opening
the successful Champs-Elysees store. The Sunday trading campaign has turned
out to be one of Mr Zelnick's most successful promotional ploys, both in
terms of generating free publicity for the company and in enhancing Virgin's
image as a younger, more fashionable version of Fnac, the vast chain of
music and book shops that has for decades been the dominant force in French
leisure retailing.
Mr Branson said yesterday that Virgin had been given permission by the
authorities in Barcelona to open its megastore in the city on Sundays.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MEXICO is slightly changing its tune on the North American Free Trade
Agreement.
Once hailed as the crowning achievement of President Carlos Salinas,
officials are at pains to stress it is now just one element of the
government's economic plan and certainly not indispensable to future
stability and growth.
The shift in emphasis has come as negotiations on side agreements have
dragged out longer than expected and Congressional opposition has grown.
Mexican officials, including the president, who used to insist there would
be a pact by January 1 next year, now prefer to say there will be a treaty
'eventually'.
The irony is that Canada, long considered Mexico's ally in Nafta
negotiations, seems the stumbling block.
According to reports in Mexico, an agreement would already have been reached
had Canada not objected to imposition of a combination of fines and
sanctions on countries that do not enforce their environmental and labour
laws.
If Canada does not budge, Mexico faces the dilemma of whether it should
enter into its own side agreements with the US, excluding Canada, to break
the impasse.
Since the US Congress is worried about the lack of Mexican rather than
Canadian enforcement of labour and environmental laws, this might break the
impasse but would be considered an embarrassing defeat for Mexico.
Reports that Canada would be excluded from some of the interventionist
provisions of the side agreements were firmly denied in a communique issued
by the three countries on Monday.
A Mexican official expressed optimism yesterday that an agreement which
applied equally to the three could still be found.

Taiwan's ruling Nationalist party formally split for the first time in more

The six legislators, including two former ministers, accused the party
leadership of failing to halt rampant corruption and dragging its feet on
internal reform, and announced the formation of the New party. It is the
first formal split among the Nationalists since they fled to Taiwan after
losing the Chinese civil war in 1949.
The MPs' departure has lowered the number of seats the Nationalists hold in
the 160-member parliament to 96 from 102. The opposition Democratic
Progressive party (DPP) has 52 seats.

THE STORM of disapproval about the European Commission's weekend decision to
put short-term restrictions on aluminium imports from the Commonwealth of
Independent States increased in ferocity yesterday.
Mr Paul O'Neill, chairman of the Aluminium Company of America, the world's
biggest aluminium group, warned that the EC's move would certainly increase
trade friction and might force the US industry to ask its government to take
retaliatory action.
Russia's foreign economic relations ministry accused the EC of 'betrayal'
and added: 'Restrictions on aluminium imports from Russia contradict
numerous declarations of Community representatives about support for Russian
reforms and trade liberalisation.'
Intercomalum, the CIS aluminium industry's trade association, said the EC
had given no hint that it would take such draconian action and suggested
'this will confuse the (aluminium) market and create unnecessary disorder'.
The EC said at the weekend that the European aluminium industry was being
'seriously damaged' by the surge in imports from the CIS and that imports
until the end of November would be limited to 60,000 tonnes.
In June, Alcoa cut production at its smelters by 25 per cent, partly in the
hope of heading off action by the EC. At that time Mr O'Neill, a fervent
free-trade advocate, insisted that the western aluminium industry had to
learn to live with the changed situation following the collapse of the
former Soviet Union and should not resort to protectionism.
Yesterday he said he had followed Alcoa's June cuts with talks with US trade
officials in the hope that they would raise the issue with the EC. But,
apparently, nothing had been done. He was 'extremely disappointed' by the EC
decision, which he called a 'futile action'; the market gave its judgment in
a decisive way by dropping the price of aluminium substantially.
Mr O'Neill said the EC statement showed the futility of the commission's
restrictions by stressing that there were not enough statistics available to
see what was going on in the CIS industry.
The restrictions would have little impact because the industry would swap
CIS aluminium for that made in Brazil or North America and send that to
Europe.
'The only logical way to make the scheme effective is for the EC to restrict
imports from anywhere in the world to 60,000 tonnes in the next four months.
'Clearly we have to assume more Russian metal will be directed towards the
US. This is unfair trade, so I must get my lawyers and trade experts
together to see if we can stop that flow. If this is the way our political
leaders want to play, then we must act to protect ourselves,' he said.
Mr Elliot Spitz, a vice chairman of Intercomalum, said there had been two
meetings between the CIS industry, Russian government and EC officials.
Intercomalum had assumed that negotiations would continue until satisfactory
arrangements about imports to the EC could be worked out.
More talks were scheduled for September and, while Intercomalum did not
expect that the present restrictions would be lifted, 'we are much more
concerned to prevent an extension to the restrictions'.
As for the EC complaint that the CIS industry had failed to provide
statistics, Mr Spitz pointed out that this was caused by the collapse of
centralised structures as the Soviet Union broke up.
But today all the CIS aluminium industry's plants were open to receive
western visitors and 'there is no doubt about the willingness of the
industry to co-operate with the west'.
Meanwhile, the Russian foreign economic relations ministry urged the
commission to drop the restrictions and instead stand by an agreement
reached in July to explore alternative ways for limiting CIS exports.
It said the EC's unilateral action was a serious blow to Russia's economy
and trade and at odds with the EC's previous support of Russian economic
reforms.

FT  11 AUG 93 / Copper-coloured outlook
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When RTZ bought BP Minerals in 1989, it became owner of the giant Bingham
Canyon copper mine in Utah, the largest in the US. It was a bold move. Spoil
heaps more than 1,000 feet high, clearly visible from the centre of Salt
Lake City 15 miles away, were a huge environmental liability. Bingham had
also been shut down by labour troubles in the mid-1980s, and much of the
processing plant was obsolete, writes David Lascelles.
But RTZ thought it had a good deal, because Bingham's copper deposits were
world class and, with good management, capable of being mined at low cost.
The board approved a Dollars 1.1bn programme of investments to raise ore
recovery and modernise the smelter and refinery. It also gave the operating
company back the name that BP had removed: Kennecott.
Three years later, RTZ has managed to get Bingham's production costs down,
but weak copper prices have squeezed profits.
Mr Bob Cooper, Kennecott's newly appointed chief executive officer, says:
'Kennecott is positioned to handle that. We are the lowest-cost US
producer.' Mr Cooper thinks Bingham can even aspire to produce the cheapest
copper in the world if it uses technology to the full.
'Now that we're run by a mining company and not an oil company, it's very
different,' he says. 'BP wanted quick returns.'
The environmental aspects are more complicated. Bingham is a potential
target of Washington's Superfund programme, under which sites are
compulsorily cleaned up at the owner's expense. To head off this risk
Kennecott is negotiating an action plan with the authorities. A Dollars 30m
water containment and landscaping project has already been launched, and the
new smelter will help clean the air.
Mr Kent Gray, director of remediation in Utah's Environmental Quality
Bureau, says: 'There's a lot of concern from the public and regulatory
agencies. But we're pleased with the progress Kennecott has made.'
A point going for RTZ - which claims to have raised Kennecott's
environmental standards since it took over - is that it is one of Utah's
largest employers, so the state is keen to avoid regulatory overkill. RTZ
has asked Kennecott to prepare plans showing how the two-mile wide pit will
be shut down when the ore runs out in 35 years - something it had not
previously done.

FT  11 AUG 93 / Leading Article: Pricing drugs
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ON THE FACE of it, the UK drugs industry has been let off lightly under
yesterday's proposed five-year deal with the Department of Health. The 2.5
per cent price cut is less than might have been expected, while there has
been no tightening of the overall profit control mechanism. A 17 to 21 per
cent target for return on capital employed is generous by comparison with
the average 12.5 per cent earned by British industry as a whole.
But the pharmaceutical price regulation scheme cannot be seen in isolation.
In its attempt to control the Pounds 3.4bn National Health Service drugs
bill - which is growing at more than 10 per cent a year - the government has
also curbed doctors' prescription budgets and is extending the blacklist of
medicines it will refuse to pay for on the grounds that they are too
expensive or non-essential. The latter plan in particular has provoked cries
of protest from the industry, with dire warnings that it could undermine its
international competitiveness while harming patient care.
These complaints should, in the main, be dismissed. Although the NHS's
position as near-monopoly purchaser of prescription drugs in the UK could
theoretically allow it to drive an excessively hard bargain, there is no
evidence that it has actually abused its power in this way. Rather it has
sought to develop a long-term relationship, which has allowed British
pharmaceutical companies to invest in research and shine in world markets '
earning Pounds 3bn a year in exports.
But at a time when cost-cutting is necessary throughout the public sector in
order to contain the budget deficit, it is only right that the drugs bill
should bear some of the strain. To achieve this, it is legitimate for the
government to refuse to pay for drugs where cheaper but adequate substitutes
are available or where it is reasonable for patients to pay themselves. What
is being proposed is less drastic than similar moves to control drugs bills
in other countries such as Germany, where blacklists are broader and
doctors' salaries are docked if they exceed their prescription budgets.
In so far as there is valid criticism of the government's approach, it is
over the way the blacklists have been implemented, rather than the
principle. Because there has been no clear explanation of how drugs will be
chosen for the blacklist, the industry says it may not go to the expense and
trouble of launching certain categories of drugs out of fear that they could
be blacklisted, or their prices artificially suppressed.
To avoid this danger, it is important that the government sets out openly
the criteria for drawing up such lists and reassures the industry that
innovative new drugs will earn premium prices. That way, it will be able to
continue its tricky balancing act of safeguarding patients' and taxpayers'
interests while supporting one of the few British industries still at the
top of the world league.

FT  11 AUG 93 / Leading Article: A sceptical Bank
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BANK of England's new freedom to publish a quarterly and critical
commentary on the Treasury's economic policy and performance is a valuable
and thoroughly un-British innovation. The underlying message of yesterday's
inflation report seems to be that the government has not yet done enough to
convince either the financial markets, or the Bank, that it will meet its
medium-term inflation targets. But its rather elliptical style still makes
it a challenge to discern what the Bank really thinks.
In the short-term, the clear message of the Bank's report is that
inflationary pressures are not a pressing problem for UK economic
management. Despite nascent recovery and falling unemployment, there is
still plenty of disinflation left in the system. Monetary growth remains
sluggish, employment is falling and wage inflation and settlements are
subdued. Lower unit labour costs have offset the recent rise in import
prices.
The Bank's central projection is that underlying inflation will remain
within the government's 1-4 per cent target range over the next two years.
It thus clears the way for a further cut in short-term interest rates this
autumn. Assuming that the government's popularity remains low, and the
recovery remains weak and patchy, such a rate cut is likely to be as
politically necessary as it is economically sensible.
But the inflation report provides a powerful counterweight to the idea that
the recent bond market rally implies that the medium-term inflation threat
has also disappeared. The rally in long-term government bonds has reduced
nominal yields on gilts by around a percentage point since May but also
knocked a quarter point off index-linked gilt yields. Expected inflation
over the next decade - measured by the gap between nominal and real yields -
thus remains around 5 per cent, inconsistent with the government's inflation
target. This gap has narrowed by around half a point over the last three
months, but remains higher than before sterling left the exchange rate
mechanism last autumn.
The Bank provides two explanations for this market scepticism: the
likelihood that wage inflation will accelerate when the recovery arrives,
and the risk that some future government will choose to monetise Britain's
growing public debt. The Bank offers no advice about how to deal with the
wage problem. But on fiscal policy, it is more forthright, hinting strongly
that the Treasury has not yet done enough to cut the budget deficit.
There is a third reason for these investor nerves. No sensible banker would
wilfully impose an unnecessarily high burden on future tax-payers. But the
Bank continues to issue gilts at a minimum five year maturity even though
the yield curve is steeply sloped. There can be only one explanation: in its
heart, the Bank does not really believe in the government's inflation target
either.

FT  11 AUG 93 / Deep appetite for deposits: Why does RTZ, the world's
largest mining company, keep a low profile and resist the urge to speculate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Digging very large holes in other people's countries is an occupation that
requires sensitive political antennae as well good mining skills.
Few companies know this better than RTZ, the largest mining company in the
world. Its decision earlier this week to cut its stake in the Lihir Island
gold project in Papua New Guinea from 80 per cent to only 20 per cent is
seen as an act of political as well as commercial caution.
Lihir Island is one of the largest gold deposits in the world. But it lies
in a country where an RTZ affiliate has already had to close a copper mine -
Bougainville - because of local uprisings. The deposit is also situated at
the bottom of a volcanic crater full of hot water and is potentially
expensive to extract. So while Lihir Island fitted RTZ's appetite for large
deposits, it lacked the company's other requirements of political stability
and low cost.
RTZ's business philosophy has been honed by decades of experience, much of
it uncomfortable, even bitter. This has taught it to take a low profile and
be rigorous with its sums. It runs its Pounds 7bn empire from inconspicuous
offices in the corner of St James's Square in London's West End. It does not
plaster its name over its operations: you will search in vain for any sign
of RTZ's proprietorship at most of its mines. Its chairman, Sir Derek
Birkin, an undemonstrative but tough-minded Yorkshireman, shuns the
limelight.
In a recent interview, he said: 'It's an emotive business . . . We don't
like to go in with our heavy boots on.'
But behind the low-key exterior, the company's strategy has a clear
objective: to secure for RTZ the strongest possible position in whichever
market it decides to enter. The company's global structure is held together
by tight budget controls and short communication lines. However, in order to
cater for the strong local sensibilities of its operations, regional
managers are given a high degree of autonomy: they are supposed to know how
to handle decisions on the ground, deal with local politicians, smooth the
way for RTZ's plans, set the priorities. This allows Sir Derek to run a
business that has some 67,500 employees with a headquarters staff of only
250 people.
'It's hard work, this management style,' he says. 'We all have to travel a
lot.'
But if RTZ is now arguably the most successful leading British company in
its field, it only got there after painful upheavals.
It began as a Victorian mining finance house which invested in new mining
ventures, and gradually came to own and operate mines itself. A strong
period of growth came after the merger of Rio Tinto and Consolidated Zinc
Corp in 1962. But in the 1980s controls weakened, and ambitious local barons
threatened to pull the group apart. The centre had to reassert itself: a
period of retrenchment followed during the mid-1980s, with sell-offs and
staff cuts.
The change was also cultural: the company traditionally had strong links
with the establishment and its pillars, like Barclays Bank. The change
brought greater toughness and independence, and a clearer sense of its
objectives.
RTZ got back into shape just in time to pull off the coup that finally
propelled it to the top of the mining league: the 1989 acquisition of most
of the mining and minerals operations of British Petroleum. This Dollars
3.7bn deal almost doubled RTZ's size and brought it several additional
businesses, including Kennecott, the owner of Bingham Canyon in Utah, one of
the world's largest copper mines.
Today, RTZ mines virtually all the leading industrial and precious metals,
including 7 per cent of the world's copper, and a wide range of minerals. It
is the world's largest producer of several commodities including boron, a
versatile mineral used in a variety of industries from glassmaking and power
transformers to fertilisers and detergents. RTZ's Borax mine in the Mojave
desert outside Los Angeles shares the entire world market for boron with
only one other producer, in Turkey.
Geographically, RTZ operates in most corners of the globe. Half its business
is in North America. It owns 30 per cent of Escondida, Chile's newest copper
mine, and 49 per cent of CRA, the large Australian mining concern. Other
countries with an important RTZ presence include South Africa, Namibia,
Portugal and France.
RTZ's corporate philosophy is driven by its belief that success in a
commodity business such as metals depends almost entirely on an ability to
produce the goods more cheaply than anyone else. Provided the quality is
right, other attributes such as marketing are secondary, because buyers will
automatically go for the lowest price.
RTZ has therefore concentrated on building up a portfolio of high-quality,
low-cost mines containing world-class deposits that can withstand the
bucking of the commodity markets. Although it prefers to have overall
control, RTZ is willing to take part shares in exceptional mines, such as
Escondida. This serves a special purpose in the tightly circumscribed mining
business: every deposit you control is one fewer for your competitors.
Like most mining concerns, RTZ has a corporate culture shaped by the
earthiness of the business, and the long-time horizons needed to open up and
exploit mines. There is a strong resistance, for example, to the urge to
speculate. Mr Bob Adams, head of planning and strategy, says: 'If people say
to us 'what are you hot on?', we say we don't know. No one's clever enough
to pick winners. What we do know is that if we're in the best mines in any
commodity, we have a good profit base.'
There is also a reluctance to go downstream and get involved in smelting and
refining more than necessary. 'We are in mining. It's all we're interested
in,' says Sir Derek.
In fact, Sir Derek's comment is more a wish than a reality. If RTZ has a
flaw, it is Pillar, an aluminium fabricating company acquired as part of an
earlier diversification. Pillar has been badly hit by the recession and is
believed to be up for sale, though RTZ will not confirm this officially.
The wariness of speculation extends to the futures and currency markets, and
even interest rates. When RTZ bought the BP business, it financed the deal
with fixed-rate money, contrary to its usual policy of going for floating
rates. This proved expensive, because rates subsequently fell and RTZ ended
up with a much larger interest bill than necessary. Mr Bob Wilson, the chief
executive, says the company acted the way it did, not because it took a view
on the market 'but because we felt we could not afford to expose the company
to a rise in interest rates'.
RTZ could take one simple step to reduce its currency exposure: relocate to
the US. But there is an ingrained resistance even to discussing this idea,
since that might imply it was an option. Sir Derek says: 'Eighty eight per
cent of our shareholder base is in the UK, and we want to stay close. We do
think that being British is helpful. There's an image of fair play, of
cultural skills. That's not meant to sound denigrating to other countries.'
RTZ's strongest protection against market fluctuations is its sheer size.
Although its heavy dependence on copper means that a 10 cent fall in the
price knocks Pounds 53m off profits, the chances are that some other metal
will be rising at the same time. Even so, the overall weakness of the
commodity markets, which has seen metals prices fall on average 30 per cent
over the past three years, has put a severe strain on the company's profits.
From a pre-tax peak of Pounds 1.3bn in 1989, they fell to Pounds 537m last
year.
The company has also shown that size can be useful in mobilising resources
for acquisitions and project developments. Having only just digested the BP
deal, the company recently paid Dollars 470m for a large, open-cast coal
operation in Wyoming, which has added a further facet to the business. (But
RTZ will not be bidding for British Coal because it does not fit RTZ's
low-cost, world-class formula.)
RTZ's dominance of the mining business has a strong influence on the
behaviour of its competitors. In the US, Cyprus Minerals and Amax are about
to merge to form a Dollars 5bn mining company, in a move widely seen as a
bid for greater size and muscle. Mr Allen Born, the chairman of Amax, says:
'RTZ has always been well run. Its size enables it to balance different
commodities.' Even so, Cyprus Amax will only be half as big as RTZ.
But size also has its drawbacks. One is conspicuousness, which RTZ deals
with by being deliberately low key, and paying close attention to sensitive
matters such as the environment and relations with host governments. Green
pressures are now intense (one environmental lobby group, the London-based
Partizans, was formed specifically to watch RTZ). The company tries to deal
with them by setting common standards for the group, and anticipating the
regulators. 'If you act responsibly, you're wanted,' says Sir Derek.
Another drawback is vulnerability to the charge of monopolistic behaviour in
an industry where markets are easily cornered. RTZ is cautious about the way
it prices boron, for example, to avoid anti-trust action. 'Breaking the
company up would be a great pity,' says Sir Derek. 'You've got to have clout
to succeed in this business, clout with bankers and governments.'
Although the gradual consolidation of RTZ's competitors means the pressures
are rising, it is still the leader in the field, which means that much of
the drive has to come from self-discipline. Mr Wilson, the chief executive,
says: 'We have to guard against thinking the job is done. The object is not
to think we're the best, but to be the best in five or 10 years.'

FT  11 AUG 93 / Leading Article: Mr Zhu's risk and reward
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IN 1989, with the tanks in Tiananmen Square and conservative communists
overseeing economic retrenchment after a bout of reform, the world swung
suddenly from tremulous optimism about China's prospects to deepest gloom.
The darkness which was beginning to lift from the Soviet bloc seemed
destined to envelop China indefinitely. On the economic front, these fears
soon proved unjustified: reforms resumed. In viewing the authorities'
present attempts to slow the resulting upswing, those who have been in awe
of China's economic miracle should not again lurch towards unwarranted
pessimism.
To be sure, the future is uncertain and, for many Chinese, not so bright.
The government continues to trample without qualm on the rights of its
citizens. There is increasing unhappiness among the 900m-strong rural
population. Any senior figure's grip on power must be regarded as tenuous
given the turmoil which could follow the death of Mr Deng Xiaoping.
However, there is an essential difference between the austerity measures of
1988-89 and the present: this time the economic reformers, not the
hard-liners, are in charge. Mr Zhu Rongji, chief executor of economic
reform, is both senior vice premier in charge of the economy and governor of
the central bank. His future depends on his ability to prevent a chaotic
hard landing for the economy. This means facing down both provincial bosses
who must curb ambitions for growth, and powerful people within the Communist
party who have lined their pockets in the good times. But it does not mean
wresting back control over the whole economy and reverting to central
planning.
The control which Mr Zhu needs to regain is - although on a larger scale and
with bigger obstacles than is normal - that which any government with an
overheated economy should seek: to rein in the money supply, inflation and
government spending. Reports suggests he is fierce in pursuit of his task,
accusing officials of providing false statistics and interrogating them
about sources of funds for development plans. He has cut off funds which
were fuelling speculation and clamped down on excesses such as golf courses
and luxury villas. The property, construction and steel sectors have felt
the effects.
Mr Zhu's main focus is rightly on the financial system, which has been
haemorrhaging money, partly because of the structural inadequacies of
state-owned banks and partly through corrupt lending. This will give him the
opportunity to impose more market-oriented disciplines on banks, an area
which had received little attention thus far.
Inevitably, there is much pain to come as Mr Zhu's measures take hold. But
success would mean that the swings between booms and busts at home, and
euphoria and gloom abroad, would become less violent. Even if some reforms,
such as of prices, are delayed, he would have smoothed the path of economic
change which is the brightest hope for China's future.

FT  11 AUG 93 / Observer: Mrs T turns ugly
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The vast majority of cases brought to the attentions of the Pensions
Ombudsman are those of the genuinely aggrieved. But not all. Take the case
of Mrs T, a widower, summarised in the annual report.
Mrs T had complained about the inordinate time the trustees of her late
husband's scheme took to pay her widow's benefit and the fact that her
letters went unanswered. But on closer examination it emerged that she had
neglected to tell the trustees her husband had died and had sent 14 letters
of complaint to the wrong address.
Undeterred, the pensions manager sought to make amends, inviting her to the
pensioner's annual Christmas party and arranging her transport. 'Mrs T
repaid these kindnesses by throwing her portion of Christmas pudding and
custard at him,' the report notes soberly.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Is Sir James Goldsmith's family more important than the Rothschilds? This
seems to be the sub-text to the news that the billionaire financier has
commissioned Anthony Allfrey, a retired political consultant, to pen a
history of the Goldsmith dynasty.
Allfrey, whose book on King Edward VII and his Jewish Court was well
reviewed, admits that Sir James is paying for the research but says that he
has been given an entirely free hand to investigate a family which stretches
back over 500 years. Since there are already two biographies of Sir James
himself, Allfrey's patron will not merit much attention. Even so, it
promises to be an upbeat work. 'There are bound to be bad apples in any
barrel,' says Allfrey, 'but I haven't found any.'
It sounds like an ego trip but then the Goldsmiths are not alone. The
Warburgs, for example, might be new boys on the block but they were upset by
Jacques Attali's portrayal of their affairs, and have bent over backwards to
help Ron Chernow, award-winning author of The House of Morgan, with a more
sympathetic book on the Warburg dynasty.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Whatever else you do, don't shoot the monkeys. This is the lesson of a
diplomatic incident in Malaysia after the US and its allies cracked down on
a band of monkeys which had been disrupting US embassy garden parties.
The US diplomat, charged with restraining the invaders, had
counter-attacked, first with catapults, and then sprays, but to no avail.
The situation started to turn really ugly when the monkeys began chasing the
hapless envoy round his own garden. Finally the local wildlife officers had
to be called in and very soon there were 19 dead monkeys.
The local media, which tends to mirror the generally anti-US views of
Malaysian prime minister, Dr Mahathir Mohamad, was incensed by the
escalation in hostilities. Why, thundered an editorial in one local paper,
had the wildlife officers allowed themselves to be cajoled into doing the
dirty work of foreigners?
The monkeys were playful, amorous creatures. It was barbaric to shoot them.
The paper suggested that the foreigners, rather than the monkeys, should be
rounded up and shot. The US ambassador is said to be swinging from the trees
in rage over the whole incident.

Forget the currency crises, General Motors' tiff with Volkswagen, or the

institute is whether long red-lacquered fingernails are sexy.
Based on the opinion of 63 per cent of those questioned, the answer is no.
This might seem surprising, at first sight, but may be explained by the fact
that red nails are seen as a tell-tale sign of lethargy, laziness, boredom,

Not the sort of things self-respecting Germans want to be associated with,
least of all in these straightened times.

FT  11 AUG 93 / Observer: How green is Wanless?
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
If the government wanted a financial man to take over the chairmanship of
the Advisory Committee on Business and the Environment, Derek Wanless was
the obvious choice. He has claimed for NatWest, which he runs, the title of
Britain's greenest bank, and aged only 46 he might almost be said to belong
to the environmental generation.
Wanless recently put his name to NatWest's environmental audit, the first by
a UK clearing bank, and last year he was one of the moving forces behind the
UN's declaration on banks and the environment. NatWest's annual report is
printed on paper from 'sustainably managed resources' and the postal wrapper
is 'UV light degradable.'
But will Wanless have the time and vision to fulfill his new role? He has
only been running NatWest for 16 months, and it is still recovering from its
financial woes. His environmental audit revealed as great a preoccupation
with saving envelopes and switching off lights as it did with the great
ecological issues of the day.
'Environmental sense, business sense' is Wanless' watchword. The government
will be looking for something rather more instructive than that from its
'green chip' businessmen. As for the investment community, there will be a
worry that Wanless's enthusiasm for fashionable extra-curricular activities
suggests another sort of greenness. Chairing government quangos is normally
a job for elderly bank chairmen, not young bank chief executives.

Tyne Tees Cash and Carry, based in a converted telecommunications factory in
Middlesbrough, has prospered during the recession by selling cheap, basic
foods to small retailers. Mr Munir Ahmad, one of three brothers who run the
Pounds 59m-turnover company, is confident of expansion, despite the uneven
pace of recovery in the UK economy.
On the other side of England, Warwick Fabrics, a textiles company with 20
employees in Bourton-on-the-Water, Gloucestershire, spreads its Pounds 4m
annual sales over 45 countries. In the past six months, it has increased
staff by a third. Mr Cameron Warwick, sales director, says: 'We're young,
enthusiastic and aggressive.'
In the East Midlands, Mr Geoff Duck, managing director of specialist
engineering group Loughborough Sound Images, says 'things couldn't be
better' after the company's 40 per cent growth last year based on sales to
big electronics groups such as Motorola and GEC.
These anecdotes illustrate the optimism among many small businesses as
Britain enters what the Bank of England yesterday called a 'gradual
recovery'.
Small companies - those with fewer than 200 employees - have been worse
affected than big ones during the poor economic climate of the past three
years, both in terms of falling output and in the number of business
failures. But a survey last week from the Confederation of British Industry
says that the small manufacturers which have survived are more likely than
larger groups to increase staff and investment in the next few months.
A similar message came from another survey last month of nearly 9,000
companies in both manufacturing and services conducted by the British
Chambers of Commerce. It said small companies - which account for roughly
three-quarters of the UK workforce - had increased their staff in the second
quarter, while bigger groups continued to reduce employees.
In the case of those small British businesses which are prospering, their
relative success can be explained largely by the following factors:
value-for-money products or services that suit recession-hit customers;
bias towards exports, which have been an important factor behind recent UK
growth, helped by the depreciation in sterling following Britain's exit from
the European exchange rate mechanism, and the consequent fall in interest
rates;
specialist activities directed towards big companies, which have shed staff
during the recession and have become more dependent on subcontracting;
eagerness of staff to show a flexible approach to work, partly because they
fear unemployment which, in spite of the recent five-month drop of 83,100,
remains high at 2.91m;
enthusiasm from the people in charge of the companies, who often own a
majority stake and so have a strong financial incentive to see their
businesses do well.
One company exhibiting several of these characteristics is Dunphy
Combustion, a family-owned maker of low-pollution burners for boilers and
central heating equipment, based in Rochdale, Lancashire. It has grown
rapidly in the past three years, exporting 95 per cent of its products.
Mr Malcolm Dunphy, who set up the company 29 years ago, gives his sales
staff twice-weekly German lessons to help them in continental markets. He
has also started building what will be a Pounds 1m research centre 'to turn
Rochdale into the Silicon Valley for environmental technology'. He says UK
manufacturers 'are so used to thinking they are inferior, they don't
appreciate the export opportunities'. His company is budgeting for a 50 per
cent increase in turnover this year, mainly on the back of orders from
Germany for central heating equipment.
Even though the evidence from small companies such as Dunphy points to
better times ahead for the sector, the CBI and chambers of commerce surveys
underline the fact that big, rather than small, companies have been in the
lead in pushing up output in the first half of the year.
Mr Richard Brown, deputy director-general of the chambers of commerce,
explains that, in the early phase of recovery, bigger groups would be
expected to increase orders and output faster than their smaller
counterparts. This is because their greater resources, in terms of
production lines and marketing staff, can be activated more easily on signs
of higher demand.
But he is cheered by signs of higher recruitment by small companies. 'The
opportunities for a sustained recovery very much depend on the small
business sector,' says Mr Brown.
Even so, the sector as a whole is a long way from being pronounced healthy.
Bankruptcies among small traders totalled 21,678 in the first half of this
year, up 12.5 per cent on the same period last year, according to
business-information company Dun &amp; Bradstreet.
Yet the rate of formation of small companies is high. According to the
chambers of commerce, precise figures for new business starts are hard to
come by. It says that as a rough rule, about 10 per cent of the 2m or so
small businesses collapsed each year during the recession, only to be
replaced by new ones at about the same rate. More recent evidence is that
company starts may be increasing. Jordans, which specialises in analysing
business start-ups based on registrations from Companies House, says in the
first six months of the year, 55,567 companies were started. This was 5.5
per cent up on the first half of 1992 and the first rise since the recession
began about three years ago.
Mr Stephen Alambritis of the 58,000-member Federation of Small Businesses,
says positive factors helping the sector include brighter economic prospects
and signs of greater financial support by the banks.
Although small companies continue to complain about the difficulties of
increasing their overdrafts and getting new loans, the banks say they do
have money to lend and that bad debts are now less of a problem.
National Westminster Bank, which claims to handle the accounts of 30 per
cent of new small businesses, says that the outlook for the sector is
'cautiously optimistic', with its own figures indicating that start-ups so
far this year are slightly higher than in the second half of last year.
Illustrating the generally brighter prospects for the sector,
Manchester-based Mother Hubbard Cakes, which started in 1979 and makes cakes
for supermarkets such as Asda and Kwik-Save, is operating its second-hand
cake plant 24 hours a day. It has expanded to annual sales of Pounds 2.5m
and taken on a third of its 90 staff in the past year.
'We can take out 25 per cent of our competitors' costs, for example by
cutting down on packaging, and still make an adequate margin,' boasts Mr
Philip Wilson, managing director.
Another who claims the recession has helped is Mr Gus Coulton, who started
London-based McBride's Design Consultants alone in 1989, and now employs 10
people. He undercuts bigger rivals because his employees each do a range of
jobs from design work to chasing up invoices.
But can the generally good progress of these small companies last?
A large part of the answer depends on the overall economic climate and
confidence levels among consumers and big companies. Figures out this week
showed a new willingness among consumers to borrow with total consumer
credit rising in June by Pounds 213m, the highest monthly figure for two
years. Meanwhile, many large companies are confident that their output may
rise slightly over the next year.
Assuming further reductions in interest rates across Europe, which will help
export demand, a continuation of better conditions for obtaining bank
finance and no further hiccups in the UK recovery, the conditions for a
small business revival seem to be in place.
