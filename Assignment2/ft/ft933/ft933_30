FT  05 AUG 93 / Electricity price controls accepted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALL 12 regional electricity companies in England and Wales have accepted a
new set of price controls which provide incentives for energy saving in
their supply businesses, Michael Smith writes.
Offer, the industry regulator which proposed the revised regime, said
yesterday that the controls will also require companies to make and pass on
further efficiency gains to customers. Acceptance of controls covering the
supply businesses clears the way for talks on how the more lucrative
distribution arms of the businesses should be regulated.
The supply businesses, which buy power from the generators, account for
about 10 per cent of the regional companies' profits. From next April
revenue rises will be limited to the rate of inflation minus 2 per cent. At
present the companies can raise prices in line with inflation.

FT  05 AUG 93 / Salvation Army probe widens
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
FRAUD SQUAD detectives have flown to Luxembourg as part of a continuing
investigation into a Pounds 6.2m alleged fraud against the Salvation Army,
the world's largest voluntary organisation.
Detectives are understood to be seeking details of Pounds 4m missing from
the charity's funds which were supposed to be frozen in a Luxembourg bank
account.
It is thought that the police investigation has made little progress since
it arrested and subsequently bailed Mr Stuart Ford, a Birmingham businessman
alleged, in a civil action brought by the Salvation Army, to be at the
centre of the fraud. Mr Ford denies any wrongdoing.
The Salvation Army said yesterday that it remained determined to do
everything possible to recover the missing funds, but was in the meantime
being forced to reorganise its internal funding arrangements to deal with
the anticipated shortfall in its accounts.
Profits generated by Reliance, the Salvation Army in-house bank, by Sagic,
the charity's insurance arm, and by Salvation Army Publishing and Supplies,
are to be used more directly in supporting social projects.
The reorganisation of the charity's internal funding arrangements was
ordered by the Salvation Army's board of trustees, which is chaired by
Commissioner Dinsdale Pender.
The Charity Commission meanwhile said that it was continuing its
investigation of the affair, although the Salvation Army believes a final
report will not be ready until early next year.
In April the charity dismissed one of its top officials, and moved three
others to new jobs at the end of its own internal investigation into the
alleged fraud. It said there was no suspicion of dishonesty by any of the
disciplined people.

FT  05 AUG 93 / OFT wants credit trade deregulated
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM KING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SUBSTANTIAL deregulation of the marketing of consumer credit is suggested by
the Office of Fair Trading in a discussion document published yesterday.
The OFT also suggests deregulating credit agreements and lifting some of the
criminal law's sanctions against the credit industry. The document is part
of the OFT's review of the 1974 Consumer Credit Act, requested by the
Department of Trade and Industry under the government's deregulation
initiative.
Mr John Mills, OFT director of consumer affairs, said yesterday that he
wanted to explore the scope for greater self-regulation by the credit
industry.
The Consumers' Association expressed concern over the proposals 'given the
track record of self-regulation' in the financial services sector.
The OFT stresses that protection of consumers is paramount but says that the
act and its regulations - which govern credit agreements up to Pounds 15,000
 -might be imposing greater burdens on providers of credit than are
necessary for effective consumer protection.
It says the current system of licensing credit providers is not up for
review, but the OFT is considering setting tougher conditions for the
granting and retaining of licences, while relaxing detailed regulations.
The discussion document invites comment on specific areas where the OFT
believes regulations might be cut.
It has asked for comment on whether the detailed regulations on credit
advertising deliver high standards in practice and suggests that credit
advertisements could be subject to self-regulation by the Advertising
Standards Authority or a similar body.
The OFT also questions the effectiveness of 'health warnings' in credit
advertisements - such as the requirement for mortgage adverts to warn of the
danger of loss of the home if payments are not kept up.
It invites local authorities and trading standards officers to estimate the
cost of enforcing the credit act and asks whether criminal sanctions are the
appropriate way of enforcing the rules.
The OFT says deregulation would reduce costs for the lending organisations.
The Consumers' Association said the OFT's thinking was weighted too heavily
in favour of lenders.
Ms Jean Eaglesham, head of money policy at the association, said: 'All our
research and evidence suggests that much tighter control of marketing is
needed.'
She added that the OFT was wrong to rely on the licensing system which is
not an effective policing mechanism.
The Consumer Credit Act prescribes a range of monetary limits for which the
act's provisions apply. The OFT suggests that the limits - which were last
revised in 1982 - should be reviewed so that the act applies to credit
agreements up to Pounds 30,000.
Lending and hiring to business customers is not discussed in the
consultation document, although the government's deregulation task forces
have suggested removing such agreements from the act. The OFT has advised
the government against such a course and plans to publish a discussion
document in the autumn on the treatment of business customers under the act.
The deadline for responses to the document is October 20. Public hearings
will be held in London on October 27-28 and in Leeds on November 2.

THE AVERAGE household's expenditure rose by nearly pounds 15 a week last
year in spite of the recession, according to the government's Family
Expenditure Survey.
Average weekly expenditure in 1992 was pounds 271.80, compared with pounds
256.90 in 1991. The average gross household income was pounds 342.90 per
week, compared with pounds 338.20 a year earlier.
Housing and food were the biggest items of expenditure, each accounting for
more than pounds 47 per week.

FT  05 AUG 93 / Howard announces plans to ease betting shop curbs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HIGH STREET betting shops are to be given a facelift under government
proposals published yesterday.
Bookmakers will be allowed window displays featuring top bets and television
sets showing racing and other sports action.
Inside the shops they will be allowed to increase the size of TV screens and
provide more light refreshments. The ban on alcohol will con-tinue.
Present regulations require that windows must be obscured to prevent
passers-by catching a glimpse of tele-vised horse-races and bet-ting shows.
Mr Michael Howard, home secretary, launching a consultative paper yesterday
on the relaxation of the restrictions, said: 'The veil over betting shops
could soon be lifted. The changes would make betting offices a more visible
part of the high street scene and enable bookmakers to provide additional
information about their business.'
Mr Howard said the intention was to give con-sumers more freedom while
ensuring fair and honest betting. He said: 'Care would be taken to ensure
that these changes do not result in betting shops becoming general
entertainment centres.'
The moves, which follow the easing of restrictions on evening opening
earlier this year, were welcomed by the industry.
Mr Kelvin Stacey, marketing director of Coral, said: 'We have been
up-grading our shops for some time and these changes will enable us to move
further forward. They would put us on a normal retail footing.'
Mr John Brown, managing director of William Hill, said: 'Now we can show
betting shops are no longer smoky dens.'

FT  05 AUG 93 / Clinton edges closer to budget win
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROGER MATTHEWS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton came a step closer to winning congressional approval
for his deficit-reduction budget last night when a senator who had
previously voted against the bill announced he was switching sides.
Senator Dennis DeConcini of Arizona, who has been under intense pressure
from Democratic leaders all week, said he would vote to approve the
compromise budget. 'This bill will mean jobs, and overall I think it is a
positive thing for the country and for the economy,' he said.
When the bill first passed the Senate it was tied at 49-49 and was only
approved on the casting vote of Vice-President Al Gore. Since then one
senator who voted Yes has announced he can no longer support the bill,
leaving Mr Clinton one vote short, assuming no other senators change sides.
Mr Gore said yesterday he did not know whether he would be required to
decide the fate of the legislation again tomorrow. 'But one way or another,
this bill is going through.'
Earlier, Mr Clinton had taken the battle to win approval for his budget
proposals to Capitol Hill, declaring: 'I do not think the Senate will let
this plan go down. I do not think they will do that to the country.'
The House of Representatives is due to vote on the budget package today,
with the more finely balanced Senate vote due on Friday. Under the
compromise worked out by Congress the budget deficit will be reduced by
Dollars 496bn (Pounds 332.8bn) over the next five years, achieved by raising
more than Dollars 243bn in new taxes and cutting about Dollars 253bn in
spending.
To blunt Republican criticism that higher income tax charges for the
country's top earners were being made retroactive to January 1, a Treasury
official said yesterday the back payments could be made in three tranches.
The concession, which has been written into the amended bill, would allow
the additional amounts for the current fiscal year to be paid on April 15
next year and on the same date in the two succeeding years.
Mr Bob Dole, Republican leader in the Senate, has accused the administration
of imposing the biggest tax increase in history. Opinion polls underline the
difficulty Democrats will have in persuading the public that the new tax
charges are fair; according to a USA Today/CNN/Gallup poll, about 68 per
cent of respondents believed middle-income taxpayers would shoulder the
burden.

FT  05 AUG 93 / President at mercy of his own party: Policy ambitions of the
White House hang by a thread
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROGER MATTHEWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT is the biggest budget deficit reduction package in the history of the US.
Better than that, it is the biggest budget deficit reduction ever, anywhere
in the world. With such extravagant claims, members of the Clinton
administration and senior Democrats have launched their last-ditch campaign
to win congressional approval for the president's amended budget proposals.
Rejection could seriously undermine the authority of the White House for the
next three and a half years. Not that anyone around President Bill Clinton
is talking of defeat, despite the closeness of the votes expected in both
the House of Representatives and the Senate in the next two days.
What is promised instead is a change in national direction, a new momentum
and an end to the gridlock which for the past 12 years has seen president
and Congress locked in almost perpetual conflict.
'There are only two choices,' Mr Clinton told the country in a nationwide
television address on Tuesday night. 'Our plan, or no plan'. However, the
plan to which the president was referring is not quite the same as the one
he offered nearly six months ago.
Last February the president was also promising an economic stimulus through
a Dollars 30bn two-year spending plan, only to see it killed by a Republican
filibuster. He wanted to impose a wide-ranging energy tax that would have
raised some Dollars 71.5bn over five years, only to see that emerge from
Congress as a modest 4.3 cents a gallon increase in the tax on petrol. This
will achieve little more than one-third of the original target.
But what remains is enough for Mr Clinton to claim that he is within Dollars
4bn of the Dollars 500bn he set himself to cut from the expected budget
deficit over the next five years, and enough for the Republicans in Congress
to vote en masse against the compromise package which emerged from the
conference committee on Tuesday.
Senator Bob Dole, leader of the Republican minority in the Senate, described
the package as 'the largest tax increase in the history of the world'.
Little touches Americans more fundamentally than the threat of higher tax
and the thrust of the Democrats' campaign is to demonstrate that the
administration's direct tax proposals affect only a small proportion of the
population. 'At least 80 per cent of of the new tax burden will fall on
those making more than Dollars 200,000 a year and very little on other
Americans,' said Mr Clinton.
Those primarily affected are individuals with a gross income of Dollars
140,000 a year and couples jointly earning more than Dollars 180,000. For
them the top tax rate goes up from 31 to 36 per cent, with a top marginal
rate of 39.6 per cent for those with taxable incomes above Dollars 250,000.
'For working families making less than Dollars 180,000 a year there will be
no income tax increase,' he said.
Mr Clinton's message is directed primarily at fellow Democrats because it is
within the president's own party that the battle will be lost or won. When
the budget bill originally passed the House of Representatives, it did so
with a six-vote majority, 219-213. But in the Senate the vote was tied 49-49
and only the casting vote of Vice-President Al Gore allowed it to progress.
Six Democrat senators voted against and since then one more has announced
his intention of voting against.
On the perhaps optimistic assumption that there will be no more defectors in
the Senate, it means that at least one more Yes vote is required to see Mr
Clinton safely home in the scheduled vote tomorrow.
That may have been achieved last night when Senator Dennis DeConcini of
Arizona said he would now back the legislation, apparently persuaded by
compromises struck during the conference stage of the bill.
Mr DeConcini, well known for his last-minute bargaining, had admitted that
sentiment in his home state was generally against the Clinton package,
although he is a strong advocate of measures to reduce the deficit.
He had claimed that he wanted to be sure that all the new tax revenue went
towards achieving that aim - something Mr Clinton's pledge to establish a
special trust fund for the purpose may answer.
The senator had also said he was worried about higher petrol prices and the
effect, especially on older people, of the increase in the taxable portion
of social security benefits.
Ultimately, the decision of Democrat waverers will rest on their perception
of what the public, particularly the middle classes, believes the Clinton
package will achieve: whether it provides what the president promised - an
economic stimulus, tax fairness and a reduction in the deficit; or whether
it has been reduced primarily to a tax-raising budget which, as the
Republicans claim, hits the middle classes hardest and will kill jobs, not
create them.
But, as the president told the nation, it is the only plan on offer and the
basis for everything else he wants to achieve, such as improved healthcare,
welfare reform, and the modernisation of government. If his own party votes
him down, the damage would be immense.

Cuba's government replaced four ministers yesterday in a shake-up of key
economic posts that signalled its determination to confront the island's
economic crisis with reforms, Reuter reports from Havana.
The ruling council of state, headed by President Fidel Castro, named Mr
Alfredo Jordan Morales, Mr Nelson Torres Perez, General Silvano Colas
Sanchez and Mr Jose Luis Rodriguez Garca as the new ministers for
agriculture, sugar, communications and finance respectively.
It was the most important shake-up of economic posts on the Caribbean island
for several years. Diplomats said the changes confirmed President Castro's
intention to tackle the island's economic problems.

President Patricio Aylwin has attempted to close a chapter of Chilean
history by speeding up the trials of officials accused of human rights
abuses under the previous military government of General Augusto Pinochet,
writes David Pilling in Santiago.
In an eagerly awaited national address on Tuesday night, Mr Aylwin proposed
the appointment of special judges who would be given the responsibility of
rapidly processing the trials, which have become bogged down in the legal
system.
Judges would hear evidence in secret in an attempt to learn the truth
quickly and, where possible, to discover the whereabouts of missing bodies,
the prime concern of most victims' families. There are more than 2,000 cases
of extra-judicial killings and disappearances, most of them brought to light
in a 1991 report commissioned by the government. A 1978 amnesty law
precludes punishment of abuses committed between 1973 and 1978 - the
bloodiest period of the Pinochet regime.

Economic activity in the US continued to expand slowly to moderately in June
and the first half of July and was not threatened by Midwest flooding,
according to US Federal Reserve banks, Reuter reports from Washington.
In their Beige Book report, the banks said 'flooding inflicted considerable
damage in parts of the Chicago, St Louis, Kansas City and Minneapolis
districts, but the effects were said to be highly concentrated and were not
seen to threaten overall economic expansion in any district'.
The report, which is produced about every six weeks, was based on surveys of
business executives conducted before July 27 by the 12 component banks of
the US central bank.
Midwest flooding, which is being called one of the worst natural
catastrophes in US history, has killed 45 people and caused an estimated
Dollars 10bn in damage.

TWO police officers convicted of violating the civil rights of Mr Rodney
King, a black motorist whose beating in 1991 by the men was captured on
videotape, were sentenced to 30 months' imprisonment yesterday, Reuter
reports from Los Angeles.
District Judge John Davies imposed the prison terms on Sergeant Stacey Koon
and Officer Laurence Powell after nearly four hours of arguments by
prosecutors and defence lawyers. Koon, who directed the beating, and Powell,
who delivered most of the baton blows, could have received prison terms of
up to 10 years. The judge said he chose a lesser sentence because of the
resistance put up by Mr King during his arrest and the negative impact on
the police officers' lives from the notoriety of the case.
The acquittal of the two men, and two other police officers, on most charges
in a state court in April, 1992, sparked three days of rioting in Los
Angeles.

FT  05 AUG 93 / World Trade News: Russia's eastern ports enjoy an
embarrassment of riches - But traders suffer from the congestion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH FRASER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RUSSIA'S newly privatised Far Eastern trade ports have found themselves in
an enviable position: they have far more customers than they can handle.
Three ports facing the Sea of Japan hold the key to Russia's trade with the
Far East. However, each is able to handle a maximum of 11m tonnes of cargo a
year, putting a ceiling on that trade.
The privatisation of Vladivostok's trade port was completed in April. The
nearby ports of Nakhodka and Vostochnyy went private last year.
Privatisation has not, however, increased competition. 'If a customer says
they can get a better deal at Nakhodka, we can say, 'Take your business and
go to Nakhodka,' because we know that there are five more companies waiting
to do business with us,' says Mr Sergei Movchan, commercial director of
Teko, a cargo agent linked to the port of Vladivostok.
Teko's main line of business is forwarding metals to Japan, South Korea,
Vietnam and other countries. Its terms include payment in advance, usually
in hard currency, even for Russian customers used to paying in roubles.
Mr Movchan estimates that about 80 per cent of imports through Vladivostok
are financed by private businessmen bringing in consumer goods. He is also
seeing an increasing number of new businessmen buying up export quotas for
raw materials, including metals, timber, and minerals.
The role of the ministry of transport, which ruled the old Soviet transport
system with an iron grip, has been diminished since privatisation, not
always with entirely positive results.
Some new businessmen, not yet used to the new system, load goods onto the
Trans-Siberian Express without reaching prior agreement with the ports, says
Mr Movchan. Last summer there were 7,000 train wagons waiting to be unloaded
at Vladivostok.
The ports put the blame for the bottlenecks firmly at the door of the
businessmen and the railway. 'We did not pay one dollar or one rouble in
fines for delays last year. All the hold-ups are on the railroad waiting to
get into the port,' says Mr Mikhail Robkanov, president of Vladivostok
Commercial Port Corporation.
Some of the bitterest complaints come from Russia's largest trade fleet, The
Far Eastern Shipping Company (Fesco).
'It is a matter of principle,' that the ports should not be privatised.
Practically nowhere in the civilised or so-called capitalist world are ports
in private hands,' claims Mr George Pikus, vice president of Fesco.
'When we negotiate with the ports, it is one monopoly talking to another,
but they are bigger monopolists than we are,' says Mr Pikus.
But Mr Gennady Zhebelev, general manager of the merchant port of Vostochnyy,
claims that competition for high quality customers is starting. Vostochnyy
has poached exporting clients from Nakhodka, including a logging complex
from Irkutsk. Among other projects, Vostochnyy has a Dollars 100m credit
from Deutsche Bank to build a fertiliser handling complex.
But even at Vostochnyy, the region's largest and most modern trade port,
bottlenecks are not unknown. In January, 1,500 wagons arrived carrying coal
from Siberia. The coals had frozen and the port equipment could not unload
them. Equipment was not available to move the wagons off the track, and
trains queued up behind.
Solutions to these problems may lie in western technology and management
skills. For the past three years, Sea-Land, the giant US transportation
company, has been operating a joint venture with the Russian ministry of

FT  05 AUG 93 / World Trade News: Scottish shipyard wins court reprieve
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FERGUSON Shipbuilders, a Scottish shipyard, has been granted an interim
order in the Jerusalem high court which may help it win a Pounds 10m
contract to build two tugs for state-owned Israel Electric.
The court instructed Mr Israel Kessar, minister of transport, not to award a
contract for the tugs to state-owned Israel Shipyards or any other company.
The order also applies to Israel Electric and the port of Hadera, where the
tugs would operate.
Ferguson, which is based at Port Glasgow on the lower Clyde, believes its
tender for the contract to build the tugs was 23 per cent lower than the
Dollars 16.7m (Pounds 11.2m) bid by Israel Shipyards.
About 14 shipyards initially submitted tenders.
Mr Kessar had told the Israeli press he intended to grant the contract to
Israel Shipyards to protect domestic jobs. His intentions were said to have
been criticised by officials at the ministry of finance and at Israel
Electric.
Ferguson is understood to have felt it had been used as a price marker in an
expensive and time-consuming charade.
Judge Michael Cheshin gave Mr Kessar 10 days to respond to the order.
The issue will be considered by three judges in the Israeli Supreme Court,
probably within a few weeks.
Ferguson, a privately owned company purchased from British Shipbuilders in
1989, builds specialised small ships such as ferries, dredgers, research
vessels and tugs. It has been owned since early 1991 by a consortium chaired
by Sir Ross Belch, who once managed the Scott Lithgow shipyard at Port
Glasgow, now closed.
It is currently constructing two ferries for the Red Funnel line which
operates to the Isle of Wight. Ferguson made pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.04m
on sales of Pounds 16m in 1992. It employs 230 people.

FT  05 AUG 93 / World Trade News: Asian air cargo set to soar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ASIA is likely to experience the fastest growth in air cargo traffic over
the next 17 years, according to a forecast yesterday from Boeing, the
world's biggest aircraft manufacturer, writes Daniel Green. By the year 2010
Asian markets - including links with Europe and North America - would
account for half the total air freight market, Boeing said.
But profit margins for freight operators will continue to decline as larger
aircraft and competition cut costs and prices. Revenue per tonne-kilometre,
the standard unit of measurement in the airline industry, fell 7 per cent in
1992 and will slip by 1 per cent a year on average until 2010. In volume
terms, the world air freight market will grow at an average of 6.8 per cent
a year until 2010.
Cargo will grow far faster than passenger traffic, which Boeing estimates
will increase 5.4 per cent a year over the period.

FT  05 AUG 93 / World Trade News: Honda enlists Stadco in expansion drive -
Components venture expects sales of Y1bn
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
HONDA Engineering, part of the Japanese motor group, has chosen Stadco of
the UK as its partner in a venture to design and make systems for automotive
components manufacture and assembly lines in Europe.
The deal is the first such alliance signed by Stadco, the automotive
pressings and production equipment subsidiary of Hall Engineering
(Holdings). It is an important step in Stadco's strategy to move into the
top tier of European automotive production equipment suppliers.
Honda expects annual sales of Y1bn (Pounds 6.4m) from the alliance, which it
said would extend later to regions such as south-east Asia and Africa. It
forms part of Honda efforts to expand supplies of its engineering equipment
outside the group's own factories.
The link-up is a further boost for Stadco, which in March announced its
first order from a German-owned car company when Volkswagen's Audi unit
signed up for Pounds 21m of vehicle assembly equipment and tooling.
Germany is home to Thyssen and Kuka, two of Europe's leading suppliers of
such machinery.
Mr Alan Mace, Stadco's managing director, said the deal would strengthen the
company through access to Honda's research and development, and technology
for 'lean' manufacturing systems. It would also give Stadco extra
credibility as it sought orders from European car manufacturers.
Access to Honda Engineering's manufacturing capability would allow Stadco to
get its name on bidding lists for larger contracts than was now possible, at
least in the short and medium term, Mr Mace said.
In the UK Stadco has supplied both Honda - last year it installed body
manufacturing equipment at the Japanese company's new Swindon plant - and
Rover Group, in which Honda has a 20 per cent stake.
Stadco's sales have grown from Pounds 11m in 1983 to Pounds 45m-Pounds 50m
in each of the past two years.
It accounts for about a third of Hall, which is best known for its steel
stockholding and construction product interests.

</HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton took the battle to win approval for his budget
proposals to Capitol Hill yesterday, declaring: 'I do not think the Senate
will let this plan go down. I do not think they will do that to the
country.'
The House of Representatives is due to vote on the compromise budget package
today, with the more finely balanced Senate vote due on Friday. Under the
compromise worked out by Congress the budget deficit will be reduced by
Dollars 496bn (Pounds 332.8bn) over the next five years, achieved by raising
more than Dollars 243bn in new taxes and cutting about Dollars 253bn in
spending.
Asked if he would win, the president would only say: 'I hope so'.
Mr Al Gore, the vice-president whose casting vote was needed to get the
original budget bill through the Senate, said yesterday he did not know
whether he would decide the fate of the legislation again tomorrow. 'But one
way or another, this bill is going through,' he added.
To blunt Republican criticism that higher income tax charges for the
country's top earners were being made retroactive to January 1, a Treasury
official said yesterday the back payments could be made in three tranches.
The concession, which has been written into the amended bill, would allow
the additional amounts for the current fiscal year to be paid on April 15
next year and on the same date in the two succeeding years.
Mr Bob Dole, the Republican leader in the Senate, has accused the
administration of imposing the biggest tax increase in history. He also
claims that Mr Clinton and his fellow Democrats are so anxious to get their
hands on the public's money 'that they made the tax increases retroactive. .
. to 20 days before President Clinton got to the White House'.
The latest public opinion polls underline the difficulty faced by the
Democrats in persuading the public that the new income tax charges are fair
and only fall on the highest earners. According to a USA Today/CNN/Gallup
poll, about 68 per cent of respondents believed that middle-income taxpayers
would shoulder most of the additional burden.
Democratic Senator Dennis DeConcini of Arizona, who party leaders are
pressing hard to swing his vote in favour of the legislation, continued to
tantalise yesterday. Having voted previously against the bill, he said he
was still leaning in that direction.

FT  05 AUG 93 / World Trade News: US study defends multinationals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US's failure to improve its trade position with Japan stems from 'the
relative paucity' of its direct investment there, according to a report
released yesterday by the Emergency Committee for American Trade.
Ecat, comprising leaders of about 60 large US corporations, has produced an
updated defence of the contribution US multinationals make to the American
economy.
It asserts that multinationals, rather than exporting jobs, produce exports
which provide the best paid and most secure positions in the US.
The higher the share of US investment in manufacturing facilities abroad,
the more likely it is the US has a merchandise trade surplus with that
country, the Mainstay II report says. Thus, a US worried about imbalances
between it and the rest of the world might be better off pushing for an end
to foreign investment barriers, rather than pursuing invisible and formal
barriers to trade.
After the dollar began to weaken in 1985, US exports rose sharply,
accounting for 89 per cent of economic growth between 1989 and 1991. US
multinationals accounted for about two-thirds of manufactured exports.
'Industries with the highest levels of foreign investment have the highest
rate of exports and export growth,' the report says. The home country gets
remittances from royalties, profits and fees, which in turn create new jobs.
The report rejects the argument that foreign investors produce abroad to
take advantage of low wages and re-export cheap products to the US.
Excluding Canada, only 7.2 per cent of total sales by US manufacturing
affiliates were to the US market in 1990, a percentage largely unchanged in
the last two decades.
The study says the number of multinational jobs declined only 0.5 per cent
from 1982 to 1989 - a quarter of the average decline of the Fortune 500
industrial companies.

SUMITOMO Chemical, the world's largest supplier of high-grade epoxy resins,
is under pressure to turn to Dow Chemical of the US for emergency supplies
following an explosion at its plant in northern Japan last month.
The resulting halt in production has affected the semiconductor industry, as
the plant supplied 60 per cent of the world's epoxy resins used for plastic
semiconductor packages.
Sumitomo initially declined co-operation with Dow after the US company
offered to start up a plant, closed in 1991, on condition Sumitomo purchased
all the epoxy produced over the next five years.
Sumitomo said it had a two-month inventory and would be able to provide
50-60 per cent of its usual monthly sales from September. It added the
Japanese chemical companies Nippon Kayaku and Dainippon Ink and Chemicals,
and Chang Chun Plastics of Taiwan, would provide emergency supplies.
However, Sumitomo may eventually have to meet Dow's conditions to keep up
supplies. Mr Tommy Tang, analyst at Baring Securities in Tokyo, said that
unless Sumitomo could guarantee supplies it might have to reach agreement
with Dow.
The cause of the explosion at the Sumitomo plant is still being
investigated.
The company said it did not know how long restoration would take; the
plant's main equipment and most racks and structures were reusable, although
peripheral equipment, including a solvent recovery tank and an electrical
room, were badly damaged by the blast.
High costs forced Dow to close down its epoxy resins plant, which had a
production capacity of 5,000 tonnes, It could cost more than Dollars 3m
(Pounds 2m) to start up.

<TEXT>
CUBA'S government replaced four ministers yesterday in a shake-up of key
economic posts that signalled its determination to confront the island's
economic crisis with reforms, Reuter reports from Havana.
The ruling council of state, headed by President Fidel Castro, named Mr
Alfredo Jordan Morales, Mr Nelson Torres Perez, General Silvano Colas
Sanchez and Mr Jose Luis Rodriguez Garca as the new ministers for
agriculture, sugar, communications and finance respectively.
It was the most important shake-up of economic posts on the Caribbean island
for several years. Foreign diplomats said the changes confirmed President
Castro's intention to tackle the island's economic problems, aggravated this
year by flagging food production and a disastrous sugar harvest.
Mr Rodriguez, a leading economist, was previously deputy director of the
Centre for Research in the World Economy in Havana. Last week he told
foreign reporters he foresaw the introduction of monetary, tax and exchange
rate policies and limited market mechanisms to overhaul the economy.

FT  05 AUG 93 / Chile to speed Pinochet human rights trials
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID PILLING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SANTIAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Patricio Aylwin has attempted to close a chapter of Chilean
history by speeding up the trials of officials accused of human rights
abuses under the previous military government of General Augusto Pinochet.
In an eagerly awaited national address on Tuesday night, Mr Aylwin proposed
the appointment of special judges who would be given the responsibility of
rapidly processing the trials, which have become bogged down in the legal
system.
Judges would hear evidence in secret in an attempt to learn the truth
quickly and, where possible, to discover the whereabouts of missing bodies,
the prime concern of most victims' families.
There are more than 2,000 recorded cases of extra-judicial killings and
disappearances, most of them brought to light in a 1991 report commissioned
by the government. A 1978 amnesty law precludes punishment of abuses
committed between 1973 and 1978 - the bloodiest period of the Pinochet
regime.
Mr Jaime Castillo Velasco, president of the Human Rights Commission, said
the proposals were 'very important and could produce the desired results'. A
successful outcome, however, rests on the willingness of military officials
 -under the cloak of secrecy - to help unearth fresh evidence.
Mrs Sola Sierra, president of the Association of Families of the
Disappeared, said: 'We are not satisfied. The president's proposal favours
those who violated human rights, belittling the just demands of victims'
families for truth and justice.' Calls from the military and some right-wing
politicians to put a 'full stop' to all trials were rejected by Mr Aylwin as
'morally and legally inadmissible'. To bury the past, he said, would
undermine the painful process of national reconciliation.
The president said his proposal, which will shortly be submitted to
Congress, aimed to put into practice the so-called Aylwin doctrine, namely:
'The whole truth, and justice as far as possible.'
He admitted, however, that his was not a 'perfect solution'.

FT  05 AUG 93 / Jordanian link probed in Iraqi antiques theft
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PART OF a private collection of antiques worth millions of pounds taken from
Kuwait by the Iraqis during their seven-month occupation of the emirate has
turned up at Sotheby's, the international art dealers, in London.
British police who have informed the Foreign Office and other European
colleagues through Interpol, believe the antiques may belong to a collection
of Islamic art looted from the villa in Kuwait City of Mr Yasim Homaizi, a
businessman. European police forces are investigating the possibility that
Jordan may have been used as a diversionary route for the antiques.
Kuwaiti officials said last night that leading members of the Iraqi
government were being forced to try to sell antiques they had stolen on the
international market because of an increasing shortage of hard currency.
According to information reaching Kuwait City, Iraqi soldiers have been
transporting lorry loads of priceless items in recent months to the
Iraqi-Jordanian border where they are handed over to middlemen.
When the Iraqi occupation ended in 1991, the Homaizi collection - containing
manuscripts, carpets, metal work and pottery - was included in an official
claim against Iraq for compensation which was channelled through the United
Nations.
As a result of UN pressure, Iraq returned antiques belonging to the Kuwaiti
royal family which had been housed in the national museum.
But the Homaizi antiques, one of the world's biggest private collections of
Islamic art, were not returned. Their whereabouts remained a mystery until a
few months ago, when Sotheby's received a package for auction from Amman
containing a 12th-13th century brass candle-stick which it subsequently
identified as part of the missing Homaizi collection.
In London, police confirmed yesterday that they had arrested a man, believed
to be a Jordanian, in connection with some Dollars 400,000 worth of
antiques.
It is understood that the arrest follows the identification of further
Kuwaiti antique items which have been routed to London via Amman.
Sotheby's is a founder of the computerised International Art Loss Register,
set up to alert dealers around the world to suspected stolen goods.
Emerging details on the whereabouts of the Kuwaiti antiques is likely to
bring embarrassment to the Jordanian government. It comes against a
background of reports that Jordan was used as a diversionary route for
stolen goods and arms during and after the Iraqi occupation of Kuwait.
Sotheby's specialist knowledge of the Kuwait collection dates back to 1991
when it agreed to help Mr Yasim Homaizi in drawing up an inventory and
pricing the missing items. A list was based on photographs and records which
Mr Homaizi had kept with him while living in exile during the Iraqi
occupation.
The items that turned in London are to be returned to Mr Homaizi.
Yesterday, Sotheby's refused to give details of the prices involved,
although it confirmed that the collection ran into 'millions of pounds.'
The candle-stick was one of the most valuable items, equivalent in price,
according to a Sotheby's expert, 'to a Rembrandt'.

FT  05 AUG 93 / A monument to Hosokawa's initiative: Gordon Cramb on the
record of Japan's new PM who had a liking for modernist projects
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GORDON CRAMB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ARISTOCRAT who helped break Japan's 38-year-old political mould and is
due to be elected today as prime minister has never held a cabinet post. For
eight years, though, Mr Morihiro Hosokawa ran one small part of the country
 -where he became known in equal measure as marketing man, internationalist,
and builder of modernist municipal monuments.
He described his job, as governor of the southern Kumamoto prefecture until
1990, as that of the region's top salesman. He brought in Dentsu, the
country's biggest advertising agency, to promote a 'cultural infrastructure'
which included the erection of dozens of design-conscious public buildings.
'On the surface he was successful but it cost a lot of public money,' says
Mr Hatsuo Yamashita, branch general secretary of the Social Democratic
party, which is one of the seven partners in the coalition which Mr Hosokawa
will head.
'Visually Kumamoto has been changed but in the way it functions nothing much
is different.'
Kumamoto North police station is one striking example of the sort of
building Mr Hosokawa has promoted. An inverted wedge of glass which cost
Y2.5bn (Pounds 15.8m), it formed part of Mr Hosokawa's so-called Artpolis
construction programme aimed at promoting quality of life in Kumamoto and
its image nationally and abroad.
It was completed as Mr Hosokawa's term ended. The shape of the police
station provides a symbol of what local political foes and colleagues from
the period agree was a 'top-down' administrative style, strong on initiative
and short on consultation.
Mr Hosokawa is credited in Kumamoto with bringing the relatively poor
prefecture to national attention through projects such as the Artpolis, as
well as the Technopolis research and development centre for which he raised
more than Y2bn from local donations. He also brought in an agricultural
programme to encourage communities to become more specialised in what they
grow.
His popularity was always high, with an approval rating towards the end of
his term put by one local opinion poll at more than 70 per cent. In part
this reflects the traditionalist populace of the region, many of whom revere
Mr Hosokawa, whose family ruled there for more than two centuries until
1868. Some called him (tono-sama (lord).
His increases in construction spending, however, dented the share of the
budget going to social security and to education. Although these grew in yen
terms as the budget expanded in the prosperous 1980s, opponents point out
that the outlay on education, in which he professes a special interest,
shrank from 27.5 per cent of all spending to 24 per cent during his time in
office.
Yet the Artpolis projects provided high-quality public housing estates, and
the 30 per cent of the budget allocated to construction was not out of line
compared with other prefectures. However, some projects appear to be an
eccentric indulgence typical of the high spending years in late-1980s Japan
 -an outdoor theatre with one of the largest stages in the country goes
unused most of the year because of the region's high rainfall.
Mr Arata Yamauchi, Mr Hosokawa's budget director for Mr Hosokawa's first
four years in office and deputy governor during his second term, says: 'He
saw the historic buildings in Kyoto and Nara (two former capitals of Japan)
and wanted to create the same in Kumamoto - buildings which will last
century after century.'
Mr Hosokawa 'taught people not to depend on the central government', says Mr
Yamauchi. An advocate of decentralisation, the governor had perennial
run-ins with the bureaucrats of Tokyo, to whom he once famously claimed he
had to defer if the prefecture wanted a bus stop moved.
Between leaving the governorship (he declared that corruption sets in if
politicians stay in office too long) and founding the Japan New party last
year, he was invited to chair a government commission on administrative
reform.
He suggests that the rejection of its findings by ministry officials and by
conservatives in the ruling Liberal Democratic party, to which Mr Hosokawa
had until then been loyal, was one factor convincing him that the
established order in Tokyo had to be overturned.
His economic record is mixed. Kumamoto still hovers around 30th out of the
47 prefectures, ranked by per capita income. Some 220 companies, including
car component makers, moved to Kumamoto during his tenure, although it has
so far failed to win foreign investment in manufacturing from abroad. This
is despite a 'foreigners first' policy instituted by Mr Hosokawa offering
preferential incentives to non-Japanese companies.
One group of Kumamoto residents in particular is placing great faith in his
ability as premier - the remaining victims of the Minamata poisoning scandal
of the mid-1950s, when a chemical factory in the fishing town knowingly
pumped mercury sludge into the bay, causing Japan's worst industrial
pollution incident.
As governor, Mr Hosokawa sought in vain to break a legal logjam in the
battle for compensation for the thousands disabled by eating tainted fish.
Tokyo imposed a narrow definition of those entitled to compensation, and
with the average age of sufferers now above 70, an early settlement 'will be
a test of his ability in government', argues Mr Nobuya Hidaka, Kumamoto
general secretary for the Japan Communist party, which will remain outside
the national coalition.
With fissures emerging within the seven-party coalition even before it takes
office, and reform of the cash-consuming electoral system as almost the sole
item on its agenda, Mr Hosokawa will have his work cut out to deliver even
on that. There may be no time for other matters - least of all monument
building.

NIGERIA'S political crisis took a new turn yesterday when Chief Moshood
Abiola, winner of the country's aborted presidential election, arrived in
London to press his claim for recognition as the country's civilian leader.
He left Lagos on Tuesday night in his private jet bound for the northern
city of Katsina, according to the flight plan. The jet flew on to Luton
airport, where he landed early yesterday.
A close aide said the Social Democratic party leader feared for his life.
Later in the day, however, Mr Abiola denied there was anything unusual about
his arrival, saying he was en route to Washington for discussions on recent
developments in Nigeria.
He left behind a divided SDP. He and senior party officials are at odds over
President Ibrahim Babangida's proposed interim government.
In an interview with the BBC yesterday, Mr Abiola again rejected it and
pressed his claim on the presidency. Earlier in the day, however, a party
official in Lagos defended the idea, saying that Gen Babangida had promised
that an interim government would be wholly civilian.
Mr Abiola apparently won the presidential election in June but the military
cancelled the polls and offered the SDP and the one other legal party, the
National Republican Convention, a choice between a fresh election and an
interim government.
Gen Babangida has repeatedly promised that the military will hand over power
to civilians by August 27, but on Saturday he said the proposed interim
government was 'a consensus arrangement for concluding the transitional
agenda of this administration'.
Mr Amos Idakula, SDP spokesman, told Reuter yesterday that the president had
made his promise about a civilian administration on July 5 when he first
presented the two parties with the choice.
Mr Abiola's supporters in the SDP have accused the party's national officers
of selling out to the government. Twenty-four of the 30 state chairmen of
the SDP also dissociated themselves from the interim government proposal on
Tuesday.

FT  05 AUG 93 / Current account surplus up 19.8% in first half
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
JAPAN'S current account surplus in the six months to June rose by 19.8 per
cent from a year earlier to Dollars 67.5bn (Pounds 45.30bn). It is on course
for a new record total this year in spite of appreciation of the yen and US
attempts to improve market access.
The current account surplus for the month of June was a record Dollars
10.7bn, compared to Dollars 9.4bn last year, and reflected the influence of
a large trade surplus, Dollars 11.6bn, though the finance ministry expects
the stronger yen to slow the expansion of that surplus in coming months.
During the first half, Japan recorded an unusual Dollars 2bn surplus on its
invisible trade, which is generally pushed into deficit by the influence of
the tourist outflow.
The ministry said an increase in receipts on investment abroad had turned
the account around, although there was a deficit of Dollars 443m for June.
Japanese investors' net sales of foreign bonds during the month were Dollars
3.04bn, compared to net purchases of Dollars 4.58bn in May, while they were
net purchasers of Dollars 1.24bn in equities, up from Dollars 414m in May.
Foreign investors net purchases of Japanese bonds in June were Dollars
2.3bn, while they sold Dollars 239m in stocks.
Finance ministry officials fear that the immediate effect of the renewed
strengthening of the yen in recent days will be to push the trade and
current account sur-pluses higher, provoking further calls from Washing-ton
for new market opening measures.
Officials in the finance ministry and the ministry for international trade
and industry are also concerned that a coalition government, expected to
take office today, will be unable to agree on a response to US requests for
a new spending package to stimulate the economy and, in theory, increase
imports.
Japan's current account surplus has grown year-on-year for 27 consecutive
months, although the seasonally adjusted surplus for June fell 19.4 per cent
from May, giving the government hope that the expansion, which began after
the collapse of the finance bubble, is coming to an end.

FT  05 AUG 93 / Tokyo tries to close chapter on 'comfort women'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GORDON CRAMB
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN yesterday attempted to seal a chapter in its history which has
provoked fierce hostility from its Asian neighbours, by acknowledging that
its imperial army during the Pacific war coerced a large number of women
into providing sexual services in the countries it occupied.
The admission came on what was expected to be the final day of the Liberal
Democratic party's 38 years in office, and 48 years since Japan's forces
surrendered.
A statement by Mr Yohei Kono, chief cabinet secretary and newly elected
party leader, went further than previous efforts by Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the
outgoing prime minister, to atone for the so-called 'comfort women' issue.
It follows an 18-month government inquiry which showed that women were kept
in 'comfort stations' most notably in Korea but also in China, the
Philippines, Indonesia, Thailand, Burma, Hong Kong, Macao, the then Malaya,
New Guinea and French Indochina, as well in as Japan itself.
Some 35 surviving Korean inmates gave testimony. Several court hearings
remain to be processed in Japan's tortuous legal system.
The timing of the report's release signals a desire to resolve the issue on
the part of the LDP, which is trying to project a more open image in the
wake of its defeat in last month's general election.
On Tuesday, Mr Tsutomu Hata, of the Japan Renewal party and likely deputy
prime minister in a new government, and the Social Democratic party's Ms
Takako Doi, designated lower house speaker, both promised to seek full
reconciliation with countries invaded during the war.
Mr Kono said yesterday the brothels were operated 'in response to the
request of the military authorities' whose personnel at times 'directly took
part in the recruitments' of women, which 'were conducted generally against
their will'.
Accepting that the practice was both widespread and of long duration, he
said the women 'suffered immeasurable pain and incurable physical and
psychological wounds'.
Mr Miyazawa, confronted with the issue before a trip to Seoul last year,
offered an apology in which he said it was undeniable that women had been
recruited. The extent of coercion involved has not been admitted before,
however.
Still, the latest report gives no indication of the number of women involved
(estimates suggest upwards of 100,000 in Korea alone) and insists that
private recruiters were largely responsible for rounding them up.
While a senior foreign ministry official acknowledged last night that many
of the women were held without pay, he declined to accept terms such as sex
slaves and avoided recognising the episode as a war crime.

FT  05 AUG 93 / S Korea's chaebol get protection against state: John Burton
looks at a court ruling on a conglomerate's fate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BURTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A COURT ruling last week overturning the forced dissolution of a South
Korean conglomerate could mark a turning point by easing the government's
centralised control over industry and the financial system.
The decision, overruling a 1985 government order disbanding the Kukje group,
is seen as improving the legal protection of the country's industrial
groups, or chaebol, against state interference.
Although the government of President Kim Young-sam welcomed the ruling as
promoting its policy of economic deregulation, it could hamper the
administration's efforts to streamline the chaebol and reduce their
dominance in the Korean economy.
The Kukje case is a textbook example of how the government used the
financial system to control the chaebol in the past three decades.
Kukje and other chaebol grew on soft government loans in the 1960s and 1970s
as they led the country's rapid industrialisation. But the extensive
borrowings made the chaebol dependent on the state for their survival since
they were highly leveraged. Kukje, for example, had an astronomical
debt-to-equity ratio of 964 per cent when it was dissolved.
When Kukje encountered financial problems, the government of President Chun
Doo-hwan, the former military dictator, refused to let the banks, which
operate under close state guidance, provide new loans to save the group.
Instead, Kukje was broken up under government direction and its 20
subsidiaries were sold to companies considered to have close ties to the
Chun administration.
The South Korean constitutional court, in declaring the Kukje dissolution
illegal, explained that the action was an infringement of private property
rights.
'The ruling meant that the legal system, not arbitrary government decisions,
should determine the fate of companies, such as whether they can be
liquidated,' explained Mr John Wadle, an analyst with BZW in Seoul.
Kukje was not alone. Almost 80 ailing private companies were forcibly
merged, liquidated or sold by the Chun administration during the mid-1980s
as part of an industrial rationalisation programme, following similar
restructuring efforts ordered by earlier governments.
The new owners of these companies were provided with extensive financial and
tax benefits by the government to support their takeovers. Banks were
ordered by the state to suspend collecting interest on loans that had
previously been made to the troubled companies in order to ease financial
pressure on their new owners.
This has been blamed for substantially contributing to the banks' current
heavy burden of non-performing loans. Independent analysts estimate the
amount of non-performing loans has reached Won11,000bn (Pounds 9.2bn),
although the official figure is Won2,300bn.
The Chun government justified its action by arguing that confiscated
companies were poorly managed and could survive only under more efficiently
run business groups. But critics allege Kukje and some other companies were
taken from owners who did not support the Chun government.
Whatever the cause, the break-up of Kukje underscored the vulnerability of
the other chaebol to the government's control of the financial system.
Kukje's demise was interpreted as a warning that any chaebol that fell out
of favour with the government could be subject to credit restrictions and
possible bankruptcy.
These fears were revived last year when Hyundai, the country's largest
conglomerate, suddenly had problems getting loans after its founder, Mr
Chung Ju-yung, declared a presidential bid against the ruling party
candidate, Mr Kim.
Although President Kim has promised to reduce state intervention in the
banking sector, the family owners of the biggest conglomerates remain
concerned that he may resort to using credit controls and tax laws to force
them to dispose of companies as part of the chaebol reform policy.
The ruling could provide the chaebol with a constitutional argument against
such moves since the court based its Kukje decision on a constitutional
article stating that the economy is governed by the 'principle of individual
freedom'.
Although the ruling has improved the general position of business in
relation to government, it could adversely affect some companies. Companies
that took over businesses confiscated by the Chun government could face
court battles as their former owners try to regain control.
The ruling may discourage the government from intervening to save companies
in financial trouble. The state until now has virtually guaranteed that
important companies would never go bust.
This would also mean reduced government interference in determining bank
loan policy. The state traditionally has directed banks to provide
low-interest loans to strategic industries or financially weak companies
whose collapse could cause significant unemployment.

PALESTINIAN deportees stranded in a south Lebanon no man's land demanded
yesterday that the US pressure Israel to take them back, Reuter reports from
Zahle, Lebanon.
The nearly 400 deportees issued their demand before the arrival in eastern
Lebanon of Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, on the fourth leg
of a mission to revive stalled 21-month-old Middle East peace talks.
'Eight months have passed and (UN) Security Council Resolution 799 has not
been implemented. We demand Christopher to pressure Israel for our return,'
said deportee leader Mr Abdul Aziz Rantisi.
Resolution 799, passed a day after Israel expelled the men accusing them of
being linked to hostile Islamic groups last December, demanded Israel allow
them all back immediately. Israel refused to implement the resolution but
cut the maximum term in exile for the men to one year.
Mr Rantisi said about 80 sick deportees should be allowed back and said the
men were waiting for the International Committee of the Red Cross to reveal
the result of contacts with Israel.
On Monday, Israel said some more deportees would be eligible to return in
September, taking the total number who could go back to around 200.
Mr Christopher arrived in the town of Zahle yesterday. Officials said his
talks would focus on hopes to revive Arab-Israeli peace negotiations, which
the US had feared would be derailed by Israel's assault on south Lebanon
last week.

FT  05 AUG 93 / Voting reforms approved in Italy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE PROSPECT of an early general election in Italy has drawn closer
following approval by the lower house of parliament, the Chamber of
Deputies, of crucial electoral reforms.
Yesterday's decision, which came after Senate approval late on Tuesday
night, means the election will largely be fought on a majority voting
system, with a small element of proportional representation.
The decisions were the final stage of a process begun after a referendum in
April gave overwhelmingly support for a change in voting for the Senate.
Though not required by law, this provided the impetus for similar changes in
respect of the lower house.
This week's final approvals, which required both chambers to pass each
other's reforms, remove one of the biggest obstacles to a new election.
Voting, originally expected later this year, will probably take place early
in 1994, as parliament now has four months to draw up and approve new
constituency boundaries and pass the 1994 budget.
Under the new voting arrangements, three-quarters of the seats in the upper
and lower houses will be allocated via a UK-style 'first past the post'
system. The rest will be filled by proportional representation. Polling will
take place on a single day.
The current electoral system, based purely on proportional representation,
has been blamed for the fragmentation of Italian politics and the
proliferation of parties.
Electors in future will complete two voting forms for the lower house: one
for the 'first past the post' constituency-based system, the other to
express a party preference for the remaining seats.
Parties will be excluded if they win less than 4 per cent of the votes
nationally under the proportional system, which divides the country into 27
electoral regions.
Support for the reforms has not been unanimous. Several parties favoured
either an exclusively majority voting system, or two-rounds voting as in
France.
Attention in parliament, in recess from the end of this week, will now
switch to redrawing constituencies.

FT  05 AUG 93 / Yeltsin hits out on rouble
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By AGENCIES and LEYLA BOULTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RUSSIAN President Boris Yeltsin said yesterday that the controversial rouble
reform was in general a good idea but its implementation had been badly
prepared, agencies report.
Mr Yeltsin told second world war veterans in the southern city of Oryol that
discord between the central bank and finance ministry was to blame for the
reform fiasco.
'On the whole, the bank's decision is understandable,' he said. The large
number of different banknotes in circulation had whipped up inflation and
helped crime.
But he said the move had been 'poorly thought out and poorly prepared'.
The central bank caused turmoil with its decision last month to withdraw
pre-1993 roubles and to give people only a short time to change over a
limited amount of old banknotes. Mr Yeltsin, who had been away on holiday,
softened the terms of the move, allowing more time to change a larger amount
of old cash.
Mr Boris Fyodorov, the finance minister, who was out of the country when the
central bank acted, has condemned the move as economically and politically
harmful.
Mr Yeltsin, who was trying to revive his political popularity with his visit
to Oryol, told agricultural researchers that free market reforms would
continue despite the efforts of hardliners in the Russian parliament.
Leyla Boulton adds: The Association of Russian Banks said yesterday it had
asked the Constitutional Court to examine the central bank's controversial
and botched rouble reform. The association said the central bank had
exceeded its authority and violated citizens' property rights.

FT  05 AUG 93 / Germany's steel groups seek to ease coal pact
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NEGOTIATIONS have begun which could radically change an agreement committing
German steel producers to buy all their coking coal from high-price domestic
producers.
Thyssen, Krupp-Hoesch, Mannesmann and Preussag, Germany's largest
steel-makers, are discussing with Ruhrkohle, which produces 80 per cent of
the country's coking coal, a partial lifting of a 1991 contract compelling
them to buy from domestic sources.
The talks follow a Duisburg court ruling allowing Klockner-Werke, the
steel-maker recently rescued from bankruptcy, to use imported coke, which is
30 per cent cheaper, for 30 per cent of its needs.
Thyssen and Krupp-Hoesch argue that the ruling effectively invalidates the
purchasing agreement which sought to ensure the survival and gradual
restructuring of the heavily-subsidised German mines by 2005.
'We cannot accept that a competitor is allowed to buy cheaper coal and stand
by doing nothing,' a Thyssen official said.
Ruhrkohle, whose unsold stocks of coal and coke rose by 3.5m tonnes last
year because of declining orders from the recession-hit steel industry, said
the negotiations could jeopardise a further 2m tonnes of coal a year.
Klockner-Werke won backing in June from its creditors, including the
European Commission, for a debt write-off scheme despite warnings by other
steel-makers that it would affect the entire German steel and coal industry.
Steel industry sources said the solution might be for Ruhrkohle to keep its
monopoly but to sell 30 per cent of its output at import prices.
Such a move could give a large boost to the competitiveness of German
steel-makers, which complain that the system puts them at a disadvantage
against foreign producers.
Thyssen, the largest company, produces half its own coke, buying the rest
from Ruhrkohle. But Krupp-Hoesch, the newly-merged steel giant, will shortly
rely entirely on coke from Ruhrkohle after it closes its coking plant in
Rheinhausen later this month.
An official at Ruhrkohle, which is owned by steel and utilities groups,
warned that lower prices would accelerate the closing of mines and loss of
jobs. It is already planning 20,000 redundancies in the next two years after
cutting 7,300 jobs in 1992.
'We are all in the red. We have to find a common solution to get out of the
crisis,' he said.
Talks this year on the mines' future and their financing have already proved
fruitless.

<TEXT>
AT LEAST three EC commissioners are not expected to attend tomorrow's
emergency meeting of the European Commission to discuss the fall-out from
the explosion in the exchange rate mechanism.
Likely absentees among the 17-strong Commission include Mr Peter
Schmidhuber, German commissioner responsible for the budget; Mr Bruce
Millan, British commissioner responsible for regional aid; and Madame
Christiane Scrivener, the French commissioner responsible for EC tax policy.
Mr Jacques Delors, president of the Commission, who is still suffering from
sciatica at his home in Clichy, near Paris, will attend. He is said to be
disappointed that his call for a special Commission session in Brussels has
failed to persuade all commissioners to break holiday plans or previous
engagements.
Commission officials describe tomorrow afternoon's gathering as the first
chance to examine economic and political consequences of the crisis which
has forced the EC to abandon its system of tightly managed exchange rates.
The increased threat of currency fluctuations will have a 'profound impact'
on EC farm prices, a Brussels official said. For the first time in 15 years,
German farmers face falling prices because of the likely upward revaluation
of the D-Mark. Equally important are the implications for the 1994 budget of
EC currency devaluations against the Ecu.
At least four EC commissioners, including Sir Leon Brittan, the Community's
chief trade negotiator, are in France. Mr Padraig Flynn, the Irish social
affairs commissioner, is in County Mayo. Mr Yannis Paleokrassis, Greek
commissioner responsible for the environment, will travel from Greece.
Mr Joao de Deus Pinheiro, former Portuguese foreign minister who handles
information policy at the Commission, will also be present.

PEACE TALKS on Bosnia yesterday appeared on the verge of collapse despite a
decision by Mr Alija Izetbegovic, the Bosnian president, to end his
three-day boycott in protest at a Bosnian Serb assault on heights
overlooking Sarajevo.
Last night, after Mr Izetbegovic said he would return to the talks, Bosnian
Serb leader Radovan Karadzic and Mr Mate Boban, his Croat counterpart, left
Geneva. Mr John Mills, a spokesman for the Geneva peace talks, said they
might return tomorrow. The presidents of Serbia and Croatia, were also due
to leave.
Mr Mills said international mediators Lord Owen and Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg
hoped that there would now be a meeting of the three main protagonists
tomorrow.
Mr Izetbegovic's return to the negotiating table hinged on Serb forces
complying with a 24-hour deadline to withdraw from key mountains around
Sarajevo they seized over the past few days.
General Ratko Mladic, commander of the Bosnian Serb forces, refused to
withdraw from positions on Mount Bjelasnica and Mount Igman, despite Nato
acceptance of US proposals earlier this week to carry out air strikes if the
Bosnian Serbs did not end their 'strangulation' of Sarajevo.
Gen Mladic reportedly told a UN commander at Sarajevo airport: 'Our forces
are at the summits of Bjelasnica and Igman. If you want you can go see for
yourselves.'
The fall of Mt Igman would tighten the Serbian siege around Sarajevo and
give the Serbian artillery strategic control over Sarajevo's airfield. Last
night, however, Brig Gen Vere Hayes of the UN said Sarajevo was being
strangled by a Moslem offensive in central Bosnia which was blocking relief
supplies, rather than the Serb assault on Mt Igman.
Mr Karadzic said he was 'going home to calm the situation' after a blunt
message from Mr Reginald Bartholomew, President Bill Clinton's special
envoy. After meeting Serb leaders, Mr Bartholomew made clear that he had
underlined the seriousness of the Nato communique.
Nato officials met UN officials in the former Yugoslavia to discuss the
logistics of the air strikes. But diplomatic sources indicated disagreement
remained about how the Nato-endorsed action would fit in with UN
resolutions.
Although Washington has demanded that any air strikes be carried out under
the control of Admiral Jeremy Boorda, the US Nato commander of Allied Forces
Southern Europe, France continued to insist that the action should be
co-ordinated by the French commander of UN troops in Bosnia, General Jean
Cot.
In London, a ministerial delegation from the Organisation of the Islamic
Conference sought to step up pressure on the UN to defend the Moslems.

West German industrial orders fell by 1.6 per cent in June compared with
May, writes Judy Dempsey in Berlin. However, demand for consumer goods rose
1.5 per cent. The federal economics ministry said a 3.7 per cent decline in
capital goods was largely to blame for the greater than expected fall in
industrial orders.
Foreign orders fell only 0.9 per cent, but economists are concerned about
the impact on exports of last weekend's changes to the ERM.

KURDISH guerrillas stopped two minibuses travelling in the south-east of
Turkey yesterday and gunned down about 20 civilian passengers and wounded 10
others, agencies report from Istanbul.
Gunmen of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) stopped the minibuses near
Bitlis in south-east Turkey and forced all of the estimated 30 passengers
out of the bus and shot them, according to the semi-official Anatolian news
agency.
It said the wounded were flown to the town's state hospital by helicopters.
Earlier, Turkish officials said a PKK rocket attack killed eight soldiers
and two state-paid village guards at a military post near Yuksekova in
Hakkari province, near the Iranian border, on Tuesday night.
Two other soldiers and three village guards were badly wounded in the
attack. More than 6,550 people have been killed in Turkey since the PKK
began its fight for an independent Kurdish state in 1984.

FIGURES released yesterday by Germany's Federal Statistics Office show west
German industrial orders for June fell by 1.6 per cent compared with the
previous month, writes Judy Dempsey in Berlin.
However, demand for consumer goods rose 1.5 per cent over the same period.
A statement issued by the federal economics ministry said the fall in
industrial orders, greater than economists had expected, was due largely to
a fall in orders for capital goods. These dropped by 3.7 per cent in June
compared with May. Orders for May and June together fell in real terms by
7.3 per cent compared with the same period in 1992.
The fall in foreign orders was only slighty down, by 0.9 per cent, but
economists were concerned about the possible impact the radical changes to
the bands in the Exchange Rate Mechanism would have on German exports over
the next few months.

FT  05 AUG 93 / French bank proposal challenged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRANCE'S constitutional council has challenged government legislation to
make the Bank of France independent, ruling that important parts of the law
cannot be enforced until the Maastricht treaty on European union comes into
effect.
However, the government yesterday played down the ruling, saying that the
treaty should be ratified by all 12 European Community members by the end of
the autumn. It would reintroduce the legislation then.
'We will introduce the law in identical form to the initial text,' said an
official at the economy ministry. He added that the council ruling would not
affect the timing of the implementation of the law because certain
administrative procedures, in particular the formation of the central bank's
governing committee, had still to be completed.
The council decided that since the French constitution granted the
government responsibilities for deciding the nation's policies, parliament
could not grant the Bank of France the power to determine important areas of
economic policy.
It further said that parliament could not forbid the central bank to receive
instructions from the government.
The French government is seeking to create an independent central bank to
increase the credibility of the country's commitment to price stability.
Independence for the French bank is also an important step towards the
creation a European central bank as part of the process of European monetary
union.
This process has suffered a setback following the widening of exchange rate
bands within which currencies of the European exchange rate mechanism can
fluctuate. Wider bands were agreed last weekend in Brussels following
sustained attacks on the French franc and other ERM currencies.
The constitutional council's ruling is the second time in a month that it
has clashed with the government. At the end of July, it ruled against a law
on the reform of university education.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HOPES are receding that the dream of a tolerant, multi-ethnic Bosnia can be
maintained in the face of intensified fighting and the apparent willingness
of the international community to countenance the ethnic carve-up of the
country at the Geneva peace talks.
Bosnian Moslem President Alija Izetbegovic yesterday publicly acknowledged
the defeat of a multi-ethnic Bosnia, and reluctantly admitted that a
tripartite division of Bosnia is inevitable, 'because it will give Moslems a
Bosnian state. For the moment the idea of a multi-ethnic Bosnia is dead.
Future generations can hope for such a state. But only after they have
sobered up from their state of drunkeness,' he told Radio Sarajevo. 'While
other countries are moving towards multi-ethnicity we have taken a step
backwards.'
Events this week have highlighted the fears of Bosnian Moslems, Croats and
Serbs that what remains of the multi-ethnic fabric of the country is fast
disappearing. The current Moslem offensive on Croat-held towns in central
Bosnia has followed an earlier land grab by Serb forces, and Croat troops to
tighten their stranglehold over what remains of Bosnia.
The fighting prompted Croat members of the Bosnian presidency, whose true
allegiances may be with Croat nationalists, to withdraw from the ten-member
body in protest against the attacks by Moslem forces on Croat troops and
civilians. Mr Miro Lasic, a Croat member of the presidency, said that 'even
in Sarajevo, Croats literally disappear from the streets. Serbs, too, as
well as urban Moslems.'
Mr Miro Lazovic, a Serb member of the Bosnian presidency, warns that in the
event of tbe republic's partition over one million people will cross ethnic
lines, fearing for their fate after 16 months of war.
Mr Lazovic, a member of Bosnia's wartime presidency which includes
representatives of the republic's three main ethnic groups, is struggling to
preserve a state which has been mostly anihilated by Serb and Croat
territorial ambitions.
Serb leaders of the self-styled Srpska Republika have already created their
ethnic state, by killing or expelling hundreds of thousands of Moslems from
about 70 per cent of Bosnia.
Croat nationalists have also hammered out the borders of their own
mini-state, which over the last week has shrunk during the Moslem offensive.
The ethnic division of Bosnia will effectively punish non-nationalist Serbs
and Croats, who will be left without a country. They are now wondering what
will happen to their families.
Mr Nijaz Durakovic, a Moslem opposition deputy who is married to a Serb,
says: 'The international community's goal was to stop the war, not to divide
up Bosnia.'

A DEBATE has begun in France's governing RPR-UDF coalition about when and
how quickly to cut borrowing rates.
Some members of the Gaullist RPR, notably Mr Phillipe Seguin, the national
assembly president, are believed to favour rapid action in order to
capitalise on the easing of the franc/D-Mark link.
Mr Nicolas Sarkozy, government spokesman, said government and president had
been in total accord over last weekend's currency crisis.
Meanwhile, Mr Gunter Rexrodt, Bonn economics minister, has disputed the
French view that high German interest rates caused the crisis.
In an interview with Le Monde newspaper, he pointed out that high German
rates had not prevented France from reviving its economy and resolving its
structural economic problems.

FT  05 AUG 93 / Secret service scandal seizes the Czech imagination: Patrick
Blum on charges of the sale of confidential information
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK BLUM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE indictment last week by a Prague military court of a secret service
agent threatens to open a corruption scandal involving the Czech Republic's
secret service, a maverick businessman and leading politicians.
All have been drawn into a web of allegations made by Mr Vaclav Wallis, a
48-year-old former member of the StB, the communist secret police. Mr Wallis
is awaiting trial on charges of selling private and economic information
gathered by the secret services before and after the 'velvet' revolution
which overthrew communism in 1989.
The scandal has been fed by a daily diet of news and 'revelations' which has
occupied the front pages of local newspapers since Mr Wallis's indictment,
leading to intense speculation over exactly what and who are involved.
Czech television last week said these included confidential information on
the government's privatisation programme, as well as potentially
compromising information on the private lives of senior Czech politicians,
including President Vaclav Havel and Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus.
The information is said to have been gathered by the StB, and later by the
Federal Security Information Service (FBIS) established in 1991 to replace
the hated StB, and collected within a special file of 'Personalities in
Political and Economic Life'.
The FBIS itself was succeeded by a new Security Information Service (BIS) at
the end of last year, not long before the break-up of the former
Czechoslovakia into separate Czech and Slovak states. Critics say it
continues to harbour many former employees of the FBIS and its Stalinist
predecessor.
The recipient of at least part of this information was Mr Viktor Kozeny, a
controversial young entrepreneur and head of Harvard Capital and Consulting
(HC&amp;C) - one of the country's largest voucher privatisation funds whose
shareholdings have an estimated book value of about Dollars 600m and a
market value more than double that.
Mr Kozeny admits he paid up to Kcs500,000 (Pounds 12,000) to Mr Wallis, but
he says this was because Mr Wallis was blackmailing him by threatening to
reveal damaging information about himself and his business.
In a statement on Tuesday, Mr Kozeny said: 'I was blackmailed by a man whose
real function as employee of this institution (the FBIS) was not known to
me. Neither I nor Harvard Fund have anything to hide.'
Mr Wallis says he supplied the information - including information gathered
by the FBIS on HC&amp;C - at Mr Kozeny's request.
According to CTK, the Czech news agency, the information was passed on to Mr
Kozeny between March and December 1992. Mr Wallis was arrested on December 7
while passing information to and accepting Kcs100,000 in payment from Mr
Kozeny, who had informed the FBIS.
Mr Wallis was indicted on charges of abuse of public office and divulging
state secrets and faces up to 10 years in jail if found guilty. Mr Kozeny is
the main witness in the case against Mr Wallis and faces no charges himself.
Mr Kozeny, who set up HC&amp;C with Dollars 3,000 to make it a major shareholder
of some of the Czech Republic's most important financial institutions and
companies, has faced controversy before. HC&amp;C was investigated by the secret
police in 1991, and in January last year, Lidove Noviny, a respected daily
newspaper, revealed that several of its employees were former StB and
interior ministry officials.
Mr Kozeny's rapid success and somewhat brash style have made him many
enemies as well as admirers among Prague's small business and political
community.
At the weekend, several newspapers questioned Mr Kozeny's version of events,
and Lidove Noviny said it was unusual for a blackmailer to make gifts even
in the shape of confidential information to the person he was blackmailing.
Local observers believe the scandal is the most visible sign yet of a
growing web of corruption which involves former communist officials,
organised crime, politicians and businessmen.
Mr Jiri Dienstbier, former dissident and foreign minister after the
revolution, last week said: 'The Wallis affair is like the tip of the
iceberg of a whole system of corruption which is spreading here.'
The Wallis affair, as it is now known, follows a smaller scandal involving
the illegal sale of personal data on 2m Czechs from the interior ministry's
central registry to a private company which, it was alleged, promptly sold
it to Procter and Gamble for an advertising campaign.
An investigation ended inconclusively in June. 'It was impossible to find
out the source (for the information) in an official and legal way,' said Mr
Petr Zelasko, a police official.

FT  05 AUG 93 / Government signals support for N-fuel reprocessing plant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT said yesterday it was 'minded' to give the go-ahead to the
Pounds 2.8bn Thorp nuclear reprocessing plant as it launched a further round
of consultation into the controversial project.
British Nuclear Fuels, owner of the Cumbrian plant, said in one of the
consultation documents published yesterday that Thorp would earn some Pounds
950m for the UK and about Pounds 1.8bn for BNF in the first 10 years of its
life.
Ministers are calling for comments on the economic case for the plant and on
the dangers of nuclear weapons proliferation before deciding whether to
award a licence to start operation.
But they drew sharp criticism from opposition MPs and environmentalists with
the statement that these wider economic and diplomatic questions were
legally 'not relevant' to the government's eventual decision. It was up to
BNF to assess the commercial benefits of Thorp, they said.
Mr John Guinness, BNF's chairman, welcomed the government's support and
hoped Thorp would be given the go-ahead without further delays. The
consultation is due to end on October 4 and the government could make a
final decision by the end of the year.
The plant, which has taken nearly 10 years to build, is designed to extract
reusable uranium and plutonium from used nuclear fuel. Environmentalists say
the attractions of reprocessing have diminished since a 1977 inquiry gave
the go-ahead for Thorp's construction.
Greenpeace, the pressure group, said it was 'considering what legal steps it
will be necessary to take in order to ensure that this consultation is more
than just a sham'. It has threatened to mount a legal challenge if the
government does not adequately consider the economic and diplomatic issues.
The first public consultation addressed only environmental and health
issues. The pollution inspectorate said yesterday it had received 80,000
responses but had found 'no points of substance' to cause it to reconsider
the terms of the draft licence. Its 200-page report, published yesterday,
said the proposed licence would 'effectively protect human health, the food
chain and the environment generally'.
Mr Chris Smith, shadow environment secretary, said the government should
carry out a full independent study of the economic case for the plant.

FT  05 AUG 93 / Vulnerable currencies improve against D-Mark
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ and JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE FRENCH and Belgian francs and Danish krone rose sharply against the
D-Mark yesterday after the countries' respective central banks kept the cost
of borrowing their currencies at extremely high levels in the more relaxed
conditions of the European exchange rate mechanism.
In price movements which astonished many currency dealers, the French franc
ended more than 5 centimes higher against the D-Mark in London trading,
while the Belgian franc closed inside its old ERM fluctuation band.
In New York yesterday, the Danish krone was trading at DKr3.9316 to the
D-Mark, close to its old ERM floor against the German currency of DKr3.9016.
There was no indication yesterday that the three central banks were acting
in concert to support their currencies against the D-Mark, or that they had
established any informal exchange rate targets.
Several dealers in London said the foreign exchange markets had been taken
by surprise, and there may have been heavy losses for banks and speculative
hedge funds which had sold these currencies in the expectation of interest
rate cuts.
'A lot of our dealers and customers do not know what is going on in the
market right now,' said the head of sales at one of London's leading
commercial banks.
Other market operators took a more relaxed view of yesterday's events,
saying that trading had been comparatively thin.
In Paris, there was no indication whether the authorities were aiming to
maintain the franc's exchange rate against the D-Mark or whether interest
rates would be cut today in the Bank of France's regular money market
operation.
Mr Edouard Balladur, the French prime minister, however reaffirmed his
government's commitment to the stability of the franc and to monetary
discipline following the easing of the French franc's link with the D-Mark
in the ERM.
'Nothing that has happened leads me to think that there can be less
financial discipline,' the prime minister was reported as saying.
The sharp decline in the value of the D-Mark was due mainly to the cost of
borrowing funds in the money markets of France, Denmark and Belgium.
The cost of borrowing French francs for one day hovered at about 12 per cent
yesterday, partly because the Bank of France had still not restored a large
portion of the French francs removed from the market when it intervened last
week.
The French franc peaked at FFr3.45 to the D-Mark at one stage, close to its
old ERM floor of FFr3.4305. It later fell back to close at FFr3.466.
The D-Mark's decline also helped to push up the dollar in European trading.
It gained more than  1/2 a pfennig against the D-Mark to close at DM1.7105.
In New York it slipped back to DM1.7068.

FT  05 AUG 93 / Leeds and N&amp;P propose biggest society merger: Opposition
from some members likely as plan threatens 1,600 jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU and JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LEEDS Permanent and the National &amp; Provincial building societies said
yesterday they intended to merge to create the UK's third largest society.
If approved by the societies' 3.3m members, it would be the biggest society
merger.
The merger would be the most significant since that of the Nationwide and
Anglia in 1987, as societies try to increase in size to strengthen their
sales of mortgages and other financial products such as life insurance.
The plan, however, is likely to face opposition from some of the societies'
voting members, after executives disclosed that it could cost 1,600 jobs.
They also said it might not be accompanied by a bonus to savers paid out of
reserves.
The new society would be called Leeds Permanent. Leeds' current chairman, Mr
Malcolm Barr, would be chairman of the merged society. Mr David O'Brien, who
heads National &amp; Provincial, would be chief executive. The announcement
followed an approach to the Leeds by National &amp; Provincial. Renewed
discussions between the societies, which considered merging three years ago,
were sparked by the departure from the Leeds earlier this year of Mr Mike
Blackburn, the chief executive, to head Halifax, the country's largest
society.
The proposed merger, expected to take place next spring, is also subject to
approval by the Building Societies Commission. But the plan is thought to
have been raised already with commissioners, and securing approval is
unlikely to be an obstacle.
Moody's Investor Services, the debt rating agency, placed both societies
under credit review yesterday. Leeds' long-term debt on wholesale markets is
rated higher than N&amp;P's, at Aa3 against A1. The price of Dollars 6bn of debt
securities issued by the societies could be affected.
The Leeds is the UK's fifth largest building society, with total assets of
Pounds 18.3bn while N&amp;P, the eighth largest, has assets of Pounds 12bn. The
merged Leeds would be slightly smaller than Nationwide, second biggest with
Pounds 34.1bn assets.
Leeds currently employs 5,591 staff, while N&amp;P, which is based in Bradford,
employs 4,231. Mr O'Brien said yesterday the maximum number of job losses
would be 1,600. Part-time staff could be made redundant first.
Both societies have strong branch networks in the north of England and would
close those that overlap, although they may merge two branches into a larger
new one. Mr O'Brien said the combined network of 769 branches would be cut
to about 650.
Mr Barr said the proposed merger was 'not a rescue, but a merger of
substance'. Most recent society mergers have taken place when a smaller
society has got into trouble from poor lending and been absorbed by a large
society.
Mr Richard Newton, currently chairman of N&amp;P, who is to retire, said that in
an 'overcrowded' market the decision would bring benefits to the customers
of both societies.

FT  05 AUG 93 / Back to the Fifties for gilt-edged yardstick
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE of the oldest yardsticks of the gilt-edged market is on the threshold of
a level not seen for nearly 40 years. The FT Government Securities Index, a
basket of UK government bonds of various maturities, closed yesterday at
99.8, reflecting the recent strong rally in the gilt market.
The index last touched 100 on April 15 1955, when Sir Anthony Eden was prime
minister and Mr Rab Butler was chancellor. Based at 100 in 1926, it reached
a high of 127.4 in January 1935 and plummeted to a low of 49.18 in January
1975, in an era when inflation exceeded 20 per cent.
The fall in inflation and the decline in UK interest rates in the 1990s have
prompted a strong rally in gilt prices. Base rates have fallen from 10 per
cent to 6 per cent in the past year. Since the shake-up of the ERM, further
cuts are expected, with Mr Roger Bootle, chief economist at Midland Global
Markets, predicting that base rates could fall below 4 per cent by the end
of the year.
With the development of more specific gilt market indices, the Government
Securities Index appears to have lost some of its following. The FT
Actuaries All-Stocks index has become a more popular measure. One gilt-edged
market-maker pointed out that the pension and life funds tend to measure the
performance of their portfolios against gilt indices with specific maturity
dates.

FT  05 AUG 93 / Treasury chief hits back at department's detractors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR Terry Burns, the top civil servant at the Treasury, has strongly
defended the department against critics who accuse it of policy failures
such as sterling's departure from the European exchange rate mechanism and
the decline of manufacturing industry, writes John Willman.
In an article released today, Sir Terry says that much of the criticism
arises from the Treasury's privileged position at the heart of Whitehall,
which makes it an easy target when things go wrong.
Too little credit has been given, he says, for changes made where the
Treasury has acknowledged criticism as well-founded.
Sir Terry concedes that there are arguments for an independent Bank of
England to handle monetary policy, including 'weak' evidence that inflation
is lower in countries with central bank independence.
The demand for greater independence of the central bank is, he says, 'the
most popular single answer to the problem of inflation that was once
reserved for the ERM'.

FT  04 AUG 93 / (CORRECTED) World Trade News: ABB wins Athens airport
contract
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Correction (published 13th August 1993) appended to this article.
A consortium led by Mannheim-based ABB Schaltanlagen, part of Asea Brown
Boveri, has won a Dollars 420m (Pounds 282m) contract to provide and install
all the electrical equipment for the new Athens airport at Sparta, writes
Andrew Baxter.
The contract from the Greek government follows last week's selection of a
consortium led by Hochtief, the German construction company, to build the
airport. The complete project is worth about Dollars 2.3bn. ABB companies
are partners in the overall consortium, and will account for about Dollars
235m of the electrical work won by the subsidiary consortium.
CORRECTION
In the Financial Times of August 4, a contract for a new airport near Athens
was recorded as being at Sparta. It should have read Spata.

FT  04 AUG 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Midwest farmers turn their
attention to frost
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CHICAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ALTHOUGH the Mississippi River has already blighted critical crop-growing
areas of the American Midwest, farmers and commodity traders are now gauging
the probabilities of an early frost.
Delayed plantings, sodden fields, and unusually cool weather have put maize
and soyabean development far behind schedule in the western corn belt, which
includes Iowa, Minnesota, Kansas, and Missouri.
In a year that could see farmers in Ohio, Illinois, and Indiana harvest
record yields while their counterparts to the west watch their crops yellow
from too much rain, crop analysts have found it difficult to put an accurate
estimate on the overall US maize or soyabean production.
Traders at the Chicago Board of Trade have been riding the weather rally
like a steer at a rodeo. The soyabean futures price for November delivery,
after taking a breather last week, rallied by 18 1/2 cents on Monday and in
early trading yesterday remained above Dollars 7 a bushel. The figure was in
spite of some analysts' assessments that prices were overdue for a downside
correction.
The US Department of Agriculture, in a weekly crop report released late on
Monday, said that only half of Iowa's soyabean area was blooming as of
August 1, compared with the 90 per cent normally expected at that time of
year.
Crop development in Minnesota was similarly behind, although warm, sunny
weather had accelerated development in Illinois and pushed Ohio soyabeans
ahead of schedule.
Only a quarter of Iowa's maize crop had tasseled by late last week, behind
the usual level of 85 per cent, while maize crops in Minnesota and Missouri
were also critically underdeveloped.
Farmers have turned from watching their rain gauges to pondering temperature
forecasts.
Mr Terry Francl, senior economist with the American Farm Bureau, estimated
that average maize maturity dates were anywhere from one to five weeks
behind.
The delay was likely to have two major detrimental effects. First, he said,
maize would pollinate later in the season, during the hotter, more stressful
weeks of August. Second, he warned that maize maturity dates were being
pushed to or beyond normal frost dates. Soyabeans were also late developing
and were vulnerable to frost.
The farm bureau has reduced its soyabean production forecast for the entire
US to 1.812m bushels, well below the USDA's July 12 estimate of 1.975m.
The bureau's maize production figure is now at 7.247m bushels, compared with
USDA's 7.850m.
'That is only an estimate,' said farm bureau spokesman Mr Jack King. 'We are
already hearing another 50,000 acres of prime crop land has been destroyed
by levee (embankment) breaks south of St Louis. The water is receding, but
many of the levees have been weakened, and are giving way.'

FT  04 AUG 93 / The Lex Column: European privatisation
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It is a virtually foregone conclusion that the international reach of large
US securities houses will bring them a prominent role in European
privatisation. The question is whether this will also mean the introduction
to Europe of a US-style fee structure for new equity issues. US equity
offerings typically carry fees of 5 per cent or more compared with around 3
per cent currently for European privatisations. Moreover, the oligopoly
enjoyed by US lead managers allows them to take the lion's share of the
total.
Fair though US share allocation rules appear on paper, the lead manager has
undisputed power over the allocation process. Institutions that want to be
sure of receiving shares may thus direct orders towards the lead manager;
co-lead managers receive a guaranteed but small share of the spoils to
encourage them to acquiesce. But the system also limits their incentive to
work on behalf of the vendor.
The UK sought to avoid this sort of result in the latest BT3 issue. Share
allocations were supposedly determined by an impartial formula. Even so,
there was a tendency for buyers to designate SG Warburg as the recipient of
their fees. Warburg thus walked off with around a third of the total. The
lesson for would-be vendors is clear; they must watch the allocation process
carefully to ensure the syndicate is giving them value for money. As for
Warburg, it has discovered how successfully it can sell shares in the US.
Perhaps it should strike out on its own there and undercut the bloated
domestic houses.

FT  04 AUG 93 / Britain to join astronomy project
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN is to join one of the decade's largest astronomy projects, the
Science and Engineering Research Council said yesterday.
Almost all of the Dollars 44m (Pounds 29.5m) it plans to contribute to the
Dollars 176m Gemini project will find its way back to UK industry for
high-technology contracts.
The scheme is a collaboration between the US National Science Foundation
and the governments of Argentina, Brazil and Chile. The National
Research Council of Canada also hopes to join the programme.
UK universities and the council's laboratories will participate in the
design and development of technically advanced systems. The council said
collaboration with strong partners would transfer technology to the UK.
British companies may take part in international tenders for optics,
electronic light detectors and the structural framework of the two
telescopes that are to be built.
The telescopes will be positioned on Mauna Kea in Hawaii and in Chile. The
locations have been chosen for their reliably clear weather and will offer
UK astronomers the latest equipment with which to study the skies.
The telescopes will be unusually large, using main mirrors eight metres
across to gather visible and infra-red light. They will be 10 to 20 times
more sensitive than existing telescopes and will be used to study the
chemical composition, large-scale structure and origin of the universe.
The Hawaiian telescope should start operation in the third quarter of 1998
and the Chilean telescope two years later.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DONOHUE, a large eastern Canada newsprint producer controlled by the
Quebecor publishing and printing group, returned to profitability in the
first half with earnings of CDollars 8.3m (Dollars 6.4m), or 23 cents a
share, against a loss of Dollars 11.3m, or 36 cents, a year earlier. Sales
were up 13 per cent to Dollars 286m.
Second-quarter net profit was Dollars 2m, or 5 cents a share, against a loss
of Dollars 3m, or 10 cents.
Newsprint and timber products shipments were higher with firm prices but
pulp markets declined further. Lower interest rates and a lower Canadian
dollar helped - most of Donohue's production goes to the US.
Canfor, a western Canada forest products group, earned CDollars 17.6m, or 60
cents a share, in the second quarter, against a loss of Dollars 9.1m, or 34
cents. Revenues were up 10 per cent to Dollars 301m. First-half profit
equalled Dollars 1.17 a share, against a loss of 78 cents.
Tembex, an eastern Canada special pulp and cartonboard producer, had a
CDollars 6.7m third-quarter loss, against a loss of Dollars 4.3m. The loss
for nine months was Dollars 34m, against a loss of Dollars 22.7m, on sales
of Dollars 277m, against Dollars 223m.

<DATELINE>
   MISSOURI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THWARTED by St Louis's 11-mile concrete flood wall, the Mississippi turned
on areas south of the city yesterday, Reuter reports from Missouri.
Engineers were forced to break a levee to ease the pressure of the river or
divert it.
The Army Corps of Engineers was keeping a close eye on the town of Prairie
du Rocher, Illinois, where a section of a levee was leavened to try to
divert floodwaters.
Crews on a barge used a crane to scoop gravel off the top of a 400-foot long
section of the Fort Chartres levee to offer a path for floodwaters.
The hope is that flows over farmland parallel to the Mississippi from levee
breaks to the north will either flow back into the river at that spot or at
least slow down.
St Louis's flood wall, designed to withstand a 52-foot crest, held firm
against the Mississippi which crested there on Sunday at 49.4 feet.
Thousands of people were still out of their homes in a residential area in
south St Louis after a forced evacuation on Monday amid fears of an
explosion from leaking propane tanks floating on floodwaters.
More than 9,000 residents in a one-mile radius of the 51 tanks have been
evacuated since the capsules loosened from their moorings on Friday. But as
the water receded, 48 of the tanks resettled into their concrete cradles.

FT  04 AUG 93 / London Stock Exchange: Reuters in demand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and ZHANG TINGTING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Reuters Holdings, the international information and news group,
forged ahead in hectic trading after good US buying the night before.
Dealers said the company's foreign exchange dealing equipment business was
benefiting from the turmoil within the European exchange rate mechanism and
the subsequent volatility in European currencies.
There has also been heavy buying from income funds following Reuters' plan
to use Pounds 350m of its cash pile to buy back 25m shares. Mr Brian Newman
of Henderson Crosthwaite said tax-exempt funds would have shares worth
Pounds 17.20 each after the tender for the 5.84 per cent stake closed on
August 25. Yesterday, the shares ended 18 stronger at 1458p on high turnover
of 2.8m.
Marketing group Kleen-E-Ze Holdings jumped 44 to 226p after a subsidiary
said it had launched a battery charger capable of extending ordinary battery
life by 10 times.
USM-quoted Sherwood Computer Services plummeted 63 to 155p after it said
first-half 1993 earnings would be substantially lower than the year-earlier
half.
Yorkshire Chemicals was one of the worst market performers yesterday, its
shares slipping 17 to 338p. The group reported a rise in half-year profits
to Pounds 6.02m but said recession in Europe was much worse than expected
and it did not believe there would be a significant pick-up in global demand
this year. Analysts said the profits warning had been flagged but the shares
were overvalued.
Life insurer Legal &amp; General gained 7 to 481p as SGST turned buyer of the
stock. Analyst Mr Charles Landa said Legal was trading at its net asset
value and that the hit from mortgage indemnity losses was slightly less
worrying since recent statistics showing that the number of repossessions
had fallen.
In a strong leisure sector, yield and recovery buying dominated, with
Ladbroke surging 7 to 197p in brisk turnover of over 8m. Rank Organisation
also benefited, advancing 14 to 742p. Airtours again basked in the currency
fallout, adding 4 at 380p. A big buyer in Compass Group saw the shares climb
16 to 526p.
Profit-takers were out in force in the food retailers, although news of a
new price promotion from Tesco did little to help. Although the stock
managed a half-penny rise to 214p, others stumbled. J Sainsbury slid 8 to
479p, Kwik Save 8 to 675p and Argyll 2 to 326p.
A combination of yield considerations and recent underperformance spurred BT
ordinary shares forward, closing 6 ahead at 424 1/2 p in good turnover of
16m. BT partly-paid advanced 5 1/4 to 180p.
Profit-taking left Cable and Wireless drifting 17 down at 799p and Vodafone
3 down at 482p.
A programme trade helped Courtaulds Textiles rise 6 to 564p with 2.4m
changing hands. The announcement of the group's Pounds 7m acquisition in the
Spanish lace business was not necessarily the driving force, although the
group gained 40 per cent of the market share through the move, market
analysts said. The upward trend, however, may continue on buying interest in
a thin market and market expectations of some big acquisition projects in
the latter half of the year.
William Baird continued to ride on Monday's market reaction to its disposal
of part of its non-core engineering business and its shares leapt another 8
to 263p.
News International, the international media group, gained 6 to 226p
following its successful purchase last week of a Pounds 350m stake in Star
TV, the Hong Kong-based satellite television system which reaches 38 Asian
countries. United News, which has a yield of over 5 per cent, jumped another
10 to 544p on continued hopes of interest rate cuts in Europe.
In the printing sector, St Ives added 6 to 305p.

FT  04 AUG 93 / London Stock Exchange: NatWest pleases
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and ZHANG TINGTING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The banking sector moved ahead as interim results from National Westminster,
the high street bank, delighted the market and prompted a spate of forecast
upgrades from analysts yesterday. NatWest shares jumped 13 to 510p and were
among the most actively traded of the day, with turnover of 11m.
Headline half-year profits came in at Pounds 421m, almost double the figure
for the first half of last year and well above most expectations. Most of
the rise was the result of the first fall in provisions for bad debts in
three years. Analysts moved end of year forecasts higher, with SG Warburg
raising its estimate by Pounds 130m to Pounds 980m and Smith New Court
moving to Pounds 1.1bn from Pounds 875m for the year ending in December.
Banking analysts said the 6.4p dividend was better than expected and the
capital ratio was good but described the results as mixed. They said the
drop in provisions was a one-off bonus and there were doubts over the
underlying trading position.
However, the general sentiment over a possible turnround in the fortunes of
the banking sector prompted gains across the board. HSBC, whose subsidiary
Midland is reporting today, advanced 14 to 671p in the ordinary stock and
Barclays, which reports tomorrow, moved ahead 13 to 499p.

FT  04 AUG 93 / London Stock Exchange: Waters easier
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and ZHANG TINGTING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Water issues weakened, dragging down some regional electricity companies
with them, as at least two brokers decided that the sector looked
overvalued. BZW struck a cautious note in its latest piece of research,
advising clients to move 'underweight' in the water sector, as it
highlighted potential regulatory dangers likely to be thrown up when Ofwat
makes its next report in the autumn.
BZW suggests that should the regulator adopt a similar view on capital
values to those taken by other regulatory bodies then the water stocks will
look expensive. With their recent post-ERM gains, BZW believes they could be
around 13 per cent overvalued at current values. Ms Angela Whelan, utilities
analyst at BZW, said: 'This represents an excellent opportunity to sell into
strength and realise profits.'
NatWest Securities was also underlining regulatory worries in retaining its
'neutral' stance, suggesting that this month's Ofgas report on British Gas
will have direct implications for how Ofwat decides to act on its sector.
The broker also said that the sector was looking overbought at its morning
meeting. Among those stocks hit, Anglian slipped 5 to 497p, Southern 6 to
525p and Welsh 4 to 584p.

FT  04 AUG 93 / London Stock Exchange: Power stocks upset
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and ZHANG TINGTING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEWS that National Power has issued Pounds 225m of convertible bonds hit
sentiment in the stock and the shares retreated, leading fellow generator
PowerGen lower in their wake. However, analysts were quick to point out that
the bond issue was barely earnings-dilutive and as a result there were no
downgrades forecast from the sector specialists.
Profit-taking was put forward as the main reason for yesterday's share price
falls, National Power having closed on Monday at an all-time high of 371p
after touching 400p. Yesterday the stock lost 11 to 360p, while PowerGen
slipped 7 to 389p.
There were also hints that regulatory issues may become more significant in
determining the stocks' rating.
Shares in both groups have been particularly strong since the pool price
review from Offer, the industry regulator, last Friday which deferred any
decision on price controls until the autumn.
However, the increasingly terse regulatory tone from Offer may have unnerved
some investors, and dealers said yesterday that there were also signs of
switching out of the National Power ordinary shares and into the
convertible. NatWest Securities was one house raising such issues at its
morning meeting, where it reiterated its short-term hold, longer-term
underperform recommendation on both generators.

FT  04 AUG 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow trades in narrow range
throughout day
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US SHARE prices traded in a narrow range yesterday as lower bond yields and
disappointing economic news pulled market sentiment in opposite directions,
writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.28 at 3,561.27. The
more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 ended 0.88 easier at 449.27, while
the Nasdaq composite gained 1.35 at 709.01. New York SE volume was 253m
shares.
After Monday's strong start to the week, consolidation was the order of the
day on stock markets yesterday. The morning's economic news was bearish in
tone - a 0.1 per cent increase in the June index of leading economic
indicators was weaker than expected. The report suggested, like most recent
data, that the economy is growing, but at an unusually modest rate for
normal post-recessionary periods.
While the leading indicators report deflated investor sentiment, there was
some good news from the fixed-income market, where brightened prospects for
the approval of President Bill Clinton's deficit-reduction budget package
provided a sharp lift to government bond prices. In late trading the
benchmark 30-year issue was still noticeably firmer, and the yield had
fallen to 6.52 per cent, close to the lowest level in the bond's history.
Unisys firmed Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 10 3/8 in early trading after the
company announced a joint venture with Intel, the microchip manufacturer, to
develop parallel processing computers. The stock later receded to end
Dollars  1/8 up at Dollars 10 1/8 . Intel, traded on the Nasdaq market, rose
Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 53 in volume of 2.2m shares.
UAL fell Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 141 1/4 after Lehman Brothers, the
investment bank, lowered its rating on the airline stock from 'outperform'
to 'buy', citing price reasons. The decline, however, attracted buyers, and
by the close UAL had recovered to Dollars 143 3/4 , up Dollars 1 1/4 on the
day.
Dr Pepper-Seven Up lost Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 17 3/4 after insurance group
Prudential announced it would sell its 20 per cent stake in the drinks group
in a secondary offering of 11m shares.
Selected cyclical stocks were in demand, including Alcoa, up Dollars 1 3/4
at Dollars 73 1/2 , International Paper, Dollars  1/2 firmer at Dollars 64
5/8 , and Caterpillar, Dollars 1 3/4 ahead at Dollars 79 7/8 .
Chiquita Brands eased initially on Monday's late news that the company was
cutting its dividend to strengthen its balance sheet, but rallied to end
Dollars  1/8 up on balance at Dollars 12 1/2 .
On the Nasdaq market, Apple Computer put on Dollars  1/2 at Dollars 29 in
volume of 1.6m shares after announcing that it is lowering prices of its
Apple PowerBook duo line and several other products.
Other technology stocks were also firmer, including new issue Actel, which
debuted at Dollars 9 1/2 and closed the day at Dollars 13 1/4 after volume
of 4.3m shares.
Canada
TORONTO rose in moderate trading, the TSE 300 index adding 9.3 at 3,976.5,
with advancing issues leading declines by 377 to 318. Volume amounted to
39.8m shares valued at CDollars 381.7m.
Eleven of the 14 sub-group indices finished higher, led by mining, which
gained 2.5 per cent. The golds index declined 2.2 per cent.

FT  04 AUG 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): DAX rises 1.6% after cut in
repo rate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ACTIVITY was less intense yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT, encouraged by an unexpected cut in the repo rate to 6.80 per
cent, gathered momentum, the DAX index closing up 28.35 or 1.6 per cent at
1,843.43. Turnover was DM9bn.
Investors are beginning to look at export-sensitive stocks which would be
affected by a round of Europe-wide interest rate cuts. However, hopes for
lower domestic rates kept the chemical sector, for instance, in positive
mood yesterday: Bayer gained DM3.70 to DM294.40, Basf rose DM5.80 to DM256
and Hoechst, a dollar play, DM2.50 to DM273.
Volkswagen put on another DM7 to DM355.50, although its public argument with
Opel continues afresh, and BMW DM11.50 to 467.50. Allianz, strong on Monday,
was even firmer yesterday, rising DM75 to DM2,390. Bayerische Vereinsbank's
rise in first half profits lifted the shares DM11.50 to DM467.50.
PARIS eased slightly on profit-taking after the heady activity of the last
few days. The CAC-40 index closed down 18.45 at 2,110.58. Turnover dropped
to FFr4.6bn.
Axa rose FFr23 to FFr1,503 while UAP fell FFr18 to FFr606. Elf Aquitaine
slipped FFr4.90 to FFr436.70, while Total gained FFr8.60 or 2.8 per cent to
FFr314.
Canal Plus, subject to downgrades, lost FFr19 to FFr1,211 and
CarnaudMetalbox eased FFr5.90 to FFr220.10 on lower first half sales.
Strong gains in Polygram and Akzo helped AMSTERDAM rise 2.1 or 1.7 per cent
in the CBS Tendency index to 122.9.
Polygram gained Fl 3.60 or 6.4 per cent to Fl 59.50 on results, news that it
was to acquire Motown records and the decision to issue up to 10m new
shares, thereby diluting Philips' stake to 75 per cent from 79.4 per cent.
Philips rose Fl 1.50 or 4.8 per cent to Fl 32.60.
MILAN continued to test its highs for the year and the Comit index rose 3.70
to 576.51.
Opening firmly on hopes for lower interest rates, the market received a
subsequent boost from an announcement that the government had dropped its
last price controls on bread, milk, cement and fertilisers. Unicem, the
cement group added L450 to fix at L7,900 before L8,000 on the kerb, up 7.4
per cent on the day, while Parmalat, the dairy products group added L100 to
L1,838.
Sip advanced L130 to L3,105 while Stet added L83 to L4,123 on continued
strong foreign demand. Olivetti rose L51 or 2.8 per cent to L1,799 and CIR,

speculation of possible benefits from the reorganisation of the Italian
telecoms sector.
ZURICH rose to an all time high supported by expectations of lower rates.
The SMI index rose 30.2 or 1.3 per cent to 2,430.5.

Holderbank was SFr24 ahead at SFr775.
MADRID recovered early losses in late trade but profit-taking proved more
persuasive than an early half point cut in the monthly market rate. The
general index shed 1.63 to 271.11.
BRUSSELS saw some index-linked late buying help the market up from its lows
after profit-taking had erased some of the sharp gains of the previous two
sessions. The Bel-20 index dipped 2.17 to 1,342.46 after a day's low of
1,333.93.
Glaverbel shed BFr110 or 2.9 per cent to BFr3,690 while SGB fell BFr50 to

economy and exports would be enhanced by recent developments.
VIENNA surged 3.1 per cent on renewed hopes of a cut in interest rates and
the ATX index gained 30.75 to 981.75, its highest close this year.

FT  04 AUG 93 / World Stock Markets: Long-term potential seen among Indian
steelmakers - Prospects for the sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As Europe's steelmakers struggle to sort out their problems, counterparts in
developing and industrialising countries face very different challenges -
which could turn into long-term opportunities for investors.
A report last month on the Indian steel market by Mr David Morgan, steel
analyst at Lehman Brothers in London, focuses on the 'excellent long-term
growth potential' of the world's ninth largest steel producer, but coupled
with problems such as low productivity and rigid labour laws
The report does not make share recommendations, but points out the wide
spectrum of investment opportunities among two dozen publicly-listed steel
companies.
Among these are the state-owned Steel Authority of India (Sail), the world's
tenth largest steel company, which sold 10.5 per cent of its stock last year
to local institutions; Tata Iron and Steel (Tisco), the largest private
sector producer and valued on the stock market at about Rs48bn (Dollars
1.5bn); and fast-growing secondary mini-producers such as Mukand and Jindal
Strips.
The report coincides with the launch of three India funds in the past few
weeks, making a total of about 10 such funds. Foreign individuals cannot buy
Indian shares directly, and even foreign institutions need government
approval to invest in India.
The short-term outlook for the Indian steel industry and steel shares is
lacklustre. According to Mr Morgan, the industry has experienced weak demand
and subdued prices for the past year, due mainly to public sector spending
cuts aimed at curbing the budget deficit.
Furthermore, liberalisation of the Indian steel market at the beginning of
last year means that the industry is now more exposed to international
markets, where prices have been weak.
Steel shares have also been caught up in the general volatility of the
Indian stock market because of the government's problems. But last week's
victory for Prime Minister Narasimha Rao in a no-confidence vote gave the
market a much needed boost. The Bombay's BSE index closed yesterday at
2,240.52, up from its 1993 low of 2,036.
But Mr Morgan notes that, in spite of recent problems, the steel industry
has remained profitable, unlike the majority of steel companies in developed
countries. Profitability, he says, is unlikely to remain unsatisfactory
until next year, which could provide investors with a good entry point.
On a long-term basis, however, the Lehman Brothers report shows why the
Indian steel industry is the kind of sector that growth funds ought to find
attractive. An average GDP growth rate of 5 per cent a year looks 'quite
possible' over the next ten years, says Mr Morgan, which could double steel
consumption from its current level of 16m tonnes a year.
The industry, one of the world's lowest cost producers until the mid-1970s,
failed to keep up with new technology under state regulation, which kept
prices low but protected steelmakers with high import tariffs.
But both Sail and Tisco have major modernisation programmes underway, the
leading secondary producers have efficient modern plant, and there are a
number of sizeable new projects employing the latest technology.
The negatives are poor infrastructure, rapidly rising input costs as other
industries are liberalised too, rigid labour laws, plants that are still
inefficient and under-utilised, and finding the money for modernisation and
growth.
Mr Morgan sees enormous scope for productivity improvements at existing
plants but, even with the expansion plans, there will still be a need for
more capacity to satisfy expected demand by the beginning of the next
century. Beyond that, further big demand rises are expected.
But he warns that the post-liberalisation environment is still evolving, and
it is hard to say yet exactly where the growth is going to come from. The
government still controls about half the country's steel production, but has
said that no more integrated plants will be built by the public sector.

Hong Kong by 2.6%

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
STRONG demand in the futures market prompted arbitrage buying, but later
profit-taking eroded most of the share price gains, writes Emiko Terazono in
Tokyo.
The Nikkei average closed marginally ahead but at the day's low of
20,357.64, up 14.11 on the day. The index rose to a high of 20,599.36 in the
morning on strength carried over from overnight trading on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange. The index later declined on small-lot selling by
investment trusts and tokkin, or specified money trusts.
Volume totalled 270m shares, against 261m. Rises led falls by 500 to 430,
with 216 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks ended
2.43 up at 1,657.22. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 1.25 to
1,255.11.
Concern over the higher yen receded as the market hoped that the rise in the
currency will prompt a cut in the official discount rate.
Meanwhile, investors remained inactive ahead of the special parliamentary
session tomorrow, where Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, leader of the Japan New Party,
is expected to be chosen as prime minister.
Financial issues were firm on renewed hopes of monetary easing. Industrial
Bank of Japan appreciated Y80 to Y3,390 and Bank of Tokyo gained Y40 at
Y1,780.
Electronics issues continued to weaken. Hitachi fell Y13 to Y840 and NEC
slipped Y11 to Y999. Steel makers were also lower, with Nippon Steel
finishing Y8 off at Y357.
Speculators traded Nikkatsu, the most active issue of the day, which put on
Y2 at Y25. Mining issues, which gained ground on the rise in gold prices on
Monday, retreated on profit-taking. Mitsui Mining and Smelting shed Y10 to
Y546 and Sumitomo Metal Mining lost Y30 to Y1,060.
In Osaka, the OSE average rose 46.05 to 22,437.09 in volume of 12m shares.
Some individuals and dealers sought bio-technology related issues. Shimano,
the bicycle parts maker, was traded actively on prospects of firm profits,
but was finally unchanged at Y2,820.
Roundup
PACIFIC Rim markets turned in some impressive performances.
HONG KONG advanced 2.6 per cent after a wave of overseas buying which took
the Hang Seng index 182.80 higher to 7,211.83. Trading was quiet for much of
the day but a late flurry of activity near the close brought turnover to a
moderate HKDollars 3.5bn.
Hong Kong Telecom advanced 50 cents to HKDollars 11.40 as some analysts
recommended utilities as being immune to any downturn in the Chinese
economy. China Light was up 75 cents to HKDollars 41.
SINGAPORE finished sharply higher on buying by US funds which concentrated
on index-linked stocks. The Straits Times Industrial index strengthened
31.34, or 1.73 per cent, to 1,844.58.
NEW ZEALAND continued to climb to three-year highs, although activity was
restrained after the recent good volumes, and trading in some second line
stocks was thin. The NZSE-40 Capital index turned around from a weak opening
to close a net 11.57 ahead at 1,826.90 in turnover of NZDollars 44m.
AUSTRALIA crept to another post 1987-crash high, consolidating after recent
strong gains, and the All Ordinaries index closed 0.6 higher at 1,855.4 in
turnover of ADollars 383m.
MANILA again closed at an all-time high although the recent strong rally
began to ease as investors cashed in their gains. The composite index added
7.44 to 1,783.30.
KUALA LUMPUR saw strong institutional buying of banking stocks which lifted
the composite index 8.21 to a new high of 771.67.
TAIWAN edged ahead with many investors sidelined in the absence of fresh
incentives to buy. The weighted index rose 2.73 to 3,949.29 in turnover of
TDollars 9.25bn.
KARACHI was sharply lower as jobbers unloaded stocks to square holdings
ahead of account settlement today. The KSE index fell 17.87 to 1,356.23.

FT  04 AUG 93 / Money Markets: Repo rate is cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE were slightly greater expectations of cuts in German interest rates
yesterday after the Bundesbank set a fixed rate repo at 6.80 per cent, only
5 basis points above the discount rate floor, writes James Blitz.
The German decision to reduce the repo rate from 6.95 per cent to 6.80 per
cent is part of its attempt to regain control of German money markets after
the huge intervention in support of the French franc in recent days.
That intervention may have pushed about DM60bn into the financial system,
and the cost of call money consequently fell substantially to about 6.44 per
cent yesterday.
Dealers said the Bundesbank had to cut the repo rate because, with call
money on offer in the interbank market at these very low levels, few banks
would have been attracted to borrow funds from the central bank today at the
old price.
The repo rate reduction leaves a gap of only 5 basis points between the repo
rate and the Bundesbank's interest rate floor, so there is little more room
for manoeuvre here unless there is another interest rate cut. But dealers
expect the Bundesbank to drain funds from the money market in today's weekly
operation. Dealers anticipate that the Bundesbank will withdraw anything
from DM20bn to DM30bn in this week's repo operation.
The cut in the repo rate led Euromark futures dealers to get a little more
bullish about rate cuts. The September contract was up 8 basis points on the
day at 93.47.
However, in spite of the unravelling of the exchange rate mechanism over the
weekend, expectations of interest rate cuts in France and other European
countries were slightly dashed. France has still not lowered its
intervention rate and the September Pibor contract was down 15 basis points
yesterday, closing at 93.94.
Sterling interest rate futures were softer, partly in the wake of a good
figure for M0 money supply, which was up by a greater amount than expected.
The September contract was down 5 basis points to a close of 94.33.
Three-month sterling cash was unchanged at 5 13/16 per cent yesterday. But
rate cut speculation made the removal of a Pounds 1.2bn shortage difficult.
The overnight rate was up at 13 per cent at one stage, with Pounds 675m of
late assistance.

FT  04 AUG 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Bundesbank calms the market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bundesbank surprised foreign exchange dealers for the third time in
seven days yesterday by bringing down the cost of borrowing short-term funds
in its wholesale money market, writes James Blitz.
The German central bank may have had a strong domestic reason for making the
move, because the fall in call money would have made the old repo rate of
6.90 per cent too unattractive for banks.
Some dealers, however, suggested that the move may have been intended to
help out the other currencies in the European exchange rate mechanism,
several of which could still come under heavy selling pressure now that
their old floors have been removed.
The French franc yesterday stabilised against the D-Mark, closing in London
at FFr3.485 from a previous FFr3.505.
France's determination not to cut its intervention rate yet has settled the
market. But there is little reason for a cut in the intervention rate, while
three-month interest rates remain nearly 2 percentage points above the
intervention level.
Dealers said such huge quantities of French funds were removed from the
market during last Friday's intervention, that the Bank of France had to add
liquidity before a rate cut became meaningful.
Denmark and Belgium continued to take more active measures to support their
currencies' D-Mark parity, ignoring all thought of easing monetary policy.
The Belgian franc was the victim of a modest attack of selling, falling to a
new low of BFr21.6424 to the D-Mark. Again, the Belgian central bank
intervened in the market to help the currency back to a close of BFr21.33.
The amount of intervention was described by one dealer as being
comparatively modest.
The Danish krone appreciated sharply, ending at DKr3.9750 per D-Mark, having
been as low as DKr4.0467 at one stage. But this was at the cost of Monday's
rise in one-month krone to 25 per cent, which yesterday had overnight
borrowing at 250 per cent.
Spain, however, showed yesterday that a cut in interest rates can help the
currency to appreciate because dealers are prepared to put a higher premium
on economic growth than interest rate returns.
The Bank of Spain reduced its repo rate from 11 per cent to 10 1/2 per cent,
which led to a sharp rally in the peseta from Pta83.17 per D-Mark to a close
of Pta81.48 in London.
Sterling was mostly unmoved by yesterday's events, closing a pfennig up at
DM2.5650. But the dollar continued to fall sharply, finishing more than a
pfennig down on the day at DM1.7050. In New York the US currency ended
trading at DM1.7075.
Dealers speculated that the pressure on the dollar may result from selling
of the currency by central banks which will need to repay the Bundesbank
with D-Marks for its help with intervention.

FT  04 AUG 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: US rain-starved crops wilt in
heat - Drought in America's south-east is untimely
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARBARA HARRISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHILE THE Midwest, America's agricultural heartland, is awash with flood
waters, farmers in the south-east are struggling with severe drought and
blistering heat. And, with little relief from the dryness and high
temperatures in sight over the next few months, agricultural losses in the
region are likely to mount.
Georgia's governor, Mr Zell Miller, who toured drought-stricken parts of his
state last week warned: 'All indications are that these conditions will
continue to worsen'.
The drought area stretches from Virginia southward through Georgia and
westward across Alabama and Mississippi.
In the worst hit states of North Carolina, South Carolina and Georgia,
rainfall has been below normal for three months, according to the US
Department of Agriculture. Temperatures in much of the area have recently
been averaging around 38`C (100`F).
'Crops are being very severely stressed,' says one USDA meteorological
official. It says conditions for poultry and livestock are adverse. The
three worst-hit states are significant producers of maize, soyabeans,
tobacco, cotton, and peanuts as well as poultry and livestock.
The drought, considered the worst since 1986, combined with heat over the
past month or so has worsened growing conditions at crucial times for crops.
Soyabeans, for example, were at a critical moment for blooms in the second
half of July, and cotton, which is normally at least knee high in July, was
flowering just six inches off the ground.
'It is very definitely untimely,' says Mr Ray Motha, an official at the
USDA.
Agricultural losses have already risen to such calamitous levels that the
governors of North Carolina, South Carolina and Georgia have requested that
Washington declare part or all of their states federal disaster areas. The
designation would allow farmers to receive low interest government loans and
other emergency aid.
The Dollars 4.3bn flood relief bill pending in congress would help drought
victims and farmers affected by the floods.
The drought has attracted attention of Farm Aid, a private group that
provides relief donations to farmers. On July 30, country music star Mr
Willie Nelson presented a Dollars 10,000 cheque to a federation of southern
farming co-operatives.
In South Carolina, especially suffering in the dryness and heat, estimates
of agricultural losses are already running above Dollars 200m (Pounds 134m).
The figure represents 17 per cent of the state's annual total Dollars 1.2bn
in agricultural production, according to South Carolina's Department of
Agriculture.
One farmer in the western part of the state says his land had not seen rain
between May 10 and July 20.
Georgia estimates its losses at Dollars 500m and North Carolina puts its
losses so far at Dollars 100m.
Overall, maize and soyabeans are the most affected crops in the three
states, followed by tobacco, cotton, peanuts, the forage crops of hay and
pastures, chickens, hogs and cattle.
In North Carolina 57 per cent of the maize crop is in poor or very poor
condition, while in South Carolina and Georgia 95 per cent and 46 per cent,
respectively, of the maize crop is calculated to have been lost. In South
Carolina, 58 per cent of the 505,000 acre soyabean crop is in poor or very
poor shape, and in Georgia 48 per cent of the soyabean crop is in poor or
very poor condition.
A remarkable 75 per cent of the cotton crop in South Carolina is reported in
poor or very poor condition, and a quarter of the Georgia crop is rated
similarly, according to the USDA weekly crop report.
The south-east, which is the largest US chicken-raising area, has not yet
reported region-wide figures on birds lost. But some 1.8m birds have died in
South Carolina and another 300,000 in Georgia. Ms Mary Clouse, editor of
Poultry Grower News in Pittsboro, North Carolina, called the regional losses
'enormous'.
The region is not expected to see much relief from the grueling heat and
dryness in the coming weeks, according to the US National Weather Service.
In its 90-day forecast, issued on July 30, the agency said the region had a
55 per cent probability of above normal temperatures. And it would only make
a 50-50 guess that the area would see relatively normal rainfall over the
next 30 days.
For some crops, rain over the next month could bring recovery. A fresh
measure of the losses will come on August 11 when the USDA's crop report is
expected to indicate how adversely yields will have been affected.

FT  04 AUG 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: MG denies being caught in a
tight LME copper market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
METALLGESELLSCHAFT, the German metals group, yesterday vehemently denied
rumours that, along with some of its big customers, it was on the wrong end
of the squeeze in the London Metal Exchange's copper market.
'It is wrong to assume that MG or its customers can be squeezed,' said an
official.
Although two customers and one MG company had sold copper short (sold in the
expectation that the price would fall) 'every ounce short has been delivered
or will be delivered', the company said.
Nevertheless, MG has urged clients to be cautious because of a possibility
that the squeeze might become tighter in October.
Conditions in the copper market have twice led the LME board to give a
warning that it would take any action necessary to maintain order.
The MG official suggested that the latest warning could be interpreted as a
message about not selling copper short unless able to deliver.
The extreme technical tightness in the market has eased only slightly since
the latest LME warning last week.
Yesterday the backwardation (premium for metal for immediate delivery)
slipped to Dollars 9 a tonne compared with Dollars 17 last week.
Analysts suggested the drop was likely to be related to options declarations
today.
Mr Yasuo Hamanaka, deputy general manager of Sumitomo Corporation's
non-ferrous metals department, said earlier this week that, contrary to any
market rumours, no organisation was manipulating the copper market to drive
prices upward.
He pointed to the steep fall in prices in May and suggested that many market
participants had been building big short positions during the past few
months. Recent covering of those short positions had pushed up prices, he
said.
Other traders suggested that North American copper producers had sold short
but were well able to cope with any squeeze - which might not be the case
for organisations that granted options during the copper price collapse in
May.
In spite of the battering some trading houses suffered then, when the copper
price fell by 25 per cent in five weeks, and any punishment that might be
suffered from the coming squeeze, there have been no suggestions of LME
traders facing financial difficulties of a kind which might have an impact
on the exchange.
Mr David King, chief executive, said that 'the market is deeper, more
liquid, more professional and has many more checks and balances' than it had
10 years ago.

A firm New York opening enabled the London robusta COFFEE market to shrug
off an early setback and back towards the 2 1/2 -year highs achieved on
Monday. The November position slipped to Dollars 1,065 a tonne during the
morning as fears of further frost in Brazilian growing areas receded. But
amid quiet trading the price recovered to close at Dollars 1,085 a tonne, up
Dollars 9 on the day. Although London COCOA prices continued to be held back
by sterling's strength the market managed to add a couple of pounds to
recent gains. At the London Metal Exchange ALUMINIUM prices built on
Monday's firmness as dealers became more hopeful that the downtrend had
bottomed out. The three months position closed at Dollars 1,241.25 a tonne,
up Dollars 10.75 on the day. GOLD surrendered most of a modest early rise
after the New York opening failed to provide support. The London bullion
market fixed a price of Dollars 404.95 a troy ounce in the morning, but by
the close it was down to Dollars 403.65, up 40 cents on the day. Dealers
suggested that the market may have become a little overbought.

THE MIDWEST floods set off a trading frenzy at the Chicago Board of Trade in
July with the exchange's agricultural futures and options turnover hitting a
record 5.5m contracts.
Soyabean futures volume was up 76 per cent over the same month last year and
maize turnover was up 60 per cent. Options volumes in both commodities
doubled.
The exchange as a whole had its third busiest July on record at 16m
contracts. In spite of falling interest rates, CBoT financial futures and
options volumes were up only 4.8 per cent in July at 10.5m contracts.
Ten-year treasury notes saw the largest percentage gains.
Volume at neighbouring Chicago Mercantile Exchange reached a July record of
11.7m contracts, led by 5.6m in Eurodollar futures turnover.
In spite of the currency turmoil in the European Community, CME currency
futures and options volume was down 8 per cent from July 1992 at 2.9m
contracts.
For the first seven months of the year CBoT volume was 87.2m contracts, up
11.2 per cent from 1992. The CME year to date volume was close behind at
8.5m, up 9.2 per cent from last year.

FT  04 AUG 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Profit dive for non-ferrous
metals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NON-FERROUS metals industry put up its worst financial performance for
10 years in 1992, according to the Metals &amp; Minerals Research Services
consultancy group. 'If 1991's results were poor, those for 1992 verged on
the disastrous,' it said.
Its analysis showed net profits of 184 publicly-quoted corporations, after
all taxes and charges, virtually disappeared last year, falling from Dollars
2.9bn in 1991 to only Dollars 38m.
At 5.8 per cent, last year's aggregate return on capital employed by MMRS's
sample of mineral producers was below 5.9 per cent of 1982 and the worst
recorded in 16 years.
Return on shareholders' equity, however, nil last year, was not quite as
poor as the -0.1 per cent seen in 1982.
Debt was also on the increase last year, and gearing, which had stood at
39.6 per cent in 1990 reached 43.7 per cent in 1992, the worst figure
recorded by MMRS.
Companies cut back on capital expenditure, which was reduced from 12.2 per
cent of sales to 11.1 per cent, but spending on exploration and research and
development remained at 2.1 per cent.
MMRS pointed out that the bottom-line or net profits were badly affected by
two new accounting standards widely adopted in the US last year: SFAS 109
(which relates to the calculation of deferred tax liabilities) and SFAS 106
(which states that balance sheets should show accrued liabilities for
post-retirement benefits other than pensions).
The standards virtually wiped out the industry's profits - MMRS's regional
analysis shows that in the US aggregate net earnings of Dollars 546m in 1991
became net losses of Dollars 2.55bn last year.
The research showed the industry's operating costs were kept under control
in 1992 and fell from an aggregate Dollars 151bn to Dollars 148bn, even
though production was rising.

FT  04 AUG 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Nymex submits a Dollars 50m
takeover offer for Comex
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NEW York Mercantile Exchange has submitted a Dollars 50m offer for the
New York commodity exchange in a deal that could merge the world's largest
energy market with the largest precious metals exchange.
The deal would distribute Dollars 30m to the Comex's 772 members at closing
and Dollars 20m to be paid in Dollars 5m tranches over four years.
To placate its own 785 members Nymex directors are also proposing to
distribute Dollars 15m among them if the Comex deal is completed. Another
Dollars 4,000 per lease or Dollars 1m will be paid to traders who rent Nymex
memberships.
The Nymex, with its highly successful oil contracts, has accumulated
retained earnings estimated in excess of Dollars 80m.
Comex first entertained takeover bids in January after its seat prices faded
to Dollars 42,500 following three years of declining volume.
The Chicago Board of Trade offered to pick up the flagging exchange for free
in January, in exchange for administrative cost-cutting.
The 1993 gold rally has since made the Comex a more glittering prize. Seat
prices have rocketed to Dollars 90,000 and volume in July topped 2m
contracts.
July gold futures volume at the Comex was 1.171m contracts, compared with
734,643 in 1992. July silver turnover more than doubled to 503,935 compared
to 197,946 a year ago.
If the Comex accepts the Nymex as a cash offer the exchange will become a
subsidiary of Nymex, with its own governing committee.
Nymex members would gain personal trading rights to any of the new metals
contracts, while Comex members would be able to trade Nymex's platinum and
palladium futures and gain limited rights to trade any new energy contracts.
Comex's contracts are expected to be added to the Nymex's electronic trading
system, Access.
The exchange's clearing and trade processing systems would be integrated
under the plan, with cost savings to both exchanges.
If the Comex board approves the deal, it would be brought to a vote of the
full memberships in late October or early November.

FT  04 AUG 93 / Government Bonds: Spain surges as German repo rate cut
boosts Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB and PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE BUNDESBANK'S unexpected decision to cut its repo rate early yesterday
provided a welcome boost for European government bond markets. It added to
the general optimism that interest rates will fall across the continent now
the straightjacket of the European exchange rate mechanism has been
loosened.
The high-yielding Mediterranean markets showed the strongest gains, with
Spanish bonds charging ahead on the back of a half-point cut in Spanish
interest rates.
The Bank of Spain cut its benchmark interest rate from 11 per cent to 10.5
per cent at its regular seven-to-12-day repurchase tender in the morning.
Despite the cut, the peseta strengthened against the D-Mark, moving from
83.15 pesetas to the mark to 81.76 pesetas by mid-afternoon.
Spanish 10-year yield spreads over Germany have narrowed from around 370
basis points before the EC weekend agreement to switch to wider fluctuation
bands, to a low of 323 basis points yesterday.
GERMAN government bonds gained nearly half a point yesterday, prompted by
the Bundesbank's decision to slice 15 basis points off its repo rate. The
move leaves the repo rate at 6.80 per cent, only 5 basis points above the
discount rate of 6.75 per cent.
Some market participants had expected the Bundesbank to leave key interest
rates unchanged after last week's cut in the Lombard rate - at least until
council members return from holiday on August 26. Dealers saw some switching
out of 10-year French government bonds into higher-yielding 10-year bunds
given that French yields were trading 10 to 12 basis points through their
German equivalents.
The terms were set on a new 10-year bund issue yesterday. Dealers said the
coupon of 6.5 per cent was in line with expectations. The issue price was
100.90 giving an issue yield of 6.38 per cent. The new issue is expected to
raise about DM10bn in total.
THE Banque de France held its interest rates unchanged again, confounding
those in the market who were hoping to see some signs of easing now the
franc has more freedom to move within the 'new-look' exchange rate
mechanism.
The central bank's failure to cut rates led to a fall in prices at the short
end of the curve, but long-dated issues continued to rally with the yield on
the 6 3/4 per cent OAT due 2003 falling from 6.41 per cent to 6.38 per cent.
'French bonds rallied on the back of the German repo cut although this was
followed by profit-taking as there is some concern about the pace at which
the French central bank will ease,' said Mr Philip Tyson, European economist
at Yamaichi International.
INTEREST rate euphoria over much of Europe helped to lift the UK government
bond market, even though sterling cut free of the European ERM last
September.
The index-linked sector benefitted from strong demand, gaining nearly half a
point, and long-dated conventional gilts jumped  3/4 of a point on the day.
The Bank of England said two of its recently announced tap stocks were sold
out yesterday - a Pounds 500m tranche of 7 1/4 per cent stock due 1998 and a
Pounds 300m tranche of index-linked stock due 2020.
US TREASURY prices rose across the board yesterday on hopes that a final
agreement on President Bill Clinton's budget will soon be reached.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  5/16 at 107
23/32 , yielding 6.529 per cent. At the short end, the two-year note was up
1/16 at 100 5/32, to yield 4.151 per cent.
US government securities, already stronger on overseas markets, opened
firmer across the board, sending the yield on the benchmark 30-year bond
close to its all-time low.
The bulk of the increase was attributable to rising hopes among investors
and dealers that Mr Clinton's deficit-reduction budget package would be
approved by Congress before the week was out. The bond market sees the
president's budget as the first serious attempt by a US administration to
tackle the country's huge federal budget deficit.
Sentiment was also aided by the unexpectedly weak 0.1 per cent increase in
the June index of leading economic indicators. The data suggested that the
economy, while not necessarily contracting, is certainly not growing
especially rapidly.

FT  04 AUG 93 / International Capital Markets: Mexico will take to the road
with toll-backed notes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE MEXICAN government is set to issue its first bonds backed by the
revenues of a state-owned toll road. If next month's offering is well
received, the government plans to securitise more of the Dollars 10bn-worth
of private toll road concessions owned by national banks and construction
companies.
The government is preparing to offer around Dollars 600m of
dollar-denominated bonds backed by the peso revenues from the state-owned
toll road linking Mexico City to Cuernavaca, a senior official said.
The debt is likely to be placed in the US with qualified institutions under
the Securities and Exchange Commission's rule 144a, and to be sold publicly
in the rest of the world.
The Cuernavaca toll road was opened in the 1950s and traffic flow is stable.
The Dollars 600m is estimated to be less than the full value of the road,
giving bondholders added security if revenues are less than expected.
The government is apparently not planning to offer any credit or exchange
rate guarantees for the Cuernavaca bonds, but intends to issue different
classes of debt, enabling investors to choose their level of risk. Lehman
Brothers and Banamex are expected to manage the offering.
The Cuernavaca bonds will probably be followed by Grupo ICA's securitisation
of completed parts of the Dollars 540m Guadalajara-Tepic toll road. In this
case, the government is exploring ways of helping ICA reduce exchange rate
risk, perhaps by giving the issuer the right to borrow dollars from the
state development bank in the event of a peso devaluation, one government
official said.
Mexico's privately-financed toll road programme is believed to be the
largest in the world, with some 2,700km of roads completed, and 1,900km
under construction.
However, many roads have run into trouble because traffic has fallen below
forecasts and costs have rocketed. Mexico's banks, which financed most of
the construction, are thought to have been left with hundreds of millions of
dollars of under-performing debt.
The government was forced to postpone a planned offering of highway-backed
bonds last year due to the fall in the Mexican stock market and rise in
interest rates.
If the government successfully sells bonds on the Cuernavaca road, it plans
to offer more backed by revenues from its other toll roads, Mexico City to
Puebla and Mexico City to Queretero.
Tribasa, another construction company, also intends to securitise some of
its Mexico City toll roads in the autumn, after its planned initial public
offering on the New York Stock Exchange in September.
ICA, GMD, another construction company, and Tribasa also plan to securitise
the first part of the Dollars 1bn Mexico City-Guadalajara road.
The only previous toll road bond offering, sold last year and backed by
Tribasa's completed Toluca highway, did not attract much initial interest,
although Lehman Bros says the entire Dollars 312m of bonds have now been
placed.
The transport ministry is trying to sort out problems in finished toll
roads, by extending concessions, and requiring trucks over a certain weight
to use the toll roads.
Officials say traffic on a few roads, generally those far from large cities,
is so low that equity and debt holders will have to inject more capital.
The existing commitments to under-performing toll roads have made Mexico's
banks, except Banamex, unwilling to finance new projects.
The government has said it will pay for the Dollars 600m Tehuacan-Oaxaca
road, and another toll road in Chiapas out of proceeds from privatisation
not accounted for in this year's budget. It hopes Banamex will finance the
Tuxpan-Pachuca toll road.

FT  04 AUG 93 / International Bonds: IADB in Dollars 500m offer after tough
mandate bidding
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Inter-American Development Bank yesterday launched a Dollars 500m
offering of 10-year bonds after a round of competitive bidding for the
mandate which some dealers felt had led to the issue being priced rather
aggressively.
The 10-year bonds were priced to yield 20 basis points over the 10-year US
Treasury yield, but by the end of trading the bonds were bid at 23 basis
points over the curve. However, dealers said a substantial portion of the
issue had been sold at a spread of 20 basis points.
Three other underwriters had also submitted bids to the IADB at a spread of
20 basis points, and a fourth had bid even more aggressively at 19 basis
points.
Lead-manager Merrill Lynch said the issue had prompted some switching out of
outstanding issues by Sweden and LKB Baden-Wurttemburg.
Also in the dollar market, Ford Motor Credit launched a Dollars 300m issue
of floating rate notes due 1998, which dealers said was too tightly priced.
The notes pay interest at 30 basis points over the London interbank offered
rate (Libor), which represents an all-in cost to the borrower of about 35
basis points over Libor.
Lead-manager Morgan Stanley said there was strong demand for floating-rate
dollar debt as some investors want to be protected against potential rises
in interest rates. It added that Ford was a much improved credit.
However, while other dealers agreed there was considerable interest in
floating-rate notes, the pricing of 30 basis points over Libor was 5 to 10
basis points too aggressive, according to some dealers.
They pointed out that if Ford were to borrow in the fixed rate market and
swap the proceeds into floating-rate funding, the company would not be able
to achieve a similar cost of funds.
However, Morgan Stanley reported strong demand from European money market
funds. Banks, which are traditional buyers of floating-rate notes, do not
tend to buy corporate paper because under Basle capital rules corporate debt
carries a 100 per cent risk weighting.
In the Japanese equity-linked sector, Trans Cosmos launched a small Dollars
100 four-year issue of bonds with warrants, which surprised the market with
the strength of its performance. By the end of the day, the bonds with
warrants were bid at 105, a five-point premium to their par issue price.
Lead-manager Nikko Europe said there had been particularly strong demand
because the company had not previously issued equity warrants.
Further, Trans Cosmos, a computer software company, is only listed on the
second section of the Japanese stock market, which is notoriously illiquid.
Consequently, some investors interested in the stock may have avoided buying
it in the cash market, but jumped at the chance to buy the warrants.
Nikko reported some demand from US offshore fund managers.

A SHARP increase in the asset base and a lower tax rate helped Standard Bank
Investment Corporation (Stanbic), South Africa's leading banking group, to
increase earnings per share 37 per cent, to 335 from 245 cents, in the six
months to June.
The group, however, stressed this rate of growth did not accurately reflect
the underlying operating environment. It would not continue in the second
half.
Mr Eddie Theron, managing director, said the 23 per cent increase in the
asset base, to R65.2bn (Dollars 19.4bn) from R53bn, had helped boost the
results. South African assets rose 16 per cent to R61.2bn (R52.5bn), coming
almost entirely from growth in home loans.
UK assets - Standard has established a branch in London - rose to R1.97bn
from R551m, and other African assets increased to R1.4bn from nothing
following the acquisition last year of ANZ Grindlays African operations.
Rights issue proceeds of R650m boosted assets further.
The reduction in the corporate tax rate, to 40 per cent from 48 per cent,
added 27 cents per share to earnings. Mr Theron said the earnings figures
also flattered because they came off a comparatively low base in 1992.
Although net interest income rose 23.6 per cent, to R1.46bn from R1.18bn,
this was insufficient to compensate for the 27.3 per cent increase in bad
debt provisions.

<TEXT>
BEAR STEARNS, the Wall Street securities house, yesterday announced a 58 per
cent increase in fiscal fourth-quarter profits to Dollars 124.8m, or Dollars
1.07 a share.
The strong final quarter took the firm's full-year earnings to a record
Dollars 362.4m, well up on the Dollars 294.6m reported for the previous 12
months. Bear Stearns' revenues in the fourth quarter, excluding interest
expense, were Dollars 681.7m, and for the year Dollars 2.1bn.
Bear Stearns said its record quarter and year reflected significant
increases in revenues in most of its main business lines, echoing the
performance of other Wall Street firms. It also reaped record profits in the
wake of strong investor demand for equities and a booming stock and bond
underwriting business.
Revenues from principal transactions - the trading of securities for the
firm's own account - rocketed to Dollars 362m in the quarter, from Dollars
248m a year ago. The large increase was primarily derived from high levels
of activity in the trading of fixed-income instruments.
Investment banking, Bear Stearns' second-largest revenue-earner behind
interest and dividend income, brought in Dollars 136m between April and
June, well ahead of the Dollars 90m a year ago. Commission revenues,
meanwhile, advanced 31 per cent to Dollars 118m, due partly to a strong
performance from the firm's correspondent clearing and private client
services divisions.
Total non-interest expenses were also up sharply, rising 38 per cent to
Dollars 470m, an increase that was in line with the growth in business
activity.
News of the record quarter and year failed to lift the share price, which
edged Dollars  5/8 lower to Dollars 24 3/4 before at the close in New York.
The stock had opened close to its all-time high, and the modest decline was
attributable to profit-taking, rather than disappointment in the firm's
earnings.

FT  04 AUG 93 / International Company News: Falling prices hit Kaiser
Aluminum
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FALLING aluminium prices and lower output drove Kaiser Aluminum deeper into
the red in the second quarter, writes Richard Waters. Net loss per share on
ordinary operations rose to 34 cents from 29 cents in the first three
months.
'The continued weakness of market prices for most all aluminium products',
was partly to blame for a fall in turnover, to Dollars 432.2m from Dollars
490.9m a year ago, Mr Stephens Hutchcraft, chairman, said . Turnover for the
first half was down to Dollars 874.8m from Dollars 954.6m.
The company suffered a net loss of Dollars 19.4m, compared with a deficit
(before an extraordinary charge and accounting changes) of Dollars 16.6m in
the first three months. Year-ago net income totalled Dollars 12m, or 21
cents. The net loss of Dollars 36m in the first half compared with a net
profit of Dollars 20.4m.
Aluminium prices averaged 51 cents a pound in the second quarter, 8 cents
lower than in the same period in 1992.
The company has not brought back to full capacity two plants in the
north-west, partly as a result of lower prices.
The timing of shipments also reduced the volumes of aluminium and other
products sent.

PRUDENTIAL, the US insurance group, plans to sell most of its remaining 20
per cent stake in Dr Pepper/Seven-Up, the US soft drinks maker that was the
subject of a leveraged buy-out in 1998, writes Richard Waters in New York.
On yesterday's closing share price in New York, of Dollars 17 3/4 - down
Dollars  3/4 following the news - the deal would realise the Prudential
Dollars 195m before fees.
The sale of 11m shares will be through an underwritten secondary offering,
with 8.8m shares offered in the US and the rest internationally.
The Prudential said the disposal was in line with its normal policy of
realising investment gains in the medium term. 'Generally, we like to be
involved for around five years,' it said.
The insurer invested Dollars 600m in the Dr Pepper buy-out, in the process
taking a 49 per cent interest. All but 20 per cent has been disposed of
already, the Prudential said. After the latest sale, the company plans to
retain just under 2 per cent of the company's stock.
Dr Pepper went public in January.

<TEXT>
GENERAL Reinsurance, the largest US reinsurer, recorded second-quarter net
income of Dollars 183.8m, or Dollars 2.14 a share, up from Dollars 158.5m,
or Dollars 1.80, a year ago.
The growth in General Re's earnings stemmed from lower claims and expenses,
an improvement in the company's underwriting results, and a modest rise in
investment income.
The strong second quarter took the Connecticut-based reinsurer's six-month
earnings to Dollars 344.4m, down from the Dollars 366.3m recorded in the
first half of 1992. Last year's six-monthly results, however, were boosted
by a one-off gain of Dollars 61m from an accounting adjustment.
General Re's worldwide net premium volume in the quarter climbed 3.2 per
cent to Dollars 588.4m, due primarily to a 42 per cent jump in international
reinsurance premium volume. Net investment income totalled Dollars 193.8m
over the three months, up from Dollars 187.9m a year ago.
Total revenues reached Dollars 843.4m, up from Dollars 829.2m in the second
quarter of 1992.
Claims and claim expenses totalled Dollars 397.4m, compared with Dollars
427.8m a year ago, and overall expenses shrank by 3.3 per cent to Dollars
608.4m.
Yesterday's results were announced after the stock market had closed.
General Re shares finished the day at Dollars 123, up Dollars 2 and close to
their 52-week high.

FT  04 AUG 93 / International Company News: Cash triggers Iridium countdown
 -Motorola's satellite project has taken the lead
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMPANIES from three continents this week threw their weight and credibility
behind the world's biggest private-sector aerospace project.
They have invested Dollars 100m in cash and promised another Dollars 700m as
the first stage in financing Iridium, a Dollars 3.4bn satellite-based global
mobile telephone network.
Another five consortia have planned similar schemes since the late 1980s.
This, however, is the first time hard cash has replaced mere blueprints.
Motorola, the originator of Iridium, has a clear lead over competitors,
including US aerospace companies Loral, TRW and Fairchild; France's Matra,
Aerospatiale and Alcatel; Deutsche Aerospace; Matra-Marconi, the
Anglo-French joint venture; Italy's Alenia; and Inmarsat, the 69-member
international co-operative that operates satellites for mobile
communications.
Motorola's success promises to trigger a race between the contenders to
establish infrastructures. Not only are there limits to the world's
satellite launching capacity, but the size of the market may mean there is
room for just two competitors.
Each of the rival projects is breathtaking in scale. Iridium, for example,
plans to launch 66 small telecommunications satellites in the two years
between 1996 and 1998. The rockets will be launched from the US on the
McDonnell Douglas Delta rocket, from Russia on the Proton Rocket, and China
on the Long March.
The network will carry telephone calls, fax messages, paging, facsimile,
computer data and radio-determination satellite services (RDSS), which
locate telephones by latitude and longitude.
Iridium hopes to attract 1.5m customers - between 1.5 and 2 per cent of the
number of cellular telephone users - by the end of the century.
Each customer will have to buy one of two types of telephone. The first will
work only with Iridium, and the second will work with both Iridium and the
buyer's own local mobile telephone network.
Mr John Mitchell, a vice-chairman of Motorola, said these would sell at
about 40 per cent more than ordinary cellular telephone handsets.
Motorola's business plan specifies charges of about Dollars 3 a minute.
Although this is more expensive than ordinary cellular telephones now, they
are cheaper than the Dollars 10 a minute charged for satellite calls made
from aircraft.
Pricing is a crucial issue. 'Our service should be cheaper and with a
service quality as good as, or superior, to that proposed by Iridium,' said
Mr Jai Singh, executive vice-president at London-based Inmarsat, which hopes
to have its scheme financed after February 1994.
Although any service Inmarsat established would be similar to Iridium's on
paper, customers are likely to notice significant differences because of the
way the infrastructures are built.
Motorola has designed a network based on 66 small satellites orbiting not
far above the earth's surface. Inmarsat, on the other hand, abandoned the
principle of a low-earth orbit (Leo) network just last week in favour of
fewer satellites placed in higher orbits.
As a result, Inmarsat's telephones may have to be larger to transmit their
messages further. Or it could use tested technologies, which it says need
only Dollars 1bn to set up.
Motorola is taking a risk by breaking new ground in its design. Moreover, a
network of 66 satellites will be inherently more complicated than one with
fewer, such as Inmarsat's. Two further obstacles remain for Motorola: money
and government approval.
This week's Dollars 800m tranche will be followed within two years by
another of almost equal size. The remaining 60 per cent of the money needed
will come from the debt market, says Goldman Sachs, Motorola's adviser.
Regulatory problems remain less clear. Motorola only has experimental
approval from the US Federal Communications Commission, while a European
Commission report on Leo satellite networks in December 1992 said it would
take at least another five years to answer regulatory and other questions.
Hard heads in the international debt markets are likely to want to see
regulatory approval from both sides of the Atlantic before happily handing
over almost Dollars 2bn.

at Stanbic
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
A SHARP increase in the asset base and a lower tax rate helped Standard Bank
Investment Corporation (Stanbic), South Africa's leading banking group, to
increase earnings per share 37 per cent, to 335 from 245 cents, in the six
months to June.
The group, however, stressed that this rate of growth did not accurately
reflect the underlying operating environment. It would not continue in the
second half. A 'satisfactory improvement' in earnings, however, was
anticipated for the full year.
Mr Eddie Theron, managing director, said the 23 per cent increase in the
asset base, to R65.2bn (Dollars 19.4bn) from R53bn, had helped boost the
results. South African assets increased by 16 per cent to R61.2bn (R52.5bn),
coming almost entirely from growth in home loans.
UK assets - Standard has established a branch in London - rose to R1.97bn
from R551m, and other African assets increased to R1.4bn from nothing
following the acquisition last year of ANZ Grindlays African operations.
Rights issue proceeds of R650m boosted assets further.
The reduction in the corporate tax rate, to 40 per cent from 48 per cent,
added 27 cents per share to earnings. Mr Theron said the earnings figures
also flattered because they came off a comparatively low base in 1992.
Although net interest income rose 23.6 per cent, to R1.46bn from R1.18bn, Mr
Theron noted this was insufficient to compensate for the 27.3 per cent
increase in bad debt provisions to R220.2m, from R173m last time.
On an annualised basis, this represents 0.68 per cent of total assets, up
from 0.33 per cent in 1988.
Other operating income rose to R845.4m from R702.9m. Attributable income
rose 57 per cent to R398m from R253.1m. The dividend was increased to 62
cents from 53 cents per share.

FT  04 AUG 93 / International Company News: Write-down hurts Canadian
Pacific
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MONTREAL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CANADIAN Pacific, the transport, resource and property group, yesterday
reported disappointing second-quarter results, but remained firmly in the
black for the first half.
Its second quarter was hurt by its share of a USDollars 120m write-down by
Laidlaw, the waste management affiliate, and by slow recovery in the rail,
road and sea transport units.
These factors were largely offset by 87 per cent-owned PanCanadian
Petroleum, the oil and natural gas producer, which doubled its profit in the
first half with gains in output.
Its first-half contribution to CP was CDollars 160m (USDollars 125m), or
twice that of the transport units, compared with Dollars 98.3m in the first
half of 1992.
CP's second-quarter profit was CDollars 12m, or 3 cents a share, after a 5
cents write-down for Laidlaw, while total operating income before interest,
taxes and minority interests was CDollars 191m, against CDollars 151.6m.
This excludes the Laidlaw rightdown.
Net income was CDollars 21m, or 6 cents, a year earlier.
Six months' net profit was CDollars 33.7m, or 10 cents, against a loss of
CDollars 18.7m, or 6 cents, on total revenue of CDollars 4bn, down from
CDollars 4.8bn, due to de-consolidation of CP's interests in Unitel, the
telecommunications group, and United Dominion, a US industrial products
group. Excluding this factor, revenues were up CDollars 213m.
Operating income was CDollars 285.2m against CDollars 213m.
CP Rail's contribution declined because of lower coal and grain shipments in
the first quarter. However, grain recovered sharply in the second quarter,
as did coal and potash. CP Ships gained from stronger container traffic and
better rates and CP Trucks reduced its losses.
Pan Canadian benefited from two years of heavy investment. It expects higher
shipment of oil and gas in the second half, offsetting lower oil prices.
Fording Coal gained from higher shipments and selling prices and a lower
dollar. CP Forest reduced its losses with stronger markets for wood products
and newsprint.
Marathon Realty was sharply lower because of lower land sales and higher
vacancy rates in office buildings and shopping centres. CP Hotels improved
with better occupancy and room rates.

Dollars 88m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CIGNA, one of the US's largest insurers, reported a sharp reduction in
earnings in the second quarter, caused by losses in its general commercial
insurance business and reduced investment gains.
Post-tax profits were Dollars 88m, or Dollars 1.22 a share, down from
Dollars 130m, or Dollars 1.81, a year ago. First-half net income fell to
Dollars 134m, from Dollars 237m, before the effect of accounting changes.
The general commercial business, which covers property/casualty risks for
medium-sized US companies, suffered from poor underwriting and pressure on
premium rates, the company said. It added that the senior management of this
part of its business had been replaced earlier this year and it had reduced
its involvement in the area.
As a result, Cigna's property/casualty division reported losses of Dollars
79m (before after-tax investment gains of Dollars 34m), compared with a loss
of Dollars 55m (before gains of Dollars 41m) the year before.
The escalating losses came in spite of a marked fall in catastrophe losses,
which were Dollars 15m pre-tax, compared with Dollars 55m.
Net income from the employee life and health benefits area on the other hand
climbed to Dollars 104m (before after-tax investment gains of Dollars 7m)
from Dollars 67m (before gains of Dollars 30m).
Net income from employee retirement and savings benefits fell by Dollars 2m
to Dollars 36m, due to an Dollars 8m investment loss.

Turnover was down 2.4 per cent to SDollars 728.7m from SDollars 746.6m.
Keppel's core shipbuilding and repair business in Singapore suffered from a
generally weak global market. Improved revenues have come from non-shipping
activities and the group's rapidly-expanding overseas interests.
Offshore ship and rig building activities improved.

CREDITANSTALT-Bankverein, Austria's second-largest bank, has achieved a
substantial recovery in profit in the first half and plans to sell off most
of its industrial holdings. In last year's group balance sheet, its
investment portfolio was valued at Sch24.3bn (Dollars 2.02bn).
Mr Guido Schmidt-Chiari, chairman, said that the 77 per cent jump in
first-half pre-tax profits to Sch2.3bn was due mainly to very good trading
results, cost-cutting and the weak result in the first half of last year. He
promised at least a partial restoration of its annual dividend after last
year's 60 per cent cut.
The bank, which was the subject of an unfriendly takeover bid last spring,
hoped that at least some of the Austrian government's controlling
shareholding could soon be placed with institutional investors.
Creditanstalt shares have been among the strongest and most active on the
Vienna bourse this year.
The chairman said that following the sell-off of industrial holdings, the
bank would retain only minority stakes of strategic value.
Mr Peter Szopo, head of equity research at GiroCredit Bank in Vienna,
estimated that the unstated surplus value in Creditanstalt's industrial
portfolio was about Sch4bn. He suspected that the disposals would take at
least five years, with some sales raising concern about foreign
participation.
At the end of 1992, Creditanstalt held, among other things, 74.3 per cent of
Semperit, tyre maker; 71.2 per cent of Steyr-Daimler-Puch, motor group; 72.5
per cent of Treibacher Chemische Werke; 63.8 per cent of Universale-Bau,
construction group and 59.4 per cent of Wienerberger Baustoffindustrie, the
building materials group.
The bank said its net interest and fee income grew only 8 per cent in the
first half to Sch5.6bn as the margin on schilling business was by and large
unchanged. However, operating expenses grew only 1.1 per cent to Sch4.4bn.
Mr Schmidt-Chiari was confident that the operating result for the year would
be considerably higher, thanks to the rise on the stock market and improving
interest spreads. He cautioned that provisions for bad loans, while notably
lower than last year's Sch5.66bn, would weigh on performance.
The bank said the dividend for 1993 could be increased from last year's 6
per cent.

INVESTOR, the main holding company of Sweden's powerful Wallenberg family,
said yesterday it had sold a 2 per cent stake in Stora, Europe's largest
forestry products company, raising more than SKr600m (Dollars 85.7m) in a
move it described as part of a programme to reduce group debt.
The sale over the past two months of 1.88m Stora A shares followed the
disposal for SKr2.94bn in late June of Investor's 7.4 per cent stake in
Asea, the joint owner of the Swiss-Swedish Asea Brown Boveri engineering
group. Investor raised a further Pounds 23m (Dollars 34.3m) when it sold its
7.5 per cent stake in Christies International, the UK auction house, last
month.
The amounts raised are in line with the scale of debt reduction Investor
signalled earlier this year when it said it intended to bring down group net
borrowings to SKr5bn-SKr6bn. The investment group, which has majority or
leading stakes in many of Sweden's top companies, slipped to a SKr542m loss
in the first quarter. Group net debt stood at SKr9.86bn at March 31.
The Wallenbergs have avoided any significant erosion of their control in
Swedish industry in spite of the trading difficulties.

<TEXT>
POLYGRAM shrugged off the European recession and raised net income by 19 per
cent to Fl 204m (Dollars 107m) in the first half of 1993.
Profits were lifted by the Sting album, Ten Summoner's Tales, which sold
more than 3m copies in the first half. Mr Alain Levy, chief executive, said
an increase in the group's continental European market share had mitigated
the effects of the recession. Sales were strong in Asia Pacific but the
group suffered a small decline in North American market share.
In classical music, the recession and strong price competition resulted in a
slight fall in sales.
Overall, sales rose 6 per cent to Fl 3.2bn. Income from operations was up 18
per cent to Fl 319m. Net income per share rose 19 per cent to Fl 1.20.
Mr Levy said the group had a strong release schedule for the second half,
with new albums from Elton John, U2, Lionel Richie and Stevie Wonder.
PolyGram will be releasing the cast recording of Mr Andrew Lloyd Webber's
London musical Sunset Boulevard. PolyGram has a 30 per cent stake in Mr
Lloyd Webber's Really Useful Holdings.
Last May, Gramercy Pictures, the group's film distribution joint venture in
North America, released its first movie, Posse.

ESSELTE, the Swedish office products group, saw profits after financial
items fall to SKr138m (Dollars 17.5m) in the first six months of the year
from SKr198m in the same 1992 period.
It blamed the 30 per cent fall on weaker demand in its main European markets
and said it was not reaping the full benefits of the rationalisation
programme which it had implemented in the US.
However, the company said the recent turbulence in the foreign exchange
markets, following the virtual collapse of the European exchange rate
mechanism, could turn out to be beneficial for the group.
It manufactures 80 per cent of its office equipment for the European market
in Denmark, France and Belgium, whose currencies are expected to weaken in
the new ERM parameters. 'Our products should be more competitive and we hope
that demand will pick up in a lower interest rate environment,' the company
said.
The group is sticking by an earlier forecast that profits for the full year
will exceed last year's SKr259m.
Sales in the first half climbed to SKr5.70bn from SKr5.00bn thanks to the
devaluation of the Swedish krona.

FT  04 AUG 93 / International Company News: Piech qualifies VW profits
target
</HEADLINE>

   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
VOLKSWAGEN will not reach its break-even target for this year if turnover
falls by more than 5 per cent, according to Mr Ferdinand Piech, group
chairman.
Mr Piech seemed to moderate his claims that VW would break even or possibly
show a profit this year after heavy losses in the first half in an interview
published yesterday.
He said the group's earnings expectations were based on a fall in worldwide
deliveries of 10 per cent to 12 per cent and a 15 per cent drop in Germany.
He reckoned on a 5 per cent fall in group turnover to about DM81bn (Dollars
47.6bn) including a 10 per cent decline at the German parent to about
DM48bn.
'It is clear that our earnings forecast cannot be attained if the drop in
sales is larger,' he added. Mr Piech, talking with officials of the Egon
Zehnder, consulting group, repeated that cost savings of DM8.7bn were mostly
implemented. They would help the group attain the net return on sales of
more than 3 per cent estimated as necessary for a break-even result for
1993.
He expected return on sales to reach 5 per cent to 7 per cent in five years.
Rapid progress was necessary because voluntary Japanese quotas would only
help for two more years. If the European car industry could not match their
performance within that time 'we would have lost anyway', he said.
VW intended to attack the Japanese in the same way as the Swiss watch
industry had: value-for-money Swatch at the bottom end of the market and
good design at the top end. 'The Japanese can be beaten, and we at
Volkswagen have the tools to do it,' he said.
Within six years at the latest, he added, all group factories had to be able
to break even working at 70 per cent of capacity. The current ratio was
between 85 per cent and 90 per cent, he claimed, after 100 per cent and more
last year.
Audi, the group's quality car division, would reach 68 per cent by the end
of this year.

FT  04 AUG 93 / International Company News: Bavarian bank lifted by bad loan
provisions
</HEADLINE>

   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BAYERISCHE Vereinsbank, the Munich-based financial group which has been
expanding in northern and eastern Germany, yesterday announced a 22 per cent
rise in total operating profits to DM528m (Dollars 310m) in the first half
of 1993.
This was after risk provisions on bad loans amounting to DM426m, a rise of 5
per cent. The bank, which controls Vereins-und Westbank in Hamburg, said the
increase reflected the increase in domestic credit risks as a result of
Germany's recession.
The latest accounting period is the first for which German banks have
produced full details of their risk provisions. This comes ahead of an EC
directive requiring such information for the 1993 financial year.
Bayerische Vereinsbank, one of Germany's five leading commercial banks, said
that partial operating profits - these exclude trading on the bank's own
account - were 6 per cent higher at DM792m.
Net interest and commission income both increased, but administrative costs
were 10 per cent higher as a result of continued growth in east Germany,
where Vereinsbank has 74 branches.
All figures are compared with half of the full 1992 result rather than with
the actual January-June period. This is because the bank has only adjusted
last year's total profits, and not the interim results, in line with the new
accounting procedures.
The bank said group profits from trading on its own account more than
doubled to DM150m. Operating profits of the parent bank were 16 per cent
higher at DM334m after a 4 per cent rise in risk provisions to DM275m.
Credit volume at the parent expanded by 5 per cent over the level at the
start of the year to DM124bn.
At group level, credit volume was 4 per cent higher at DM216bn.

ROUSSEL-UCLAF, one of France's largest chemicals companies, yesterday
announced a strong increase in net profits for the first half of the year
and forecast full-year net profits would be between 15 per cent and 20 per
cent higher than the 1992 result.
The company, which is 54 per cent owned by Hoechst, the German chemicals
group, reported net profits of FFr470m (Dollars 81m) for the first six
months of the year.
This represents an increase of 38.5 per cent on the comparable period in
1992 after subtracting exceptional gains from the sale of stakes in
Jouveinal and Laboratories Takeda France.
Roussel-Uclaf said that the strong first-half performance reflected the
impact of cost-cutting measures arising from its restructuring programme.
The programme, which is scheduled to be completed in 1995, involves the
closure of eight factories in Europe.
The group said that productivity had been increased and that average debt
during the first six months of this year was about FFr1bn less than in the
first half of 1992.
The increase in sales largely reflected a strong performance in its human
healthcare business, which raised turnover by about 8 per cent.
However, its agricultural chemicals business only increased sales by 1.2 per
cent in the face of depressed demand, the company said.
The slower growth in net profits expected for the full year, compared with
the first six months, reflects a strong performance in the second half of
1992.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ILVA, the Italian state-owned steelmaker, expects to cut losses to about
L2,000bn (Dollars 1.3bn) this year from L2,309bn in 1992.
Consolidated debts at the company, due to be split and partly privatised,
amounted to about L7,500bn at the end of June, against L7,583bn at the end
of 1992, according to Mr Piero Barucci, Italy's treasury minister.
Addressing a parliamentary committee, Mr Paolo Savona, the industry
minister, said plans for the partial privatisation of Ilva, which is
Europe's fourth-biggest steelmaker, could be ready by mid-September.
The group, controlled by the IRI state holding company, has until recently
been locked in a row with the European Commission, which had blocked a
previous restructuring plan.
Last month, the Italian government and the commission reached a compromise.
The commission extended its deadline for a new re-organisation plan in
return for Italian commitments on swift privatisation and not writing off
outstanding debts.
Meanwhile, discussions have taken place with a number of leading private
sector steelmakers on investing in the big Taranato and Novi Ligure works,
which form the heart of the flat products company.

FT  04 AUG 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOOTSIE futures showed signs of flagging yesterday as the trading range
tightened and turnover fell after hopes of an early cut in European interest
rates dimmed. However, volatility against the underlying market gave dealers
the chance to arbitrage between the two, writes Peter John.
On the Liffe, the contract on the Footsie for September delivery opened at
2,957 and looked vulnerable for a while. At one stage it was down to 2,938,
only two points above the cash market and below fair value, the premium
which compensates for dividends and carrying costs, which is currently at
four points.
After a rally of nine consecutive days in the cash market, buyers were
beginning to be wary, but dealers said they were still attracted by any
dips.
The prospect of interest rate cuts in Europe - which will cut debts,
encourage spending and narrow the yield differential between bonds and
equities - has encouraged buying of French, German and UK shares. The buyers
have seen futures contracts on the markets as the quickest way in.
The Footsie future was only marginally firmer on balance in late trading,
and the day's turnover was less than 10,000.
Traded options volume was low, with around 29,000 lots dealt. The FT-SE 100
option was the most heavily traded, while Asda topped the list of stock
options, followed by RTZ and Ladbroke.

FT  04 AUG 93 / London Stock Exchange: Rally extends to ninth trading
session
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK stock market managed its ninth consecutive daily advance yesterday,
although there were signs that, with the promised interest rate cuts slow to
manifest themselves, the longest rally in the Footsie stocks since before
the 1987 crash was in danger of faltering. Share prices traced a mixed
pattern throughout the session and the closing FT-SE 100 Index gain of 3.3
at 2,945.0 was below the day's best.
Equity traders remained convinced that the ERM is on its way to the
breaker's yard and that interest rates are about to fall throughout Europe;
optimism was enhanced yesterday by an easing in repurchase rates in Germany.
However, the calmer trends in the French equity market underlined acceptance
by investors that interest rate cuts may not come as soon as the optimists
would like. Both Germany and France are likely to resist calls for stringent
rate cuts, according to UK equity analysts.
Trading in equities remained high in London, with the Seaq network recording
turnover of 799.8m shares, against 727.1m on Monday, when retail business,
worth Pounds 1.37bn, was also good. A trading programme of around Pounds
100m was seen in the first half of the session and appeared to reflect a
reshaping of an institutional portfolio towards high yielding stocks.
Pressures on second rank issues brought a further peak in the FT-SE Mid 250
Index, which ended 3.1 higher at 3,338.4. Business in non-Footsie issues
made up 62 per cent of the total Seaq volume, significantly higher than
usual.
Support from a firm UK government bond market buttressed underlying
confidence that equities have further progress ahead of them, and are only
waiting for more solid news on the fate of the ERM and the prospects for
interest rates. Dealers reported that UK funds were still moving cash
towards the other European equity markets and that the steadiness of the UK
market owed a good deal to activity in stock index futures.
Retail and consumer shares, directly hooked on to hopes of lower base rates,
at first extended the gains of the past week, but lost heart as the day
passed without news of any reductions in key rates in the leading ERM
countries.
The international blue chips lacked strength, in spite of a firm performance
from Wall Street overnight. Early in its new session the New York market
showed a dip of 3 points on the Dow Average. Oil shares lacked strength as
sector specialists continued to weigh up the outlook for crude prices, and
the much-battered drug sector remained on the sidelines.
With some analysts now suggesting that Mr Kenneth Clarke, the UK chancellor
of the exchequer, may hold back a base rate cut until his autumn budget, the
strength of sterling became a discouraging factor for the big export stocks.
Indeed, some analysts now fear that a base rate cut is needed to take the
upward pressure off sterling.
But the renewal of optimism in the stock market helped banking shares again
as National Westminster unveiled its profits statement. The sector made some
further recovery from the doubts cast over the past fortnight by warnings
from several UK brokerage houses that the recovery in the sector had been
overdone, causing individual stocks to look overrated against the market.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
STRONG performances by south-east Asian stock markets, particularly Hong
Kong and Indonesia, contributed to a rise of 23.6 per cent in net asset
value at TR Pacific Investment Trust over the six months to June 30.
The figure of 141.7p compared with 114.63p in December and 95.3p a year
earlier.
Net revenue improved to Pounds 370,000 (Pounds 328,000) for earnings of
0.552p (0.49p) per share.
Plans to raise further equity finance have been under consideration since
the beginning of July, but directors said they were not proceeding
immediately.
The proposals will be kept under review.
The trust continues to be optimistic on the region's growth prospects. The
overheating economy in China may have a temporarily adverse effect on
sentiment, but directors see a good outlook for longer term investment.

FT  04 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Unlikely springboard for European growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JAMES BROWN will be the first entertainer not wearing football boots to play
at the New London Stadium.
The veteran soul singer appears at the end of this month by arrangement with
Ogden Entertainment Services of New York, one of the world's biggest
marketing companies.
Ogden, which manages 110 venues in the US and Canada, has found its
springboard to a European stadia operation in New Cross, south London, the
home of Millwall Football Club.
The US group, whose only other European operation is baggage handling at
Gatwick Airport, is at the start of a vigorous European campaign in
entertainments.
Last month it agreed a 20-year contract to operate Manchester's new Olympic
arena and it is in the final throes of arranging a deal concerning a new
stadium in Kirklees, West Yorkshire. Several other projects are under
negotiation including plans for Germany and Belgium as well as further
schemes for the UK.
Mr Frank Russo, Ogden's vice president for international operations, is
excited about the Millwall venture. He is unworried about the club's former
reputation for supporter violence or the ground's location in an area of
south London considered in need of regeneration. 'The area has a reputation
that is based more in perception than truth,' he said.
The link-up between Ogden and Millwall arose from an association between Mr
Peter Mead, vice-chairman of the football club, and chiefs at Ogden. It has
resulted in the 10 year management deal under which Ogden will take full
responsibility for non-football events and take a share in catering and
merchandising.
Mr Russo sees the UK as a market ready to be tapped. Apart from customers
clamouring to be treated 'with more kindness', he also sees potential for
more stadia. 'There needs to be more of a circuit in the UK,' he said.
The foothold Ogden has made at Millwall will soon be consolidated by plans
for a permanent UK base.

FT  04 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Lions roam from Den to seek long-term
safety - Millwall Football Club's move to a new home
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE are too many professional football clubs, believes Mr Reg Burr,
chairman of Millwall. 'You could get rid of about 25 clubs hanging on by
their fingertips.'
Millwall, the first division team, is now not one of them. Tonight the south
London side, owned by USM-quoted Millwall Holdings, opens a Pounds 15.5m
multi-purpose stadium, built - remarkably given the company's Pounds 12m
market value - without recourse to debt.
The company has had a rocky ride on the Stock Exchange and the club has long
been dogged by the reputation for violence of its supporters.
But, Mr Burr reckons, the stadium's inaugural match, between Millwall and Mr
Bobby Robson's Sporting Lisbon, will mark a turning point in the club's
108-year history and one which he thinks will guarantee football at Millwall
for at least 75 years.
Millwall Holdings was floated on the USM in 1989 at 20p a share. It started
trading in profit, but in 1990 a combination of relegation from the then
First Division and an ill-fated foray into the pubs business with the Pounds
10m purchase of Tavern Leisure took their toll.
The company tumbled into loss with a pre-tax deficit of Pounds 2.67m in the
10 months to end of May 1991. Losses have since been cut with the disposal
of the pub chain, but Millwall has yet to return to profits.
The shares now stand at 4 1/4 p.
Even before these troubles, the club had decided it must move to a new
ground if it was to survive.
Now the club, nicknamed the Lions, has left its Den, the old club ground,
much to the demonstrated distress of fans, to roam Senegal Fields, the site
of its new home, New London Stadium.
Although only half a mile down the road, it promises to be a world away from
the old Millwall terraces.
Much of the cash for the new stadium came from the sale of the Den, a Pounds
3.2m rights issue this spring, and grants from the Football Trust and
Lewisham Council, Millwall's local authority.
The Den's sale to Fairview New Homes, the housebuilder, yielded Pounds 5.2m.
The Football Trust awarded a grant of Pounds 2.5m, the largest it has made
to a league side.
This was topped up by an extra allocation by the trust of Pounds 250,000,
made to fund Taylor report requirements. This report, written after the
Hillsborough disaster in 1989, required football clubs to convert their
terraces to seats.
Lewisham Council, long-time sponsors of Millwall, provided Pounds 2.6m. The
stadium includes a community sports hall. The Senegal Fields site is owned
by Lewisham and is on a 125-year lease to Millwall.
Various other sponsorship tie-ups and schemes make up the rest of the
funding. Millwall has struck a 5-year marketing deal with Coca Cola and its
kit will be sponsored by Seagram's International, the drinks group.
But the new ground is not just for football. Mr Burr is keen the stadium
develops a life of its own beyond the football club, producing returns that
will sustain the club's development over the long-term.
The stadium is designed to host pop concerts, boxing, festivals and other
events as well as Millwall matches.
Ogden Entertainment Services will handle all non-football events under in a
10-year arrangement, taking a management fee and a percentage of the food
and beverage sales. Mr Burr is adamant that with non-football events 'we are
not taking a promotional risk'.
He sees such off-field expansion as the only way for football clubs to
prosper as live soccer is an addiction for a diminishing number of people.
It provides another important source of income when clubs are suffering
financial pressures on many sides, including falling gate receipts, rising
transfer fees, and the expense of implementing the Taylor report.
Clubs cannot afford a hand-to-mouth short-term outlook, Mr Burr believes,
painting a grim picture of the failing fortunes of football clubs that is
born from ailing local economies.
'When I first came into football 30 years ago it was all about 11 men
kicking a ball. That was very nice but it isn't like that any more, it can't
be.'

FT  04 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Abtrust Scotland net assets ahead
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Abtrust Scotland Investment, an investment trust which concentrates its
portfolio on unlisted Scottish companies, reported an undiluted net asset
value of 34.3p per share as at May 31, a rise of 6.5 per cent over the year.
Mr Calum Macleod, chairman, said that the trust's net asset value had risen
by 37 per cent over the past five years, against an advance of 12.3 per cent
in the NatWest Securities Venture Capital Nav Index.
A number of companies in the portfolio showed 'outstanding performances' Mr
Macleod said, notably Grampian Television, Aberdeen Trust, John Wood,
Seaforth Maritime, GRT and Scotcare. In contrast, the trust suffered a
significant write-down in the value of its holding in Adam and Company, the
Edinburgh-based private bank which recently disclosed losses of Pounds 21m
in unauthorised treasury transactions.
Reduced dividend income and the early redemption of high-yielding preference
shares by some companies left net revenue sharply lower at Pounds 139,993
(Pounds 258,645), equivalent to earnings of 0.42p (0.77p) per share.
Nevertheless, the dividend is maintained at 0.6p.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Farringford, the former soft drinks manufacturer which now has the
Farringford Hotel on the Isle of Wight as its only active - and profitable -
subsidiary, turned in accounts for the year ended February 28 which it is
anticipated will be qualified on a going concern basis.
The loss for the year was Pounds 655,000 - against a deficit of Pounds 2.29
for the previous 14 months - after exceptional items of Pounds 317,000
(Pounds 1.27m) and before making any allowance for the possible earn-out
from the disposal of Alpine Soft Drinks (UK).
The deficiency of shareholders' funds of Pounds 187,000 on February 28 was
corrected with an injection of Pounds 300,000 cash from convertible
redeemable preference shares.
Losses per share came out at 2.8p (16.1p).

The timing of asset sales contributed to a fall in pre-tax profits at Green
Property from IPounds 1.01m to IPounds 860,000 (Pounds 805,000) for the six
months to June 30.
However, net assets per share advanced from 181p to 194p over the six
months, due mainly to the appreciation of sterling.
Earnings per share were 3.77p (4.39p). The interim dividend is unchanged at
1.2p and the company expects that the full year payment will be at least
maintained at 3.8p.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
CE HEATH and CE Heath International Holdings yesterday announced the
successful completion of the placing of 32.4m HIH shares held by Risk
Management Holdings, a wholly owned subsidiary of Heath.
HIH is the Australian holding company which owns Heath's underwriting
operations in Australasia and the Pacific Basin and was, until its flotation
on the Australian stock exchange in June 1992, a subsidiary of Heath.
Following its listing Heath's interest was reduced to below 50 per cent.
Yesterday's placing left the insurance broking group with just 25 per cent
of the company.
The shares have been placed by MacQuarie Equities with a number of
institutional investors worldwide at ADollars 1.40 apiece, against their
last traded price of ADollars 1.42.
The placing will raise some Pounds 21m before tax, against a book value at
March 31 of about Pounds 14.3m. Of the net proceeds, Pounds 11m will be used
to reduce bank borrowings. The balance will be used to fund expansion.

FT  04 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Allied-Lyons confirms Pounds 40m buy from
Bass
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALLIED-LYONS, the drinks, food, and retailing group, yesterday strengthened
its position in the UK's growing take-home drinks market with the
acquisition of the Augustus Barnett chain of off-licences from Bass for
Pounds 40m cash.
The deal will add about 550 outlets to Allied's Victoria Wine business,
creating a nationwide estate of 1,510 shops with an 8.6 per cent share of
the Pounds 6bn market.
Whitbread's Thresher chain is the present market leader with a 10 per cent
share, closely followed by J Sainsbury and Tesco, each with more than 9 per
cent.
Mr Tony Trigg, chief executive of Allied-Lyons Retailing, said yesterday
that the location of the Augustus Barnett shops complemented those of
Victoria Wine. 'Our initial impression is that there will be very few, if
any, shop closures. Indeed, we will continue to grow the estate.'
Bass will supply a range of its beer brands to the combined operation, which
will be particularly strong in London and south-east England, the
north-west, and Scotland.
Mr Ian Prosser, Bass's chairman, said the sale reflected the group's
strategy of focusing on its main business areas of brewing, international
hotels and pub retailing.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Queens Moat Houses, the hotel group which is in talks with its banks about
refinancing its Pounds 1bn of debt, said yesterday it would hold its annual
meeting on August 26.
However, because it would be unable to prepare accounts by that date, the
meeting would be adjourned after 'having considered such business as it is
able to' and reconvened when the accounts were available.
The group said recent valuation work showed 'a significant diminution' in
its assets since December 31 which could result in a breach of its borrowing
powers.
A resolution to amend the borrowing powers would be put to the annual
meeting.

FT  04 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Advance for two building societies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO MEDIUM-sized building societies yesterday reported improvements in their
profits for the first six months of the 1993 year.
An rise in margins helped the Skipton increase its interim profits from
Pounds 645,000 to Pounds 4.17m pre-tax. Net interest receivable rose from
Pounds 21.7m to Pounds 24.1m, thanks to a reduction in the society's
wholesale funding.
Operating profits rose by 14.3 per cent, from Pounds 18.6m to Pounds 21.2m.
The society said that the number of mortgages in arrears, including
repossessions, fell by 15 per cent from the end of 1992. However, the
society's bad debt provision fell only slightly from Pounds 17.9m to Pounds
17.1m.
Mr Ron McCormick, finance director, said that was because of an increase in
provisions against commercial loans.
Assets fell slightly from the year end level of Pounds 3.01bn to Pounds
2.93bn.
Mr John Goodfellow, chief executive, said: 'Our objectives remain to improve
asset quality, retain our cost-effectiveness and maximise non-interest
income. The outlook for the housing market remains cautious, but the society
is now well positioned for a period of steady growth in performance.'
Meanwhile, the Coventry Building Society announced a 10.2 per cent increase
in interim pre-tax profits to Pounds 13.1m.
The society said that its Pounds 4.2m provision for mortgage losses, while
higher than the Pounds 3.6m recorded in the first half of 1992, was much
lower than the second half's Pounds 10.1m provision.
The results also included an exceptional debit of Pounds 841,000 reflecting
the costs involved in a restructuring of the company's management.
Net interest receivable was Pounds 25.6m (Pounds 23.6m) and operating
profits rose by 17.1 per cent to Pounds 18.1m. The society's total assets
were Pounds 2.82bn, compared with Pounds 2.7bn at the end of 1992.
Mr Martin Ritchley, Coventry's chief executive, said: 'It is envisaged that
as the long awaited upturn in the housing market takes effect, the society's
lending activity will continue to expand.'

FT  04 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Yorkshire Chemicals shares dip - Indication
of sizeable profits rise issued to dampen speculation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
YORKSHIRE Chemicals yesterday indicated that it was expecting a profits
increase of at least 20 per cent this year, in an effort to dampen
speculation over European trading which had sliced 5 per cent off its share
price by mid-morning.
Mr Phillip Lowe, chairman, said the fall in the share price - which finally
closed 16p lower at 339p - following his comments over the severity of the
European downturn had been unjustified upon close examination of the interim
results published yesterday.
'The statement, read in totality, should not be regarded as pessimistic . .
. realistic, yes, but not pessimistic,' Mr Lowe said.
He said the UK group, which derives more than 90 per cent of its sales from
abroad, had come through the worst of the European recession: 'We think we
are through the bottom.'
As a result, he said, 'I would be disappointed if we didn't advance pre-tax
profit by 20 per cent for the year as a whole'.
The group announced a 17 per cent improvement in interim pre-tax profits to
Pounds 6m, largely due to the effects of a weaker pound. Sales for the six
months to June 30 were ahead 15 per cent at Pounds 55.6m. Stripping out
exchange rate movements, pre-tax profits were marginally ahead at Pounds
5.4m on sales down Pounds 400,000 at Pounds 50.5m.
Mr Lowe said the group had suffered a particularly difficult first quarter,
when price cutting of up to 26 per cent had seriously depressed margins in
the textile dyes business. However, prices had stabilised by the second
quarter, and the trend was expected to continue in the second half.
Yorkshire had achieved 'prodigious growth' in both Australia and the US, Mr
Lowe said, while sales in the UK increased as the group penetrated new
markets.
The group expected further growth in 1994, as the five-year Pounds 42m
capital expenditure programme launched in 1991 begins to feed through. So
far this year Yorkshire had spent Pounds 5.8m on increasing capacity, 15
more cent more than last year.
Earnings per share, restated to reflect the Pounds 24m rights issue in
March, rose by 8 per cent to 9.8p.
The interim dividend is increased to 2.6p (2.5p).
COMMENT
The lemming-like race away from Yorkshire which pushed the share price over
the edge may have been slightly exaggerated. Few can find fault with the
management or the investment programme, which promises to increase capacity
significantly by 1994. The real problem appears to lie both in the
short-term and in the sector as a whole, which shows no sign of recovery in
the latter half of the year. Yorkshire's warning merely reinforced comments
made by its colleagues earlier this year. Forecasts are for a near-30 per
cent rise in profits this year to Pounds 13m, albeit on the back of currency
gains. The rather demanding prospective p/e of 18 falls to a slightly more
reasonable multiple of 15 next year on profits of Pounds 14.5m.

FT  04 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Warning from Sherwood Computer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES IN Sherwood Computer Services lost almost a third of their value
yesterday after the group warned that its first-half profits would be
'substantially below' those for the same period last year.
The shares, which reached a five year-high of 350p at the end of February
but have since dropped sharply, fell by a further 63p yesterday after the
profits warning to close at 145p.
The group, which has developed specialist software for the insurance and
housing finance markets, blamed the expected profits downturn on 'the well
publicised difficulties in the Lloyd's market and uncertainties surrounding
local government financing.'
Last year, the group reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.75m for the six
months to June 30, bolstered by lower interest costs and a Pounds 522,000
exceptional credit which offset a Pounds 200,000 charge related to earlier
difficulties in the Lloyd's insurance market.
The 1993 interim results have been brought forward and are now expected to
be announced later this month.
Mr Richard Guy, chairman, said the shortfall was largely attributable to the
problems in the Lloyd's market which have resulted in reorganisations and
contractions of agencies and the closure of syndicates. In particular,
Sherwood has been badly affected by the reorganisation at Sturge, the
largest Lloyd's managing agency.
Mr Guy said this, together with the general uncertainty in the market, had
resulted in a 'drastic reduction' in software licence revenues at a time
when Sherwood was customising its Sceptre software to meet the requirements
of Sturge.
Similarly, he said uncertainties in local government financing caused by the
replacement of the community charge with council tax had created a difficult
environment for sales of Threshold, Sherwood's public sector housing
software product.
Despite the setback, directors said they remained positive about the group's
prospects for the remainder of the year.
'Substantial new contracts have been won which will have a positive effect
in the second half and the company's finances remain sound,' they said.

FT  04 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Hughes Aircraft sues GEC for Dollars 185m
over radar system award
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
HUGHES Aircraft of the US is suing GEC for Dollars 185m (Pounds 124m) over
the hotly-contested award of the radar system for the European Fighter
Aircraft in 1990. Hughes claims that GEC misappropriated information and
breached obligations to Hughes.
The case centres on GEC's Pounds 310m purchase of the radar division of
Ferranti in January 1990. At the time, GEC was part of a consortium bidding
for the EFA radar contract, using a Hughes radar system, the MSD 2000. The
rival bidder was a consortium using a Ferranti system, the ECR 90.
At the start of January 1990, press reports suggested that the Ferranti
consortium was ahead in the race, but that the European governments awarding
the contract were nervous of Ferranti's financial condition after the
massive fraud it had suffered through acquiring International Signal and
Control of the US. GEC's purchase of the Ferranti business later that month
had the effect of guaranteeing its financial standing. The contract was
awarded to GEC/Ferranti in May of that year.
The Hughes suit, disclosed in GEC's latest report and accounts, also seeks a
royalty on sales of radars designed by GEC subsidiaries from the alleged
misappropriation of information. The case is contested by GEC, which is
counter-claiming for over Dollars 5m.

FT  04 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Starmin restates loss and rescinds dividend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STARMIN Group, the quarry products company chaired by Lord Parkinson, the
former cabinet minister, yesterday said its previously reported full year
losses had been understated by millions of pounds.
Instead of pre-tax losses of Pounds 8.06m, the company said losses totalled
Pounds 11.9m in 1992. The proposed final dividend of 0.2p will not now be
paid.
The change followed a review of the company's accounting policies, announced
in July when the two Abdullah brothers resigned as executives. They had run
Starmin since 1989.
The review, carried out by Ernst &amp; Young at the new board's instigation,
found that turnover should have been reported as Pounds 18.7m rather than
Pounds 20.1m and losses per share 3.6p instead of 2.5p.
The board does not believe it needs to amend the company's 1991 accounts,
which were also scrutinised. In a statement the company said it was
'conscious' of the need to 'to establish a longer-term strategy for
enhancing shareholder value'. The company is understood to be trading at
break-even now, but is making losses after interest payments.
The discrepancies hinge on profits having been booked on disposals which
have now been reversed.
First, the company recorded a Pounds 1.4m profit following the sale of some
assets and landfill facilities to Chepstow Environmental Services in
December 1991. However, that deal fell through.
After CES pulled out, Jeniva Landfill, a private company, bought the assets,
plus an additional quarry with a Pounds 100,000 net book value, and a Pounds
160,000 cash injection from Starmin. It paid for them in its own shares,
representing 35.5 per cent of its total equity. Starmin booked an extra
profit of Pounds 250,000 on the sale of the additional quarry.
Starmin said a balance of Pounds 1.26m which had been recorded as 'owing'
from CES was now being written off, while the Pounds 750,000 investment in
Jeniva had been written down to cost of Pounds 438,000.
Second, Starmin bought Tamar and St Mary's, two plant hire companies, in
March 1993, paying Pounds 300,000 in cash and Pounds 2.06m in the form of
assets and land. It took a Pounds 1m profit on the 'disposal'.
The statement said: 'Because of the inherent uncertainties in the valuations
of the assets concerned it would be inappropriate to recognise any effects
of this transaction.'
The board also made an exceptional provision of Pounds 1.03m relating to
non-core activities.

<TEXT>
SELECTV, the independent production company famous for comedy hits such as
Birds of a Feather and popular dramas such as Love Hurts, has decided to
move into business television.
The USM-quoted company has bought a 50 per cent stake in Tribeca Television,
a tiny independent production company run by Mr Jeffrey Ferry, a financial
journalist.
The company produced Saving the American Dream which was shown on Channel 4
last December and has a series in development looking at those who created
inter-national brands such as Swatch watches and IKEA furniture.
Mr Michael Pilsworth, managing director of SelecTV, said it was also
interested in joining any consortium considering running a business channel
on UK cable television.
'We want to apply the humour of Birds of a Feather to corporate videos in
the way John Cleese has.'
The deal involves a maximum payment of about Pounds 91,000.

FT  04 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Muscle power of a NatWest arm
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Pounds 253m interim profit made by National Westminster Bank's
securities and corporate lending arm, NatWest Markets, made it the bank's
most profitable operating sector.
The obvious question was voiced by Mr Martin Owen, its chief executive: 'Has
it all been done by mirrors', he asked.
That question translates into whether National Westminster has managed to
establish a securities business to rival that of Barclays' BZW, or whether
the figures were merely flattered by abnormal profits from foreign exchange
and capital markets trading in six months of currency volatility.
Mr Owen's answer was unsurprisingly that NatWest Markets is starting to
establish a presence a year after he was appointed chief executive. If so,
it is achieving a largely unknown feat by putting together NatWest's
corporate banking for its 1,300 largest customers with a range of securities
operations.
It was hard to tell by the figures yesterday. The bank would only break down
NatWest Markets' profits to the extent of saying that it had made strong
dealing profits of Pounds 246m from higher volumes and wider spreads, and
that its equities and venture capital operations had also done well.
Furthermore, its lending contributed to a squeeze on the international net
interest margin because it took on low margin assets in treasury operations.
Yet Mr Owen insisted that there had been 'a step jump' in the business as it
started to gain the benefits of integrated operation.
This is a significant change for NatWest, which two years ago was uncertain
of whether it would retain NatWest Securities, its broking business. It had
suffered from publicity over County NatWest's involvement with Blue Arrow,
and two Department of Trade and Industry inquiries.
Mr Derek Wanless, NatWest's chief executive, said yesterday that NatWest
Markets was 'more than exceeding the required return' from NatWest which is
now to make a 17.5 per cent post-tax return. Even discounting the
exceptional trading profits, he expects it to be above the barrier. In fact,
staff were told yesterday that treasury profits were marginally higher than
the last half of 1992, while capital markets had gained much more strongly.
Equities moved back into profit after a second half loss, while profits in
corporate finance fell from the same period.
The crucial problem in investment banking that Mr Owen has been trying to
address is that much of large corporate lending has been at too fine margins
to be profitable. Banks have to persuade corporate customers to give them
other business such as debt and equity raising, or treasury, to make money.
Mr Owen said that NatWest Markets now has systems in place that allow it to
calculate the overall value of customer relationships. 'Of course, it is
impossible to get down to the last penny in things like foreign exchange
trading, but we broadly know that we are in the right ball park,' he said.
In practice, this review has produced some shocks. Mr Owen estimates that
only 800 of 1,300 large corporates are clearly producing healthy profits. He
is working on the other 500 to raise earnings. He talks of 'appalling' one
large customer by showing quite how unprofitable the business was.
NatWest Markets has a stiff task in producing the required capital returns
because 31.5 per cent of the bank's Pounds 106.5bn risk-weighted assets are
attached to the business. This means that it will have to continue to
produce high non-interest income to make sure that lending is worthwhile.
However, Mr Owen believes that NatWest Markets' capacity for distribution of
loan and equity capital through its large securities operation will beat
smaller competitors.
The bank's size may require large returns, but it can also be used to throw
some weight around in an overcrowded market.

FT  04 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Ratner cousins share in Pounds 1m pay-off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR GERALD Ratner, the man who built Ratners into the world's largest
jewellery group, and his cousin Victor shared pay-offs for loss of office of
more than Pounds 1m last year, according to the company's annual report.
For Mr Gerald Ratner, who sowed the seeds of his own downfall by describing
one of the company's products in a speech as 'crap', the compensation was in
addition to the Pounds 456,000 pay he received for his final 10 months as
chief executive - making a total last year of more than Pounds 900,000.
He was fined Pounds 160 for a driving offence in January after magistrates
at Thame, Oxfordshire, ruled he had a disposable income of only Pounds 20 a
week.
He stepped down as chairman in January 1992, but remained as chief executive
until November when he resigned after pressure from bankers and
shareholders.
His cousin Victor resigned as deputy managing director after a management
reorganisation in February 1992 instigated by Mr James McAdam, the
newly-appointed chairman.
Ratners said yesterday that the cousins shared pay-offs totalling Pounds
1.01m, with Gerald receiving 'just under Pounds 500,000'.
That was made up of one year's basic salary of Pounds 375,000, as quoted at
the time of his resignation, plus pension, car and other benefit payments.
Victor, who was on a longer, five-year contract, received slightly more than
Pounds 500,000.
Mr McAdam was paid a slightly more modest Pounds 288,000 for the year to
January 30, including a Pounds 35,000 pension contribution.
Mr Gerald Ratner is returning to retailing as an adviser to developers
trying to convert Tobacco Dock, the failed shopping centre in London's
Wapping, into a factory outlet centre where manufacturers sell surplus stock
directly to the public at large dis-counts.
His cousin has opened a jewellery shop in Kingston-upon-Thames, and plans
more.

FT  04 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Illingworth Morris and Woolcombers push
ahead
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ILLINGWORTH Morris and Woolcombers Group, both part of a textiles empire
controlled by Mr Alan Lewis, yesterday reported gains in pre-tax profits and
turnover for the year to March 1993.
Turnover at Woolcombers, where a planned flotation was abandoned a year ago,
rose from Pounds 24.8m to Pounds 27.3m. Pre-tax profits were up from Pounds
2.95m to Pounds 3.05m.
At Illingworth Morris, Woolcombers' parent, consolidated pre-tax profits
rose from Pounds 1.39m to Pounds 1.9m on increased turnover of Pounds 57.7m,
against Pounds 48.3m in the previous year.
An extraordinary item of Pounds 541,000 (Pounds 123,000) represented costs
relating to the postponed flotation of Woolcombers.
Exceptional items of Pounds 112,000 (Pounds 190,000) partly reflected
redundancy and reorganisation costs less profits on disposal of surplus
properties.
'Cost reduction measures were implemented during the year and a major amount
of reorganisation was undertaken so as to place the group in a stronger
position,' said Mr Lewis.
Illingworth Morris was taken private by Mr Lewis in 1989, five years after
he won control from the widow of actor James Mason after a long series of
court battles.

FT  04 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Trinity back on takeover trail with
Woodhead deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRINITY International, publisher of the Liverpool Daily Post and Echo, has
returned to the takeover trail with a Pounds 12.6m recommended cash offer
for Joseph Woodhead of Huddersfield.
The independent private company publishes and prints the Huddersfield Daily
Examiner, a daily with a circulation of some 40,000.
It also owns a number of local weekly and monthly titles and a small retail
and commercial stationery business in Huddersfield.
The acquisition comes less than a month after Chester-based Trinity agreed
to buy 26 local newspapers of the Argus Press group in a deal worth Pounds
23m.
The Argus deal, which will be examined by the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission, takes Trinity into the south of England newspaper market for the
first time.
Trinity, which has been intent on expanding its regional newspaper
interests, will fund the Huddersfield acquisition from existing resources.
The company owns local and regional newspapers in north-west England, North
Wales, Canada and the US. Last year it bought Scottish and Universal
Newspapers from Lonrho for Pounds 45m.

FT  04 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Standard Life sells stake in lossmaking
Excalibur
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
STANDARD Life Assurance has sold its 4.99 per cent holding in Excalibur
Group, the precision engineering and jewellery company which last week
announced annual pre-tax losses of Pounds 6.2m.
The disposal was made on the day Excalibur announced the losses and
appointed Mr Arthur Church as chief executive. Standard is likely to have
suffered a significant loss on the disposal of the 3m shares.
Although the shares closed 1 1/2 p up on the day at 13p, Standard has held a
substantial stake since 1991 when they traded at about 45p.
Mr Richard Griffiths, the chairman's brother who has relinquished the
managing director's role in favour of a non-executive board position,
announced that he had purchased 200,000 shares at 15 1/2 p on Monday,
bringing his total holding to 0.33 per cent. The shares last night closed 2
3/4 p higher at 18p.

FT  04 AUG 93 / Parent likes the sound of the Detroit shuffle: Michael
Skapinker and Ronald van de Krol explain the warm reception for PolyGram's
purchase of the US record label
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER and RONALD VAN DE KROL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
To anyone over 30, PolyGram's artists roster contains some strange and
bewildering talents, including Chaka Demus and Pliers, the Gin Blossoms, Boy
Krazy and Positive K.
The Dollars 301m purchase of Motown, the label which nurtured such names as
Stevie Wonder, Diana Ross and the Jackson Five, therefore comes as something
of a relief.
The markets thought so too. Following yesterday's announcement of the
purchase, PolyGram's shares rose 6.4 per cent on the Amsterdam stock
exchange to close at Fl 59.50. Philips, the Dutch electronics group which
owns nearly 80 per cent of PolyGram, gained 4.8 per cent to Fl 32.60.
PolyGram's 19 per cent rise in first-half net profits to Fl 204m (Pounds
71m) was also welcomed. Mr Hendrik Hijink, an analyst at Kempen &amp; Co in
Amsterdam, said: 'A profit rise of nearly 20 per cent, particularly in
difficult economic times, is fantastic.'
The Motown acquisition is to be funded by the issue of 10m new PolyGram
shares. The cash-strapped Philips will not take up any, reducing its stake
to 75 per cent.
The Motown purchase is part of a pattern of consolidation in the music
industry, which has seen the disappearance of almost all the best-known
independent labels into the industry's multinationals. PolyGram bought
Island Records in 1989 and A&amp;M Records in 1990. Geffen, a US label, was
acquired by MCA in 1990. Thorn EMI, the UK-based group, bought Mr Richard
Branson's Virgin Music last year.
PolyGram has expanded furiously through acquisition over the past few years
but Mr Alain Levy, chief executive, does not think there are any substantial
music industry purchases still available. Apart from the Island and A&amp;M
purchases, the group bought a 30 per cent stake in Mr Andrew Lloyd Webber's
Really Useful Holdings in 1991.
PolyGram has also made film industry acquisitions, including Propaganda
Films, makers of In Bed with Madonna, and Working Title, which made My
Beautiful Laundrette. Mr Levy sees no immediate prospect of other film
purchases.
Most of the independent record labels accept that the large groups, with
worldwide distribution networks, can give their artists better exposure. Mr
Berry Gordy, who founded Motown in Detroit in 1959, said yesterday: 'The
recorded music and entertainment industries - and the world for that matter
 -are changing rapidly. Motown is ideally positioned to lead the
multicultural, multimedia revolution that is under way.'
Hopes for a multimedia revolution, in which consumers enjoy their music
through a mixture of sound, pictures and screen-based text, still lie in the
distant future as there are few signs so far that consumers will be prepared
to invest in the necessary gadgetry. A more immediate prospect is that
PolyGram will exploit Motown's extensive back catalogue and license its name
to merchandise manufacturers.
Mr Levy says the share issue necessary to fund the deal, will, by reducing
Philips' stake, give PolyGram's shares greater liquidity and widen its
shareholder base. These perceived advantages could also be seen as arguments
for reducing Philips' stake still further, but Mr Levy said yesterday this
would not happen for at least a year.
Philips was also quick to dismiss speculation that it might sell a larger
stake in PolyGram, which it brought to the Amsterdam and New York stock
exchanges in 1989. Mr Jan Timmer, Philips' chairman, has pointed out that
PolyGram is one of its most successful businesses, generating a stream of
profits and dividends, and that he has no desire to forgo future profits.
Philips said yesterday a slight dilution of its stake was acceptable because
it enabled PolyGram to seize a rare opportunity to buy one of the world's
best-known labels. 'We very much welcome this deal.'
Divestments by Philips over the past three years of its minicomputer,
defence electronics and telecommunications cables businesses have involved
the sale of loss-making or barely profitable operations. Mr Hijink said:
'There is clearly synergy between Philips and PolyGram, unlike the other
businesses Philips has sold.'
Analysts believe Philips will remain keen to hold on to a large majority
stake in PolyGram. Contributing to Philips' consumer products division,
PolyGram represents the more lucrative 'software' side of the consumer
electronics industry - compensating for losses in 'hardware' products such
as compact disc players, televisions and video cassette recorders.
PolyGram is also helping to promote the digital compact cassette (DCC),
which Philips invented to replace conventional music tapes and to compete
with the rival Mini Disc system produced by Sony of Japan.

FT  04 AUG 93 / NatWest gains on relief of bad debt in south
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NATIONAL Westminster Bank yesterday disclosed a sharp fall in provisions
against bad and doubtful debts in the first half of the year as the recovery
in the economy started to relieve bad debt in the south of England.
NatWest's bad debt provisions of Pounds 641m were 23 per cent down on the
Pounds 828m charged in the same period last year, and 36 per cent down on
the Pounds 995m provision in the second half. New provisions fell by the
largest percentage in the south.
The bank's pre-tax profits rose to Pounds 421m, against Pounds 211m, despite
making an exceptional Pounds 159m provision against its decision to pull out
of retail banking in France and Australia. It expects to recover little of a
Pounds 135m investment in France.
The most profitable sector was NatWest's corporate banking and securities
arm, NatWest Markets. It made pre-tax profits of Pounds 253m, up from Pounds
141m, helped by dealing profits of Pounds 246m. These were boosted by
currency trading in volatile conditions.
The UK retail branch business returned to a profit of Pounds 69m, compared
with a Pounds 74m loss, as provisions fell from Pounds 609m to Pounds 442m.
But branch banking profit before provisions slipped to Pounds 511m, against
Pounds 535m, because of what the bank described as weak demand for loans due
to lack of confidence.
Lord Alexander, chairman, said the recession had dominated results for three
years, but the economic background was now 'improving, albeit modestly and
patchily'. The provisions fall was welcome, but bad debts remained
unacceptably high.
The bank raised its interim dividend by 4.5 per cent to 6.4p after earnings
per share went up from 8p to 12p. Lord Alexander said it was strongly
capitalised and had 'no current plans' for a rights issue.
Mr Derek Wanless, chief executive, said there had been a lack of demand for
all forms of lending except mortgages. Lending in the branch network fell by
Pounds 2.1bn, although UK mortgages rose by Pounds 1.2bn to Pounds 10.2bn.
Mr Wanless said the bank would be 'disappointed' if provisions did not fall
further by the end of the year, but it could not be confident about the size
of the fall. The bank believed that the recovery was established but it
remained fragile.
The bank's net interest margin on loans fell from 3.2 to 2.8 per cent
because it took on lower margin assets in treasury operations. The fall in
base rates narrowed the gap between variable rate lending and retail
savings.
Non-interest income rose by 14 per cent to Pounds 1.6bn, taking it to 46 per
cent of total operating income of Pounds 3.45bn, against Pounds 3.17bn.
However, costs including exchange rate movements rose by 4 per cent to
Pounds 2.23bn.
The bank's new life insurance subsidiary, NatWest Life, contributed Pounds
21m to profits, while the mortgage operation, National Westminster Home
Loans, increased pre-tax profits from Pounds 20m to Pounds 59m helped by
asset growth and wider margins.
The bank's ratio of core tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets stayed at
5.5 per cent, although it rose from 5.2 per cent at the end of 1992, helped
by a Dollars 250m preference share issue and a Pounds 1.4bn fall in
risk-weighted assets.
The shares gained 13p to 510p.

FT  04 AUG 93 / PolyGram to buy Motown
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
POLYGRAM, the Dutch-controlled music group, is to pay Dollars 301m (Pounds
202m) for Motown, the US record label which gave the world Diana Ross,
Lionel Richie, the Four Tops, Smokey Robinson and a host of other black
stars.
The acquisition gives PolyGram, based in London, copyright more than 30,000
Motown albums, which include such hits as Marvin Gaye's 'I heard it through
the grapevine', the Temptations' 'Papa was a rollin' stone' and the
Supremes' 'Stop] In the Name of Love'.
Polygram is financing the deal through the issue of 10m new shares - worth
Fl 595m (Pounds 207m) at yesterday's closing price. Philips, the Dutch
electronics group which controls PolyGram, will not take up any shares. Its
stake in PolyGram will fall from 79.4 per cent to 75 per cent.
Mr Alain Levy, PolyGram's chief executive, said he hoped to exploit the
Motown name through merchandise sales. Other possibilities included
restaurants and theme parks carrying the Motown name.
Mr Levy said these attractions would be run by licensees. 'We don't intend
to become Disney.' Following financial difficulties experienced by Euro
Disney, near Paris, Mr Levy said he thought any Motown theme park would be
based in the US.
Mr Berry Gordy, who founded Motown in Detroit in 1959, will become chairman
emeritus of the label. Mr Jheryl Busby will remain Motown's chief executive.
Mr Levy said he had no intention of moving Motown from its Los Angeles
headquarters. It would retain its creative independence: 'I will leave it to
be American.'
Motown's artists roster still includes Diana Ross and Stevie Wonder, along
with new acts such as Johnny Gill, Another Bad Creation and Boyz II Men,
whose album Cooleyhighharmony has sold over 6m copies.
The label has been owned for the past five years by Boston Ventures, a
private investment group which specialises in media companies.
Motown appointed PolyGram its exclusive US distributor in 1991 and its
licensee for the rest of the world in January 1992. Mr Levy said both
agreements were due to end in about a year. 'After that the company would
have been available to everyone and I thought it better to make a
pre-emptive offer.'

FT  04 AUG 93 / National Power in Pounds 250m bond offer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NATIONAL Power, the UK's largest electricity generator, yesterday made its
first foray into the sterling convertible bond market with a Pounds 250m
offering.
The deal is only the company's second offering in the international capital
markets since its privatisation in 1991. The launch takes advantage of
strong demand for sterling paper from continental European investors,
fuelled by positive sentiment on sterling and by expectations that interest
rates are set to fall.
Lead manager Credit Suisse First Boston estimated that 40 per cent of the
paper was placed in the UK and 60 per cent in continental Europe.
Two recent convertible offerings by Coats Viyella and Warburg are now
trading at a premium to their issue price of 3 1/2 and 6 1/2 points
respectively.
National Power has embarked on a programme of international expansion as its
domination of the UK market dwindles. Last month it bought Dallas-based
Transco Energy Ventures, its biggest overseas deal to date.
Mr Brian Birkenhead, group finance director, said the company planned to
spend 'about Pounds 1bn on equity stakes in overseas power projects this
decade'.
The company also hopes to have an opportunity to buy back some of the Pounds
350m of its debt still held by the government. Last year, the government
sold Pounds 1.3bn of privatised company debt at auction, and there has been
speculation that another such auction is being considered. National Power is
paying interest of 12 per cent on the debt, which matures in 1998.
If the government decides to sell off its remaining 40 per cent stake in the
company, National Power hopes to list some shares on the New York Stock
Exchange, which would give the company access to dollar funding in future
and provide a hedge for US operations.
Mr Birkenhead said the funding would also smooth cashflow, which 'has become
much more seasonal'.
The 15-year bonds carry a coupon of 6 1/4 per cent and can be converted into
ordinary shares at Pounds 4.33, a premium of 19 per cent to the market level
of Pounds 3.64 at the time of pricing yesterday. The shares closed at Pounds
3.60, down 11p.
The bonds were quoted at 100 1/2, a 1/2 point premium to their par issue
price.

Telecom's sale of STC Submarine Systems to Alcatel, the French
telecommunications equipment supplier.
BT believes the sale of STC Submarine Systems will reduce competition in the
undersea cable market.
BT is also concerned that the disposal could make it unduly reliant on AT&amp;T,
the largest North American operator and equipment supplier.
As an international operator, AT&amp;T is in increasingly fierce competition
with BT. AT&amp;T's manufacturing arm is one of only four leading suppliers of
long-distance undersea cables: if the sale goes ahead, it will be one of
only three.
As yet, the UK's Department of Trade and Industry has only consulted BT
informally. It is awaiting a decision from the European Commission's
competition directorate on whether the Pounds 600m sale falls within EC or
UK merger rules.
Either way, BT will oppose the deal on competition grounds. Mr Brian Rigby,
BT's procurement director, said: 'Because of the developmental work
necessary, buying cables means revealing more about forward intentions than
we would like to give competitors.'
STC estimates that it secured 23 per cent of the Dollars 10.2bn (Pounds
6.8bn) long-distance undersea cable market between 1985 and the end of last
year. With an estimated 37 per cent, AT&amp;T was the market leader. Alcatel is
believed to have taken 19 per cent, and NEC and Fujitsu of Japan 18 per cent
between them.
BT is concerned about the impact on prices if AT&amp;T and Alcatel dominate the
market. The company always seeks competitive bids for undersea cable
contracts, and faces growing price competition for its international
traffic.

FT  04 AUG 93 / Serb and Croat leaders called to Bosnia talks
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INTERNATIONAL mediators yesterday summoned Mr Slobodan Milosevic, Serbia's
president, and Mr Franjo Tudjman, his Croat counterpart, back to Geneva in
an effort to salvage the Bosnian peace talks.
Last night's move appeared aimed at exerting pressure on Bosnia's president,
Mr Alija Izetbegovic, to return to the talks, which will decide the
republic's ethnic partition.
For the second day Mr Izetbegovic refused to attend talks until Bosnian Serb
forces withdrew from Mount Bjelasnica, a strategic peak southwest of
Sarajevo.
He also appeared to be waiting to see if Nato would launch air strikes on
Bosnian Serb artillery laying siege to Sarajevo. A Nato council meeting in
Brussels yesterday morning approved a US plan to use air strikes to break
the siege.
Mr Izetbegovic yesterday wrote to the United Nations and European Community
appealing for urgent military help.
Mr Reginald Bartholomew, US president Bill Clinton's peace envoy, returning
from the Nato meeting, held talks with Bosnia's Moslem president in a bid to
dissuade him from derailing the peace talks by holding out for western
military intervention
In London, Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, warned that although Britain
was prepared for military action, the Moslems should not stall the peace
process by hoping for military aid.
Bosnian Serb officials warned privately that if the Moslems boycotted the
talks, Serbian and Croatian leaders would continue negotiations and exclude
the Moslems from an agreement.
The Moslem-led Bosnian delegation was plunged into deeper disarray when the
three Croat members of Bosnia's collective leadership staged a walk-out in
protest against a Moslem advance and attacks on Croat troops in central
Bosnia.
Mr Tudjman welcomed the Croatian protest. 'I think it will introduce more
seriousness to the negotiations and lead Izetbegovic to stop offensive
operations and ethnic cleansing against Croats,' he said.
The White House welcomed the Nato agreement and stressed that the threat of
force was real. But as a sign of the diplomatic disagreements still dogging
the allied plans, Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary-general, again
emphasised that only he could give the go-ahead for the air strikes.

FT  04 AUG 93 / The Lex Column: British Coal
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The government's haste to unload British Coal is perhaps understandable, as
the clock is already ticking on the corporation's cosy five-year contracts
with the electricity generators. If private mine operators are to stand any
chance of making money, they will need more than the fag end of the current
contract followed by an uncertain market after 1998. Trade buyers will only
be interested in packages of pits which will repay their equity investment
before the contract expires.
Whether the government can deliver in short order is, however, another
question. Knotty issues such as the separation of environmental liabilities,
responsibility for employees and changes to safety regulations still need a
great deal of work. Whatever the progress of the legislation, it may not be
possible to resolve all of these technical issues before the end of 1994.
The underlying market for coal is also deteriorating, with the prospects for
production after 1998 dim. Abolition of the franchise market in electricity
will increase uncertainty and push the generators towards short-term coal
purchases. Gas and nuclear output will also squeeze coal's share of the base
load market, while environmental legislation may make ageing coal stations
uneconomic. Against this, it may be very difficult to sweeten British Coal
sufficiently to attract outright buyers. Leasing pits to operators might
prove simpler, even if it does not finally rid the government of the shadow
of Old King Coal.

FT  04 AUG 93 / The Lex Column: PolyGram
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
PolyGram is hardly buying Motown for a song. Even by the industry's funky
standards, PolyGram is paying a lot for the black music label. The Dollars
301m consideration is almost five times the sum Motown fetched when it was
sold in 1988. After subtracting the Dollars 50m value PolyGram is ascribing
to the licensing and franchising activities, the acquisition price works out
at 1.9 times its record sales. That may be similar to the multiple Thorn EMI
paid for Virgin's music business. But then Thorn was able to make
significant savings by merging its marketing and distribution activities. No
such benefits are available to PolyGram, which was already acting as
Motown's distributor.
Still, Motown has scarcity value as about the only big independent label
left around. Its catalogue of 30,000 albums contains some compulsively
foot-stomping hits. New artists such as Boyz II Men and Another Bad Creation
suggest it also has growth potential. PolyGram's 19 per cent increase in
interim profits testifies to its skill in exploiting such raw material.
The deal again raises the vexed question of whether Philips should give its
infant prodigy greater leeway by selling off more shares. But PolyGram's
rights issue suggests it already has a fair degree of financial autonomy,
diluting Philips' holding to 75 per cent. Even though it is strapped for
cash, the Dutch giant is hardly going to be singing I Want Money when it
reports its second-quarter results on Thursday. PolyGram is likely to remain
the sunshine of its life.

FT  04 AUG 93 / The Lex Column: Capital returns
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
National Westminster has long justified its low capital ratio with the
argument that bad debt provisions would come down before loan demand began
to accelerate. So far, that gamble has paid off. Lower bad debt provisions
helped double first-half profits despite a Pounds 159m charge for shedding
retail business in France and Australia. Unlike Lloyds, NatWest has gone to
the trouble of having its first-half figures reviewed by its auditors. Under
new EC rules, that allows retained interim profit to count as tier one
capital. With some judicious balance sheet management as well, the tier one
ratio has risen to 5.5 per cent from 5.2 at the end of 1992.
In a period of weak loan demand when competitors such as Lloyds and Abbey
National have too much capital, there may be an argument for economising on
capital to boost returns. Even so, NatWest has to draw a fine line between
efficiency and safety. Its ratio would still look skimpy if loan demand did
revive. Pressure on lending margins while the economy remains weak will slow
the flow of retained profits needed to position the bank for recovery.
Indeed, its interim figures reinforce the impression that operating profits
in banking are hard to come by. At constant exchange rates, income before
provisions grew by only 5 per cent. NatWest Markets put in an outstanding
performance but its trading profits are not a guaranteed source of growth.
It is hard to escape the conclusion that large banks cannot survive just by
cutting costs and raising fees. Unfashionable though it sounds, they need
interest income too.

FT  04 AUG 93 / City argues benefits to environment of security cordon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER and JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SECURITY cordon around the financial heart of the City of London may
become permanent as a result of unforeseen environmental benefits. The
Corporation of London yesterday cited these to support its proposal that the
cordon, set up in the wake of April's IRA bombing, should stay in place
indefinitely.
'There have been some quite astonishing environmental benefits,' said Mr
Michael Cassidy, chairman of the policy and resources committee. The effects
of the cordon had been 'wholly positive', resulting in reduced pollution,
less car traffic, and greater freedom of movement for pedestrians.
The Corporation will list these benefits in making a case for closing the
roads on environmental grounds under the Road Traffic Act.
It has decided not to attempt to persuade the government to allow the
closures on security grounds, as opponents argue that there is a risk of
handing a propaganda victory to the IRA. The environmental case for closing
the roads may be disputed by surrounding boroughs, concerned that the City's
cordon will increase their traffic problems.
The proposals for a permanent security cordon were part of a Pounds 5m
package of anti-terrorist proposals, which are subject to public
consultation until August 23. Other measures include efforts to co-ordinate
companies' security systems; a pager alert system; and the removal of litter
bins. Technically advanced cameras at checkpoints will photograph drivers
entering the City, at a cost of Pounds 500,000.
The cordon, introduced on a temporary basis on July 3, involves closing 18
roads and setting up vehicle checkpoints.
If surrounding boroughs oppose the road closures, the proposal will go to a
public inquiry. The issue would be decided by Mr John MacGregor, the
transport secretary.
Tower Hamlets, one of the surrounding boroughs, is considering whether to
oppose the proposal to make the cordon permanent. It is worried that the
cordon may increase car parking by people using the Underground for the
final part of their journey.
The City police said extra police presence and extra cameras had contributed
to a fall in the crime rate by 16.4 per cent in the first six months of the
year.
Mr Colin Coxall, acting commissioner of the City police, said that, while
the system could not be totally foolproof, 'the measures make it much more
likely that another terrorist attack would be thwarted and those responsible
arrested'.

FT  04 AUG 93 / Heavy truck decision angers pressure groups and industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FREIGHT transport industry and environmentalists yesterday attacked from
separate flanks a government decision allowing the use of 44-tonne lorries
on journeys to and from UK rail freight terminals.
Regulations to be introduced in the autumn will allow the heavier lorries on
such routes, provided that they are six-axle vehicles which spread loads
evenly. The present limits are 38 tonnes for articulated lorries and 35
tonnes for lorries pulling trailers.
Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, said the heavier vehicles would be
no bigger and cause no more wear to roads than existing vehicles. He
predicted that the measure, combined with other incentives to move goods by
rail, would reverse the long-term decline in rail freight.
However, the decision was immediately attacked as a missed opportunity to
raise the weight limits for all lorries on Britain's roads. The
Confederation of British Industry said that allowing 44-tonne trucks more
generally would have enhanced the competitiveness of British business.
The Freight Transport Association said that lifting the limit for all
lorries to 44 tonnes would reduce the number of lorries on the road and save
industry Pounds 300m in transport costs.
The shipping industry complained that the restrictions would remain on
lorries using ferries. Sir Nicholas Hunt, director-general of the Chamber of
Shipping, described shipping as 'the transport mode most friendly to the
environment'.
Environmental pressure groups said the decision was unlikely to reverse the
decline of rail freight. Mr Tony Burton of the Council for the Protection of
Rural England said that, without close enforcement of the routes, it would
increase the number of lorries in villages and on country roads.
The change in rules is intended to encourage industry to send more container
freight by rail, according to Mr MacGregor. Existing lorry weight limits do
not allow containers to be loaded to their maximum capacity.
Mr Garry Turvey, director-general of the Freight Transport Association, said
that the government had chosen an option with the least benefits to
industry, the environment and the economy.

FT  04 AUG 93 / Tory MPs warn against British involvement in Bosnia air
strikes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The reaction of some Tory MPs suggested that British involvement in air
strikes would risk opening fresh divisions in the party, David Owen writes.
Mr Nicholas Budgen, MP for Wolverhampton South-West, said: 'We should
declare that there is no British national interest at stake here . . ., that
the best way we can contribute to future peace is to withdraw our forces and
emphasise to the contestants that their future lies in their own hands.'
Mr John Wilkinson, MP for Ruislip Northwood, said he was 'sceptical' about
the efficacy of air strikes. 'I think it would heighten Serb intransigence
and probably lead to retaliation against our troops.' But Mr Patrick
Cormack, MP for Staffordshire South, said: 'I believe we should have taken
firm action a long, long time ago.'

<TEXT>
On the face of it, there could hardly be a more comfortable time to be a
banking supervisor. The attempt by banks to reduce their levels of risk from
the reckless late 1980s should simplify the task of the Bank of England.
Rather than having to rein in the banks, it could theoretically enjoy a
spell of peace and quiet as they start to amass capital and spurn the poor
lending of the past, writes John Gapper.
The task under the 1987 Banking Act of Mr Brian Quinn, executive director of
banking supervision, is to protect depositors' money. He can thus afford not
to interfere, even if a bank has grown too cautious and is building up
excess capital. 'We are here to protect the depositor. If a bank chooses to
become overcapitalised then so be it. That is a commercial decision.'
Mr Quinn's job is becoming more complex, for several reasons:
Derivative products, such as interest rate swaps, may help reduce the
obvious balance sheet risks faced by banks, but they raise other, less
quantifiable risks, such as credit exposures to the other parties involved.
This means that the chance of a catastrophic loss that could affect the
financial system could be increased by the banks' efforts to avoid smaller
losses, about which the Bank is sanguine.
As banks review past risks, they could all shift capital into promising
businesses, such as private banking, at the same time. This could reduce
their profitability: margins would fall as they competed with each other.
The central bank is the only body that can see where they are all heading at
once. 'One of our strengths is that we know when everyone is coming in here
at the same time talking about the latest fad,' Mr Quinn says.
The Bank now faces demands to judge complex models of risk intended to help
allocate capital. This could mean that it would be approving an approach to
banking, rather than just checking banks' safety. However, Mr Quinn regards
the approval of models as different from deciding on loans. 'Judging models
involves assessing a methodology; judging credits involves assessing
individual transactions. The latter is the banks' job, not ours,' he says.
Capital may be taken away from types of lending that have proved riskier
than expected. This difficulty has been highlighted by the Bank's own work
on risk, following the excesses of 1980s lending. Its analysis of risk over
cycles found that some industrial sectors, such as property, not only
responded with more volatility to economic conditions, but followed the
cycles more closely.
Barclays is one bank that has said it intends to rebalance its portfolio to
reduce the exposure to property lending. Other banks could make similar
decisions that would affect credit in the economy for which the Bank has
responsibility as a monetary authority. Yet there is no logical reason for a
bank supervisor to interfere in a process that is likely to strengthen
banks.
Indeed, Mr Quinn insists that the Bank's monetary role is irrelevant. 'That
does not come into (my task). If I see from examining banks' books that
asset growth will be slower, I do not bring any pressure to bear to alter
that,' he says. He has views, however, on the inadvisability of banks
cutting off lending to particular sectors just because they have previously
priced such lending inadequately.
'The lesson is not that you should stay away from property, but that you
should analyse it, and price loans properly,' he says. Nonetheless, the
severe swings in profitability in some forms of lending do carry a higher
risk of sudden catastrophic loss, which would affect depositors. The Bank
has its own reasons to encourage banks to turn away from riskier lending
with higher cyclical losses.

FT  04 AUG 93 / Leading Article: After franc fort a franc float
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FRENCH government has reason to feel aggrieved at Europe's weekend
reversion to dirty floating exchange rates. Some combination of Belgian,
Danish, Dutch and German opposition to the temporary departure of the D-Mark
from the exchange rate mechanism, and the clearly second-best adoption of
very wide ERM bands, has forced France to sanction what appears to be an
implicit and politically embarrassing franc devaluation. But the new soft
ERM does now give the French government the freedom to deliver what its
economy desperately needs: a substantial cut in interest rates. If the
benefits of the last 10 franc fort years are not to be squandered, it should
take the opportunity.
To do so, France must first recognise that the useful life of the franc fort
policy - designed to secure low inflation by tying the currency tightly to
the D-Mark - has passed for now. This is not to suggest either that the
franc fort policy has failed or was misconceived - quite the reverse. France
currently has an inflation rate half that of Germany and, more
significantly, a marginally lower interest rate on its long-term government
bonds. France is now paying to Germany the highest compliment a tutor can
hope for: imitation which surpasses the teacher's own abilities, a fact that
may discomfort the Bundesbank president, Helmut Schlesinger.
Moreover, France has used the franc fort years to amass sizeable gains in
competitiveness. The franc has appreciated by more than 5 per cent against a
basket of European currencies since the beginning of 1987, when the last
wholesale ERM realignment occurred. But consistently low rates of wage
inflation relative to its competitors have more than offset any loss in
competitiveness from this nominal appreciation. French industry thus finds
itself, despite the appreciation of the past nine months, in a much stronger
competitive position than when the policy began.
D-Mark appreciation
But the franc fort's success, combined with the wayward behaviour of Germany
since unification, has made the policy increasingly inimical to French
interests. Germany's need to shift resources from west to east, the
government's fiscal profligacy, and the resulting shift to a current account
deficit, have required the D-Mark to appreciate and German interest rates to
rise. But the combination of the hard ERM, and France's stubborn resistance
to a D-Mark appreciation, have transmitted excessively high interest rates
and an unnecessary recession across Europe. The success of the franc fort
policy in reducing French inflation meant that short-term real interest
rates became ever more painful, and ultimately unsustainable.
Mercifully, for French companies, banks and consumers, the French government
now has the flexibility to re-orientate its distorted economic policy. The
priority for the French government must be to ensure that it can return, as
soon as possible, to economic growth with low inflation.
Cut rates
First, the government must cut short-term interest rates by at least 2
percentage points. Every domestic inflationary indicator suggests that
French monetary policy remains far too severe. Broad money growth, at 3.1
per cent over the past year, is too slow to sustain a recovery, while
three-month money market interest rates of 7 per cent mean that the yield
curve remains inverted. Consumer price inflation is less than 2 per cent a
year and wage inflation fell to an annual rate of 2.6 per cent in the second
quarter, its lowest level in more than a decade.
Second, the French government must consolidate its reputation for low
inflation. By accelerating changes at the Bank of France which can entrench
the bank's nominal independence, and explaining how domestic monetary
indicators will be monitored, it can demonstrate its commitment to keeping
inflation low.
Third, France should accept that it cannot rejoin Germany in a system of
narrow bands (even in a reformed ERM) until the latter's inflationary and
fiscal problems are under control. Rejoining before German interest rates
have fallen substantially would not be consistent with price stability in
France.
What the government must not do is attempt to keep the franc fort policy
alive by trying to shadow the D-Mark in its old ERM bands. That would mean
resisting the interest rates French industry desperately needs, and
perversely, may well increase the chances of the French franc falling much
further and make the politics of an eventual return to a hard ERM more
difficult. Economy minister Edmond Alphandery was right to say early on
Monday morning that franc stability, both domestically and on the foreign
exchanges, would be the priority for French monetary policy. Both objectives
imply that the franc fort policy should be mourned and then, for a period,
forgotten.

A sure sign that the silly season has started. Two British seaside resorts
are in a flap after discovering their money-spinning Birdman competitions
clash next Sunday.
To win, entrants must launch themselves off a ramp on the two towns'
respective piers and 'fly' under their own power across the sea. Competitors
can use wings, skateboards and mountain bikes to assist their take-off.
Bognor Regis has hosted the event for the past 21 years and was the site of
last year's record flight of 86.4 metres.
However, a predator has appeared on Bognor's horizon. Eastbourne, a bigger
rival, threatens to swoop off with many of the 160,000 visitors who attend
the high point of Bognor's tourist season. Eastbourne's excuse is that its
Birdman competition is just one of nearly 50 events taking place in a
five-day air festival.
'I think Bognor is quackers to get upset,' says Eastbourne marketing chief
Tony Clarke - which is a rather more polite version of the alleged last
remarks of King George V, the man who gave Bognor its Regis, on being told
that he would soon be well enough to visit his favourite seaside resort
again.

<TEXT>
A couple of weeks ago Observer highlighted an apparent correlation between
the financial performance of media-buyer Aegis and the type of refreshment
it serves up at its agms. The fancier the comestibles, the better the
results - and vice versa.
Now BBJ Media Services - one of Aegis's many children - has picked up the
largest media-buying account to change hands so far this year: Ranks Hovis
McDougall's annual advertising spend of Pounds 18m.
Given the brands within the RHM portfolio - Bisto gravy, Paxo stuffing, a
host of Chinese and Indian chutneys and sauces, and Mr Kipling's ready-made
cakes - Observer feels slightly queasy at the thought of what kind of fare
will be dished out at Aegis's next presentation.

Former presidential hopeful Ross Perot should stick to chat shows. If anyone
still thinks the jug-eared millionaire holds promise, they were not
listening to his grilling on last weekend's 'Meet the Press'.
Repeatedly quizzed by journalists over his plans to slash health spending,
Perot claimed he had left his 'very detailed list' at home. He would have
brought it had he been asked, he wailed, as the Wall Street Journal reminded
him this was not 'some piddling little detail', but over half of his total
proposed spending cuts.
Just stopping short of making history by becoming the first guest in 46
years to walk off the show, Perot tried to turn the tables.
'Washington doesn't keep books. It's like flying blind in a 747 down on the
deck, wide open through the mountains at night in the fog,' spluttered the
one-time master of the sound bite.
When someone politely enquired whether Perot planned to stand again in 1996,
the Texan replied that he hoped it would be unnecessary. As a Republican
candidate then? 'That would be up to them.'
All in all, as Clinton's campaign strategist James Carville remarked, Perot
would have been better off in church last Sunday.

Tory spin doctors charged with repairing the party's battered image have
another potentially explosive event to pencil into their Filofaxes.
The BBC announced yesterday that its four-part series Thatcher: The Downing
Street Years, will run in October. The date has not been fixed but it would
be a miracle if did not coincide with the Tory party conference in
Blackpool. A 'no-holds-barred' interview with the grande dame is promised,
duly offering yet another opportunity to re-open old wounds just when party
managers will be desperately trying to rally the party faithful.
Scant consolation that Hugh Scully, the executive producer, made his name as
presenter of The Antiques Roadshow.

FT  04 AUG 93 / Observer: A minor omission
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
When John Tusa, the new president of Wolfson College, Cambridge, stepped
down after six years running the BBC World Service, there was mild surprise
in some quarters that he did not get even a minor mention in the Queen's
birthday honours list.
After all he left the World Service in better shape than he inherited it.
However, this oversight is nothing compared with his latest humiliation in
the BBC annual report. Four retiring governors are thanked for their
'distinguished' service and there is a decent mention for Johnny Beerling,
the former controller of Radio One.
But Tusa, who introduced some pretty radical changes at the World Service,
is relegated to a footnote listing the outgoing members of the board of
management.
Yesterday BBC chairman Marmaduke Hussey tried to make amends. He sent his
chauffeur to deliver a note to Tusa, who had been presenting the BBC TV
lunchtime news, apologising for 'the regrettable oversight'.
Surely the 'oversight' could not have had anything to do with the fact that
Tusa had let it be known that he was never given the chance to apply for the
director general's job at the BBC? He was a firm favourite of the staff,
which possibly explains why the chairman didn't love him.

FT  04 AUG 93 / Leading Article: Asia and the global village
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ON THE streets of Kuala Lumpur, it is impossible to buy newspapers from
neighbouring Singapore. In Singapore, a self-styled hub of global
communication, there is a parallel ban on selling newspapers from Malaysia.
Both countries have shouldered their way to the front among developing
nations in terms of growth and rising income levels. But their governments -
though they are vying with each other to host regional media centres -
continue to take fright at the flow of information which, they fear, could
in some way destabilise them. They are jumping at shadows, particularly when
they rail - as Malaysia's prime minister did yesterday - against the spread
of satellite television.
Singapore's government has mostly managed to keep the lid on many kinds of
behaviour it regards as anti-social - including satellite television -
partly thanks to enviable success in delivering higher standards of living,
and partly because of its compactness. In this haven for business, the
editor of the country's own leading business newspaper has run foul of the
law for publishing a quarterly gross domestic product growth estimate before
its official release. The government's action this week to limit the
circulation of the Economist, half-owned by the Financial Times, is but the
latest in a string of actions against foreign media organisations.
Totalitarian governments
In the rest of the world, however, government attempts to control
information have long been exposed as futile. The lesson of the ex-Soviet
countries is that in the end, even totalitarian governments could not curb
the use of the samizdat fax machine and the incursions of foreign
broadcasters.
In Asia, the proliferation of satellite dishes in countries which restrict
their sale - Malaysia, Indonesia and China - underlines the growing
difficulty of controlling choice when rising living standards feed the
appetite for entertainment. Star Television, the Hong Kong broadcaster, has
developed a huge viewership among Asian audiences who welcome the variety
offered by its five channels. Dr Mahathir Mohamad, prime minister of
Malaysia, is alarmed at Mr Rupert Murdoch's purchase of a controlling stake
in Star TV. He suggested yesterday that Mr Murdoch's purpose was to 'control
the news that we are going to receive,' and launched into a familiar attack
on the western press for its portrayal of Asian countries.
Indigenous culture
Some concerns of Asian governments are understandable. They fear that
indigenous culture will be undermined by a seductive diet of MTV and soap
operas; they are right to want news that reflects their citizens'
priorities. The answer, however, does not lie in attempts at direct control,
any more than it lay in UN-sponsored attempts a decade ago to promote a 'new
information order' purged of western values.
Citizens want choice; technology ensures that they will have it. Governments
should focus upon fostering an environment in which choice can flourish.
That means restricting concentrations of ownership and nurturing the kinds
of media which they feel to be beneficial. For example, Dr Mahathir suggests
that Asian countries should start their own network. Many south-east Asian
newspapers are already very profitable and could easily invest in
development of new pan-Asian media.
The experience of Hong Kong and Thailand suggests that the economic miracle
is not threatened by press freedom.
In controlling their own press and railing at the western media, leaders of
some Asian countries betray their pre-occupation with past battles and their
failure to come to terms with their own economic success.

FT  04 AUG 93 / The very model of a modern risk: Efforts by UK banks to
ensure capital is allocated to operations with the best real returns
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At 7.30 yesterday morning, UK banks crossed a threshold. National
Westminster Bank reported the first fall for three years in its debt
provisions. The bad risks taken by the clearing banks in the late 1980s are
finally starting to recede into history. Yet banks are not just looking back
on the recent past with relief: they are also vowing never to expose
themselves to the same degree of danger again.
Risk is at the heart of banks' traditional business. They lend money at
rates of interest, taking the risk of default. But the boom of the late
1980s and subsequent recession taught them a harsh lesson: they had exposed
themselves to far bigger risks than they realised. Banks' share prices are
now trading at a 15-year high relative to other industries, partly because
investors believe their earnings will not be allowed to swing so wildly
again.
The fluctuation in earnings between the late 1980s and now led to banks'
capital being eaten away when they started sustaining losses on lending. At
the same time, lending margins were reduced by competition and large
companies borrowing money on the capital markets. Banks have concluded that
they must find ways of making money other than simply lending it, because
the old margins on lending do not cover risks adequately.
The initial response has been to diversify into operations which produce
fees and commission rather than interest. In retail banking, this means
selling life insurance and other financial products. On the corporate side,
it means capital markets and securities operations. But underlying this is a
questioning of whether banks should carry on lending money under the same
conditions as in the past.
The most extreme reaction to the emergence of unforeseen risks would be to
stop lending completely. US banks such as Bankers Trust have been cutting
down the number of loans they hold on their balance sheets, while seeking
new trading income. It would be near inconceivable for UK clearing banks,
with their huge range of retail and wholesale businesses, to stop lending.
But it is quite likely that they will increasingly avoid lending that
carries higher risk.
Bankers insist, however, that they will not retreat. 'If we were not going
to take any risk, we could just buy US treasury bills and not employ
anyone,' says Mr Richard Goeltz, National Westminster's chief financial
officer. But others admit that there is at least temporary caution. 'Banking
got a monumental shock in the 1980s, and it takes time to recover,' says Mr
John French, head of risk at HSBC Group.
Banks face a harder task than just recovering their nerve. There are several
ways in which business may be riskier than in the past. One is that lending
mistakes will not be nullified by asset price inflation: a rise in the value
of the underlying security, such as property, will not bail out debtors. A
second is that the growth in the use of derivatives - new financial
instruments - like currency swaps may increase risks such as exposure to
other traders.
More broadly, banks are increasingly operating in an open environment in
which their mistakes are exposed to both public comment and regulatory
punishment. Mr Mervyn Pedelty, head of risk management at TSB Group, says
the bank treats compliance and image as elements of risk. 'The reputation of
a business like ours is very important, because you cannot sell products to
customers if you have a poor reputation,' he says.
Faced with these challenges, banks are now trying to devise methods of
better assessing risk. They are taking a lead from Bankers Trust, which
developed measures of return on capital, weighted by risk, to choose where
it should allocate funds in trading operations. The intention of
risk-adjusted return on capital (Raroc) measures is to ensure that the bank
allocates its capital to operations with the best real returns.
NatWest has started to assess its operations against two measures of
risk-adjusted return. It has calculated returns over past business cycles to
measure both the average annual return in each operation, and the minimum
likely return in poor years. It is trying to identify not only how
profitable its operations are, but also how volatile their returns are, and
thus how exposed the bank is to cyclical swings.
Mr Goeltz says the analysis has been thought-provoking, but he is unwilling
to discuss which operations it raises doubts about. 'There are a couple of
real shocks, things that defy the conventional wisdom,' he says. He argues
that the process provides the bank with a useful discipline. 'With the
figures, you can challenge managers. You can say: 'Here is what you are
going to have to do to make a return,' ' he says.
The question is whether the model can be used to do more: can UK banks start
to allocate capital according to risk models? Most banks doubt the validity
of such a notion for two reasons: first, because they are more complex
businesses than Bankers Trust, which focuses on securities trading and
derivatives; second, branch managers may encounter difficulty applying the
results of an analysis.
The range of activities in a large British bank is such that it is extremely
hard to compare them. 'Our trading operations may have nice mathematical
tools to manage risk, but we have no means of comparing the profitability of
sterling swaps to mortgages, or US credit cards,' says Mr Goeltz of NatWest.
In addition, banks may lack sufficiently reliable data to judge the risks of
lending. Trading in securities and capital markets is rapid enough to
produce a store of data, but credit risk is governed by long-term economic
cycles. Few banks have data going back far enough. And their most recent
information has been drawn from the extreme and probably atypical economic
conditions of the late 1980s.
The second problem of introducing risk analyses is practical. Dealers may
understand the notion of trading positions based on limited allocations of
capital, but such a way of working is alien to lending managers. Mr French
says HSBC has not adopted such measures because they are unlikely to be
understood well enough to be useful. 'You can produce the most sophisticated
measures going, but if your people do not comprehend them, they are no
good,' he says.
Mr Martin Cruttenden, head of risk management at Lloyds Bank, argues that
Raroc models do not suit big retail banks. Models may lend direction, but
they are not a means of running operations. 'The only area of operations
where we feel the need for that degree of analysis is our treasury,' he
says. At the branch level, he believes there is 'no substitute for a
manager's intelligent knowledge of the customer'.
Yet whether risk models are used is not the most important question. More
vital is how banks' behaviour will be changed by their general sense of
increased risk. They have already shown signs of trying to reduce their
exposure. Banks' assets are weighted according to how risky they are thought
to be, and the ratio of risk-weighted assets to total assets has fallen from
80 per cent to 70 per cent over the past five years.
So although balance sheets have not contracted, higher-risk assets such as
commercial loans have shrunk as a proportion of the total. As banks enter a
period of limited lending growth, a continuing shift in the mix of assets
could result in real cuts in some forms of lending. The most obvious targets
would be lending to small businesses on which bad debts have been high, and
some industrial sectors such as construction.
Bankers resist such a suggestion. 'Of course our managers who have had their
fingers burnt do not forget it easily, but our job is to manage risk, not to
avoid it,' says Mr John Davies, deputy chief executive of Lloyds. Yet there
are reasons beyond the strict logic of risk management for bankers to seek
forms of lending which avoid the extremes of high profits in good times, and
heavy losses in the odd bad year.
The risk models may find nothing wrong with holding a mix of assets which
produces such high returns in most years that it offsets exceptional losses,
but neither bank investors nor executives are likely to agree. The high
share prices enjoyed by banks at the moment have emerged because fund
managers believe that banks have started to even out the old cyclical swings
in earnings that used to plague them.
Banks are therefore likely to prove cautious about simply plunging back into
high-margin and high-risk lending, such as property, that attracted them so
disastrously in the past. Avoiding such risk may please bank shareholders,
but it will have unknown effects on the financing of economic recovery.
Banks may have crossed a threshold yesterday, but the customers who come to
them for loans could come to regret the achievement.

FT  04 AUG 93 / Wrong order of priority: Last week's real disasters were not
in the money markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD MORTIMER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'The Russian Revolution? You can't stop me shrugging my shoulders. On the
scale of ideas it is, at most, a vague ministerial crisis.'
The author of those words was a surrealist poet, Louis Aragon, who later
became a leading French communist. By the same token, perhaps one day I
shall become a convinced monetarist. But, for the moment, my view of the
turmoil in the currency markets is essentially Aragon's view of Russia,
vintage 1924. 'To call it revolutionary,' he added, 'is a veritable abuse of
language.' The same could be said when words like 'disaster' are used about
the demise (or relaxation) of the European exchange rate mechanism.
I'm not sure I would go quite as far as The Independent - the admirable but
eccentric British newspaper which banished the ERM completely from its front
page on Monday morning and used the space to print the names of more than
2,000 people supporting its call for military action to save Sarajevo. But I
sympathise with its objective, which must have been to restore our sense of
proportion. The real disasters of the last week were not in the currency
markets but in Bosnia and Lebanon.
It's hard to say which was more depressing: the grim face of Mr Yitzhak
Rabin, the Israeli prime minister, who told a parliamentary committee his
offensive in Lebanon was designed (yes, designed) to create a wave of
refugees; or the beaming faces of Mr Slobodan Milosevic, the Serbian
president, and Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, when Bosnia's
president Alija Izetbegovic conceded their aim - a division of his country
along ethnic lines.
Israelis do not like being compared with the Serbs. In a letter in Monday's
FT, one explained that Bosnian Moslems have no choice but to flee, whereas
the Lebanese do have the choice. All they have to do, it seems, is 'express
their hostility to the terrorist group', Hizbollah, and 'Israel will welcome
these inhabitants back'.
Very generous, I'm sure. But one thing one can say for the Serbs is that
they are only seeking, by utterly barbarous methods, to control areas of
Bosnia and Croatia where they already live. No Israeli has ever lived in
south Lebanon. In so far as others who do live there support Hizbollah, they
do so because it is fighting Israeli occupation of the 'security zone'
inside Lebanon.
Israel rightly objects to Katyusha rockets being fired at its territory.
That has been the ostensible reason for all its military activities in
Lebanon, including the unbelievably destructive invasion of 1982. But the
problem is still there.
The one solution Israel has not tried is the one ordered by the UN Security
Council back in 1978: a full withdrawal to the international border, leaving
the UN interim force to prevent a return of Palestinian guerrilla units to
the border zone while the Lebanese state reimposes its authority.
Yet even now the 'international community' does not insist on compliance
with that resolution. Indeed, the Security Council had nothing to say about
last week's fighting. The US seems to accept the Israeli view that this
cynical use of violence, which destroyed the homes of many thousands of
people, has somehow 'advanced the peace process'.
Meanwhile, in Geneva the EC and UN mediators, Lord Owen and Mr Thorvald
Stoltenberg, have been twisting Mr Izetbegovic's arm to get him to accept
what they and their employers have often pronounced unacceptable.
Last September, Lord Owen said: 'We have to convince the Moslems that they
are not going to be the victims of realpolitik.' Now, it seems, he is trying
to convince them of the opposite, and is irritated by suggestions that Nato
aircraft might, after all, intervene to prevent the 'strangulation' of
Sarajevo, fearing this will encourage the Moslems to hold out a little
longer.
In a Channel 4 TV interview screened on Monday night Lord Owen admitted he
could have resigned in May when the Washington conference scrapped his
previous peace plan. That plan involved a territorial partition of Bosnia on
effectively ethnic lines, but a fairer one than is now proposed, with far
fewer people being displaced. But Lord Owen apparently thought that to do so
would have been quixotic and self-indulgent.
It is a perverse sense of honour which keeps someone doing a dishonourable
job. If Lord Owen felt - as well he might - that his task had been rendered
impossible by the unwillingness of western powers to confront Serb and Croat
realpolitik, he should have resigned and said so.
As it is, he finds himself (as one who has worked closely with him remarked
last week) behaving like the character played by Alec Guinness in The Bridge
on the River Kwai: an officer in charge of a detachment of prisoners of war
who takes pride in the bridge he has built for the enemy and is horrified by
his own side's desire to blow it up.
The true nature of the new world order is becoming clear.
I know, 'new world order' was last year's cliche, or rather the year
before's. Nowadays one is supposed to talk about 'world disorder'. But even
more sinister than chaos and violence in themselves is the deliberate use of
them to bring about a new political order; and even worse than an
international community that clucks ineffectively and does nothing is one
that busies itself with dignifying such callous realpolitik with
'agreements' on which the victim must shake the hand of the aggressor.
Perhaps that is the only kind of world order there ever was, or could be,
but it leaves a very unpleasant taste in the mouth. Moreover, it is hard to
see why such agreements should last any longer than the balance of forces
which dictated them.

FT  04 AUG 93 / Letter: 'Snake' may lessen ERM's difficulties (2)
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DANIEL OPPENHEIMER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, No-one yet seems to have made the connection between the suspension of
the ERM and the debate which took place earlier this year in the FT's
letters column and 'Personal View' column over the desirability of an
independent central bank.
The episode provides excellent ammunition for both sides. Those who are
pro-independence can point out that only an independent central bank could
possibly have withstood the massive political pressure on Germany to
sacrifice its low inflation record for the sake of European unity. Those who
are anti-independence can point out how inflation is not merely a simple
'technical' issue, but a deeply political one, and can argue that it is
wrong that the (unelected) Mr Helmut Schlesinger, Bundesbank president, can
overturn the desire of (elected) politicians to move towards greater
European unity.
You pays your money and you takes your choice.

FT  04 AUG 93 / Letter: 'Snake' may lessen ERM's difficulties (1)
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr LUCIEN PETERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Rather than fixing a new and arbitrary 15 per cent fluctuation band for
most ERM currencies, ERM members might have been better off considering a
mechanism that allows for both market forces and flexible excess control.
A true 'snake' may be the answer. It could be created by first letting all
ERM currencies briefly float in order to establish a true market reference
exchange rate for currency couples and then introducing a flexible
fluctuation band around the moving average (calculated for a uniform period
of time) of each exchange rate. The boundaries for this band could be set at
one or more standard deviation of each currency couple.
This snake would let market forces act quite freely, while also allowing for
central bank intervention each time the boundaries or the flexible band are
approached or touched. This way there would hardly be any need for periodic
re-sets of rigid thresholds.

FT  04 AUG 93 / Call waiting, for the lucky few: Eastern Europe's biggest
barrier to exports is its poor telecoms system
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For every person with a telephone in Albania, six are on a waiting list. It
is better in Hungary and Poland, where there are about three in the queue
for every five installed.
Without a modern telecommunications system, east European business will be
hampered at every turn. But with existing levels of investment, its chances
of getting one in the foreseeable future are slim.
A few further figures underline the region's plight. Western Europe has an
average of 43 exchange lines per 100 people. In the east, only the Baltic
states and Bulgaria have more than 20 per 100, while the rest of the region
has between 10 and 15 per 100.
According to a recent survey by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation
and Development, east European business considers inadequate
telecommunications to be its biggest infrastructure barrier to exports. In
Poland poor telecommunications is a more frequently cited obstacle than any
other, including exchange rates and the instability of the banking sector.
CIT Research, a London communications consultancy, estimates the cost of
providing Russia and eastern Europe with the same density of exchange lines
as Spain has today - 35 per 100 people - at Dollars 129bn, or Dollars 14.3bn
a year if it were spread equally from 1992 to 2000.
The Spanish target, a rough yardstick, is far beyond the medium-term reach
of most countries in the region. According to CIT, if the telecoms growth
rate of 1988-91 were sustained, only the Baltic states and Bulgaria would
reach the Spanish target by 2000, while Russia would end the decade with 24
lines per 100, the former Czechoslovakia with 25, Hungary 20, Ukraine 18 and
Poland 14.6.
To reach 35 per 100, Poland needs an extra 10m exchange lines, at a cost of
about Dollars 20bn. Last year, according to BIS Strategic Decisions, a UK
consultancy, only Dollars 1.3bn was invested, barely half the funds needed.
To put the figures in perspective, telecoms investment in the UK will amount
to about Dollars 5bn this year, enhancing a network that already provides 45
lines per 100 people.
Western private sector capital has so far played a negligible role in
eastern Europe telecommunications. 'There are some joint ventures between
eastern and western operators, but few are in wireline services and they
constitute a very small proportion of total investments so far,' says CIT.
Criticism of international lending institutions is widespread, and not just
in the east. 'Investment is falling drastically short of necessary levels,'
says Mr Andres Bande, president of Ameritech International, the US operator.
He claims that, since the 1960s, the World Bank has lent barely Dollars 5bn
on telecommunications projects worldwide and that only 2 per cent of its
current lending is for telecoms, down from 3.6 per cent 20 years ago.
Between them, the European Investment Bank and the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development have so far lent barely Dollars 1bn for
telecoms projects in eastern Europe in the past two years.
'The World Bank should look upon central and eastern Europe as it looked
upon western Europe and Japan in the years immediately after the second
world war,' says Mr Bande. He would like to see the establishment of an
international body, called 'Worldtel', exclusively targeted at
telecommunications development.
The World Bank and the EBRD reject the criticism. 'What we need is not
Worldtel but greater private sector involvement,' says Mr Edouard Wylleman,
senior infrastructure project manager at the EBRD. 'Our job is largely to
create the conditions for that - particularly by promoting an appropriate
legal framework and pioneering new financial instruments.'
Even if Worldtel were established, its financial contribution to eastern
Europe's telecoms could only be modest. BIS estimates that only about 10 per
cent of the funds needed to upgrade the region's telecoms could reasonably
come from the multilateral lenders; the rest would have to come from
internal sources (55 per cent) and from foreign direct investment (30 per
cent).
Increased internal revenue will have to be generated largely by reforming
tariff and staffing structures to reflect costs. Faced with strong political
pressures, progress on both fronts is slow. Across the OECD, the average
ratio of installed lines to employees is 120; in eastern Europe it is
between 30 and 50. On tariffs, the picture is more mixed. Russia, for
instance, has deregulated prices; but with inflation rampant, revenue is far
below that needed to fund expansion.
Privatisation of the region's state-controlled telecoms operators is the
most likely source of substantial inward investment - supplemented by
franchise contracts for new data and cellular mobile networks, and perhaps
also for mainline network expansion.
Mr Charles Jonscher, president of the Central Europe Trust, a UK-based
consultancy, is confident that capital requirements will force the region
rapidly down the privatisation and franchise roads. He sees a three-phase
process. A monopoly of investment and service-provision by state
telecommunications utilities is giving way to joint ventures with overseas
partners. In due course he expects the state utilities to be sold, with
competition encouraged between operators.
The three phases are evident in the development of the region's cellular
mobile networks. In most countries, the first generation of cellular
networks was provided by single joint ventures between state and foreign
operators. By contrast, competing concessions are being offered for new
digital networks constructed to the pan-European GSM standard.
For entrepreneurs prepared to pay premium rates, mobile and satellite links
are developing fast. However, for mass telecommunications at affordable
prices, expanding the basic fixed network is the overriding priority. In
that sphere, progress towards Mr Jonscher's second and third phases of joint
ventures and privatisation is painfully slow in most countries.
Ideological opposition to privatisation and liberalisation remains strong.
At a recent FT conference, Mr Krzysztof Kilian, Poland's telecommunications
minister, said the (now interim) government had just 'started to think'
about privatising part of Polish telecoms. He expressed deep scepticism as
to the value of competition in basic network provision. 'Surely it is
obvious that costs will be lowest in high-capacity systems in the hands of a
single operator,' he said.
Privatisation is proceeding in Hungary, along with provision for licensing
56 regional competitors to the former monopoly. Thirteen overseas operators
have submitted proposals to take a stake in the Hungarian company, including
several leading west European and US operators.
But even if the rest of eastern Europe follows Hungary's lead, the source of
future inward investment is problematic. Companies with a total
capitalisation of Dollars 50bn are expected to come to market over the next
three years in the Asia Pacific region, where telecoms expansion is riding
on the back of buoyant economies. Then there is western Europe, where a
privatisation avalanche starts in 1995-96 with the sale of Deutsche Telekom.
'We are facing a real shortage of capital to get the industry moving in
eastern Europe,' says Mr David Wheeler, a corporate finance director at
Lehman Brothers, the merchant bank. 'It is not just rival flotations:
successful privatisations in eastern Europe will need dedicated strategic
partners, and they are in increasingly short supply.' Deutsche Telekom has a
particularly strong interest in the region, but with a DM70bn (Dollars
40.8bn) bill for modernising the network in the eastern German Lander, it
has little spare cash.
If that seems unduly gloomy, the Asia Pacific region might offer an
alternative model. There, economies took off and advanced telecommunications
are following. Alas, there is no sign of such a take-off in eastern Europe -
with or without the telephones.

FT  04 AUG 93 / Letter: Role in private sector projects essential for
success of the EBRD
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ANDREW KLINOFF
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, While I might agree with your assertion that the ideal candidate for
the presidency of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development
(EBRD) should combine the qualities of Messrs Balcerowicz, de Larosiere,
Stern and Lady Thatcher with 'knowledge of the economic task ahead,
impeccable integrity and political weight' (Leading article: 'New leader for
EBRD', July 22), I must disagree with some of your other conclusions.
That Europe may have 'no shortage of private merchant bankers' may be true.
But how many are operating in eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union?
And, indeed, how many can really afford to, given the opportunity costs?
Does anyone seriously believe that most governments or companies in the
region can pay for the advisory services of Morgan Stanley or Warburgs? Or
need the services in which they truly excel, such as bond and equity issues,
derivatives and M&amp;A?
A public sector merchant bank could, on the other hand, provide those
services that are needed in the region, such as restructuring and
privatisation advice, plus fresh cash to local privatised firms and to those
few foreign investors willing to risk some of their own money in projects in
eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union.
More fundamentally, however - and in contrast to what you say - lending to
private projects is not only a necessary and a sufficient condition for the
development of healthy economies based on the private sector. It is the only
viable way for an institution of the size and scope of the EBRD. (When fully
disbursed, EBRD assets will total about USDollars 12bn. The World Bank total
is nearly Dollars 140bn, while Dai-Ichi-Kangyo, the largest bank in the
world, holds more than Dollars 450bn])
Only through structuring and investing in private sector projects can the
EBRD simultaneously help to attract more foreign investors, finance
infrastructure, formulate policy, and develop institutions and a viable
legal framework.
Such issues as policy formulation, in eastern Europe and the former Soviet
Union, can be dealt with only through concrete examples of live projects
that will lead to Bank financing. And unless such issues are resolved as
part of a concrete project, they simply result in theoretical discussions.
To question this approach, and suggest that the EBRD be organised by
countries, with a country or sector strategy determining what the Bank does,
seems reasonable. But it is not. The private sector and the market work in
their own way to allocate resources and reward risk and entrepreneurship.
Communist countries allocated resources through a central plan based on
country and sector strategies. This didn't work for them, so why should it
work for the EBRD?

Sir, One further invaluable thing Robert Horton will bring with him to
Railtrack ('Hatchet honed to a softer point', July 31/August 1) is a solid
commitment to equal opportunities. From interviewing him at BP for the
European Commission video, 'The glass ceiling breakers', I'd rate him in my
list of top 10 males in industry, along with BT's Iain Vallance, who really
believe companies will be more successful if women are treated, trained and
promoted on equal terms with male colleagues.

FT  04 AUG 93 / Letter: Greater beneficiaries of Uruguay round
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ADRIAN HEWITT and Ms SHEILA PAGE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Richard Blackhurst (Letters, August 2) points out that a Uruguay round
settlement will bring net gains in trade leading to absolute gains in income
and employment in the US and European Community. The gains for many
developing countries may be proportionally even greater.
Developing countries will gain from the rise in world income for all the
reasons outlined by Mr Blackhurst. But they have an additional interest
because this round has for the first time included two sectors, agriculture
and textiles and clothing, that did not benefit from the reductions in
barriers achieved by other goods in previous rounds. These sectors are those
of greatest interest to developing countries, which are seeking to sustain
export expansion without succumbing to 'jobless growth'.
On the basis of the Dunkel Draft settlement, the Overseas Development
Institute (in The Gatt Uruguay Round: Effects on Developing Countries) has
estimated that the effects from these net export gains alone would be at
least 3 per cent of the value of their exports (equivalent to Dollars 25bn),
and could well be twice that. These figures in turn could be doubled by
effects from the income gains to their industrial country trading partners,
and the wage advantage for export production over local markets is probably
even greater for them.
This explains why so many developing countries are participating fully in
the Uruguay round negotiations for the first time.
They have viewed the recent US-EC stand-off on agricultural protection with
irritation at being treated as bystanders at what they hope will be a feast
for all.

Gunsmoke began in the US on CBS Radio in 1952 with William Conrad (now best
known as 'Cannon' the fat detective) playing Marshal Matt Dillon. When CBS
decided on a TV version they asked John Wayne to play the part but, not
wanting to commit himself to a weekly television series, Wayne suggested a
relatively unknown young friend for the role: James Arness. The first TV
episode was screened in 1955 and Arness, even taller than his mentor at 6 ft
7 ins, went on to make hundreds of episodes: there were 512 before the show
ended in 1975, by which time it had inspired and outlasted dozens of other
Western series. On BBC2 at 6.50 Arness stars in the episode 'Gunfighter,
RIP'.
Reporting from Zambia, On The Line (8.30 BBC2) considers the position of the
World Cup squad in a soccer-mad nation whose national team was killed in an
air crash in April. Radio 4 begins a series called Accidents Will Happen
which looks at the more metaphysical aspects of seemingly haphazard events:
coincidences of the sort which most people have experienced and so many feel
to have been more than mere chance (8.45).

FT  04 AUG 93 / Arts: 'Il Trittico' and 'The Rake' - Spoleto Festival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM WEAVER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The first-time visitor to the Spoleto Festival had best obey two rules: wear
sound, rubber-soled shoes (the steep, cobbled lanes of the lovely Umbrian
town are treacherously slippery); and expect the unexpected. From the time
Gian Carlo Menotti founded it, the Festival of Two Worlds  - as he
officially calls it - has aimed not only to bring Italy and the Western
hemisphere together, but also to foster young talent, encourage artists to
explore new paths, and cajole the traditionally staid and unadventurous
Italian audience to open its mind and eyes to unfamiliar experiences.
As the Festival approaches the end of its 36th year, Menotti deservedly
looks back on his achievements with pride. But as he ruefully admits, there
have also been some monumental fiascos, like the Visconti Traviata in which
the soprano lost her voice before opening night, when, to make matters
worse, the tenor got completely lost in the final act. But, to compensate
for that awful evening - one of Visconti's worst, too - there were occasions
like the Visconti-Schippers Manon Lescaut, a brief, unforgettable recital in
the little Teatro Caio Melisso by the unknown Jessye Norman, and the Italian
debut of the Tokyo Quartet in the same house.
For Spoleto's operagoers this year's festival may well be memorable chiefly
for the debut here of a young Chilean soprano, Cristina Gallardo Domas,
whose Suor Angelica provided the one real excitement in an otherwise
enjoyable, but uneven production of Puccini's Trittico, designed by William
Orlandi, staged by Menotti and conducted by Spoleto's new musical director,
Steven Mercurio.
Of Puccini's works Il Trittico is one of the most problematical; the three
short, intense operas are filled with traps for the unwary. In Il tabarro
Mercurio and his leading singers decided on a full-blast approach,
everything at top volume, addressed squarely at the public. Well, the score
is rich and can survive and even repay this unsubtle, but sincere handling.
As Michele, the baritone Haijing Fu stood out, sombre and moving and
sinister, implacable as well. It was good to see the lovers, Giorgetta
(Maria Prosperi) and Luigi (Rick Moon), played unromantically, she rather
dowdy, he ordinary, plain. The set was misty, a traditional, recognisable,
handsome Paris.
Menotti's staging was also traditional, with some of the master's familiar
trademarks, including abundant employment of supers. Since Puccini wrote a
number of vignettes into the work, the stage at times seemed overcrowded, as
if Michele had dropped anchor near the Gare de Lyon. The cloister of Suor
Angelica was no more cluttered than necessary, and the girls of the
Westminster Choir formed a convincing, varied community of nuns. The
interpreter of Anglica ideally must have, besides a warm, supple, melting
voice, an expressive face; and Gallardo Domas, while not beautiful in any
conventional sense, has the biggest eyes seen on the opera stage since
Callas. Though short of stature, she took on heroic dimensions in the
conclusion of the piece, from the aria 'Senza mamma', her delivery powerful
yet nuanced, to the last gasp of her death.
Comic opera is always a problem for inexperienced singers, and most of the
Gianni Schicchi cast succumbed to the temptation to mug outrageously. The
immensely tall, gangling Alan Held has an impressive voice, but he is not -
or, at least, not yet - a Schicchi, lacking that vein of cynical cruelty
that belongs to the character. Nevertheless, the work moved fast and
securely, and held the public. The Spoleto Festival Orchestra was, as usual,
composed of very young players, students or recent conservatory graduates.
Inevitably, the quality varies from one festival to the next and, it must be
said, 1993 was not a vintage year. Mercurio - not well received by the
Italian press - seemed to have clear ideas about the music and he set
suitable tempos, allowing the singers just the right amount of liberty. But
his players, notably a pesky, shrill piccolo, occasionally did him a
disservice and the sound was not always pleasant.
The other opera on the Spoleto calendar, Stravinsky's Rake's Progress, made
use of a much-reduced orchestra and the conductor - another young American,
Arthur Fagen - was able to draw more focused playing from this smaller
group. The Caio Melisso is about the size of the Theatre Royal, Wexford, and
like its Irish counterpart, the Italian house flatters voices, so singers
can relax. Thus, while neither the tenor Michael Rees Davis nor the soprano
Ann Christine Larsson seems to have a large instrument, neither had to
force; and Stravinsky's sinuous lines emerged with spontaneity and
sweetness. Larsson's enunciation was sometimes blurred, but she was a
touching Anne; Davis made every vowel and consonant do its job, and the
splendid poetry made the proper effect.
Richard Cowan's Nick had a bold swagger and a black sound; his
interpretation was a hampered by his too-obvious costume. The costumes and
the sets were by the British caricaturist-cartoonist-illustrator David
Hughes, making his first foray into opera. His designs, somewhere between
Steinberg and Hockney, displayed a ready wit and a fertile imagination, but
they occasionally went off the rails (why did the crowd at the auction have
to wear bird-beaks?). Roman Terleckyj, who has on many occasions acted as
Menotti's assistant, staged the work in harmony with Hughes's vision. There
were some excellent moments - the finale, with the singers removing their
makeup at a row of mirrors, for example - while other scenes, Bedlam for
one, were filled with aimless bustle.

FT  04 AUG 93 / Arts: 'Time of my Life' - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Always be wary of plays that dot about with chronology, moving backwards and
forwards as the tale unfolds. There must be a suspicion that the device is
used because the plot would not stand up if it were told in a
straightforward way.
Alan Ayckbourn's Time Of My Life, slightly tightened up since it was first
performed at Scarborough last year, just about pulls it off, but immediately
there is another caution. This is not the Ayckbourn who was wont to set the
house upon a roar with laughter. Time Of My Life stems more from the Alan
Bennett school of Talking Heads. It is a play about sad, not very well
educated people who do not always understand themselves, let alone each
other. The overwhelming impression is that life is hard, not comic.
True, there are flashes when the old (or rather the younger) Ayckbourn is
immediately identifiable. There is the wonderful part of Maureen the
hairdresser, quite superbly played by Sophie Heyman. Maureen is not educated
at all. She has only three books in her possession, but she can certainly be
articulate. Every time Ms Heyman appears she has an even more exaggerated
punk hair style. Possibly because she is the outsider, she manages to
survive without undue tristesse, though it is notable that throughout the
piece the women tend to be tougher than the men.
The rest of the cast make up an unhappy family. The Strattons own a northern
building firm which may have cut corners and is now falling on hard times.
Still, Gerry Stratton - played by Anton Rodgers - is celebrating his wife's
birthday in the restaurant which the family has always used and where it
again assembles for the occasion. Gradually, truths come out. Gerry's wife
Laura (Gwen Taylor) confesses to having had a 15 minute-fling (if that is
not too strong a word) with another man in 1974 - her only infidelity in 32
years of marriage.
Then there is the inquest. 'We bought single beds in August 1970,' Laura
says. 'It's engraved on my memory. I remember saying to myself 'goodbye the
swinging sixties'.' And perhaps, given the title, that is what the play is
about. The earlier Ayckbourn was never so sombre. Even the set, confined to
the northern restaurant, is designed to be drab. Gerry thinks he can drive
confidently home, but is killed in a car crash; Laura survives.
Being Ayckbourn, of course, there are some depths and ironies. The
characters sometimes believe they are happy when they are not and claim to
be honest when they are no such thing. It is not deliberate hypocrisy, but
rather a tortuous muddle. The grown up Stratton children turn out to make
even less of a success of their lives than their parents, possibly
(remembering Philip Larkin's line about the effects of Mum and Dad) because
of their parents.
Some sections of the play are below standard, notably the suggestion that
foreign waiters in a restaurant are funny just because they are foreign. In
short, a bit of a hotch-potch. Ayckbourn directs himself.

FT  04 AUG 93 / Arts: Richard Strauss celebrated - Opera in San Francisco
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIMOTHY PFAFF
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is a particular as well as a general pity that the Celebration of Richard
Strauss that just ended is, for budget reasons, the last San Francisco Opera
summer season for the foreseeable future. Since, despite an adequately high
level of singing throughout the festival, there were no standout
performances in major roles, the company's orchestra emerged the festival's
'star.' Now it seems that without this valuable performance and rehearsal
time with its new music director, Donald Runnicles (who conducted Salome and
Capriccio), and principal guest, Charles Mackerras (who led Der
Rosenkavalier), the opera orchestra can only suffer.
The ensemble's alert responses to the full complement of Strauss styles  -
early, middle, and late - as well to three conductors (Andrew Davis led two
concert performances of Daphne), was appreciable. But its craft and
versatility shone brightest in adversity: having to sound at full cry for
Salome while holding back to accommodate the severely compromised
performance of Maria Ewing in the title role.
The old question of whether it was wise for Ewing to take up the role for
the by now much-travelled Peter Hall production seems answerable in an
unambiguous 'No.' Not only can the Ewing soprano no longer soar over the
full orchestra at climaxes, it skips over many of the 'little notes' that
lend the role so much of its musical interest. From performance to
performance (I heard two), Ewing recomposed the part for her comfort; little
wonder that, her famous strip to the buff notwithstanding, the most
memorable part of her Salome is her pout.
The Herods, king and queen, fared far better, with both Robert Tear and
Leonie Rysanek giving sophisticated, richly detailed vocal and dramatic
readings - and Rysanek sounding as if she could have sung the title role
with ease (and the vocal generosity she always lent it). If Tom Fox's
Jokanaan lacked a certain aura of mystery, it was still strong and
impressive - even if the often misguided restaging by Jeanette Aster gave us
a prophet who could not keep his eyes off the sultry princess.
Elevating his orchestra to the status of another character, Runnicles
presided over a drama of feral cunning and thrust. What his Salome offered
in sound and fury, his Capriccio delivered in subtlety and nuance. Except
for some occasionally faulty intonation from the strings his players
produced a shimmering tapestry of sound: fine filigree over a gracefully
suspended long line. Co-ordination between pit and stage was exemplary.
Revisions to the Mauro Pagano production, similarly familiar to London
audiences from a previous Covent Garden outing, will be revealed in a live
video recording. In general it seemed improved by Thierry Bosquet's period
costumes, replacing the misogynist Versace designs that lent visual
confusion to the original production.
Kiri Te Kanawa sounded better too; by now having learned the role in its
particulars, she singing it half-ardently. Still, opulent sounds and arching
phrases were not enough to convince one that she had strong, let alone
conflicted, feelings about either words or music, poet or composer - or, for
that matter, much interest in dinner. (The production's one genuinely
touching performance was Michel Senechal's show-stopping Monsieur Taupe.)
Hakan Hagegard, as the Count, and Victor Braun, as La Roche, made similar,
if paler, impressions compared with their first outings in this production.
While David Kuebler caught neither the character of Flamand nor his music,
Simon Keenlyside compensated with a beautifully inflected, deeply
sympathetic Olivier - one that tipped the balance in the direction of words
with, however ironically, high musicality. Still, the most fullest, most
rewarding characterisation was Tatiana Troyanos' text-savoring, handsomely
sung Clairon.
The already grateful pairing of Capriccio and Der Rosenkavalier was further
enhanced by a similarity in production style. Lotfi Mansouri's 'new'
Rosenkavalier sought to recreate both the Alfred Roller designs of the
Dresden premiere and the original staging as reflected in the production
book. The sets emerged breath-catchingly, absorbingly beautiful, the
direction a bit by the numbers and characteristically broad and physical.
Felicity Lott introduced an accurate, well defined, patrician, and
ultimately unmoving Marschallin; Frederica von Stade her well-known, urgent
Octavian (though a bit vocally constricted and, well, more mannish than
boyish in her late San Francisco debut of the role); and Christina Schaefer
a perky if small-voiced Sophie. Eric Halvorson's sumptuously voiced Ochs
seemed otherwise generic.
Musically, the show belonged to Mackerras, who seemed unerring in his
choices of what to accent in this busiest of scores ' while making sure that
all its music told. His sympathy with the singers seemed sometimes
finer-grained than theirs with their characters.
In the event, the concert Daphne seemed a trifle pointless (if not a
pointless trifle). Davis oversaw a performance that seemed sufficiently
long-lined, rhapsodic, and airy - but that felt more a reflection of what
the orchestra could accomplish with little rehearsal than a serious reading
of the work. The only singing of lasting interest was Jon Frederic West's
knowing, passionate Apollo and Janice Watson's silvery (if somewhat
monochrome) Daphne.

FT  04 AUG 93 / Arts: Ethos of vans, doors and Bosnia - Television
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER DUNKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the second week of July, according to the BARB ratings, 'Other Viewing',
which means programmes on satellite and cable, achieved its highest share
ever in Britain: 6.6 per cent. So conventional terrestrial television - BBC,
ITV and Channel 4 - still accounted for 93.4 per cent. Thus the notion which
now appears to obsess the chattering classes within the mass media, that we
are in the middle of a new age of multiple choice which is baffling and
fragmenting the audience, seems a teeny bit questionable. Of course this
does not stop the broadcasters behaving as though the notion is a fact, and
one of their favourite ways of attempting to resist the supposed
fragmentation is 'theming': dedicating a whole evening to programmes about
food, flinging together two dozen programmes about dinosaurs, or, as on
Channel 4 at present, devoting a whole week to programmes about 'Bloody
Bosnia' - pun fully intended.
At first the idea seemed admirable. Thanks to bitty and repetitive coverage
of violent activity in what was Yugoslavia, television has produced a
weariness in many viewers; a tendency to mutter 'a plague on all your houses
and your medieval mentality'. The sight of yet another reporter in a flak
jacket standing in front of yet another burned out Balkan village has become
the signal to change channels. Surely this uncharitable and obscurantist
reaction might be changed by a more intelligent, analytical and historical
approach to the subject. 'Bloody Bosnia' could be just what was needed.
Yet a combination of pre-viewing and viewing off-air at the start of this
themed week leaves doubts. The whole thing could backfire and leave us more
sick of the subject than ever. It seemed odd to begin with a lecture by
currency manipulator George Soros, of all people, on ethics. Still, to be
fair, he can claim to have spent some of the millions he made in speculating
against the pound and the dollar on liberal and humane charities in the area
in question. Moreover the idea underlying his Opinions programme was wholly
laudable: that we need a new world order based on 'the open society where no
dogma has a monopoly, where the individual is not at the mercy of the state,
and where minorities and minority opinions are respected'.
But as the season continues one's patience starts to thin. In some cases
such as the Essential Guide series (Part 2 last night, Part 3 tomorrow) it
is the style, with its flickering captions, head-and-shoulder inlays, and
general tone of 'Look at me I'm in charge of graphics' which irritates and
distracts from the content. In other instances it is the message: Guardian
reporter Maggie O'Kane made it utterly clear in Sunday's Frontline that she
sees Slobodan Milosevic in particular and the Serbs in general as the demons
of the piece. But did her silence on the Moslems indicate that she thought
them blameless? In other places Western liberals tend to find Moslem
intolerance and totalitarianism loathesome; are they different in Bosnia? I
have an ominous feeling that by the end of the week we shall be growling 'A
plague on all your houses' every time another of these programmes appears.
The past week has produced vivid contrasts in documentary styles. The first
in the BBC2 series Architecture Of The Imagination (reviewed here at greater
length by Colin Amery on Monday) was one of those portentous programmes
where the commentary swings between the blindingly obvious and the
embarrassingly pretentious. It was full of people keen to explain to lesser
mortals the inner, and of course outer, significance and symbolism of the
door. The first in ITV's Metroland series, showing work by new directors,
could easily have fallen into the same trap. In his 25 minute study of the
world of van drivers Henry Chancellor did have one enthusiast who sat on the
step of (I think) a Dormobile and mused about what would probably, in the
architecture series, have been called the 'ethos' of vans.
But Chancellor's commentator was brief, ready to laugh at his own
fanaticism, and amusing - virtues which describe the entire programme. We
watched a hairdresser, a fishmonger and a dentist operating from vans. We
met the sort of loons who customise Bedfords so that they do 150 mph and
eight mpg. And we ended with a student living in a van whose simple analysis
of its significance was far more effective than all the psychobabble in
Architecture Of The Imagination. 'The Van' is the sort of startlingly simple
but affecting programme to which juries like to give awards.
Lady Elspeth Howe, wife of Conservative grandee Sir Geoffrey Howe, has
succeeded Lord Rees-Mogg as chairman of the Broadcasting Standards Council,
one of the sillier quangos invented in recent years by a government
supposedly keen to 'roll back the boundaries of the state'. Jobs for the
girls? Perish the thought] The lady is there entirely on merit. Chief
qualification for chairmanship of the BSC appears to be a very sketchy
knowledge of what actually appears on television. Rees-Mogg proved by what
he told interviewers to be eminently qualified, and now, in response to
Christian Tyler's question 'Do you enjoy watching sex on television? Do you
find it boring?' in the course of a feature in Saturday's Weekend FT, Lady
Howe has said 'Up to a point. Yes I do after a while find it boring if it
goes on and on and on'.
So here is a challenge for the lady: name us, not 12, not six, but just two
occasions in the past year - no, let's make it fair, in the past decade -
when you have seen a programme in which sex went on and on and on. Those of
us who would welcome a gentle spot of sex occasionally in place of some of
the stabbing and shooting would be delighted to know where, outside the
Adult Channel on the Astra satellite (and somehow it seems unlikely that
Lady Howe is paying Pounds 50 a year for that) she claims to be finding such
unremitting sex.
Speaking of sex, when will television newsroom staffs get it through their
thick collective heads that they have no more idea than anybody else of the
rate of sexual offences in Britain (or England, or, as reported on BBC
Regional News last week, London). Sex offences were almost certainly higher,
proportionately, in London in 1493 than today, and probably higher in 1893,
what with middle class male attitudes towards servant girls. But nobody
knows. All that television news reporters know is the state of police
statistics, and these vary according to the number of police collecting
them, the number of computers available, and especially according to
prevailing attitudes towards the reporting of crime. It is, of course, less
exciting and less terrifying to announce 'The number of sexual offences
reported to the police rose last year' than to scream 'There was a rise of
11 per cent in sex offences in London last year'. The difference, however,
is that the former is non-fiction, which is what television news is supposed
to deal in, whereas the latter is fiction.
How splendid to be reminded so forcefully by the opening production in
BBC2's Wexford Trilogy of what can be done with a simple single-set studio
drama if you have a writer as good as Billy Roche. BBC1's two-part thriller
Thicker Than Water had some of the best wet-windscreen scenes shot on any
location this year, but never at any point did the dialogue or the drama
achieve the same power as 'Poor Beast In The Rain'. This opening episode in
the Wexford sequence told a bleak story of provincial pride and tragedy with
speed, wit and economy and was consequently spellbinding. Yet it never moved
beyond the confines of a small betting shop.

FT  04 AUG 93 / People: Taking the wheel at Cosworth
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Vickers has turned to the Rover group to fill two gaps in the top management
of its Cosworth Engineering subsidiary.
Chris Woodwark is ending a 22-year career with Rover and British Leyland, to
take over as chief executive of Cosworth, while Rob Oldaker, Rover's chief
chassis engineer, is to become engineering director for Cosworth's road
engines.
Woodwark is making a big leap to the world of high performance engine
manufacturing from his present role as managing director of Rover
International, where he has been responsible most recently for sales of
Rover and Land Rover vehicles in all markets outside Europe. His appointment
follows the retirement of Peter Nevitt.
Unlike Nevitt, a respected engineer, Woodwark's career has been almost
exclusively spent on the commercial side of British Leyland and Rover.
He joined British Leyland in international marketing in 1971, and later held
jobs such as sales director for Land Rover in Africa, managing director of
Leyland Zimbabwe and sales and marketing director of Leyland Trucks.
The post at Cosworth will now keep him firmly in touch with the North
American market, where he has enjoyed mixed fortunes in recent years. He has
currently been planning a big expansion for Land Rover in North America with
the expected launch there next year of the successful Discovery fourwheel
drive vehicle.
At end of the 1980s, however, his US experience was less happy as he
struggled in vain to turn the tide for Sterling Motors, Rover's abortive car
sales venture in the US.
At Cosworth, the outlook is more promising, with Nigel Mansell driving
successfully with the Ford Cosworth engine in US IndyCar racing, and
Cosworth profits doing their best to compensate for the losses at Vickers'
other automotive businesses, most notably Rolls-Royce Motor Cars.

FT  04 AUG 93 / Management: Race to the top - Initiatives to boost the
number of black managers in South African companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATTI WALDMEIR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After 350 years of racial segregation, corporate South Africa is facing the
stark fact that 5m whites cannot manage a nation of 40m people - especially
once the other 35m have the political power to insist on a piece of the
action.
So South African corporations, most of which have been agnostic on the
question of black advancement, are rapidly embracing affirmative action.
Last month the South African Chamber of Business, the employers' federation,
called on its members to put affirmative action programmes in place
urgently, clearly fearful that a new government might otherwise impose
racial quotas.
Like their counterparts in other countries, South African managers are
struggling to balance the demands of shareholders with the needs of society.
Most nations face the problem of how to remove inequalities in the corporate
world, but few face it in such stark and daunting form as South Africa.
Discrimination has affected the vast majority of employees - not a small
minority, as in the US - and government policy has deliberately nurtured a
vast skills gap between the managers and the managed.
'Any company that wants to survive is looking at affirmative action,' says
Wendy Luhabe, whose company, Bridging the Gap, tries to place candidates in
companies seeking to advance blacks.
No black-led government can be expected to accept the status quo: that less
than 3 per cent of managers are black. And although the African National
Congress says it wishes to avoid legislated racial quotas, expectations are
high.
The National African Federated Chamber of Commerce, the black business
federation, has demanded that blacks hold 30 per cent of seats on the boards
of all listed companies by 2000. It also wants blacks to hold 40 per cent of
equity and 60 per cent of posts at all management levels. No major South
African corporation comes anywhere near these targets - except National
Sorghum Breweries, set up recently when the government privatised its
monopoly, Sorghum Brewing Company, under black ownership and management.
The small number of blacks in business reflects not only prejudice but also
a severe shortage of qualified black candidates after years of sub-standard
education under apartheid. Still, some companies such as South African
Breweries (SAB) have a long track record of affirmative action and provide
an example for those just starting out.
In the group's beer division 46 per cent of salaried employees are black, up
from 13 per cent in 1978; and 16 per cent of senior managers are black.
Executive chairman Meyer Kahn, whose forceful personality and blunt charm
have done much to promote the affirmative action programme, has set what he
calls headcount targets. By 1995 each of the group's operating companies
must have at least one black executive director (there are none at present);
by 1997 20 per cent of senior managers must be black; and by 2000 all
salaried staff must 'reflect the demography of South Africa', which means 80
per cent must be non-white.
Kahn sets out the lessons from the past decade's efforts. 'Job segmentation
is the answer to affirmative action,' he says. 'When the world was going for
job enlargement, we restructured jobs into smaller modules that were more
do-able.' That means, for example, splitting the traditional job of finance
director into two functions: accounting and treasury management.
Black candidates exist to fill the accounting position but lack the
experience to perform both jobs at once. Reducing the workload of the job
can also help. A relatively inexperienced sales manager has a better chance
of success if given seven rather than 15 representatives to manage.
An internal SAB document sets out some dos and don'ts of affirmative action.
Among them: do not window dress, and make clear to new recruits that 'your
black skin is no passport'; 'don't go overboard to accommodate black power
blocs - stand up for what is right, businesswise'; encourage mentoring,
preferably by the immediate boss; impress on whites the reality of the
current political situation and weed out obstructors; root out covert and
overt racism; and try to make blacks feel they belong.
The document offers some recruitment hints. Choose 'trouble-shooters and
arguers' rather than passive and pliable people who 'know their place'; look
out for cultural bias in selection techniques; choose those who can identify
with free enterprise - many blacks suspect big business of having colluded
with apartheid and black communities sometimes equate success with
co-option.
But as Joe Horner, consultant to SAB on affirmative action, argues, no real
progress will be made unless managers understand that advancing black
colleagues is an essential part of their job. 'You must make clear to
managers that they will be judged by how well they ensure blacks succeed,
that it's as important as cost cutting and profits. You must audit this
policy as rigorously as you do financial audits. And you must make clear to
line managers that they . . . must devote a large amount of high-quality
personal time to coaching.'
Public-sector bodies such as the electricity utility Eskom also have lessons
to offer. Dawn Mokhobo, head of the Eskom's department of social
harmonisation, says the utility has established a sort of shadow management
board composed of black senior general managers who will not attend regular
weekly board meetings but will join special extended board sessions each
month.
'It's a way of getting people into the system,' she says, adding that this
method creates a pool of candidates from which future black board members
can be drawn.
To expand the pool of qualified black managers in general, Eskom is
spearheading an initiative with big private-sector companies to provide
fast-track training for 80-100 people from 8-10 large corporations, at a
cost of R3m (Pounds 500,000) per corporation.
As Harry Oppenheimer, the patriarch of South African business, says: 'It's
extremely dangerous to be ruled by people who have no material stake in the
country . . . we've got to see that people in the majority have as large a
share in the material assets of the country as we can.'

FT  04 AUG 93 / Management: Acquiring a taste for the local cuisine - Dr
Carol Cooper advises the business traveller abroad to take precautions when
sampling certain foods / Health Check
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Dr CAROL COOPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ENJOYING hospitality and sampling local cuisine are part and parcel of
business trips abroad. While travel may broaden the mind, many people know
that it can also loosen the bowels. About 40 per cent of travellers suffer
from acute gastro-intestinal upsets.
Delhi Belly, Gyppy Tummy and their variants may last only three days, but
when chasing a vital contract these could be the most important days in the
calendar.
The risk of acute diarrhoea is highest in developing countries and around
the Mediterranean. Although often said to be due to a change in the water,
traveller's diarrhoea is spread by something more specific in the water -
viruses, bacteria and parasites which originate in human faeces and
contaminate water supplies, and therefore food and drink.
More serious infections, such as typhoid, cholera, salmonellosis and
hepatitis A, are transmitted by this route too. Many of these can be
prevented. The golden rule is to avoid salads, raw vegetables, unpeeled
fruit, tap water, ice, ice-cream, prawns, shellfish and raw fish. Salads are
often unwashed, or rinsed in contaminated water and some are also grown with
the aid of human manure.
Ice and ice-cream may be made from dubious water supplies, while prawns and
raw fish, especially in the Mediterranean, come from contaminated sea-water.
Bear in mind that you need to stay fit until the last minute; on many trips
nothing is clinched until moments before you head for the airport and your
flight home. Keeping the visiting businessman on tenterhooks till the end is
a well-known negotiating tactic.
It is wise to steer clear of sauces or anything else left out for long
periods on the table and of any dishes which look fiddly, as if many hands
have lovingly arranged each plate.
Beware, too, of unpasteurised milk. TB and brucellosis are the main problems
here, not diarrhoea.
Food that is heavily contaminated with microbes need not look, smell, or
taste 'off'. In fact the reverse may be true, because rotting food sometimes
inhibits the growth of germs that transmit diarrhoea. As long as it is eaten
immediately, well-cooked food is safe, since high temperatures for more than
15 minutes kill most microbes.
When offered steak, ask for medium or well-done: meat should be brown all
the way through, without a trace of red. Freshly cooked rice, stews, bread
and thoroughly cooked eggs are almost universally safe options. Chips, which
have to be freshly cooked, are too.
Fruit peeled by yourself - with a clean knife - should cause no problem. It
helps to wash hands before eating, but beware of grubby handtowels
afterwards (kept in a pocket, a small packet of antiseptic wipes or even
baby wipes is useful). Avoid eating with your fingers if possible, or else
discard the bit you have handled.
It is easy to decline cold snacks, but not so business lunches. If you are
worried about eating something too exotic, let your hosts order for you.
They will help you find something acceptable to western palates.
Faced with a suspect meal, one can diplomatically claim tiredness, jet-lag,
illness or allergy. In serious cases you could say that you are,
regrettably, following strict instructions from your specialist. The locals
may find you slightly eccentric, but then a moment's embarrassment is better
than 72 hours spent contemplating the tiles in the hotel bathroom. In the
Arab world and elsewhere, repeated entreaties to eat can make refusal out of
the question. In that case, have a small portion - tiny helpings contain
fewer germs.
In developing countries, tap water can be made safe by boiling or adding
iodine or chlorine - fine for brushing teeth, but impossible when lunching
out. Mineral water is available almost everywhere and the sparkling variety
is less likely to have been refilled straight from tap or river. Or order
Coca Cola, which is said to have done more for the eradication of cholera
than any health programme.
Ice is a bad idea. Research confirms that spirits do not kill the germs in
it, so it is probably better to have whisky and fizzy mineral water, or gin
and tonic, both without ice.
A visit to the chemist is wise before the trip. If you do succumb to
gastroenteritis, loperamide (Imodium) can help. It sometimes prolongs the
illness, but makes it milder.
Rehydration fluids (for example, Rehidrat, Dioralyte, Electrolade) help
replace fluids lost and make one feel better. They have to be made up with
water. Boiled water is best, but suspect water is better than none. Or have
plenty of soups and fruit juices and bananas, which contain potassium.
Carbohydrates in bread, rice and crackers also help shorten attacks of
diarrhoea. Diarrhoea containing blood or mucus needs medical attention, as
does a high fever.
Antibiotics cure almost all attacks of travellers' diarrhoea. However, they
can have side-effects, including allergy and diarrhoea, so their use is
controversial. It may be worthwhile for a business traveller with a
pre-existing disease to take them, either continuously for the duration of
the voyage, or in case problems develop. As they're prescription-only
medicines, negotiating with the GP is necessary.

FT  04 AUG 93 / People: Littlewoods appoints thwarted purchaser
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Littlewoods Home Shopping Group has invited Harald Schroff, who is retiring
from the main board of the German mail-order house Quelle as he turns 60
this September, to join its board as a non-executive director.
There are still relatively few continental Europeans on the boards of
British companies, though earlier this year Budgens appointed Hans Reischl,
chief executive of Rewe, the German supermarket chain, to its board.
Quelle, which like Littlewoods, is an unlisted, family-run company, had been
one of several parties interested in buying into the British market by
acquiring Littlewoods' home shopping business. Months of negotiations were
however broken off in April last year when the Liverpool-based retailing and
football pools group appeared to be unable to secure what it regarded as a
suitable price. At that stage the company said it therefore intended to
develop home shopping as one of its core businesses.
Yesterday Littlewoods confirmed that it had got to know Schroff as a result
of the talks, and that, as he was possibly the most experienced executive in
the field of European home shopping, it hoped to gain from his expertise.
Joining Quelle in 1957, Schroff had had a seat on the main board since 1980.
In 1986, he was put in charge of the special mail order division as well as
all of Quelle's activities outside Germany, which includes France, Austria
and Belgium.
When Littlewoods restructured at the beginning of the year, creating the
home shopping and other groups out of what had previously been internal
divisions, it said it would appoint non-executive directors to the boards of
the new limited companies, when the right people came along. Schroff is the
first such appointment.

FT  04 AUG 93 / Business and the Environment: Mines make a clean sweep -
Peru's biggest copper producer is taking the lead in reducing industrial
pollution
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SALLY BOWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Measured in terms of biodiversity, Peru is one of the world's richest
countries. But economically it is one of the world's poorest, having
suffered a GDP collapse of around 25 per cent in the past six years. For
most Peruvian companies, concern for environmental issues is a luxury they
cannot afford.
But the environmental theme looks certain to gain prominence in the near
future. Privatisation of state-owned mining companies is under way and the
government is pursuing an aggressive policy of encouraging foreign
investment in natural resources.
Multinational concerns embarking on mining or petroleum ventures in Peru
will be bound by a self-imposed code of ethics to apply the same
environmental standards in Peru as they do in, for example, Canada, Finland
or Australia.
The environmental lead in Peru is being taken by Southern Peru Copper
Corporation, the country's largest privately owned company and responsible
for two-thirds of all national copper output. SPCC is majority-owned by
Asarco of the US, while Phelps Dodge and Newmont Mining have minority
holdings.
SPCC's environmental initiative is not entirely voluntary. In 1987, a
commission was appointed by the government to investigate repeated
complaints of air and water pollution caused by the company's smelter
complex at Ilo, the port town 600 miles south of Lima, from which SPCC
refines and ships blister (almost pure) copper.
Eighteen months ago settlement was reached between SPCC and the
administration of President Alberto Fujimori over a long-standing
contractual dispute inherited from the previous government. Under the
agreement, SPCC committed itself to investing Dollars 300m (Pounds 200m)
over five years - a third for environmental improvement work and the
remainder for general expansion and investment in two new plants.
North of the Ilo smelter site - on a coastline that is home to sea birds and
seals - is a long, pitch-black beach. Years of slag dumped from the smelter
first into the ocean, then on the shore, has been swept along by currents
and deposited a couple of kilometres away.
Another problem is the tailings from SPCC's two mines, 70 miles away in the
mountains to the east. At a rate of 86,000 metric tonnes a day, they are
channelled down to the coast where they spill into the bay, forming a large
artificial beach over a mile long. Fortunately, SPCC's ore is largely free
from toxic impurities but substantial percentages of mineral solids remain.
'Worldwide, dumping tailings is just not acceptable anymore,' says Eric
Ivey, general production manager. 'We have to accept our responsibility.'
Exhaustive studies are under way to determine whether tailings can safely be
dealt with by submarine disposal.
The process, already operating off the west coast of Canada, is to pipe the
tailings out and deposit them on the seabed 30ft down. Deprived of oxygen
and light, there is no chance the tailings can affect marine life, says
Rescan Environmental, SPCC's Canadian consultants. If studies, scheduled for
completion late this year, confirm this, the flumes for marine disposal will
be installed.
Most controversial are the emissions from the Ilo smelter chimneys. SPCC
officials have for years claimed that what the locals call smoke is water
vapour plus gas, with infinitesimal percentages of sulphur dioxide which,
the company claims, is an irritant rather than a toxin.
However, the Ilo smelter's smoke has been a local issue for years - and a
steady source of income for many local inhabitants. 'They plant alfalfa,
which is particularly susceptible, and there's certainly been some damage,'
says Ivey. 'We've been paying out several hundreds of thousands of dollars a
year in compensation and the sum was escalating all the time.'
If all goes to plan, however, that source of income will soon dry up. SPCC
is working on the installation of a capture acid plant, using technology
developed by Chile's copper corporation, Codelco. The idea is to close one
of the three smelter furnaces and eliminate one chimney-stack in an attempt
to push up sulphur dioxide content to a capturable 5 per cent.
SPCC estimates the capture acid plant will cost around Dollars 80m; the
project is currently at the basic engineering stage. 'It's high school
chemistry to understand it, but to control it is another, expensive,
matter,' says Ivey.
The slag problem is being resolved by building a sturdy sea wall to prevent
any further erosion of the original dumping place. The slag is unsightly but
inert, 'very similar to what comes out of a volcano', says Ivey. Locals
claim the fishing around the black slag beach is excellent. The sea wall is
costing the company more than Dollars 1m.
SPCC has spent an additional Dollars 1m on a sewage treatment plant for
their Ilo company housing complex where 8,500 workers and their families
live. As in most Peruvian coastal towns, much of Ilo's sewage goes straight
into the sea with little or no prior treatment. SPCC will recycle the water
recovered and put it to industrial use.
The Peruvian mining sector seems destined to take the lead in attacking
environmental problems caused by industry. Already, a new mining law
requires environmental impact studies for all new operations, and Daniel
Hokama, mines and energy minister, has publicly recognised the environmental
'debt' acquired by many state-owned companies now scheduled for
privatisation.
One important point that remains unresolved, according to Manuel Pulgar, a
Peruvian environmental lawyer, is the absence of legal standards for
pollution. 'If you haven't established permissible levels,' he says, 'then
you cannot talk about enforcement.' He would like Peru to follow Chile's
example and set maximum emission levels.
'If you're changing the environment - even if you're not harming it - you
have to address the problem,' says Ivey. It remains to be seen how swiftly
other Peruvian companies will take that message on board.

FT  04 AUG 93 / Business and the Environment: Recycling still a burning
issue - The arguments for and against incineration
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER KNIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Europe should burn more of its waste paper rather than recycle it. This view
is held by some parts of the pulp industry and those agencies charged with
handling domestic waste. It is rejected outright by environmental
campaigners.
But with the waste-paper market flooded by improved collection systems
throughout the EC, those who want to burn rather than recycle could soon win
a more sympathetic hearing from politicians.
Germany is committed to recycling 80 per cent of its domestic waste by 1995,
the UK's target is 50 per cent by the end of the century and the proposed EC
packaging directive stipulates a 60 per cent recycling rate.
The German success at collecting paper, combined with its inability to
absorb the recycled product, has led to waste paper being exported at below
cost to neighbouring states. This has all but destroyed domestic waste-paper
markets. Pressure is building on regulators to allow more waste paper to be
burned to provide heat and electricity.
The burning argument states that if properly managed, paper can be produced
in a sustainable way. The trees are grown, harvested and replanted, which
can be achieved with the minimum use of chemicals and disruption to the
countryside.
Paper can be made in plants that are self-sufficient in energy because waste
materials - such as wood off-cuts - are used as fuel. If the emissions from
pulp-making are controlled, then the entire process is sustainable.
Neither does this activity contribute to the level of carbon dioxide in the
atmosphere, because the plantations act as carbon sinks by fixing the carbon
dioxide. Recycling, on the other hand, is usually done near urban areas, the
source of waste paper. Fossil fuels are mostly used for energy and this
contributes to the increase in CO.
While recycling reduces the amount of paper that ends up in landfill, the
process also produces wastes such as inks, fillers and finishers. More
important, large-scale recycling cuts demand for virgin pulp. While this
might seem a positive result, a contraction of pulp markets in developed
countries discourages moves in the developing world to produce pulp from
sustainable forestry. This not only affects the economies of developing
countries but discourages the growth of managed forests in areas that have
been denuded by slash-and-burn agriculture.
'We are not against recycling. We say that recycling should be used in
particular situations so that there is the right balance. Incineration
should also be improved to reduce pollutants,' says Erling Lorentzen,
chairman of Aracruz Celulose, which produces pulp from managed plantations
in Brazil.
'Our forests are recycling carbon dioxide all the time. Planting trees is
the best form of recycling,' he says.
Lorentzen says that if Europe is genuinely in favour of sustainable
development it should encourage markets for virgin pulp from properly
managed sources.
Environmental campaigners disagree. 'The argument is a non-starter because
the idea of creating sustainable forests is a misnomer,' says Benedict
Southworth, recycling officer at Friends of the Earth. Governments should
instead encourage markets for recycled paper. It is also better, he says, to
use paper fibres as often as possible, rather than burning them after a
single use.
Campaigners are also against the incineration of waste because it produces
noxious emissions. But those in favour of burning say new technology and
higher standards have solved the historical problems of incinerating
municipal waste.
A study on paper recycling by the International Institute for Applied
Systems Analysis concludes that the incineration of waste paper might be a
good economic and environmental alternative to recycling.
However, this depends on the removal of some of the chemicals and heavy
metals used in paper and printed packaging.
Yvonne Iwaniuk, a representative of the Confederation of European Paper
Industries, says waste paper remains an important resource to the industry,
especially in countries with no domestic forestry.

FT  04 AUG 93 / Business and the Environment: Battery gets new charge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DELLA BRADSHAW
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It costs on average Pounds 1 an hour in batteries to play a game on a
hand-held computer with a colour screen, as many parents know to their cost.
When the batteries are dead they simply end up on the rubbish tip  - 12bn
batteries are disposed of worldwide every year.
A small UK mail order firm is now pitting its wits against the might of the
big battery companies with a machine that, its developers say, can recharge
general-purpose batteries and extend their life by up to 10 times.
Rechargeable batteries made from nickel cadmium are already widely
available, but in 1992 still only accounted for 2 per cent of consumer
battery sales in volume terms. Their big drawback is that they cannot be
used with the most power-hungry items such as games.
The Battery Manager is designed to recharge most of the disposable consumer
batteries on the market today - zinc chloride and alkaline.
The recharger has been designed by the development arm of Kleeneze Holdings,
which produces the Innovations catalogue found in many of the UK's Sunday
newspapers.
The technology used is not new but has previously been too expensive and not
researched fully, says Andy White, who developed the product. The
electro-plating process is similar to that for silver plating cutlery.
In short, when a zinc-chloride battery is used the zinc from the electrode
is dissolved in the electrolyte and dissipated. To recharge the battery the
zinc particles are plated back on to the electrode.
The big battery makers are dismissive about the potential success of the
product. 'Someone invents a recharger that will recharge primary (alkaline
or zinc) batteries every year. We never see anything come on to the market
that makes any impact at all,' said a spokeswoman for Ever Ready. 'Apart
from the fact that it may explode, you will get poor performance,' she
added.

FT  04 AUG 93 / Drink sales 'not being undermined'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
CUSTOMS and Excise officials said yesterday that government figures covering
alcoholic drinks and tobacco indicated that cross-Channel shopping was not
undermining traditional retailing.
Statistics on the release of alcoholic drinks and tobacco by Customs from
bonded warehouses showed no significant change in the first three months of
the European single market.
Customs admitted that the figures were less reliable than usual because of
lack of information about imports from the European Community since the
formation of the single market. 'We are continuing to monitor the
situation,' officials said.
Drinks retailers have protested that increased allowances for personal
imports of cheaper, duty-paid cigarettes, spirits and beer from continental
Europe since January were threatening their business.

FT  04 AUG 93 / MPs in call to rejoin Unesco
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RACHEL JOHNSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government should rejoin Unesco, the United Nations Educational,
Scientific and Cultural Organisation, a Commons committee said yesterday,
Rachel Johnson writes.
The government's claim that it could not afford Pounds 11m a year to
re-enter the organisation was 'unconvincing', the foreign affairs committee
said. It accused the government of making policy 'on the coat-tails of the
US', which left Unesco in 1985, a year before the UK.
The UK was a founder member of the organisation, set up in 1945 to promote
international collaboration and respect for justice and human rights through
education, science and culture.
The UK took observer status in 1986, in spite of a warning from the
committee. The government said it was concerned that too many personnel were
concentrated in Paris rather than in the field, that administration was
inefficient and that work was duplicated by other UN bodies 'with perhaps
less political bias'.
In 1990 the committee issued a further warning that Britain was failing to
participate in important initiatives and urged the government to rejoin. The
government refused, arguing that it was too soon to tell whether the
organisation was 'genuinely on the mend'.
The committee yesterday said that the government's objections had been
overcome. Mr Douglas Hogg, the Foreign Office minister, had said in evidence
that the few concerns left did 'not stand in the way of (the UK) joining'.
The government now says, according to the committee, that spending pressures
stand in the way of rejoining.

FT  04 AUG 93 / Belfast Europa closes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Belfast Europa, one of the world's most bombed hotels, closed yesterday
after being in receivership for more than two years, Jimmy Burns writes.
In its 22-year history the Europa (pictured as it is now and, inset, after
the last IRA bombing, in May this year) has suffered more than 30 terrorist
attacks.
Stoy Hayward, the receivers, said the hotel had been bought for about Pounds
7m by a local hotel chain, the Hastings Group. It was hoped that it would be
reopened in about six months' time.
However, its future remains in the balance. The receivers, the hotel chain
and the government are apparently still haggling over the amount of
bomb-damage compensation to be included in the sale price. Hotel staff are
awaiting information on redundancy terms.
The receivers have been running the hotel at a considerable loss since the
last bomb attack forced the closure of over half its rooms.
Several international hotel chains including Forte, Hilton International and
Holiday Inn had expressed an interest at an early stage but subsequently
lost interest.

FT  04 AUG 93 / AEEU merger talks with Ucatt stoke union rivalry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE EXECUTIVE council of the AEEU engineering and electrical union agreed
yesterday to seek merger talks with the ailing Ucatt construction union.
The move will intensify inter-union rivalry in the construction industry
because two other unions - the TGWU general union and the MSF white-collar
union - are also trying to interest Ucatt in an amalgamation.
Although the 200,000 member Ucatt has severe financial problems and a
dwindling membership in an industry where non-unionism is widespread and
unemployment acute, it is regarded by other unions as a strategic asset as
they fight a rearguard action for members and influence.
Mr Bill Jordan, AEEU president, said yesterday: 'A merger between our two
unions would create a formidable force in the construction industry.'
Ucatt's executive has agreed to meet the AEEU to discuss a possible merger
but in a statement yesterday it pointed out the difficulties of such a
development.
The AEEU contains a construction and building trades section which includes
some members that the construction union says were poached from it by the
EETPU electricians' union before its amalgamation with the AEU last year.
The Ucatt executive said yesterday that the 'continued existence of the
construction and building section remained a formidable obstacle to
productive discussions'.
The Ucatt leadership is embroiled in a serious row with the AEEU over the
issue.
Mr George Brumwell, Ucatt general secretary, said last night that the AEEU
continued to persist in its poaching activities in the building and civil
engineering industries. He added that this issue remained a 'barrier to the
AEEU electricians' section's reaffiliation to the TUC (Trades Union
Congress)'. The electricians were expelled from the TUC in 1989 for
breaching its rules on poaching of members, but delicate diplomacy is being
tried to smooth their peaceful return to the TUC at next month's congress.
Mr Brumwell warned yesterday that the TUC conciliators had not resolved the
problems of the reaffiliation of the AEEU's electricians' section in a way
which would be acceptable to other TUC unions.

FT  04 AUG 93 / Probing the business of failure: A study intended to boost
the official receivers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT yesterday said that Stoy Hayward Consulting, the accountants,
had been appointed to investigate the scope for involving the private sector
in the work of the official receivers.
Last month's decision to examine ways of contracting out the work of the
insolvency service, an executive arm of the Department of Trade and
Industry, raised concerns in some quarters that the interests of creditors
might be adversely affected.
The service has been under mounting pressure from a threefold rise in the
number of bankruptcies and compulsory liquidations since 1989. In the
1992-93 financial year company failures and individual bankruptcies totalled
42,700.
Yet the number of insolvency service staff has risen only from 1,400 in 1990
to 1,750 this year, straining its ability to perform its investigatory role
of preparing the ground for the prosecution of fraud and other offences, and
disqualifying directors.
Disqualifications rose from 499 in 1990-91 to 700 in 1991-92, while reports
prepared for prosecutions rose from 979 in 1990-91 to 1,155 in 1991-92. But
over the past 18 months the rate of activity has slackened. Indications are
that the number of prosecution reports and disqualifications fell by between
20 per cent and 30 per cent in the past financial year.
The Stoy Hayward review is designed to examine ways to reverse this trend by
offloading routine administrative and 'paper processing' tasks to the
private sector, where they might be carried out more efficiently. This would
follow last year's decision to 'market test' the service's central
accounting unit, which holds the assets of all insolvent companies and
individuals.
Some insolvency practitioners welcome the initiative. 'They've been swamped
with a load of duff companies,' says Mr Colin Raefide, head of the technical
department at Grant Thornton. 'If they get rid of some of the administrative
tasks, that will free them up to do what is important. For every case they
investigate there are 20 more that need following up.'
Others warn that if change is too radical it may damage creditors'
interests. Mr Tim Hayward, a KPMG Peat Marwick partner, says many
practitioners are 'cynical' about the government's motives and worried about
a rundown of funding. A decline in resources available to the official
receivers could affect the image of insolvency practitioners.
Mr Steve Hill, a partner with Coopers &amp; Lybrand and the head of the
Institute of Solvency Practitioners' technical committee, says small private
insolvency practitioners may be unable to act quickly enough to safeguard
assets after the declaration of an insolvency, the point at which there is
the greatest risk of 'assets going walkabout'.
He is sceptical about the capacity of private practitioners to compete with
the official receivers. 'They have 1,700 people they can mobilise,' he says.
'My instinctive view is that it doesn't lend itself to greater
private-sector involvement. The Civil Service is doing this at cost. We are
doing it for profit. I don't see how we can square the circle. I'd be
concerned on behalf of creditors if the quality of work was diluted because
it was being done by the lowest bidder.'

FT  04 AUG 93 / 110,000 more building jobs forecast to go
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A FURTHER 110,000 construction jobs could be lost before employment in the
industry picks up in 1995, the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors said
yesterday in a gloomy assessment of the industry's prospects.
Quantity surveyors' workload is continuing to fall in spite of signs earlier
this year that levels were beginning to stabilise, the institution's latest
statistics show.
During the past quarter the workload has fallen by 1.5 per cent compared
with 0.7 per cent in the previous quarter. Workload is down by 10 per cent
over the past 12 months.
Mr Christopher Vickers, the institution's construction spokesman, said:
'These figures are very disappointing. They show little improvement in
construction activity for at least the next six to nine months . . . It
appears earlier hopes that a recovery was under way were premature.'
The institute's forecast of a further 110,000 job losses comes on top of the
300,000-plus jobs already shed by the construction industry in the current
recession. Employment was about 1.35m at the end of last year.
Mr Vickers said that although more people were considering building, few
were committing themselves.
He said: 'A return in confidence is desperately needed if these projects are
to get past the initial feasibility stage.'
The institute's forecast is gloomier in tone than the one from the Council
of Building Material Producers on Monday. That predicted an upturn for the
industry in the second half of this year, but only if public-sector spending
was maintained.
Sir Alan Cockshaw, the chairman of the construction group AMEC, agreed with
the institution's figures, 'which do suggest there is little hope of any
apparent recovery this year or, indeed, before 1995'.
But he warned against 'interpreting these figures across the totality of UK
construction, as there are areas of the industry where prospects are far
more positive, such as process and civil engineering'.

FT  04 AUG 93 / Council accused of 'social cleansing'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR yesterday criticised the Audit Commission for the delay in publishing
its report on alleged abuses of housing policy by the
Conservative-controlled Westminster City Council.
Mr Jack Straw, Labour's local government spokesman, published a report which
alleged that Westminster had indulged in 'gerrymandering' and 'social
cleansing'.
He said it was being published now because of Labour's concern over the
length of time the investigation of Westminster by the district auditor has
taken. It started in 1989.
Mr Andrew Foster, the controller of the Audit Commission, had told Mr Straw
that the auditor's report would be published in July. It is not now due to
appear until October.
The auditor told Labour in a letter that his investigation had been delayed
by his discovery that council documents had been shredded.
Labour's report alleges that Westminster designated council houses for sale
in electorally marginal wards. The report says this was done because people
buying houses were more likely to vote Conservative than council tenants.
It also accuses Westminster of 'social cleansing' by placing homeless people
in developments outside the borough. The council says this policy was
adopted to avoid Westminster's high property prices.
The council asserts that it guarantees homes to residents established in the
borough.

suggested 'a continuation of existing trends'. They showed a small decline
in consumption of beer and spirits, but a more buoyant market for wine
compared with the same period last year. Tobacco figures varied considerably
with a surge in cigarette clearances in March reflecting pre-Budget
stocking.

FT  04 AUG 93 / When high-tech becomes high-risk: IoD case studies of
disastrous damage to company computersy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SECURITY SHOULD be a significant boardroom issue, and too many companies put
it low on their list of priorities, says the Institute of Directors.
The institute says in a booklet that businesses depend so heavily on
information technology systems that any failure can be disastrous, unless
provision is made in advance to deal with it.
Mr Peter Morgan, director-general of the institute, says several factors
have made companies more vulnerable and more aware of risks to their
security: 'The rise of crime - from major fraud to vandalism and petty theft
 -poses a continuous threat to the business community,' he says.
'The advance of technology and the vast expansion of its use has laid many
open to severe disruption and losses due to error, malfunction and malicious
intervention. The increasing use of highly combustible substances, not only
in manufacturing but in office decor, increases the risk of fire.'
The most common physical threat to IT systems is power failure, says Mr Tony
Elbra of the National Computing Centre. He says a survey in 1991 showed that
the average cost of a power failure was Pounds 9,000 and the highest cost
was Pounds 30,000.
'Hoverspeed, which relies on advance bookings for its ferry service, was
unable to accept any booking or inquiries for the duration of a power cut,'
he says. 'Sometimes power failures can drag on for days if the failure
causes damage to the equipment.'
The booklet, sponsored by Digital Equipment Company, says fire and flood,
although relatively rare, pose two of the more dramatic threats to IT
systems, which are readily damaged by smoke.
Two recent fires, at Digital Equipment and at Mercantile Credit, illustrated
how quickly the devastation could spread. Both buildings were rated in the
highest category of fire protection, yet a large proportion of each was
destroyed within a short time.
The booklet adds: 'Preventative measures, such as halon gas flooding, are
not always useful against a conflagration. More than half the fires
affecting computer installations start outside the computer room. They
affect the computer installation only when they burn through the wall and
allow the halon to escape.'
Mr Elbra says arson is the most common cause of fires that start in the
computer installations themselves.
Floods were often thought of as rare events, because cloudbursts and rivers
overflowing do not occur frequently. But last summer's flash floods in the
south of France caused serious damage at the computer installations of a
leading bank.
Many floods were caused by dripping taps or blocked drains. If these happen
over a holiday weekend, it could be five days before they are discovered.
The booklet says: 'Mainframe computers are often sited in basements and
their power cables placed under the floor. With the power supply being at
the lowest point of the building, it does not take much water leakage to
cause a failure. In one installation, a burst pipe caused a week's
interruption of processing; the long-term cost of this incident was
estimated at Pounds 1m.'
The 1991 National Computing Centre survey estimated that the total amount
lost in the UK each year due to IT security breaches was more than Pounds
1bn. The risk of 'hacking' - unwarranted access - was faced by every
organisation that allowed people to dial into its systems. The average cost
of each hacking incident reported was Pounds 23,000, with a maximum of
Pounds 50,000.
Computer viruses - rogue programmes - are described as facts of life which
companies have to learn to deal with. The average cost of a virus was
estimated to range from Pounds 12,000 to Pounds 50,000.
Mr Jim Bates, a computer consultant, says a little awareness can greatly
reduce risk. 'Educate yourself and your staff about the threat that they
pose,' he says. 'Equip yourself with at least two different but reliable
anti-virus packages and ensure that they are installed and used properly.'
Professor Peter Hammersley, at City University's department of business
computing in London, points out that confidential data is being carried in
portable computers, which can easily be mislaid or stolen. The loss of a
portable computer carrying personal data - such as details of individual
customers - could render the employer liable under the Data Protection Act.
The booklet also looks at risk management, protecting the office environment
and the vetting of potential employees or business partners.
Mr Morgan says: 'Preventative measures can save more than just those assets
that can be valued in monetary terms - not least in boosting morale among a
workforce that is aware of its employer's commitment to creating a secure
environment.'
EXAMPLES
'A security guard sought fame by starting a fire and then extinguishing it.
All the CO fire extinguishers in the area had previously been emptied by
night staff using them to create fizzy drinks. By the time the guard found a
charged extinguisher, the fire was out of control.'
'Most computer viruses are very badly written and cause system malfunction
almost as soon as they arrive. Contrary to popular opinion, their authors
are not whiz-kids or super-brains. In fact if any of them ever became
plumbers we would all probably drown within a week.'
'A fire and subsequent flood at a finance company destroyed every item of
information technology equipment, including mainframes, minicomputers and
personal computers. The immediate cost was Pounds 8m, but the long-term cost
was reckoned to be in excess of Pounds 24m.'

FT  04 AUG 93 / Bright outlook for work in Scotland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNEMPLOYMENT in Scotland should continue to be lower than for the UK as a
whole for the rest of this year and for 1994, although Scotland's rate of
economic growth is likely to fall behind that of the UK.
This is the view of the Scottish Economic Bulletin, a Scottish Office
publication, which bases its opinion on the consensus of independent
economic forecasters.
Scotland's unemployment rate has been below that of the UK since January
last year, a situation believed to be unprecedented since the 1920s. In June
this year Scottish seasonally adjusted unemployment was 9.6 per cent
compared with the UK rate of 10.4 per cent, and was lower than that of all
UK regions except East Anglia and the east Midlands.
The bulletin says that the relatively low rate of unemployment in Scotland
reflects the severity of the recession in the south of England compared with
the northern regions, including Scotland.
It says that all independent forecasters except Cambridge Econometrics
expect Scottish GDP growth to be equal to or below the UK's this year and in
1994.
They expect the south of England to recover from recession faster than
Scotland as the fall in house prices ends, while Scotland may also be
affected by a drop in North Sea oil investment.

FT  04 AUG 93 / Finance shake-up urged for businesses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A FUNDAMENTAL rethink of the way small, growing businesses are financed was
urged yesterday by Mr Howard Davies, director-general of the Confederation
of British Industry.
Speaking at the launch of a report by the CBI's Smaller Firms Council, he
urged the development of alternatives to the bank overdraft. In the UK
overdrafts account for 58 per cent of total business debt, compared with 35
per cent in Italy and just 14 per cent in Germany.
One of the report's recommendations is for the creation of a smaller
companies' investment network to replace the business expansion scheme which
ends in December. The network would consist of wealthy private individuals -
'business angels' - willing to provide equity backing for local businesses,
local investment funds and investment brokers.
The individuals could either invest directly or spread their risk by
investing through a smaller companies' investment fund. The investment
brokers would match business angels with suitable companies or draw on the
local investment fund to back eligible smaller companies.
Business angels should be eligible for tax relief on their investments of up
to Pounds 250,000 a year compared with the Pounds 40,000 relief currently
available under the BES, the CBI says.
The report also calls for more generous capital allowances on investment in
plant and machinery to cover 100 per cent of the first Pounds 200,000 spent.

FT  04 AUG 93 / Rise in M0 lifts hopes of recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHANIE FLANDERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SHARP rise in the amount of money in circulation last month provided
further evidence that the economic recovery is continuing.
Bank of England figures yesterday showed that M0, the narrow measure of the
money supply, grew a seasonally adjusted 1.5 per cent in July, the largest
monthly rise since September 1988. It had risen only 0.3 per cent in May.
Last month's figures lifted the year-on-year growth rate to 4.8 per cent, an
increase on June's figure of 4.4 per cent, and significantly above the
government's zero to 4 per cent monitoring range.
Other figures yesterday from the British Bankers Association confirmed that
lending by the main retail banks in the second quarter was Pounds 5.1bn
compared with Pounds 4.1bn in the first quarter. The association said part
of the increase over the first quarter represented the normal seasonal
element, but that compared with the same quarter a year ago lending was 19
per cent higher. The association believes there has been an upturn in bank
lending, albeit from a low level.
The rise in notes and coin in circulation, which comprises almost all of M0,
was somewhat smaller at 1.1 per cent month on month. But it was still the
fastest growth since March.
Some analysts said the rise in M0 meant retail sales would also turn out to
have strengthened last month, because the two figures are considered to
follow a similar pattern.
Mr Michael Saunders, UK economist at Salomon Brothers, said: 'The continued
gain in M0 contrasts with the more downbeat signs in the CBI's survey. It
suggests that retail sales remain on an up trend.'
Others warned against reading too much into the new data. Mr Ian
Shepherdson, economist at brokers Midland Global Markets, said: 'Monthly M0
figures can give a very distorted picture. July's sharp increase is a
one-off to make up for the fall which occurred in May. There is absolutely
no reason to think that the narrow money growth is accelerating.'
Strong M0 growth has been apparent since the start of the year. In the
latest six months, on a year-on-year basis, it grew by 5.7 per cent.
Official gold and foreign currency reserves rose by an underlying Dollars
395m last month, including proceeds of Dollars 213m from the third British
Telecommunications share sale. The overall level of reserves rose by Dollars
1.42bn, taking reserves at the end of the month to Dollars 43.3bn.
Proceeds from the quarterly tender of three-year Ecu Treasury notes amounted
to Dollars 636m while the existing amount outstanding under the UK
Ecu-denominated revolving credit facility fell by Dollars 4m as a result of
exchange rate changes, the Treasury said.

HOUSE PRICES rose by a seasonally adjusted 0.9 per cent in July after falls
in May and June, according to the Halifax building society's monthly index.
The figures contrast with those from the Nationwide on Monday, which said
prices rose by 0.7 per cent in July, and for the fifth month running.
The Halifax said that the annual rate of house price inflation in the UK was
now minus 3.3 per cent, compared with minus 4.5 per cent in June. The
overall trend remained flat.

FT  04 AUG 93 / Lloyd's deputy pressed to quit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR STEPHEN MERRETT, the Lloyd's underwriter, is under increasing pressure to
resign as deputy chairman of the insurance market following the publication
last week of a Lloyd's investigation into losses suffered by a Merrett group
syndicate.
Senior market figures at Lloyd's believe that Mr Merrett's decision to
criticise the findings of the loss review body is incompatible with his
position as deputy chairman - a suggestion he has denied.
One senior figure said Mr David Rowland, the chairman of Lloyd's, 'is going
to have to do something. It is inevitable that he is going to have to take a
view on this issue.'
He added: 'It is fine for Stephen as an underwriter to criticise the report.
But he can't do it and be deputy chairman. It is illogical for him to be
both. For in a sense he is criticising himself. This is a pretty widespread
feeling on the market.'
The loss review, one of about a dozen that have been commissioned by the
Lloyd's council in the past two years, examined losses of Pounds 19.6m
suffered by syndicate 421 on its 1983 year of account.
Names on syndicate 421 face cumulative losses of Pounds 57,000 for each
Pounds 10,000 traded. The review focuses on the underwriting of seven
run-off contracts, which generated most of the loss. Losses on the
contracts, which reinsured other syndicates and insurance companies,
initially arose from US asbestosis claims.
In a letter to the 341 Names - the individuals who supported Merrett
syndicate 421 in 1983 - Mr Merrett said the review had been expensive in
both money and time and had failed to address the issues put to it.
Mr Merrett said last night that he believed the loss review had been
conducted incorrectly. He said: 'It was quite proper for me to make these
criticisms in my capacity as a managing agent without interfering with my
responsibility as deputy chairman. I am entirely in support of loss reviews
so that Names get information on major losses.'
Mr Merrett is one of two deputy chairmen at the market. He was elected last
year and has played an important part in initiatives designed to control the
market's exposures to claims from risks such as asbestosis and environmental
pollution.
Earlier this year Mr Merrett announced he was stepping down as active
underwriter of syndicate 418 at the end of 1993.
Separately Merrett faces legal action from about 2,000 Names who are
claiming compensation for losses suffered by syndicate 418 in the 1985
underwriting year.

FT  04 AUG 93 / Pension concerns prompt SIB review
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SECURITIES and Investments Board, the City's chief watchdog, yesterday
issued a consultative document on the regulation of custodial companies,
which hold the share certificates of investors for safekeeping.
The SIB review was prompted by the theft of more than Pounds 440m from
pension funds controlled by the late Robert Maxwell, in which the role of
the custodians has been called into question.
The consultative document says 'the case for making the provision of custody
services an authorised activity (under the Financial Services Act) has not
yet been made'. Custody is the one area of the financial services industry
that has remained exempt from the act.
Because most custodians are subsidiaries either of regulated firms or of
banks supervised by the Bank of England, the existing structure could be
modified to improve supervision of the business without having to resort to
legislative change, the review suggests.
However, the SIB says there is a case for developing explicit and higher
standards.
Among the questions raised is whether custodians should be liable for losses
incurred by sub-custodians. The report also lays out the case for greater
supervision of nominee companies - shell companies set up by fund managers
to hold securities on behalf of customers. It notes that some fund managers
have apparently set up such companies to avoid regulation.
The SIB did not take a view on one of the most contentious issues in
custodial practice - whether securities should be held in the name of the
ultimate owner, such as a particular pension scheme, or in the name of the
fund manager's nominee company. Fund managers say the latter cuts
administrative costs.
However, Maxwell pensioners were able to retrieve Pounds 27m of shares
passed to National Westminster Bank as collateral for a personal loan to Mr
Maxwell. They argued that, as the shares were registered in the name of the
scheme, NatWest should have realised the shares did not belong to Mr Maxwell
personally.
Separately, a government advisory panel chaired by Professor Roy Goode is
examining pension fund law. Recommended reforms could include stricter
supervision of the custody business.

FT  04 AUG 93 / Fears for skill centres as buy-out prospects recede
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOST OF the 35 skillcentres owned by Astra, the failed training
organisation, are in the hands of the receivers and are set to close,
according to the National Union of Civil and Public Servants.
The possibility of a management buy-out for Astra appeared to be receding
last night. The organisation, privatised three years ago when the government
put Pounds 11m into the former Skills Training Agency, suffered from high
overheads and an increasingly competitive funding system.
The Training and Enterprise Councils, which are responsible for delivering
government training schemes in England and Wales, are Astra's biggest
clients. They say the demise of the organisation will make little difference
to either Youth Training or Training for Work, the main training scheme for
the adult unemployed.
Some Tec officials say the shake-out at Astra will be good for the industry.
The one reservation is that the experience of Astra staff in finding
placements for clients could be lost.
It is estimated that Astra, though the biggest training organisation in the
country, accounted for only about 2 per cent of all Tec contracts with
training providers.
'This is at most a minor irritation,' said Mr Andrew Gurr, chief executive
of North Mid Cheshire Tec, which has had a contract with the Astra
skillcentre at Runcorn. 'My in-tray is loaded with offers from other
training providers.'

FT  04 AUG 93 / Tories boost fundraising
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LEADING FIGURES in commerce and industry have been enlisted by the
Conservative party to revitalise its fundraising activities.
The party's new board of treasurers includes Mr David Sieff, a director of
retailer Marks and Spencer, Sir Philip Harris, chairman and chief executive
of carpet retailer Carpetright, Mr David Davies, chairman of Johnson
Matthey, the materials technology group, Sir Nigel Mobbs, chairman of
property company Slough Estates, and Mr Anthony Weldon, a director of
financial services group NP Record.
Mr Charles Hambro, the party's senior treasurer, remains chairman of the
board, which also includes two other members of the Tory hierarchy, Sir
Malcolm Chaplin and Mr Tim Smith, MP for Beaconsfield and vice-chairman of
the party.
In the wake of the controversy over the Pounds 400,000 contributed to the
party by Mr Asil Nadir, the former Polly Peck chief who jumped bail and fled
to northern Cyprus, the team of fundraisers will also have a role in vetting
donations.
Sir Norman Fowler, the party chairman, recently wrote to Mr Hambro to 'make
it quite clear' that fundraising must be 'independent of any suggestion of
political influence'.
He reaffirmed yesterday that cuts at Central Office and in the regions had
ensured that the party's spending was no longer in excess of income.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE POSTAL service in Cardiff was seriously disrupted last night after 900
workers went on indefinite strike over new working arrangements.
About 5,000 bags of mail were lying unsorted at Royal Mail's Penarth Road
headquarters as managers sealed about 2,500 post boxes in the city and
outlying districts.
The decision to extend an earlier 24-hour stoppage came after a meeting
called by the Union of Communication Workers. The union says a system of
fixed shift patterns would force many postal staff to work unsocial hours
permanently.
Mr Steve Bell, the union's Cardiff branch secretary, said: 'These new
working hours would have a disastrous effect on the social lives of many of
our members.'
Managers said the sides had been close to agreement before talks were broken
off and that more than 75 per cent of staff in south Wales and the
south-west were working the new system.

FT  04 AUG 93 / Anger over curriculum reform delay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR Ron Dearing's recommendation that the national curriculum in England and
Wales should remain un-changed for the next two years while changes are made
to testing came under attack from a leading academic yesterday.
Professor Sigmund Prais, of the National Institute for Economic and Social
Research, said the decision would mean a further 1.2m children would have to
take an 'unworkable' technology curriculum.
He said: 'Since the existing curriculum has been condemned as unworkable by
the National Curriculum Council and the secretary of state, I find this very
wrong and retrograde. Until the national curriculum, each school had the
right to choose whatever it wanted. Subjects like woodwork and metalwork
have now been withdrawn.'
A review of the content of the technology curriculum had been ordered and
was due to take effect by the education year 1994-95.
A similar review of the English curriculum, which had controversially called
for increased concentration on grammar and spoken standard English, will
also now be delayed.
Dr Hilary Nicolle, chief executive of the National Curriculum Council, said
Sir Ron had written to head teachers giving them an interpretation of the
current technology orders which gave them more flexibility. Although the
entire syllabus, which is very broad, must be covered by the end of each
year, schools would be allowed to specialise more than the curriculum
implied, she said.
Government hopes that the Dearing review would lead to a period of peace
with the teachers' unions, who this year boycotted curriculum tests, were
also dimmed by the Association of Teachers and Lecturers, which advised its
members not to co-operate with the Department for Education's new proposals
for teacher training.
These would allow non-graduates to qualify as teachers for children up to
the age of seven on the basis of a year's school-based training. This would
require extensive co-operation from teachers, who would need to work as
mentors to the trainees. The ATL is the first union to advise
non-co-operation with the scheme, which could come into effect in the
academic year 1994-95.

FT  04 AUG 93 / National Power backs gas stations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NATIONAL POWER, the UK's largest electricity generator, said it is more
likely to reduce emissions of harmful substances by switching from coal to
gas than by installing clean-up equipment at coal-fired power stations.
Mr John Baker, chief executive, said yesterday that the high cost of
equipment to remove sulphur from flue gases made it commercially logical to
build more gas-fired plant instead.
He was launching the company's first environmental report, which shows that
National Power is spending Pounds 1bn on power station clean-ups - most of
it at the giant Drax station in North Yorkshire where desulphurisation is
costing nearly Pounds 700m.
Mr Baker said there were no plans to install desulphurisation equipment at
other power stations. Instead, the company is investing a further Pounds 1bn
in power stations based on fuels such as natural gas.
Mr Baker said he was confident the company could meet the government-imposed
target of cutting sulphur dioxide emissions from last year's 1.3m tonnes to
660,000 tonnes by the year 2003.
Mr Baker said National Power revised and strengthened its environmental
policy in 1992. Yesterday's report was intended to be a full disclosure of
the company's environmental position, including details of all infringements
 -29 at power stations and 10 at construction sites.
Mr Baker said he would question the Pollution Inspectorate over its decision
to authorise PowerGen, the main rival generator in England and Wales, to
burn orimulsion, the controversial bituminous fuel, at two of its power
stations.
He was concerned that PowerGen was being given five years to install
clean-up equipment when National Power had received indications that it
would have to install such equipment before it could burn any orimulsion.
Environmentalists condemned the decision yesterday. Ms Fiona Weir of Friends
of the Earth said no orimulsion should be burnt without pollution controls.
The government was 'all over the place' on environmental policy.

FT  04 AUG 93 / Bus sell-offs in Scotland rapped
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE privatisation of 10 Scottish bus companies between August 1990 and
October 1991 netted Pounds 103.1m, the National Audit Office said, but this
was Pounds 15m less than the Scottish Office had been advised to expect when
the sell-offs were planned in 1988.
In a report published today the public expenditure watchdog says more could
have been done to maintain the companies' profitability before
privatisation. A deterioration in profits during the pre-sale period reduced
the companies' value to potential purchasers.
The NAO also criticises the Scottish Office for its failure to monitor the
sale costs, which totalled Pounds 2.3m. The Scottish Transport Group, which
owned the companies before privatisation, spent Pounds 1.2m on professional
fees, three times the Scottish Office's estimate.
The Monopolies and Mergers Commission is to investigate the acquisition by
Stagecoach Holdings of Lancaster City Transport. The Department of Trade and
Industry has referred the acquisition on the advice of Sir Bryan Carsberg,
director-general of the Office of Fair Trading, after concern over its
impact on the bus market in the Lancaster and Morecambe area.
Stagecoach has ordered bus bodies worth Pounds 13m, with an option for a
further Pounds 10m, from Walter Alexander of Falkirk, Stirlingshire.

Dr Mahathir Mohamad, Malaysia's prime minister, has unleashed a strong
attack on what he considers to be biased and ill-informed reporting on
events in Asia by the Western media, writes Kieran Cooke in Kuala Lumpur
'Their main idea is how to create friction and instability, so that if we
are unstable they can compete with us,' said Dr Mahathir.
Dr Mahathir, sharply critical of the West on a number of issues ranging from
the environment and human rights to matters of trade, questioned the motives
behind the recent purchase of a Hong Kong-based TV satellite network by Mr
Rupert Murdoch, the media entrepreneur.
Mr Murdoch recently paid Dollars 525m (Pounds 352m) for a 63.6 per cent
stake in Hutchvision, the Hong Kong-based parent company of Star TV. Star TV
is Asia's leading satellite TV network.

FT  04 AUG 93 / 'Civilian glove for Nigeria's military fist': The latest
twist in the country's muddled search for democracy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ADAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'PART farce, part tragedy, total confusion,' commented a retired Nigerian
diplomat after a weekend which saw a dramatic twist in his country's muddled
search for democracy.
It would not be possible to re-run the annulled presidential elections held
last June, President Ibrahim Babangida told Nigerians on Saturday. Instead,
an interim government would soon take charge. But he failed to answer the
question everyone was asking: when will the soldiers, in power since 1985,
return to barracks?
There is growing suspicion that the move is not simply a further delay in
the military handover to civilians, still officially set for August 27.
Instead, it could be designed to extend Gen Babangida's hold on office well
into the future.
Co-opted politicians drawn from two weak parties, lured by the massive
oil-financed patronage that Gen Babangida dispenses, could help him put 'a
civilian glove over the military fist', as one Nigerian described it.
Such a ploy could exacerbate rather than resolve the country's political and
economic crisis. Window-dressing will not improve the domestic standing of a
deeply unpopular regime. Nor will it satisfy western governments and
creditors, who have made clear that rescheduling the country's Dollars 34bn
(Pounds 22.8bn) external debt depends not only on economic reform, but on
the ending of military rule.
Some Nigerian analysts suggest that Gen Babangida is ready to go, but needs
a safe way out. 'A civilian government, yes, but one that he is certain will
be able to guarantee his security, and not investigate allegations of
corruption,' as one put it.
Others fear the general has become wedded to power. He has postponed the
transition to democracy three times before, but always giving a new date for
the termination of military rule. This time he gave no deadline. 'It
confirms what we have been saying for three years now, that Babangida is not
planning to go,' says Mr Olisa Agbakoba, president of Nigeria's Civil
Liberties Organisation.
'But what has changed is that the parties have collaborated in the extension
of military rule. This means that they are no longer the focus of civilian
opposition to this regime.'
In the deal reached at the weekend, the executives of the Social Democratic
party (SDP) and the National Republican Convention (NRC) agreed
unconditionally to form an unelected interim government - without knowing
its powers, duties, membership or term of office, or whether Gen Babangida
will remain president after August 27.
Resistance from other quarters has so far proved ineffectual. The Civil
Liberties Organisation proposes a mass stoppage which will 'paralyse the
economy'. But unemployment is high, the trade unions are weak and labour
leaders seem as susceptible as the politicians to being co-opted.
Meanwhile, Mr Moshood Abiola, the SDP's apparently successful presidential
candidate in the June poll, seems stymied, notwithstanding his considerable
support in the predominantly Yoruba and mainly Christian south.
Though Mr Abiola is retaining his claim to the presidency, his own party
executive is co-operating with Gen Babangida. Mr Abiola has denounced the
interim government, described his party's participation as a sell-out, and
told a crowd in Lagos on Saturday: 'I am prepared to face the firing squad
of President Ibrahim Babangida.' But with Mr Abiola deserted by the SDP
executive, Gen Babangida will not need to take such drastic action.
The party's split was emphasised yesterday when 24 of its 30 state chairmen
denounced the national chairman's call for an interim government.
The weak state of the parties is hardly surprising. They are both creations
of the government. Their credibility was already impaired because the
original presidential candidates in October 1992 (in an earlier, also
aborted, campaign) were banned from further political activity.
But these leaders are still among the power brokers, and significantly seem
to have opted to avoid confrontation - no doubt bearing in mind that there
seems little likelihood of an effective challenge to the president from
within the army.
Among these power brokers is the group of religious and community leaders
known as the northern elders which met last Thursday. They backed the
interim government, and their delegation to Abuja included the presidential
front-runners last year, Mr Shehu Yar'Adua and Mr Adamu Ciroma. Equally
significant is the stance of the other main non-party pressure group, led by
retired General Olusegun Obasanjo, who led Nigeria's military regime from
1976 until handing over to an elected civilian government in 1979.
Although the fiercest critic of Mr Babangida's presidency in recent months,
he has given guarded support to the proposal for an interim government. 'The
country cannot be allowed to drift indefinitely. We have to move forward
somehow,' he said on Sunday.
'It's not the best solution, or even the fourth-best solution, but when all
other sensible routes have been blocked by this president, I think we have
to take it.'
The sentiments go to the heart of the opposition's dilemma: confrontation is
either not feasible or it is potentially destabilising, but going along with
an interim government may be playing into Gen Babangida's hands.
If they are to placate the sceptics, Gen Obasanjo and his colleagues have to
show there is a middle way: that participation in an interim government will
curtail the president's time in office and not unwittingly extend it.

PRESIDENT FW de Klerk of South Africa said yesterday he was ready to send
more troops into black townships to stem violence in which nearly 100 people
have died in five days, Reuter reports from Johannesburg.
'The troops are there already, we can send in more, and if necessary we will
not hesitate to send in more,' Mr de Klerk said after attending a caucus of
his National party.
He said the government supported the idea of a multi-party peacekeeping
force proposed on Monday by the African National Congress but added that he
envisaged it as an auxiliary force charged with tasks such as crowd control.
It could not replace the existing security forces which would remain under
government control.
Democracy negotiators on Tuesday asked a special technical committee on
political violence to draft plans for such a force.

FT  04 AUG 93 / World Trade News: Tough US line urged on air pacts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton's advisory airlines commission is recommending a
tough response to governments which violate bilateral aviation treaties with
the US.
In its final report, approved on Monday, it urged multilateral negotiations
on a range of aviation issues and enforcement of bilateral pacts 'through
all means, including renunciation and suspension of privileges and services
when violations occur'.
The commission cited France's termination of its US bilateral agreement and
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's letter to President Clinton threatening termination
of the German accord as 'only two of the most prominent examples of the
problems the US government faces in trying to preserve and expand
competition internationally'.
Bilateral pacts can no longer protect US interests, the commission said.
'The increasingly contentious bilateral relationships already mentioned are
resulting in agreements or de facto relationships either markedly more rigid
and protectionist than before or seriously out of balance.'
The commission envisages a free flow of cross-border airline investment. The
US should approve foreign investment of up to 49 per cent voting equity in
US airlines, but only 'in the context of bilateral agreements which are
reciprocal and enhance the prospects of securing the ultimate goal of
pro-competitive, multinational agreements. The foreign investor must not be
government-owned, and the investment must advance US national interest.'
Another report out this week, from the Economic Strategy Institute, an
influential Washington think-tank, warns that overseas investment in the US
airline industry has enabled high-cost foreign producers to dominate
low-cost US companies. This erodes the US industry's competitive position
and destroys US jobs.
Gains by British Airways from its investment in US Air will shift Dollars
350m (Pounds 234m) a year in revenues to BA from US airlines and cost the US
economy 3,500 jobs, the report says.
Opening the US market to all foreign airlines could cost Dollars 4bn and
jeopardise 40,000 jobs.

FT  04 AUG 93 / World Trade News: Turkey's EC courtship lowers the trade
barriers - The most radical reforms since the early '80s
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF TRADE officials in Brussels still have doubts about Turkey's commitment
to open its markets, they might consider the case of Philip Morris, the US
cigarette manufacturer.
Having invested nearly Dollars 500m (Pounds 330m) on a plant near Izmir  -
its largest single investment outside the US - the company now says it would
have been cheaper to import its product from a European subsidiary.
Philip Morris's predicament is a measure of the impact of the sweeping
tariff cuts, introduced in January, that put Turkey back on track for a
customs union with the European Community by 1996.
Philip Morris, owner of the Marlboro brand, is something of a special case,
investing in one of the most regulated industrial sectors in Turkey. But as
the deadline approaches, Turkish trade officials expect a tug-of-war between
government and industry across a whole range of sectors.
In March a joint EC-Turkish steering committee was established, with the
government and particularly the foreign ministry enthusiastically extolling
the merits of a customs union. In Ankara recently, Turkish business leaders
from industries most vulnerable to import competition met to develop a
strategy.
With a customs union, the business environment will be turned on its head.
Foreign investors can no longer base their calculations simply on the
attractions of Turkey's large protected home market. Issues of cost
structure and export competitiveness have to be considered.
Moreover, for foreign multinationals already in the country, the tariff
changes will force a complete rethink of sourcing policies, with a clear
incentive to source imported raw materials and process inputs to the EC.
The trade picture has changed, too. Trading companies from Japan complain
their Turkish buyers are turning to EC suppliers and in some instances even
cancelling existing contracts.
For Turkish groups, the reforms will accelerate the trend to foreign
collaboration. Many local companies, from consumer durable manufacturers to
vehicle makers, are seeking foreign partners in an attempt to upgrade
technologies and boost exports - ultimately the only defence against
increased import competition.
Mr Hayrettin Yildirim, head of investment at the Treasury, says Turkish
groups will have to integrate with foreign multinationals if they want to
compete. He believes the days of family-owned holdings are numbered.
According to EC calculations, the cuts in import duties reduce effective
rates of protection for the Community's industrial goods by an average 6.4
per cent. For the first time, EC goods and those from countries of the
European Free Trade Association are provided with a clear trade preference
over third countries, estimated at around 4 per cent - the crux of Philip
Morris's complaint. The reforms provide greater transparency and scrap a
number of non-tariff barriers such as stamp duty and a range of special
levies.
The moves represent the most radical trade reform since the late President
Turgut Ozal embarked on Turkey's market-oriented policies in the early
1980s. The legislation, passed by parliament last summer, has taken two
years to prepare and covers some 18,000 individual import items.
However, for industrial goods, effective protection rates remain around 15
per cent while for farm products, which are currently excluded from the
negotiations, they are as high as 62 per cent.
Nonetheless, by 1996 rates are scheduled to be reduced to zero and Ankara
will adopt the Community's common external tariff (CET) for goods from third
countries. The EC lifted import restrictions on Turkish goods in 1973,
although textiles are covered separately by a quota arrangement and there
are various seasonal restrictions on certain food products.
But Turkey's task is not simply to satisfy the EC timetable agreed under its
1964 Association Agreement. It has to show that the arrangement is not in
breach of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
The new regime also has to maintain sufficient tax revenues at a time of
budget constraints. Ankara points out it will be the only country to enter a
customs union without gaining EC membership and is seeking EC funds to
compensate for an implied revenue loss of Dollars 3bn (Pounds 2bn) a year.
The adjustment for investors, both foreign and domestic, has been
considerable. With inflation around 60 per cent and the lira having suffered
a real depreciation, investors already complain their capital is being
eroded.
As trade barriers come down, the traditional attractions of investing in
Turkey change. Indeed, officials concede there may be a significant drop in
foreign capital inflows. Dr Ali Tigrel, former head of the state planning
organisation, warns that Turkey 'cannot go into customs union with closed
eyes', an increasingly common refrain in Turkish boardrooms.
In 1992, Turkey approved Dollars 1.8bn worth of foreign investment permits
(though considerably less is realised). Moreover, most - the Istanbul based
Capital Co-ordination Board estimates as much as 80 per cent - is targeted
at domestic sales in protected sectors such as cement, cars and tobacco.
In the long run the exercise will force through new efficiencies and
concentrate resources in the areas where Turkey has real competitive
advantage.
Mr Yavuz Canevi, a former head of the central bank and now chairman of the
Foreign Capital Co-ordination Board, says: 'I don't think Turkey should be
seen any longer as a haven for protected industries.'

MR WARREN CHRISTOPHER, US secretary of state, yesterday appeared to support
Israel's view that the US-arranged ceasefire which ended Israel's
bombardment of southern Lebanon last week could advance stalled bilateral
peace talks with Syria and Lebanon, writes Julian Ozanne in Jerusalem.
'The fighting in Lebanon. . . was a reminder of how urgent our task is and
how real are the enemies of peace,' he said after meeting Mr Yitzhak Rabin,
Israeli prime minister. 'But it is also an indication of the fact that
Israel, Lebanon and Syria are able to work together on a problem and I think
take a step in trying to ensure that the peace process isn't derailed.'
Jerusalem has expressed the hope recently that Mr Christopher would focus on
making progress in talks between Syria and Israel over the occupied Golan
Heights, seized by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war. However, analysts
believe progress with Syria will be difficult so long as talks between
Israel and the Palestinians remain deadlocked. There appeared little
progress in yesterday's meeting between Mr Christopher and the Palestinians.
Several members of the Palestinian delegation, including Mr Haidar
Abdel-Shafi, chief negotiator in the peace talks, boycotted the meeting with
Mr Christopher, accusing the US of bias towards Israel.
After the talks, Mrs Hanan Ashrawi, Palestinian spokeswoman, said there had
been no discussion of a US-drafted document which lays the ground for an
interim period of Palestinian self-rule in the occupied territories.
Instead, she said, the Palestinians pressed Mr Christopher to consider
reviewing the framework for the talks and to allow immediate discussion on
the final status of a Palestinian entity.

a 20-year period.
Primal will also venture into gold mining, build roads and bridges, and set
up a petrochemical plant, the company said. The deal was signed at the

Investment, Primal said.
Western diplomats said it would be Brunei's single largest investment in

Brunei, the tiny oil- and gas-rich sultanate on Borneo Island, has been

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN will seek a full reconciliation with its neighbours by making a clear
apology for aggression during the second world war and properly compensating
victims, Mr Tsutomu Hata, leader of the Japan Renewal party, promised
yesterday.
Mr Hata, likely to become deputy prime minister in Japan's new government,
said relations with other Asian countries were still coloured by the past.
The proposed coalition government believed there had to be an apology that
would 'act as an historical punctuation mark,' Mr Hata said.
His remarks were echoed by Ms Takako Doi, the former Social Democratic party
leader, who agreed yesterday to become speaker of the lower house of
parliament. The SDP and the Japan Renewal party are members of the
seven-party coalition likely to form a new government tomorrow, ending the
Liberal Democratic party's 38-year grip on power.
Ms Doi, who will be the first woman to hold the position, said she had
accepted the post in the hope of 'reactivating' Japanese politics and making
the political process more open and less corrupt. Many supporters wanted her
to reject the offer because the coalition includes former members of the
LDP, and suggested she form a new party of her own.
Japan's parliament is scheduled to vote tomorrow on a new prime minister,
and the coalition leader, Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, is expected to have the
numbers to defeat Mr Yohei Kono, the leader of the Liberal Democratic party,
which is likely to be pushed into opposition after nearly four decades in
office.
The coalition parties have made clear in policy statements that they
consider the LDP has shown too little remorse over the war, and that a new
administration would want a full reconciliation with Asian neighbours.
Mr Hata said the government had been unable to find the right words to
apologise sincerely for wartime brutality, and the time had come to send a
clear message about the past so that the country could take an appropriate
political role in the region.

THE US economy's lethargic growth is likely to continue in coming months,
according to the Commerce Department's index of leading indicators which
forecasts movements in economic activity over the next six to nine months,
writes Nancy Dunne in Washington.
The June index, released yesterday, increased by 0.1 per cent, after a
revised decline of 0.4 per cent in May. The index has been down or
relatively flat all year. Wall Street economists had forecast a 0.2 per cent
rise.
The index measures a basket of economic indicators, from unemployment
benefit claims to building permits.
Five of the 11 indicators - including the average work week - turned down in
June.
The index suggests that widespread laying off of workers is a continuing
drag on the economy.
Since President Bill Clinton's jobs package was defeated by Republicans in
the Senate, there has been no sign of a stimulus strong enough to lift the
economy out of low growth, although the administration has clung to hopes
that lower interest rates would do the job.
US executives and salaried employees have also been feeling the effects of
slow growth.
Median salary increase budgets for this year and next are below 5 per cent
for the first time since 1987, according to the Conference Board, the
business information group.
'As companies continue to wrestle with fierce global competition and a weak
and uneven economic recovery, the pressure to reduce and control costs
continues to mount,' said Ms Elizabeth Arreglado, a Conference Board salary
specialist. 'The modest salary increase budgets reflect this strategy.'

FT  04 AUG 93 / Clinton appeals for backing on budget: President says
planned deficit reduction of Dollars 496bn over five years is 'just the
beginning'
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton last night appealed for national backing for the
compromise budget deal hammered out by Congressional leaders.
In a television plea, he called on Americans to urge members of the House of
Representatives and Senate to support the deal in crucial votes this week.
Mr Clinton said the compromise deal preserved all the principles of his
original budget proposals, aimed at slashing the deficit through tax
increases and spending cuts and at providing incentives to economic growth.
'There are only two choices: our plan or no plan,' he said. The budget deal
would be the first step in an endeavour to revive the 'American dream' by
spurring the economy.
Mr Clinton's TV address was part of a campaign to clinch support for the
budget deal and put pressure on Democratic waverers in both the House and
the Senate.
Praising the deal earlier, Mr Clinton said that despite changes made by
Congress to his original proposals, he felt 'quite good' about the
compromise outcome. He promised that the Dollars 496bn (Pounds 332.8bn)
planned reduction in the budget deficit over the next five years was 'just
the beginning, not the end'.
The bill is expected to be passed by the House of Representatives without
too much difficulty, but the outcome of the Senate vote on Friday is finely
balanced. The casting vote of Vice-President Al Gore was needed in June and
since then Senator David Boren of Oklahoma has announced he can no longer
support the bill.
This means Mr Clinton has to persuade at least one of the six Democratic
senators who originally voted against to switch sides. With four of the six
thought unlikely to be swayed, efforts yesterday were being concentrated on
Senator Dennis DeConcini of Arizona and Senator Richard Bryan of Nevada.
Republicans in the House and Senate are all voting against.
Democratic leaders continued to insist yesterday that they were confident
the bill would pass. Failure to get congressional approval would be a severe
blow to the president.
The main components of the compromise package are:
Some Dollars 252.8bn would be cut in spending over the next five years and
an additional Dollars 243.2bn raised in revenue. The bulk of the spending
reductions would come from defence and by limiting the growth of Medicare,
the healthcare programme for the elderly.
The federal petrol tax would rise by 4.3 cents a gallon - the only item that
would bear directly on middle-income families.
The average annual cost per car has been estimated officially at Dollars
21.28.
The main weight of tax increases would fall substantially on families and
businesses earning more than Dollars 200,000 a year.
Personal income taxes would be raised from 31 per cent to 36 per cent for
those with taxable incomes in excess of Dollars 115,000 a year, and Dollars
140,000 for couples, retroactive to January 1.
The government says that the higher rates would apply mostly to those with
gross annual incomes in excess of Dollars 140,000 and for couple earning
more than Dollars 180,000. There would be a 10 per cent surtax on taxable
income over Dollars 250,000, giving a top rate of 39.6 per cent.
The top corporate income tax rate would go up by 1 per centage point to 35
per cent for taxable income over Dollars 10m. The taxable part of social
security benefits would go up from 50 per cent to 85 per cent for
individuals earning more than Dollars 34,000 and couples receiving above
Dollars 44,000.
There would also be reductions on the portion of meals and entertainment
spending that could be deducted as business expenses and the elimination of
business deductions for federal lobbying expenses.

FT  04 AUG 93 / Fyodorov says ministers exploiting banknote chaos
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEYLA BOULTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Boris Fyodorov, the Russian finance minister, warned yesterday that
conservative government ministers were seeking to exploit the chaos spawned
by the central bank's cancellation of old banknotes last month to reverse
radical reforms. Reformist ministers, meanwhile, were involved in
self-destructive 'intrigues'.
'The government was never really united. The old guard are exploiting the
situation and showing their old face,' he said.
He cited in particular Mr Oleg Lobov, the first deputy prime minister for
the economy, and Mr Alexander Zaveriukha, deputy prime minister in charge of
agriculture.
The few genuine reformists within the cabinet were 'not co-operating very
much. . . they are very trained in intrigues'. Mr Fyodorov said only he and
Mr Anatoly Chubais, the privatisation minister, were sticking together in
defence of policies such as tight spending and a free exchange rate.
Although he still wants an end to remaining central bank restrictions on the
use of pre-1993 banknotes, Mr Fyodorov admitted that the main casualty of
the central bank's crude monetary reform was 'the credibility of the
government, the president and the (market) reforms'.
Having intervened to eliminate the confiscatory nature of the central bank
operation, it was now difficult for President Boris Yeltsin, who had
initially 'not understood what he was being involved in,' to cancel it, Mr
Fyodorov said. But he expected Mr Yeltsin to stem the tide against reform
when he chairs a special government meeting soon.
Mr Yeltsin eased the timetable for the exchange of old rouble notes and
raised the amount of cash individuals could exchange from the original
central bank limits.
Mr Fyodorov, who was in the US when the central bank announced a move which
he would never have let through, finally intends to resign from his second,
much more lucrative job, as Russia's representative at the World Bank in
Washington.
He has been holding both jobs in parallel since joining the government in
December. But he excluded resigning as finance minister.
'This is not a time to give up or give in to any pressures,' he said, adding
on the contrary that his tactics now were 'to raise the heat, to make the
fight for reform more acute'. He said the worst thing that could happen is
that he would be 'ousted' in the fray.
Although the chairman of the parliament, Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, has called
for the punishment of officials 'guilty' of the banknote operation, Mr
Fyodorov said parliament was unlikely to dismiss Mr Viktor Gerashchenko, the
central bank governor, when it meets on Friday.
Mr Gerashchenko, who initiated the banknote operation, was yesterday quoted
as having admitted that he had not thought about the implications of
cancelling small denomination banknotes - which even prevented people from
paying for newspapers.
Mr Fyodorov said the central bank was not even carrying out its stated aim
of weaning other former Soviet republics off the rouble.

FT  04 AUG 93 / Russia wins debt rescheduling from London Club
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEYLA BOULTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RUSSIA HAS won a limited debt rescheduling from the London Club of
commercial banks, requiring it to pay just Dollars 500m by the end of 1993
and postponing by five years the repayment of another Dollars 3bn owed to
western banks this year, writes Leyla Boulton.
The agreement easing Russia's Dollars 24bn commercial bank debt, reached in
Frankfurt in talks with representatives of western banks last week, was
announced in Moscow yesterday. It coincides with renewed chaos over Russian
economic reforms, sparked by the central bank's botched monetary reform last
month.
Since debt talks started in December 1991 Russia has been postponing
repayment on commercial debt through a series of three-month deferrals. 'By
saying we agreed these deferrals made them and us look good, even though
they would not have paid us anyway,' one western banker said.
Mr Andrei Vavilov, deputy finance minister, said nothing had been decided
about rescheduling amounts which would come due next year. But if Russia
pays the Dollars 500m this will mark the resumption of commercial debt
servicing suspended when the Vnesheconombank, which used to service the
Soviet Union's foreign debt, defaulted on payment. However, western bankers
say Russia has been making payments to some banks all along - a practice the
rescheduling is supposed to replace with equal treatment for all creditors.
Mr Vavilov admitted there were disagreements on the implementation of
Russia's existing agreement with the Paris Club of government creditors. But
he said Russia would pay a total of Dollars 3bn in debt servicing this year.

FT  04 AUG 93 / Montedison to sequester assets: Temporary order made against
six former top executives
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MONTEDISON, Italy's huge chemicals group, which is deeply implicated in the
spiralling political corruption scandal, has obtained permission from a
Milan court to sequester up to L500bn (Pounds 209m) in assets from each of
six former top executives.
The temporary order, made in advance of a formal hearing on August 16, is
against former senior managers and members of the Ferruzzi family, which
controls Montedison through the Ferruzzi Finanziaria (Ferfin) holding
company.
Ferfin is now run by new managers who were imposed by bank creditors to the
heavily indebted group. The holding company said the court action had been
taken after the disclosure by Milan magistrates of 'various cases of
mismanagement which have emerged from recent audits authorised by the new
management and from the criminal investigations'.
The company said that the sequestration, which also involves indirectly held
assets such as bank accounts, was already under way. Ferfin warned that it
might take further action against other managers, or seek to raise the
amounts being sequestered.
The list of the former top executives includes the heirs of Mr Raul Gardini,
the entrepreneur who shot himself last month, Mr Carlo Sama and Mr Arturo
Ferruzzi. Mr Ferruzzi, Montedison's former chairman, is the son of
Ferruzzi's founder; one of the founder's daughters was married to Mr Gardini
and another is married to Mr Sama. Also on the list are Mr Giuseppe
Garofano, Mr Roberto Magnani and Mr Romano Venturi, three former Ferruzzi
executives.
Mr Garofano and Mr Sama have been key sources for the Milan magistrates
investigating alleged political corruption involving the former Enimont
chemicals joint venture between Montedison and the state-owned Eni energy
and chemicals group. Their testimony, widely leaked and believed to be
reliable, alleges that Ferruzzi and Montedison paid about L135bn in
kickbacks to politicans between Enimont's creation in 1989 and its collapse
a year later.
Mr Garofano, who returned to Italy from hiding last month to collaborate
with magistrates, has also alleged other financial irregularities at
Ferruzzi and Montedison while it was being run by Mr Gardini.
The allegations involve covering up Dollars 350m-Dollars 450m in commodity
trading losses incurred by Ferruzzi in 1989. These were kept off the group's
balance sheet on Mr Gardini's orders and instead parked with offshore
Montedison subsidiaries. The losses only came to light in June after
Montedison's new management examined the group's books closely.

FT  04 AUG 93 / VW's board shows cracks over GM row
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Ferdinand Piech, Volkswagen chairman, has suffered a setback in moves to
defuse the company's row with General Motors.
Following Mr Piech's attempts to initiate contacts with GM last week, Mr
Jack Smith, president of the US car group, informed Mr Piech in a letter
received yesterday that all future communication on the espionage affair
should be in writing and with Mr David Herman, chairman of Adam Opel, GM's
German subsidiary.
Meanwhile, the first cracks have appeared in the VW supervisory board's
hitherto solid backing for Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, former
purchasing chief at GM and now VW production director. Mr Klaus Volkert,
representing the group's workforce on the board which oversees and appoints
top management, said if charges against Mr Lopez seemed likely, he would
withdraw his support.
Mr Herman has told Mr Piech he must publicly withdraw insinuations that Opel
could have tampered with evidence in the industrial spying case which has
wrecked relations between the two car groups.
Withdrawal was a condition of further contacts, Mr Herman said on Monday
night.
Late last week, a day after he made a series of outspoken attacks on GM, Mr
Piech's public relations team revealed he had telephoned Mr Smith with the
aim of opening talks.
GM officials were caught unawares by the 'initiative' - they were unable to
contact Mr Smith, away on leave - and have now used it to try to force Mr
Piech into a corner.
The VW chief has been under intense pressure from the Bonn government and
colleagues in German industry to seek conciliation following his outspoken
statements last week, which were widely seen as damaging Germany's
reputation.
Mr Piech said last week he regarded the confrontation between the two groups
as a war, designed to damage VW and the German motor industry. He would win,
he said, and warned Fiat and Peugeot that they could be the next targets.
Opel had misused the public prosecutor's office, the media and public
opinion, he charged. He claimed the US group was leading a personal vendetta
against Mr Lopez.
Mr Lopez, just back from holiday, is expected to be questioned soon by
public prosecutors on suspicions of his involvement in industrial espionage.
An investigation by the US Justice Department has added a political
dimension to the affair.

FT  04 AUG 93 / Building equipment sales set to decline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SALES of construction equipment in Europe are forecast to fall by 15 per
cent this year, according to a grim assessment by the London-based Corporate
Intelligence Group.
It comes only four months after the group predicted sales would fall by only
8 per cent this year, and reflects sharp downward revisions in forecasts for
Italy, Spain and France.
Overall, the group predicts sales will fall from a slightly revised 96,656
units in 1992 to 82,708 this year.
Every country in Europe is forecast to register a decline, apart from the
UK, where sales are predicted to rise 21 per cent.
The Italian market is expected to fall by 35 per cent this year to 10,230
units because of what the group calls 'the political and economic impasse'.
Italy's corruption scandals have sharply reduced activity in the
construction industry.
Spain - where the market is set to fall 29 per cent to 2,195 units this year
 -is 'unable to solve its economic problems,' says the group. In France,
which is postponing spending on many big projects for the time being, the
market could fall 25 per cent to 7,980 units.
The group confirms its earlier forecast that Germany, which accounted for
nearly 50 per cent of European demand last year, is cooling off rapidly this
year. Sales are forecast to fall 12 per cent to 39,110 units.
The German rental sector, fuelled by the post-reunification construction
boom, is becoming rapidly saturated, says the group. Nearly all important
products, apart from crawler excavators and articulated dump trucks, will
suffer 'serious' declines in sales this year.
However, the overall trend for 1994 is brighter. Outside Germany, unit sales
will grow 7 per cent next year with improvements likely everywhere apart
from Italy.
Germany, though, will suffer a further 13 per cent decline, leaving overall
European sales down about 2 per cent from 1993.

FT  04 AUG 93 / Dutch armada fights to keep freight system afloat: Skippers'
'barge bourses' are being skirted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RONALD VAN DE KROL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE EASIEST way to spot a Dutch barge on the river Rhine is to look for the
tell-tale signs of family life on board.
Lace curtains hanging in front of the windows of the living quarters,
geraniums adorning the skipper's bridge and children playing in fenced-in
areas on the ship's deck are all clues to the barge's Dutch origins.
More so than their counterparts in Germany, the river barges of the
Netherlands are floating family businesses - as well as the ultimate in
mobile homes. Over 80 per cent of Dutch barges are manned by
husband-and-wife teams who live aboard and send their children to special
boarding schools for barge families during the week. Like farms, the barges
are handed down from generation to generation.
Now, however, some members of the Dutch fleet of skipper-owned barges fear
that their survival and their very way of life could be endangered, and they
have gone on strike in protest.
Their anger is aimed not only at looming liberalisation of Europe's inland
waterway transport but also at the increased tendency of customers on the
north-south route into Belgium and France to skirt the 'barge bourses' which
allocate cargoes among skippers in rotation and which ensure that freight
rates do not fall below a minimum floor.
'Eventually, there won't be an independent operator left on the rivers.
They'll be driven out by shipping companies,' says Mr Jan Ardon, a skipper
on the 'action committee' of strikers and protesters.
For the past five weeks, protesters among the Netherlands' 4,500-strong
skipper owners have blockaded locks, pelted their working colleagues with
eggs and stones and generally attempted to disrupt traffic in a country that
is criss-crossed by canals and rivers. On Wednesday, 60 protesters seized an
ocean-going Cypriot cargo ship in the port of Rotterdam for nearly four
hours to support their demand that the 'tourderole' system of cargo
allocation for destinations in Belgium and France be declared mandatory by
law.
The increasingly bitter protests started in June after a Belgian company,
Prayon, halted its previous practice of finding transport for its phosphate
cargoes through the bourse and signed a fixed contract with a single
shipping company instead. The change means that one customer's annual
freight traffic worth Fl 3.5m (Pounds 1.2m) has been lost to the traditional
tourderole system, raising fears that minimum freight rates will eventually
be undercut and then scrapped altogether.
Mr Barend Biesheuvel, a former prime minister appointed by the Dutch
government to mediate in the dispute, made a significant concession to the
protesters recently by offering to make cargo allocations between the
Netherlands and Belgium mandatory until the EC has worked out its plans for
inland waterways.
But strikers rejected the plan because they fear customers will quickly sign
up permanent shippers in the year it takes to get legislation through
parliament. 'What's the use of saving the tourderole system if there's no
business left to divide?' Mr Ardon asks.
They also want the government to act forcefully to persuade the rest of
Europe to get tourderole written into European law, despite EC opposition to
horizontal price-fixing.
The strikers say 1,500 barges support their actions by staying at their
berths and refusing to take cargoes. The stoppages and disruption are
directed at dry bulk cargoes such as animal feed and iron ore. Barge-borne
traffic of containers and liquid cargoes already fall outside the scope of
the 'skippers' bourses.'
The Inland Waterways Transport Information Office, whose aim is to promote
barge traffic, notes the dispute centres on only one route out of the
Netherlands. Traffic down the Rhine into Germany, the main barge artery in
Europe, is unaffected, as these cargoes are outside the tourderole system.
Within the Netherlands, only 18 per cent of cargoes are allocated through
the bourses, mainly grains, feeds, artificial fertilisers and some coal
shipments. Other cargoes, such as sand and gravel, are left to market
forces. However, skippers say the presence of tourderole provides a safety
net for all barge owners in all segments of the market.
Mr Ardon says skippers will continue protests for the rest of the summer if
necessary. 'Around this time of the year it's normal to be idle for three to
four weeks while waiting for the next cargo,' he notes. 'We can hold out
perhaps two or three weeks longer before the financial problems begin.'

FT  04 AUG 93 / Decision on air strikes papers over Nato split
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Nato council's declaration yesterday that it was prepared to use air
strikes to break the siege of Sarajevo, the Bosnian capital, was being
digested by diplomats who warned that divisions remained among the allies
and the United Nations about the nature and scale of such action.
'Everyone here is wanting consensus, and this morning's agreement is a step
forward. But it is not at all cut and dried yet,' admitted a diplomatic
official in Brussels.
The agreement, hammered out after a long meeting of the Nato council in
Brussels, proposes two separate scenarios under which allied air strikes
might be used in Bosnia.
The first proposal, which received the broad backing of the allies last
week, is to use Nato's air power to defend the ground troops stationed in
Bosnia.
The second and more radical US-led proposal would use air strikes to attack
Serbian artillery positions around Sarajevo, to break the siege of the city
and let humanitarian convoys through.
UN officials admitted that the logistics for the defensive air strikes were
unlikely to be in place for another couple of days.
'We are ready to act, but it is a question of the ground controls,' a Nato
spokesman said, adding that the air strikes were likely to involve the 60 or
so French, British, Dutch and US aircraft currently stationed at Italian air
bases.
Nato officials also stressed that air strikes against the Serbian positions
could not take place until the Nato council had held another meeting, widely
expected to take place at the beginning of next week.
Although most of the allies appear to have overcome their earlier fears that
air strikes could lead to retaliation against UN ground troops, some allied
delegations, including Canada, are known to remain nervous about full-scale
air strikes. Some French officials have indicated that they would prefer the
allied action to go even further to establish and guard safe havens in the
region.
Meanwhile, uncertainty emerged on whether air strikes would require a fresh
UN mandate.
Some Nato officials have insisted that attacks against Serb positions could
be carried out within the current mandate. But international mediators in
Geneva, piqued by earlier US proposals for unilateral air strikes, have
insisted that any fresh decision could only be authorised by the UN
secretary general.
With the Geneva negotiations on a partition of Bosnia appearing increasingly
fragile, defence experts yesterday warned that air strikes were unlikely to
provide a simple solution to the conflict.
Although most believe the allies could destroy the Serbian artillery that
rings Sarajevo, given the relatively unsophisticated nature of the Bosnian
Serb forces, they question whether they could do this before the Serbs
inflicted a politically embarrassing degree of damage on the city or sought
to retaliate against the UN troops elsewhere in Bosnia.
Mr James Gow, lecturer in defence studies at King's College, London, said:
'Taking out the Serbian gun positions is not straightforward but they can do

'The problem is, though, that that might not be enough. Their best hope is
that this would force the Serbs back to the negotiations.'

<TEXT>
JUDGE Ruth Bader Ginsburg was confirmed by the US Senate yesterday as the
country's second woman Supreme Court justice, Reuter report from Washington.
The 60-year-old federal appeals judge from Washington was nominated on June
14 by President Bill Clinton. She replaces Justice Byron White, who retired
at the end of June, on the nine-member court.
Judge Ginsburg should be sworn in within a few days so she can prepare for
the start of the court's next term on October 4.
Mr Joseph Biden, Senate judiciary committee chairman, called Judge Ginsburg
a consensus candidate who would be cautious and restrained in her decisions.
She joins Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, chosen by President Ronald Reagan and
confirmed in 1981, as the only two women among the court's 107 current and
former justices. She is expected to be a moderate on the court, helping
other justices reach a consensus.
The vote for confirmation was 96-3. The only senators voting against her
nomination were Republicans Jesse Helms of North Carolina, Don Nickles of
Oklahoma and Bob Smith of New Hampshire. Mr Helms opposed Judge Ginsburg
because of her support for abortion rights and increased rights for gays.

FT  04 AUG 93 / Spain calls for wage and dividend freeze
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BRUCE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Spanish government has asked unions and employers to accept a three-year
incomes policy that would freeze both wages and dividends to shareholders
next year and only permit small rises in 1995 and 1996.
The proposals are similar to an initiative rejected by the unions in 1991,
but have added urgency as Spain's economy sinks further into recession and
unemployment hovers at a record 22.3 per cent.
The move has been received with equanimity by employers and some hostility
by unions.
It represents probably the most explicit effort by government to manipulate
incomes since Spain became a democracy in the late-1970s. The government has
told employers it wants companies participating in the agreement to maintain
employment levels.
In late night talks in Madrid on Monday, the government also said it wanted
to prevent senior corporate managers being awarded 'armour-plated' contracts
which guaranteed large pay-offs if they were fired. Negotiators said they
would start removing these contracts in the public sector.
The management contracts and firing freeze are aimed at softening union
suspicions. Union leaders said yesterday they were unhappy with a wages
freeze and that they wanted concessions on social policy.
Under the proposals, all wages and dividends would be frozen next year and
would rise below inflation in 1995. Any increase in 1996 would depend on the
state of the economy. The CEOE, the main employers' federation, said
yesterday it had no fundamental objection to the proposals. Profits have
been hit by the deepening recession.
The public airing of the proposals - one of the main elements of Prime
Minister Felipe Gonzalez' efforts to manage the country's economic crisis
following his re-election in June - coincided yesterday with signs that the
Bank of Spain has begun to test the currency markets for deeper interest
rate cuts later in the year.
Following the weekend widening of ERM fluctuation bands, the Bank of Spain
yesterday cut its benchmark intervention rate half a point to 10.5 per cent.
The peseta strengthened sharply against the D-Mark despite the cut.

FT  04 AUG 93 / The ERM, Taking Stock: Economists bewildered by Bundesbank
rate cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER and JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT, PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE BUNDESBANK yesterday further cut the securities repurchase (repo) rate
as a prelude to mopping up excess liquidity generated by last week's
unprecedented currency turbulence.
As with several recent actions of the German central bank, economists
expressed some bewilderment at its decision to lower the repo rate to 6.80
per cent.
Last week, the Bundesbank caused chaos in the currency markets by failing to
follow up a cut in the repo rate from 7.15 to 6.95 per cent with a cut in
the discount rate. After its council meeting on Thursday it did announce a
cut in the Lombard rate by half a point to 7.75, a move which failed to
appease markets.
Mr Klaus Baader, European economist at UBS Global Research in London, said
the bank's move yesterday was 'a surprise'. He said he found it curious that
the bank had not seen fit to lower the discount rate last Thursday - as
expected in financial markets - but was now ready to cut a rate which it
regarded as more important.
Mr Helmut Schlesinger, Bundesbank president, said on Monday the repo rate
was more relevant to monetary policy than the discount rate because it
affected a monthly volume of funds three times as large at DM150bn (Pounds
58bn). Banks use repos for 14-day refinancing, though the Bundesbank also
requested bids on 28-day variable rate repos.
At Monday's news conference in Bonn, Mr Schlesinger said the repo rate had
come down by around three points since last September. The latest reduction,
affecting funds allocated at today's tender, puts the repo unusually close
to the discount rate level.
Some DM75bn of funds comes up for renewal today. But the Bundesbank is
expected to reduce its allocation of new funds sharply - perhaps by some
DM25bn - in order to drain liquidity after the inflows caused by support for
the French franc.
Money market rates fell yesterday as funds generated by the intervention
came on to the market. Call money was traded at around 6.5 per cent, down
from just below 7 per cent on Monday.
Mr Johann Wilhelm Gaddum, a Bundesbank director, said on Friday the bank
would not act to stop money market rates falling below the 6.75 per cent
discount rate if intervention in the European monetary system led to a flood
of liquidity.
The Bundesbank must neutralise this inflow to minimise the impact on money
supply and thus on inflation, both of which are still growing faster than it
likes. For this reason it has been reluctant to cut official interest rates
faster.
John Ridding in Paris adds: The signals from the French bond and money
markets suggest that investors are cautious about the prospect of rapid
interest rate cuts by the French government.
The markets have taken their lead from statements by Mr Edouard Balladur,
prime minister, and by Mr Edmond Alphandery, economy minister, that the
government would not rush into interest rate cuts and that the stability of
the franc remains a priority.
Economists in Paris said the first step towards a reduction in interest
rates would be the reintroduction of 5-10 day borrowing facilities,
suspended last week in an attempt to bolster the French financial
authorities' defence of the franc.
The 5-10 day rates were replaced by an overnight borrowing facility, the
rate of which was raised from 7.75 per cent to 10 per cent.
'I think we could see 5-10 day borrowing reintroduced by the beginning of
next week at a rate of 7.75 per cent' said Ms Marie-Owens Thomsen,
international economist at Midland Global Markets.
But most economists felt the government would not move to cut the official
intervention rate - which sets the floor for money market interest rates -
from its current level of 6.75 per cent until the franc shows signs that it
has stabilised following the widening of exchange rate fluctuation bands on
Monday.
The message from the bond markets reflected this view. Four-year government
bonds, for example, saw yields increase by about 14 basis points to about
5.62 per cent, reflecting a more cautious outlook on reduced borrowing
costs.
In the money markets, overnight borrowing rates remained relatively stable
at between 11 and 13 per cent, sharply down on last week's peak of almost 40
per cent at the height of the assault on the franc. One month and three
month rates were about 9 per cent and 7.5 per cent respectively.
The bond futures market, however, indicated expectations that French
interest rates will ultimately fall. The Paris Interbank Offer Rate futures
contracts show that the markets are anticipating three-month interest rates
of just over 6 per cent in September and 5.2 per cent in December.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Belgium has long prided itself on being a member of the 'hard-core' currency
club built around the D-Mark, writes Lionel Barber. But the explosion in the
ERM could be a mild plus for the Belgian economy which remains stuck in
recession. Sixty per cent of Belgian GDP comes from exports, and 75 per cent
of those exports are within the EC. If the new ERM flexibility spells lower
interest rates and a pick-up in EC growth, Belgium will benefit.
Luxembourg, which has a currency union with Belgium, would also benefit from
lower interest rates. But this prospect must be offset against the
disappointment of being excluded from the German-Dutch bilateral agreement
to maintain the D-Mark/guilder parity. Luxembourg's commitment to price
stability is the key to its appeal as a financial centre.
Belgium's big economic problem is the public debt, roughly equivalent to 125
per cent of national output. The deficit has been the subject of tense
negotiations within Beligum's fragile coalition government this past week.
The discussions produced a commitment to cut BFr33bn (Pounds 620m) from next
year's public spending plans. Officials acknowledge the talks are critical
to persuading financial markets that their faith in Belgium's franc fort
policy remains justified.
The need for new credibility has grown after the central bank abandoned,
reluctantly, its three-year-old policy of linking the Belgian franc to a
0.25 per cent margin of fluctuation with the D-Mark. Mr William De Vijlder,
of Generale de Banque, said the central bank appeared to have accepted that
the current fluctuation margin may, temporarily, have to be higher.
Yesterday, it was intervening around BFr21.40, he said.

<TEXT>
Prime Minister Edouard Balladur might be loath to admit it, but the demise
of his treasured franc fort policy may be exactly what the sluggish economy
needs, writes Alice Rawsthorn. For two years the economy has been burdened
by high real interest rates depressing consumer spending and industrial
investment. Until last autumn companies could count on export growth to
compensate for poor domestic demand, but exports have been hit by the
franc's strength since last September's currency crisis.
France has since slid into recession. Interest rates have fallen since the
conservatives took over in March, with the Bank of France's official
intervention rate tumbling from 9.1 per cent to 6.75. But these cuts were
not enough to improve domestic demand, or to curb unemployment which hit a
record 3.18m in June.
The decision to widen the ERM bands should enable the government to cut
rates more aggressively. The franc's relatively robust performance for the
past two days suggests it should be able to avoid a dramatic decline. Broker
James Capel expects the official intervention rate to fall to 4 per cent by
the year's end.
This should help to cut companies' financial costs. Exporters ought to gain
ground in relatively strong currency markets such as Germany, the US and UK.
But industry has so much surplus capacity that an increase in investment is
not expected before next year. Consumer demand could recover sooner, given
higher savings ratios, but confidence is unlikely to recover while
unemployment rises.

<TEXT>
Any easing of Irish monetary policy is considered unlikely, despite the
punt's much greater freedom of movement, writes Tim Coone.
The government's main concern is maintaining investor confidence in the punt
 -around 30 per cent of Irish gilts are held overseas - and preventing the
value of foreign borrowings rising any higher than the present level of
around IPounds 11bn (Pounds 10.4bn).
According to the finance ministry, the punt will be pegged to a
trade-weighted index of currencies, mainly sterling, the D-Mark and the US
dollar. A policy review is planned in six months. 'At all costs we will be
aiming to squeeze out inflation,' said a spokesman.
Restraining public sector borrowing and pay will continue to have high
priority. Irish interest rates are now at a 30 year low. 'If there is a
consensus in Europe that rates generally should fall further, then we will
follow that trend, but we will not be cutting rates otherwise,' he said. The
principal concern about easing interest rates further would be the danger of
triggering an outflow of funds.
Mr Chris Johns, chief economist at the Bank of Ireland, said: 'There has
been a very bad experience here from the late 1970s and early 1980s with the
go-for-growth approach, with the result that the monetary authorities are
now very cautious and conservative. There is no strong constituency here. .
. . that would argue in favour of a go-for-growth strategy now.'

In the words of Mr Gunter Rexrodt, German economics minister, the weekend
shakeout offers a 'breathing space'. That will allow Bonn and the Bundesbank
to concentrate on the country's most intractable problems: the inter-related
issues of the control of public spending and inflation, writes Christopher
Parkes.
On balance any further loss of competitiveness due to the D-Mark's
appreciating against currencies in its main customer countries - notably
France - is expected to be short-lived and relatively unimportant. What is
important is that manufacturing industry, largely re-equipped during the
late eighties and the unification boom, is well-armed to respond more
quickly than competitors to any upturn in demand. But unemployment will
probably continue to rise as industry counters recession and its built-in
structural problems.
The weekend decisions removed the need to support weak ERM currencies, one
source of distortion in German money supply. According to the central bank's
calculations, above-target growth in M3 is a sure indicator of a future
increase in inflation, expected to average 4 per cent this year and 3.5 in
1994.
The biggest danger to money supply is state borrowing to fill gaps in
government budgets caused mainly by the need for transfers to support the
eastern Lander.
The government is committed to federal spending cuts of DM25bn (Pounds
9.7bn) next year, and while the Bundesbank is reluctant to increase the
pressure publicly, it is clear that even more rigorous and longer-term
consolidation is necessary.
Bonn has a chance to concentrate on the main domestic task in hand,
unhampered by the monetary and political constraints of the EMS. The
Bundesbank, aware of the temptations to governmental largesse in the run-up
to next year's federal and state elections, will not hesitate to punish any
wavering by tightening monetary policy.

Portugal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER WISE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'We shall carry on as if nothing had happened,' was how Mr Miguel Beleza,
central bank governor, reacted, writes Peter Wise. He was making clear he
thought the government should maintain a stable currency, a tight monetary
policy and rein in budget spending to maintain the fight against inflation.
Mr Jorge Braga de Macedo, finance minister, agreed, with a laconic 'global
economic policy remains the same'.
Most economists believe the ERM changes will benefit Portugal in the short
term but could bring difficulties in the medium to long term. One leading
bank's chief economist saw greater scope to reduce high short-term interest
rates. This would stimulate greater corporate investment, helping the
economy out of recession more quickly. Escudo devaluation would also help
exports.
But economists fear inflation will again start to pick up from the fourth
quarter, when the target is an annual average of 6-7 per cent.
The lifting of the immediate threat of speculative attacks on the currency
has eased pressure to maintain the escudo's parity, and independent
economists expect the government to ease their tight rein on budget
spending, in spite of Mr Beleza's warning. The budget deficit is close to 6
per cent this year, against a 4 per cent target. Few believe the 3 per cent
objective for 1994 is attainable.
'There seems to be a yearning in industry for a return to Portugal's old
'crawling peg' system of devaluation,' said one foreign consultant. 'It
seems likely the government will use the 15 per cent scope it has to let the
escudo slide down at least to a certain level.' The parity most economists
see Portugal aiming to maintain is with the Spanish peseta.

Yesterday was a happy day for Spanish officials watching the peseta's
performance following the ERM shake-up and an early morning cut in the Bank
of Spain's benchmark intervention rate, from 11 per cent to 10.5, writes
Peter Bruce. It rose strongly against the D-Mark, igniting hopes that it
could withstand further cuts later in the year.
The authorities will be cautious in cutting rates and the ERM adjustment is
no guarantee of further falls, nor of improvements in unemployment or the
country's widening deficits. But by taking the heat off the peseta, the new
ERM rules enable economic managers to turn from the constant threat of
monetary turmoil and to begin putting policies in place to help pull the
country out of recession.
Deeper interest rate cuts will probably depend on government success in
negotiations with unions and employers on an emergency incomes policy and
the extent to which it is prepared to cut social spending. Wages growth has
become increasingly isolated as the prime cause of a stubborn 4.9 per cent
inflation rate. With unemployment at a record 22.2 per cent, analysts
believe only a combination of structural (a wages freeze) and fiscal (a
tough 1994 budget) measures can turn employment around. About 100,000 jobs
have been lost each month this year.
Similarly the country's overall public deficit, targeted at about Pta2,253bn
or 3.5 per cent of GDP this year, is out of control. Independent economists
suggest it could reach 8.8 per cent of GDP next year if tough budgetary
action is not taken now.
Cuts of Pta300bn this year and a further Pta500bn next year could draw the
deficit - which includes the central government and the free spending
autonomous regions - close to 6 per cent.

After sitting out the recent turmoil, Italy's politicians are assessing the
impact of wider margins for the economy, writes Haig Simonian.
The lira has floated since last September's devaluation and suspension from
the ERM. That has given exporters a competitive advantage; the lira is now
more than 22 per cent below its pre-devaluation level against the D-Mark.
The new ERM bands could cost Italy some competitiveness against countries
with weaker currencies, such as France. Exports have been one of the few
bright spots in an otherwise gloomy economy overshadowed by domestic
recession. Unemployment reached 13.6 per cent in the first quarter, up from
11.3 per cent a year earlier, and redundancies are accelerating, notably
among small-and-medium sized businesses.
Last month, the Bank of Italy cut the discount rate to 9 per cent, the
lowest level since 1976, but industrialists are pressing for further cuts.
The lower lira has had a negative side. Inflation, which fell to 4 per cent
earlier this year, is expected to reach 4.4 per cent in July. The domestic
recession has depressed price rises, but it was only a matter of time before
the weaker lira started to feed into prices, given Italy's dependence on
imported raw materials. In the longer term, the impact will be attenuated by
last month's deal between unions and employers on wage reform.
But the virtual collapse of the ERM will undermine one of the most powerful
arguments used to justify tough policies to bring down the budget deficit.
Ministers regularly referred to the 'external discipline' of economic and
monetary union to justify higher taxes and lower benefits.

The temptation for political leaders, as the timetable for monetary union
appears to recede, is to relax the effort for fiscal virtue and go back to
bad old ways, writes Kerin Hope.
As the only EC state never an ERM member, Greece has stayed on the
sidelines. Yesterday, central bank officials made clear that policy would
not change: the drachma will continue to depreciate slowly against the Ecu;
the target for the year is about 6 per cent.
To the government's relief the annual inflation rate of around 16 per cent
has enabled it to postpone the drachma's entry to the ERM, due to happen as
soon as inflation dropped to 10 per cent. With the new margins the drachma
could join, in theory, but a senior banker said yesterday: 'One major reason
for joining was that the disinflationary effect would increase confidence in
Greek monetary policy. But with a potential swing of 30 per cent, that's no
longer the case.'
A bigger worry will be keeping the medium-term stabilisation programme on
track. With an election due in 10 months at the latest, politicians are
demanding sharp increases in public spending. But a faster decline in
interest rates is all the government can realistically offer, assuming that
rates fall elsewhere.
Even then, there is limited scope, given the need to raise about Dr160bn
(Pounds 453m) every month to finance the public debt, now over 120 per cent
of GDP. Ms Miranda Xafa, economic adviser to the prime minister, said: 'We
simply can't afford to ease up on fiscal discipline, just because Maastricht
looks further away today.'

When Mr Erik Hoffmeyer, Danish central bank governor, explained on Monday
why the krone had been subject to speculative attacks - although
'fundamentally it is the soundest economy in Europe' - he referred to the
country's large foreign debt, accumulated in the 1970s and 1980s, writes
Hilary Barnes. Past policy failures explain why the government and the
central bank have strongly resisted a devaluation and why there has been
little pressure for one from exporters.
Denmark committed itself to a strong krone policy in 1982 after a period of
high inflation, frequent devaluations, a large central government budget
deficit and persistent large deficits on the current account of the balance
of payments under a succession of Social Democratic party governments.
Considerable political capital was invested in the strong krone policy,
which brought gradual dividends with lower inflation (under one per cent
over the past 12 months) and, from 1989, a surplus on the current account.
When the Social Democrats returned to power at the head of a coalition
government in January after more than 10 years in opposition it was vital
that they showed there would be no return to the pre-1982 policies. They saw
off a speculative attack on the krone in the spring and put up a stout
defence again last week. Since Sunday night interest rates have not been
lowered and a tight hold on liquidity has been maintained to punish
speculators who built up positions against the krone in July. Yesterday it
was charging 25 per cent for one-month lending to the commercial banks.

The continued link to the DM in the old 2.5 per cent band is seen as
vindicating 'strong guilder' policies of the past decade, writes Ronald van
de Krol. The Netherlands expects low inflation by maintaining the link,
although it will probably try to lower interest rates independently of the
Bundesbank. This may be small consolation, however, to Dutch companies which
could lose exports because of the effective devaluation of other EC
currencies. However, 30 per cent of Dutch exports go to Germany. Short term,
Dutch exporters will be at a disadvantage, raising the prospect of an
acceleration in unemployment.
Many companies must now choose between accepting a loss in market share or
trimming profit margins to retain business overseas, says the industry
federation.
Exporters to Germany will face heightened competition in that market from
companies in weaker currency countries. They will also encounter
difficulties in other EC markets, which together account for half of all
exports. Sectors bracing for the new challenge include livestock and meat,
traditionally dependent on Italy and Belgium.
One benefit, though not easily quantifiable, is continued investor
confidence in the guilder, a legacy of more than 10 years' commitment to
pegging the currency to the DM.

<TEXT>
The unwinding of the ERM is likely to give Britain the opportunity to cut
interest rates earlier and deeper than expected, writes Emma Tucker.
Although the base lending rate has dropped from 10 per cent to 6 per cent
since September when sterling was forced out of the mechanism, many
economists argue that the economy, on its way out of recession, would
benefit from further monetary easing.
The Treasury may choose to cut rates to cap the rise in sterling that is
expected to follow an easing of interest rates across Europe. This would
help keep the pound competitive, but might prompt nervousness at the
Treasury and Bank of England about inflation. At present, inflation risks
from low interest rates and a weak exchange rate are minimal. The headline
inflation rate of 1.2 per cent is the lowest for 30 years with upward
pressure on prices extremely weak after two years of recession.
The possibility of lower interest rates, combined with stronger exports in a
faster growing Europe, would boost the economy, but the effect would
probably not be felt before next year. So far economists have been reluctant
to upgrade their 1994 growth forecasts by more than  1/4 of a point.
Nonetheless, a more robust recovery, aided by growth in Europe, would help
the government reduce its budget deficit more quickly than anticipated. In
March, the Treasury forecast a public sector borrowing requirement of Pounds
50bn this financial year. This may be downgraded in the November forecasts.
A boost to UK manufacturing exports would also be good news for the jobless.
The official count of unemployment has fallen for five successive months,
but the total remains high at just under 3m.

FT  04 AUG 93 / Bundesbank cuts rate for short-term lending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BUNDESBANK helped to restore order to foreign exchange markets yesterday
by cutting the cost of short-term lending to commercial banks.
The action helped to correct the D-Mark's appreciation against other
European currencies after the relaxation of the exchange rate mechanism's
rules on Monday.
The German central bank's decision to cut its repo rate by 0.15 percentage
points to 6.80 per cent was the third surprise it has given financial
markets in less than a week, and was followed by a sharp appreciation in the
value of the French franc, which closed in London at FFr3.485 against the
D-Mark from a previous FFr3.505. In late New York trading it firmed
slightly.
The action also helped other currencies, including the Danish krone and the
Spanish peseta, to rise against the D-Mark after suffering sharp falls in
recent days.
The Bundesbank's decision, however, could not prevent several European
governments from continuing to express concern that their currencies might
suffer sharp depreciations in the wake of Monday's transformation of the ERM
and from taking protective measures in financial markets. Denmark continued
to defend the krone's value by keeping its money market interest rates at
extremely high levels.
At one stage yesterday, the interest rate for borrowing krone overnight was
250 per cent, with one-month interest rates at 25 per cent through the day.
These interest rates helped the krone to appreciate to a London close of
DKr3.975 against the D-Mark, having been as low as DKr4.0467 at one stage,
and was unchanged in New York.
The Belgian authorities intervened in currency markets for the second day
running, buying the Belgian franc as the currency came under a modest
speculative attack from dealers and fell to its lowest point in this crisis.
The Belgian government may be worried that the fracturing of its link with
the D-Mark will highlight basic economic problems, including a government
debt level estimated at 130 per cent of gross domestic product.
European governments may be unwilling to cut rates, risking currency
depreciation, until they have improved the level of central bank reserves,
badly depleted by the intervention to support their currencies last week.
The Bank of Spain, however, may have encouraged other central banks to ease
monetary policy by cutting interest rates and seeing the peseta move sharply
higher against the D-Mark. After the repo rate was cut from 11 per cent to
10 1/2 per cent, the peseta rallied to a London close of Pta81.48 to the
D-Mark, having been at Pta83.17 at the start of trading.
Strong speculation about a base rate cut in the UK continued to affect
sterling markets, with long-dated gilts rising on the day.
Some analysts said that yesterday's cut in the German repo rate may have
partly reflected the Bundesbank's need to take control of the money market
after the turmoil of recent days.
The cost of borrowing overnight funds from German banks has tumbled by about
1/2 a percentage point since last Friday.

FT  04 AUG 93 / City University raises Pounds 20m from technology arm
buy-out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LONDON'S City University yesterday sold a subsidiary company to its staff
for Pounds 27m, in an unprecedented deal for a British university.
The university, which has an annual turnover of about Pounds 50m, will
realise Pounds 20.25m from the deal, which will be spent on capital projects
and on a long-term endowment for academic initiatives. The remaining funds
raised will be split between the original inventors of the company's
products.
City Technology, the company which has been sold, makes environmental
monitoring equipment, and has benefited heavily from the passing of 'green'
legislation such as the Clean Air Act in the US. The company was started in
1977 to work on a project with the National Coal Board, but most of its
business now comes from the US and Germany.
In the year to June 1992 it made a profit of Pounds 3.8m, all of which
accrued to the university, on a turnover of Pounds 11m. It has won two
Queen's Awards for technology and two for export achievement.
Its main products are electro-chemical gas sensors, used to monitor toxic
emissions from factories, and as safety devices by workers in enclosed
spaces such as mines and sewers.
The company moved to Portsmouth in 1990, and now has a workforce of about
140.
3i, the venture capital group, led the equity syndicate which underwrote the
buy-out in conjunction with CINVen, Montagu Private Equity and Prudential.
The university, which was advised by Kleinwort Benson, accepted the
management offer ahead of several lower bids from the US.
The Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals said many universities had
established scientific and technical subsidiary companies to boost income,
but none had previously been sold.
It said further similar initiatives were possible although it was unlikely
that any other university would be able to raise money on such a scale.

FT  04 AUG 93 / Early British Coal sell-off planned: DTI wants company split
before sale to private sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INDUSTRY ministers want to privatise the bulk of British Coal by as early as
next July. The sale is likely to break it up into at least two separate
companies.
Ministers also prefer 'trade sales' to other existing companies to a
flotation on the stock exchange, largely because this would be more likely
to lead to the replacement of existing management with private-sector
managers. There are also strong doubts about the public's willingness to buy
shares in such a controversial privatisation.
The industry had expected British Coal to stay in the public sector at least
until early 1995.
Although ministers have yet to decide finally on a break-up, they are
strongly influenced by the privatisations of the gas and electricity
generating industries, where the creation of a monopoly and duopoly
respectively caused considerable controversy.
British Coal will counter that splitting up the industry would weaken its
bargaining power with the electricity generators which are its main
customers.
The Department of Trade and Industry's preferred timetable would entail a
bill being presented to the House of Commons shortly after it re-assembles
in October and a second reading before Christmas. That would open up the
possibility that the bill could be given royal assent and the main parts of
British Coal sold next July.
The timetable has yet to be accepted by the cabinet. But one argument in
favour is that it places as much time as possible between the controversial
sale and the next general election.
Even if the fast-track timetable is approved, large parts of British Coal
would remain in the public sector for months or even years. Ministers have
accepted the need for a residual body, possibly retaining the British Coal
title. This would run some pits while it was determined whether there was a
market for their output.
There may be several pits in that category. Most industry analysts expect
the decline in the market to leave only about 15 of the 30 remaining pits
with a long-term future. But the government could have difficulty closing
the other 15 by the middle of next year, given the public outcry its last
closure plans created.
The residual body would also be in charge of most of the corporation's
Pounds 3bn of liabilities, including those for subsidence and concessionary
coal for former employees.
Ministers' preference for splitting British Coal could allow them to satisfy
the demands of Mining Scotland, an influential lobby group which wants all
interests of the corporation north of the border to be hived off into a
separate company, and has set up a company to buy them.
The bulk of the corporation in England and Wales could easily be divided
into two organisations, one based in the Midlands and the other in
Yorkshire, which the corporation is bringing into being through a
restructuring already under way.
It is possible, however, that the two organisations could be split further.
Isolated mines such as Ellington in Northumberland and Tower in Wales may be
sold off separately, although their future seems less secure than the pits
in the Midlands and Yorkshire.
Mr Robin Cook, the shadow trade and industry secretary, said last night that
Labour would fight any plans to privatise the coal industry.

FT  04 AUG 93 / Franco-German ERM rift denied by finance ministers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR THEO WAIGEL, the German finance minister, and Mr Edmond Alphandery, his
French counterpart, joined forces yesterday to quell talk of a Franco-German
rift over the crisis in the exchange rate mechanism.
The two ministers were meeting in Paris with their central bank chiefs for a
session of the Franco-German economic council.
They stressed that they regarded Monday's decision by European Community
finance ministers to widen the trading bands for ERM currencies as a
temporary measure.
Mr Alphandery, whose government's franc fort policy of maintaining a strong
link between the franc and the German D-Mark is under severe strain, said
the Brussels agreement was 'an imaginative, but temporary' solution which
would be reviewed by another meeting of the Franco-German economic council
in the autumn.
Mr Waigel also stressed the 'temporary' nature of the decision and predicted
that ERM bands were likely to narrow again before the end of the year.
Both ministers were at pains to claim that relations between France and
Germany, far from weakening, had been strengthened by the crisis. Mr Waigel,
who last month abruptly cancelled a meeting with Mr Alphandery following
controversy in Germany over remarks by the French minister concerning the
franc's performance, said the EC could not have reached the 'excellent
solution' without France's co-operation.
'I want to lay to rest all these rumours about the so-called deterioration
in Franco-German relations . . . I can testify that during this period of
tension on the markets, the Franco-German couple once again proved its
solidity,' said Mr Alphandery.
Their comments followed Monday's admission by Mr Edouard Balladur, the
French primeminister, that the Brussels negotiations had been strained. It
has been widely asserted in recent days by EC officials and by political
observers in both countries that the Franco-German alliance is under intense
pressure. According to one authoritative report in Paris, the Brussels talks
were twice imperilled by disagreements between the two countries.
Mr Alphandery, who had appeared apprehensive on Monday at Mr Balladur's
press conference, seemed more confident yesterday.
Mr Alphandery and Mr Waigel faced the battery of television cameras with
resolute smiles.
Mr Alphandery said there was evidence that France was emerging from
recession.
He said that the economy had stabilised in the second quarter after two
successive quarters of decline. 'The worst is already behind us in France,
as it is in Germany,' he said.
Meanwhile Mr Helmut Schlesinger, Bundesbank president, tried to assuage
concern about the impact of the D-Mark's rise on the German economy by
stressing that fluctuations in the ERM currencies, including the D-Mark, had
been relatively slight since the Brussels decision.

FT  03 AUG 93 / International Bonds: Rome prepares global bond that could
raise up to Dollars 5bn
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE Republic of Italy is preparing to issue the world's largest global bond
in a deal which could raise up to Dollars 5bn and virtually complete this
year's foreign borrowing programme.
The largest global dollar bonds issued so far are Dollars 3bn issues for the
UK and Ontario, according to IFR Securities Data, while the UK and Italy
have both issued global offerings of DM5bn.
Italy has filed a registration with the US Securities and Exchange
Commission to issue up to Dollars 10bn in bonds on the US market over the
next decade. The registration is expected to be used up over a number of
issues over a period of several years.
Precise timing for the transaction has not been revealed. However, the
Italian treasury will be embarking on a two-week roadshow to international
investors in early September. 'The bond could come straight after,' said Mr
Alberto Giovannini, an adviser to the treasury.
The size of the issue will depend partly on the outlook for issuing in other
currencies before year end, said Mr Giovannini.
In January, the Italian authorities said they wanted to raise Dollars 10bn
to Dollars 15bn on international markets this year. So far, they have
borrowed about Dollars 7.2bn through fixed rate deals in D-Marks, dollars
and yen as well as a floating rate dollar bond.
However, Italy's foreign currency debt represents only 3 per cent of the
total outstanding debt, since the large Italian domestic market dwarfs
Italy's foreign bond borrowings. 'The government will not push the market
for an extra Dollars 1bn, because it's just a drop in the ocean for Italy,'
a dealer said.
The global bond, which has been expected in international markets, will be
led by Goldman Sachs and Salomon Brothers.
Choosing a global deal, rather than a more traditional Eurobond offering,
will allow the treasury to access the US debt market immediately, said Mr
Giovannini.
Italy has not previously tapped the US market.
'This is probably the most important issue in the global bond market. Before
it was just speculation. Now it's a fact,' he said
Elsewhere, activity in the Eurobond market was subdued yesterday, as
investors took stock of the effective collapse of the exchange rate
mechanism over the weekend. Even without the recent turmoil in the currency
markets, new issue volume would be subdued, as August is the low point for
activity in the Eurobond market.
In the D-mark sector, the National Bank of Hungary, which borrows on behalf
of the Hungarian government, launched a DM1bn issue of 10-year bonds via
Deutsche Bank.
The deal was initially sold at a spread of 230 basis points over the 10-year
Treuhand bond yield.
The Treuhand issue is considered the 10-year benchmark, prior to the launch
of the new 10-year bund today.
Other potential deals are a D-mark offering by the European Investment Bank
and a Dollars 500m 10-year Eurobond by the Inter American Development Bank.
The People's Republic of China is planning its first Eurobond issue since
the Tiananmen Square massacre in 1989. Nomura has been awarded the mandate
to arrange the Euroyen bond issue, following a series of roadshows to
promote the offering in Europe and Asia Pacific in September.

FT  03 AUG 93 / International Company News: Abbey National rises 11% pre-tax
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ABBEY National, the home loans and banking group, yesterday reported an 11
per cent rise in interim pre-tax profits to Pounds 301m (Dollars 448.5m)
from Pounds 270m. It was helped by rapid growth in wholesale-funded
fixed-rate mortgages.
Abbey achieved a 31 per cent rise in UK retail profits, to Pounds 300m from
Pounds 229m, helped by a lower bad debt charge of Pounds 118m against Pounds
146m. This reflected a fall in house repossessions and in the number of
mortgages in arrears.
In France, the bad debt charge rose to Pounds 94m, from Pounds 16m last
time, because of the weak commercial property market. France accounted for
the bulk of an Pounds 86m loss in continental Europe and offshore, against a
Pounds 9m loss in the first half of 1992.
The European problems drove up the overall bad debt charge, which includes
loan provisions and suspended interest, by 35 per cent to Pounds 222m.
Abbey raised its share of new mortgage lending to 23.3 per cent of the UK
mortgage market, against 12.4 per cent, by promotion of fixed-rate
mortgages. Net lending was Pounds 2bn, compared with Pounds 1.2bn, largely
funded by wholesale funds rather than retail savings.
The group's share of UK retail savings fell fro 4.1 to 3.3 per cent as
retail inflows dropped to Pounds 400m from Pounds 700m, and the percentage
of the domestic mortgage book funded by retail savings fell to 80 per cent
from 86 per cent.
Operating profits before bad debts rose 20 per cent to Pounds 523m. Sir
Christopher Tugendhat, chairman, said the result was 'encouraging, given
that the UK housing market is only just beginning to emerge from a prolonged
recession'.
Sir Christopher said Abbey believed trading results in France might be
improved by interest rate cuts.

FT  03 AUG 93 / Flour mill to be built in Sumatra
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM KEELING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JAKARTA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A Dollars 100M FLOUR MILL is to be built at Belawan in North Sumatra, taking
advantage of the Indonesian government's decision last June partly to
deregulate the flour sector.
Indonesia is one of the world's largest importers of wheat, having bought
more than 2m tonnes last year.
The country is also home to what is reputed to the world's largest
wheat-miller, Bogasari Flour Mills, a subsidiary of Salim Group, which has a
monopoly in the country's flour sector.
The group is a major consumer of flour, with its subsidiary Indofood Group
enjoying a 90 per cent share of Indonesia's instant noodle market.
The new mill, with capacity of 1,000 tonnes a day, will be a joint venture
of Bogasari, the Rodamas Group and ABC Group, both of Indonesia, and Gold
Coin of Malaysia.
With plants at Ujungpandang on Sulawesi, and in Jakarta and Surubaya on
Java, Bogasari has a capacity of about 11,000 tonnes a day.
In June, the government opened the sector to foreign investment but requires
that all new ventures, domestic or foreign, export at least 65 per cent of
production.
Indonesia, however, produces no wheat and the export requirement effectively
closes most avenues for new investment.
Industry officials say the participation of Bogasari in the new plant's
consortium reflects the limitations of the deregulation package and the
continuing stranglehold of Salim Group over the sector.
The consortium is likely to argue that the plant be considered an expansion
of the existing Bogasari operations and thus escape the export requirement.

FT  03 AUG 93 / Tutu seeks foreign force to restore peace in S Africa
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ARCHBISHOP Desmond Tutu yesterday called for foreign peacekeepers in South
Africa as the body count from one of the bloodiest weekends in the
transition from apartheid to democracy neared 100, Reuter reports from
Johannesburg.
A police spokeswoman said 89 people were killed between Friday night and
yesterday morning in factional fighting which raged through the Johannesburg
townships of Tembisa, Tokoza, Katlehong and Vosloorus.
Police in Natal province said six people were killed over the weekend,
bringing to almost 600 the death toll in the month since democracy
negotiators named April 27 as the date for the first non-racial election.
Archbishop Tutu, a Nobel Peace Prize winner, said the slaughter
'demonstrated beyond doubt' that South Africans were incapable of restoring
law and order themselves.
'We need to appeal to the international community to send in, as a matter of
urgency, a corps of police officers experienced in handling civil turmoil,'
he added.
Negotiators at democracy talks outside Johannesburg expressed horror at the
slaughter, which threatens to wreck progress to democracy.
Mr Nelson Mandela's African National Congress urged the conference to agree
to form a joint peacekeeping force, representing black and white South
African political groups.
'We should have a joint peacekeeping force, to be installed within a matter
of weeks,' said Mr Cyril Ramaphosa, ANC chief negotiator.
He said the ANC wanted to discuss Archbishop Tutu's plan with him. The more
radical Pan Africanist Congress said it had been advocating international
involvement for a long time.
Black parties distrust the white-led South African police, despite its
claims of impartiality in township wars that have claimed more than 9,000
lives in three years.
Rail authorities announced yesterday they were temporarily suspending trains
serving the volatile townships east of Johannesburg, to protect commuters
and property.
Political leaders expressed frustration and helplessness over the second
most bloody month of fighting since President F W de Klerk lifted apartheid
clamps in early 1990.

FT  03 AUG 93 / London Stock Exchange: Footsie challenges its closing peak
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INVESTORS in the UK stock market continued yesterday to take a highly
optimistic view of the implications for European and British interest rates
from the dramatic developments in the ERM network. At the day's peak the
FT-SE 100 Index was within a few points of its previous closing high, and
overseas buyers were identified in both equities and stock index futures.
The first day of the new equity trading account opened on a confident note.
There was slight disappointment, however, that the ERM was not 'finally laid
to rest' at the weekend, as one dealer put it. Share gains were almost
halved in the second half of the session when a big buyer withdrew from the
futures market and Wall Street made a slow start, showing a fall of 12
points on the Dow Average in UK trading hours. Equities also took note of a
less aggressive performance in UK government bonds.
The final reading left the FT-SE 100 at 2,941.7 for a net gain of 15.2
points. At midsession the Footsie touched 2,954.5, within 3 points of the
closing high reached on March 8, although still some way short of a trading
peak of 2,980.9, also in March.
Although several securities houses upgraded forecasts for the UK market, it
was clear at yesterday's morning strategy meetings that many houses were
still wrestling with the implications of the new global investment scenario
posed by the ERM currency developments.
The broad view was that interest rate cuts in Europe will open the way for a
reduction in UK base rates and also, by rejuvenating other continental
European economies, give a boost to Britain's own economic recovery.
Consequently, there were buyers both for stocks with interests or markets in
France or elsewhere in Europe, but also for domestic retail or consumer
stocks which would benefit quickly from a further lowering of UK base rates.
While a cut in base rates has long been foreshadowed in the stock market,
the latest ERM developments strengthen the chances that the move will come
soon. 'The best news of all is that lower UK interest rates can be sustained
. . . we forecast base rates still at 4 per cent at the end of 1994,' said
Mr Roger Bootle at Midland Bank.
At Strauss Turnbull, Mr Ian Harnett sees base rates at 5 per cent until the
year-end. Strauss yesterday raised its year-end Footsie forecast to 3,250;
Mr Harnett believes that dollar stocks will join in the upswing as lower
interest rates in Europe help the US currency.
Mr Nick Knight, the Nomura analyst regarded as the most bullish of UK equity
strategists, has reaffirmed his 3,500 year-end forecast, stressing that 'the
market to buy is the UK'. He suspects that interest rate cuts may have been
well discounted in the French market.
There was some disappointment in London, however, that equity trading volume
was restrained - the Seaq total of 697.9m shares compared with 763.5m on
Friday, and traders warned of profit-taking pressure. Some analysts believe
that if French rate cuts are delayed, then London could be vulnerable to
further selling. But retail, or customer, business in UK equities has risen
sharply, returning a worth of Pounds 1.72bn last Friday and a similar figure
on Thursday.

FT  03 AUG 93 / London Stock Exchange: Vodafone advances
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and ZHANG TINGTING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mobile telecoms group Vodafone was the best performing stock in the sector
as it revealed new connections for July and also announced a new overseas
venture. The shares jumped 14 to 485p in good turnover of 5.3m. Market
whispers that the group was being eyed by AT&amp;T, the US company, were
dismissed by analysts. Last week, similar gossip had earmarked Cable and
Wireless for the same treatment. C&amp;W shares climbed 5 to 816p.
Vodafone said gross new connections for July totalled 31,724, taking the
overall total to neary 1m users. The company also said it had set up a joint
venture with Fiji Posts and Telecoms, the state-owned operator, to build and
operate a cellular telephone network.
A further slide in the price of Brent crude held back some oil stocks, with
Enterprise slipping 4 to 450p and Lasmo softening 2 to 134p.
The fallout in Lloyds Bank shares continued yesterday as a number of
analysts lowered forecasts following a disappointing meeting with the
company.
Credit Lyonnais Laing cut its 1994 forecast by 20 per cent to Pounds 1bn and
NatWest Securities pared its more gloomy estimate of Pounds 960m to Pounds
900m. NatWest also cut its figure for the year to 1995 by Pounds 500m to
Pounds 1bn. Lloyds fell 11 1/2 to 539p xd.
The prospect of further stimulus to any consumer recovery saw food retail
and stores sectors record two of the best performances of the session. Among
food retailers, Argyll rose 9 to 328p, Iceland Group 4 to 220p, Kwik Save 18
to 683p, J. Sainsbury 12 to 487p and Tesco 6 to 213 1/2 p.
Food manufacturing stocks also caught the positive mood, among which Unigate
put on 6 at 370p, United Biscuits 6 at 380p and Booker 10 at 411p.
In stores, Boots moved forward 8 to 457p, GUS 'A' 18 to 2000p and Next 5 1/2
to 191 1/2 p.
An initial strong burst in the leisure sector on interest rate hopes faded
late in the day, but most stocks stayed in positive territory. Main
beneficiaries were the tour operators, where Airtours rose 12 to 376p and
Owners Abroad 5 to 67p. Forte lost 2 to 214p as dealers spoke of a line of
stock overhanging, while a big buyer helped Friendly Hotels appreciate 8 to
210p.
There was no further news over the identity of potential suitors for Spring
Ram, the troubled bathroom products group, but the weekend speculation,
confirmed by the company yesterday, sent the shares shooting forward. They
closed 15 ahead at 69p. The company emphasised that negotiations were of a
'preliminary nature'.
Yield considerations continued to buoy selected electricity and water
issues. Among the Recs, Eastern moved ahead 15 to 516p, Manweb 9 to 557p and
Southern 14 to 524p. In waters, Anglian was 8 dearer at 502p and South West
finished 14 stronger at 530p.
Motor group BBA rose 9 to 176p in spite of a cautious annual statement as
the market concentrated on a jump in profits to Pounds 50.3m.
Under the limelight in the textile sector was William Baird, which
registered an advance of 7 to 255p on news of the disposal of part of its
engineering business. The group's refocus on its core businesses has led BZW
to change its recommendation on the stock from hold to buy. According to Ms
Julia Blake at BZW, the shares have been oversold and are still undervalued.
Another active stock was Coats Viyella, a main supplier of fabrics and soft
furnishings to Marks and Spencer. Its shares touched 245p before settling 5
up at 244p after volume of 2.8m.
Courtaulds Textiles advanced 13 to 558p on a strong recovery after a period
of weakness, while shares in clothing manufacturer SR Gent were pushed up 8
to 68p by overseas investors.
Ms Blake said the market was short of stock and that buying interest had
built up after some weeks of market depression.
In the publishing sector, United Newspapers, which has a high yield of more
than 5 per cent, gained 12 at 544p on market expectations of overall
interest rate cuts throughout Europe, where half of the group's advertising
revenue is generated.
Regional press group Home Counties Newspapers bounced 15 to 119p following
recent weakness.
Property shares were perky, with good gains being seen across the board.
British Land climbed 9 to 360p and Land Securities 6 to 634p, with Smith New
Court said to be recommending the stocks. Great Portland Estates firmed 5
1/2 to 193p and Hammerson 'A' 4 to 331p.

FT  03 AUG 93 / London Stock Exchange: Glaxo trembles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and ZHANG TINGTING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The prospect of Glaxo's forthcoming patent tussle was highlighted in the
Sunday press and sent the pharmaceutical group's shares down 13 1/2 to 534p.
The court case with drugs group Novopharm over the patent for Glaxo's
headline anti-ulcer drug Zantac starts next Monday. If Glaxo loses the case,
generic or unbranded versions of Zantac could be available in the US as
early as 1995, eating into the earnings of a product that represents some
two-thirds of Glaxo's profits.
Selling in London continued in New York and the concern gave dealers a
chance to take profits elsewhere in the sector. Wellcome suffered on
criticism of its latest Aids drug research and shed 4 to 683p, while
SmithKline Beecham was given a push by Nomura's pharmaceuticals team, which
argued that the stock had outperformed the sector and it was time to take
profits. SmithKline 'A' dipped 4 to 441p.

FT  03 AUG 93 / London Stock Exchange: Abbey strong
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and ZHANG TINGTING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Abbey National saw its share price move higher in the face of disappointing
results as the market focused on a possible cut in UK interest rates
following the changes to the European exchange rate mechanism.
The argument is that if ERM members cut rates the UK will have to follow
suit to remain competitive. Building societies will be able to lower their
rates to savers but leave their mortgage rates steady, thus improving profit
margins.
Mr John Wriglesworth, building societies analyst with UBS, said base rates
could fall by one percentage point but Abbey will only cut its lending rate
by a quarter of a point.
However, he argues that this would only give a short-term boost to a group
with long-term problems and he recommends selling into strength.
Abbey came in with profits of Pounds 301m against a market consensus of
Pounds 310 after heavy provisions. The share price was 14 ahead at the day's
best and closed 9 up at 392p after very high turnover of some 12m shares.

<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOPES OF an early cut in French interest rates prompted institutional
investors to seek out stocks with French exposure yesterday, inspiring some
smart share price rises. Publishing group Aegis, which earns a third of its
Pounds 2bn revenue in France, saw its shares climb 5 1/2 to 36 1/2 p.
Kingfisher, owner of the Darty chain of electrical shops, advanced 11 to
645p. NatWest Securities and Strauss Turnbull were reported positive. Marks
and Spencer added 9 at 363p.
Among drinks stocks, Guinness rose 8 to 466p. The company has a 24.6 per
cent cross-shareholding agreement with LVMH, the French luxury goods group,
which last week issued a profits warning. A marketing agreement with Remy
saw Highland Distilleries gain 6 at 328p. Elsewhere, MB-Caradon put on 6 at
299p.
Conversely, stocks with German exposure generally suffered, the view being
taken that rates will be slower to come down at the Bundesbank. Worst hit
were the building stocks Redland and RMC, both of which saw their shares
marked back. Carr Kitcat &amp; Aitken was one house advising a 'sell' on the
back of the large proportion of profits - around 67 per cent and 61 per cent
respectively - each company takes out of Germany. RMC retreated 12 to 793p
and Redland 10 to 505p.

FT  03 AUG 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INTEREST in the derivatives markets was enlivened by heavy buying from a big
overseas investor yesterday, the subsequent squeeze sending Footsie futures
up sharply, writes Peter John.
Overseas investors have been shifting funds into the UK via sterling and
government bonds as they look for a safe haven for currencies that also
offer a good return.
However, if falling interest rates in Europe prompt a cut in the UK, the
subsequent fall in bond yields will make the rate of return on the stock
market more attractive.
The contract on the FT-SE 100 for September delivery shot up to a strong
premium to the cash market in the morning and was trading 24 points higher
at one stage. This compares with a fair value, the premium that takes into
account dividends and carrying costs, of 4 points.
The effect of the buying was accentuated by a severe shortage of stock after
a week of heavy investing which has pushed the futures and underlying cash
market close to record highs in the past week.
However, when the overseas buying finished, some of the steam went out of
the rally and the spread between futures and cash narrowed. The premium had
declined to 15 by the official close, with some 11,000 contracts dealt.
The traded options market saw 32,000 lots transacted, with National Power
the most actively traded stock option.

FT  03 AUG 93 / World Stock Markets (America): US equities take their cue
from Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US SHARES rebounded yesterday after Friday's heavy selling, and prices
posted solid gains in the wake of sharply firmer overseas equity markets,
writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 21.52 at 3,560.99. The
more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 finished 2.02 higher at 450.15,
while the American SE composite gained 0.88 at 437.88 and the Nasdaq
composite was up 2.96 at 707.66. Trading volume on the New York SE totalled
230.4m shares.
After last week's late sell-off, which knocked nearly 30 points off the Dow,
the markets opened in an upbeat mood. Early morning gains in London, Paris
and Frankfurt stock markets, which reacted positively to the European
Community finance ministers' decision to ease restrictions in the European
exchange rate mechanism and allow currencies more room to fluctuate, boosted
prices from the start.
US investors hope the relaxing of the ERM bands will allow European
governments to lower their interest rates to boost local economic growth.
Stronger growth in Europe should mean stronger demand for US exports, a part
of the US economy that investors have been worried about lately.
There was also some, admittedly modest, good news at home, in the form of a
rise in the National Association of Purchasing Management's July index of
manufacturing activity. Although the index remains weak by normal
post-recession standards, the increase was seen by investors as a welcome
move in the right direction.
Among individual stocks, blue chips and cyclicals, which took the hardest
battering last Friday, rallied. Caterpillar gained Dollars 1 1/4 at Dollars
78 1/8 , Minnesota Mining &amp; Manufacturing put on Dollars 1 3/8 at Dollars
106 3/8 , Eastman Kodak firmed Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 54 1/4 and Coca-Cola
added Dollars 1/4 at Dollars 43 1/2.
Motor issues continued to outperform the market. Chrysler climbed Dollars
1/2 to Dollars 44 3/8 , Ford Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 54 5/8 and General
Motors Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 49 5/8.
Semiconductor shares were also in demand, lifted by positive comments about
the sector in the Wall Street Journal. Motorola advanced Dollars 3 3/4 to
Dollars 94 3/8 , Texas Instruments Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 71 5/8 and
National Semiconductor Dollars 1/2 to Dollars 16 3/4.
Boeing lost Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 39 on reports that the company may cut
aircraft production if it fails to land an important order from Saudi
Arabia.
On the Nasdaq market, Dell Computer firmed Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 21 in
volume of more than 1.6m shares on hopes that the company's performance will
improve following the introduction of new products and a new marketing
strategy.
TORONTO was closed for a public holiday.

FT  03 AUG 93 / World Stock Markets: New Zealand moves to a three-year high
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN PITT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In a week in which most investors' eyes were firmly fixed on the dramatic
events unfolding in Europe, there was still plenty of activity occurring
elsewhere to excite interest.
A sharp rise in the price of gold bullion lifted South Africa, and Mexico
gained ground on good Telmex results, while firmness in Japan on optimism
that the political impasse there might be settled contributed to a near 2
per cent local currency advance for the FT-Actuaries World index.
New Zealand achieved the second biggest gain on the week, just behind
Finland, with the local index recording a three-year peak in high volumes.
Sentiment was encouraged by better than expected three-month figures from
Telecom, with expectations of good full year figures.
Analysts commented that most of the buying was domestic, but followed a
trend elsewhere in the world, whereby investors are seeking out high
yielding stocks and moving funds into equities.
One of the few exceptions to an otherwise positive week in the global equity
markets was Singapore. Since the beginning of the year the Straits Times
Industrial index has advanced some 19 per cent; but from the all-time high
set at the end of May, the index has receded some 5 per cent.
Baring Securities, in a recent review of the market, says the current period
of consolidation is to be expected given the high level of expectation that
has been built into prices during the rally of the first half.
With the interim reports season under way, Baring expects strong
performances from the electronics and property sectors. With regard to the
latter, the broker cautions that 'bullish prospects have largely been built
into prices, which suggest that there is little scope for significant upward
price movements, even though trading volume will remain strong because of
abundant liquidity'.

FT  03 AUG 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Frankfurt strengthens after
ERM developments
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONTINENTAL bourses were generally encouraged by weekend developments,
although some consolidation might be expected over the next few days as the
expected round of interest rate cuts has, in many cases, already been
discounted, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT surprised many analysts by rising on the day, the DAX index
closing 11.85 higher at 1,815.08, having moved between a range of 1,823 and
1,795.
Turnover was DM6bn.
However, activity was reported as being confused after the weekend's events,
and the market is generally expected to remain slightly volatile until
longer term European trends become visible.
In spite of the likely loss of competitiveness in export markets, companies
with exposure did not suffer the expected declines. Volkswagen for instance
rose slightly, by 30 pfg to DM348.50, while BMW gained 50 pfg to DM544.00.
Mr Patrick Shields, of NatWest Securities, also noted strength in stores,
Karstadt was up DM14 or 2.5 per cent at DM575, and financials; while Viag,
up DM12.80 at DM436.50, was still benefiting from week old news of its
increased stake in Bayernwerke.
Allianz, one of the day's biggest gainers, up DM55 at DM2,315, was helped by
a buy recommendation from a domestic institution.
PARIS continued its uninterrupted rally with the CAC-40 index nudging close
to the all time record high, finishing up 43.15 or 2 per cent at 2,129.03.
Turnover eased back to FFr6.8bn from Friday's massive FFr11.5bn,
Goldman Sachs yesterday raised its 12-month forecast for the CAC-40 to
between 2,600-2,700, with expectations that it will reach 2,300 within the
next quarter.
Among the movers Axa gained FFr30 to FFr1,480, SocGen FFr22 to FFr662,
Bouygues FFr13 to FFr705, Carrefour FFr113 to FFr3,118 and LVMH by FFr69 to
FFr4,194.
AMSTERDAM drifted lower amid concern over the export sector, although there
were some notable exceptions to the general trend. The CBS Tendency index
ended off 1.20 or 1 per cent at 120.80.
Nomura's global equity strategists see a buying opportunity in the
Netherlands, recommending a switch into Dutch equities from France and
Switzerland, forecasting that the market will benefit from dollar strength.
Akzo, which releases second quarter results tomorrow, and Aegon were among
the day's gainers, with respective gains of 30 cents and Fl 1.30 to Fl
167.80 and Fl 87.60.
Polygram, due to release first half figures today, was off 50 cents at Fl
55.90, and Philips down 10 cents at Fl 31.10.
BRUSSELS put on 1.4 per cent to an all-time high with the strength of the
dollar improving the prospects for exporters. The Bel-20 index rose 18.27 to
1,344.63 in turnover of almost BFr1.57bn.
Electrabel, the interest rate sensitive electricity utility, was the day's
most active issue, rising BFr20 to BFr6,260.
MADRID moved firmly ahead at the opening, pulled higher by the strength of
equities and bond futures, but a subsequent strengthening of the peseta
against the dollar left many domestic investors taking profits. The general
index rose 2.78 to 272.74.
Gains were seen across the board but foreigners were active buyers of banks.
Argentaria led the sector higher, rising Pta210 to Pta5,560, with Banesto
Pta55 ahead at Pta2,225, BCH Pta20 ahead at Pta3,710 and BBV Pta60 firmer at
Pta3,290.
LISBON's BTA index rose 38.7 or 1.7 per cent to 2,296.3 as the central bank
cut its emergency rate for one day lending to resident banks to 13 per cent
from 14.5 per cent.
MILAN gave up some ground after a late round of profit-taking and the Comit
index finished 9.38 ahead at 572.81.
Trading was dominated by foreign demand for telecommunications issues. Sip,
the domestic telephone company, rose L59 to L2,973 in volume of 13.2m shares
while Stet, its parent, added L78 to L4,049 with almost 11m shares traded.
ZURICH was little changed as investors turned their attention to other
European markets and the SMI index finished 0.6 lower at 2,400.3.
VIENNA rebounded from opening levels in healthy volumes and the ATX index
gained 2.03 to 950.62, having picked up from a day's low of 929.36.
The early weakness was attributed to uncertainty in the wake of Europe's
currency turmoil, but the market received reassurance when German shares
began to gain.
COPENHAGEN closed 4 per cent ahead, the KFX index ending at 95.65. Unibank
Securities commented that the market has lagged the rest of Europe because
of the central bank's efforts to avoid a devaluation of the currency. 'Over
the last month the market has risen 1.1 per cent, while the Eurotrack has
risen by 6.7 per cent. However, following the ERM agreement the krone will
now fluctuate within a wider band ..with market estimates of between 5-10
per cent'.
STOCKHOLM's Affarsvarlden general index recorded another year's high, up
4.70 at 1,207.70. In HELSINKI the HEX index added 1.6 per cent, closing at
1,310.2, while NORWAY's All Share index was little altered, losing 0.16 to
531.26.
ISTANBUL rose 2.16 per cent as the market overcame uncertainty following
last Friday's resignation of Mr Rusdu Saracoglu, the central bank governor,
and the market index added 218.3 to 10,295.9.
Mr Saracoglu had quarrelled with Prime Minister Tansu Ciller over her plans
to cut interest rates and use central bank funds to finance deficits.

IN SPITE of a strong start as bullion held firm above Dollars 400 an ounce,
gold shares showed a downward trend through much of the day, the index
slipping 28 to 2,070. Industrials moved forward 12 to 4,610 and the overall
index shed 14 to 4,163.
De Beers ended 75 cents up at R86.75, while associate Anglos shed R3 to R150

Kloof firmed R1 to R402.
Doornfontein came off the day's low of R4.50 to finish a net 35 cents down

of about 6,000 workers in 1991 would not have helped general negative market
sentiment.

FT  03 AUG 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Strong yen prompts wave
of selling in export issues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE YEN'S strength prompted concern over the profitability of leading
exporters, and share prices lost ground with many investors inactive, writes
Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei average shed 36.61 to 20,343.53 after a day's high of 20,412.64
on arbitrage-linked buying during the first few minutes of trading, and a
low of 20,231.32 in the afternoon session.
Volume came to 210m shares, falling below 300m for the first time in three
trading days. Financial institutions reshuffled portfolios, while investment
trusts were inactive. Declines led advances by 616 to 336, with 196 issues
unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks slipped 5.12 to
1,654.79, but in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index edged up 0.31 to 1,250.92.
Export-oriented companies, including car manufacturers, electricals, and
precision instrument makers, were sold in response to the higher yen. Honda
Motor dipped Y30 to Y1,360, Hitachi Y16 to Y853 and Canon Y20 to Y1,340.
Steels and shipbuilders, already facing lower profits due to the higher yen,
also lost ground. Nippon Steel retreated Y5 to Y365 and Kawasaki Heavy
Industries Y3 to Y417.
A further rise in gold bullion prices supported mining shares. Mitsui Mining
and Smelting, the most active issue of the day, advanced Y11 to Y556, while
Sumitomo Metal Mining gained Y20 at Y1,090.
Profit-taking depressed Nikkatsu, the bankrupt movie producer, by Y5 to Y23.
The issue gained ground last week on reports that Namco, a video game maker,
was considering helping Nikkatsu's rehabilitation programme.
Banks were some of the few bright spots of the day. Speculation that
financial stocks will have a larger weighting in the new capitalisation
weighted futures index, which will replace the Nikkei 225 index later this
year, encouraged buying. Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank moved up Y10 to Y2,350 and
Mitsubishi Bank Y30 to Y2,930.
In Osaka, the OSE average declined 73.11 to 22,391.04 in volume of 8.4m
shares. Nintendo, the video game maker, weakened Y290 to Y9,500 on
profit-taking.
Roundup
A MIXED mood was again seen in the Pacific Rim.
AUSTRALIA was swept to a fresh post-1987 crash peak as bullion continued its
higher trend and the All Ordinaries index advanced 10.8 to 1,854.8 in
turnover of ADollars 355.8m.
Among gold stocks helping to push the golds marker 4.4 per cent ahead,
Poseidon and Kidston each rose 30 cents to ADollars 5.10 and ADollars 2.90
respectively.
Elsewhere, Foodland jumped 48 cents to ADollars 8.08 on news that it was
considering an ADollars 1.1bn merger with Davids Holdings.
MANILA continued its record-setting ways, again boosted by a rise by
Philippine Long Distance Telephone on Wall Street, an advance by gold prices
and aggressive buying. The composite index added 24.65, ending at an
all-time high of 1,775.86. PLDT climbed 25 pesos to 1,105 pesos, after a
Dollars  3/4 rise to Dollars 39 7/8 on Wall Street last Friday.
SINGAPORE was boosted by banking stocks, which forged ahead in response to
an earnings report by United Overseas Bank. The Straits Times Industrial
index firmed 4.24 to 1,813.24.
NEW ZEALAND followed last week's rise to a three-year high with a solid
session which saw the NZSE-40 capital index recover from an early 9.67-point
retreat to end only a net 0.71 easier at 1,815.33.
Small companies had a particularly strong day, with the NZSE smaller
companies capital index rising 72.1 to 4,180.8.
TAIWAN ended softer after trading narrowly in the lowest turnover since
January. The weighted index, which moved in a 21-point range, closed 13.82
down at 3,946.56. Turnover shrank to TDollars 8.93bn from the TDollars
9.62bn registered in the shortened Saturday session.
SEOUL suffered from institutional sales, exacerbated by stop-loss selling by
individual investors, which left the market lower for the fifth straight
session. The composite index shed 10.49 to 719.45.
The market is under pressure from the redemption of Won2,900bn in special
central bank loans to investment trusts next week.
HONG KONG finished off an early peak, although the Hang Seng index
maintained a 40.47 advance to end at 7,029.03.
KUALA LUMPUR extended Friday's losses on further liquidation with investors
concerned over the market's direction. The composite index lost 2.62 to
763.46.
BANGKOK closed at the day's high after strong demand for property and
building material companies. The SET index put on 10.04, or 1.1 per cent, at
938.24.

FT  03 AUG 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Pressure on franc and krone
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE French franc and the Danish krone came under strong selling pressure
yesterday after their bands in the European exchange rate mechanism had been
widened to 15 per cent against the D-Mark and Dutch guilder, writes James
Blitz.
The removal of their former ERM floors against the D-Mark encouraged dealers
to push both currencies to levels at which they were undervalued on a trade
weighted basis.
Both the franc and krone recovered at the end of a European session in which
trading was mostly thin. But the rally in their currencies was mainly a
result of the decision by both countries' central banks to keep monetary
policy tight.
In France's case, the intervention rate was kept unchanged at 6.75 per cent,
even though the franc's new floor of FFr3.8948 could easily permit another
cut in rates. This meant that, although the franc fell as low as FFr3.55 to
the D-Mark in the European morning, it later climbed back to a London close
of FFr3.505.
Denmark took a more aggressive stance, maintaining its one-month interest
rates at 25 per cent. This allowed the Danish krone to come back to a London
close of DKr4.0367 to the D-Mark after it had plunged as low as DKr4.1500.
Belgium actively tried to maintain its currency within its former bands,
intervening to support the Belgian franc at BFr21.50 to the D-Mark.
The overwhelming feature of the market yesterday was the uncertainty of
central banks over what action to take, now that the ERM has virtually
collapsed. 'There is a policy confusion over whether to go down the
competitive devaluation route, or whether to stick close to the D-Mark,'
commented Mr Robin Marshall, chief economist at Chase Manhattan Bank.
All European countries want economic growth to stimulate their economies.
But, in France, the danger of competitive devaluation is that it could
seriously embarrass the government of Mr Edouard Balladur, who was committed
to the franc fort policy.
However, Mr George Soros, head of the Soros fund in New York which takes
active positions in currencies, told the Financial Times that France could
cut interest rates tomorrow without any further pressure on the franc.
For Belgium and Denmark, analysts see strong risks of disorderly
devaluations that could impinge on their bond and equity markets - placing a
burden on them to keep interest rates high. But, here again, Mr Soros felt
that rates could be lowered without long term depreciation.
Yesterday's appreciation of the D-Mark in Europe helped to push the dollar
down 2 1/2 pfennigs to a close of DM1.7155. The dollar was also trading at a
post-war low of Y104.05 in early US trading. Sterling ended 3 pfennigs off
at DM2.5550 amid speculation of a base rate reduction in the UK. In New York
the dollar closed at DM1.7080 and Y104.40.

FT  03 AUG 93 / Money Markets: No instant rate cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHANIE FLANDERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN money markets were kept guessing yesterday as the major ERM central
banks chose not to exercise their new freedom to cut interest rates, writes
Stephanie Flanders.
By the end of the first day's trading, only Portugal had rushed to ease
monetary conditions, lowering its emergency lending rate to 13.0 per cent
from 14.5 per cent. The Bank of France signalled early on that there would
be no immediate official rate reduction, leaving the key intervention rate
at 6.75 per cent.
At least some in the market must have been disappointed by the French
central bank's show of restraint, because afternoon trading brought French
franc futures down a little from their morning highs. The September Pibor
contract closed in Paris at 94.09, still 37 basis points higher than
Friday's close, but lower than the 94.48 seen early yesterday.
Analysts said one should expect lower official rates in France in the near
future, but possibly not as early as this week. 'You would not have expected
rate cuts today,' said a London economist. 'But what is the point of such a
wide band if you are not going to lower rates quite substantially?'
Several observers now expect French discount rate to fall below 5 per cent
over the next two or three months. French call money finished Monday down
from the levels seen during the previous week's turbulence, at around 9 7/8
per cent on the bid side.
The Danish and Belgian central banks also chose not to cut interest rates.
Denmark's central bank offered a special four-week liquidity pact at a fixed
25 per cent yield, and announced that the 14-day repo rate would remain
fixed at last week's level of 11 per cent. But one source said the high
Danish rate was unlikely to stay in place very long: 'I expect the repo rate
to fall, if not at Thursday's tender, then almost certainly by the end of
next week.'
Sterling markets had a slightly less bearish flavour than during the latter
part of last week. But on balance, traders still seemed to believe that the
ERM revamp would mean speedier reductions in UK official rates. The
September sterling contract lost 7 basis points to close at 94.38, but the
implied expectation of 5.62 per cent three-month money by the autumn remains
significantly lower than a week ago.

RUSSIA MAY enjoy a sharply improved grain harvest this year of between 120m
and 125m tonnes, up from 106.8m tonnes last year, the deputy prime minister
responsible for agriculture said yesterday.
Deputy prime minister Alexander Zaveryukha also confirmed an official
estimate of grain imports falling to 16m tonnes from 26m last year.
The harvest figure he quoted was higher than the recent estimate of 110m to
114m tonnes which was cited by the federal weather service. It is also much
higher than the 94.1m tonnes projected for the Russian Federation by the
International Wheat Council in a report published last week.
The IWC put 1993 Russian wheat output at 43m tonnes, compared with 46m
tonnes last year, and coarse grains output at 51.1m tonnes, compared with
55.6m tonnes.

FT  03 AUG 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: UK grain farmers grapple with
new variables - Currency volatility and floods in the Mississippi basin
promise storms for harvesters / Farmer's Viewpoint
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LEGEND of St Swithin lives on. It rained on his day, July 15, and
precipitation seems set to continue for most of the following 40 days.
Nevertheless, weather permitting, the UK cereals harvest will need to swing
fully into gear in the next few days. Most farmers in the south have already
dodged the storms and showers of the past couple of weeks to make a
stuttering start at combine harvesting their winter sown barley fields.
Spring sown barley is now almost ready too, as are the earliest fields of
winter sown wheat. Little harvesting has so far been carried out in the
north but the only thing delaying it is the lack of a dry spell.
The weather, good or bad, is a frustrating variable that is usually accepted
by farmers with equanimity. Variations in supply and demand are recognised
as inevitable influences on returns, although many farmers have not yet come
fully to terms with the fact of declining guaranteed prices and less secure
market outlets as a result of CAP reforms.
International currency volatility is the relatively new variable over which
farmers realise they also have no control.
Let us consider those variables in turn.
First supply and demand: in the past few years UK farmers have grown about
22m tonnes of cereal a year while domestic demand has been about 16m tonnes,
leaving 6m tonnes for export. By good fortune as well as good farming the
recent quality of UK grain has been good enough to attract buyers from
abroad to take up almost every tonne of the country's domestic surplus.
The British balance of trade had benefited to the tune of some Pounds 750m a
year and UK intervention stores have been virtually unused. Mainly as a
result of new set-aside regulations the exportable surplus could well be
halved this year.
Questions, however, are being asked about the suitability and price of some
UK grain for export. Much of the barley harvested in the south and west of
England is reported to be thin and to contain high percentages of screenings
 -undersized grains which fall through a sieve designed to screen them out
of the sample. If the proportion falling through the sieve is greater than 6
per cent, and reports suggest that in many samples it is up to 12 per cent,
the barley is only fit for animal feed.
Most samples of malting barley from East Anglia are better than that and
should, on the face of it, be ideal for the export trade. But Denmark,
Britain's greatest competitor for export markets, is reported to have a big
crop, although it is still in the fields. And France, which harvests its
crops before more northerly nations, has already begun to supply barley to
breweries in Belgium and elsewhere at prices British merchants would find
difficult to match.
It has also been estimated that France has 500,000 tonnes of malting barley
available for export and Denmark a potential 700,000 tonnes. The total
demand across the European Community - now that the old East Germany is
supplying all that the old West Germany needs - is a mere 500,000 tonnes.
It is hardly surprising therefore that the prices being bid for UK malting
barley are only about Pounds 120 a tonne for the very best samples and much
less than that for anything of lower quality. This figure represents a
reduction from last year's best prices of up to Pounds 50 per tonne, the
benefit from which will doubtless be pocketed by the brewers. It would be
surprising and entirely out of character if they cut the price of a pint of
beer.
One of the reasons why the French are able to undercut British exporters is
the decline in the value of the French franc and the relative strength of
sterling. Even before last weekend French merchants were gambling on the
value of their currency falling. They were selling grain in other harder
currencies on the assumption that they would soon be able to buy more French
francs with them. The immediate effect was to reduce the bid price for
British barley by Pounds 5 per tonne.
Paradoxically the British merchants and the farmers who supplied them were
in a similar situation last September when sterling fell out of the currency
system. It is not so pleasant when the boot is on the other foot.
British guarantee prices for basic commodities, such as feed barley and
wheat, as compared with specialist products like malting barley, however,
are still substantially better than they would have been without the
devaluation of the pound.
And then there is the perennial problem of the weather - here and abroad. In
Britain farmers are already worrying about the prospect of an unsettled
period, which would make harvesting difficult and expensive. Not only are
there more machine breakages in moist conditions as cutter bars of combine
harvesters are forced to run close to the ground to pick up the flattened
corn, but there are also extra costs of drying the grain. Such weather
conditions inevitably lead to lower quality, lower value samples.
Meanwhile, the floods in the Mississippi basin could affect EC arable
farmers' returns. There is no doubt that US farmers whose land has been
under flood water for several weeks will have no crops to harvest and could
face ruin without government support. What is less clear - and conflicting
reports and a volatile trade in Chicago confuse the situation even more - is
to what extent the floods will cut overall US production of maize and
soyabeans.
But if US maize production and carry over stock is significantly reduced,
which I suspect is unlikely, the price of EC wheat, which can be used as an
alternative animal feed ingredient, could rise. And if the floods lead to a
shortage of soyabeans, which is more likely - prices suggest this is already
the case - that too could give a lift to other commodity markets. If US soya
supplies become scarce the cost of vegetable protein around the world will
increase.
It is interesting to note that the last time there was such a soya shortage
was in 1973. Then US President Nixon reacted by imposing an embargo on
exports and the price of available supplies from South America and the like
trebled. This was the main reason why the EC introduced its subsidy system
for oilseeds and protein - a system which threatened to derail the recent
General Agreement of Tariffs and Trade negotiations.
A similar soya supply situation may occur again just as the possibility of
freer trade looms on the horizon.
How fascinating it will be to see President Clinton's reaction if such a
scenario materialises.

The ALUMINIUM market broke out of its recent narrow range yesterday, with
the London Metal Exchange's three months delivery position closing Dollars
11.75 higher at Dollars 1,230.50 a tonne, and moving on to Dollars 1,236 a
tonne in after-hours trading. Dealers said the resistance band between
Dollars 1,220 and Dollars 1,230 that had prevailed over the past two weeks
was overcome by influential European buying and investment fund interest,
which triggered stop-loss buying orders during the late kerb. The NICKEL
market was steadier, as prices were 'corrected' on technical grounds, having
become oversold recently. Three months metal closed on the LME at Dollars
4,975 a tonne, recovering Dollars 35 of Friday's Dollars 87.50 fall. At the
London Commodity Exchange COCOA futures emulated the buoyant coffee market
(see story above) with the September position ending Pounds 9 up on the day
at Pounds 773 a tonne. Dealers said the market continued to monitor
developments in West Africa, where many analysts are predicting poor crops,
but otherwise felt prices were building towards a potential move higher.
PRECIOUS METALS eased back from early, foreign exchange-inspired highs.

FT  03 AUG 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Tight cotton stocks may boost
prices
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
WORLD COTTON prices should rise moderately during 1993-94 and 1994-95
because of tight stocks outside China, according to the International Cotton
Advisory Committee.
It said the Cotlook A Index could rise from an average of 58 cents a lb
during the current season to 65 cents in 1993-94 and 70 cents two seasons
from now.
The committee, which groups 44 cotton producing and consuming countries,
said stocks outside China were equal to the 1989-90 low of 38 per cent of
use. It added that estimates of 1993-94 world production had tightened in
recent months.
Production estimates for India and central Asia were reduced to a combined
240,000 tonnes during July. Estimated production in China for 1993-94 was
4.4m tonnes, a drop of 350,000 since June.
'Expectations of lower cotton area in China have been buttressed by
government estimates, while reports of pest infestations and low morale
among cotton farmers have prompted downward revisions in yields,' the ICAC
said.

FT  03 AUG 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Indonesia's soya imports to
soar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM KEELING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JAKARTA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INDONESIA'S IMPORTS of soyabean meal are likely to rise 150 per cent to
250,000 metric tonnes in the marketing year beginning October 1 following
the removal of a 35 per cent import surcharge last June, according to a
report by the US embassy in Jakarta.
The report said Indonesian companies supplying feed to the poultry and
livestock industry have indicated 'tremendous interest in importing
(soyabean) meal' now that it is price competitive with alternatives such as
fish, cottonseed and rapeseed meal.
The greatest beneficiary of the relaxed regime was likely to be India, which
at present accounted for 44 per cent of Indonesia's soyabean imports. The
embassy expected the US to increase its exports from 20,000 tonnes in the
current marketing year to 60,000 tonnes next year.
Industry officials noted, however, that the government still protected the
domestic crushing industry by demanding that feed companies continue to
purchase 40 per cent of soyabean meal from Sarpindo, a privately owned
company, which has a domestic crushing monopoly.
The report painted a mixed picture of Indonesia's other oilseed industries,
oil palm and coconut.
Palm oil exports were forecast to rise 32.6 per cent to 1.6m tonnes in the
year to September 30, and then to 1.85m tonnes next year, while total
production would rise from 3.25m tonnes to 3.6m tonnes.
'Sustained growth will help boost (palm oil) production near the
government's goal of 6m tonnes by the end of the century,' said the report.
Coconut copra production, however, was forecast to fall 13 per cent this
calendar year to 1.15m tonnes, before making a partial recovery to 1.2m
tonnes in 1994.
Coconut oil exports were expected to decline 15 per cent this year to
690,000 tonnes, rising next year to 750,000 tonnes.

2 1/2 -year highs

<TEXT>
COFFEE PRICES leapt to their highest levels for nearly two and a half years
on the London market yesterday after a light frost hit some growing areas in
Brazil and Latin American exporters agreed details of their new cartel.
The November futures price for robusta - the new second position - touched
Dollars 1,104 a tonne, its highest level since March 1991, before easing to
close at Dollars 1,074, up Dollars 31.
The initial rush to buy was mirrored in New York, where the December arabica
contract reached a peak of 81.15 cents a lb in early trading before easing
to 79.9 cents later, up 0.85 cents.
Fund and speculative buying as well as trade interest fuelled the rise in
London, surprising traders who had expected little change in prices.
The unexpected cold spell in Brazil, the world's largest producer, affected
parts of the southern state of Parana where only 10 per cent of the coffee
is grown, and appeared to be short-lived.
There were no initial reports of damage to trees.
Uncertainty about the effect on next year's crop, however, excited a market
already bullish about the possibility of tighter supplies following the
Latin American export retention scheme agreed at the end of last week.
'We've had a good rise on the market and technically and fundamentally it
may have done enough for the moment,' said one trader, adding that the
implications of the Latin American plan had already been largely absorbed.
Latin American producers, anxious to lift prices after the collapse earlier
this year of talks on reviving the international coffee export quota system,
agreed their new scheme would run from October 1.
They plan to hold back 20 per cent of exports if the indicator price set by
the International Coffee Organisation remains below 75 cents a lb. If it
rises to between 75 cents and 80 cents they will retain only 10 per cent,
while for a rise between 80 cents and 85 cents they will neither hold back
stocks nor release those retained.
A price of 85 cents a lb or more would trigger the release of stocks on to
world markets, with a new management committee deciding when and how this
should be done. The ICO price is currently just below 62 cents.
'They're coming up with a very realistic plan and not setting their sights
too high in terms of prices,' said Mr Lawrence Eagles, commodities analyst
with London broker GNI. 'But there's still a question mark as to how long it
can last with producers alone and how consumers will react.'
The Latin Americans, accounting for more than 50 per cent of world
production, will take their scheme to a meeting of the world's main coffee
exporters in Kampala on August 16 and 17. Consuming countries' responses
should become clear at the International Coffee Organisation meeting on
September 16.

FT  03 AUG 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Sumitomo rejects copper squeeze
speculation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR YASUO Hamanaka, the senior manager responsible for Sumitomo Corporation's
copper trading operations, has been described by many London Metal Exchange
traders as the single most powerful man in the copper market.
So it is not surprising that his name has been mentioned most frequently in
discussions about the 'squeeze' threatening to create turmoil on the LME's
market in September and October.
One trader said yesterday that Sumitomo had reached a position 'where if it
were October today, it would control all the LME stocks'.
There have been other widespread suggestions that the copper market is being
manipulated to boost the price even though stocks in LME warehouses are at a
15-year peak. The LME board has voiced its concern by twice giving warnings
that it has the authority to take any action necessary to maintain an
orderly market.
Mr Hamanaka, however, denied that Sumitomo - or any other organisation  -
was attempting to manipulate copper prices upwards. 'It would be impossible
to do so when demand (for the metal) is so fundamentally weak,' he said.
Sumitomo is one of the world's leading traders of physical copper, as
distinct from the 'paper' variety on futures exchanges. It handles 500,000
tonnes a year for clients, mainly in Asia and the Far East but increasingly
in Europe too.
Like many other Japanese corporations, Sumitomo is forbidden to speculate in
commodities markets. Nevertheless, it does hedge its copper market dealings
by trading futures and options along with buying copper for immediate
delivery. In this way it exerts a tremendous influence on the market.
Mr Hamanaka suggested the acute supply tightness that had developed on the
LME market between September and October was highly technical and could be
traced to the steep fall in copper prices in May, from which 'there had to
be some reaction'.
He added that the backwardation (premium for metal for immediate delivery)
for September to three months could not be justified.
It was unlikely to become unusually large and would probably range between
Dollars 10 and Dollars 30 a tonne. (During a similar squeeze in 1991, when
the LME still quoted copper in sterling, the LME board took the
unprecedented step of limiting the backwardation to Pounds 25 a tonne a day
after it threatened to go above Pounds 100).
'Demand (for copper) in Europe is weak. The US is recovering but is not
booming. The Asian market is steady but only average,' Mr Hamanaka pointed
out.
Mainland China would probably consume 800,000 tonnes of copper this year,
compared with domestic production of about 500,000 tonnes, and Sumitomo
estimated that 40,000 to 50,000 tonnes of the metal was shipped from Europe
to China in July. 'I hear the Chinese will continue to take more copper to
stockpile.'

FT  03 AUG 93 / Government Bonds: Ministers' decision to widen ERM bands
provides lift
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPE'S government bond markets roared ahead yesterday as the decision by
European Community finance ministers at the weekend to widen the currency
fluctuation bands of the European exchange rate mechanism was seen as paving
the way for interest rate cuts across the continent.
Market participants are hoping to see interest rates slashed as governments
attempt to inject new life into the recession-hit economies of Europe,
although yesterday saw no sudden moves to ease.
'I expect the central banks will wait for some of the foreign exchange dust
to settle before cutting rates,' said Mr Kit Juckes, economist at SG Warburg
Securities.
Among the higher-yielding bond markets, Italy showed very strong gains, with
the Liffe futures contract jumping nearly two points during the day - from
Friday's close of 106.12 to a high of 107.90 yesterday - on expectations of
an easing. The market took heart from remarks by Mr Antonio Fazio, the
central bank governor, that the EC currency accord had removed an obstacle
to lower rates.
Spanish government bonds shot higher and gained over a point on the day.
Dealers said the market would be paying close attention to today's repo
tender to see whether the Bank of Spain cuts its 11 per cent key money rate.
FRENCH government bond prices ended the day sharply higher even though the
Banque de France left its key interest rates alone, giving market
participants the clear impression that the central bank will not rush to cut
interest rates.
'It's more likely that the central bank will wait for the markets to calm
down and stabilise before it cuts interest rates,' said one dealer.
The French franc held up fairly well in the foreign exchange markets and as
bond prices rallied the yield on the 10-year OAT fell below the equivalent
yield on German government debt.
GERMAN government bonds gained a quarter-point yesterday, underperforming
other European bond markets but still benefiting from the market's
safe-haven status.
Mr Schlesinger's remarks yesterday that the Bundesbank would allow call
money rates to fall below the discount rate were seen as indicating that the
repo rate will shift lower.
Dealers reported good buying of medium-dated and 10-year bunds as the
Bundesbank's refusal to cave in and cut interest rates - even at a time of
crisis in the European exchange rate mechanism - served to lift confidence
in the central bank's long-term commitment to defeating inflation. Details
of a new 10-year bund issue are expected today.
UK government bonds ended little changed as investors switched their
attention to continental Europe. The index-linked sector made the strongest
gains on hopes of a fall in real yields across Europe.
US TREASURY prices were mixed across the maturity range yesterday as the
bond market kept a close eye on passage of President Bill Clinton's budget
package.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  3/32 at 107
3/8 , yielding 6.554 per cent.
At the short end of the market, the two-year note was down  1/8 at 100 3/32
, to yield 4.184 per cent.
The day's main economic news - a slight increase in the National Association
of Purchasing Management's July index of economic activity - was in line
with expectations, and had little impact on market sentiment.
Attention was otherwise firmly fixed on Congress, where Mr Clinton was
making last-minute efforts to ensure his budget was passed by lawmakers this
week.
Treasury investors are keen to see the budget passed. This is primarily
because they view it as the first serious attempt by a US government to
tackle the large federal budget deficit. Any sign that Mr Clinton's budget
might fall at the final hurdle, therefore, could unsettle bond prices.
JAPANESE government bonds surged ahead as the strength of the yen against
the dollar and other currencies continued to fuel hopes of a cut in the
official discount rate.
The yen touched a new high on Friday of 104.25 to the dollar, and traded at
around 104.75 to the dollar yesterday. The September futures contract, which
opened at 110.98, reached a high of 111.42 before ending Tokyo trading at
111.30. In the cash market, the yield on the No 145 issue ended the day at
4.155 per cent, having traded in a range of 4.135 and 4.175 per cent.

FT  03 AUG 93 / International Capital Markets: Italy, UK paper best European
markets in July
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ITALY and the UK, two former members of the European exchange rate
mechanism, were the top performing European government bond markets in July,
according to figures compiled by JP Morgan Securities.
Italian bonds showed a return of 2.77 per cent in local currency terms,
followed by the gilt market with a return of 2.5 per cent - well above the
average European bond return of 1.33 per cent.
'The Italian bond market's strong showing was reinforced after the Bank of
Italy cut its discount rate by a full percentage point,' according to JP
Morgan Securities.
'The Ciampi government has remained firm in its resolve to hold down
inflation in spite of lira depreciation. Additionally, agreements to
overhaul labour market institutions gave investors greater confidence that
lower rates of inflation would prevail,' the US house said.
The gilt market's rally was prompted by continued favourable economic data
showing that inflation was at its lowest level in 30 years.
In addition, sterling assets provided a safe haven for many investors as the
European exchange rate mechanism came under attack last month.
Several of the European currencies - in particular the French franc, Belgian
franc, peseta and Danish krone - suffered renewed bouts of turbulence at the
end of July, triggered by the Bundesbank's decision to leave its
keenly-watched discount rate unchanged while cutting the Lombard (or
effective ceiling) rate by 50 basis points.
French government bonds gained only 0.75 per cent on the month, while the
Belgian, Ecu and Danish bond markets were the worst performers with falls of
0.29 per cent, 0.44 per cent and 0.99 per cent respectively.
'The international government bond markets have provided investors with
positive returns during the month of July (with the exception of Belgium and
Denmark). The main factors bolstering global bond markets were yet more
signs of moderating inflation,' says JP Morgan Securities.
The Australian government bond market ranked as the third best performing
market with a monthly return of 2.37 per cent helped by low second-quarter
inflation figures.

THE Indian Opportunities Fund, an offshore open-ended fund, has raised
Dollars 100m from international investors who want to invest in the Indian
stock market through a managed investment vehicle.
The fund will be managed by Martin Currie, the Edinburgh-based fund
management group, and Indbank, the Indian merchant bank.
It was set up offshore in order to provide international investors with
access to the Indian stock market without the need to pay capital gains tax
or withholding tax.
International investor interest in the Indian market has been stimulated by
the government's economic reform programme.
The Bulgarian government has backed a proposal to swap state enterprise
debts for government bonds and aims to give its final approval on August 18,
officials said, Reuter reports from Sofia.
The proposed bonds will have a 20-year maturity, five-year grace period and
10 per cent interest on the lev credit and six-month London inter-bank
offered rate on the currency bonds, both payable twice a year.

FT  03 AUG 93 / International Company News: Amax/Cyprus mining link hits
snag
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PROPOSED merger between US mining groups Amax and Cyprus Minerals has
run into problems with the authorities. The US justice department is using
anti-trust regulations to request more information about their molybdenum
businesses.
Both groups said they were willing to work with the deparment to resolve any
anti-trust difficulties, but Amax said that 'there can be no assurance that
the companies will be able to satisfy any objections the department of
justice may have to the merger'.
Molybdenum, is a versatile and cost-effective alloying agent in special
steels, cast irons, nickel, cobalt and titanium-based alloys. In the
chemicals sector, molybdenum is used in catalysts, lubricants and pigments.
Cyprus owns the Thompson Creek molybdenum mine in Idaho, which produced 40m
lb last year, and the mothballed Tonopah mine in Nevada. Amax has two mines
in Colorado: the Henderson, which produced 33m lb in 1992, and the Climax,
also mothballed.
Amax and Cyprus announced in May that they wanted to merge their core
operations into a group with assets worth Dollars 5bn and revenues of
Dollars 2.8bn. This would be the second-largest copper producer and the
second-largest coal producer in the US.
However, Amax's aluminium operations would be spun off to shareholders as a
separate company. Amax hoped to clear regulatory hurdles and obtain
shareholder approvals by the end of this year.

</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CIGNA, one of the US's largest insurers, reported a sharp reduction in
earnings in the second quarter, caused by losses in its general commercial
insurance business and reduced investment gains.
Post-tax profits were Dollars 88m or Dollars 1.22 a share, down from Dollars
130m or Dollars 1.81, a year ago. First-half net income fell to Dollars
134m, from Dollars 237m, before the effect of accounting changes.
The general commercial business, which covers property/casualty risks for
medium-sized US companies, suffered from poor underwriting and pressure on
premium rates, the company said. It added that the senior management of this
part of its business had been replaced earlier this year and that it had
reduced its involvement in the area.
As a result, Cigna's property/casualty division reported losses of Dollars
79m (before after-tax investment gains of Dollars 34m), compared with a loss
of Dollars 55m (before gains of Dollars 41m) the year before.
The escalating losses came in spite of a marked fall in catastrophe losses,
which were Dollars 15m pre-tax, compared with Dollars 55m for the same
period in 1992.
Net income from the employee life and health benefits area on the other
hand, climbed to Dollars 104m (before after-tax investment gains of Dollars
7m) from Dollars 67m (before gains of Dollars 30m).
Net income from employee retirement and savings benefits fell by Dollars 2m
to Dollars 36m, due to an Dollars 8m investment loss, compared with a
Dollars 4m loss a year ago.

MOTOROLA of the US and Canada's Northern Telecom have halted sales of
cellular telecommunications equipment from a joint venture formed by the
companies last year, writes Louise Kehoe.
The venture had been expected to generate revenues of between Dollars 500m
and Dollars 1bn, but industry executives said it had been dogged by
disagreements over cellular telephone technology standards.
Although the venture has not been terminated, its sales activities have been
curtailed and most employees will be re-employed by the parent companies.

<TEXT>
ASAHI Breweries, a leading Japanese brewer, reported a rise in
non-consolidated pre-tax profits at the halfway stage, despite a fall in
sales.
The company posted a 7.4 per cent increase, to Y8.5bn (Dollars 81m), in
pre-tax profits for the first six months to June, due to its rationalisation
efforts.
Sales fell 2.3 per cent to Y349bn. After-tax profits, however, plunged 22.3
per cent to Y2.4bn due to a rise in corporate taxes.
In spite of the sharp fall in after-tax profits, Asahi said it would pay an
unchanged half-year dividend of Y4 a share.
Asahi attributed the fall in sales to the separation of its foods division
in July last year. In addition, bad weather and a decline in consumer
spending depressed beer sales, which fell 0.7 per cent to Y292.2bn.
The bad weather also affected sales of non-alcoholic beverages, which
declined 3.8 per cent to Y46.3bn.
Revenue from its real estate division dropped 19.6 per cent to Y7.4bn due to
the continuing slump in the property market.
Wine sales fell 1.6 per cent to Y1.2bn and drug sales 71 per cent to Y991m.
For the full year to December, Asahi expects a 3.6 per cent rise in
non-consolidated pre-tax profits to Y14.5bn on a 1.9 per cent increase in
sales to Y785bn.

ASEA Brown Boveri, the Swedish-Swiss energy and engineering group, and
Deutsche Babcock, the German engineering company, have won a DM730m (Dollars
429.4m) contract from the Greek government to supply equipment for the new
Spata airport on the outskirts of Athens.
ABB's German-based Schaltanlage and Leitungsbau subsidiaries, which
manufacture switch gears and energy wires, will provide electrical equipment
worth DM410m for the airport's terminals and for the runway lighting
systems.
Krantz TKT, a subsidiary of Balcke-Durr, owned by Deutsche Babcock, is
expected to provide most of the remaining electrical equipment.
Infrastructure at the Spata airport will be built by Hochtief.
The whole project is estimated to be worth around DM4bn. The Greek
government wants to create a Sparta airport company to handle the
development and the operations of the airport.
The airport, due for completion in 1998, will have a capacity of 16m
passengers a year.

FT  03 AUG 93 / International Company News: IBM and Dell try new approaches
to US marketing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INTERNATIONAL Business Machines and Dell Computer of the US yesterday
introduced products and marketing approaches designed to address the
increasingly segmented personal computer market.
In the US, IBM formed Ambra, a personal computers sales subsidiary, to
target 'price-sensitive PC customers who prefer purchasing through the
direct channel'.
Ambra will sell its own brand of PCs, built by sub-contractors, through mail
and telephone orders.
The formation of Ambra US follows similar moves last year by IBM in Europe
and Canada. It will offer a broad range of desktop and notebook PCs, aimed
at the US market and substantially different from Ambra-branded products in
Europe and Canada, the company said. Marketing and service functions will
also be sub-contracted to other companies.
Through Ambra, IBM is also attempting to broaden the scope of its PC
marketing to cover market that its own brand products do not address.
The new company aims to capture a significant portion of the Dollars 10bn
direct-response market in the US, which at the moment is catered for by
Dell, Gateway 2000 and Zeos.
Dell announced a series of desktop PC systems, services and support programs
aimed at specific types of PC buyers.
'The old categories that computer companies have used - home versus
business, large versus small, low-priced versus high-performance - no longer
suffice,' said Mr Michael Dell, chairman and chief executive.
Wang Laboratories, the US computer group, said it could emerge from Chapter
11 bankruptcy protection as early as autumn this year, Reuter reports. The
company said it had reached agreement in principal on the private placement
of Dollars 60m in 12 per cent exchangeable preferred stock and warrants to
purchase 3.6m shares of the new common stock that Wang will issue as part of
its reorganisation plan. Hewlett Packard has cut prices of its DeskJet brand
inkjet PC printers by between 9 per cent and 22 per cent.

FT  03 AUG 93 / International Company News: Murdoch bets on channels' star
potential - The media investor's latest prize puts 3bn viewers within reach
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT is undoubtedly a glittering prize. Mr Rupert Murdoch can potentially
distribute his vast programming resources to half the world's population,
and many of its fastest-growing economies, following his acquisition of
Asian satellite broadcaster Star Television.
Less clear, however, is whether the myriad of Asian government regulations
will allow this giant consumer market to tune in; and whether the 3bn people
in the satellite's giant footprint will actually want to watch, in the face
of growing competition from other broadcasters.
Mr Murdoch is faced with the governments of countries - China, Singapore,
Malaysia and Indonesia - with a tradition of being suspicious of western
media, and with an intimidating spectrum of languages and tastes to satisfy.
In fact, as he relaxes on his yacht, basking in the satisfaction of his
victory in a four-man bidding war for the company, Mr Murdoch is faced with
few certainties from this achievement.
He has unarguably proved a benefactor to Hong Kong investors, who had looked
upon Star as a financial liability for owner Hutchison Whampoa. They have
been delighted with a pay-back of six times the cost of their investment,
representing an extraordinary profit of HKDollars 1.5bn (Dollars 194m).
However, News Corporation's shareholders may have to wait a lot longer. It
is estimated that Star may have accumulated losses of up to USDollars 200m
by the end of 1995.
Wishing upon this Star, however, could make shareholders' dreams come true.
News Corp already owns a vast library of programmes to add to Star's
existing five channels: Prime Sports, MTV Asia, BBC World Service
Television, a Mandarin channel and Star Plus, a family entertainment
channel.
It also has the technical expertise to introduce digital compression and
encryption to Star, enabling it to spawn 50 or more channels, avoiding
piracy and ekeing greater yields from its Twentieth Century Fox and Fox
Television libraries.
In the short term, it is Star's existing markets of India and Taiwan which
will sustain earnings. Taiwan is busy regulating a network of an estimated
400 illegal cable operators, which are bringing in fees of around TDollars
10bn (USDollars 378m).
In India, Star has been nothing short of a media phenomenon, with presenters
from its MTV channel receiving rock star receptions, and at least 3.3m
households receiving its programmes.
Mr Kirk Sweeney, research director at Lehman Brothers, argued: 'China may
put a twinkle in his eye, but I don't think Rupert Murdoch is paying
USDollars 525m for China today, or China tomorrow. He is paying for global
distribution for his product.'
However the hidden value in the Star equation is definitely China. Mr
Murdoch has made no secret of his ambition to break into this market of
1.2bn consumers, with their decades of accumulated savings.
Although direct satellite link-up is illegal for individuals, an estimated
500,000 dishes were sold in China last year, and there is no evidence of
moves to enforce the law. As technology advances, and dishes get smaller, it
is going to become increasingly difficult for governments to block Star's
reach.
Mr John Ure, research associate at the Centre for Asian Studies, said: 'I
think China will try to follow the Singapore model of developing its own
cable network, thereby enabling it to control what goes on the screens.'
There are already more than 1,000 licensed cable television networks
operating in China. Wharf Cable - the cable operating subsidiary of the
former Sir Yue-Kong Pao's Wharf group - recently became the first foreign
company to gain a licence to operate a Chinese cable network, in the city of
Chengdu.
According to Star's latest internal forecasts, it expects to reach 14m
Chinese households by the end of this year, and 21m by the end of 1994. This
compares with the current figure of 4.8m.
However, the Chinese audience is going to want to watch Chinese programmes,
and this is News Corp's one weak link.
News Corp was blocked by Hong Kong regulators from purchasing 22 per cent of
TVB, the Hong Kong terrestrial broadcaster which controls an estimated 60
per cent of all Chinese language programmes outside China.
TVB has just announced the formation of a consortium including CNN
International, ESPN Asia, Home Box Office Asia and government-owned
Australian broadcaster ATVI, which is to lease 16 transponders on the APT
satellite, due for launch in June 1994. TVB sees Taiwan and, eventually,
China as the vital markets. Further competition is inevitable.
Mr Fung Shong-kwong, general manager of TVB International, said: 'I don't
need computer models to project how we will do because we have been selling
our programming to China on video and to TV stations for 15 years, very
profitably.'
With a satellite transmission that will cover all of China and Taiwan, TVB
can offer the same distribution, but more attractive programming.
Mr Fung said it was unlikely TVB would sign a programming deal with its
erstwhile ally. Some analysts, however, believe News Corp could sell 12 per
cent of its stake in Star, thereby retaining 51 per cent control and reeling
TVB's library through the offer of equity participation.
As an alternative, or possible addition, Star is already negotiating to
purchase the entire library of Hong Kong film-maker Golden Harvest, which
has around 350 titles.
More than just China is at stake. The overseas Chinese control the business
wealth of Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan and the bulk of the south-east Asian
economies. If Mr Murdoch can attract their hearts, he will definitely have a
prize worth winning.

FT  03 AUG 93 / International Company News: Star chief expected to resign
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Julian Mounter, chief executive of Star TV, the Asian satellite venture,
is expected to announce his resignation tomorrow.
The move comes a week after Mr Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation bought a
majority stake in the company, which broadcasts five channels of television
to 38 countries. The cash and shares deal was worth around Dollars 525m.
His resignation will come as a surprise after appearing last week to be
looking forward to working with the new owners of Star TV. A meeting with Mr
Murdoch was expected in Los Angeles this week.
News Corporation said it would be interested in maintaining some
relationship with Mr Mounter, whose experience ranges from working for The
Times newspaper and Thames Television in the UK.
He was also director-general of the New Zealand Broadcasting Corporation. He
then took a year off to sail the world before becoming chief executive of
Star last September.
He was involved in the negotiations which pitted Pearson, owners of the
Financial Times, against News Corp for a majority stake in Star.

SHARES in Daf, the Dutch truckmaker which collapsed under the weight of its
debts in early 1993, are to be delisted from the Amsterdam stock exchange on
September 1, with official trading to end on August 31, the bourse said
yesterday.
The move follows repeated assertions from the receivers that shareholders
could not expect to receive anything for their shares, which are now quoted
at just Fl 0.45, compared with their flotation price of Fl 47 per share in
mid-1989.
Daf was resurrected in slimmed-down form as Daf Trucks in March.
The company is held privately by shareholders who include the Dutch state,
the Flemish regional government of Belgium, and a number of institutional
shareholders.
The decision to halt trading means that the expiration date of October call
and put options on Amsterdam's European options exchange will also be
brought forward to August 31.
However, Daf's 1988 6 3/4 per cent bonds will continue to be traded on the
bourse on an over-the-counter basis.
A group of bondholders has said it will undertake legal action to press for
damages against the issue's lead-manager, ABN Amro Bank, and the trustee.
The bonds, with a nominal value of Fl 1,000, have recently been quoted at
around Fl 25.

<TEXT>
LION NATHAN, the New Zealand-based brewing and soft drinks group, is set to
lift its share of the Australian beer market from 40 to 46 per cent after
buying the brewery operations of South Australian Brewing Holdings.
If approved, the takeover will consolidate Lion Nathan's position as the
biggest brewer in Australia and New Zealand. SA Brewing's main brands are
Southwark, West End and Eagle. Lion Nathan yesterday said it was paying
ADollars 225m (USDollars 152m) in cash for SA's brewing division, including
the modern Southwark Brewing and Kent Town Malting, plus 105 hotels in the
state of South Australia.
In addition, it has agreed a long-term contract for SA Brewing to continue
to supply aluminium cans for SA brewing products, and later this year for
Pepsi-Cola bottlers in New Zealand.
On expiry of the existing contract, SA Brewing will have the right to supply
Lion Nathan's other aluminium can requirements in Australia and New Zealand,
provided it can match competitive pricing.
Lion Nathan recently raised funds to retire debt and to help finance the
purchase of the brewing interests.
It said the purchase would underpin its hopes to increase its share of the
South Australian market and the overall Australian beer industry.
Lion Nathan said it had not yet decided whether to retain the hotels, noting
that it did not own many in Australia and was selling them in New Zealand.
The purchase of the assets would increase Lion Nathan's assets in Australia
to over 75 per cent of its total assets.

<TEXT>
WESTPAC Banking of Australia is to sell its Ord Minnett broking arm to
Jardine Fleming Australia and Ord Minnett management, Reuter reports from
Sydney.
No price was disclosed, but Westpac said Ord Minnett management and Jardine
Fleming would each take a 50 per cent stake in Ord Minnett, and the deal
would be closed by September 30.
Hong Kong-based Jardine Fleming is owned by Jardine Matheson Holdings and
UK-based Robert Fleming, with 50 per cent each.
The buyers claim the company will benefit from the combination of Ord
Minnett's strong domestic presence and Jardine Fleming's cross-border
expertise and international network.
Mr Robert Joss, Westpac managing director, said the sale was in line with
Westpac's strategy of disposing of non-core assets.
Mr Neville Miles, joint managing director of Ord Minnett Securities, said
the group would focus on its underwriting business and derivative markets in
Asia in the new joint venture. He said Ord Minnett had not yet finalised an
arrangement to offer management and staff a stake in the broking firm.

FT  03 AUG 93 / International Company News: Elf-Aquitaine expected to
replace chief this week
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR LOIK Le Floch-Prigent, chairman of Elf-Aquitaine, the state-controlled
oil and gas company which is France's largest industrial group, will be
replaced this week, official sources said yesterday.
Mr Philippe Jaffre, chairman of Credit Agricole, one of France's most
powerful financial institutions, is expected to be voted on to the Elf board
today and confirmed as chairman by the government council of ministers
tomorrow.
The move largely reflects political motives. Mr Le Floch-Prigent was
appointed head of Elf by the socialist President Francois Mitterrand in
1989. He has been regarded as vulnerable since the centre-right government
of Mr Edouard Balladur took office in March.
The government is keen to remove a socialist appointee from the head of Elf
because the oil group has been named among the first four companies to be
sold as part of the government's privatisation programme.
The move reflects the practice of replacing the heads of important
state-owned companies following a shift in political power between the left
and the right. So far, however, the government of Mr Balladur has been
restrained in replacing company chiefs. The only other change has been the
replacement of Mr Rene Thomas as head of Banque Nationale de Paris by Mr
Michel Pebereau in May.
The relatively conciliatory approach of the Balladur government is reflected
in the fact that Mr Le Floch-Prigent is expected to be given another
important post.
Official sources said that he would probably take control of Gaz de France,
the state-owned utility.
Mr Jaffre has no previous experience of managing an industrial company. He
worked in the French treasury between 1977 and 1987, and for Mr Rene Monori,
then economy minister, in 1979 and 1980. He was executive chairman at Banque
Stern and was appointed chairman of Credit Agricole in 1988.
A government official said that Mr Jaffre had been selected because of his
management expertise and because the Elf privatisation would be a complex
financial challenge.
The government has indicated that the size of the group - it has an
estimated market value of about FFr100bn (Dollars 16.8bn) - might mean that
it is privatised in tranches.
The government currently holds 51.4 per cent of the shares.

FT  03 AUG 93 / International Company News: CMB warns of fall in first-half
profits

<TEXT>
CARNAUDMETALBOX, the Anglo-French packaging group, yesterday warned of a
fall in net profits for the first half of this year due to adverse exchange
rates and difficult market conditions.
CMB, which is the leading player in European packaging, said that sales fell
by 6 per cent to FFr11.89bn (Dollars 2bn) in the first half of this year,
down from FFr12.63bn.
Interim profits were likely to fall at a similar rate. This would bring the
net figure down to around FFr518m from FFr549m.
The profits warning follows a reshuffle among CMB's shareholders.
MB-Caradon, the UK building products group, this spring sold its 25.3 per
cent stake in CMB for FFr3.91bn to a consortium of existing investors. The
consortium included CGIP, the French holding company, which increased its
initial 25.3 per cent holding in CMB by 7 per cent.
CMB said trading had been difficult throughout the first half with a
deterioration in performance in Spain and Germany during the second quarter.
The only European market to show signs of improvement in the second quarter
was the UK.
CMB yesterday said that conditions had improved in Asia, Africa and the US,
but there was no sign of recovery in Europe.
The group has also been badly affected by changes in exchange rates since
the September currency crisis. It estimated that currency movements
depressed its sales by 7.5 per cent in the first half, although it did
receive a 3.4 per cent boost from acquisitions.
The prospect of a weaker franc following this weekend's crisis reform of the
ERM should alleviate the currency problem.
Last year, CMB reported a 15 per cent increase in net profits to FFr976m on
turnover of FFr24.83bn.

FT  03 AUG 93 / International Company News: A summer under wraps at BNP -
Pebereau plots a course for privatisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AUGUST is traditionally a time for French executives to rest, but for Mr
Michel Pebereau, the new chairman of Banque Nationale de Paris, it will be a
demanding month when he must map out a new strategy for the bank in
preparation for its privatisation next autumn.
Mr Pebereau, who was brought into BNP two months ago by France's new
centre-right government to replace the veteran Mr Rene Thomas, will in early
September present his plans for the future of the traditional bastion of
French banking - first to its staff and then the investment community.
The scale of Mr Pebereau's challenge at BNP should not be underestimated. He
has taken over at an extraordinarily sensitive time when BNP is not only
poised for sale to the private sector, but is also badly bruised by the
recession that has for the past year haunted France's banks.
The new chairman does have the advantage of being an old hand at the
privatisation game. He arrived at BNP after a decade at Credit Commercial de
France, a smaller banking group which was privatised by the last
centre-right government in 1987.
Mr Pebereau impressed analysts and investors at CCF by creating a clearly
defined niche for his group in the sprawling French banking scene. He
focused on four areas of activity - retail banking, investment banking,
asset management and private banking - and positioned it as the bank for
wealthy private clients. He invested in an ambitious arts sponsorship
programme and even commissioned Mr Sebastio Salgado, the celebrated
Brazilian photographer, to work on last year's annual report.
His task at BNP will be very different. Mr Pebereau has moved from a
middle-sized bank which made net income of FFr7.9bn in 1992 to one of the
biggest banks in Europe with net income of FFr39.92bn (Dollars 6.77bn).
Moreover, BNP reported a reduction in net profits from FFr2.94bn in 1991 to
FFr2.17bn in 1992 and recently warned of a further fall in the first half of
1993.
BNP, in common with the other big French banks, has been affected by the
sluggish state of the credit market and the steep increase in business
failures, particularly among smaller companies. Ms Susan Sternglass, banking
analyst at Goldman Sachs, is braced for a further fall in net profits this
year to FFr1.1bn.
At first glance, this does not look like an attractive privatisation
prospect. However, Mr Pebereau does have consolation that BNP is not heavily
exposed to large corporate loans, unlike Credit Lyonnais, the other big
state bank. As a result, Ms Sternglass and other analysts are confident
that, once the French economy recovers, BNP's problems should ease.
'This is a straightforward recovery story,' said Ms Sheila Garrard, banking
analyst at Shearson Lehman. 'We should see an improvement next year with the
real recovery coming through in 1995. In the meantime, Mr Pebereau will have
a chance to show us what he can do.'
One area where Mr Pebereau should be able to make an impact is in costs.
BNP's costs represented 70.4 per cent of income last year, which is typical
of the big French banks but higher than the German average of 65 per cent or
the British of 55 per cent.
French banks have traditionally shied away from rationalisation because
stiff labour laws have made it so costly and complex to shed staff.
Rationalisation is now slightly easier due to recent changes in legislation
and BNP, like the other banks, has already announced a cost-cutting plan.
Analysts suspect Mr Pebereau might accelerate that programme, possibly as
part of a longer term effort to streamline BNP's organisational structure.
On the strategic front, he has to consider what to do with the portfolio of
industrial investments that BNP has built up in other state-controlled
companies. Judging by his record at CCF, he is unlikely to follow Mr
Jean-Yves Haberer, his counterpart at Credit Lyonnais, by beefing up BNP's
industrial banking role. But most of the existing investments are long-term
stakes which he may decide to keep.
The other big issue is the future of BNP's relationship with Dresdner Bank
of Germany. The two banks already collaborate in eastern Europe and have
agreed terms for a share-swap of up to 10 per cent. Mr Pebereau must decide
whether to extend the collaboration into other countries and how to
structure BNP's operations outside France.
'Mr Pebereau was a great success at CCF and we have high hopes of him at
BNP,' said one analyst. 'But BNP is much more complex than CCF and he has a
bigger job to do. We'll really see what he is made of now.'

FT  03 AUG 93 / International Company News: Fondiaria's L1,058bn rights
issue wins shareholder approval
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FONDIARIA, Italy's third-biggest private-sector insurance group, which
suffered a L578bn loss last year, yesterday won shareholder approval for a
L1,058bn (Dollars 658.4m) rights issue.
However, Gaic, the listed holding company which controls Fondiaria,
surprised shareholders by announcing it would partly subscribe to the issue.
As a result, the stake held by Gaic, which is jointly controlled by the
heavily-indebted Ferruzzi group and the heirs of Mr Camillo De Benedetti,
will fall to about 34 per cent from 51 per cent.
Minority shareholders in both Fondiaria and Gaic have complained that the
rights issue, announced soon after the scale of Ferruzzi's financial
problems became apparent, would have meant that control of Fondiaria would
have passed to Ferruzzi's five main creditor banks.
Under the terms of the offer, the banks, led by Mediobanca, are fully
underwriting the rights issue.
In an attempt to diffuse minority shareholders' wrath and potential
conflicts with Milan magistrates monitoring the Ferruzzi rescue, Gaic has
decided to sell the rights to about half the new shares to which it is
entitled, using the proceeds to finance the purchase of the remainder. The
underwriting banks have indicated to Gaic that the rights will be worth a
maximum L16,000 a share
Fondiaria's proposed rights issue, approved by shareholders in Florence
yesterday, involves issuing two new shares at L6,500 each for every share
currently held. Fondiaria shares were trading at almost L27,000 before the
issue was announced.
The decision could mean Gaic will remain the biggest single shareholder in
Fondiaria: had it not subscribed to any new shares, its stake in Fondiaria
would have dropped to about 17 per cent. However, the precise ranking of
shareholders will depend partly on how many minority shareholders take up
their rights. At present, Mediobanca has about 15 per cent of Fondiaria,
while Generali, Italy's biggest insurer, with which it is closely
associated, has about 7 per cent.
Fondiaria will use the proceeds to recapitalise its La Fondiaria, Milano and
La Previdente subsidiaries. Some of the money will also go to cutting group
debts of L2,368bn at the end of June.
Fondiaria's financial difficulties stem from its heavy spending to buy into
Aachener und Munchener Beteiligungs, Germany's second-biggest insurer, as
well as ambitious European expansion plans with AMB and Royal Insurance of
the UK. Fondiaria also embarked on an expensive and unsuccessful
diversifications in its domestic market, financing largely through debt.

FT  03 AUG 93 / International Company News: Gucci chairman admits to
pledging shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER and HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Maurizio Gucci, chairman of the fashion house which carries his name, has
admitted to pledging 10 per cent of his shares in the Gucci business to
secure personal debts.
The latest twist in the battle for control of the company, made in a court
filing in New York, came days after Mr Gucci publicly denied having pledged
shares.
Investcorp, the Bahrain-based bank which holds 50 per cent of Gucci, is
seeking to force Mr Gucci's dismissal and win control of his 50 per cent
through the New York courts. The bank alleges Mr Gucci has violated a
shareholder agreement by pledging his shares. Mr Gucci denies this
interpretation of the agreement.
In a New York court yesterday, a judge ruled that Mr Gucci's shares, which
have been subject to a restraining order since July 22, should be frozen for
a further week. The court is expected to decide on Friday whether the stake
should restrained pending the outcome of arbitration launched by Investcorp
last month.
Mr Gucci has consistently denied pledging any of his shares to third
parties.
A Gucci spokesman suggested the apparent contradiction might be due to a
technicality. He suggested that Mr Gucci had denied pledging 'Gucci' shares,
rather than commenting on shares in Seaton Hills, the offshore holding
company which owns Mr Gucci's stake.
Last night, Gucci officials were also trying to ascertain from lawyers
whether pledging 10 per cent would be enough to infringe the pact with
Investcorp.
Yesterday's admission follows an earlier setback for Mr Gucci. On Saturday,
a Milan judge rejected his attempt to sequester Investcorp assets in Italy.
The decision was based on the fact that the court could not consider an
action by Mr Gucci regarding Guccio Gucci, the group's Italian parent
company, as he is not a direct shareholder.

FT  03 AUG 93 / ERM crisis vindicates UK monetary policy, says Major
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MAASTRICHT timetable for European monetary union is now 'totally
unrealistic', Mr John Major said yesterday, as he claimed that the emergency
steps taken to salvage the exchange rate mechanism vindicated his decision
to suspend sterling's membership last September.
As government loyalists and Euro-sceptics alike sought to draw comfort from
the day's events, which also saw Britain become the eleventh European
Community state to ratify Maastricht, the prime minister said he hoped the
decision to allow wider fluctuation of currencies within the ERM would
promote economic recovery in Europe.
In the timetable, if a commencement date for stage three of monetary union
has not been set by the end of 1997, then Emu must in any case go ahead by
January 1999.
In a remark later played down by Downing Street, Mr Major appeared to hold
out the prospect that the changes could herald lower domestic interest
rates.
There remained 'no prospect' of Britain returning to the ERM 'in the near
future', he said. The government would continue to set monetary policy by
'what's right for the United Kingdom'.
But as senior ministers trumpeted the message that recent developments
justified the government's European policy, their thunder was partly stolen
by Mr Norman Lamont, the former chancellor, who predicted there would be no
single European currency and described Maastricht as 'a bit of a fossil'.
Tory Euro-sceptics, meanwhile, pointed to the 'supreme irony' of Britain
ratifying Maastricht on the day the ERM collapsed.
Downing Street emphasised that 'relative currency stability' remained a
desirable objective and looked ahead to a process of examining why the old
system did not work and how existing fault-lines could be eradicated.
It pinned the blame for the system's difficulties squarely on the strains
resulting from German reunification. It indicated that an autumn summit of
member states to discuss possible solutions was likely.
In his forthright reaction to the decision to create a 15 per cent
fluctuation band for all ERM currencies except the D-Mark and the guilder,
Mr Lamont said: 'This does mean the end of a single currency, the end of
monetary union in Europe. This makes the Maastricht treaty redundant.'
It was 'extraordinary that we have spent so much time constructing this
artificial creation and, frankly, it has gone out of the window', he said.

FT  03 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Govett to acquire US trust for Dollars 3.8m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GOVETT &amp; Company, the fund management group, has agreed to buy the North
American Trust Company for Dollars 3.8m (Pounds 2.55m) from the Bank of San
Diego.
The trust company provides pension trust services to law firms and medical
services groups in the US and currently administers some Dollars 1.4bn of
assets. Govett already has a Jersey-based trust company, London Pacific.
Mr Ian Whitehead, chief financial officer, said the purchase gave Govett the
administrative and operating capability to manage trust accounts for high
net worth individuals, and allowed it the chance to cross-sell its
investment management services. Trust companies are a source of high quality
earnings, he said.
The agreement is subject to regulatory approval which is expected to be
granted within six to eight weeks.

FT  03 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Oceonics declines to Pounds 2m and seeks
Pounds 4.35m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
OCEONICS GROUP, a provider of survey and positioning services, reported
pre-tax profits down from Pounds 2.72m to Pounds 2.04m from revenues up 4
per cent Pounds 30.1m in the year to end-March.
The company also announced plans to raise Pounds 4.35m by a placing and open
offer of redeemable preference shares and the redemption of existing
preference shares.
Operating profit was Pounds 2.2m (Pounds 3.2m) after depreciation of Pounds
2.6m (Pounds 2.3m) and a charge of Pounds 141,000 in respect of exceptional
losses on foreign currency overdrafts which were repaid during the year.
Net interest payable fell to Pounds 196,000 (Pounds 489,000) and tax took
Pounds 843,000 (Pounds 864,000). This year's charge included Pounds 116,000
relating to prior years, principally to profits of overseas subsidiaries,
some of which could not be offset against losses brought forward in other
subsidiaries.
After an extraordinary charge of Pounds 426,000 retained profits were Pounds
724,000 (Pounds 1.75m). Earnings per share were 0.6p (1.2p).
The company is to issue 4.63m 6 per cent cumulative convertible redeemable
preference shares. All of the new preference shares have been placed with
institutional investors at par.
Existing holders can apply on the basis of one preference share for every 30
ordinary held.
The placing is conditional on approval by holders of existing 9.25 per cent
preference shares for their redemption at par plus payment of arrears and
accruals of dividend in full.
In addition payment of a special dividend of 1p per existing preference
share is proposed.
Most of the placing proceeds will be used to redeem the existing preference
shares. The balance of some Pounds 853,000 will provide additional working
capital.

The split capital Scottish National Trust had a net asset value of 67.3p per
capital share at June 30.
The figure marked a sharp recovery from the value of 21.9p a year earlier
and just 2.8p at the trust's September year-end.
Net revenue for the nine months to end-June declined to Pounds 9.24m (Pounds
11.32m), equivalent to earnings of 5.11p (6.44p) per income share. A third
interim dividend of 1.8p reduces the total so far to 4.9p (5.8p).

FT  03 AUG 93 / UK Company News: McInerney suspended at 9p
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES IN McInerney Properties, the Dublin-based construction company, were
suspended on the London Stock Exchange at 9p yesterday, pending
clarification of its financial position.
As revealed last month, the company is in talks with certain non-bank
creditors regarding a rescheduling of repayments due on sums amounting to
some IPounds 1.43m (Pounds 1.35m).
The discussions, the company said, had taken longer than originally
anticipated, although some progress had been made. However, one creditor,
whose debt amounts to IPounds 250,000, had taken action against McInerney in
the UK courts.
Depending on the outcome of the talks, the preliminary results could be
materially altered, and the future of the company remained uncertain,
directors said.

FT  03 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Weir expands with Pounds 16m of
acquisitions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER and DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WEIR GROUP, the Glasgow-based engineering company, is paying about Pounds
16m for a package of UK, US and Australian businesses.
The companies being acquired are owned by Darchem, the wholly owned
subsidiary of William Baird, one of Britain's biggest clothing
manufacturers.
The deal is Weir's second biggest acquisition to date after the Pounds 30m
it paid in 1990 for Strachan &amp; Henshaw, the mechanical handling specialist.
It continues the group's strategy of focusing on specialist engineering
products and services worldwide.
For William Baird, also based in Glasgow, the sale is its second in eight
months of non-core businesses. The company said yesterday it planned to make
further disposals to concentrate on clothing, textiles and distribution.
Weir has bought Darchem Engineering, Hoyt Darchem, Expert Heat Treatments,
The Hoyt Metal Company of Australia and Darchem Engineering of California.
These make a range of products including insulation systems, fabricated
components, specialist anti-friction alloys and white metal bearings, as
well as providing heat treatment services. The companies have annual sales
of about Pounds 28m and made pre-tax profits last year of Pounds 2.9m.
Mr Ron Garrick, Weir's managing director and chief executive, said the
Darchem businesses would complement and broaden Weir's product range and
offer new business opportunities.
Weir, best known for its pumps, has spent about Pounds 120m on 23
acquisitions in the past six years, and sold nine businesses worth nearly
Pounds 40m in the same period.
The Pounds 16m price tag compares with Pounds 8m of adjusted end-1992 net
assets for the businesses Weir is buying.
Mr John Dean, analyst at Albert E Sharp, the Birmingham-based broker, said:
'It is not like Weir to pay significantly over net assets, and this reflects
well on the profitability of the Darchem businesses.'
Weir said the acquisitions would make a positive contribution to earnings.
The group earned 35.5p per share last year on turnover of Pounds 424.8m and
pre-tax profits of Pounds 39.2m.
William Baird's Darchem subsidiary is its umbrella company for non-textiles
and clothing businesses. Last December, William Baird sold most of Darchem's
contracting side to Cape, the industrial services and building products
group controlled by Charter.
It still owns the building services division of Darchem as well as several
small companies in motor components that it was unable to sell to Weir or
Cape.
The Pounds 16m from the Weir deal will initially add to the company's cash
pile, which stood at Pounds 2m at the end of the last financial year.
'The cash released from the disposal of these businesses will be invested in
the group's principal activity in clothing and textiles,' said Mr Donald
Parr, chairman.

FT  03 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Sibelco extends hostile bid for Watts Blake
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIBELCO has extended its hostile Pounds 87m offer for Watts Blake Bearne,
the world's biggest supplier of ball clay.
The private Belgian group, which produces silica sand for the glass
industry, said it had received acceptances representing 0.6 per cent of
Watts' shares, bringing the total controlled or owned to 45.7 per cent.
Sibelco was now seeking control, an adviser said, although previously the
group had said Stock Exchange requirements to make an offer once a holding
had gone above 30 per cent was the impetus for its bid.
If the Belgian company does not win control, it may buy up to 1 per cent a
year without making a second offer. Sibelco was determined to hold on to its
investment, an adviser said.
Watts yesterday welcomed the small number of acceptances as proof that the
bid undervalued the company. It added that it regretted 'the further period
of uncertainty' the extension would cause.
Watts has been on the block since January when three shareholders, including
Sibelco, decided to sell their stakes, totalling 45.2 per cent.
When no buyer was found, Sibelco launched its own bid at 420p a share in
June. Ceramics Holdings, with 15.6 per cent, accepted the bid, while
Quarzwerke of Germany, with 14.8 per cent, agreed to act in concert with
Sibelco.

FT  03 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Group 4 to concentrate on guarding
businesses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GROUP 4, the private security company, is to sell its cash-in-transit
business to the UK arm of Mayne Nickless, the Australian-quoted security
company.
In return, Group 4 will acquire Security Express Guards, Mayne Nickless's
guarding business, which employs about 2,000 people. Group 4 will also
receive a substantial cash payment.
Mr Jim Harrower, UK chief executive of Group 4, said pressure from the banks
meant the cash-in-transit business offered low profit margins and his group
had decided to focus on guarding.
The cash-handling business being sold by Group 4 employs 1,200 people, with
annual revenue of Pounds 25m. Together with its existing cash-in-transit
businesses, Security Express and Armaguard, this deal means Mayne Nickless
will dominate the cash-in-transit market and should be able to achieve
better profit margins.
Security Express Guards will be merged with Group 4 Total Security to become
the biggest provider of manned guarding services in the UK.
Discussions have been held with the Office of Fair Trading and both
companies believe the arrangement will not be referred to the Monopolies and
Mergers Commission.
Before this deal, which will boost revenue by Pounds 23m, Group 4 Total
Security had annual sales of about Pounds 82m, and employed 5,000 people.

Amstrad is hoping to lift sales of its satellite receiving equipment in the
Asia Pacific and Middle East regions following a distribution agreement with
Pan Asian Systems, a subsidiary of Hutchison Whampoa.
Nearly a third of Amstrad's turnover comes from satellite equipment.
Hutchison is one of the largest distributors of satellite receiving
equipment in the two regions.
Amstrad will market its equipment as able to receive broadcasts from Star
TV, the Hong Kong-based satellite television broadcaster, in which a 63.6
per cent stake was acquired last week by News International.

FT  03 AUG 93 / UK Company News: New drink tastes force take-home changes -
A look at the background to Bass's sale of Augustus Barnett to Allied-Lyons
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BASS's impending sale to Allied-Lyons of its Augustus Barnett off-licence
chain continues the consolidation of specialist retailers in the face of
aggressive competition from the multiple grocers in the take-home drinks
market.
The deal, worth an estimated Pounds 40m, will enlarge Allied's Victoria Wine
business, giving it about 1,500 shops throughout the country and closing the
gap on Whitbread, the market leader.
Whitbread bought the Peter Dominic chain from Grand Metropolitan for Pounds
49.5m nearly two years ago to boost its Thresher retail operation to about
1,600 outlets.
In 1991, Greenalls Group also increased its Cellar 5 off-licences to nearly
500 with the acquisition of Blayneys from Vaux, the north-east England
brewer.
The moves are a response to growing changes in British drinking habits.
An increasing amount of alcohol is being drunk at home, rather than in pubs
or restaurants - more wine with meals, more beer by the television set, more
whisky nightcaps.
In the 1960s only 2 per cent of beer was drunk at home. Ten years ago the
proportion had grown to 10 per cent. Today it is more than 20 per cent.
The take-home trend has been accelerated by recession with consumers seeking
better value by staying at home with a six-pack instead of having a night on
the town.
But many other forces are driving the development, including the
drink-driving laws, an ageing population and more home entertainment
facilities.
A growing taste for wine, which now accounts for 20 per cent of UK alcohol
sales compared with 9 per cent in 1965, has contributed to the trend. So has
the swing to imported bottled lagers and the improvements made by brewers to
canned ales and stout.
'New experiences in drinking are very much in vogue,' says Verdict, the
retail analyst, and the take-home trade has proved adept at encouraging and
satisfying the demand for variety.
As a result, take-home is one of the fastest growing sectors of the drinks
market, worth an estimated Pounds 6.1bn, about 25 per cent of the total
spent on drinks last year.
With wine sales amounting to Pounds 2.12bn, spirits to Pounds 2.04bn, and
beer to Pounds 1.73bn, according to Verdict, drinks form one of the largest
areas of consumer spending and the fight for a share is fierce.
The grocery trade claims 55 per cent of the overall market with eight
supermarket chains - J Sainsbury, Tesco, Argyll, Asda, Gateway, Kwik Save,
Waitrose and Morrison - accounting for 43 per cent.
The chains have been steadily enlarging their share by tight control of
costs and prices, greater allocation of shelf space and an expanding range
of products.
Sunday opening and extended evening trading have recently added to their
competitive edge.
Tesco illustrated the focus on price a few weeks ago by importing cheap
Stella Artois lager through its French subsidiary rather than buying from
Whitbread, which brews it under licence in the UK.
But the sheer range, and increasingly skilful choice, of the supermarkets'
offerings have been equally important in growing sales.
In the past four years, according to Verdict, Tesco has more than doubled
the shelf space devoted to drinks in its stores. It has raised the number of
different wines from 370 to 650. Its complement of 100 beers is the most
comprehensive in the market.
Sainsbury offers almost as many beers and last year featured 400 wines, with
a greater emphasis on vintage products.
These two supermarket groups, each with market shares of more than 9 per
cent, have headed the apparently irresistible advance of the grocers.
Specialist off-licences, in many cases established by brewers primarily as
outlets for their own products, were slow to respond. But they are now
mounting a more robust resistance.
The Thresher/Peter Dominic merger has given Whitbread national coverage and
market leadership with a 10 per cent share, enabling it to match the
purchasing power of the multiples.
Allied-Lyons should gain similar advantages from combining its Victoria Wine
business, where sales grew by 6 per cent last year, with Augustus Barnett.
Greenalls' retail strength in north-west England has been complemented in
the north-east by the acquisition of Blayneys.
Oddbins, owned by Seagram, the Canadian drinks group, has compensated for
its lack of scale - it has about 175 stores - by carving out a niche as the
country's leading wine merchant. It sells 1,650 different wines with an
off-beat, but knowledgeable, approach to marketing which appeals equally to
young consumers and serious wine buffs.
Unwins, a family-owned chain of 294 shops, which this year celebrates its
150th anniversary, has survived by a gradual move up-market.
The specialist retailers are fighting back by stronger merchandising and a
greater emphasis on personal service, including items such as customer
advice and home delivery.
They are using local consumer research to segment their stores, matching
their stocks, which in some areas now include convenience foods, more
closely to neighbourhood demands.
Most of the bigger groups have also invested in computerised information
systems, following the multiple grocers in gaining more immediate sales data
and tighter stock control.
The top half dozen specialists, with 63 per cent of off-licence sales and a
24.3 per cent share of total take-home sales, are now better equipped for
the battle against the multiples.
For the smaller, independent retailer caught between the two forces, the
future looks bleak.

Shares in Spring Ram rose 15p to 69p yesterday after it confirmed that talks

The Yorkshire-based company named one of the parties, Masco Corporation, a
large US building products group, but said the approaches were of a
preliminary nature, and it was unlikely that any decision would be made for
some time.
Mr Roger Regan, who last week took over as chairman of Spring Ram, said he

FT  03 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Pounds 3m offer for loss-making Etonbrook
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR ALEX Perloff, the erstwhile rebel shareholder of Etonbrook Properties who
staged a boardroom coup and took the chair himself, yesterday announced that
companies in which he has interests had agreed a cash offer for Etonbrook.
The two investment companies, Panther and Multitrust, already own 1.26m
shares - some 32.9 per cent of the shares or 25.8 per cent of voting rights.
They are offering 79p per share, a premium of 1.3 per cent over the 78p
closing price on July 29, valuing the company at about Pounds 3.03m.
Etonbrook yesterday reported pre-tax losses of Pounds 1.23m in the year to
March 31 compared with profits of Pounds 181,214. It showed net current
assets of about Pounds 4.4m (Pounds 5.99m).
Losses per share were 34.3p compared with profits of 1.3p last time. There
is no dividend.
The new board has decided not to compensate the company's former directors
and has made a provision towards costs that could arise from legal claims.
Directors intend to investigate the original acquisition of properties from
Palmerston Investment Trust, in particular a property bought for Pounds 3.5m
in 1989 now valued at Pounds 250,000.

165,000 pay-off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHITECROFT, the Cheshire-based mini-conglomerate which reported a Pounds
41.8m pre-tax loss in the year to March 31, paid a total of Pounds 165,000
in compensation for loss of office to two former directors.
The payments were made to Mr Peter Goold, former chairman, and Mr Graham
M'Cardell, finance director, and were disclosed in the company's annual
report. The total payment was not broken down between the two men.
Mr M'Cardell retired from the board in early March after reaching normal
retirement age, while Mr Goold resigned later that month after 24 years with
the company, the last two as executive chairman.
Mr Goold's resignation was seen as an attempt to appease the group's
institutional investors, who had watched the share price tumble.
He was succeeded in a non-executive capacity by Mr David Kendall, chairman
of Bunzl. Mr Mike Derbyshire - brought in by Mr Goold as managing director
last year - became chief executive, and Mr M'Cardell was succeeded by Mr
Martyn Ellis.

FT  03 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Scheme for LUI subsidiaries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PROVISIONAL liquidators of the insurance subsidiaries of London United
Investments are expected to publish a scheme of arrangement before the end
of this month.
LUI, the insurance to property conglomerate, collapsed early in 1990.
Its subsidiaries, Kingscroft Insurance, Walbrook Insurance, El Paso
Insurance, Lime Street Insurance and Mutual Reinsurance - collectively
referred to as the KWELM companies - have outstanding liabilities to
policyholders amounting to some Dollars 5bn (Pounds 3.3bn).
The business underwritten by the KWELM companies consisted mainly of general
and product liability insurance for North American companies, together with
pro-fessional indemnity insurance for accountants, architects, engineers and
lawyers, and medical malpractice ins-rance for doctors and hos-pitals.
Most of the business was written through HS Weavers (Underwriting) Agencies
between 1972 and 1990.
Mr Chris Hughes and Mr Ian Bond, both partners in Coopers &amp; Lybrand, will
seek creditors' approval for a scheme of arrangement rather than a straight
liquidation.
They believe a scheme of arrangement offers the best prospects for the
100,000 plus actual or potential creditors of the companies.
The provisional liquidators have recovered or secured more than Dollars 280m
since their appointment.
They are attempting to recover further insurance assets from more than 600
reinsurers worldwide.

<TEXT>
ASHTEAD, the plant and machinery hire group, reported a 22 per cent increase
in annual profits and said that current trading was 'well up on the same
period last year and margins are now strengthening.'
Pre-tax profits increased to Pounds 2.76m in the year to April 30 against
Pounds 2.27m last time when profits were reduced by a Pounds 65,000
exceptional charge.
Of the Pounds 489,000 increase, Pounds 386,000 came in the second half and
Mr Peter Lewis, chairman, said the stronger second half performance had
continued into the current year.
Turnover increased by 10 per cent to Pounds 33.9m (Pounds 30.8m) with all
three divisions achieving increased sales and rental income now accounting
for 89 per cent of the total.
Earnings per share rose 35 per cent to 9.7p (7.2p); an increased final
dividend of 3.405p makes a total of 4.538p (4.125p).
Mr Lewis said: 'The results reflect the strategy we have been pursuing since
1990. We have maintained investment, reshaped our customer base and entered
new markets. As a consequence, and almost entirely through organic growth,
we have increased our market share and strengthened the position of each of
our businesses.'
Total capital expenditure increased to Pounds 10.5m (Pounds 7.8m), including
Pounds 8.8m on plant, comfortably exceeding the depreciation charge of
Pounds 7.93m (Pounds 7.46m). Reflecting the high level of capital
expenditure net borrowings increased to Pounds 10.3m (Pounds 8.4m) at the
end of April, equivalent to gearing of 50 per cent, up from 43 per cent a
year earlier.
A-Plant, the core plant hire division, lifted turnover by some 7 per cent to
Pounds 26.9m, further increased its market share, and reported trading
profits of Pounds 9.73m (Pounds 9.39m).
COMMENT
Ashtead's strategy through the recession should stand it in good stead now
the recovery appears to have arrived. The group has continued to invest
heavily in new plant, has reduced its dependency on construction from 80 per
cent of turnover in 1990 to less than 40 per cent today and has emphasised
industrial plant hire, rather than sales. Although the hire market has
shrunk, Ashtead has managed to boost market share and push up prices
recently. Having climbed from a low of 90p last September the shares gained
another 19p yesterday to close at 236p. With pre-tax profits of some Pounds
3.5m expected this year and earnings of 11.7p the shares are trading on a
lofty prospective p/e of about 20, but are still worth buying on signs of
weakness.

FT  03 AUG 93 / UK Company News: BBA plans to focus on four core activities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BBA, the engineering group, yesterday said it would focus on four core
businesses as it reported half year profits to the end of June.
In response to its critics, who have attacked the group for lacking
strategic consistency, Mr Vanni Treves, chairman, said the group would
concentrate on building up its automotive, industrial, aviation and
electrical businesses.
Mr Treves said: 'We are not oblivious to what the institutions have been
telling us. However, we decided to articulate the new strategy, which has
been evolving for some time, without prompting from anyone.'
Operating profits increased from Pounds 40.9m to Pounds 45.3m as the group
benefited from further cost cutting.
The automotive business, which bore the brunt of the redundancy and
reorganisation costs, saw profits fall from Pounds 17.4m to Pounds 13m.
Industrials increased profits from Pounds 17.9m to Pounds 23.7m as its
businesses continued to cut costs.
Aviation profits rose from Pounds 5.6m to Pounds 8.6m as programmes were
reduced and delivery schedules delayed because of difficulties in the
worldwide aviation market.
COMMENT
When a company seeks to reassure investors that it has no plans to ask for
more cash for the foreseeable future it is a sure sign that things are not
what they ought to be. Equity issues to fund a rapid succession of deals may
have looked attractive in the roaring 1980s, but not in the more sober
1990s. After six share issues in eight years, BBA's investors are
understandably weary of cash calls. The share price peaked in 1986 at 274p;
it yesterday fell 1p when the market rallied to close at 166p. BBA is now
talking about a new stage of consolidation which involves focusing on four
core businesses. It is a message many of the group's investors have longed
to hear, and happens to coincide with the departure of the the managing
director responsible for the empire-building. With forecast pre-tax profits
of Pounds 65m, giving earnings per share of 7.5p, the shares are on a hefty
prospective multiple of 22.1. Investors should hold on unless the company
goes back to its bad old ways of issuing more shares.

FT  03 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Midland &amp; Scottish writes off oilfield
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MIDLAND &amp; Scottish Resources has written off the entire value of its Emerald
oilfield east of Shetland after 'conversations' with its auditors.
It said the 1992 accounts, to be published shortly, had been prepared on a
going concern basis assuming the group's lenders would continue their
support for the Emerald Field project. The shares fell 3 1/2 p to 12p.
The USM-quoted oil company published results for 1992 which included a
provision of Pounds 80m (Pounds 38.9m) against the Emerald Field
development, warning that audited accounts would be delayed pending a full
assessment of a drilling programme.
The provision has been increased to Pounds 97m, deepening 1992 pre-tax
losses from Pounds 97.4m to Pounds 113.6m (Pounds 46.4m).
Production in the Emerald Field was originally delayed by a protracted
dispute over equipment with Davy Corporation, settled in May 1992.
The company said the Emerald Field would continue to provide positive cash
flow. The extent to which cash flow would service related debt depended on
the total reserves recovered from drilling new wells.
MSR said: 'Without such wells the projected production and the cash flows
based on that production are not now expected to generate a material surplus
beyond that required to meet obligations to non-banking creditors.'
It added: 'The full accounts explain that the group has received
confirmations from relevant lenders of their present intention to continue
support for the Emerald Field project which has allowed the directors to
prepare the accounts on a going concern basis.'
Directors expect any shortfall to be recovered from the floating production
platform, being built in Italy with Italian government backing, to be
delivered in 1994. The platform is now MSR's principal asset.

FT  03 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Chrysalis closes MAM Leisure after losses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHRYSALIS, the music and media group, is to wind down MAM Leisure, its
amusement machines subsidiary, and withdraw from the business.
Chrysalis expects MAM Leisure, which employs 400 people, to report a loss of
Pounds 6m in the year to end-August, following a deficit of Pounds 1.8m last
year.
Mr Chris Wright, chairman, said the business could not return to
profitability without further rationalisation and considerable investment.
The business had been badly hit by recession, but had also been adversely
affected by the fall in the number of people in the 18 to 25 age group.
The group said it expected to have withdrawn from the business by the end of
1993.
It said it was not yet clear whether all 400 employees would lose their jobs
as there was still a possibility that small parts of the business might be
sold to local operators.
Chrysalis had considered several options before deciding to close the
business.
After failing to find a buyer for the subsidiary, the group considered
withdrawing from several British regions and concentrating on the
most-densely populated parts of England. It decided, however, that this
would not solve its problems.

FT  03 AUG 93 / France mars Abbey National's gain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ABBEY National, the home loans and banking group, yesterday reported an 11
per cent rise in interim pre-tax profits to Pounds 301m, against Pounds
270m, helped by rapid growth in wholesale-funded fixed rate mortgages.
Abbey achieved a 31 per cent rise in UK retail profits to Pounds 300m
(Pounds 229m), helped by a lower bad debt charge of Pounds 118m (Pounds
146m). This reflected a fall in house repossessions and in the number of
mortgages in arrears by more than six months.
In France, the bad debt charge rose to Pounds 94m (Pounds 16m) because of
the weak commercial property market. France accounted for most of an Pounds
86m loss in continental Europe and offshore, against a Pounds 9m loss in the
first half of 1992.
The European problems drove up the overall bad debt charge, which includes
loan provisions and suspended interest, by 35 per cent to Pounds 222m
(Pounds 165m).
Abbey raised its share of new mortgage lending to 23.3 per cent of the UK
mortgage market, against 12.4 per cent, by promotion of fixed rate
mortgages. Net lending was Pounds 2bn (Pounds 1.2bn) largely funded by
wholesale funds rather than retail savings.
The group's share of UK retail savings fell from 4.1 to 3.3 per cent as
retail inflows dropped to Pounds 400m (Pounds 700m), and the percentage of
the domestic mortgage book funded by retail savings fell to 80 per cent (86
per cent).
Operating profits before bad debts rose 20 per cent to Pounds 523m (Pounds
435m). Sir Christopher Tugendhat, chairman, said the result was
'encouraging, given that the UK housing market is only just beginning to
emerge from a prolonged recession'.
Sir Christopher said that Abbey believed trading results in France might be
improved by interest rate cuts. He said it was committed to French
operations, although it was 'difficult to make strategic decisions in the
eye of a storm'.
The group has failed to sell its Cornerstone estate agency chain, which it
put up for sale six months ago. Sir Christopher said it was 'negotiating
with other parties' over the chain.
Treasury profits rose 74 per cent to Pounds 66m (Pounds 38m) but the growth
of its treasury balance sheet, which was 48 per cent bigger at Pounds 24.3bn
(Pounds 16.4bn), slowed to 4 per cent over the period as Abbey curtailed
expansion.
Mr Peter Birch, chief executive, said the results reflected an inadequate
return on shareholders' funds of Pounds 3.3bn, but he expected it to improve
as it eliminated 'problem children' such as French commercial lending.
Post-tax earnings fell 5 per cent to Pounds 164m because of a tax charge of
46 per cent, pushed up by unrelieved French losses. The interim dividend was
raised 9 per cent to 4.15p (3.8p), while earnings per share slipped to 12.5
(13.2p).
The share price closed 9p up at 392p.

FT  03 AUG 93 / Jumping through the credit ratings hoop: Derivatives
business squeezed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Of all the risks involved in derivatives trading, the one that troubles
market participants most is credit risk. They are worried about taking on
exposure to companies that are financially weaker than themselves, and even
more worried that other dealers may not want to trade with them.
In the past 10 years, there has been a decline in the financial strength of
banks and their credit ratings have dropped accordingly. This decline in
credit quality has a greater impact in the Dollars 4,000bn (Pounds 2,700bn)
over-the-counter market in swaps and options, where contracts typically last
between three and 10 years, than in the foreign exchange market, for
example, where exposure to a counterparty is brief.
The crunch for banks and securities houses comes when their ratings fall to
single-A, as many firms are limited by internal restrictions to dealing with
credits rated double-A and above.
Banks with less than top credit ratings are being squeezed out of the market
because their clients prefer to deal with better credits. The result is
that, although the market is expanding rapidly, business is becoming
increasingly concentrated among a handful of banks. Mr David Mullins,
vice-chairman of the board of governors of the Federal Reserve, estimates
that about 90 per cent of business is conducted by just six US banks.
As many banks now believe that a strong derivatives operation is vital to
international banking business, they have not taken the threat lying down.
'The swaps business is so important to our underwriting business that we
would never allow ourselves to be squeezed out of the market,' said one US
banker.
One remedy is for lower-rated companies to set up separately capitalised
subsidiaries with top ratings, through which to channel derivatives
business.
So far, only two, Merrill Lynch and Salomon Brothers, have taken this route.
The setting up of a derivatives unit backed by fully committed capital, with
the prerequisite credit rating, restores an institution's access to clients
previously unwilling to accept the parent company's credit rating. But if
the subsidiary fails to generate fresh business, then the parent will have
used up scarce and expensive capital to no avail.
Currently, analysts at Moody's, the US credit rating agency, have 18
proposals for separately capitalised derivatives units on their desks, but
it is unlikely that all of these will go ahead. Some firms have met with
opposition from their parent companies or the regulators, while others are
not yet convinced the plan represents the best use of capital.
Citibank, which in any case faced opposition from the Office of the
Comptroller of the Currency, one of its US regulators, has abandoned plans
for a swaps unit and is concentrating instead on improving the credit rating
of the bank (currently rated A2 by Moody's and A by Standard &amp; Poor's).
Kidder Peabody, which is unrated, is considering seeking a rating in its own
right. Kidder's parent, General Electric of the US, has a triple-A rating.
Others - such as Morgan Stanley and Lehman Brothers - are still looking at
setting up separately capitalised units. Some Japanese banks, such as Tokai
Bank, are considering following suit.
But even those keen to go ahead have some reservations. 'This could be
nothing more than a high stakes poker game,' said one US banker.
The market is finding other solutions. Many weaker financial institutions
have started setting aside a portion of the value of the contract as
collateral against swap agreements, imitating the practice in the futures
market. This substantially reduces credit exposure for counterparties, but
many market participants still find it easier to deal with a triple-A rated
counterparty than to bother with collateral.
A survey conducted as part of the recent G30 report on derivatives found
that two-thirds of dealers were prepared to accept cash or securities as
collateral, and more than three-quarters would accept a third-party
guarantee.
The most radical solution - which would effectively eradicate the issue of
credit - is to set up a clearing house through which all over-the-counter
derivatives could be settled. However, there are enormous technical
difficulties in designing a system that could deal with such diverse
instruments.
Further, the vested interests of individual firms would not necessarily be
served. For example, triple-A rated firms, and those firms that have set up
separately capitalised subsidiaries, would lose their competitive advantage.
As a result, it may prove difficult to gain sufficient backing for such a
concept.
Several organisations are researching the creation of derivatives clearing
houses, including the Chicago Board of Trade, which already clears its own
futures and options contracts.
It is still not clear which direction the market will ultimately take.
Another crop of new subsidiaries would increase the pressure on lower-rated
banks to follow suit. 'We did it because our clients wanted us to,' said Mr
Dennis Keagan, co-head of Salomon Brothers in London.
But some market participants may not be able to afford to inject large
amounts of capital into their businesses, even if they risk finding
themselves excluded from the market.
'It is only worthwhile if your rating is bad enough and your business flow
is large enough to justify the commitment of capital,' said Mr Nick Burge,
head of swaps at Nomura International in London.

FT  03 AUG 93 / Motorola gets cash for global mobile telephone service
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN and LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MOTOROLA yesterday completed the Dollars 800m (Pounds 540m) first round of
financing for a project to launch 66 telecommunications satellites to create
the world's first global mobile telephone service. The scheme, called
Iridium, is the first of several rival proposals to move beyond the drawing
board.
If it goes ahead, it will be the largest ever private sector aerospace
investment. Iridium Inc has already signed a Dollars 3.4bn contract with its
minority stakeholder parent, Motorola, to design and build the network.
Motorola plans to start a service in 1998 that will allow mobile telephone
owners to make calls from anywhere in the world. Other services will include
paging and facsimile.
The first round of financing for Iridium has attracted cash from companies
in the state and private sectors in North and South America, Europe and
Asia.
US investors include Raytheon, the aerospace company, and Sprint, the
telecommunications service provider. Stet, the holding company for Italy's
domestic and international telecoms businesses is involved as is the Mawarid
Group, a Saudi Arabian industrial group. Japanese investors, including Sony,
Mitsubishi and Mitsui, have invested as the Nippon Iridium Corporation.
Many of these investors will act as service providers to domestic and
regional customers.
Motorola has invested about Dollars 270m of the Dollars 800m. It expects its
stake to fall to no less than 15 per cent as new investors join.
The project has drawn in two new competitors in the satellite launch
business: Russia's Khrunichev Enterprise, which builds the Proton rocket;
and China's Great Wall Industry Corporation, which makes the Long March
series of satellite launchers.
Regulatory hurdles remain as Motorola competes with other proposed satellite
telephone systems for approval from the US Federal Communications Commission
and authorities in other countries.
In securing the financing, Motorola has overtaken its rivals, which include
Inmarsat, the mobile telecommunications co-operative owned by 69 national
telephone operators, and Loral, the US satellite manufacturer.

FT  03 AUG 93 / BBA's era of big deals closes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BBA, the engineering group, attempted to draw a line under the last eight
years of big deals and rights issues as it reported profits before tax and
exceptional items of Pounds 33.1m (Pounds 32.9m) in the first half of the
year.
Mr Vanni Treves, chairman, said: 'We are entering a new stage of
consolidation. We do not want to issue more equity for the foreseeable
future.'
In place of the succession of cash calls to fund new deals, Mr Treves said
the group would focus on four core businesses. The remaining parts, with
turnover of about Pounds 200m, would be sold.
The new strategy coincided with the departure of Mr John White, managing
director, due to illness.
Mr Treves rebutted speculation from some analysts and shareholders that the
board had been unhappy with Mr White's performance over the last few years.
'If Mr White had not caught a virus he would still be chief executive,' he
said.
It is understood that BBA's directors, led by its two non-executives, Mr
Lionel Stammers and Mr Robert Cooper, had been working on an 'orderly
succession', in the longer term, to Mr White before he became ill.
This was speeded up when Mr White became poorly and the group is now looking
at four possible candidates to take over as managing director, although Mr
Treves said: 'There is no sense of urgency.'
Redundancy and reorganisation costs of Pounds 7.3m were much bigger than
expected. The figure is expected to rise to Pounds 14.6m by the end of the
year, mainly because of the severity of the German recession. 'We misread
the German tea leaves,' said Mr Treves.
Borrowings fell from Pounds 187m to Pounds 163m, representing gearing of 35
per cent. The group's disposal programme, which could raise about Pounds
130m, will significantly reduce debt by the year-end.
Under the new FRS3 accounting standard, pre-tax profit rose from a restated
Pounds 28.6m to Pounds 50.3m, which includes exceptional items of Pounds
17.2m.
Operating profit rose to Pounds 45.3m (Pounds 40.9m) on increased sales of
Pounds 742m (Pounds 649.1m).
Earnings per share declined to 4.2p (4.8p). The interim dividend is
maintained at 2.25p.

FT  03 AUG 93 / Cadbury to tempt China with chocolate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CADBURY Schweppes is to bring chocolate pandas to the children of China as
part of a Pounds 20m project to establish the group as a leading provider of
confectionery to the People's Republic.
China's growing free market culture has convinced several western
manufacturers that Chinese children will be as susceptible to sweet things
as those elsewhere. Coca-Cola, which has 13 bottling plants in China,
earlier this year said it was investing a further Dollars 150m (Pounds 101m)
in the country.
Cadbury says that the 1.2bn Chinese consumed only 11,000 tonnes of chocolate
in 1991. In the same year, Britons consumed 507,000 tonnes. Cadbury's taste
tests in China had convinced it that the 20 local and imported brands
available represented a mere nibble at the market's potential.
The UK-based group has set up a joint venture partnership with the Beijing
General Corporation for Agriculture, Industry and Commerce (Baic) to build a
manufacturing plant near the Chinese capital. Cadbury will have a 75 per
cent stake and management control over the venture. The plant will begin
production in 1995 with an initial annual capacity of about 5,000 tonnes.
Baic, which is linked to the Chinese agriculture ministry, controls
Beijing's milk supply and dairy processing facilities. Before local
production begins, chocolate will be imported from the UK and Australia,
where the group already sells chocolate pandas. Other products on sale will
be Cadbury's Dairy Milk, Hazelnut, Roast Almond, Chocolate Eclairs and
Cadbury Drinking Chocolate.
All products sold in China will carry the Cadbury name in both English and
Mandarin. A phonetic translation of Cadbury into its Mandarin equivalent, Ji
Bai Li, means 'luck plus hundreds of benefits'.

FT  03 AUG 93 / PowerGen wins right to burn 'dirty fuel'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S pollution authorities have given permission for two power stations
to burn orimulsion, a mixture of bitumen and water which has been denounced
by environmentalists as 'the world's filthiest fuel'.
The Pollution Inspectorate has issued authorisations to PowerGen, the UK's
second largest private sector power generator, for its stations at Ince on
Merseyside and Richborough near Sandwich in Kent.
Both stations have been burning the fuel on an experimental basis for three
years to enable emissions tests to be made. But the authorisations, issued
last Friday, mean orimulsion is now officially deemed to be environmentally
acceptable.
The authorisations carry a number of conditions. PowerGen must closely
monitor and report its emissions. It must also draw up a plan to install
equipment at both power stations to clean up exhaust gases, although this
does not need to be in operation until April 1998. The inspectorate has also
set emission limits which should prevent the stations being run at full
capacity.
Orimulsion is a proprietary product made in Venezuela and imported into the
UK by a company jointly owned by Petroleos de Venezuela, the state oil
company, and British Petroleum. It is cheaper than oil or gas, but its
controversial environmental reputation - it has been accused of causing acid
rain - has prevented widespread use.
The UK pollution authorities have decided, however, that orimulsion is no
dirtier overall than other fuels, and can be burnt without jeopardising the
commitment to reduce acid rain and prevent global warming.
The authorisations will anger the environmental lobby, but also come at a
sensitive time for the coal industry.

FT  03 AUG 93 / US warns Serbs to halt attacks: Nato discusses air strikes
as Bosnian position falls to 'huge offensive'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   GENEVA, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US OFFICIALS yesterday sought to step up pressure on Bosnian Serbs to halt
their military advance by presenting to a Nato conference in Brussels plans
for tougher military action.
Nato ambassadors interrupted talks last night after eight hours to consult
their governments on a draft resolution on possible action within a United
Nations framework. This was expected to include air strikes, which have been
at the forefront of Washington's proposals.
In Geneva, however, international mediators warned that the threat of air
strikes, and the surge of fighting in Bosnia, could stall the peace process.
In Sarajevo, Mr Ejup Ganic, the Bosnian vice-president, said Serb forces had
captured Mount Bjelasnica, a key Bosnian position which overlooks the
besieged capital, in a 'huge offensive'.
The attack prompted Mr Alija Izetbegovic, the Bosnian president, to threaten
to pull out of the peace negotiations if the Serbs did not give up their
latest prize.
Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, was reported to have agreed to
surrender the mountain to UN control.
Speaking in public for the first time since the talks started last week in
Geneva, Mr Izetbegovic called for international military action in the area.
'We are carrying on talks without counting on any kind of military action .
. . although we think it would be high time for the Americans and
international community to come to our defence,' he said.
As Nato ambassadors met, President Bill Clinton said in Washington he
expected the allies to agree on a strategy. 'I don't believe the allies will
permit Sarajevo to either fall or to starve,' he said. 'I think we'll have a
common position.'
Reflecting attempts to force the pace on the issue, Mr Warren Christopher,
secretary of state, said the US was determined to 'move forward quickly' to
break the Sarajevo siege through air strikes. In a private letter to Mr
Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary-general, he said air power must be put
'at the service of diplomacy'.
Disagreement remains over whether the action should be limited to protecting
the Nato ground forces and their humanitarian efforts or extended to
enforcing the 'safe areas'.

FT  03 AUG 93 / The Lex Column: Abbey National
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Abbey National's interim results are in stark contrast with those of Lloyds
Bank which kicked off the current bank season on Friday. Whereas Abbey has
been busy increasing both its loan book and its gross operating income,
Lloyds has been cautious on the former with results that have disappointed
the stock market on the latter. But Lloyds boasts a net return on equity of
21 per cent; at Abbey, the figure is a modest 10 per cent.
In pushing Abbey's shares 2 per cent higher yesterday, the market appears to
be signalling it is growth prospects which matter most. But Abbey's shares
are partly rebounding after a period of weakness. Its increased mortgage
market share has been achieved at the expense of greater recourse to
wholesale funding with a consequent squeeze on margins. Since the mortgage
market is highly competitive, this pressure could well continue.
A lower tax rate as the need abates for provisions on French lending will
help increase Abbey's return on capital. But Abbey's claim that it needs a
generous capital ratio because of its unfamiliar name, particularly in
international bond markets, is starting to look lame. That raises the
strategic stakes. Management has not thus far covered itself in glory with
its attempts to diversify - witness yesterday's blushes over French
commercial property loans. If it cannot invest surplus capital wisely, Abbey
should soon become bolder about returning it.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Those who suspected that the Bundesbank was never keen on the single
currency project will doubtless view the events of the past week as
significant. Germany is now free to pursue an anti-inflationary policy in
support of the D-Mark without a gaggle of aspirant strong currencies
struggling in its wake, which is probably what some in Frankfurt wanted all
along. The effective collapse of the ERM will in all probability slow the
pace of German rate cuts. THis is in part because the massive intervention
in support of the ERM will make the money supply data pretty grim reading in
the next few months. But the recession is still biting deep in Germany.
Inflationary pressures, and interest rates, will be easing by the autumn.
As with the UK, the appreciation of the D-Mark will be at least partly
offset by stronger export markets. Indeed, exports are likely to lead the
German recovery next year, especially as the D-Mark has been been falling
against a strong dollar and stronger yen in 1993. Other components of growth
will, however, offer little help. The public sector deficit is already too
high, while wage growth will be sluggish, limiting domestic consumption. And
with capacity utilisation low, there is little incentive to invest in plant.
Exporters may thus be the most attractive area of the stock market, whatever
the short-term rise in the currency may suggest.

It was perhaps too much to hope that the chancellor could resist the
temptation to say 'I told you so'. Still, at least Mr Clarke managed to bite
his tongue until Sunday morning, which showed some restraint. The glee in
Whitehall seems justified, and not just because it covers the UK's
embarrassment over last September's undignified exit from the ERM. Once the
shock of the last few days' events has passed, continental interest rates
outside Germany should start to fall. That would land the UK in the happy
position of having to decide between an appreciation of sterling or falling
interest rates. Given that events are already flowing the chancellor's way,
he may be tempted to hold back on interest rates until the autumn.
There are other benefits for the UK too. With sterling firm, and a further
eventual cut in base rates probable rather than possible, gilt yields may
well fall too. A revival in continental markets will improve export
prospects for British companies, albeit at a somewhat higher exchange rate.
UK growth is thus likely to be stronger next year than previously estimated
 -with domestic consumption taking a larger slice of the total.
As there is little sign of inflationary pressures, all that augurs well for
equities. The market has been nervous with equity yields below 4 per cent,
but with bond yields and interest rates around their lowest levels for a
generation, such fears may ease. That said, investors still have to get
through the company reporting season in September, which may show little
sign of the much-trumpeted recovery. And however unlikely it may seem now,
any spark of renewed inflation would have the markets running for cover.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Having finally summoned up the courage to cast off the shackles of the ERM,
European governments are surprisingly reluctant to use their new freedom.
Perhaps the lack of news on interest rate cuts yesterday means finance
ministers still do not understand it was unbearably high interest rates -
and not speculators - that brought the system to its knees. Perhaps, like
Britain last autumn, they must endure a period of nervous anxiety about
inflation and the exchange rate before setting policy firmly on course for
recovery. That could explain the muted response of equity markets to the
weekend's developments. Granted Danish shares rose by 4 per cent, but the
Paris market was up by only 2 per cent. In Madrid and Brussels the gains
were even less.
Unless governments deliver the hoped-for interest rate cuts reasonably soon
there is a risk that even such a modest overall advance could stall. None of
the markets with newly liberated currencies is likely to show the kind of
spurt London put on after the UK left the ERM. To a greater or lesser degree
Sunday night or something similar was discounted in advance. That only adds
to the risk of disappointment. It may well be that the French franc has
further to fall as interest rates are cut. Sterling began to recover only
after rates had fallen to 6 per cent and some real economic recovery was in
sight. But the French authorities would be deluding themselves if they
thought holding interest rates steady would support the franc for long.
Foreign exchange markets would then be back to worrying about growth
forgone, rising unemployment and a mounting budget deficit. Sooner or later,
lower short-term rates will have to come.

FT  03 AUG 93 / The school of hard knocks: Can the European Community
survive the pressures imposed by the ERM debacle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In Brussels yesterday, senior European Community officials appeared in shock
as they woke up to a world of floating European exchange rates. The
explosion within the European exchange rate mechanism ends 15 years of
relative currency stability and will play havoc with farm support prices,
the Common Agricultural Policy and the EC budget.
'We have not experienced anything like this,' said Mr Henning
Christophersen, EC economics commissioner. 'We may have to adjust farm
prices every third day.'
Sir Roy Denman, former EC ambassador in Washington, was one of the few
looking beyond immediate setbacks and remaining sanguine. He argued that the
case for exchange rate stability and monetary co-operation leading to a
single currency is as strong as ever. Paraphrasing General Charles De
Gaulle's message on June 18 1940, Sir Roy said: 'Europe has lost a battle,
but it has not lost the war.'
As the dust settled, the list of political casualties grew. Mr Jacques
Delors, president of the European Commission, who pleaded in vain on Sunday
night for the D-Mark to leave the ERM, looks mortally wounded. For it was Mr
Delors who seized upon the ERM as the vehicle for forcing European economies
to 'converge' in order to reach European Monetary Union (Emu) within a fixed
timetable.
Mr Delors' world of grand designs and logical structures was suited
perfectly to the expanding European economies of the 1980s, which paved the
foundation for the single European market; but the pillars of the old order
came tumbling down through the external shocks of German unification and a
deeper-than-expected recession.
Now the Community must discover whether it has the strength and political
resilience to recover its internal equilibrium, or whether more turmoil is
in the offing. As one senior EC official put it: 'The question is not
whether we can move forward, but whether we avoid going backwards.'
Commission officials are already starting to lay the groundwork for a
rearguard action. The strategy will be discussed at a meeting of the full
Commission on Friday, at which Mr Delors, still suffering from sciatica,
will be present.
The first priority will be to stress that the ERM is not dead but remains
'in suspended animation'. All the EC finance ministers, including Mr Kenneth
Clarke, UK chancellor, came down against suspending the entire ERM system
when they met in Brussels on Sunday. There was a common understanding of the
importance of trying to maintain currency stability.
Thus the old EMS structures remain intact; the same rules on intervention
apply, albeit within much wider fluctuation margins; and there is at least
the technical possibility that the one-time hard core of stronger
currencies, including the German, French and Benelux, can be put back
together again.
Meanwhile, the Commission will continue to press the case for economic
convergence according to the timetable laid down in the Maastricht treaty,
stricter budget discipline, and the preparation for the second stage of Emu,
due to begin on January 1 1994. This involves tighter EC surveillance of
European economies and the (largely symbolic) opening of the European
Monetary Institute, the forerunner of the putative European Central Bank -
assuming EC leaders can agree on a location and a president.
The second priority will be the single market. Largely ignored in recent
months because of monetary turmoil, the 1992 project to allow the freedom of
movement of goods, services, people and capital continues to gain in
credibility.
Last week the Commission unveiled plans for harmonising the protection of
design and intellectual property rights; this week, the risk is that de
facto floating exchange rates could tempt member states into competitive
devaluations which could undermine the single market.
The third priority is enlargement negotiations with Austria, Finland, Norway
and Sweden. Community membership for the sceptical Nordics was always going
to be a hard sell; the dent in the EC's image means it will be even harder.
The fourth priority will be Mr Delors' own white paper on competitiveness -
the wide-ranging study on why Europe is failing to create jobs at the rate
of the US and Asia, and what it can do to restore steady economic growth.
Mr Wim Kok, Dutch finance minister, said early yesterday that the Delors
paper could serve as the basis for a much more profound reflection on the
common push for Emu. In Mr Kok's view, the crisis in the ERM had exposed
fault-lines within the Community. The deflationary pressures inherent in
Maastricht's convergence criteria had pushed up unemployment in member
states, raising threats to social stability. Some member states were clearly
unwilling to pay the price of staying the course - a blunt reference to
France.
It is now clear that it will be virtually impossible for most EC member
states to meet the convergence targets on government debt, inflation and
budget deficits by 1997, the date for monetary union. Mr Christophersen
conceded as much yesterday when he agreed that the earliest date for Emu
could only occur if a majority of currencies were in narrow ERM fluctuation
bands by the end of 1994 - a prospect that seems remote.
Some in the Commission would like to see a loosening of the convergence
criteria to make Emu more credible. But such a development looks unlikely in
the face of Germany's insistence that domestic economic interests take
precedence over European considerations, and that the price of giving up the
D-Mark for a single currency must be price stability.
These twin imperatives were displayed by the Bundesbank's token interest
rate cut on Thursday. This left the French franc at the mercy of the
financial markets. The climax came on Sunday when the Germans would not let
the French bully them into a de facto revaluation of the D-Mark or a public
commitment to reduce short-term interest rates.
Mr Theo Waigel, German finance minister, spelled out on several occasions in
his early morning press conference yesterday that the Bundesbank had gone
out of its way to support weaker member currencies. 'We have more than
fulfilled our (ERM) obligations.'
Such strong words betray a certain resentment over French tactics; but one
European monetary official countered that the French and Germans had at
least opened the crisis talks on Sunday with a joint proposal for the D-Mark
to leave the system - only to have the deal founder on the opposition of the
Dutch, followed by Belgium, Luxembourg and Denmark.
Thus, Germany is ready to compromise; but continues to be the dominant force
within the Community. In the past 12 months, events such as the initial
Danish rejection of Maastricht have raised questions about whether the
treaty is the correct approach for accommodating Germany, or whether looser
arrangements are required - for example, accelerating membership of former
communist countries.
Commission officials argue that inviting Poland, the Czech Republic and
Hungary, or even Slovenia, into the EC would destabilise the Community and
could wreck uncompetitive eastern economies. But some German officials and
other diplomats acknowledge that early membership could help to balance
German might while strengthening the political cohesion of the former
eastern bloc countries.
An equally profound question-mark hangs over the resilience of the EC
itself, and whether it is simply 'a fair-weather community', an institution
which can function efficiently only in good economic times but which remains
acutely vulnerable to external shocks - such as the war in former
Yugoslavia.
This is the third time, after all, that the dream of European monetary union
set out in the Werner report in 1970 has foundered. First came the 1973
oil-shock; then the second oil-shock in 1979. Now, German unification
appears to have blown the project off-course.
Mr Christophersen is optimistic. Putting on a brave face yesterday, he
rejected the UK government's assertions that there were 'fault-lines' in the
ERM. 'I don't think the system was flawed, but the system was more fragile
than we thought.' He could well have been talking about the Community.

<TEXT>
The crisis in the European Monetary System raises new doubts whether the
central core of the Maastricht treaty, the programme for economic and
monetary union, can be implemented as prescribed. These doubts are partly
technical, but only partly. The more serious question is whether Europe is
emotionally ready for the idea.
At a technical level, European Community finance ministers have been able to
rescue the Exchange Rate Mechanism after a fashion. The widening of the
bands may be sufficient to accommodate both the Bundesbank's commitment to a
tight monetary policy and the rest of Europe's need for monetary relaxation.
But this salvage operation leaves unresolved the problem of how, or indeed
whether, the EC is to take the next steps towards monetary union.
The more serious doubts are political. The monetary crisis has stirred up
powerful populist emotions in member states - often nationalist and even
xenophobic - so that it is quite difficult to imagine conditions in which
voters would acquiesce in surrendering control over their national
currencies.
These reactions have been particularly acute in France. In itself, this is
not surprising: on one hand, the franc has been the prime target of market
pressure; on the other, the franc fort has been invested with all the
symbolism of national virility in being made the central plank of economic
policy by all governments, on the left and the right, for the past 10 years.
If the intensity of popular interest is measured in column inches, the
French carry off the prize. Last Saturday Le Monde gave the lead story and
four inside pages to the monetary crisis. Yesterday Figaro gave it the lead
story and nine inside pages. By contrast, yesterday's Financial Times gave
it only the lead story and two inside pages.
What is more surprising about some French comment has been its atavistic
character, notably from some people who should know better. The former
socialist foreign minister, Roland Dumas, described Sunday's settlement as a
victory for les anglo-saxons who had opposed European integration from the
outset. Even Raymond Barre, a former conservative prime minister and
internationally known economist, has insinuated that the speculation against
the franc was indirectly orchestrated by British or American authorities.
Even Le Monde has sought to perpetuate the notion of a deep gulf between
France and the Anglo-Saxons. According to its editorial on Saturday, the
European currency crisis was a confrontation between two cultures: the
continentals, committed to dirigism, and the Anglo-Saxons, viscerally
attached to liberalism and free trade; and within this antithesis, there is
the opposition between the French commitment to fixed exchange rates and the
Anglo-Saxon belief in floating exchange rates.
This contradiction is all the more poignant, in the picture painted by Le
Monde, because France is isolated. It has long preached the cause of managed
exchange rates, but it has great difficulty in recruiting allies for its
point of view because the Germans are so ambivalent.
It is a touching picture, but strangely anachronistic and unreal. French
traditions, no doubt, used to be enthusiastically dirigiste, but that was
some time ago. The revolutionary fact about the past 10 years has been
France's comprehensive conversion to market forces: privatisation,
deregulation and, above all, to the removal of exchange control. Nobody
would deny the France's long-standing commitment to fixed exchange rates.
But to equate it with a dirigism that has long been abandoned is simply
absurd. It shows that, in moments of high stress, ancient reflexes reassert
themselves, even when real conditions have changed.
By the same token, the picture of the anglo-saxons as unanimously wedded to
floating exchange rates is baffling. Has Le Monde forgotten that John Major
was totally committed to British membership of the ERM until Black
Wednesday, less than a year ago?
The real fault-line is not between the French, united on dirigism, and the
British, united on free trade. It runs through both countries, between the
pro-Europeans and the nationalists; Norman Lamont and Philippe Seguin,
Norman Tebbit and Jean-Pierre Chevenement are all on the same side.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
YESTERDAY'S agreement by EC finance ministers to recast the exchange rate
mechanism was one of the more dramatic and desperate tactical retreats in
the community's history. In delivering such a painful blow to French
political amour propre, it may yet unleash deadly recriminations.
Certainly it would have been better if the community had faced up earlier to
the fact that an inflexible ERM was likely to shatter on the rock of the
Bundesbank's legitimate determination to preserve its reputation for
controlling inflation during the testing post-unification period. It would
have been more logical and should have been possible for the community to
agree to reorientate the ERM, rather than waiting for the markets to blow it
out of the water. Had Germany been willing to depart temporarily from the
system, its remaining members would have been free to bring down their own
interest rates in a co-ordinated fashion and the weekend's embarrassments
might have been avoided.
But the most important point about the Brussels decision to move to broader
fluctuation bands is that it is a lot better than the available
alternatives: persisting with a policy which has driven Europe into a
recession of quite unnecessary depth, or abandoning the system entirely.
Indeed, the progressive re-shaping of the ERM in the last year can be seen
alongside the grudging public support for the Maastricht treaty as
delivering an unforgettable message: that the community must not allow its
dreams to run too far ahead of economic and political realities. If it does,
then its core achievement of having constructed from the chaos of post-war
Europe an effective single market and a base for more ambitious joint
political projects will be placed in jeopardy. These are the stakes as the
community adjusts to its new realities.
The good news is that monetary conditions can now be eased in Europe, even
though it appears likely that significant interest rate cuts in Germany may
still be some months away.
Unemployment rising
Mr Edouard Balladur, the French prime minister, has stated his determination
to use his new freedom cautiously, but he will surely recognise the case for
using it. With unemployment at 11.6 per cent and rising, and his colleagues
on the French right positioning themselves for a presidential election race,
he should take an early opportunity to lop a couple of points off interest
rates, although he will seek to achieve this with as little damage to the
franc as possible. Given the fundamentals of the French economy, this ought
to be achievable. As rates fall across most of Europe, economic prospects
will brighten, although a full return of confidence will not be possible
without the return of fiscal discipline and economic momentum in Germany.
The more debatable question is how the EC should proceed from here. Finance
ministers have set a target of January 1994 to return to narrow bands, at
which point the Maastricht treaty says the second stage of Economic and
Monetary Union should start.
Realistic objective
It is too early to judge whether this is a realistic objective. Rather than
spending too much time considering the Maastricht timetable for Emu, member
states should set about making a bigger success of their managed system of
floating exchange rates than they have, in recent times, of running the ERM.
Prior to the formal creation in January of the European Monetary Institute,
a committee of EC central bankers, this will not be a simple task. With the
Maastricht criteria for economic convergence a less rigidly fixed lodestar
than hitherto, member states now face squarely their own responsibilities,
desirable in their own right, to pursue credible, low-inflation economic
strategies.
If this easing of European monetary policy can be accomplished without an
outbreak of ill-tempered beggar-my-neighbour devaluations, it may indeed be
possible for the community to consider an early return to narrow bands. But
whether or not this target is met, the community cannot avoid the search for
effective mechanisms for monetary co-ordination. Rather than placing all its
bets on simply being able to restore narrow bands next year, it should
consider more far-reaching ERM reforms. Those who yesterday pronounced
Maastricht and the Emu process inoperable ignore the fact that the single
market remains incomplete, and sufficiently fragile for it not to be able to
withstand sustained volatility in exchange rates between member countries.
In Britain, the weekend's events have occasioned some misplaced
schadenfreude. More appropriate would be a sense of regret that Mr John
Major is so politically damaged that he cannot even consider rejoining a
more relaxed ERM, so resuming his position at the centre of the difficult
negotiations still to come about the community's monetary arrangements.

If a pair of dinosaurs had purchased a 100-million-year life annuity paying
out Dollars 416.66 each month, how much dosh would their heirs have received
to date?
The answer is half a trillion dollars (Dollars 500bn), which is also the
value of the assets Merrill Lynch now holds in custody on behalf of its
clients worldwide. Celebrating this target achieved earlier in the year, the
American broker has been holding an internal competition to see who could
make sense of such a big number.
So far, Observer's favourite calculation is the one that concludes that half
a trillion is the sum the American Indians would today find in their cash
management account had they invested the Dollars 24 received for the sale of
Manhattan at a rate of 6.69 per cent per annum.

If the leaders of former Soviet countries are seeking entrepreneurial

When the 130 vessels arrived at the end of the first leg in Bergen, their
crews mostly turned in for a rest. But not so those of the Russian and
Polish ships.
Not only on the decks but all along the dockside, they had soon set up
stalls and were trading all manner of things for Norwegian kroner. The
dearest items were clothing, with uniform jackets and caps going at NKr150
or so. Among the cheapest were hammer and sickle badges, priced the same as
jam pancakes at NKr15 apiece.

The City's blue-chip merchant banks often like to lend their directors to
the boards of companies performing below par. So perhaps the arrival of
Jeremy Lancaster, chairman of Wolseley, as a non-executive director of
Kleinwort Benson, proves that it can be a two-way process.
Kleinwort, currently searching for a chief executive, has seen better days
whereas Lancaster is one of Britain's more successful industrialists. Given
that he is also the son of Wolseley's founder, he knows what it's like to be
brought up in a family firm which needed to change its ways. His success
during his 17 years at the Wolseley helm has been based on great attention
to detail and a restlessness which has kept his management on their toes.
However, getting this simple message across to the other 22 directors around
the Kleinwort boardroom table could prove a challenge. Hope he didn't take
the job just because he was flattered by Kleinwort's interest in him.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Only an eternal optimist would think that the events of the past few days
make an ideal backdrop for the relaunch of yet another pan-European venture.
However, John Drew, who headed the UK office of the EC Commission until a
few months ago, is one such.
As director designate of Europa Times, a monthly which claims to be Europe's
largest circulation English language newspaper, Drew has big plans. The
paper, which has been going for a year, is bankrolled by Felix Grovit, a
Brussels-based business man who has made a fortune out of his 100-plus
network of bureaux de change in 11 countries.
Since it is handed out free, a circulation figure of half a million readers
has to be taken with a pinch of salt. But its owner, who was said to be
interested in buying The European at one stage, feels the time is ripe for
expansion and Drew is the man for the job.
Drew, who is already visiting professor of European management at the Open
University and president of the Institute of Linguists, promises to give the
new venture his best shot. Having spent his whole career trying to get the
European message across, he says that there is nothing wrong with the
concept, it's simply been put over badly.

As their continental brethren survey the shards of the EMS, British
politicians have been exceeding even their usual propensity to rewrite
history with the latest round of 'I told you so's'.
Euro-enthusiast Kenneth Clarke indulged in it on the way to Brussels on
Sunday, while John Major recalled his warning last autumn of the
'fault-lines' which had led to sterling's ejection. Anyone would have
thought the lot of them had stage-managed Black Wednesday down to the last
second - instead of spending oodles of taxpayers' money trying hopelessly to
man the defences.
Lady Thatcher, by contrast, has something of a genuine claim to gloat.
Observer recalls an animated conversation with the Iron Lady more than three
years ago when she detailed how German reunification would rip the system
apart. But she will be disinclined to trumpet her prescience; it was, after
all, she who failed to talk her then chancellor, Major, out of the idea,
hence landing Britain in there in the first place.

FT  03 AUG 93 / Leading Article: A fresh start in schools
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS TOO soon to say with certainty that Sir Ron Dearing's report on the
national curriculum and its assessment will bring an end to the confusion
over testing in English schools. But the report contains many of the
ingredients needed to address the justified concerns of the critics of the
current arrangements. It also appears to hold fast to the basic and
necessary principles of the government's education reforms.
The national curriculum, compulsory testing and the publication of school
league tables are central to raising the standard of British education. The
curriculum provides a set of educational targets which parents have a right
to expect teachers to work towards. Testing at 7, 11, 14 and 16 measures
achievement in meeting those targets. The publication of test results in
league tables allows parents to compare school performance and provides a
spur to schools that are failing to deliver.
The government's reforms ran into difficulty largely because of confusion
over the purpose of testing. Simple tests were needed to assess individual
pupil achievement so that school performance could be compared nationwide.
Their creators tried to devise tests that could also diagnose individual
pupils' needs, so increasing their complexity. The result was complicated
tests requiring a complicated curriculum to sustain them. Teachers concerned
about the use of test results in league tables were able to unite more
moderate colleagues, parents, governors and even some of the government's
advisers against the unwieldy and over-prescriptive structure.
Level of achievement
Sir Ron has gone to the heart of the problem with his proposal to focus
tests on establishing the level of achievement of pupils throughout the
country. Other purposes of testing, such as the diagnosis of individual
pupils' needs, should be left to teachers. He also sensibly recommends that
the compulsory tests should concentrate on basic skills: English,
mathematics and science. These changes would create shorter and sharper
tests, making it harder for teacher unions to protest over the workload
involved.
They also allow the national curriculum to be slimmed down to occupy less
than 90 per cent of the timetable in primary schools, and to three-quarters
in secondary schools. Even at these levels, the curriculum will still
dominate the day-to-day business of the classroom, perhaps excessively so.
However, Sir Ron's report restores flexibility to teachers and allows
freedom to tailor the timetable to pupils' individual needs.
Price of peace
The government has wisely accepted Sir Ron's proposals without
qualification. The decision raises questions over the future of Mr John
Patten, the Education Secretary. Currently suffering from a viral infection,
he stood fast against such concessions only a few months ago.
Because of that intransigence, the price of buying peace has risen. In
accepting Sir Ron's recommendations, the government had to go one step
further by abandoning league tables for the tests at 7 and 14. There is
justification for this step. What matters to parents in choosing a primary
school is the achievement of children leaving it at 11 to go on to secondary
education. At secondary level, it is performance at the minimum
school-leaving age of 16 that is important.
There is a danger, however, that this will be seen as a retreat on the
principle of publishing league tables. The proposals announced yesterday
offer the basis for a fresh start in school education. But they should not
mark an end to the process of change which is so badly needed to raise
standards in Britain's schools.

FT  03 AUG 93 / An unhealthy outcome: German reforms have hit drug sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Horst Seehofer, Germany's health minister, should be content. The reforms
he launched in January to rein in spending on medicines have proved
successful.
The German drugs market, last year Europe's largest and growing at about 10
per cent a year, has been thrown into sharp reverse. Over the first five
months of this year sales have fallen by 11 per cent.
Mr Seehofer's counterpart at the economics ministry is, however, less likely
to be enthusiastic. According to Mr Hans Joachim Langmann, chairman of E
Merck, the family-owned German drugs group, 'the world is falling apart' for
drug manufacturers.
While the company may be overstating the case, two developments are likely:
first, research and development could be adversely affected, particularly
among small companies, many of which say they can no longer afford to
develop new products; second, the reforms may trigger a restructuring of the
sector.
The threat to the large groups' R&amp;D spending seems minimal. But many small
and medium-sized groups have not been able to absorb the fall in their sales
and maintain R&amp;D spending. The Bundes verband der Pharmazeutscher Industrie
(BPI), the industry association, says 41 per cent of the 126 companies it
surveyed in February planned to cut R&amp;D budgets.
The package introduced by Mr Seehofer included an across-the-board 5 per
cent price cut for prescription medicines followed by a price freeze for the
same categories until the end of 1994. Prescription charges have also been
raised, dampening demand.
But it has been Mr Seehofer's cuts in doctors' drugs budgets that have
really hit sales. He set their 1993 budget at DM24bn, the same level as in
1991 and DM3bn below last year's figure. If doctors exceed their budget, the
first DM280m excess will be borne by them personally.
Mr Walter Wenninger, managing director of the healthcare division of Bayer,
Germany's second-largest pharmaceuticals group after Hoechst, says: 'The
threat of financial penalties (has) led to a truly awful change in
prescribing habits, forcing doctors to cut both the number and value of
their prescriptions.'
The scale of the collapse in sales has been unprecedented. Dr Heinz Ried,
managing director of domestic operations at Boehringer-Ingelheim, the
pharmaceuticals group, says that, on present trends, Germany's drugs bill
this year could undershoot by as much as DM6bn, or 25 per cent.
For some companies the initial impact of the reforms has been severe. The
BPI survey of companies representing 64 per cent of the German market found
that more than half had seen falls in domestic turnover of 30-50 per cent in
February.
Small and medium-sized groups, which have little international exposure and
often sell traditional herbal-based medicines, have been hit hard. Madaus,
for example, a small family-owned group in Cologne, has seen domestic sales
fall by 20 per cent in the six months to June.
The downturn has also hit the giants of the German industry. Bayer has seen
its sales fall by 10 per cent so far this year after an increase of 9 per
cent for the whole of last year. Boehringer-Ingelheim expects its domestic
sales to drop this year by between 10 per cent and 12 per cent, leading to a
reduction in turnover of up to DM100m.
The German subsidiaries of foreign groups are suffering too. Astra, the
fast-growing Swedish group and seventh-largest drugs company in Germany,
posted first-quarter sales down by 16 per cent in what is its largest single
market. Ciba, the Swiss group and fourth-largest pharmaceuticals company in
Germany, reported a 17 per cent fall in German turnover during the first six
months of this year, compared with an increase of 9 per cent in the whole of
1992.
The only groups to have benefited from the reforms are companies selling
cheaper generic products, the patents of which have expired. Doctors are
turning to cheaper medicines to keep within their budgets. Dr Michael
Steiner, vice-president of The Boston Consulting Group, management advisers,
says generics groups, which include the German groups Ratiopharm and Hexal,
have doubled their market share to about 20 per cent so far this year.
While the generics companies have welcomed the reforms, the reaction of the
drugs groups was initial incredulity. 'For the first three months the
pharmaceuticals groups couldn't believe it,' says Dr Steiner. 'They had
invested millions of D-Marks to explain the merits of their drugs. But all
that mattered for doctors was price. It was then they realised the impact of
the reforms would be lasting.'
The fall in sales has forced most groups to introduce short-term working and
cut jobs. BASF Pharma, BASF's drugs division formerly known as Knoll, will
cut its 3,785-strong German labour force by up to 15 per cent this year,
while Boehringer-Ingelheim is making up to 500 of its 2,500 workers in
Germany redundant. Madaus, the small German group, has cut its domestic
workforce by a third, from 1,200 to 800.
The overriding concern for drugs companies is that Mr Seehofer could
introduce further cuts in doctors' budgets next year. 'Nothing is more
encouraging than success. The government has seen that it costs nothing
politically to push these measures through. We expect to be squeezed more,'
says Mr Martin Vischer, head of Ciba's pharmaceuticals division. Mr Seehofer
has been able to head off doctors' protests by promising not to examine the
issue of their fees.
In any event, the structure of the pharmaceuticals industry will never be
the same. 'Cost-cutting can only go so far,' says Dr Ried at
Boehringer-Ingelheim. 'The small and medium-sized companies with little
business outside Germany will disappear or merge. They just won't have the
means to develop new medicines.'
Consolidation has yet to take place because pharmaceuticals companies have
traditionally been expensive and their prices will need to fall before big
groups become interested in buying.
Nevertheless, Mr Vischer at Ciba believes consolidation is inevitable:
'Within two years, the landscape will be unrecognisable. The smaller
companies will have gone. The generic manufacturers will still be winning
market share and the research-based companies will be trying to adapt. And
that will be painful.'
The aim of reform was to force the pharmaceuticals groups to cut costs and
deliver better value for money. Only those which manage to combine these
twin imperatives will survive. The one unexpected outcome of reform has been
the severity of its impact on small and medium companies, some of which are
now in danger of being squeezed out.

FT  03 AUG 93 / Don't pay the rich to be ill: The chancellor's dilemma: an
inside view
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BILL ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Our social security system exists to help the poor. That should not be too
expensive. We could guarantee the poorest 10 per cent of the population an
income of Pounds 100 a week for Pounds 25bn. Yet the social security budget
is more than Pounds 70bn, growing rapidly out of control, and still the
streets are full of beggars.
This situation has occurred because we choose to perpetuate a powerful myth:
that the social security system is an insurance system, to which we make
contributions (like an insurance premium), as a result of which we are
entitled to benefits if and when we become old, sick or unemployed. The
result of this is that some Pounds 40bn of the Pounds 70bn budget is spent
on the so-called contributory benefits - state pensions, unemployment and
sickness benefit. A substantial part of this money goes to people who are
not poor.
Why does a Conservative government dedicated to the principle of
privatisation run this large nationalised industry, an insurance scheme that
ignores all the basic actuarial principles and makes a massive loss? The
answer is partly historical and partly that, by giving money to people
because they meet certain conditions (old, ill, out of work) rather than
because they are poor, the government hopes to minimise the poverty trap.
The poverty trap - very high marginal rates of tax on the incomes of the
poor - is an inevitable and unwelcome consequence of means-testing  - giving
money to the poor and taking it away as they get richer. Means-testing is
necessary to target resources and keep down costs. But it does impose a high
rate of tax on those trying to escape from poverty by their own efforts.
Better, many believe, to tackle the causes of poverty, and leave people an
incentive to work.
It is a beguiling argument. The only problem is that it has turned out to be
incredibly expensive. If social security payments depend on anything but
income, you end up giving away large swathes of a Pounds 70bn budget to
well-off pensioners, well-off families with children, and well-off invalids.
But targeting is not the only thing wrong with the present system. It also
faces the classic 'moral hazard' problem that confronts all insurers: the
existence of the insurance makes the condition insured against more likely.
If you promise to pay people money when they are ill, they are more likely
to become ill. If you promise to pay them if they become single parents,
they are more likely to become single par-ents. The same is true, at the
margin, even of disablement and unemployment.
Insurance is based on the principle that an accident, like lightning,
strikes a helpless victim. In most cases, this paradigm is accurate. Most of
those who become unemployed, sick or disabled cannot change their condition
by an act of will. But what about the marginal cases? When does a backache
become so bad that you really have to stop work? And who decides that it is
that bad - you, or your doctor?
We all face days when we feel unwell. Those with highly paid, interesting
jobs are, unsurprisingly, more inclined to struggle into work than the lowly
paid in boring jobs. So if the latter are offered a new benefit when they
are unwell that is more generous than unemployment benefit or the state
pension, some who previously chose to work despite chronic illness or
disability will no longer do so. As more learn about the benefit, the number
of claimants soars. To prevent malingering, the state has to ask doctors to
judge whether these people are 'really' sick. And the natural response to
budgetary pressures is to tighten up the medical criteria - to a predictable
political outcry.
The history of invalidity benefit - payable tax free to those who are
'incapable of work because of illness or disablement' - shows what happens
if you give people money because they are sick and ask doctors to decide who
qualifies. The numbers who qualify have increased from half a million in
1978 to more than a million and a half today. And many of them are not poor.
The solution is simple. Don't give money to people because they are sick.
Give it only if their sickness makes them poor. The advantages are immense:
the state does not have to judge how sick they are; the incentive to
malinger is completely removed; the money which goes to the well-off sick is
saved; and the decision whether or not to work when somewhat unwell is taken
from doctors and given back to the individual.
Unfortunately this radical solution - abolish invalidity benefit and use
some of the money saved to make the means-tested benefits more generous - is
blocked by the insurance myth, because invalidity benefit is one of the
contributory benefits.
It is difficult to defend taking money away from the sick. It is even harder
to defend taking from the sick a benefit that they have paid for. So a
sensible transfer from better-off, supposedly unwell, people to the
genuinely poor is ruled out.
The implications are grim. The government presides over a poorly targeted
system in which benefits for the ill, for the disabled, for single parents,
are growing at a frightening speed. The numbers, small 15 years ago, are now
large enough to have a macro-economic impact. Successive governments have,
with the best intentions, drifted into commitments that are already crowding
out other desirable public spending and that are ultimately unaffordable.
In the long run these issues must be addressed. But in the immediate future
the most promising way of reining back the budget is to tackle the flat-rate
benefits which, though not especially fast-growing, are very large.
An obvious target is the Pounds 6bn in child benefit, of which a big share
goes to the better off. Means-testing it and clawing it back from them could
easily be defended, as child benefit is non-contributory.
The government also has an opportunity to save some of the Pounds 27bn cost
of the state retirement pension (a contributory benefit and therefore
normally sacrosanct) because it is required to equalise the pension age for
women and men. It should not hesitate to do so by raising the pension age
for women to 65. Failure to grasp that nettle will send the worst possible
signal to the financial markets about the government's willingness to tackle
its budget problem.
But most important of all, the government must, in its long-term spending
review, re-examine the basic principles governing our social security
system. Until they are changed, the social security budget will remain an
uncontrollable monster.

FT  03 AUG 93 / Letter: County of Cleveland enjoys favourable profile among
electors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr BRUCE STEVENSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, May I take issue with one point in John Authers' otherwise accurate
summary of the current difficulties in local government re-organisation
('Council reformer meets resistance', 26 July).
The County of Cleveland is not unpopular with its electors. The Mori opinion
poll commissioned by the Local Government Commission established that
Cleveland has one of the highest levels of county identity in all of the
nine areas so far reviewed.
County identity in Cleveland is comparable, for example, with North
Yorkshire and a little higher than other traditional counties such as
Lincolnshire, Gloucestershire and Derbyshire. Incidentally, it is twice as
high as county identity in Avon, created at the same time as Cleveland in
1974.
In another equally independent study, the University of Birmingham examined
satisfaction with county council services. Although precise comparisons were
impossible, given differences in purpose, timing and wording of different
surveys, it did become clear that satisfaction with county services in
Cleveland is among the highest recorded in England.
May I make it clear that we are nevertheless not arguing for the survival of
the county council despite much misinformed comment to that effect. We wish
to put right the mistakes of 1974. That is why we are supporting the
creation of a new local authority to reflect the identity of Teesside, which
was lost in 1974, and a second authority based on the present borough of
Hartlepool, which also lost its general powers as a result of the 1974
re-organisation. It is interesting that, in the same Local Government
Commission survey, levels of identity with Teesside were in fact even
greater than those of the county council.
This is a proposition which strikes the right balance between cost and
community identity. The proposition now has support from every large
business organisation in the area, including the Confederation of British
Industry, as well as hundreds of individual companies. It is supported by
many community organisations including parish councils, senior health
professions, organisations representing people with disabilities and
thousands of individual Teessiders.

FT  03 AUG 93 / Letter: No simple regulatory answer for BBC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ROBERT PHILLIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The picture of the BBC by Robert Baldwin and Martin Cave (Personal
View, July 30) is a painting done by numbers.
It misses the significance of our annual review, which reflects a clear
separation of powers (currently being carried out) between the governors
who, as trustees of the public interest, authorise the BBC's strategy and
aims, and the management, which is responsible for their execution. And it
does not recognise that the performance indicators being put in place are
more comprehensive and sophisticated than mere audience measurement.
Instead it takes the view that we can top and tail a utility regulator and
add the word 'broadcasting' to the title. But there is more to public
service broadcasting than regulator and client, consumer and supplier. There
is more to the BBC than just broadcasting; it is a patron of the arts, a
cultural entertainer. There is more to trusteeship than regulation. BBC
governors are there to protect not the interests of a particular group of
shareholders but those of the public as a whole. They and the management
have a common interest in providing the range of services that will meet
that trust.
It is hard to see how some three-tiered system could secure even the minimum
necessary for compliance - still less to safeguard the BBC's independence
(admired around the world if not always at home) as the governors have done
for almost 70 years.

FT  03 AUG 93 / Letter: Lysold plan 'best possible' for ensuring a
sustainable future for Lloyd's
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DAVID SPRINGBETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, On July 23 you reported Peter Middleton, chief executive of Lloyd's,
being critical of me ('Names face writs to recover losses') for advising
Names to vote against a resolution supporting the present management, and
being sharply critical of improvements (involving Lysold plc) suggested for
Lloyd's business plan.
The EGM resolution contains several topics, including 'that the new
management of Lloyd's should be allowed the opportunity to implement the
Business Plan'. I, and my group, believe that the plan can be improved and,
as we are unhappy for it to be implemented on the present basis, we have
suggested a vote against the resolution. It is unfair of Peter Middleton to
interpret this as a vote against the present management, as Lysold wishes to
collaborate with him and his team.
The statement that the Lysold solution is 'commercially naive' is amazing.
Surely corporate capital investors must be regarded as 'commercially naive'
if they were to prefer the exposure in the Lloyd's plan to the security of
the Lysold barrier through the end of 1993. Corporate investors must
contribute 1.5 per cent to the central guarantee fund, and be exposed to
possible additional levies. Lysold proposes a further 1 per cent annual
charge with no exposure to the past or to any further levies, including
Lioncover (Cameron Webb), a liability that Lloyd's has not yet mentioned.
Lysold considers it impossible to run a successful Lloyd's with half the
membership involved in disputes. Lysold's proposed solutions involve the
creation of an insurance company, owned by Nantos and incorporating all its
reserves, operated under Department of Trade and Industry rules and not
under the absolute control of Lloyd's; a solution that the council cannot
suggest but which can be proposed by the Names. These solutions include
parameters for settling the litigation, closing open years, and providing a
fair and affordable exit route for any Name at the end of two years.
It is really sad that, after months of work and consultations with leading
City institutions, Peter Middleton should denigrate Lysold as naive and
unacceptable. Lysold is a constructive and workable solution to the massive
problems at Lloyd's.
Hopefully, Peter Middleton will yet see Lysold as the best possible
evolution of the Lloyd's business plan, and the implementation of Lysold
will result in a positive and sustainable future for Lloyd's. Support for
Lysold is growing and, unlike the Lloyd's business plan, the Lysold
suggestions are 'consultative'.

FT  03 AUG 93 / Arts: 'Cosi' and 'Zauberflote' - Salzburg Festival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In Salzburg, where Mozart's name figures on almost every street corner and
in almost every shop window, it is a brave festival director who attempts to
reinvigorate ways and means of Mozart opera production. Gerard Mortier,
Salzburg artistic director, is indeed a brave man, and in his short period
of office has already launched the attempt; but so far luck has not been
with him much of the way.
Ideas tend to be fixed here, even more than in most front-rank operatic
centres, by memories of 'classic' stagings and performers past. A new-look
Idomeneo a couple of years ago was not made welcome; and on opening night
the production team of this year's new Cos fan tutte - an opera about which
Salzburg festival-goers feel particularly proprietorial - got a frenzied
barracking, followed by mass rotten-egg lobbing in the German-speaking
press.
Debacle, flop and catastrophe were just some of their terms of abuse. The
whole enterprise was, it seems, born under the unluckiest of stars: one
producer (Luc Bondy) lost before work ever began and a second (Guy Joosten)
three weeks before opening night. The final choice, Erwin Piplits of the
celebrated Serapion Theatre in Vienna, had originally come on board as
Joosten's designer, and had himself never directed opera before. Tales of
troubled rehearsals were echoing well beyond city limits before the festival
began. And then Cecilia Bartoli, scheduled to make as Despina her
much-awaited Salzburg debut, caught laryngitis, to be replaced on opening
night by the sparky Elzbieta Szmytka.
In such circumstances the fair-minded British visitor longs to place himself
on the side of the underdog. Unfortunately, the show itself puts some fairly
formidable obstacles in his path. There is an intentionally dingy,
downmarket quality to the design (drab modern dress; movable screens bare or
else with scabbed paint-patches; a pair of MFI-style wooden tables and
chairs the only furniture).
The purpose, it seems, was to scrape from the opera its sunny-skied
upper-class-divertissement surface and analyse the potent, timeless
emotional currents beneath. This is not intrinsically an unworthy aim - and,
outside Salzburg, by no means an unfamiliar one. Here, however, the design
colours, motifs and stratagems are at once too unvaried, too ill-suited to
the awkwardly-shaped Kleines Festspielhaus stage, and far too poorly lit to
allow any chance of fulfilment.
Until the later parts of Act 2, in which the strengths of an attractive
young cast begin at last to register, the whole show seems of undergraduate
calibre: ineptly plotted, fitfully characterised, uncertainly motivated in
its search for novelty. Whether it is beyond rescue is a moot point - I
myself should need persuading at gun-point to sit through Act 1, as it
stands, a second time.
Certainly, though, there are basic musical strengths to build on. Christoph
von Dohnanyi's conducting of the Vienna Philharmonic is muscular yet
flexible, highly responsive to singers' demands, if sometimes distinctly
un-Mediterranean in temper. (Dohnanyi, not a favourite of the Salzburg
public, received an unjust share of the final-curtain boos.) And already
Jennifer Larmore (a spunky, rich-toned Dorabella), Bruce Ford (a serious,
impassioned, beautifully long-phrased Ferrando), Solveig Kringelbotn (an
inexperienced Fiordiligi of radiant potential), Jeffrey Black (a
firm-voiced, slightly bland Guglielmo) and Ferruccio Furlanetto (Alfonso)
have proved themselves worthy of the engagement.
More happily for Mortier, he has already one 'classic' Mozart staging of his
own to balance the books - the 1991 Zauberflote, now magically revived under
Bernard Haitink's superbly strong musical direction. People who know
Johannes Schaaf's views of Mozart only from those four sourly misanthropic
Covent Garden productions would find this show the most gratifying of
surprises. The location is reinvented - this is a South-East Asian Flute of
exotic detail yet strictly responsible scenic perspective, and it fills the
vast Grosses Festspielhaus stage as though creating a new world.
In Act 2 the move from the local to the eternal is judged with extraordinary
and moving acuity, yet the mood stays light. The cast, as youthfully fresh
as the Cos but far more rewardingly employed, is without weakness, led by
Deon van der Walt's manly Tamino, Rene Pape's magnificent Sarastro, Ruth
Ziesak's tender Pamina, Sumi Jo's gloriously unfettered Queen and - best of
all - a warm-voiced, adorably local-accented, Papageno from Anton
Scharinger. The Vienna Philharmonic and choir from the Vienna State Opera
help make this biggest of big-house Flutes one of the most intimate, and one
of the best.
Cos performances until August 7, Die Zauberflote until August 29

FT  03 AUG 93 / Arts: Beautiful Thing - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When people ask 'But where are the new plays?', there are several different
kinds of answer to give. But as good a reply as any is simply to say 'Try
the Bush.' The Bush Theatre, above the Bush Pub on the corner of Shepherds
Bush Green, has been in the forefront of presenting new drama for years now.
There are other places - eg the Royal Court  - whose new plays may be more
innovative in sheer writing and structure; but at the Bush (thanks to its
artistic director Dominic Dromgoole) there is a real house style, and a real
alertness to the way people live today. Play upon play there seems to be
tapped right into the way things are, and audiences lap up each show.
Watching Jonathan Harvey's new play, Beautiful Thing, you can feel how
easily its audience follows every current and allusion. Its action occurs in
a modern block of tiny flats in South East London, and - like several recent
Bush plays - it is mainly about adolescence. In particular, Beautiful Thing
is a story of homosexual love between two teenage boys in next-door flats,
but its most touching achievement is the gradual, oblique, funny, rounded
way that it leads up to this. These boys are just the youngest of the play's
five characters. What happens between them is affecting because you have
come to know them in context.
Jamie lives with his mother, Sandra, a barmaid currently dating Tony, the
latest in a line of boyfriends. Ste (the boy next door) lives with his
brother and their violent father, who frequently beats him. Jamie's other
next-door neighbour, Leah, is another teenager who leads a life of cheerful
boredom only lit up by her obsession with the life and songs of the late
Mama Cass. The walls are like paper. The play catches, very surely, the
numerous tolerances and intolerances that are the fabric of daily life on
any housing estate.
Jamie and Ste, who are the only characters who seem fully rounded from the
very start here, are excellently played by Mark Letheren and Jonny Lee
Miller. Body language, mastery of accent, facial expressions: all these are
used with such psychological accuracy that you hang on every tiny event as
if it were part of a thriller. (Just watch how often both boys avoid looking
each other straight in the eye in Act One; and how naturally they do so in
Act Two.)
There are weaknesses. The ending, charmingly sentimental, is too
rose-tinted. There could be yet more tension - and, later, more release -
between Jamie and his mother Sandra (Patricia Kerrigan); their big fight is
too obviously choreographed. Both Sandra and Leah look at first like
comedy-cartoon 'types' (sassy, quarrelsome, outspoken cockneys),but it is
part of Harvey's skill - part of his point - is that they turn out to be as
complex and troubled as Jamie and Ste.
Interestingly, Kerrigan's acting gets more relaxed as her part grows larger;
but Sophie Stanton, who acts Leah exactly as she acted in the Bush's last
play, cannot handle the element of despairing escapism that becomes more
startling as the play progresses. But the director, Hettie Macdonald, has
brought out so much truth from Harvey's play that any passing flaws are but
shadows. Like most of those about me, I followed the action with my heart in
my throat - and, while applauding, blinked back the odd tear.

FT  03 AUG 93 / Arts: Glimpses of another world - Lynn MacRitchie admires
the work of aboriginal artists at the Hayward
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LYNN MACRITCHIE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The resurgence of aboriginal art throughout Australia over the past 20 years
is nothing short of a triumph for a people who until as late as the 1960s
were believed to have been driven to the verge of extinction. The surviving
Koori, Murri, Nyungar, Nunga, Yolngu and Anangu people with their 300
languages and culture rooted in the religious significance of the land, are
now making considerable progress in their political and cultural endeavours.
The survival of aboriginal art, and, most importantly, the development by
the artists and their communities of ways of making it available to a
non-aboriginal audience both inside and increasingly beyond Australia, have
been crucial in this regeneration. Aratjara, now at the Hayward Gallery, is
the largest exhibition of aboriginal art ever to be seen in Europe.
Approaching such unfamiliar work always presents difficulties. Does one read
lots of books beforehand and go in armed with theory or just plunge ahead
and hope for the best? I opted for the latter, making my first circuit
guided only by my own eyes. Just looking, several features were immediately
obvious - the stylistic differences between various regions, and a much
wider range of subjects and styles than expected. It also ensured that
initial 'judgment' of the work was, as in any other gallery context, made on
the basis of contemplating its form, composition and colour.
There were surprises - the large, brightly coloured canvas 'My Country',
1992, by Ginger Riley Munduwalawala outstanding in a room full of ochre and
brown cross hatched bark paintings by his fellow artists from Arnhem land,
or the politically charged paintings, screen prints and photographs from the
urban south east, stylistically familiar icons of an unfamiliar struggle.
In the rooms devoted to the art of the central and western desert, stylistic
progression began to become evident, as images obviously still based on
religious or ceremonial markings were painted first on composition board and
then on canvas. The last room is filled with enormous paintings which
although composed of signs and symbols 'readable' to those who know their
language also operate as superb examples of what we would term abstract art.
Although study is needed to appreciate the full meaning of the images or the
techniques used to create them, works such as the superb 'Jardiwarnpa
Jukurrpa' or 'Fire Dreaming' make a powerful impact even before the full
significance of the various elements of their composition is elucidated.
'Fire Dreaming', a communal work created by 21 women and seven men of the
Yuendumu community, was specially commissioned for the exhibition,and
presents a 'picture' of the community and its location, including its sacred
sites, painted in the brightly coloured dotted patterns now identified as
'western desert art'. By its use of carefully selected images from the
traditional ground or body paintings presented as a wall hung canvas, the
piece demonstrates the developments aboriginal artists have made both
formally in their work and in its mediation to the rest of the world.
What is most striking about the 'Fire Dreaming,' or about the work of Ginger
Riley or that of Rover Thomas Julama, one of two aboriginal artists who
represented Australia at the Venice Biennale of 1990, is the confidence and
strength of purpose of the artists. Using the expanded palette that acrylic
paints have made available to them, they have reinterpreted their
traditional themes specifically in order that they may be seen by
non-aboriginal eyes; the concept of 'outsiders' seeing the paintings is thus
inherent in their composition and execution.
Those who worry about 'authenticity' or that the artists somehow lose out by
showing in western style galleries or selling in the western style art
market which flourishes in Australia should calm their fears. It is just for
that market that these works have been adapted and created. And this is a
good thing; it means that the aboriginal artists are in control. The images
which they trade have been created for that purpose, passed by their elders
and ritual guardians as appropriate for strangers' eyes. Other, secret,
images continue to be used for traditional religious purposes.
These works designed for us still offer a glimpse into another world, where
artists and their communities share a dynamic relation to their creation
myths, the representation and observance of which gives purpose and meaning
to their lives, and now also provides a useful tool to help redress the
balance against the incoming society which has been dominant for 200 years.
The creation of 'Fire Dreaming' was accompanied by 'Big dancing ceremony,
men, women, girls . . . really big business,' according to Dolly Daniels,
one of the artists who worked on it.
These remarkable pictures command respect, both for their beauty and
sophisticated combination of the assumptions of our opposing cultures,
permitting a glimpse of an ancient way of life our own ancestors tried so
hard, but thankfully so unsuccessfully, to destroy.

FT  03 AUG 93 / Arts: Handel's 'Deborah' - Concert
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There is always an audience for the little-known works of well-known
composers. While a record company knows it may struggle to find buyers for
unfamiliar composers from Albeniz to Zemlinsky, there will be no trouble if
the disc has Mozart or Handel on the label.
Even today there remain a few large-scale works by Handel that await
successful recordings. The King's Consort recently performed and recorded
the opera Ottone. Now it has turned its attention to the equally obscure
Deborah, an oratorio. Obscure, but not unfamiliar. Handel, always ready to
borrow from music he had written earlier, outdid himself in this score and
whole sections from other previous works keep surfacing.
Deborah is a patchwork oratorio, expertly sewn together, the new positioning
of choruses and arias often as good as the old. It won popular acclaim when
it was first performed in 1733 and a fairly warm reception at the Proms on
Sunday. With over 100 singers and instrumentalists taking part in the
premiere it was the magnificence of the music which impressed early
audiences ('tis excessively noisy', wrote one commentator).
Robert King added to that 100, topping up the choral numbers. In Handel's
day the figures for choirs always look small against the instrumentalists to
the extent that one wonders how the balance can have worked. King combined
the Choir of New College, Oxford, with boy choristers from Salisbury
Cathedral and was rewarded with some of the best choral singing that his
group has had - a firm, decisive, sparkling ensemble.
This was all to the good, as the choral sections are among Deborah's most
striking moments. Choruses of Israelites are pitted against the Priests of
Baal, rivalling each other with exhortations to war, for which the King's
Consort armed itself with more rhythmic punch than the conductor usually
delivers.
The heroine Jael, who seduces the enemy commander and nails his head to the
ground with a tent peg, does not get very bloodthirsty music, but Susan
Gritton endeavoured to give her some character. Yvonne Kenny was the
prophetess Deborah and Michael George the bass Abinoam, both singing well
but in need of more personality. James Bowman is fully at home with the
Handelian style and commanded the music of Barak with easy nonchalance. The
vocal decorations generally sounded as if they might have been improvised,
but they added little of worth. Surely singers in Handel's day would have
wanted to show off more?

FT  03 AUG 93 / Business and the Law: Ruling on PVC overturned - European
Court
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
In an opinion of the European Court of Justice, Advocate-General Walter Van
Gerven says the judgment of the Court of First Instance in a case concerning
polyvinylchloride should be set aside. The case should be sent back to the
CFI for outstanding issues to be dealt with.
The case concerned a Commission decision to fine certain companies for
anti-competitive behaviour in the supply of PVC. The companies applied to
the court to have the decision annulled.
The CFI found that the decision was non-existent in that there had been a
manifest breach of the principle of 'inalterability of the measure adopted',
that the decision was not authenticated and that the member of the
Commission responsible for competition matters who signed the decision did
not have the competence to do so. The Commission appealed to the European
Court.
The advocate-general first rejected a claim by the companies that the
Commission had not lodged its appeal in time and that it should not
therefore be heard. He then dealt with the issue that changes had been made
to the decision in between the time when it was adopted by the collegiate
body of Commissioners and the time when it was notified to the companies.
The CFI had ruled that the fact that the changes were more than mere
spelling or grammar amendments meant that the principle that a measure
adopted by the Commission could not be altered - the 'inalterability'
principle - had been breached.
The advocate-general said that the CFI had used the wrong test in making its
decision on this point. Instead of examining the extent of the changes made,
the CFI should have examined the effect of those changes on the companies
and whether the changes had materially affected their understanding of the
Commission's decision against them, and thus whether their legal position
had been adversely affected. The CFI's findings on this point, therefore,
were struck down by the ECJ.
The advocate-general moved to the issue of authentication. The problem arose
in the context of the fact the decision was authentic in five official
language versions. The full Commission had adopted the final decision in
three of those versions - English, French and German - but had left the
commissioner for competition to adopt the other two remaining versions,
namely Dutch and Italian.
The CFI had ruled that the Commission had no power to delegate the right of
adoption; and that only the Commission could adopt authentic texts. The
advocate-general disagreed. He said it was permissible for the Commission to
delegate to a commissioner the power to adopt the text of a decision which
had already been adopted by the full Commission in another language version.
Essentially, the task entrusted to the commissioner was one of practical
execution or internal organisation, capable of being delegated.
As to whether each decision adopted by the Commission should be signed by
the president and secretary-general of the Commission, the advocate-general
found that, although the Commission had breached its own internal procedural
rules in this instance, the breach was not such as to nullify the decision
in question.
This was because the president and the secretary-general had signed the
minutes of the meeting at which the decision in question had been adopted by
the full Commission, and that, as the minutes accurately reflected the
contents of the decision, the rights of the companies concerned - that the
decision as notified to them individually corresponded to the decision taken
by the Commission - had not been breached.
Finally, the advocate-general found that the fact that the decisions
individually notified to the companies concerned had not been signed by the
commissioner for competition was irrelevant. The decision had clearly been
adopted by the full Commission and its legal effects were not hindered by
lack of a signature.

Van Gerven, June 29 1993.

FT  03 AUG 93 / Business and the Law: Redress for a grievance - How some
employees gained access to pension funds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As the Goode Committee continues its review of pensions law in the light of
the Robert Maxwell affair, the ability of pension fund members to pursue
their grievances through the courts received a considerable boost last week.
The High Court confirmed an order giving members of two funds run by Melton
Medes, an unquoted Nottingham-based conglomerate, the right to use pension
fund monies to pay their legal costs so as to enable them to continue their
action against the pension funds' trustees, Mr Nathu Ram Puri, the Melton
Medes chairman, and Mr James Philpotts, its chief executive.
This is the first time such an order has been made by the courts. It
provides a very important means of safeguarding the rights of the members of
pension funds that are controlled by their employers, according to Mr Sean
Hand, a partner of the solicitors acting for the pension fund members, Dibb
Lupton Broomhead.
Allowing pension fund members to use the fund to finance legal action
against the trustees 'could go a long way to meeting the greatest inadequacy
of current pension scheme regulation, namely, the inability of beneficiaries
to obtain redress for their grievances', he says.
Company law went through a similar process over the right of minority
shareholders to be indemnified by the company against the costs of any legal
action brought on its behalf, he says. That right was enshrined in statute
law by the 1980 Companies Act.
'Maybe it is time that pension fund members were given a similar statutory
right to be indemnified by their funds. The Goode Committee should take
note,' he adds.
The Melton Medes saga began in 1986 when Robert Fletcher (Greenfield) and
Robert Fletcher (Stoneclough), two paper mills previously owned by the
Imperial Group, were sold to a subsidiary of Melton Medes.
Shortly after the sale went through, the new trustees of the funds, Mr Puri
and Mr Philpotts, sanctioned a Pounds 4m loan from the two funds to the
parent company at an interest rate of only 2 per cent. The loan was secured
by a second charge on freehold properties of the Robert Fletcher mills which
had already been charged to Lloyd's Bank.
When employees discovered that pension fund money had been used to finance
an inadequately secured loan to Melton Medes at an uncommercial rate of
interest, they became very concerned about possible losses to the fund.
But their concern turned to alarm when the loan was repaid, not in cash, but
in a transfer of shares from Melton Medes in two small quoted companies,
Delaney Group and Marling Industries, in which Mr Puri's companies had large
stakes. Indeed, Mr Puri was chairman of and had a controlling interest in
Delaney.
Since the transfer, the shares in both companies have plummeted by more than
half.
In March 1992, the plaintiffs, seven members of the pension funds, decided
to sue for breach of trust both in relation to the Pounds 4m loan and the
transfer of the shares.
The launch of the main action was followed four months later by a second
action seeking disclosure of certain documents to the plaintiffs as
beneficiaries of the funds, the appointment of judicial trustees, and an
order to prevent further dissipation of the funds, pending the hearing of
the main action.
Both actions were originally funded by the plaintiffs' union, the Graphical
Paper and Media Union (GPMU). But when it became apparent that the costs of
a long, drawn-out court battle would be too great to expect other members of
the union to fund, the GPMU withdrew.
In January this year the plaintiffs applied to Mr Justice Vinelott for an
order that the costs of the actions should be paid out of the pension funds,
at least until the defendants had handed over the documents requested and
they had had time to inspect them.
Mr Justice Vinelott was originally against granting such an order on the
basis that it might be possible for the two sides to reach a compromise on
the appointment of new trustees who could then take up the members'
grievances.
In March, however, the position was further complicated by the launch of a
parallel action against Mr Puri and Mr Philpotts by the Securities and
Investments Board, alleging breach of the Investment Management Regulatory
Organisation's rules in relation to the original Pounds 4m loan.
Negotiation between the two sides failed. Mr Justice Vinelott confirmed in a
judgment given last week that he would grant the plaintiffs the pre-emptive
costs order and appoint Mr Neil Cooper and Mr Ipe Jacob, partners in
accountants Robson Rhodes, as judicial trustees of the funds.
The judge said that what the plaintiffs were seeking was an order that as
representative beneficiaries, they should be entitled to pursue the claims
on behalf of the trust estate and be entitled to the same order to which
they would have been entitled if they had been trustees acting with the
authority of the court.
There is clear authority, he said, for the courts to allow trustees who wish
to protect themselves from possible personal liability for the costs of
prosecuting or defending proceedings to fund those proceedings at the
expense of their trust funds.
Mr Justice Vinelott then drew a distinction between conventional trust funds
and pension funds.
'In the case of a pension fund, unlike a conventional trust fund, the
beneficiaries have themselves contributed both in cash and in service to the
employer,' he said.
'They are entitled to be satisfied that the trust fund to which they have
contributed is administered in a way which reflects their legitimate
expectations by trustees in which they have full confidence.'
This is a new and very important statement of the law, according to Mr Hand.
'It appears to be heading towards saying pension fund trustees must be
accountable to their beneficiaries,' he said.
The judge then went on to say that he intended to grant the plaintiff's
application for the appointment of judicial trustees because it was unjust
in the context of a pension fund, that the administration of funds to which
members had contributed and which required the continual exercise of
discretion, 'should be left in the hands of persons in whose fairness and
probity the beneficiaries no longer have confidence'.
The uniqueness of this decision lies not so much in the costs order itself,
says Mr Hand, but in the mechanism the judge used to resolve the problem -
combining the granting of the costs order with the appointment of judicial
trustees.
In a conventional trust, this type of order would be impossible, he adds.
The court would never remove existing trustees and substitute judicial
trustees until the substantive case had been argued.
But the judge made it clear that different principles should apply in the
case of pension funds. Mr Hand said the main action could now go ahead.

FT  03 AUG 93 / Technology: Speed is of the essence - A look at companies
which have flourished with the help of instant data
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If you want to shop with comfort in the US these days, just pick up the
telephone and talk to Tootie. She will take your order, agree on the method
of payment, and tell the warehouse to send off your product.
Tootie is not human. She is the recorded voice that answers consumers
contacting Home Shopping Network, the main player in the Dollars 2bn (Pounds
1.3bn) business of electronic shopping, while watching one of the company's
television sales promotions.
Not everyone, however, likes dealing with a recorded voice, even one whose
responses have been programmed to match the goods on offer. A live operator
will come on if the caller does not speak to Tootie within five seconds.
Florida-based HSN, which collects a massive array of near-instant
computerised data on its sales and financial performance, is a prime example
of how information technology can make life easier for companies and
organisations, as well as their customers. With IT costs falling rapidly and
hard-pressed computer companies pushing deeper into the services and
software market, users can take their pick of technology to suit their
needs, though they may not always make the appropriate choice.
Not only can this lead to faster and more reliable service for consumers and
in public services, it also provides information of strategic value for
enhancing efficiency, giving businesses new insights about their performance
or lack of it, and streamlining their marketing activities.
Whether people like the idea of shopping from home or not, electronic
retailing is an impressive demonstration of what can be achieved with IT.
But there are plenty of more mundane ones. In the Netherlands, for example,
the telephone company (Royal Dutch PTT Telecom) is refining the process of
ordering a line connection to a minimum.
In one short visit to a Dutch PTT office, the customer can obtain a new
number, a telephone contract, and the precise time of a connection within
two days instead of the two weeks this used to take; by 1995, connections
should be instantaneous.
What the Dutch PTT did was channel the information from its mainframe
computers - including equipment from IBM, Digital Equipment, Unisys and
Olivetti - to individual terminals in the sales offices. Thus sales staff
have all necessary operational details about debtors, lines, payment
methods, and other aspects of the business at their fingertips.
Modern IT methods have enabled the privatised Dutch PTT, most of whose
exchanges are computerised, to put this data from several different systems
together instead of requiring employees to switch between software programs
on the same screen. This has cut errors and speeded up service. A big
stimulus to its technological push was the need to raise efficiency ahead of
the time when its monopoly status is reconsidered in two years.
The technology for this and other applications is not brand new, says Merlin
Stone, visiting professor at Kingston University in the UK and a partner in
Avanti Consultancy Services. But it has become much cheaper and better
understood as computer companies have been forced by fierce competitive
pressures to concentrate more on finding solutions for customers' needs and
less on selling their own hardware.
'In some areas, the technology enables companies to do things they couldn't
do before,' explains Stone. Advanced software and computer networks mean
that HSN, whose smaller rival QVC Network has proposed a merger, can not
only process orders rapidly and automatically, but also provide an
immediate, accurate and comprehensive picture of how goods are selling.
HSN's data is updated every 10 seconds so the hosts of its TV 'infomercials'
can see on a computer screen exactly how well the products on offer are
selling. If they are moving slower than usual for the time of day or type of
product, the host and producer can switch immediately to another line or
promotional pitch. They are also kept up to date with inventory levels and
told whether products are running out. Thus HSN, which developed its own
software, can monitor its sales progress in 'dollars per minute', says
Stella Tavilla, executive vice-president for management information systems.
At management level, this volume of product-tracking data is used to
influence reordering and assist in marketing strategies, since HSN has full
details of purchasers' names and addresses. 'There's no doubt,' adds Stone,
'that in the direct marketing area, the ability to build a database on
millions of customers, and process the information on-line and respond to
it, has made a difference to what they can do.'
This is a result of the sheer processing power and speed of today's computer
equipment. A new study, initial results of which were presented at a
conference in Nice, southern France, says companies are increasingly keen to
use IT to improve service, and thus their competitive and financial
position, while public service bodies want to respond more effectively to
people's needs, sometimes under legislative pressures.
'Perhaps the most striking conclusion is that most large organisations are
now seeing IT as one of the most important bridges to enhancing customer
service,' the report's authors, headed by Stone, state. 'They now rarely see
customer service as having separate components, such as marketing, selling,
after-sales service and invoicing, each with their own system.'
At the conference, organised by Unisys, the US computer group which
sponsored the study, Stone said the UK was often 10 years behind the US in
marketing. Companies like HSN, with its single-minded focus on a few
performance indicators and its attention on 'dollars per minute', showed
what could be achieved with effective use of IT.
Nowhere is speed of service more important than in the fast-food industry.
The UK operation of McDonald's, the US hamburger chain, is applying IT to
improve and accelerate information flows between its restaurants and the
London head office. As it upgrades point-of-sale equipment in its outlets,
it can use POS data to pinpoint exactly where delays have been occurring, at
what times of day, and why.
Previously, the UK company's performance indicators were based on averages
for each store. 'The fact that we serve one customer very well, or maybe
even 10 customers very well, and one very poorly could be masked in that
average,' says Dan Fishman, assistant vice-president, information services.
We need to be able to get away from that.'
Fishman sees exciting possibilities in drive-in restaurants, more of which
are being built in Britain, and remote ordering of fast-food meals. Queues
in drive-ins can cause havoc at busy times. So, with the help of detailed
data from its IT installations, McDonald's will track transactions to find
the source of delays and decide how to tackle these.
Eventually, he hopes, customers will be able to order meals from office
computers, using cheap software, or tap in their request at a special
machine before entering, say, a shopping mall containing a McDonald's.
Not everyone likes McDonald's food, and shopping HSN-style in front of the
TV is still only a minority form of retailing in the US. But, the activities
of these and other companies show the extent to which the intelligent
application of computer technology is changing both business and customer
attitudes.
The IT companies are certainly being swept along by the change. With
economic growth in western economies expected to be plodding rather than
brisk in the next few years, users are increasingly calling the tune. By
1997, when the world IT market is expected to reach around Dollars 700bn,
services and software are forecast to account for 60 per cent against just
over half at present.
Customers now want more than the promise of ever faster and more powerful
equipment, says John Perry, head of Unisys in the UK. They expect to be
helped to use their IT systems more effectively, and that means more
business in consultancy and less in hardware. 'We think it's going to be a
decade of battling for the customer.'

FT  03 AUG 93 / Technology: Sealed with innovation - Advances at an Austrian
group are helping industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is difficult even for engineers to get excited about seals, the rubber or
plastic rings that are fitted at joints in fluid pipes to prevent leakage.
But this is a business with a Dollars 4bn (Pounds 2.6bn) annual worldwide
turnover and vital to the functioning of most industrial machinery.
It is now being shaken up by a small Austrian company, Economos, that has
achieved an impressive series of innovations in materials and production
technologies and distribution methods.
There are thousands of seal types and sizes, and customers expect their
distributors to keep stocks available of most of them. Seal makers, too, put
pressure on distributors to buy large stocks. This is because their
production technology and injection moulding encourages them to make large
batches.
In the mid-1980s, Helmut Mayerhofer, founder of Economos, and his associates
began investigating the possibility of developing compounds that could be
machined on a numerically controlled lathe. When an order came in for a
small quantity of an item not in stock, they could simply take a rough block
of polyurethane or synthetic rubber and turn the required few pieces.
The problem was that few existing polyurethane compounds could be machined
and those that could were not flexible enough to make suitable seals.
They approached the Department of Material Science and Material Testing of
the Mining University of Leoben in Styria in 1988 for help, and within a
year a formula was found that would produce a machinable polyurethane
material suitable for seals.
Meanwhile, Economos, working with a plastic machine maker, developed a
process for extruding the material into rough seal moulds - which resemble
lengths of pipe - in industrial quantities.
The challenge in producing material for seals and extruding it into rough
shapes is that the finished product must have highly consistent elastic
properties and be free of bubbles. Achieving these aims becomes more
difficult as the desired diameter of the seal increases.
The company's third innovation was the development of a lathe, cutting tools
and software for machining the rough stock into precisely dimensioned seals.
Economos considers these developments to be so valuable that it does not
allow any employee to learn both the chemical and production aspects of the
technology. Moreover, it has not taken out patents, fearing that competitors
would quickly find ways of getting around them.
An unexpected benefit came as a result of the speed and degree of automation
of the company's lathe. It can machine a seal in about a minute, slice it
off the rough stock and immediately machine another from remaining stock.
This meant the system could be applied more widely than originally
anticipated. Economos can use it to produce normal volumes as well as
occasional seals.
Since production could be done in response to orders, why not set up for
business as close to the customers as possible? Under that model,
distributors would no longer need to carry large stocks, making possible
lower prices and higher margins. Machinery producers might even be tempted
to abandon the stocking and supply of replacement seals.
In the past two years, Economos has set up, together with local partners,
what might be termed seal service centres worldwide. Economos supplies the
rough blocks of material and the lathes, while the local entrepreneur, under
a franchise agreement, machines and delivers seals in response to orders. So
far, there are 250 such centres operating with the brand name Seal-Jet.
Ernst Stocker, Economos managing director, estimates their combined annual
sales at about Dollars 120m.
Economos had revenues last year of Sch420m (Pounds 23m) almost all of it
from selling machines and materials. It is now revising its strategy to gain
greater control of the seal service businesses outside Austria.

FT  03 AUG 93 / Business and the Law: Legal auditor damaged client
relationship - Legal Briefs
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The trend in the US towards companies employing independent legal auditors
to vet their law firm bills may be reined back by a legal action which has
been launched by a Los Angeles law firm claiming a legal auditor
irretrievably damaged a 20-year relationship with a valued client. Allen
Rhodes &amp; Sobelsohn is suing Mr Bruce Bealke of Legal Audits Inc of St Louis
for Dollars 3m in economic damages plus punitive damages for defamation and
interference with business after he 'erroneously' misconstrued the firms
charging rate for client ITT Hartford Insurance. Allen Rhodes claims that
the auditor's comments led prospective clients and even judges to inquire
about rumours that the firm had been indicted for fraud; was intending to
file for bankruptcy; had laid off 17 lawyers; and was being sued by Hartford
for several million dollars.
Important changes to the law covering goods bought in bulk have been put
forward by the law commissions in England and Scotland. Under existing law a
person who buys a specified quantity of goods forming part of an
unidentified bulk - say 100 tonnes of wheat stored in a warehouse containing
a much larger quantity - will not actually own the goods until they have
been ascertained which is normally not until delivery. The thinking behind
this is that a person cannot own something until they know precisely what it
is. Although logical this causes problems for commodity traders in
particular. The commissions recommend in future that buyers should be able
to become owner not of particular grains of wheat but of a proportionate
part of the bulk corresponding to the quantity bought and paid for. A
solution of this type has been in operation in the US since 1906.

FT  03 AUG 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Planning your future
together - A closer relationship with customers can bring benefits to both
sides
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hunter Plastics, a manufacturer of pipes and guttering, thought it knew what
its customers wanted. But market research came up with some unexpected
answers and set the company off on a quest to really get to know its
customers.
'That research was our Rubicon,' says Chris Nunn, managing director of the
south London company, which has turnover of Pounds 15m and 200 employees.
'We thought that price and quality would be at the top of the list. It
turned out that customers wanted service and profits. They are related but
different.'
Hunter's customers - mostly builders merchants - were looking for products
promoted and priced so as to leave them a satisfactory profit margin. They
wanted the products delivered at convenient times, in handy quantities with
a minimum of hassle.
As a result, Hunter has spent the past three years working much more closely
with its customers. Buyers have been invited to Hunter's factory to meet
staff in production, stores and quality assurance, not just sales. Customers
have been visited to discuss their requirements and products, such as a new
line of guttering, have been developed.
Better ways of running the business have been discussed and Hunter has
replaced its cumbersome, labour-intensive method of processing orders with a
computerised system. Closer links with certain customers have led to Hunter
becoming the single source for some supplies.
Nunn says the closer relationship with customers has developed naturally.
But the strategy - known as partnership sourcing - has been growing in
popularity around the world in recent years. In the UK the Department of
Trade and Industry and the Confederation of British Industry have
established a joint venture, called Partnership Sourcing, to promote the
concept.
Hunter was somewhat unusual in suggesting the partnership idea. In other
cases of partnership sourcing the impetus has usually come from large
companies buying from smaller suppliers. IBM UK, Nissan and British Airways
are among the large purchasing organisations featured in one explanatory
Partnership Sourcing booklet*.
Not surprisingly, suppliers used to the traditional adversarial relationship
with buyers have often reacted cautiously to the idea. 'If a buyer has been
aggressive for years and then suddenly wants to give you a cuddle there is
bound to be some initial suspicion,' comments Norman Hosford, deputy
director of Partnership Sourcing.
Adapting to relationships based on partnership requires considerable change
on the part of both suppliers and purchasers. Companies that commit
themselves to a single source of supply run the risk that the supplier could
be hit by a strike, go bust or attempt to push up prices.
Suppliers that become overdependent on one large customer, or who reveal too
much about the details of their business, might also be making themselves
vulnerable.
What has brought the two sides together in a growing number of instances is
the realisation that hard-nosed confrontation, based on price alone,
benefits neither side.
'If price is everything, the time comes when the law of diminishing returns
begins to apply,' says Malcolm Diamond, managing director of TR Fastenings.
TR, based in Uckfield, East Sussex, with sales of Pounds 27m and a workforce
of 400, was introduced to the idea of partnership sourcing by a DTI
initiative.
'You reach the point where savings don't reflect the time involved,' Diamond
says. 'When there is nothing else to grab then something else will go wrong
 -deliveries will be late or quality will be poor or inconsistent.'
Contacting potential suppliers, sifting through the quotes and selecting the
cheapest products from a number of companies is enormously time consuming,
Diamond says. It can lead to uneven quality and create an administrative
jungle.
For basic products such as the nuts and bolts supplied by TR, 80 per cent of
the cost to the purchaser goes into handling deliveries, breaking up bulk
consignments and getting them to the right place in the production line.
For those customers with which TR has reached partnership sourcing
agreements - accounting for 30 per cent of the company's turnover -
deliveries are made direct to the production line without the need to count
or check them for quality.
One customer, Worcester Controls, bought more than 800 items at a cost of
Pounds 200,000 a year from TR. But 35 items accounted for Pounds 130,000 of
the total and involved more than 400 deliveries a month. Each delivery could
take up to two weeks to pass through the goods-in and inspection departments
before it was available for use.
TR's delivery driver now stocks up these 35 items himself with one delivery
note per delivery and one invoice each month.
Adapting to partnership sourcing does not require sophisticated systems but
it does require a change in attitudes on the part of both partners, comments
Hosford. Very few partnership sourcing arrangements involve written
agreements so they depend to a great degree on trust.
Suppliers and purchasers must invest a lot of time and effort in
establishing new procedures. In practice they will only do this with
companies they have dealt with for many years.
'It is difficult discussing problems with a customer,' says Chris Nunn. 'But
if something is going wrong in production or delivery it is better for the
customer to know. That is the way a long-term relationship builds up.'
Once a supplier can count on such a relationship it is in a better position
to make long-term investment plans, says John Edser, managing director of
Hatfield-based Applied Digital Devices (ADD), which repairs computer
equipment for ICL and others. ICL accounts for half of ADD's Pounds 2m
turnover.
ADD, which is one of more than 180 partnership suppliers signed up for ICL's
vendor accreditation programme, has received help in bringing its quality
assurance system up to ISO9000 standard. It has also been encouraged to
adopt electronic data interchange (EDI), a paperless method of exchanging
orders, and qualify for Investors in People, a government-backed scheme to
improve workforce skills.
Implementing such new procedures can place enormous pressure on suppliers -
ADD has not found it easy changing over to EDI - but it does give a small
company access to skills and systems that help it deal with other customers.
'It gives us a competitive edge in the market place and services we can
offer to other customers,' Edser says.
In theory, partnership sourcing can lead to such close contacts between the
two companies involved that the supplier opens his books to the customer.
The idea is that this openness allows the customer to see where further cost
savings could be made and overcome any fear that the single source supplier
is overcharging.
In practice open-book accounting has proved extremely controversial and has
yet to be implemented by many companies.
'The idea has been raised by a few customers but I would regard it as a
little high-handed,' comments Diamond. 'I don't mind showing people my
management accounts if they really need them. But I have a certain distaste
for the idea. You don't go into a restaurant and ask to look at the kitchen.
Anyway production costs can change from month to month.'
ADD does not give ICL access to its accounts, though it was asked to do so a
few years ago. But ICL does use its partnership sourcing arrangement to
maintain tight controls on costs. It expects cost reductions in return for
putting more business ADD's way, explains Edser. He calculates that prices
have been reduced in three of the past five years and held steady in the
other two. The supplier benefits by being able to spread his overhead costs
over a bigger volume of business.
Partnership sourcing may represent a move away from traditionally
adversarial relationships between suppliers and purchasers but it is not a
cosy alternative, says Hosford. 'It requires a large investment up-front and
continuous, close monitoring. It is not an easy option.'

FT  03 AUG 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Investors sought for city
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Plans for a Pounds 3m local investment fund to finance community enterprises
in deprived inner-city areas have been announced by Business in the
Community (BiTC), which co-ordinates business support activities.
The Department of the Environment has promised Pounds 1m if corporate
investors can be found to provide Pounds 2m. If the money can be raised the
fund hopes to back about a dozen community projects in the north-west of
England.
Community enterprises are businesses with a social purpose such as the North
Kensington Amenity Trust, which has developed wasteland beneath a raised
motorway in west London, and Cruddas Park Community Trust, which has helped
revitalise a housing estate in Newcastle upon Tyne. The projects must be in
Urban Priority Areas.
'We want to show investors that they can reap a profit from investments
which most people don't see as paying back,' said Graham Bann, director of
the investment fund.
Models for the idea are ventures such as the South Shore Bank, which has
revitalised a run-down area of Chicago, and Triodos Bank, an ethical
investment bank in the Netherlands. Different banking laws have meant that
the project has been set up as a fund in the UK.
South Shore Bank made a loss provision of 0.8 per cent of the loan portfolio
in 1991, while Triodos made a provision of 1.6 per cent, so properly
monitored investments can be an acceptable lending risk, BiTC said.
If the first Pounds 3m 'pilot' fund is successful BiTC plans to raise a
larger second-stage fund. Minimum investment in the pilot fund will be
Pounds 50,000 so it will appeal mainly to corporate investors.
The second fund, if it goes ahead, is expected to call upon deposit-taking
institutions, companies and wealthy private individuals.

FT  03 AUG 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Radical proposal for
loans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Further radical changes in the government's loan guarantee scheme are needed
if it is to be of maximum benefit to businesses recovering from the
recession.
This suggestion is made in a new study* by the Small Business Bureau, a
Conservative party lobby group. The report comes within weeks of changes
intended to make the scheme more useful.
The scheme provides a government guarantee on loans to viable businesses
that lack either a track record or security. On July 1 the government
increased the maximum loan from Pounds 100,000 to Pounds 250,000 and the
guarantee from 70 to 85 per cent.
The bureau suggests:
Make the scheme available to larger businesses. The recent increase in the
maximum size of the loan was not accompanied by an increase in the size of
eligible businesses.
Simplify the complex eligibility rules. At present manufacturing companies
must have a turnover of less than Pounds 3m, construction companies must
have fewer than 25 employees and road transport companies must have fewer
than five vehicles.
The bureau wants a two-tier scheme. Loans up to Pounds 100,000 would be
available to businesses less than two years old with up to 50 employees and
sales of Pounds 3m. Loans of up to Pounds 250,000 would be available to
businesses of any age that have up to 125 employees and Pounds 7.5m of
sales.
Publish a more helpful explanatory booklet.
The present booklet makes qualifying for a loan appear too easy while a
separate supplement, not always provided with the booklet, sets out the
numerous restrictions.
Start a debate about the possibility of requiring borrowers to show either
that they have business experience or that they have had training.

THE reluctance of UK companies to invest in eastern Europe has deepened
during a recession which has led a third of UK companies to reduce their
overall overseas investment, a study by Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the accountants
and management consultants, has found.
A total of 66 per cent of a sample of 100 UK companies from the FT Top 500
expressed an interest in investing in central and eastern Europe. This
compares with with 88 per cent in a similar survey two years ago.
A third said they would not even consider investing in the former Soviet
Union.

FT  03 AUG 93 / Home loans pick up as values rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM KING and ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FURTHER evidence of increased activity in the UK housing market emerged
yesterday with figures showing that borrowing by house-buyers is picking up
and house prices are continuing their slow rise.
The Council of Mortgage Lenders said gross mortgage advances rose to Pounds
13.5bn in the second quarter of this year from Pounds 10.9bn in the first
quarter. Net new lending rose to Pounds 4.1bn, up from Pounds 2.9bn in the
first quarter.
Nationwide Building Society's house price index rose for the fifth
consecutive month in July, rising 0.7 per cent on June. Nationwide said
prices had risen 4.3 per cent since the end of 1992, but were still 2.4 per
cent lower than last July.
The council's figures showed that mortgage balances at the end of June were
Pounds 347bn, almost 5 per cent higher than at the end of June last year.
The number of loans approved was 274,000, up more than 25 per cent on the
previous quarter and the highest figure for two years.
Mr Adrian Coles, the council's director-general, said the figures were 'very
encouraging' and confirmation that the market was slowly recovering.
He said the increase in the number and value of mortgage approvals
corroborated signs that confidence was returning. Mortgage approvals were up
10 per cent on the same period last year even though the 1991 figures had
been 'artificially boosted' by the deadline for the stamp-duty holiday.
At Nationwide, Mr Brian Davis, operations director, said: 'The modest
recovery . . . appears to be continuing.' He noted that the increase in
prices was supported by a small rise in the number of houses sold.
Nationwide said that by the end of the year prices are likely to record
modest gains over December 1992 - provided that the increase in activity is
sustained. The average UK house price was Pounds 54,103 in July, up Pounds
393 on June.
Nationwide's monthly index, based at 100 in the first quarter of 1983, stood
at just under 200 in July last year, but fell in the late summer and autumn
before picking up in January. After reaching a low point in February of
186.77, it has recovered to 195.13 in July.

FT  03 AUG 93 / Radical Tories urge benefits overhaul
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ABOLITION of the state earnings-related pension scheme and retirement at 67
for men and women are among radical changes recommended today by the
Thatcherite No Turning Back group of Tory MPs.
They advocate the progressive privatisation of the existing 'pay as you go'
national insurance system to encourage personal insurance and pension
provision.
Ending child benefit through the reintroduction of child tax allowances is
also proposed in a package which the group says is aimed at concentrating
resources on those most in need.
Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, who is conducting a review of
existing benefits to establish whether their cost is likely to undermine the
economy in the years ahead, is a member of the group.
Other proposals outlined in a pamphlet by five backbench members of the
group include:
Integration of non-contributory benefits into a single 'whole-person'
benefit, paid at different levels according to individual circumstances.
The new benefit to be subject to a system designed to encourage claimants to
move 'into earnings' yielding a genuine increase in their income.
Entitlement to unemployment benefit to be reduced from one year to six
months.
Retirement age for women to be raised, initially from 60 to 65 - to bring
them into line with men - with 67 eventually becoming the common retirement
age.
Invalidity benefit to be subject to income tax, and the earnings-related
element to be phased out.
Abolition of tax relief on mortgage interest and the ending of rent rebates
and rent allowances.
None of the proposals would affect existing pensioners or those approaching
retirement.
Mr Donald Dewar, Labour's shadow social security secretary, dismissed the
proposals as a 'clutter of ill-digested ideas' and called on Mr Lilley to
disown them.
The authors of the pamphlet are: Mr Alan Duncan (Rutland and Melton), Mr
Iain Duncan-Smith (Chingford), Mr Bernard Jenkin (North Colchester), Mr
Barry Legg (Milton Keynes south west) and Mr John Whittingdale (south
Colchester and Maldon).

FT  03 AUG 93 / Upturn forecast for construction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE construction industry should see an upturn in the second half of this
year after three years of recession, according to the National Council of
Building Materials Producers.
But the improved outlook depends on the government maintaining public-sector
investment at present levels, the council said yesterday. The recovery in
private-sector activity was 'extremely fragile' and limited to new house
construction.
Overall construction output is forecast to decline by 1.5 per cent in 1993
to Pounds 29.6bn - after a 5.5 per cent decline last year - in spite of the
prospects for improvement in the second half.
The pace of recovery in 1994 and 1995 will be slow, says the council, with 1
per cent growth next year followed by a 2 per cent rise in 1995.
The council says that significant orders for new public non-housing work in
the first quarter of the year underlie the improved outlook for 1993. The
main beneficiaries are in the areas of health, education and roads.
It predicts output for this sector will rise 4 per cent to Pounds 4.8bn this
year. But next year growth is expected to slow to 3 per cent, and output
will fall by 2 per cent in 1995 because of the likely squeeze on exist-ing
public spending pro-grammes.
Mr Peter Roberts, chairman of the council's forecast panel, said that
maintaining current spending plans in the November Budget is vital for the
industry to sustain recovery and ensure positive growth in 1994 and 1995.
The public sector accounts for 39 per cent of the industry's output.
In the private housing sector, the council forecasts 'tentative optimism'
with an estimated 135,000 houses starting construction this year. This
compares with 119,800 last year, and a projected 150,000 in 1994 and 160,000
in 1995.
Public-sector housing starts are forecast to decline from next year after
strong growth in 1992 and 1993 as government funds for new housing
associations are reduced.
Output in the industrial sector is forecast to hold steady this year thanks
to spending by the privatised utility companies.
The commercial sector, depressed by the big surplus of offices and retail
premises, remains the industry's black spot. After falling 23 per cent last
year, output is forecast to fall a further 20 per cent this year to Pounds
3.93bn and another 10 per cent in 1994.

FT  03 AUG 93 / Lloyd's losses 'significantly damage economy'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LOSSES suffered by the Lloyd's of London insurance market have
significantly damaged the domestic economy and balance of payments, a report
published today finds.
Mr Ian Shepherdson, economist with Midland Global Markets Research, writes
in Greenwell Gilt Weekly that Lloyd's losses over the past five years of
more than Pounds 5.5bn are equivalent to the money lost on two or three
'Black Wednesdays'.
'Cumulative losses of this magnitude cannot be ring-fenced from the rest of
the economy,' he says.
Mr Shepherdson estimates that Names - the individuals whose assets support
underwriting - will need to find Pounds 2.3bn to fund the 1990 deficit of
Pounds 2.9bn announced in June in line with Lloyd's three-year accounting
system.
He says the amount is equal to more than 0.5 per cent of UK personal
disposable income and is more than the cost to the personal sector of 1p on
income tax.
He estimates: 'Personal consumption could be reduced by as much as 0.3 per
cent or 0.4 per cent per year as a result of Lloyd's losses.'
The crisis may also affect asset markets, he says. 'It is almost
inconceivable that the losses will have no effect on the property market.'
Lloyd's contribution to the current account has fallen from a surplus of
Pounds 1.4bn in 1987 to a provisional deficit of Pounds 600m last year. Over
the same period the annual current account deficit has risen from Pounds
4.5bn to Pounds 11.5bn.
'The Pounds 2bn swing in Lloyd's performance is equivalent to nearly 30 per
cent of the deterioration in the current account as a whole,' says Mr
Shepherdson.
He concedes that the degree of the impact reflects the shrinkage in the
current account deficit as a whole, but says the position could get worse.
'There is no guarantee that the losses have peaked.'
Lloyd's problems have coincided with a decline in fortunes of the insurance
sector as a whole, with the contribution of insurance companies, brokers and
Lloyd's to the current account falling from more than Pounds 3bn in 1987 to
some Pounds 700m in 1991.
Lloyd's yesterday confirmed that Mr David Bruce had resigned as finance
director to pursue other interests. The appointment of Mr Stephen Hall, who
recently retired from Ernst &amp; Young, is temporary pending a permanent
appointment.
Professor Anthony King, professor of government at the University of Essex,
has been appointed to advise a working party on voting arrangements and
other aspects of Names' representation at the market.
Lloyd's is reviewing its voting system which gives one vote to each Name
irrespective of how much capital they supply.

FT  03 AUG 93 / Tyne and Wear beats investment targets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRIVATE-SECTOR investment in Tyne and Wear Development Corporation sites
exceeded its target by 43 per cent in the last financial year, the
corporation's annual report and financial statements, published today, show.
In the year to March 31 the private sector channelled Pounds 86.2m into
sites alongside the rivers Tyne and Wear, against a target of Pounds 60.3m,
bringing total investment since the corporation was set up in 1987 to Pounds
530m, including public funds of Pounds 186.1m.
The report says this investment has built almost 2.3m sq ft of industrial
and commercial property, completed 846 homes, helped create 9,810 jobs and
reclaimed 760 acres of derelict land.
Mr Alastair Balls, chief executive, said that of the 600,000 sq ft of new
commercial space - equally split between office and industrial development -
completed during the year, nearly 95 per cent was already let.
The report says diversity has been the key to the corporation's success.

FT  03 AUG 93 / 'Filthiest fuel' is left to market forces: Orimulsion's
go-ahead will anger 'greens' and the coal industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE POLLUTION inspectorate's decision to give PowerGen the go-ahead to burn
orimulsion at two of its power stations - albeit with environmental
restrictions - will cause a storm of protest from several quarters.
The coal industry will see it as another blow in its struggle for survival.
Environmentalists, who have condemned orimulsion as the world's 'filthiest
fuel', will use it as further evidence of government duplicity on green
issues.
The public may wonder why Whitehall is prepared to authorise the use of a
controversial imported fuel when the country has so much gas, oil and coal
on its own doorstep.
Primarily the government wants the market to decide which fuels to use, and
the inspectorate has decided that orimulsion is not especially dirty.
Orimulsion is made in Venezuela from a mixture of bitumen and water, and can
be burnt in power stations designed to take heavy oil. The two power
stations authorised to use it - Ince on Merseyside and Richborough near
Sandwich, Kent - have been burning it on an experimental basis for several
years. Pollution inspectors have built up records of emissions and studied
the experience of other countries, notably Canada, where orimulsion is also
burnt.
The tests show that it emits more sulphur than oil or coal, but less of some
other harmful substances, such as nitrous oxide and carbon dioxide. It also
produces less dust, so there was no clear environmental case for banning it.
The authorisation requires PowerGen to install equipment by April 1998 to
remove most of the harmful emissions.
Officials stress that these conditions were attached not because orimulsion
is especially dirty but as part of a more tightly targeted approach for
Britain's power stations.
The authorisations were made under the 1990 Environmental Protection Act
which requires the pollution inspectorate to set emission limits based on
the best available pollution control techniques that do not entail excessive
cost. The inspectors also have to take into account Britain's ability to
meet international commitments to reduce emissions which cause acid rain -
which they believe can be done even with orimulsion.
The wider question of whether Britain needs yet another fuel is one the
government says must be left to the market. In its review of the coal
industry during last winter's pits crisis, the Department of Trade and
Industry said it could not interfere with contracts to import orimulsion,
which are handled mainly by a joint Venezuelan-British Petroleum company.
The DTI added that it expected imports to fall by 500,000 tonnes from last
year's level of 1.4m tonnes, but gave no reason. The forecast has been
widely questioned.
What is far from clear is how big the orimulsion market may become. National
Power, the UK's largest power generator, deferred two applications to burn
the fuel last year because the pollution inspectorate was insisting on
expensive clean-up equipment, and the generator's plans are now on ice.
The Treasury must also decide at what level to tax orimulsion, which is not
specifically provided for in the European Community's schedule of tariffs.
This will have a big bearing on its ability to compete with other fuels.
The new authorisations amount to less than 2 per cent of UK generation
capacity, so the impact will be relatively small. Even so, orimulsion has
crossed a big hurdle, and other potential users will now begin looking at it
more seriously.

FT  03 AUG 93 / BT 'special offer' calls ruled unfair
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A RECENT British Telecommunications 'special offer' to customers was
discriminatory to competitors and must not be repeated, Oftel, the
telecommunications watchdog, ruled yesterday.
BT will be obliged to agree new rules with Oftel to ensure that future
special offers do not favour its business to the detriment of competitors.
The ruling is a blow to BT, which sees special offers as a way to contain
competition from Mercury and cable TV companies, which are building local
phone networks in conurbations.
Oftel's decision concerns BT's 'Sunday Special' of November and December,
when most long-distance calls after 3pm on Sundays were charged at the local
cheap rate.
Mr Don Cruickshank, Oftel director-general, said the BT tariff for the
Sunday special 'failed to cover the costs of network usage, if those were
assessed on the basis used for other operators connecting to the BT
network'.
Similar behaviour by BT in future 'would have a significant effect on
competition in the telecommunications market' and could not be permitted.
Oftel has not imposed a penalty on BT, but its new rules governing future
special offers are likely to require BT to demonstrate that competitors can
take advantage of the same network tariffs for the use of the BT network as
the company charges itself.
In the longer term, Oftel's recent proposals for full accounting separation
between the 'network' and 'retail' parts of BT's business would make it
harder for BT to discriminate against competitors.
BT said it remained committed to special offers 'as far as they are
permitted by the regulatory regime'.
Mercury said Oftel's decision highlighted 'faultlines' in existing
regulation. 'We don't think tinkering with the existing regime is enough,
but . . . we want to see all competitors free to make exciting offers
provided they do not discriminate,' it said.

FT  03 AUG 93 / People: Bridon: high hopes for a healthy future
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
After nearly a year of management upheaval, largely due to illness, Bridon,
which manufactures and distributes wire rope and engineered products, has
found a new chief executive. He is 46-year-old American Ronald Petersen, who
has lived in the UK since 1981.
The last chief executive but one, David Allday, stepped down last September
because, as the then chairman John West put it at the time, 'he has had to
push water uphill and has had enough'.
In an internal appointment, Brian Clayton took over as chief executive with
the aim of 'revitalising group strategy and looking for a long-term
successor'. Then, in February, John West stepped down as non-executive
chairman because of his ill-health, to be succeeded by Derek Edwards, who,
however, died suddenly last month.
Hence Clayton, 60, steps down from his executive role, as planned, but
instead of becoming a non-executive director, becomes non-executive
chairman. Clayton adds that the company will 'in the short to medium term'
be looking for one or two more non-executive directors.
Petersen, who was picked primarily for his sales and marketing skills, was
previously chief executive of Insituform Group Ltd, responsible for all the
non-US activities of the American parent which sells systems for the
non-invasive lining of pipes.
Before that, he had worked, in North America and Europe, for Armstrong World
Industries, which manufactures and distributes flooring and ceiling systems.
With a total of 17 of the last 22 years spent in the UK, Petersen is
characterised by Clayton as 'very anglicised'.
While Bridon has been the subject of persistent bid speculation, Clayton
says it has all 'probably been without foundation'.
He says Petersen is on 'a perfectly normal contract with no strings
attached'.
