FT  28 JUL 93 / Anger as Ulster bags bulk of EC grant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
LABOUR MPs last night accused the prime minister of using the European
Community regional aid package to buy Ulster Unionist votes on the
Maastricht treaty. The attack followed the government's announcement that
Northern Ireland will receive more than half of the nearly Pounds 2bn-worth
of EC funding allotted to help the UK's poorest regions over the next five
years.
Mr Tim Sainsbury, the industry minister, said in a Commons written answer
yesterday that the province would receive Pounds 1.04bn, with Pounds 690m
going to Merseyside and Pounds 260m to the Highlands and Islands.
EC ministers last week decided how to apportion the Community's structural
funds between the 12 member states. The UK receives funds for Northern
Ireland, Merseyside and the Highlands and Islands because the regional gross
domestic product of these regions is 75 per cent or less of the EC average.
The government has divided the Pounds 2bn according to population.
Mr George Howarth, MP for Knowsley North, was among Merseyside Labour MPs to
attack the decision. He said: 'We did expect Pounds 1bn on Merseyside. It
would appear that Mr Major is willing to pay an extremely large price for
the nine Ulster Unionist votes last week.'

FT  28 JUL 93 / Industry prospects mixed despite muted inflation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHANIE FLANDERS and PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WEAKENING European export markets threaten the recovery in manufacturing,
even though sterling's devaluation has yet to have an impact on pushing up
costs.
That was the message from the Confederation of British Industry's quarterly
report of manufacturing trends, which paints a mixed picture of prospects
for the sector.
While inflationary pressures remain muted, the good export growth of the
first half of the year looks unlikely to be repeated in the second half due
to the deepening recession in continental Europe.
The CBI reports that the last four months have seen a modest rise in unit
costs for UK manufacturing companies, but this has not translated into
higher prices in either the domestic or export sector.
Mr Andrew Sentance, the CBI's economics director, said: 'Cost pressures are
remarkably subdued, given that there has always been concern that sterling's
depreciation would feed through into higher costs.'
The survey covered 1,346 manufacturing companies and was conducted between
June 25 and July 14.
Seventeen per cent of businesses said they had cut export prices over the
past four months, compared with 10 per cent saying they had raised them,
giving a negative balance of 7 percentage points.
This balance implies a squeeze in profits during a period when a positive
balance of 9 percentage points of companies reported a rise in unit costs
rather than a fall.
A balance of just 5 percentage points of companies said they were optimistic
about export prospects, compared with a balance of 21 points in April. A
balance of 7 points said they had increased export orders in the past four
months, a less bullish result than in April when the corresponding balance
was 10 points.
A more positive finding was that a balance of 8 points reported a rise in
overall orders in the past four months. This was the biggest rise since
April 1990, at around the start of the recession, and is a clear sign of
recovery.
Investment intentions remain weak, with fewer companies planning to spend
more on plant and machinery over the next year than the number expecting to
cut back. The negative balance of 3 percentage points represents only a
modest improvement in the outlook for investment since the April survey,
when the balance was minus 8 points.
In spite of the less promising outlook for exports, business confidence
increased for the third quarterly survey in a row, although by a smaller
amount than in April.

FT  28 JUL 93 / Families 'bear the brunt of recession'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD, Marketing Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE EFFECTS of the recession have had the greatest impact on families with
children, 79 per cent of which have been unable to carry out their spending
plans compared with 60 per cent of those without children, according to
research published yesterday by Mintel, the research group.
The study ranged widely across socio-demographic changes in households,
examining areas such as spending patterns, self-image, education and
employment.
The commonest reason for having to delay spending was the increased cost of
day-to-day living, given by 43 per cent of the 1,036 adults surveyed,
followed by 15 per cent who attributed spending delays to unemployment.
Only 5 per cent said increased mortgage payments were responsible. In spite
of the collapse of the housing market 77 per cent said they believed home
ownership was a good financial investment.
Households with children spend considerably more each week on almost all
consumer goods and services than those without children: 84 per cent more on
clothing and footwear (Pounds 22.90, against Pounds 12.46); 80 per cent more
on tea, coffee and soft drinks (Pounds 3.46 against Pounds 1.92); 72 per
cent more on cereals, bread and biscuits (Pounds 7.15 against Pounds 4.15);
and 71 per cent more on milk, fats, cheese and eggs (Pounds 8.23 against
Pounds 4.80).
The survey also asked 1,069 adults where they did their food shopping. The
retailer J Sainsbury came top for all types of household, with 20 per cent
shopping there, compared with 15 per cent for Tesco, the next most popular
choice. But 20 per cent of households with children favoured Tesco compared
with 17 per cent using Sainsbury.
The case for brand advertising in television and newspapers is weakened by
the report. From a sample base of 954 households, 54 per cent said their
preferred way of finding out about new food products was from on-pack
information, with only 13 per cent naming advertising.
Mail-order shopping is more popular with couples with children than those
without, with six in 10 parents buying at least one item by mail order
during the past year. Clothing and footwear were the most popular items.
The survey asked 5,008 adults about the self-image they aspired to. The most
popular was 'loyal/trustworthy' (71 per cent), followed by
'sensible/responsible' (61 per cent) and 'sensitive/caring' (52 per cent).
'Successful' was third from bottom (12 per cent), just above 'wild/
unpredictable' (6 per cent) and 'sophisticated/stylish' (4 per cent).
Mintel said that 80 per cent of women with children over the age of 10 have
paid work and the average number of children per household had shrunk from
2.4 to 1.8.
The report suggests that the first areas to benefit from an economic upturn
will be 'spending on the home, especially large-scale improvements such as
extensions and double glazing', for households with families.
Families put spending on leisure pursuits except holidays, and on clothing
and other fashion-related items last on the list.

FT  28 JUL 93 / Fear of bombings pushes shoppers out of town
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FEAR OF terrorist bombings is causing shoppers to favour out-of-town retail
parks instead of inner-city department stores, research published yesterday
by Leicester University's Centre for the Study of Public Order shows.
The study found that one in eight shoppers in Leicester had changed their
shopping behaviour to avoid city centres, and one third of this group said
they would not shop in London. More than 60 per cent said they had thought
about the possibility of a terrorist attack on their usual shopping
district.
Mr Andrew Willis, senior lecturer in criminology at Leicester University,
one of the two academics who carried out the study, said the perceived
terrorist threat also explained a 'surprising' degree of public willingness
to accept much tougher security regulations.
Of the sample of 839 people, 70 per cent said they would be prepared to
carry identity cards; 80 per cent would accept closed-circuit television
inside shops; 40 per cent were in favour of armed police in shopping areas;
25 per cent were willing to accept armed security guards; and 50 per cent
backed random road blocks and compulsory searches of bags and cars.
However, 65 per cent of the sample said that they opposed compulsory body
searches at stores.
Mr Willis said: 'It's in the interests of retailers to take these results
very seriously. The risk of a terrorist outrage is remote but nevertheless
the fear is real.
'This has measurable consequences, though it's very difficult to say how it
has affected the sales of city-centre stores. We tend to think shopping is a
minor domestic chore; the reality is that it's a major part of the domestic
economy - annual retail sales for 1992 were Pounds 368bn.'

FT  28 JUL 93 / MPs to probe Whitehall role
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A WIDE-RANGING inquiry into the role of the civil service has been launched
by a Commons committee concerned with the impact of recent reforms in
Whitehall.
The Treasury and Civil Service committee says it has heard evidence from a
variety of 'respected sources' of disquiet over the consequences of
government initiatives such as market-testing and the creation of agencies.
This has raised questions about the implications of these reforms for the
integrity of the civil service and its accountability to parliament.
The inquiry will consider 26 questions, including whether the civil service
has been politicised by 14 years of single-party government.
It will examine the need for a code of ethics in the light of episodes such
as the use of public money to pay some of the legal expenses of Mr Norman
Lamont, the former chancellor, in evicting a tenant, and the events
surrounding the sale of arms to Iraq.
It will also consider whether the role of ministerial policy-advisors could
be improved, including the open advertisement of top civil servants' jobs
and fixed-term contracts.
Mr Graham Mather, president of the European Policy Forum, which has
advocated such reforms, yesterday welcomed the launch of the inquiry. 'The
length of the list of questions to be answered suggests that Whitehall
reform is now forcing its way onto the political agenda,' he said.

FT  28 JUL 93 / When efficiency is not enough: Problems faced by Nuclear
Electric as it aims for privatisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
YESTERDAY was Nuclear Electric's chance to shine before the government's
review of nuclear power is launched later this year. Armed with impressive
statistics on market share and job reductions, it put up a creditable
performance.
Nonetheless the company has an uphill, perhaps impossible, task in achieving
the targets it has set for itself.
In the coming review Nuclear Electric and Scottish Nuclear, its counterpart
north of the border, will be attempting to demonstrate that the City was
wrong. Not only is the industry a commercial success, it is capable of
thriving in the private sector without subsidy, they will argue.
The country should also invest further in the sector by commissioning the
pressurised water nuclear reactor, Sizewell C, to enable it to start
producing electricity from the middle of the next decade.
If decisions about the nuclear industry were based on improving efficiency
alone, Nuclear Electric and Scottish Nuclear would stand every chance of
winning their arguments. In the past three years, Nuclear Electric has
improved productivity from 2.9GW to 4.5GW per hour and return on capital is
up from 4.5 per cent to 10.1 per cent.
Figures like these enabled Mr John Collier, Nuclear Electric chairman, to
reiterate yesterday his assurances that the company will make an operating
profit in 1995-96 even before taking account of the nuclear levy which is
charged to every electricity consumer to pay for the decommissioning of
plants inherited by Nuclear Electric.
In addition the company says the levy will not be needed at all beyond 1998.
Environmental groups including Friends of the Earth are not convinced. More
important for the future of privatisation, neither is the City. Fears over
the costs of future waste management and decommissioning lay behind the
aborted privatisation of the nuclear industry in 1989.
Yesterday's accounts showed that accumulated provisions for nuclear waste
and liabilities are Pounds 10.46bn, against Pounds 9.88bn in the previous
year. A critical factor in these figures is Nuclear Electric's assumptions
that decommissioning will take place over 100 years, which it wants
increased to 135. But environmentalists say, and the City fears, that both
timescales will have to be revised downwards, dramatically increasing the
cost.
Further uncertainties are raised by Nuclear Electric's negotiations with
British Nuclear Fuels for fuel services which amount to more than a third of
Nuclear Electric's costs. The deal is having to be revised following the
government's refusal to underwrite the risks of costs rising.
Mr Collier said yesterday he would like the government to take over the
liabilities the company has inherited from the Central Electricity
Generating Board and the levy that goes with it.
This would enable Nuclear Electric to widen its appeal to potential
investors since liabilities from pressurised water reactors are lower and,
arguably, easier to predict than from the ageing magnox reactors inherited
from the CEGB.
The government last winter declined to do this. It seems unlikely to change
its mind.
The nuclear industry's best hope in the forthcoming review is that the
government will set wide terms of reference which compare the environmental
impact of all forms of energy for making electricity, including their
emissions of carbon and sulphur.
The signs from Whitehall are that the review will only ask whether the
private sector is prepared to fund the building of Sizewell C. The key to
that, and to the privatisation of Nuclear Electric, will be the attitude of
the government on underwriting decommissioning and waste disposal costs.

FT  28 JUL 93 / Ulster scoops bulk of EC grant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NORTHERN IRELAND will receive more than half of the nearly Pounds 2bn-worth
of European Community funding allotted to help the UK's poorest regions over
the next five years.
Mr Tim Sainsbury, the industry minister, said in a Commons written answer
yesterday that Northern Ireland would receive Pounds 1.04bn, with Pounds
690m going to Merseyside and Pounds 260m to the Highlands and Islands.
EC ministers last week decided how to apportion the Community's structural
funds between the 12 member states. The UK receives funds for Northern
Ireland, Merseyside and the Highlands and Islands because the regional gross
domestic product of these regions is 75 per cent or less than the EC
average. The government has divided the Pounds 2bn according to population.
Although there is no EC check on how the funds are spent, structural fund
regulations commit the UK government to spend a sum which is at least 25 per
cent of that provided by the EC and which is no less than the amount it has
spent over the last five years.
The poorest regions are classified 'Objective One' by the EC. A map of
regions classified 'Objective Two', because they are suffering from
industrial decline and are eligible for other EC structural funding, is
being drawn up for publication in the autumn.

FT  28 JUL 93 / Nuclear Electric to shed 2,000 jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NUCLEAR ELECTRIC, the state-owned electricity generator, said yesterday it
expects to shed up to 2,000 jobs, more than 15 per cent of the total, this
financial year. It made the announcement as it disclosed an operating profit
for 1992-93 of Pounds 661m.
The staff reduction, the biggest annual employment fall proportionally since
the company was formed three years ago, is being implemented as the company
prepares for a government review of nuclear power which Nuclear Electric
hopes will lead to privatisation.
Mr John Collier, chairman, said any privatisation decision rested with the
government. However, he said, the company's commercial success would soon
mean that a move out of the state sector would be seen as feasible and
desirable.
Environmental groups said the results for last year were misleading. Mr
Clive Bates of Greenpeace said that without Pounds 1.3bn from the nuclear
levy paid by electricity consumers Nuclear Electric would have made a loss
of Pounds 619m.
Nuclear Electric, which operates the nuclear power stations in England and
Wales, said the levy is to cover problems inherited from the Central
Electricity Generating Board, from which it was formed three years ago.
However, Mr Bates insisted that part of the subsidy was being used to prop
up the on-going business.
Nuclear Electric plans to reduce staff to between 9,300 and 9,500 by next
March, compared to 11,377 at the start of the financial year four months
ago, and 14,164 when the company was formed in 1990.
A staff reduction of 1,300 in the year to March 31 helped the company
improve operating profits by 37 per cent from last year's Pounds 482m.
Also influential was the radical improvement in the performance of advanced
gas-cooled reactor stations which Nuclear Electric - and the CEGB before it
 -have struggled for years to make perform at full efficiency.
The company said yesterday all such stations were 100 per cent available for
large parts of the winter. This enabled it to increase its share of the
electricity market by 14 per cent to 55 terawatt (55m MW) hours and win 21.6
per cent of the electricity market in England and Wales, an improvement of 3
percentage points.
Mr Bob Hawley, chief executive, said he expected his company to overtake
PowerGen in 1996 as the second-largest generator. This would become possible
after the Sizewell B power station starts producing electricity next year.

FT  28 JUL 93 / Powerbroker who fell from grace: Obituary - T. Dan Smith
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
T. DAN SMITH, the charismatic Geordie local politician who fell from grace
in the Poulson corruption scandal, died yesterday in the Freeman Hospital,
Newcastle, aged 78. He was undergoing surgery after collapsing at home.
One of Britain's most ebullient post-war local government figures, the
miner's son rose from a boyhood and socialist youth in the modest terraced
streets of Wallsend to become a tireless powerbroker, driven by a mission to
change his native north-east and, say his enemies, to wield power.
For good or ill, he stamped his vision on Newcastle upon Tyne, where he was
council leader for five years in the 1960s, sweeping away slums and ushering
in the city's 'Brasilia' era of multi-storey blocks of flats and motor-ways.
One city alone seemed insufficient for the energies of the man who became
known as Mr Newcastle; he became the first chairman of the northern Economic
Planning Council, formulating a vision of change for the entire region; a
member of the Royal Commission on Local Government in England; and chairman
of Peterlee new town development corporation on County Durham.
His political career was wrecked by his involvement in the web of corruption
surrounding the architect John Poulson. In 1974, T. Dan Smith was sentenced
to six years in prison for accepting Pounds 156,000 from Mr Poulson.
Released after three years, Mr Smith was politically persona non grata; only
in 1987 did his local Labour party agree to his being readmitted.
He remained a forceful personality, campaigning after his release for
prisoners' rights. He also relished a new role as an independent,
challenging pundit on north-east matters; only a few days ago he was taking
part, with his usual verve, in a Radio Newcastle phone-in.

FT  28 JUL 93 / BCCI auditors lose legal action
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
PRICE Waterhouse yesterday failed in a court attempt to halt a disciplinary
inquiry by the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales into
the firm's role as auditors of the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce
International, which was closed down two years ago.
The High Court dismissed an application by partners in the firm who had
sought to challenge the institute's decision to proceed with an inquiry
while legal actions were still pending against the firm over handling of the
BCCI accounts.
They said the inquiry was unfair and could prejudice its ability to defend
itself both before the inquiry and in court.
Lord Justice Mann said Price Waterhouse co-ordinated BCCI's worldwide audits
from June 1987. The withdrawal of BCCI's banking licences which led to the
bank's demise in July 1991 followed a Price Waterhouse report which
disclosed widespread fraud.
Among the court actions pending against the firm are three UK actions by
BCCI's liquidators claiming damages for negligence in connection with the
1985, 1986 and 1987 audits. There are also actual or possible proceedings in
the US, Luxembourg and the Cayman Islands.
The judge, sitting with Mr Justice Sedley, said there was 'no real risk of
injustice' which would entitle the court to intervene to prevent the
performance in the public interest of an investigative procedure which was
part of the institute's supervisory function.

FT  28 JUL 93 / Welsh agency is 53% self-financing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM, Wales and West Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR THE FIRST time since it was set up by the government in 1975, the Welsh
Development Agency has funded more than half its income itself, its annual
report shows.
Of Pounds 166m in income in the year to the end of March, 53 per cent was
self-funded compared with 46 per cent in the previous year. Property sales
doubled to nearly Pounds 50m while the government grant was cut by almost
Pounds 10m to Pounds 78m.
The report makes no mention of the concerns raised by the National Audit
Office on the previous year's results, which led to this month's highly
critical report by the Commons public accounts committee about aspects of
the agency's internal management. The audit office has approved this year's
accounts.
The agency said that during a tough year for business, it had achieved
results which in several areas had been better than forecast. There had been
201 inward investment projects with forecast capital expenditure of almost
Pounds 950m.

FT  28 JUL 93 / Scott attacks Iraq exports secrecy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LORD Justice Scott and a senior civil servant yesterday clashed over the
apparent lack of public accountability of Britain's policy on arms to Iraq.
Questioning Mr Ian Blackley of the Foreign Office during the arms-for-Iraq
inquiry, the judge said that government documents indicated a mistrust
within Whitehall of the public which had led government to restrict the
information made available to parliament on defence exports.
'You didn't want to deal with the public because the opposition of what you
were proposing might have been intense . . . so you thought it better to
take decisions under the table,' the judge said.
Mr Blackley in reply said that the judge was alleging the 'whole machinery
of government' was being conducted under the table. He said there had been
occasions during the 1980s when it had been politically justified to prevent
information from reaching a 'vociferous minority' in and out of parliament.
The issue over public accountability emerged yesterday as the judge and Ms
Presiley Baxendale QC, his counsel, questioned Mr Blackley on why, as
assistant head of the Foreign Office's Middle East department, he had
approved the export of machine tools made by Matrix Churchill and other UK
manufacturers although he knew that the exports were in breach of the
government's guidelines.
In a confidential memo dated January 1988, Mr Blackley advised his
colleagues that the companies should be told to 'produce and ship as fast as
they can', and to 'renounce publicity and lobbying for their own good'. The
memo was written in spite of a warning from British intelligence that the
machine tools were being used to build up Iraq's arms manufacturing
capability.
The exchange was the second public clash between the Scott inquiry and a
civil servant in less than a month. The attitude taken by Foreign Office
officials is understood to reflect growing unease at the way government
decision-making in the 1980s is being subjected to increasing scrutiny by
Lord Justice Scott.
The public hearings were adjourned yesterday until the second week of
September. The judge's report is not expected now until next year. It was
planned for Christmas.

FT  28 JUL 93 / SIB probes Goldman Sachs deal: Maxwell shares transaction
may be subject to British regulation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SECURITIES and Investments Board has launched an inquiry into a
transaction between Goldman Sachs, the US-based investment bank, and one of
the pension schemes formerly controlled by the late Robert Maxwell.
The Securities and Futures Authority, the self-regulatory body which
oversees Goldman Sachs' UK operations, has already examined the transaction
and did not consider disciplinary action because the transaction had been
booked through Goldman Sachs in New York, and was therefore outside the
jurisdiction of UK regulators.
Instead, the authority passed information to the US Securities Exchange
Commission.
But in a letter to the Commons social security committee, released
yesterday, SIB said it had 'come across a point which it does believe merits
further UK inquiry'.
It is believed that SIB has learned that the transaction was cleared and
settled in London, which could make it subject to UK regulatory rules.
If SIB decides UK regulators do have jurisdiction over the transaction and
Goldman Sachs is found to have breached UK securities rules, SIB could order
it to pay Pounds 56m to two pension schemes. It could also levy a fine.
In June Goldman Sachs was fined Pounds 160,000 for three breaches of rules
in connection with transactions between it and the Maxwell interests.
The inquiry relates to a transfer in April 1991 of 12.5m shares in Maxwell
Communication Corporation from the MCC Works Pension Scheme to two Swiss
trusts established by Robert Maxwell.
Goldman Sachs acted as agent in the transfer on the orders of Mr Kevin
Maxwell. He ordered payment for the shares to go not to the pension schemes
but to Bishopsgate Investment Trust, a company which acted for the Maxwell
family private interests.
Responding to SIB's letter, Goldman Sachs said: 'As we understand it, the
SIB is examining a specific jurisdictional point. We have fully responded to
their inquiry of today. As has been true in the case of other regulatory
authorities which have examined these trades, we would expect to respond
appropriately to any further inquiries the SIB may make.'
While SIB's letter refers to the MCC works scheme, the transaction was part
of a larger deal in which shares were purchased from the Mirror Group
Newspaper pension scheme and the proceeds were also directed to Bishopsgate.

FT  28 JUL 93 / Ambulance complaints service attacked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
POOR service from the London Ambulance Service had been matched by a
complaints system which its chief executive accepted was 'not working at
all', a Commons committee said yesterday.
A report by the Commons committee on the parliamentary commissioner for
administration (the ombudsman) says all complaints about ambulance services
mentioned in the health service commissioner's 1991-92 report involved
London.
Two thirds related to its accident and emergency service, with 75 per cent
of all complaints concerning delays.
The failure of the London computerised dispatch system last year resulted in
a report severely criticising the management of the London Ambulance
Service.
Mr Martin Gorman, who later became its chief executive, told the committee
he had inherited a complaints system that was not working at all. Describing
the situation as 'appalling', the committee commends Mr Gorman for
increasing staff to clear a backlog of complaints.
It was clear, it says, that there had been 'wholly ineffective supervision
of complaints' by the management of South West Thames regional health
authority, which is responsible for the London service.
On the general issue of National Health Service complaints the committee
foundthat the system is given a low priority, with under-qualified staff and
wholly inadequate supervision.

FT  28 JUL 93 / Astra milked training payouts, Labour claims
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD and ROLAND ADBURGHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE controversy over Astra Training, which has gone into receivership,
intensified yesterday when the Labour party claimed that the organisation,
one of the largest providers of training, had been milking the training
payments system.
Mr Frank Dobson, shadow employment spokesman, claimed that Astra had been
offering former trainees temporary jobs - lasting as little as one week - so
that the company could collect bonuses of Pounds 600 to Pounds 1,000 per
person.
Astra, set up three years ago when the government privatised the Skills
Training Agency, has been operating in an increasingly competitive
marketplace.
The Training and Enterprise Councils - which administer publicly funded
training schemes in England and Wales such as those Astra provides - are
increasingly having their funding related to the success training providers
have in delivering jobs and qualifications - rather on the basis of the
number of training places provided.
Tecs can pay bonuses to training organisations under some circumstances, for
example where a trainee has a job 13 weeks after completing training.
Mr Dobson alleged that Astra had, in some cases, given former trainees one
week's work with the company or friendly employers for the 13th week after
training.
The Department of Employment, which said yesterday it had no evidence that
Astra had broken any rules, defines a job as including full-time or
part-time work which may be permanent, temporary or casual.
Labour has consistently criticised the government's privatisation of its
skill centres. Astra was paid Pounds 11m to take most of them over. Four
other centres, taken over by TICC, went into liquidation last year.
Training providers have had a difficult time recently - not only because of
new funding regimes but also because of the recession and its impact on
training.
Mr John Troth, chairman of North-east Wales Tec said yesterday: 'There is an
an increasing tightness of funding that has forced providers into a more and
more competitive situation and some unfortunately cannot cope, particularly
those which have been based on charitable status.'
Labour has called on the government and the Charity Commissioners to
investigate the collapse of Commercial and Industrial Training Services.
The company, a registered charity limited by guarantee, was based in
Caerphilly. It had 42 staff and contracts with the Tecs of Mid Glamorgan,
South Glamorgan and Gwent. It is believed to have considerable debts but it
has not yet been placed in receivership.
Mr Ron Davies, shadow Welsh secretary, said: 'CITS has lost large sums of
money despite being pumped full of public funds.'

FT  28 JUL 93 / Government seeks bids to run local careers services
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BIDS to run career services were yesterday invited in 14 'pathfinder areas'
by the Department of Employment.
Under new legislation, the government has taken responsibility for careers
services from local education authorities, and over the next few years bids
will be invited throughout England and Wales.
The programme will be phased to prevent disruption in advice. Bids were
invited yesterday from areas including Avon, Bedfordshire, Surrey, Cumbria,
Birmingham, Oldham and Wigan.
No bids were invited from the London area because ministers are still
considering whether there should be a single service to cover London and, if
not, how many constituent parts there should be.
Miss Ann Widdecombe, the minister in charge of the service, said she
envisaged bids from a wide range of organisations.
A local education authority could bid on its own or with a local training
and enterprise council - the bodies repsonsible for delivering
government-funded training schemes. Some larger recruitment organisations
might also want to bid.
Miss Widdecombe moved to calm fears on career officers' job security. 'I
would be amazed if somebody put in a successful bid without involving the
existing providers,' she said.
The current service is free to people under 21 in or just out of education
or training. Miss Widdecombe said new providers could supply other services
and charge for them.

FT  28 JUL 93 / N Cyprus may end protection of Nadir
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS, RACHEL JOHNSON and JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NORTHERN CYPRUS has given its strongest indication to date that it may be
prepared to abandon its uncompromising protection of Mr Asil Nadir, the
fugitive former Polly Peck chairman.
The authorities, with the apparent blessing of the Turkish government, have
invited senior officers of the Serious Fraud Office to the island without
any apparent diplomatic strings.
The fraud office had argued that it was unable to pursue its investigation
on the island because the local authorities and Ankara were insisting on a
formal diplomatic exchange.
This would have implied British recognition of Turkish sovereignty over
northern Cyprus, which the UK refuses to give.
The Serious Fraud Office confirmed last night that one of its investigating
teams travelled to northern Cyprus yesterday at the 'invitation' of the
Turkish Cypriot authorities.
'We have been invited to explore the possibility of future investigation and
co-operation,' the fraud office said last night.
It is believed that a two-person team, led by Ms Lorna Harris, the SFO
lawyer handling the Nadir case, is representing the Serious Fraud Office on
the island.
The Foreign Office said last night that there was no diplomatic coercion
behind the decision and that the invitation had come from the Turkish
Cypriots.
The initiative follows a visit to Turkey last month by Ms Harris at which
she is understood to have discussed how Mr Nadir might be persuaded to
return to the UK to attend his trial in September.
The visit was the first apparent break in the deadlock over attempts to
bring Mr Nadir to justice since he jumped his Pounds 3.5m bail on May 5th.
and flew to northern Cyprus.
Mr Nadir has indicated his intention to fly to Turkey to regain the remnants
of his former business empire which he would be legally able to own and run
in Turkey although he is a bankrupt in the UK.
There was no immediate reaction yesterday from the northern Cypriot
authorities or from Mr Nadir to the development. However SFO officials
indicated they hoped the invitation signified the prospect of significant
progress on the Nadir case in the coming days.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CREATION of the Urban Regeneration Agency to take responsibility for
bringing derelict land into use reflects 'a continued stagnation in
government thinking on urban policy', according to a local authority report.
The study, by the Docklands Consultative Committee, an association of east
London local authorities, criticises the agency's emphasis on property
development schemes and its reliance on the 'trickle down' of benefits to
the community.
The report says the agency's potential is limited by the government's
unwillingness to link it to a wider economic or industrial strategy, while
its limited resources will prevent it from making much impact.
The report was largely based on responses to the Department of the
Environment's consultation paper on the agency.

FT  28 JUL 93 / Waste mountains prove difficult to conquer: The lesson of a
German recycling scheme that came to grief through overspill
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE spectre over the government's new packaging recycling moves, announced
yesterday, is a similar German scheme launched two years ago.
Mr John Elkington, director of Sustainability, an independent environmental
consultancy, said yesterday: 'A few years ago I would have welcomed this
move wholeheartedly. In the wake of the (German) experience I am concerned
that the simple setting of ambitious targets is only a small part of what
needs to be done.'
The crisis in the German waste recycling scheme, the Duales System
Deutschland (DSD), came to a head last month when it tottered on the edge of
bankruptcy before being propped up at the last minute by funds from
industry.
Even so, a mountain of waste - particularly plastics - is still threatening
to overwhelm German towns. The country's recycling capacity has not kept
pace with people's taste for filling the scheme's yellow sacks with
carefully sorted rubbish, while demand for recycled material has been much
less than expected.
The effects are spilling over into other countries. Mr Cameron Mclatchie,
chairman of British Polythene Industries, one of Europe's leading makers of
polythene film, said that this year the price of imported black film to
cover silages had dropped 'through the floor' to around Pounds 60 per tonne
 -about half the cost to him of collecting it from British farms for
recycling.
Ms Jane Bickerstaffe, technical director of the Industry Council for
Packaging and the Environment (INCPEN), said: 'Several recycling firms have
gone out of business in this country in the past six months because German
waste is offered here.' Without those 'repercussions' from Germany, the
packaging industry 'could certainly achieve 50 per cent recycling by the
year 2000', she said.
Mr Peter Hindle, an associate director of environmental at Procter &amp; Gamble,
also warns that the costs can be high. P&amp;G's use of recycled plastic for
detergent bottles 'currently does add to costs', and was no longer a clear
competitive advantage as 'everyone's doing it'. Consumers were now
interested in refillable bottles and other measures that reduced the amount
of packaging, he added.
Some industrialists and environmental consultants have also questioned
whether the proposals could, ironically, be damaging to the environment
because of the extra transport needed to collect the rubbish, and the energy
used in washing and recycling it into usable material.
Mr Mclatchie said that, when it comes to household waste, 'after you wash it
and transport it, the cost of getting it back in environmental terms is
greater than any benefit. And do you actually see the British consumer
washing up used frozen pea bags?'

FT  28 JUL 93 / World Trade News: US dismisses 40 'dumped' steel claims

THE US International Trade Commission yesterday discarded 40 of 72 steel
complaints brought by the US industry against imports from 20 countries,
saying that the 'dumped' and subsidised steel had not injured American
producers.
However, most of the high-value corrosion-resistant products and
cut-to-length plate were found to have caused harm. Duties of up to 109 per
cent levied temporarily by the US Commerce Department will now become
permanent.
Two cases from the UK, involving subsidised and 'dumped' cut-to-length
plate, were both found to have injured US producers. Steel is defined as
'dumped' when the Commerce Department finds it was sold in the US 'at less
than fair market value'.
Sir Leon Brittan, EC external economic relations commissioner, described the
ruling as 'most encouraging' and said it would do much to improve the
atmosphere for the Uruguay Round multilateral trade talks.
Appearing somewhat surprised that the ITC had rejected many of the
complaints, Sir Leon said the ruling would 'help to defuse substantially
what had become a very grave trade dispute'.
The six ITC commissioners - three Democrats and three Republicans - all
spoke of the complexity of the steel market and the difficulty of their
decisions. Mr David Rohr, a Democratic commissioner, said the process which
produced yesterday's mixed results emerged from 'the most open and
transparent of any anti-dumping or countervailing duty regime in the world'.
He insisted: 'There is no place or opportunity in that process for political
considerations.'
Many of the companies which avoided duties held only a small market share.
Producers from Argentina, Australia, Italy and New Zealand emerged
completely unscathed. All hot-rolled and most cold-rolled imports were found
not to have caused injury.
Japan's hot and cold-rolled imports were found not to have caused injury but
the ITC found against its important corrosion-resistance line.
Andrew Baxter adds: British Steel said last night that the 109 per cent duty
on plate 'would not unduly hurt us financially'. Its exports of steel plate
to the US were worth Pounds 7m in 1991, less than 0.7 per cent of the total
US market.

FT  28 JUL 93 / World Trade News: Taiwan PM backs BAe venture - UK group
confident of Pounds 250m deal despite need for further funds

<TEXT>
MR LIEN CHAN, Taiwan's prime minister, has approved a plan to support the
Pounds 250m joint venture between British Aerospace and Taiwan Aerospace
Corporation (TAC). Some financial details have yet to be finalised, but BAe
said yesterday that for the first time it regarded the deal as a certainty.
Mr Denny Ko, TAC's president, nevertheless, sounded a note of caution,
saying the securing of further private sector funds required for the joint
venture - Avro International Aerospace - could take another month.
The deal is central to BAe's drive to return to profitability. It would mean
that manufacturing of the RJ range of regional jets would be partly in
Taiwan, which is close to the fast-growing markets of east Asia and which
offers lower labour costs.
The venture also offers Taiwan a route into the aviation industry and would
let it upgrade its component industry and design and manufacturing
capabilities.
BAe had set a July 31 deadline for conclusion of the deal but said it was
satisfied with the Taiwanese government's 'irrevocable commitment' to the
deal yesterday.
Mr Ko said he might yet have to visit the UK for further talks with BAe. 'I
hope the (government's) commitment will also be enough for BAe to feel
comfortable.'
Mr Yang Shih-chien, Taiwan's deputy economics minister, confirmed the
government would increase its direct equity holding in TAC from a previously
planned 29 per cent to 39 per cent of the company's TDollars 5.24bn (Dollars
129m) capitalisation.
This holding will be through two bodies; a government development fund,
which will lift its stake in TAC from 24 per cent to 29 per cent, and the
state-run Chiao Tung Bank, which will raise its stake from 5 per cent to 10
per cent. The China Development Corp, owned by the ruling Kuomintang party
will also take a 10 per cent share.
Mr Yang said the economics ministry would officially request a local bank
consortium led by the Chiao Tung Bank to extend a Dollars 400m secured
credit line to Avro's leasing company and Dollars 60m in working capital.
TAC still needs to secure about TDollars 1.3bn in equity inputs from private
investors to reach its planned capitalisation of TDollars 5.24bn.
Mr Yang added that the ministry of national defence would make the resources
of its Aeronautics Industry Development Centre available for the project.

Bulgaria's telecommunications network is to be upgraded for business users
by Telecom Netherlands, under a joint venture with the Bulgarian state
telecommunications company signed yesterday, Andrew Adonis reports from
London.
Telecom Netherlands will install and operate an 'overlay business network'
to provide an enhanced service for companies in or near Bulgaria's eight
largest cities. International traffic will be routed via a satellite
connection between Sofia and the Netherlands, established by Telecom
Netherlands last October.
When completed, the network will have a capacity of about 10,000 lines.
Bulgaria has one of eastern Europe's better telecommunications systems, with
about 25 lines per 100 people.

Kawachiya, a Tokyo-based discount retailer, has taken Shiseido, Japan's
leading cosmetics maker, to the Fair Trade Commission for denying the
retailer shipments of the company's cosmetics, Emiko Terazono writes from
Tokyo.
In a complaint filed yesterday with the FTC, the country's anti-monopoly
watchdog, the retailer claimed Shiseido's actions were intended to stop the
discounting of its high-grade cosmetics. Shiseido said Kawachiya was
wholesaling cosmetics, rather than selling to retail customers.

NATIONAL Semiconductor, the US chipmaker, has filed a complaint with the US
International Trade Commission against Mitsubishi Electric of Japan. The
complaint relates to a patent infringement suit also filed by the US
company, Louise Kehoe reports from San Francisco.
National charges that Mitsubishi's semiconductor products infringe several
broad patents covering basic semiconductor technology. The complaints were
filed against Mitsubishi after 'exhausting all possible negotiations for a
cross-licensing agreement,' National said.
National is asking the ITC to halt imports of semiconductor products that
allegedly infringe its patents.

ABB Transportation Systems, part of the Swiss-Swedish engineering group, has
won a deal worth about Dollars 200m (Pounds 133.3m) to transfer mainline
electric locomotive technology to Indian Railways, Andrew Baxter writes from
London.
The deal, signed with India's Ministry of Railways, will be largely financed
by the Asian Development Bank and covers technology transfer and delivery of
30 locomotives.
The 10-year agreement means India will become the first Asian country to
have three-phase drive locomotive technology, incorporating sophisticated
electronics and microprocessor control.
It is the first time that ABB has granted a licence outside the company for
the three-phase drive techn-ology. A three-phase motor does not need a
commutator, is lighter than conventional electric motors and more
economical.

FT  28 JUL 93 / World Trade News: Air France link with Continental
</HEADLINE>

   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AIR France and Continental Airlines of the US yesterday agreed to
co-ordinate their businesses.
Both carriers already have links with Air Canada and the new deal creates
one of the biggest transatlantic alliances in the airline industry.
Air France and Continental will sell seats on each other's flights and
adjust timetables to improve connections between their services. The deal
will also see the two airlines moving into each other's terminals in their
main airports at Charles de Gaulle in Paris, and Newark, New Jersey. They
are already together at Houston, Texas, another of Continental's hubs.
The two carriers will link their frequent-flyer incentive programmes, run
joint promotions and link package tours.
The move is Continental's first collaboration since it emerged from Chapter
11 protection in April this year. It completes a triangular alliance that
compares in size with other transatlantic teams such as British Airways and
USAir and KLM and Northwest Airlines.
Mr Bernard Attali, chairman of Air France, said the French carrier and
Continental would look at ways to extend their agreement to 'intertwine'
businesses further. This would include possible collaboration in
maintenance, catering, information systems and code-sharing, under which a
passenger booking a two-stage flight involving both airlines would receive a
single ticket and flight number.
'An equity stake is not on the agenda today,' Mr Attali added, although both
airlines refused to discuss the possibility of such a link in the future.
Air Canada took a 27.5 per cent stake in Continental as part of the
arrangement which took the US carrier out of Chapter 11. It already does
maintenance work on some Continental aircraft and has begun flights to
Houston.
The alliance between Air France, Continental and Air Canada may increase
pressure on other European and US carriers to conclude discussions
successfully on closer co-operation.
American Airlines, one of the big three carriers in the US, had been in
talks with several European airlines, including Air France and Lufthansa of
Germany.
Continental's revenues last year exceeded Dollars 5bn (Pounds 3.3bn) and it
serves 197 airports in 28 countries. Air France's 1992 sales were FFr57bn
(Pounds 6.44bn) and it flies to 228 destinations in 109 countries.

US consumer confidence edged lower in July, following decreases in the two
preceding months, the Conference Board said yesterday, AP-DJ reports from
New York.
The board's consumer confidence index fell to 57.7 from June's revised 58.6,
which was previously reported at 58.9. It said that while the latest decline
was insignificant, the cumulative loss in the index since the start of the
year had been 19 points.
'Clearly, the latest message from the consumer strongly suggests that the
economy still fails to show any convincing signs of a vigorous recovery,'
said Mr Fabian Linden, for the Conference Board.

FT  28 JUL 93 / US tightens immigration curbs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton yesterday launched a programme to tighten US
immigration controls and clamp down on smuggling rings that bring foreigners
into the country illegally.
He asked Congress for Dollars 172m to hire up to 600 more border patrol
agents and boost efforts to stop immigrant-smugglers and intercept smuggling
ships at sea.
'It's certainly plain to anybody with eyes to see that the border patrol is
drastically understaffed, breathtakingly understaffed,' Mr Clinton said.
He also called for a process of 'expedited exclusion' which would allow
officials to rule summarily on asylum requests, instead of allowing
asylum-seekers to stay for months while their cases are judged.
Anyone trying to smuggle in aliens would face anti-racketeering charges and
doubled prison sentences. In recent months, there have been a series of
attempts to land illegal immigrants by ship.
The measures have also been prompted by doubts about the effectiveness of US
consular officials in screening visa applicants for terrorist links.
There is the recent case of Sheikh Omar Abdel Rahman, a militant Moslem
preacher, several of whose followers have been arrested in connection with
the bombing of the World Trade Centre in New York. Sheikh Omar is in custody
awaiting deportation proceedings, although he entered the US legally on a
visa issued after a CIA review.
Mr Clinton insisted the US was not seeking to close its doors to legal
immigrants and would remain 'the world's greatest melting pot'. However, 'we
must say no to illegal immigration so we can continue to say yes to legal
immigration,' he said.

THE four-way tariff-cutting deal at the Tokyo summit earlier this month has
succeeded in reanimating the Uruguay Round of global trade talks in Geneva.
However, real negotiations will not begin until the autumn, trade officials
said yesterday.
Mr Peter Sutherland, director general of the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade, will use today's meeting of the overseer Trade Negotiations
Committee to set out 'mile posts' for the negotiations in the next three
months, to ensure no momentum is lost.
The 116-nation Round, already three years' overdue, must conclude by
December 15 when the US administration's negotiating authority expires.
The past two weeks have been taken up mainly with clarification of the
accord reached on July 7 by the 'Quad' nations (the US, European Community,
Japan and Canada), to eliminate or slash tariffs on 18 categories of
manufactured goods and make progress on liberalisation of trade in services.
Line-by-line details of the accord became available only at the end of last
week.
Quad negotiators have been explaining the deal's implications for third
countries, and they and other participants have put down markers for
bargaining on market access for manufactures, farm products and services.
However, exporters of farm goods have been disappointed by the slow start to
bargaining on measures to open the market for agriculture, where the EC in
particular has not been ready to negotiate. Agricultural products were not
covered by the Tokyo agreement.
The hope is that, after consultations with governments, negotiators will
return to Geneva at the end of August ready to deal across the whole range
of market access issues. They must also tackle outstanding differences in
the Uruguay Round draft rules package, where the US has raised a host of
objections covering, among others, anti-dumping, textiles, intellectual
property, and the creation of a powerful multilateral trade organisation.

PRESIDENT Bill Clinton's plan to hold an informal summit of the 15-member
Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation (Apec) forum in Seattle in November has
won widespread support from Asian governments this week, to the surprise of
the US and its Asian rivals.
Only Dr Mahathir Mohamad, the Malaysian prime minister, who advocates a more
restricted group (known as the East Asia Economic Caucus) which excludes the
US, has turned down Mr Clinton's invitation.
Most other Apec members, after some initial wavering at a meeting in
Singapore between South-East Asian countries and their principal trading
partners, have fallen in behind the US.
'I predict it will be a very successful event,' Mr Warren Christopher, US
secretary of state, told a meeting of American businessmen yesterday.
Another US official said there was 'strong support and enthusiasm' for the
summit proposal.
Apec comprises the six members of the Association of South-East Asian
Nations or Asean (Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, the Philippines
and Brunei), their main Asia-Pacific trading partners (the US, Japan,
Australia, New Zealand, Canada and South Korea) and the 'three Chinas'
(China, Taiwan and Hong Kong).
The main problem facing the Apec summit is Beijing's assertion that the
leaders of Taiwan and Hong Kong should not attend, as they represent
regional economies rather than sovereign states.
The US says Apec, which was launched four years ago and accounts for about
half the world's gross national product, will not be protectionist and will
facilitate contacts between the Pacific nations.
Dr Mahathir, however, believes the US will try to dominate the organisation.
Under a compromise reached among Asean members at the weekend, the EAEC will
become a caucus within Apec but will be able to act independently.
The compromise has left Japan and South Korea uncertain as to whether they
should join the EAEC at the risk of angering the US. 'We are still somewhat
puzzled by how it's going to work,' Mr Christopher said of the EAEC
compromise.

FT  28 JUL 93 / Congress grapples with S&amp;L funding: Bank regulators appeal
for urgent action
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DEMOCRATIC leaders in the US Congress yesterday tried to work out a way to
approve the Dollars 34bn (Pounds 22.6bn) needed to complete a clean-up of
the savings and loan debacle after a plea from top banking regulators for
Congress not to welch on the government's 'most solemn promises'.
The bill would provide a final instalment of Dollars 18bn to the Resolution
Trust Corporation, the government company set up to take over and close down
or sell off bankrupt S&amp;Ls, as well as Dollars 16bn to float a new deposit
insurance fund for the industry.
Congress failed to pass the legislation last year, and the RTC has since
been living hand-to-mouth. While the Senate has passed the bill, Democratic
leaders in the House of Representatives are unwilling to bring it to a vote
unless they win some support from Republicans.
Regulators say failure to provide the money costs the government Dollars 3m
a day; without authorisation to absorb the costs the RTC is unable to close
down the failed S&amp;Ls in its portfolio.
Mr Alan Greenspan, Federal Reserve chairman, joined by Mr Eugene Ludwig,
Comptroller of the Currency, and the acting heads of the Office of Thrift
Supervision and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, urged this week
congressional leaders to delay no longer.
'Failure to provide timely funding for the RTC can only undermine confidence
in the government's willingness to honour its most solemn promises. Those
promises backstop the safety and stability of our entire financial system
and provide incalculable benefits to millions of Americans not directly
involved in the thrift clean-up,' they wrote.
The message was reinforced yesterday by members of a commission
investigating the causes of the S&amp;L crisis, who said the RTC should
immediately be given the money it needs to complete the clean-up.
The commission, chaired by Mr Andrew Brimmer, a former Fed governor, and Mr
John Snow, chairman of the CSX transport company, said in its report that
although the S&amp;L industry was essentially bankrupt by 1982, the government
continued to extend deposit insurance protection while encouraging the
industry to spread into ever riskier activities.
At the heart of the commission's recommendations for reform is a proposal to
limit federal deposit insurance to separately capitalised institutions,
which it calls monetary service companies. These could invest only in
low-risk money market instruments. This would reduce the risk of default
borne by taxpayers and cut the cost of supervision.

FT  28 JUL 93 / Castro to open up Cuba's ailing economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Fidel Castro has indicated that he will pursue further economic
reforms to prop up Cuba's battered economy, including a greater opening to
foreign investment and permitting Cubans to hold foreign currency.
Such proposals did not constitute 'magic formulas', he said, and not all
Cubans would benefit. But 'we are ready to do everything that is necessary
to save the fatherland, the revolution and the triumphs of socialism; that
is to say we will not be dogmatic nor mad'.
Mr Castro, speaking on Monday, the 40th anniversary of a guerrilla attack
that officially marks the beginning of the Cuban revolution, painted a stark
picture of the country's economic plight. He said imports this year would be
just Dollars 1.7bn, against Dollars 2.2bn last year and Dollars 8.1bn in
1991, as a result of Cuba's collapsing hard currency receipts. Bad weather
and fuel shortages caused the sugar crop to fall to 4.2m tonnes this year,
leading to a reduction of about Dollars 450m in sugar earnings.
While the regulation of ownership of hard currency was still under study,
all Cubans would be able to use their foreign currency in specially
designated dollar shops.
When the new laws were passed, Cuba would introduce a national convertible
currency, Mr Castro indicated. Apparently, this will not replace the Cuban
peso as the currency of everyday transactions.
The Cuban government hopes that the measures will encourage exiles to send
dollars to relatives, who will then convert the currency, possibly for
dollar vouchers. In an effort to boost such revenues, Mr Castro said he
would allow more visits to Cuba from Cubans living abroad.
Under US law its citizens can give up to Dollars 300 a quarter to a relative
in Cuba. The US State Department said Cuba's decision to legalise ownership
of dollars would not affect these limitations.
Mr Castro said the government would encourage 'all productive activities and
services that generate convertible currencies', especially in tourism.

FT  28 JUL 93 / Fujimori looks set to 'finish the job'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
PERU'S governing coalition has abandoned an impossibly tight race against
the clock to get a new constitution promulgated by today, national
independence day and third anniversary of President Alberto Fujimori's
assumption of office.
Parliamentary debate over a draft of the constitution is unlikely to be
complete before mid-August. But the chief innovations - which include
allowing the president to stand for a second successive term and the death
penalty for convicted terrorists - already look set in stone.
Both changes to the earlier 1979 constitution enjoy the virtually unanimous
support of the majority alliance in congress, Cambio (Change) 90 and New
Majority, both of which were created to support Mr Fujimori's candidacy.
Both changes are almost certain, therefore, to become law, unless they are
overturned by the referendum which Mr Fujimori has pledged before the
constitution is approved.
Many observers in Lima are convinced that the principal motive behind the
military-backed coup last April, when congress was dissolved and the
constitution suspended, was to ensure that Mr Fujimori could stand again.
Since Mr Fujimori's earliest days in office, military and intelligence
sources have stated their belief that a prolonged period of stable
leadership was needed to consolidate the programme of liberal economic
reforms begun in 1990.
The new constitution is intended to enshrine those reforms, to 'embody very
clear and tremendously precise rules which will attract foreign investors',
in the words of Mr Victor Joy Way, Peru's second vice-president and a former
trade and industry minister. 'We must free economic agents to shoulder
responsibility for the development of the country - the state will no longer
interfere nor intervene, simply orientate.'
While the new constitution will be undoubtedly more 'modern' and
economically liberal than its idealistic, socially-aware predecessor,
lawyers complain it lacks coherence. Many grandly ambitious articles have
been retained because they sound good - or to avoid confrontation with a
vociferous parliamentary opposition. Innovations have been tacked on
piecemeal.
As the draft stands, the legislative body will be reduced to a single,
120-seat chamber. Representatives will continue to be elected via the
traditional - and widely criticised - system of party lists. Reformers had
hoped for the introduction of constituency-based elections to increase both
regional representation and accountability.
The questions of a second successive presidential term and the death penalty
for terrorists have dominated an uninspired national debate, however.
Successive terms for the head-of-state has traditionally been viewed with
suspicion in Peru and other Latin American countries and is unconstitutional
in most.
But the 'Fujimori phenomenon' seems to have wiped clear the collective
Peruvian memory. Mr Fujimori's domestic prestige and approval ratings,
(still around 65 per cent, according to limited urban polls) are uncommonly
high for a president past mid-term. The general feeling is that he should be
given time to 'finish the job'.
Mr Fujimori scoffs at the arguments against successive terms. 'Why should we
follow the traditions of Latin America where corruption and poverty reign?
We must break with taboos . . . modernise . . . look towards France, Spain,
the US and Singapore,' he says.
Introduction of the death penalty for convicted terrorists also appears to
have broad popular backing. Peruvians believe that Sendero Luminoso and MRTA
guerrilla leaders, held responsible for 26,000 deaths and Dollars 22bn in
material damage over 13 years, richly deserve to die. One leading opposition
congresswoman has even spoken of 'necessary social cleansing'.
But the move will put Peru again on a collision course with human rights
organisations. Crimes of terrorism in Peru are summarily heard by 'faceless'
judges in secret military tribunals. Amnesty International recently
expressed concern that, with the death penalty approved, 'prisoners could be
executed . . . following conviction in military trials which fall short of
international standards'.
A last lament from constitutional critics concerns the enhancement of
already wide presidential powers, including the right to dissolve congress,
and to appoint ambassadors and senior military and other officials without
need for congressional ratification.
'This is just what Peru does not need,' commented one senior diplomat in
Lima. 'What Peru should be doing is to strengthen its institutions, not the
person of its president.'
For constitutional expert Mr Marcial Rubio, 'this one . . . will last only
as long as Mr Fujimori remains in power; shortly after he leaves it will be
drastically changed. But that's nothing new in Peru.'

FT  28 JUL 93 / After-effects of 'bubble era' still hinder Japan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S economy is still hindered by the after-effects of the 'bubble era',
which are likely to lead to a weaker than expected recovery, the Economic
Planning Agency warned yesterday in its annual white paper on the economy.
But the agency's confidence that the economy has hit bottom was apparently
challenged yesterday by its director-general, Mr Osamu Takatori, who noted
that recent retail and production statistics have dipped and provide no
reason for optimism.
The white paper, subtitled 'What we learned from the bubble', examines the
longer-term consequences of the easy money era of the late 1980s, and
suggests that the government should have been more aware of the danger of
frenetic speculation and fast-rising asset prices.
In the report, the EPA is generally more optimistic than its
director-general, partly because it was compiled during May and June, when
there were signs of an imminent recovery, including an increase in housing
starts and a halt in the build-up of inventory.
The white paper suggests that the recovery will be evident late this year or
early next year, but concedes that the upturn 'will likely remain more
moderate than past recovery phases, due to sluggish consumption and business
investment'.
That judgment was supported by a 4.8 per cent fall in sales at large
Japanese retail stores in June, compared to a year earlier. The Ministry of
International Trade and Industry said yesterday that June marked the 13th
consecutive month of decreases, the largest period of decline since the
collection of figures began in 1953.
Meanwhile, the Cement Association of Japan said yesterday cement output in
June fell 5.5 per cent following 14 months of increases. The association
blamed the decrease on weak private construction orders, which also led to a
20.1 per cent rise in inventories, now at a record high.
The EPA was hopeful that a 'decline in the propensity to consume seems to
have come to a halt', though it conceded that land prices, which have fallen
an estimated 30-40 per cent in the last three years 'still have a downward
trend'.
The white paper also notes some of the social costs of the bubble era. It
said the distribution of assets in Japan was made less equal, and the
excesses 'lowered the relative value of return for labour'.
On Japan's politically-sensitive current account surplus, which rose from
1.1 per cent of GNP in 1990 to 3.3 per cent last year, the EPA conceded that
the bubble had distorted the initial fall in the surplus. But foreign
investment in the late 1980s had also altered the country's trade structure.
The EPA recommends that the surplus be reduced by the stimulation of
domestic demand, and the creation of an open market, while the surplus
should be circulated 'in a way that would contribute to the development of
the world economy'.

FT  28 JUL 93 / Zimbabwe faces austerity budget
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY HAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   HARARE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ZIMBABWE'S finance min-ister, Mr Bernard Chidzero, is expected to present a
tough budget tomorrow, with cuts in public spending and higher consumption
taxes.
As part of its second structural adjustment loan agreement with the World
Bank, Zimbabwe has promised to cut its budget deficit from more than 10 per
cent of gross domestic product in 1992-93 to less than 6 per cent this year.
Government revenue and expenditure estimates, prepared months ago when
officials were predicting 7 per cent economic growth this year, point to a
9.5 per cent budget deficit of some ZDollars 3.1bn (Pounds 310m), but growth
forecasts have since been downgraded to no more than 2 per cent.
As a result, economists expect the deficit to exceed 10 per cent, though
they expect Mr Chidzero to carry forward parastatal losses of some ZDollars
350m into the current year's budget, thereby keeping the 1992-93 deficit in
single figures.
Government forecasts suggest that revenue will increase to 34 per cent of
GDP from 29 per cent last year, when tax income was cut by drought.
But with the economy likely to remain flat for the first half of the 1993-94
fiscal year (to June 1994), these projections look optimistic. This means
that if Mr Chidzero is to meet the 6 per cent deficit target in the current
year, he will have to cut spending drastically as well as raise new revenue.
The government is already committed to reduce income and company tax rates,
but may seek to dilute these cuts by abolishing some exemptions. Mr Chidzero
is also under pressure from business organisations, and especially farmers,
to reduce import taxes on productive inputs.
Petrol and diesel prices will go up, and drink and tobacco taxes will rise.
Higher duties on luxury goods are possible. In addition, subsidies to
parastatals and defence spending could be cut.

FT  28 JUL 93 / Israel's restless gunners euphoric at a chance to 'hit
back': Julian Ozanne talks to the soldiers who say they have been 'sitting
here taking it like cowards'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

PERCHED on the top of a stony mountain ridge overlooking the rolling valleys
of southern Lebanon, five huge artillery cannons blasted away yesterday,
lobbing shell after shell into Lebanese villages behind the distant hills.
In less than 30 minutes, the young Israeli gunners of Battery B had fired a
deafening 230 shells across the olive groves and tobacco fields towards the
villages of Barasheet and Jibsheet, which the Israelis insist are
strongholds of the pro-Iranian Hizbollah guerrillas.
Israeli warplanes streamed overhead, occasionally breaking the sound
barrier, on their way to strafing and bombing raids.
'My men have been working round the clock. They haven't slept at all since
Sunday,' said an Israeli officer who identified himself as Lieutenant
Colonel 'W', commander of the artillery battalion.
The colonel said his big guns were accurate to within 50 metres. 'The
villagers got a warning we would shell and they have to run away. If they
didn't hear, then that is a problem.'
The army public relations effort has been working hard to sell their
offensive as a limited strike against 'terrorists'. 'We've been sitting here
taking it like cowards,' said one gunner. 'All those villagers who (are
called) civilians are Hizbollah and they are getting what they deserve.'
Several senior army officers were called in at Battery B yesterday, beaming
at colleagues and slapping each other on the back. Many had their
photographs taken in front of the blazing guns and their increasingly
euphoric young gunners.
In a fortified infantry observation post deep in the area of southern
Lebanon which Israel occupies in defiance of UN resolutions, restless ground
troops of the elite Givati brigade urged their generals to let them in on
the action.
'The air force and artillery can't get the job done alone,' said one private
as plumes of smoke rose in the distance above Lebanese villages. 'We are not
trained to sit back and take it and let everyone else have the fun.'
Many of the younger generation of soldiers are hoping the government will
kick Israel's equivalent of the Vietnam syndrome - the fear of committing
ground troops in Lebanon resulting from the disastrous Israeli invasion of
1982 which left at least 650 Israeli soldiers dead.
In the picturesque Israeli resort village of Metulla on the Israel-Lebanon
border, the incessant shelling from batteries all around the town shook
windows and set off car alarms. Israeli politicians, anxious to be
photographed close to their 'boys in action', and army officers and
journalists have replaced tourists in the hotels.
Down the road in Kiryat Shmona, the Israeli town that has been the focus of
Katyusha rocket attacks that killed one Israeli civilian on Sunday, shops
and businesses remained closed and residents stayed close to communal
reinforced bomb shelters for a third day.
Streets were deserted and in the main shopping centre of what has turned
into a ghost town a large speaker blared out up-to-the minute radio reports.
At least 5,000 of the town's 22,000 residents have fled to the larger
Israeli cities of Haifa and Tel Aviv.
Those who have remained play games outside their concrete shelters or sleep
off the afternoon heat on iron bunk beds inside the shelters.
'It is worse than it was in 1982 and everybody is afraid,' said Mr Morechai
Barchechath. 'But everybody here wants the army to clean out the south of
Lebanon.'

FT  28 JUL 93 / Tens of thousands head north in Lebanon exodus 'like 1982':
The road and in the hospitals with the shelling's victims
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TENS OF thousands of Lebanese families deserted villages across south
Lebanon yesterday, 10 or more to a car, and fled north from sustained
Israeli bombardments.
In the biggest exodus in the country since the Israeli invasion of 1982,
traffic was locked from early yesterday in jams along the coast road north.
Cars queued four or five abreast as far south as Sidon, 30 miles from the
capital.
By late afternoon, another stream of cars was heading south, almost all only
with drivers intent on picking up families or friends marooned in villages
undergoing heavy shelling.
Thousands were escaping from a night and day's pounding of Nabatiyeh and the
surrounding villages of Jibsheet and Harouf at a rate of more than 10 a
minute at times. Israeli jets roared over the villages throwing out
anti-radar chaff.
'They don't stop. Every time I breathe I hear a shell,' said one middle-aged
woman on her way out of Nabatiyeh.
In villages a few miles clear of the shelling, families without cars to
escape, or men waiting for a break in the bombardment so that they could
rescue relatives, stood by the road in quiet, surly groups.
Some craned over radios listening to the radio station of the
Israeli-financed South Lebanese Army to hear if it would broadcast a warning
to evacuate their towns - as it did for 20 villages yesterday, each of which
was later shelled.
Roads in the mountains were almost deserted but for saloon cars hurtling
away from Nabatiyeh as shells exploded close to the road. Ambulances wailed
their way to Sidon where the main Hammoud hospital was admitting new
casualties about every 15 minutes by late afternoon.
Many of the injured, like Mrs Hanna Moussa, her two sisters and a shrapnel
scarred nine-month-old child who lay together bandaged in one of the wards,
were clearly civilian casualties. They are also now refugees. 'Our house was
destroyed by the bombs,' said Mrs Moussa. 'This hospital is our home.'
Others, however, were Hizbollah fighters - the ostensible target of Israel's
three-day barrage. In one half-hour spell yesterday, bearded men in
blood-soaked fatigues, some wearing flak jackets, brought in two wounded,
one on a stretcher, his head swathed in bloody bandages, another limping in
with flesh wounds.
Minutes later, a corpse was carried in, poorly wrapped in plastic bags and
sticky-tape, and laid in the hospital entrance. The morgue was full.
'This is worse than 1982,' said Mrs Wassila Abdou, a doctor at the hospital.
'We have more civilians hurt.'
That this bombardment is worse than the 1982 invasion was universally held
by the huddled groups on south Lebanon's roadsides and from families
speaking from the crush of packed saloon cars, or from the back of the
numerous trucks carrying 20 women and children and more.
'The Israelis were attacking just the Palestinians,' said Mr Kamel Kassam, a
car salesman. 'Now nobody feels safe in their homes in the day or in the
night.'
Shelling in and around Nabatiyeh fell over a wide and apparently random
area. Sometimes buildings were hit, sometimes the roadside, sometimes just
scrubland. But plumes of grey or white smoke rose over the centre of several
of the villages visible around Nabatiyeh.
'Ninety per cent of the people have left my village,' said Mr Afif Salameh,
a dentist from Doueir, four miles west of Nabatiyeh. 'There are no Hizbollah
there, they just want Lebanese to leave their villages.'
'This is their aim,' said a Lebanese army colonel, sheltering with his men
in a half-built apartment block overlooking Harouf. 'They want to drive
everyone out of this area, then attack whoever is left. It is like 1982.'

FT  28 JUL 93 / China grooms future leaders: Tony Walker perceives possible
new succession arrangements
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN Mr Qiao Shi, the chairman of the standing committee of China's
parliament, bade goodbye to fellow leaders before his present tour of
south-east Asia, the television cameras lingered perceptibly on an
especially warm exchange with Mr Zhu Rongji, the senior vice-premier charged
with restoring order to China's booming economy.
It was an intriguing moment at a time of considerable uncertainty about
China's leadership succession, and suggested that the shadowy Mr Qiao and
the enigmatic Mr Zhu are not only political allies, but close to each other
personally.
At a time of increasing speculation about the worsening health of supreme
leader, Mr Deng Xiaoping, and with Premier Li Peng's continued absence from
view with a heart condition, the greater prominence being accorded Mr Qiao
and Mr Zhu is pointing to possible new succession arrangements.
Western officials in Beijing note that, for the past few months, talk of a
collective leadership with Mr Jiang Zemin, the party boss and state
president, at its core has been quietly shelved. They attribute this both to
Premier Li's bad health and also to a perceived lack of enthusiasm in any
case for a team involving Mr Jiang and Mr Li, neither of whom is held in
particularly high esteem by the party rank and file.
The emergence of the 69-year-old Mr Qiao, a long-serving member of the
standing committee of the ruling Politburo, coincided with his appointment
in March as NPC chairman. He has used this post skilfully to achieve greater
public prominence, and to champion his pet cause of law reform.
Chinese and foreign observers are now openly canvassing the growing
importance of a 'Shanghai faction' in the leadership centred around Mr Zhu
and Mr Jiang, both of whom are former mayors of China's largest city; and Mr
Qiao who was an underground party organiser in Shanghai in the period before
the 1949 revolution.
Among various leadership scenarios one sees Mr Qiao replace Mr Jiang as
general secretary of the Communist party, Mr Jiang continue as president -
effectively the 'front-man' - and Mr Zhu assume the premiership: that is if
Premier Li Peng's health does not improve.
Mr Zhu's continued rise through the ranks would also depend on success in
his efforts to control the economy. He could hardly expect to rise further
if the economy fails to respond to present attempts to rein it in, and chaos
ensues.
Mr Qiao, who has spent much of a secretive career engaged in internal party
work and in overseeing the country's security apparatus, is referred to by
some Chinese as a 'budaoweng' - one of those bottom-heavy dolls that is
impossible to tip over.
This is a reference to the fact that he appears to have prospered near the
top of the Communist party through many upheavals.
An apparatchik, Mr Qiao is believed to have a strong power base both in the
party itself and in the security services, strengths that both Mr Zhu and Mr
Jiang lack.
Mr Qiao, on the other hand, has been virtually invisible to the wider
Chinese public for much of his career, although he has been close to the top
for at least the past decade.
His three-week tour of Association of South East Asian Nations, which is
being extensively covered in the Chinese media, may well be an attempt to
enhance his public image. Foreign travel has traditionally been used by the
Chinese authorities to burnish the credentials of a potential leader.
Mr Qiao is regarded as a reformist and a supporter of Mr Deng's policies of
economic opening.
In spite of his involvement with security he emerged from the 1989 Tiananmen
episode with his reputation relatively unscathed since it was reported that
he had opposed the use of force to put down the student demonstrators.
It was also suggested at the time that he had been offered, and turned down,
the top party post.
Mr Qiao may now be ready to come in from the cold.

<TEXT>
EFFORTS to settle industrial action at Hyundai, South Korea's largest
conglomerate, hit snags yesterday, dashing hopes that strikes among seven
subsidiaries and their 40,000 workers may end soon.
Workers at Hyundai Mipo Dockyard and Korea Flange rejected, by 2-to-1
margins, proposed pay agreements reached between their trade unions and
management.
Meanwhile, Hyundai locked out workers from the Ulsan plant of Hyundai Wood
Industries, which produces furniture and wood products, after union
representatives rejected a wage proposal offered by the company. It was the
first Hyundai company to be subject to a lock-out during the 53 days of
labour unrest.
Little progress was reported in talks at Hyundai Heavy Industries, the
shipbuilding unit that is the biggest subsidiary still on strike, as the
company insisted that negotiations be confined to pay demands and refused to
discuss reinstatement of sacked unionists.
A scheduled vote yesterday to approve a wage accord at Hyundai Precision &amp;
Industry, which initiated the industrial action at the group on June 5, was
delayed until today due to complaints that workers had not received a full
explanation of the agreement. There are growing doubts whether the
agreement, reached at the weekend, will be accepted.
Workers at Hyundai Electrical Engineering are also expected to vote today on
a proposed accord. A stoppage is also affecting Hyundai Construction
Equipment.
The problems underscore the fact that Hyundai remains a stronghold of labour
militancy, although its workers are among the best paid in South Korea.
Hyundai has concentrated most of its manufacturing in the south-eastern city
of Ulsan, which facilitates collective union action.
A wage accord was narrowly approved last week at Hyundai Motor.

<TEXT>
JAPAN'S Securities and Exchange Surveillance Commission, finally showed its
teeth yesterday as prosecutors arrested an alleged leading stock speculator
and a finance company official for alleged stock price manipulation, writes
Emiko Terazono.
The Tokyo district public prosecutors' office arrested Mr Makoto Araya, a
stock speculator, and a former executive of Sumitomo Fudosan Finance, an
unlisted financing subsidiary of Sumitomo Realty and Development.
Mr Araya is suspected of ramping the stock price of Nihon Unisys, the 32 per
cent owned Japanese affiliate of the US computer group, during 1990 and
1991, through loans totalling some Y55bn (Pounds 344m) from Mr Hiroshi
Kimura, former senior managing director of Sumitomo Fudosan Finance.
The SESC conducted a raid on the offices of Sumitomo Fudosan Finance last
December.
On the Tokyo stock exchange yesterday, fears that investigation by the
prosecutors may spread to Sumitomo Realty and Development depressed its
share price, which fell Y14 to Y706.

FT  28 JUL 93 / Bombings plunge Italy in disarray
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM, HAIG SIMONIAN and Agencies
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME, MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A CAR bomb in Milan, followed just 40 minutes later by two more in Rome,
last night revived the spectre of terrorist violence in Italy and
re-awakened fears of a co-ordinated attempt to destabilise the country.
The Milan bomb killed five people and injured six. In Rome about 20 were
feared injured by the car bombs, which appeared directed at two historic
buildings. The back of the Basilica of St John the Lateran, a former papal
residence, was severely damaged; the other blast occurred by the 12th
century church of St George in Velabro, near the Capitoline Hill.
The bombs followed a similar pattern to one planted three months ago outside
the Uffizi Gallery in Florence, which killed a family of five, and another a
few days earlier in a residential suburb of Rome. The government claimed
that these bore the stamp of the Mafia and dissident elements of the
security services. But no arrests have since been made and no developments
announced. Last night's bombs appeared designed to achieve the same
destabilising objectives.
The explosions come at a time when Italy's entire political structure is
changing, in the wake of a widespread corruption scandal, and when the
country is facing the prospect of early elections and electoral reform.
Leading politicians accused of receiving massive bribes in the
Montedison-Enimont industrial scandal are also expected to be named shortly.
The Milan blast took place just after 11.15pm, as emergency services
responded to an anonymous call which said a car was on fire in the city's
Via Palestro, just outside a former villa once occupied by Napoleon's
family.
A second anonymous call soon afterwards apparently informed the authorities
that a bomb was on board the car, believed to be a Fiat Uno. Three firemen
who arrived at the scene were killed by the eventual explosion, along with a
policeman. The fifth person killed was believed to be a North African
immigrant.
Coming at the peak of the summer tourist season, the bombings look set to
cause the maximum economic damage and create an atmosphere of extreme
tension.
Mr Marco Formentini, Milan's new Lombard League mayor, immediately denounced
the explosions as 'an attempt at intimidation' and pledged a firm response
by the authorities.
Mr Formentini said: 'Certainly someone wants to impede this country's desire
to renew itself. They want to impede the democratic process.'

FT  28 JUL 93 / Bundesbank may cut interest rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GERMAN interest rates could be cut further this week even though inflation
has increased again, economists in Germany argued yesterday, writes
Christopher Parkes. The cost of living in western Germany rose at an annual
rate of 4.3 per cent in the month to mid-July, compared with 4.2 per cent in
June, the federal statistics office reported.
Mr Martin Hufner, chief economist at Bayerische Vereinsbank, noted that in
the previous three months prices had risen at a 'moderate' annual rate of
3.1 per cent, thanks partly to cheaper oil. Though money supply growth still
exceeded the Bundesbank's target range, the rate of expansion was weakening.
Mr Hufner said renewed tension in the European monetary system was an
important argument for a rate cut at the central bank's meeting tomorrow,
the last before the summer break.
The Bundesbank announced yesterday it would accept variable bids from
commercial banks for short-term funds in its weekly money market operation.
Some dealers believe the cost of borrowing short-term funds should come down
today by about 0.15 percentage points to 7 per cent.
The Spanish peseta, Portuguese escudo and Danish krone came under some
selling pressure yesterday afternoon. The French franc weakened slightly
against the D-Mark.

ITALY has bowed to pressure from the European Commission and withdrawn plans
to write off Ecu4bn (Pounds 3bn) of debts incurred by Ilva, the state
steel-maker.
The Italian government's retreat offers a reprieve for the Commission's
ambitious plans to restructure the tottering European steel industry.
The Ilva case remains central to the EC-wide rescue plan. Earlier this
month, the Commission invoked rarely used powers to order Ilva to suspend
its planned write-off of past debt.

FT  28 JUL 93 / Stockbroker seen as main beneficiary of Dublin deals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A PROMINENT Dublin stockbroker was the main beneficiary of a series of deals
which culminated in the controversial Pounds 9.4m purchase of a headquarters
site by Telecom Eireann in 1990, according to the Irish government-appointed
inspector investigating the affair.
In his recently published final report Mr John Glackin, the inspector,
identifies Mr Dermot Desmond as being the key figure in deals which led to
the purchase of a disused bakery site in Dublin by the Irish state-run
telecommunications company for its new headquarters.
Subsequently it emerged that the site had changed hands twice in the 18
months before being acquired by Telecom and that its price had more than
doubled in the process.
Mr Glackin, a solicitor, was appointed in October 1991 to investigate who
controlled and who stood to gain financially from the transactions involving
two offshore companies called Chestvale Properties and Hoddle Investments.
The report deals with the position of Dr Michael Smurfit, the former
chairman of Telecom, who had acknowledged, as he had then recently
discovered, that he had indirectly held a small stake in UPH. UPH had at one
stage owned the bakery site.
Dr Smurfit resigned as Telecom chairman in reaction to a suggestion by Mr
Charles Haughey, the Irish prime minister, in 1991 that he should 'step
aside' pending the outcome of a departmental inquiry into the circumstances.
Mr Glackin concludes that 'none of the Telecom Eireann executives or
directors other than its chairman, Mr Smurfit, were financially interested
in the success or failure (real or apparent) of the companies or able to
control or materially influence the policy of the companies.'
In the case of Mr Smurfit himself, the inspector says: 'I am satisfied that,
save insofar as Mr Smurfit was the beneficial owner of shares, through an
Isle of Man company Bacchantes Limited, in UPH, which I have found was
financially interested in the success or failure of Chestvale between 9th
December and 19th April 1990, he was not financially interested in the
success or failure (real or apparent) of the companies nor did he control or
materially influence the policy of the companies.'
He adds that he did not find any evidence that Mr Smurfit was 'involved in,
or aware of the management or affairs of UPH' and accepts the former Telecom
chairman's evidence that he had no knowledge that his name was being used by
Mr Desmond to help raise finance for the purchase of the site by Chestvale.

FT  28 JUL 93 / Spain seeks accord on budget deficit cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TRIPARTITE talks with employers and unions opened yesterday in Madrid and
are seen as a key test of the government's ability to restore investor
confidence in the troubled Spanish economy.
At issue is whether the government will achieve a negotiated agreement to
contain a spiralling budget deficit and reduce rising labour costs that have
damaged Spain's competitiveness.
'Unless the government courageously deals with the deficit and introduces
flexibility to the labour market, Spain will soon be immersed in a vicious
circle of inflation and devaluation,' said Mr Luis de Guindos, chief
executive of managed funds at Madrid security house AB Asesores.
The talks, which will seek to negotiate what the government calls a 'social
pact for employment', have become more urgent because of the deteriorating
economy and pressure on the peseta.
Officials said the main purpose of yesterday's meeting was to establish a
timetable for the negotiations. Mr Pedro Solbes, the economy and finance
minister who is chairing the talks, has however warned that if no agreement
is forthcoming well before the end of this year, the government will act
unilaterally to cut social spending, hold down wage increases and revise
existing labour legislation.
The government has already proposed a thorough reform of existing laws on
hiring, job classifications and sacking.
Mr Solbes, a non-Socialist in the Socialist party-led government, wants to
reduce the budget deficit, currently running at around 5 per cent of GDP and
nearly double the forecast figure, to 4.5 per cent next year and to 3 per
cent in 1996.
To achieve this the government will almost certainly have to cut back on
social spending and also possibly raise taxes on consumer goods.
Mr Solbes' second task will be to persuade the unions that high wages and
rigidities in the labour market have eroded Spain's competitiveness and are
a direct cause of a dramatic increase in unemployment.
Salary rises this year have averaged 7 per cent, more than two points above
the headline inflation rate. The unions are likely to offer salary
moderation but talks will be tougher over reduced social benefits and
proposed changes to labour legislation.
Mr Solbes has two trump cards. One is that Spain is in its deepest recession
in living memory and that radical measures are required to rectify the
situation.
The minister has forecast below zero GDP growth this year and quarterly
employment figures which will be released later this week are expected to
reveal that more than 100,000 jobs were lost in the past three months,
raising the jobless total to over 3.5m.
The other card is that unless the financial markets perceive that the
government is addressing the fundamental problems of its economy, preferably
through negotiated settlements, the peseta will come under sustained
pressure.

FT  28 JUL 93 / Hedge funds sit on the fence and watch franc
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOREIGN currency dealers have spent the past few days pushing the French
franc close to its floor against the D-Mark in the exchange rate mechanism
and testing the resilience of Europe's monetary system.
But surprisingly there has been little or no speculation by the most
notorious currency players in the market, the New York-based hedge funds.
In the past 12 months, the hedge funds - of which Mr George Soros's Quantum
Fund is best known - have been the most active sellers of devaluation-prone
currencies, like sterling, the peseta and the punt.
But, earlier this week, Mr Soros surprised government officials and currency
dealers by saying that he was not selling the French currency.
The essence of hedge fund activity is to borrow a vulnerable currency in
enormous quantities. The currency is then sold in a minute period of time,
often to a central bank anxious to defend the currency's value in the ERM.
In the past year, this speculation has alarmed the conservative and
long-term participants in the currency market, such as the pension funds,
which have the biggest financial muscle and who are anxious to preserve the
value of their underlying assets. Their selling pushes a currency to levels
at which a devaluation is compulsory. The funds then buy back the currency
at a lower rate, making a huge return.
In this turmoil, however, the conservative pension fund managers - in
particular the holders of French bonds - have been selling the currency
without any prompting from speculators. There is a colossal overseas holding
of French bonds, and fund managers want to preserve the value of these
assets by hedging their currency exposure.
But the hedge funds have been on the sidelines. One fund manager in New York
said yesterday that he did not see the French franc as 'a great value trade'
for him. He said speculators had been reticent in this latest turmoil
because, even if France quit the ERM and cut interest rates, the franc could
quickly appreciate to much higher levels against the D-Mark. France, he
noted, had a stronger current account and trade position than Germany.
Even so, the French authorities have two reasons to be concerned:
The hedging operations of fund managers and international investors could
push the franc out of the ERM if the Bundesbank does not cut rates
sufficiently tomorrow.
According to a leading manager in London, there were flows of around DM100bn
into France and other non-ERM countries after last year's French referendum.
Only 15 per cent of that has been reversed in the past three weeks. Some
hedge funds threaten to be active sellers of the franc in the autumn.
According to one New York based manager, the French currency would be ripe
for a depreciation if the country's interest rates remain at high levels in
the next few months.
'The longer French rates stay high, the more damage will be done to real
estate values and unemployment,' he said. 'An even sharper drop in French
interest rates would be needed - and this could lead to the more pronounced
depreciation in the currency that is sought.'

SERB, Croat and Moslem leaders will hold further talks on a Bosnia
settlement today, after they were reported to have made progress yesterday
in their first face-to-face negotiations for more than six months.
Details of the talks remained wrapped in secrecy as all sides appeared
determined to keep the peace process going. Mr John Mills, the Geneva
conference spokesman, said the 90-minute meeting had 'a good and
constructive atmosphere'.
As the negotiators met, French troops at a United Nations base in Sarajevo
came under artillery fire for the second time in two days. Participants in
the talks agreed to discuss this attack when they reconvene this afternoon.
The talks, which could lead to a carve-up of Bosnia, involve leaders of the
three main ethnic groups along with Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic,
his Croatian counterpart Mr Franjo Tudjman and President Momir Bulatovic of
Montenegro, which with Serbia forms the rump Yugoslav state.
The talks came as international mediators Lord Owen and Mr Thorvald
Stoltenberg tried to persuade Mr Alija Izetbegovic, Bosnia's Moslem
president, to drop his demand that a future Bosnia be based on centralised
federation.
Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, and Mr Mate Boban, his Bosnian
Croat counterpart, have called for creation of a loose confederation, which
Mr Izetbegovic says will lead to more war.
The two peace envoys reportedly told Mr Izetbegovic that a newly created
mainly Moslem state would receive economic aid from Moslem countries as well
as the US. The mediators have pledged, in the event of division, that the
mainly Moslem state would be granted at least 30 per cent of Bosnian
territory and access to ports on the Adriatic Sea and the northern River
Sava.

BOSNIAN President Alija Izetbegovic last night held face-to-face talks with
Serb and Croat rivals for the first time since January as negotiations began
which could lead to the ethnic division of Bosnia.
The leaders of the three main ethnic groups in Bosnia met for unscheduled
talks which included Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic, his Croatian
counterpart Mr Franjo Tudjman and President Momir Bulatovic of Montenegro,
which with Serbia forms the rump Yugoslav state.
The talks came as international mediators Lord Owen and Mr Thorvald
Stoltenberg tried to persuade Mr Izetbegovic to drop his demand that a
future Bosnia be based on centralised federation. Mr Radovan Karadzic, the
Bosnian Serb leader and Mr Mate Boban, his Bosnian Croat counterpart, have
called for the creation of a loose confederation, which Mr Izetbegovic says
will lead to more war and the possible annexation of large parts of Bosnia
to Serbia and Croatia.
The two peace envoys reportedly told Mr Izetbegovic that a newly created
mainly Moslem state would receive economic aid from Moslem countries as well
as the US.
Mr Reginald Bartholomew, the special envoy of US president Bill Clinton who
so far has maintained a distance from the peace talks, yesterday met Mr
Izetbegovic for private talks.
The mediators have pledged, in the event of the republic's ethnic division,
that the mainly Moslem state would be granted at least 30 per cent of
Bosnian territory and access to ports on the Adriatic Sea and the northern
River Sava.
They appear convinced, despite the upsurge in fighting in Bosnia, that Serb
and Croat leaders would be willing to make territorial concessions to the
Moslems.
Serb forces control about 70 per cent of Bosnian territory and the Croats
about 20 per cent.
Mr Izetbegovic is likely to be sceptical that the international community
will provide muscle to back the security of a Bosnian state. But Mr Mustafa
Bijedic, chief of Bosnia's UN mission in Geneva, yesterday said: 'We were
encouraged by the signs of support expressed by the co-chairmen.'

FT  28 JUL 93 / Rouble reform splits cabinet: Finance chief wants central
bank measure overturned

<TEXT>
MR Boris Fyodorov, Russia's deputy prime minister in charge of finance,
returns from Washington today to urge that the central bank's cancellation
of pre-1993 roubles be overturned in order to restore confidence in the
government's handling of the country's finances.
Foreign governments and international financial institutions administering a
Dollars 44bn foreign aid package view the currency debacle as a crucial test
for Mr Fyodorov. As leading minister for financial reform, he needs to
reassert control of the central bank and other financial levers in the fight
against inflation and in order to stabilise the currency.
Mr Fyodorov is aware of the profound unease in US financial institutions and
the US government - which leads the Group of Seven states in providing aid
to Russia - over the sidelining of the finance ministry in the decision. At
stake is the second Dollars 1.5bn tranche of a Dollars 3bn systemic
transformation facility, which will be considered by the IMF in September.
There was a further twist to the already complicated political manoeuvrings
yesterday when Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, announced he had
fired Mr Viktor Barannikov, the security minister, for 'infringement of
ethical standards and serious shortcomings in his work'. Mr Barannikov had
been admonished by the Security Council on Monday for failing to respond
adequately to attacks on Russian guards stationed on the border between
Tajikistan and Afghanistan.
He has now been accused of using 'commercial structures' to send relatives
abroad and his dismissal is a dramatic fall from grace for a man who swung
the power of his ministry, with its thousands of troops and former KGB
operatives, behind Mr Yeltsin in previous crises.
The sacking was immediately contested by Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, the
parliamentary speaker, who accused Mr Yeltsin of 'removing professionals'
from the government. Mr Khasbulatov said he would reconvene parliament to
reappoint Mr Barannikov.
Mr Khasbulatov had earlier blamed the government's 'ruinous monetary policy
 . continued with the persistence of maniacs' for the decision to change the
currency.
Splits in the cabinet over the currency programme came into the open when Mr
Sergei Shakhrai, a deputy prime minister, said the bank's decree had
'sharpened political conflict' in the country. Any benefits from the move
had been outweighed by the social turmoil caused.
Mr Shakhrai warned that the spiral of parliamentary legislation being
cancelled and in turn cancelling, presidential decrees would create a power
vacuum, and with it conditions for the seizing of power by right-wing
'patriotic' forces
However, Mr Viktor Gerashchenko, central bank chairman, said they had no
'vicious plot in mind' in seeking to separate the Russian currency from
those of other republics.

FT  28 JUL 93 / Currency change puts pressure on republics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RUSSIA appears to have achieved the main objective of its currency reform:
Mr Viktor Gerashchenko, the central bank governor, said yesterday the forced
exchange of pre-1993 roubles had compelled former Soviet republics still
using the Russian currency to opt in or out of the rouble zone.
He said republics which had remained members of the rouble zone - using
roubles issued by the Bank of Russia as their only, or parallel, currency -
had to decide whether to stay in or move out. The net effect seems to be to
have whittled the 'rouble core' down to six.
Before last week's currency upheaval five republics had already left the
zone; the three Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, and
Kyrgyzstan and Ukraine. Only the Estonian crown can be described as 'stable'
while the Ukrainian karbovanet has been steadily dropping against the
rouble.
Four more republics have now given notice that they will leave the rouble
zone this year (though in practice these decisions are subject to delay).
Azerbaijan yesterday announced it would leave the zone as soon as possible -
the government has given its central bank two days to work out a mechanism
for withdrawing the rouble and replacing it with the manat - at present a
parallel currency.
Georgia has said that it will introduce its own currency from August. It
currently supplies coupons to supplement roubles and the government has said
citizens have one week to swap roubles for coupons, to a limit of
Rbs100,000.
Moldova has said it will now introduce coupons for all transactions and will
speed the introduction of the leu, which is being printed in Romania.
One problem in Moldova is its large Russian-speaking minority in the
self-styled TransDnestrian republic who have refused to switch to coupons
and still use the rouble.
Turkmenistan is to bring forward the introduction of its manat, from January
next year to October 1993. The manat notes and tenge coins are already
arriving in Ashkhabad, the Turkmen capital and are likely to be valued at
1:1 with the dollar.
Mr Mukhammed Abalakov, the economics and finance minister, said yesterday
the Russian move was a 'stab in the back' for the other republics, and that
they should have been given at least six months notice.
The remaining six republics, including Russia, have opted to remain in the
rouble zone, at least for now. Armenia has made the most fuss - Mr Levan
Barkhudaryan, the finance minister, said the cash exchange was 'a direct
violation of all previous agreements on currencies' but its economy is in
such a dire state that it can no nothing. Belarus has stepped into line, as
it usually does with Russian decisions. Citizens can exchange up to
Rbs50,000, but must put larger amounts in a six month deposit account at an
annual interest rate of 60 per cent. Mr Viktor Danilenko, the Belarus
ambassador in Moscow, rebuked the Russian government, saying that they had
dumped a 'railroad car' full of old notes on Belarus only a day before the
central bank announcement. He declined to say whether Belarus would bring in
its own currency.
Tajikistan and Uzbekistan have both said they will fall into line, although
citizens can continue to use the old notes for the time being. Kazakhstan,
has said it will withdraw the old notes but it is awaiting a sufficient
quantity of new notes before effecting the switch.

</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GREEK public sector unions yesterday began a two-day strike in protest
against government efforts to privatise public utilities, including the
state telecommunications company, OTE.
Banks and post offices across the country were closed, and transport workers
in Athens stopped work during rush-hours. The power company, DEH, warned of
blackouts in the capital.
The unions, backed by the opposition Panhellenic Socialist Movement (Pasok),
have stepped up their campaign against the privatisation programme as the
government prepares enabling legislation that transfers management of
utilities to the private sector and permits them to be listed on the Athens
stock exchange.
The economy ministry, which is leading the privatisation effort, is even
under attack from within the governing New Democracy party, a powerful
faction of which is reluctant to give up the privilege of making patronage
appointments to public corporations.
The ministry's attempt to counter objections to the OTE sale by offering the
company's 28,000 employees free shares has had little impact.

FT  28 JUL 93 / Rome in retreat on steel debts
</HEADLINE>

   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ITALY has bowed to pressure from the European Commission and withdrawn plans
to write off Ecu4bn (Pounds 3bn) of debts incurred by Ilva, the state
steel-maker.
The Italian government's retreat offers a reprieve to the Commission's
ambitious plans to restructure the tottering European steel industry.
The Ilva case remains central to the EC-wide rescue plan. Earlier this
month, the Commission invoked rarely used powers to order Ilva to suspend
its planned write-off of past debt.
The Italian government has since informed the Commission that it is
withdrawing its rescue plan. Italy has until August 14 to put forward
further arguments in favour of state aid, while the Commission has reserved
the right to take the matter to the Council of Ministers.
EC officials warned yesterday that it is too early to declare victory in the
battle to limit state aid to the steel industry, particularly in Italy and
Spain. But in an effort to retain the initiative, the Commission is expected
to agree today to set up a loan scheme to persuade EC steel makers to cut
30m tonnes in capacity.
The Commission has been discussing the scheme informally with steel
companies for several months. The loans would be made available at a
favourable rate to groups of companies which agree to pool funds to finance
capacity cuts.

FT  28 JUL 93 / Italian party looks to past for new image
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE leader of Italy's Christian Democrats (DCs), Mr Mino Martinazzoli, has
managed to paper over internal splits in the party as it prepares to adopt a
new, but as yet ill-defined, identity.
A four-day assembly, ending in Rome on Monday night, gave Mr Martinazzoli
full authority to organise a congress before the end of the year at which
the Christian Democrats are expected to approve a new name: the Popular
party.
This harks back to Italy's first mass Catholic party, dissolved in 1926 with
the onset of fascism and internal divisions. The change, while maintaining
the old party symbol, underlines Mr Martinazzoli's attempt to 'renew without
denying the past'.
The assembly provided few clues as to how the party, formed in 1942,
intended to recover the allegiance of voters disillusioned by the Christian
Democrats' long-standing abuse of power. Partial local elections in June
showed their vote at below 20 per cent.
Preserving unity and ignoring the large number of prominent members involved
in corruption scandals seemed more important than agreeing a political
platform.
The assembly dodged the issue of the 'renewed' party's place in the
political spectrum. Mr Martinazzoli, leader since last October, argued that
the new party should be centrist with strong Catholic roots. Italian
independent road hauliers yesterday called off a strike which had threatened
to throw the country into chaos, Reuter reports. They accepted a package of
tax breaks and tariff increases at a meeting with the prime minister.

FT  28 JUL 93 / IBM takes Dollars 8.9bn charge and cuts 60,000 more jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON, LOUISE KEHOE and ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INTERNATIONAL Business Machines, the struggling US computer maker, is to
slash a further 60,000 jobs worldwide by the end of 1994 - on top of 25,000
already cut this year - and sharply reduce its manufacturing capacity and
office space.
The group yesterday took an Dollars 8.9bn (Pounds 5.93bn) pre-tax charge in
its second-quarter results to cover the upheaval.
Yesterday's action, which included a 54 per cent cut in the quarterly
dividend, is the first major restructuring by Mr Lou Gerstner, who joined
IBM as chairman last April with a mandate for radical change.
Underscoring the problems facing him, IBM also announced that it suffered a
second quarter net loss before special charges of Dollars 40m, or 8 cents a
share, compared with earnings of Dollars 734m, or Dollars 1.29 a share, in
the same period of 1992. With the restructuring charge its net loss came to
Dollars 8bn.
The company said that when fully implemented, the restructuring would save
it Dollars 4bn a year.
The job cuts - roughly one fifth of IBM's workforce - and restructuring
charges were considerably larger than Wall Street had expected, but the
operating losses were smaller than most projections. IBM's shares rose
Dollars 3 1/4 on the New York Stock Exchange to Dollars 45 5/8 in late
trading.
Yesterday's cuts are the largest yet by IBM, which has been cutting staff
for years as it struggles with computer market changes favouring smaller,
nimbler rivals.
Mr Gerstner, whose strategy to restore IBM's fortunes has been the subject
of intense speculation, said his highest near-term priority was 'getting
IBM's cost and expense structure in line with the revenue realities of our
industry.'
His second priority was to 'win the battle in the customer's premises.' This
involved making IBM equipment easier to use and more able to link up with
non-proprietary computer systems.
He was also concerned to boost the morale of employees. However, he warned
that yesterday's cuts were based on current estimates of future demand and
further action could be necessary.
IBM announced at the start of 1993 that it expected to cut its staff of
around 300,000 by another 25,000 this year through voluntary and forced
redundancies.
Yesterday, it said that another 25,000 had now left or were committed to
leave by the end of the year and that some Dollars 2bn of the special charge
covered this rise in numbers.
A further 35,000 jobs would be cut by the end of 1994, requiring some
Dollars 4bn in charges.
Mr Gerstner said the job cuts would be more heavily weighted towards IBM's
operations outside the US.
The remaining Dollars 2.9bn of charges will cover cuts in manufacturing
capacity, office space and related expenses.
Andrew Adonis writes: IBM shed about 2,000 UK employees this year under a
voluntary separation programme which has now ended. Mr Peter Cruttenden,
IBM's UK finance director, said he did not expect further job cuts in the
UK.

FT  28 JUL 93 / Pearson to spin off oil, china interests
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PEARSON, the conglomerate which owns the Financial Times, is to make two of
its divisions into independent public companies as part of its plan to
concentrate on the media and entertainment.
Royal Doulton, the group's fine china division, is to be demerged from
Pearson, probably before the end of this year. The shares, which will be
listed on the London Stock Exchange, will be given to Pearson shareholders.
Pearson will also sell a majority stake in Camco, its US oilfield equipment
and services division, through a public offering on the New York Stock
Exchange.
Pearson said yesterday it would keep a minority stake in Camco 'for a
limited period'. The sale is expected in the first half of next year.
Last year the two businesses accounted for 30 per cent of Pearson's Pounds
1.6bn sales and about 7 per cent of the group's operating profit of Pounds
156m.
Pearson has said for some time that new investments would be in the fields
of information, education and entertainment.
Lord Blakenham, Pearson's chairman and chief executive, said: 'We believe
that concentrating most of our resources now on appropriate sectors in the
media industry will benefit shareholders.'
Pearson said it was holding on to Lazard Partners, its merchant banking
interest, because it was profitable and absorbed neither capital nor
management time.
The initial reaction to the Pearson move was positive and the company's
share price rose by more than 40p before closing up 27p on the day at 467p.
Mr Derek Terrington, media analyst at stockbrokers Kleinwort Benson,
yesterday welcomed the strategy in principle but said he thought Pearson's
shares were still overvalued and that more profit-taking was likely.
The announcement came a day after it became clear that Mr Rupert Murdoch's
News Corporation had beaten Pearson to control of Star TV, the Asian
satellite venture which broadcasts to 38 Asian countries.
Yesterday Mr Murdoch took the opportunity of the higher share price to sell
16.48m Pearson shares through Goldman Sachs at 464p.
The stake represented News Corp's last block of shares in Pearson that are
not covered by convertible arrangements.
Lord Blakenham said the proceeds from the sale of Camco would go towards
investments in the media on an international basis.
Mr Frank Barlow, managing director of Pearson, which recently completed a
Pounds 99m acquisition of Thames Television, said he would not rule out the
purchase of US television stations.
Pearson said it planned to maintain its total net dividend at 12p this year.

FT  28 JUL 93 / Israel steps up attacks on south Lebanon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE and MARK NICHOLSON

<DATELINE>
   ISRAELI-CONTROLLED SOUTHERN LEBANON, BEIRUT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ISRAEL defied international criticism and stepped up its aerial and
artillery bombardment of southern Lebanon yesterday, striking for the first
time at villages suspected of supporting Arab guerrillas.
The intensification of the Israeli blitz on the third consecutive day of
relentless shelling and air attacks forced Mr Warren Christopher, US
secretary of state, to cut short his Asian visit and return to Washington
for 'urgent consultations'.
After a day in which Israel fired more than 5,000 shells into Lebanese
villages, the EC called for an immediate stop to Israeli attacks 'directed
against the sovereignty of Lebanon, its territorial integrity and its
independence and which threaten the peace process'.
President Bill Clinton praised the 'commendable restraint' shown by Syria in
the wake of the Israeli offensive. The White House blamed Iran and
pro-Iranian Hizbollah guerrillas for trying to torpedo the Middle East peace
talks. Mr Christopher still plans to visit the Middle East early next week
to try to persuade the negotiating teams to return to Washington in August.
Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime minister, told a parliamentary committee
the offensive, dubbed 'Operation Accountability', was designed to create a
wave of refugees from southern Lebanon. fleeing towards Beirut. He said he
expected the exodus would increase pressure on the Lebanese and Syrian
governments to curb the activities of Hizbollah, which is responsible for
recent rocket attacks on Israeli forces. He said he expected the raids to
continue for days, not weeks.
In south Lebanon, however, Hizbollah's secretary general Sheikh Hassan
Nasrallah said the guerrillas would not back down.
Tens of thousands of Lebanese villagers streamed north yesterday, clogging
the roads to the capital. Thousands more vehicles headed south to rescue
families.
Mr Rafik Hariri, the Lebanese prime minister, travelled to Damascus for
urgent consultations with Syrian leaders as the toll from the three-day
operation rose to at least 55 people dead and 272 wounded, most of them
Lebanese civilians.
Mr Shimon Peres, Israeli foreign minister, said he hoped a ground offensive
would not be necessary. He claimed Israel had no alternative to continuing
its offensive.
Israeli aircraft also hit a United Nations position south of Tyre yesterday,
wounding four Nepalese peace keepers and damaging 20 buildings. Israeli
officers said they were increasing their target list to 72 villages.
Hizbollah fighters launched seven to 15 122m Katyusha rockets into northern
Israel and a dozen into the Israeli-controlled area of Lebanon.
Mr Peres said he was very concerned about the impact Israel's action was
having on the stability of the Lebanese government but stressed Israel was
at war with the Hizbollah and not with the Beirut government.

FT  28 JUL 93 / CBI adds to pressure for interest rate cut: Survey says
weaker export markets threaten recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, EMMA TUCKER and JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESSURE for a cut in UK interest rates increased yesterday after a report
from the Confederation of British Industry warned that weakening export
markets in continental Europe put the recovery at risk.
The CBI's quarterly survey of manufacturing industry was less positive about
growth prospects than three months ago and said companies remained cautious
about stepping up investment owing to uncertainties about demand.
The tone of the survey has been supported in recent weeks by confidential
assessments of business conditions by the Bank of England and the Department
of Trade and Industry, which have highlighted the threats to an upturn from
export fragility and low UK demand.
The reports have given a strong hint to the Treasury that a cut in interest
rates might be needed to put a firm platform under recovery.
In its monthly monetary report, the Treasury highlighted worries about the
deterioration in the continental European economy while painting a
relatively bright picture of UK prospects.
It said: 'Activity in the main continental European economies seems to have
been flat in recent months, and concerns over the prospect for (continental
European) recovery have increased.' However, the report said the trend in UK
retail sales was strongly upwards, with other indicators pointing to
recovery.
Many economists believe Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, is weighing up a
1 percentage point cut in base rates to 5 per cent, possibly to compensate
for an increase in taxation in the November Budget to counter the
deterioration in government borrowing. This view was behind a switch out of
sterling by investors, causing the pound to fall 2 pfennigs against the
D-Mark to close last night in London at DM2.57, reaching DM2.5722 in late
trading in New York.
Against the dollar, the pound shed more than 1 cent to close at Dollars
1.49, reaching Dollars 1.488 in late New York trading, in while on the
London stock exchange share prices had their best day for 2 1/2 months on
general bullishness about easier borrowing conditions across Europe. Partly
buoyed by theories that the German Bundesbank might cut interest rates at
its council meeting tomorrow, the FT-SE 100 index of leading shares closed
up 35.2 at 2,879.4.
The CBI's survey, a closely followed indicator of UK economic trends, showed
that manufacturers' order books had strengthened in the past four months by
the largest amount since 1990, clearly indicating an upturn.
But while underlining that inflationary pressures remained subdued, the
report showed the substantial growth in manufacturing output and exports in
the first half of the year might not be sustained in the second half.
Pinpointing the CBI's concern that by the end of this year capital spending
by manufacturers on plant and buildings will be about a third down on its
peak in 1990, Mr Howard Davies, the CBI's director-general, said recent
economic trends were 'a matter of concern for the sustainability of the
recovery'.
The reports by the Bank of England are based on its contacts with some 3,600
companies around Britain and are considered by the Treasury as a useful
barometer of business conditions.

</HEADLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SHISEIDO, Japan's leading cosmetic maker, has clamped down on a Tokyo-based
discount retailer, by cancelling shipments from its distribution
subsidiaries. Shiseido said Kawachiya, a successful drinks discounter which
has also started to sell cosmetics, was wholesaling rather than retailing
cosmetics.
However, Kawachiya is planning to file a complaint to the Fair Trade
Commission, the country's anti-monopoly watchdog, next week, claiming that
Shiseido's actions were intended to stop the discounting of its high-grade
cosmetics.
Although resale price maintenance of cosmetic products was cut to 24
low-priced items last year, the industry has traditionally had a tight grip
on retail pricing of its products through its retail network.
Kawachiya, an unlisted company, is one of the first Tokyo-based chain stores
selling alcohol at discount prices, in spite of pressure from alcohol
companies. After strong drinks sales it set up a chain of cosmetics stores
discounting over 5,000 items made by six makers including Shiseido, Kao and
Kanebo.
By selling at 25 to 30 per cent cheaper than other retailers, Kawachiya's
cosmetics sales have jumped ten-fold, hitting other cosmetics retailers.

FT  27 JUL 93 / US urges Asia to help curb N-arms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SINGAPORE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US secretary of state, Mr Warren Christopher, yesterday urged Asian
countries to help curb the spread of nuclear weapons and warned them that
the growing sophistication of their economies meant Asia could become an
important source of equipment for missiles and for chemical and biological
weapons.
'This is a growing problem for Asia because economic and technological
development means the region can now produce chemicals, sophisticated
electronics and other products and services that the proliferators want, but
are now denied in Europe and the US,' he said.
'Asia is at the stage when its participation in international agreements and
establishment of export control regimes are most important.'
He was addressing the annual meeting between the six foreign ministers of
the Association of South East Nations (Asean) and their 'dialogue partners'
from the EC, the US, Japan, South Korea, Australia, New Zealand and Canada.
Asean comprises Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and
Thailand.
The main weapons proliferation problems raised at the talks in Singapore
concern North Korea, which is suspected of having a nuclear weapons
programme in breach of its obligations under the nuclear non-proliferation
treaty (NPT), and China, which is accused by the US of exporting parts for
medium-range M-11 missiles to Pakistan.
Western countries, however, are also worried that Asian companies are
starting to supply lethal equipment and technology outside Asia.
In March a shipment of eight steel reactor vessels which could have been
used for making nerve gas or mustard gas were seized in Singapore on their
way to Libya under a UN arms embargo against Tripoli. They were made in
Malaysia. Libya said the vessels were for making lubricated mud used in oil
drilling.
Several other foreign ministers joined Mr Christopher yesterday in
emphasising the importance of non-proliferation of weapons of mass
destruction, after the first informal gathering on Sunday of a new,
18-member Asia-Pacific forum to discuss security issues.
Western ministers defended their interpretation of human rights and
democracy in the face of criticism from Asean leaders, and called for the
release of Ms Aung San Suu Kyi, the detained Burmese opposition leader.
'Some have argued that democracy is somehow unsuited for Asia and that our
emphasis on human rights is a mask for western cultural imperialism,' Mr
Christopher said. 'They could not be more wrong. In fact, democracy has been
strengthened over the last decade around Asia, in Taiwan and Korea, in the
Philippines and Thailand, in Mongolia and elsewhere. The yearnings for more
freedom are not a western export; they are a human instinct.'
The meeting also moved closer to calling a special meeting to review the
conflict in Cambodia after United Nations peacekeepers leave next month,
Reuter adds.
'Involvement in the post-UNTAC (United Nations Transitional Authority in
Cambodia) political framework would help prevent the unravelling of the
election achievements and develop a constituency of opinion on the need for
the international community to help provide stability in post-election
Cambodia,' Asean said.

Kuwait is preparing a Dollars 1bn claim against Baghdad for cleaning up the
oil well fires that swept the country at the end of the 1991 Gulf War,
Reuter reports from Geneva.
Mr Abdulrahman al-Houty, chairman of the Kuwait government body assessing
damage caused by Iraq's seven-month occupation of the emirate, said the
claim would be presented to a special United Nations body in the next few
days. 'This will be the first of the big claims against Iraq. It has
symbolic importance for us, and we believe it should be given priority
attention,' Mr al-Houty added.
The Geneva-based Compensation Commission has been meeting regularly since
the summer of 1991 and officials say it has already received some 700,000
claims with an expected 500,000 more in the pipeline from individuals, firms
and states.
The total value of all claims is expected to be between Dollars 100bn and
Dollars 200bn, according to experts at the Commission. Mr al-Houty was
speaking in an interview before a three-day meeting of the governing council
of the Compensation Commission.

THE International Monetary Fund has approved a Dollars 86m credit for
Kazakhstan from its systemic transformation facility, a new loan fund
designed to help countries from eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union
make the leap to a market economy, writes George Graham in Washington.
It said Kazakhstan had succeeded in restraining the size of its budget
deficit by improving tax collection, cutting spending and reducing
subsidies, with a deficit target of 6 per cent of gross domestic product
this year.
The Kazakh economic programme aims for a sharp reduction in inflation by the
end of the year, together with an acceleration of structural reforms and a
strengthening of the country's official reserves.

FT  27 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: Gt Portland rights
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After so many of the recent rights issues from the property sector had
achieved take-up percentages in the high 90s, Great Portland Estate's
announcement of a 91.1 per cent acceptance level at first appeared slightly
disappointing. But sector analysts rated the issue a success against what
one specialist described as a highly competitive background.
Great Portland lost 4 to 191p in a turnover of 1.1m. The placement of nearly
10m shares by Cazenove could have had a slight knock-back effect, although
the shares, which comprised the 4.8m rump of the issue and 5m from existing
holders, were spread evenly through the market, said the analyst. The
placing of the shares at 189p was thought reasonable.
Elsewhere in the property sector, trading was subdued. MEPC made positive
ground, rising 6 to 460p. Brixton Estates firmed 3 to 220p.
International trading group BAT Industries moved against the market trend as
dealers continued to focus on last week's news that price cuts from a US
competitor were to be confirmed. Changes in regulation in the insurance
sector were also said to have dampened enthusiasm. The shares eased 2 to
447p in trade of 2.8m.
A feeling that the recent run on food manufacturing shares in general and
those with strong brands in particular was overdone led to a strong showing
in the sector. Cadbury-Schweppes gained 10 at 452p, Northern Foods 5 at
260p, Tate &amp; Lyle 7 at 391p, United Biscuits 7 1/2 at 366p and Unilever 7 at
960p.
There was also a bounce for the much-maligned food retailers. The spate of
recent downgradings - analysts are worried about overcapacity and poor
margins - has led a number in the market to suggest some value might now be
showing in selected stocks. Asda improved 2 3/4 to 64p, Argyll Group 5 to
296p, J. Sainsbury 9 to 467p and Tesco 2 1/2 to 205p.
A squeeze in Burton helped the shares firm 3 1/2 to 74 1/2 p.
Components group GKN was knocked by a double downgrading of profits
expectations. The shares shed 8 to 465p after Hoare Govett weighed in with a
sharp cut in its profits estimates. The securities house reduced the current
year's figure by Pounds 23m to Pounds 112m and the following year's forecast
by the same figure to Pounds 130m, citing continued weakness in the European
automotive market. Nomura added its weight to the negative sentiment.
Hopes of strong sales in the month of August helped motor dealer T. Cowie
move up 6 to 237p. Hoare Govett was said to be negative on BBA, which dipped
1 1/2 to 162 1/2 p.
British Aerospace put on 5 at 409p on further hopes of a favourable outcome
to its negotiations for its regional jets joint venture with Taiwan. Talk of
a big and lucrative order for Airbus aircraft also boosted sentiment in BAe,
which builds the wings for the aircraft and also holds a 20 per cent stake
in Airbus.
Union Discount appreciated 7 to 158p after reporting a recovery in profits.
The discount house said the continued economic upturn would enable it to
reassess the prospect of resuming dividend payments. Interim profits came in
at Pounds 11.3m, against a loss of Pounds 14.8m a year earlier.
Lloyds Bank shares were wanted ahead of figures due on Friday, advancing 9
to 567p.
Among oil issues, Shell Transport finished 5 ahead at 620p after Strauss
turnbull reiterated its buy recommendation on the stock. The broker believes
the company will benefit from group rationalisation currently taking place.
Speculation about a management shake-up at Scottish TV hung over the shares,
which weakened 7 to 509p.
Shares in the life insurance sector remained depressed, following last
week's order from the UK Treasury for new rules requiring companies to
disclose more about their products. Legal &amp; General ended 6 lower at 464p
and Lloyds Abbey Life 3 cheaper at 409p.
Strong interest in a bond issue by Anglian Water led lead manager Schroder
to lift the size from Pounds 60m to Pounds 65m. The money is to be partly
used to refinance the Pounds 36m Nordic Water acquisition. Anglian's shares
slipped 2 to 471p.
The positive sentiment surrounding Hartstone's recent standstill agreement
with its bankers continued to buoy the share price. It rose 4 to 60p.
A fall in profits knocked Merrydown and the shares dropped 16 to 268p. A
bright start for a new Centre Parc site saw Scottish &amp; Newcastle firm 2 1/2
to 432p. Positive press comment on Greenalls was said to have helped the
shares, which ended 5 higher at 356p.
Guinness retreated after LVMH, the French luxury goods group which has a
24.6 per cent cross-holding in the brewer, forecast that its first-half 1993
earnings would drop by a quarter. LVMH said the fall was due to a downturn
in the champagne business. Guinness shares partially rallied later to close
3 down at 444p.
The move by Coats Viyella to issue Pounds 70m of senior convertible bonds
knocked 3 off the shares, which closed at 230p. The company said the issue
would be used to reduce short-term borrowing.
Caution over Emap's remarks last week about the cost of new magazine
launches continued to gnaw at the share price, which fell 9 to 323p.

FT  27 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: Hectic Reuters trade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Reuters Holdings, the international information and news group,
forged ahead in hectic trading after the company confirmed weekend
speculation of a share buy-back scheme.
The company was forced to issue its confirmatory statement, just 24 hours
ahead of its results, saying it was to distribute up to Pounds 350m, through
the repurchase of 5.8 per cent of its ordinary shares at Pounds 14 a share.
The stock raced forward as the big pension funds bought heavily, realising
that the offer was worth around Pounds 17.20 a share to them because of a
tax credit opportunity.
At the day's best the shares were up 56 at 1460p, but they surrendered some
of the gain when US investors failed to follow the lead set by London,
choosing instead to await today's interim figures.
By the close the rise had been trimmed to 36 at 1440p, with volume totalling
6.4m shares, the highest daily total for 2 1/2 years.
Mr Brian Newman of Henderson Crosthwaite expects half-time profits of Pounds
210m. Mr Alastair Smellie at Lehman Brothers predicted Pounds 211.5m and
also forecast a large increase in the dividend.

FT  27 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: Market focus on Boots
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FURTHER speculation over the likely direction of strategy at Boots, the UK
retail and drugs group, inspired another day of hefty turnover in the
shares. Weekend press speculation added to rumours that Boots may be
considering disposing of its drugs research arm, following the decision to
withdraw Manoplax, its top-selling heart drug.
The company has made no comment on the wide-ranging rumours which have
raised questions over the future direction of the company. The situation
gained added spice last night as City analysts met Boots' management to
discuss the question.
Doubts over the future of the drugs arm prompted further concern in the
media over the group's loss-making home products business, Do It All, shared
as a joint venture with WH Smith. One newspaper suggested that the division
would be rationalised and given a more up-market image. However, many
analysts were sceptical, because of the costs of the leases on many of Do It
All outlets.
Do It All has suffered from the intense competition in the home products
market, which has involved frequent price wars and tight margins. Any
attempt to make the business more quality-led and compete with J.
Sainsbury's Homebase would be very fraught, according to analysts.
The speculation boosted Boots' shares, one analyst commenting that 'it shows
that the company is not afraid to consider biting the bullet'. They closed
10 up at 442p in very heavy turnover of 8.5m. WH Smith 'A' appreciated 5 to
444p.

FT  27 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SPIRITS were lifted in stock index futures as interest rate cut hopes gained
momentum ahead of Thursday's meeting of the Bundesbank council, writes
Christine Buckley.
Optimism made a reappearance after a prolonged absence from the market as
dealers became more hopeful that Germany would be forced to reduce its
interest rates to save the European exchange rate mechanism, so creating a
climate more conducive to rate cuts in the UK.
Any market relief at the parliamentary progress on Maastricht was tempered
by concern over the Christchurch by-election.
The September contract on the FT-SE 100 Index began at 2,839 and embarked on
an upward course, reaching the day's peak in mid-morning trading at 2,860.
Apart from interest rate optimism there was some feeling that the contract
had suffered from over-selling in recent sessions and was due for a rally.
That comeback floundered slightly in the afternoon session and September
drifted towards a close of 2,858, with a modest volume of 6,444 contracts
recorded.
Turnover in traded options contracted from Friday's level, with 22,088 lots
changing hands against 27,566. British Steel was the most heavily traded
stock option at 1,630 lots, with much of that action coming from one
purchase of October puts.

FT  27 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: Rate hopes drive rally in blue chips
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DOMESTIC political worries returned to the sidelines yesterday in the London
stock market, which focused on the chances of a cut in German interest rates
this week. Equities took their lead again from the currency markets, and
hoped that Thursday, whatever happens in the important UK by-election in
Christchurch, will bring action on rates by the Bundesbank policy council.
Shares opened firmly, but it was left to the stock index futures market to
provide the impetus which took the FT-SE 100 Index ahead 18.3 by
mid-morning. However, this early level of 2,846 on the Footsie proved to be
the day's best and the rest of the session, while lively enough in terms of
specific corporate features, lacked further development.
Supported well at the close by a 15-point gain on the Dow Industrial Average
in early trading on Wall Street, London finished just under the best but on
a firm trend.
The final reading showed the FT-SE 100 16.5 ahead on the day at 2,844.2. The
index rise was swollen by the strong gain in Reuters Holdings, the global
communications group, which yesterday confirmed reports of a substantial
repurchase of stock on terms generous to current market levels.
The FT-SE Mid 250 Index, the broader-ranging measure of UK stocks, also
recovered ground, ending 12.3 up at 3,215.2. Business in the non-Footsie
stocks increased smartly to make up about 66 per cent of the day's total
Seaq volume of 483.6m shares; but Seaq business was down sharply from
Friday's 539.6m, worth Pounds 1.2bn.
The fall in equity trading volume was seen by many analysts as a warning of
thin times ahead as the summer months take their toll of a stock market
still seeking confirmation of a recovery in corporate profits.
While the standing of Mr Major's UK government remains uncertain and is
expected to suffer a serious setback at the Christchurch poll on Thursday,
attention in the stock market has now moved back to more general prospects
for the British economy.
With the latest data signalling improvement in the domestic economy, and
currency markets pointing to pressure for a cut in German interest rates,
which would imply a further cut in UK rates, equity strategists see the UK
stock market continuing to rally from the lower end of its Footsie 2,800 to
2,900 trading range.
The market was assisted yesterday by renewed support for some of the sectors
badly hit in recent weeks. Pharmaceutical shares extended their gains and
leading oil issues were also wanted by both UK and US buyers.
There was support for the UK bank stocks ahead of the reporting season due
shortly, which is expected to bring confirmation of improvement in profits
and in the bad debt situations leading from the worst days of the property
recession.
Although the strength of sterling is seen as a threat to the export
performance of the blue chip market leaders, investors still chose to
concentrate on the improved likelihood of a cut in domestic interest rates.
However, gains in the store and retail groups were fairly modest yesterday,
with some sector analysts pointing to the heavy pressure of price
competition. Dealers commented that investors were hunting for bargains
rather than chasing underlying value.

FT  27 JUL 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow climbs to new record on
economic data
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US STOCK markets moved into record territory yesterday as investors opened
the week with a burst of buying, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 20.96 higher at 3,567.70, its second
all-time peak in the past week. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 gained 1.99 at
449.09 and the Nasdaq composite 4.30 at 704.54. NYSE volume came to 224m
shares.
Stock prices opened firmer in the wake of strong overseas equity markets and
an early decline in bond yields. The overseas strength came from Europe,
where the main index of German stocks rose 1.3 per cent. In the US bond
market, prices advanced at the start of trading, pushing the yield below 6.7
per cent.
Although bonds later fluctuated between gains and losses, equities remained
higher throughout the day. Stocks were aided by some good economic news in
the form of a 1.9 per cent rise in June existing home sales. By mid-morning
the Dow had broken through its previous record of 3,555.40, set just last
week, and was showing a 20-point gain.
Prices eased back later in the morning as analysts voiced concern that the
markets would struggle to hold their new record levels. In recent weeks,
every time stocks have reached new highs, selling has quickly dragged prices
lower, and analysts fear a similar pattern could be repeated this week.
Stocks ended strongly, however, following a recovery in bond prices.
Among individual stocks, second-quarter earnings reports continued to
dominate. Boeing put on Dollars  7/8 at Dollars 38 5/8 in heavy trading
after the aircraft manufacturer posted stronger than expected earnings of
Dollars 426m. Investors shrugged off warnings from the company about its
near-term business prospects.
IBM initially traded lower ahead of today's expected unveiling of its
second-quarter results, but ended the day up Dollars  1/8 at Dollars 42 3/8
in volume of 3.9m shares. Analysts and investors continued to speculate that
the troubled computer group will announce a fresh charge against earnings,
further job cuts, and possibly a reduced dividend payout.
Cummins Engine, the world's biggest independent manufacturer of diesel
engines, tumbled Dollars 6 1/2 to Dollars 82 1/2 on news of lower than
expected second-quarter earnings.
Mobil firmed Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 72 3/8 after broking house Dean Witter
raised its 1993 earnings estimate for the oil company following its strong
second-quarter results.
On the Nasdaq market, Reuters ADRs climbed Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 65 after
the UK-based financial information group announced plans to buy back up to
5.8 per cent of its shares.
US Healthcare advanced Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 52 following an improvement
in second-quarter profits to 62 cents a share, up from 43 cents a year ago.
Canada
TORONTO ended a three-day losing streak, moving sharply higher in step with
other major world markets. The TSE 300 index surged 39.3 to 3,869.5 and
rises led falls by 407 to 289 after volume of 37.8m shares valued at
CDollars 414.9m. The golds group jumped 4.2 per cent as the New York bullion
price climbed USDollars 3.70 an ounce.

FT  27 JUL 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): DAX closes at highest level
since August 1990
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WITH pressure on the French franc subsiding yesterday attention remained
fixed on Thursday's crucial Buba meeting, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT was lifted by a growing conviction among certain sections of
traders that the Bundesbank will cut interest rates at Thursday's council
meeting. The DAX index gained 23.69 or 1.3 per cent to 1,854.52, its highest
level since August 2, 1990.
Some analysts noted that given that some of the market's strength has been
coming from second and third line issues a period of consolidation may be
approaching.
In spite of the widespread rate cut optimism there is a conflicting view
among some analysts that recent poor economic data - with more expected
during the week - leaves the Bundesbank no alternative but to leave rates
alone until its return from the summer recess.
As Nikko Europe comments in a newsletter released on Friday, 'the money
supply figures showing M3 up 7.1 per cent and this week's inflation figures,
expected to show a year-on-year increase from 4.2 per cent to 4.4 per cent,
further emphasise that, on domestic grounds, an interest rate cut on
Thursday cannot be justified'.
Earlier yesterday some published west German regional CPI figures came in
much as expected.
Viag continued to appreciate following Friday's late news that it could take
a majority stake in Bayernwerk at what is considered to be a 'bargain
price'. The shares gained DM35.00 or 8.5 per cent to DM445.50.
Schering was another stock on the move, up 1.8 per cent on the day, after
the US authorities gave approval for its multiple sclerosis drug. The shares
rose DM15.50 to DM850.00.
PARIS breached the 2,000 level as had been expected, having come close
towards the end of last week on devaluation hopes. With the currency markets
quieter yesterday, the CAC-40 index ended the session 11.18 higher at
2,006.22 in turnover of some FFr2.5bn.
Paribas was one of the day's most active issues, advancing to a day and
year's high of FFr465 before slipping back slightly to close up FFr13.30 at
FFr453.20. Traders could ci te no specific reason for the gain.
LVMH lost FFr55 to FFr3,990, but off the day's low of FFr3,970, after
disappointing first half figures.
ZURICH gained support from a firm dollar and expectations of good
half-yearly results from the banks during the current reporting season and
the SMI index rose 38.3 or 1.6 per cent to 2,388.8.
Nestle, actively traded, rose SFr7 to SFr1,033, while among the banks, UBS
bearers rose SFr32 to SFr1,187, CS Holding added SFr85 to SFr2,850 and SBC
bearers were SFr5 ahead at a year's high of SFr457.
Continued strong demand for cyclicals took Alusuisse registered shares SFr3
higher to a year's peak of SFr533 while Holderbank advanced SFr27 to a 1993
high of SFr764.
MILAN edged lower in turnover that shrank to an estimated L250bn from
Friday's L300bn, and the Comit index dipped 0.84 to 549.33.
However, the slightly firmer tone of the lira and a modest easing of rates
at the Bank of Italy's repurchase tender helped shares to pick up from their
day's lows.
Montedison, the most heavily traded stock, fell L24.3 to L678 ahead of
today's meeting of creditors.
BRUSSELS finished flat after some late index related selling erased modest
gains as currency concerns, high short-term interest rates and worries about
budget talks weighed on the market. The Bel-20 index edged 0.16 higher at
1,307.18.
GIB, the retailer, representing almost one-seventh of the market's BFr940m
turnover, dipped BFr10 to BFr1,256. Clabecq, the steel stock, rose BFr110 or
15.9 per cent to BFr800 after Friday's 16.9 per cent surge.
AMSTERDAM's CBS Tendency index gained 1.3 to 119.2 helped by good rises in
index heavyweights, Royal Dutch, up Fl 1.90 to Fl 180.30 and Unilever, up Fl
1.80 to Fl 189.90.
STOCKHOLM rose on optimism over lower interest rates in the near future
which spilled over into the banking sector. The Affarsvarlden general index
rose 16.7 or 1.4 per cent to 1,171.2.
VIENNA advanced 2.7 per cent to just below its 1993 peak, prompting
expectations that the 19-share index could breach the 1,000-level this week,
in the absence of profit-taking. The ATX index finished 25.52 ahead at
962.42.
ISTANBUL fell almost 4 per cent amid heavy selling in the absence of fresh
news to brighten the mood. The composite index shed 388.96 to 9,370.30,
after last week's 8.08 per cent decline.
Carnegie International notes that the beginning of the first half results
season is beginning to produce reasonable outperformance in individual
stocks; but with money continuing to tighten and no good news appearing on
the political or economic front, the basic direction of the index is likely
to remain downwards.
TEL AVIV recouped early losses to close strongly ahead as the market reacted
to a 2.1 per cent devaluation of the shekel against the dollar. The
Mishtanim index gained 2.93 or 1.6 per cent to 186.14, in turnover of
Shk185m.

FT  27 JUL 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Hong Kong gains 1.6%
after listing of China stock

<TEXT>
BUYING by public funds and investment trusts absorbed arbitrage-related
selling and the Nikkei average edged higher while most investors remained on
the sidelines because of mounting political and economic uncertainty, writes
Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The 225-issue index rose 87.51 to 19,822.08, failing to recoup Friday's 1.9
per cent loss, having fluctuated between a day's low of 19,707.97 and high
of 19,836.68 on index-linked trade.
Volume shrank to 170m shares from 198m. The Topix index of all first section
stocks put on 6.22 at 1,615.55, but declines led advances by 493 to 406,
with 232 issues unchanged. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index was 0.28 firmer
at 1,228.84.
Investors are wary over the likelihood of a non-LDP coalition forming the
new government, given that two splinter groups are poised to join the
coalition to be formed among the five opposition parties.
Further weak economic figures also weighed on sentiment. Department store
sales for June fell 8.9 per cent from the previous year's, while the Bank of
Japan said bank savings by retail customers were rising, reflecting consumer
trends to save rather than spend.
Mr Geoffrey Barker, an economist at Baring Securities in Tokyo, observed
that since a recovery in consumer spending depended heavily on the
willingness of households to run down their savings, lower interest rates,
falling infla-tion and the return of buyers to the housing market were
providing a backdrop for a rise in confidence.
Hopes of lower interest rates supported banks. The bond market moved on
similar speculation, with the yield on the No 145 10-year benchmark falling
3.5 basis points to 4.185 per cent. Industrial Bank of Japan rose Y30 to
Y3,120 and Sakura Bank gained Y30 at Y1,630.
Suzuki Motor weakened Y6 to Y926 on reports that Volkswagen, of Germany, was
likely to withdraw from a mini-car production venture in Spain.
Persistent fears that a bribery scandal could hurt leading construction
companies also affected sentiment. Hazama, already implicated in three cases
of bribery to politicians, dipped Y4 to Y431. Tobishima fell Y13 to Y438 and
Nishimatsu Construction retreated Y4 to Y918.
Speculative favourites saw profit-taking. Nikkatsu, the day's most active
issue, slipped Y1 to Y18 and Gajoen Kanko shed Y18 to Y135.
In Osaka, the OSE average edged ahead 6.71 to 21,842.26 in volume of 6.6m
shares.
Roundup
THE region experienced mixed fortunes yesterday.
HONG KONG rose sharply as selling by overseas funds eased. The Hang Seng
index put on 107.75, or 1.6 per cent, to 6,858.08 in HKDollars 2.52bn
turnover.
Brokers noted that nearly 10 per cent of the total volume was due to China's
state-owned Shanghai Petrochemical, which began trading yesterday. The
shares topped the active list, ending at HKDollars 1.61, against the offer
price of HKDollars 1.58.
Property issues rebounded from last week's falls: Henderson Land climbed 80
cents to HKDollars 20.40 and Cheung Kong rose 40 cents to HKDollars 24.90.
TAIWAN built on Friday's 2.4 per cent rise, the weighted index ending 53.45
stronger at 4,083.87 after an intra-day high of 4,093.74. Turnover amounted
to TDollars 19.8bn.
Paper and construction shares were firmer, with China Steel up 60 cents at
TDollars 20.10.
SEOUL edged higher as buyers concentrated on small and medium-sized
companies. The composite index appreciated 3.24 to 745.07.
MANILA lost ground, the composite index closing 11.68 down at 1,704.10.
Manila Electric 'B' shares rose 5 pesos to 237 pesos while Philippine Long
Distance Telephone shed 25 pesos to 1,070 pesos.
SINGAPORE's Straits Times Industrial index initially fell 17 points on
profit-taking before ending a net 11.46 off at 1,811.62.
Sembawang Shipyard, which is expected to report interim earnings this week,
fell 20 cents to SDollars 11.70.
KUALA LUMPUR declined from the day's high following a rumour about the
health of China's paramount leader. The composite index was finally just
0.70 up at 758.35, after touching 761.60.
AUSTRALIA reversed down through the 1,800 level ahead of inflation and
balance of payments data due this week.
The All Ordinaries index closed 11.1 easier at 1,795.7 in turnover of
ADollars 284.1m.
Among the banks, National Australia relinquished 8 cents to ADollars 10.28
and Commonwealth 6 cents to ADollars 8.68.
NEW ZEALAND finished slightly higher after trading in a narrow band on low
turnover. The NZSE-40 capital index gained 1.82 at 1,725.29 in turnover of
NZDollars 22.8m.
Fletcher Challenge eased 4 cents to NZDollars 2.84 and Telecom firmed a cent
to NZDollars 3.30.
KARACHI continued to climb on settlement day after recording its biggest
one-day gain on Sunday. The KSE index added 20.04 at 1,418.62.

FT  27 JUL 93 / World Stock Markets: ERM tensions cast shadow in Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tensions within the exchange rate mechanism overhung many European bourses
last week, and the pressure seems likely to be undiminished, at least until
Thursday's Bundesbank council meeting.
The FT-Actuaries World index dipped by 0.8 per cent in local currency terms,
with the Pacific Basin showing the weakest performance and Europe flat.
Mr David Roche of Morgan Stanley sees two likely options for resolution of
ERM problems: rate cuts within the ERM or suspension of the ERM and lower
rates.
In his latest review, Mr Roche says: 'The most elegant solution . . . would
be a German rate cut combined with a widening of current ERM bands, perhaps
to 6 per cent, prior to the Bundesbank's summer recess.'
However, during the current ERM turmoil, he expects rising interest rates to
depress the French equity market, particularly the financial stocks. Germany
will outperform most other European markets; Italy may have a temporary
correction; while Spanish equities will remain vulnerable.
Elsewhere in Europe, Austria went its own way last week, the market
advancing 4.8 per cent.
Kleinwort Benson notes that the recent strong rise has followed a pattern
seen elsewhere in Europe, notably in Germany. 'Hopes of economic recovery
have encouraged the buying of export and cyclical stocks,' says its monthly
review. 'In Austria, the rally has been led by the paper, refractory and
chemical sectors. Falling interest rates have helped because of the high
levels of gearing in many of the companies.'
However, Kleinwort warns that although the economy will be helped by tax
reform in 1994, high public borrowing and sluggishness in the German economy
could retard Austria's economic recovery, and therefore the equity market
may have rallied a little too soon.

FT  27 JUL 93 / Money Markets: French rates high
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MONEY market interest rates throughout Europe remained on the high side
yesterday at the start of another critical week inside the European exchange
rate mechanism, writes James Blitz.
Pressure on the French franc subsided as dealers waited to see how the
Bundesbank would respond to the latest crisis in the exchange rate mechanism
at its council meeting on Thursday.
French money market interest rates were more or less unchanged at 9.5 per
cent. But dealers in the interest rate futures market were looking for more
than 2 percentage points off three-month French francs by the middle of
September, with the September Pibor contract closing yesterday at 92.67.
The clear belief is that France will reduce interest rates either because
the Bundesbank has done so or because the French currency has quit the ERM.
There was speculation that the Bundesbank would reduce interest rates at
Thursday's council meeting, but there were wide differences of opin-ion over
the extent of the cut.
Some dealers felt that the Bundesbank would have to lower the discount rate
by a full percentage point to take pressure off the French currency. But the
price of interest rate futures appeared to imply that a 50 basis-point cut
was in the offing.
In recent days, the September Euromark contract has gradually risen from
93.20 to a close of 93.40 last night. This implies that three-month D-Marks
would be at 6.60 per cent by mid-September - and that would imply a
reduction in the German discount rate, currently at 6.75 per cent, of at
least 50 basis points.
Sterling interest rate markets were affected by the currency crisis
yesterday, with dealers speculating that German rate cuts might allow the UK
to ease policy.
In the middle of last week, the December short sterling contract hovered
around the 94.20 level. Yesterday it closed at 94.39, up 6 basis points on
the day. Some dealers believe that there could be  1/2 percentage point cut
in UK base rates later this year.
However, three-month sterling cash was virtually unchanged on the day at 6
per cent. Most of a Pounds 1.65bn shortage forecast by the Bank of England
was removed in the early round of discount market trading.

FT  27 JUL 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Belgians under fire in ERM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BELGIAN and Portuguese authorities were forced to raise their official
interest rates yesterday as continuing tensions inside the European exchange
rate mechanism put their currencies under pressure, writes James Blitz.
The French franc had a respite inside the ERM after two days of intense
speculation against the currency at the end of last week. But the currency
was still close to its ERM floor against the D-Mark at the European close,
and dealers said pressure could re-emerge after Thursday's Bundesbank
council meeting.
Many dealers believe that the Bundesbank must cut its official interest
rates by at least 50 basis points to alleviate tensions. The French franc
closed yesterday at FFr3.414 per D-Mark from a previous FFr3.416. But at
least one London based dealer said that large-scale selling by international
corporates and pension funds was continuing.
The main focus of interest in currency markets was on the Belgian franc,
which saw sharp selling pressure early in the European morning.
The Belgian currency opened at around BFr20.69 to the D-Mark but soon
slipped to a low of BFr20.78. It also fell outside the 50 basis-point margin
which Belgium's central bank has imposed on the franc's parity against the
D-Mark in the ERM grid.
The Belgian franc's fall forced the authorities to raise a series of
official interest rates. Most importantly, the seven-day advances rate was
lifted from 6.7 per cent to 8.5 per cent. This allowed the Belgian currency
to appreciate to a close of BFr20.73 per D-Mark.
The other rate rise in Europe yesterday was by the Central Bank of Portugal,
which lifted its special facility rate by 2.5 percentage points.
In part, this was a response to pressures on the escudo last week. But the
Portuguese authorities will have been concerned by another sharp fall in the
peseta's value yesterday, from Pta79.60 per D-Mark to Pta80.40 at one stage.
The peseta ended at Pta80.15, but the price of this crisis is that Spain
remains unable to cut interest rates as it would like.
The Danish krone closed more or less unchanged at DKr3.8843 to the D-Mark.
But Mr Mark Austin, treasury economist at Midland Global Markets in London,
said a depressing sign for the Danish currency was that it had not enjoyed a
post-weekend rally similar to the one experienced a week ago.
Sterling, the Italian lira and the dollar all continued to profit from the
ERM crisis, with all these free floaters seen as safe-haven currencies.
The British currency rose as high as DM2.5948, its strongest level since the
immediate aftermath of Black Wednesday, before finishing at DM2.5900, up 1
3/4 pfennigs on the day.
The dollar edged up some  1/2 pfennig to end at DM1.7245, bolstered by the
view that the Bundesbank will reduce rates. In New York the US currency also
closed at DM1.7245.

the past decade. But after 10 years of structural adjustment, the country
has yet to receive the promised rewards.
At current growth rates (5 per cent for GDP, 3 per cent for population) it
would take Ghana 20 years to join the ranks of lower middle-income
countries. Only then would the average poor Ghanaian reach the poverty
threshold - defined as two-thirds of today's average consumption per head.
To succeed, the World Bank's African role model must make the leap into
accelerated growth and wean itself off foreign aid by attracting much more
of the private and foreign direct investment that Africa so desperately
needs. Failure to do so would mean, rightly or wrongly, a damaging blow to
the Bank's reputation in the continent.
Little wonder that understandably nervous World Bank officials hurry to damp
down expectations about Ghana's future prospects while stressing the
progress that has already been made. Yes, they acknowledge, Ghana remains a
very poor country (average incomes averaged around Dollars 400 per head) and
relies heavily on foreign assistance. But Ghana's economic performance has
still been impressive over the past decade relative both to the previous 10
years and the rest of the continent.
Real incomes per head have grown by an average 2 per cent a year since 1983;
they fell by 0.4 per cent a year in the decade before the structural
adjustment programme began. GDP growth has averaged 5 per cent a year since
1983; in sub-Saharan Africa the average is 2.1 per cent.
These growth rates occurred while Ghana's terms of trade have fallen
relentlessly. While gross aid flows have averaged 8 per cent of GDP a year,
adjusted for Ghana's large terms of trade losses the net resource transfer
was less than 5 per cent of GDP at its peak, compared to a sub-Saharan
African average of 8 per cent.
In short, World Bank and International Monetary Fund officials argue, Ghana
confirms that structural adjustment is a necessary condition for successful
development. Low inflation, a realistically valued exchange rate, reduced
tariff barriers and the removal of numerous restrictions on investment, have
together delivered much faster growth.
Ghana's experience, they argue, also undermines some common myths about
adjustment. Does structural adjustment require a smaller public sector?
Fewer civil servants, perhaps, but the share tax revenue in GDP has tripled
since 1983. Does adjustment hit the poor harder? The sketchy evidence,
according to Mr Ravi Kanbur, World Bank mission chief in Accra, suggests
that, on average, adjustment has reduced the incidence of poverty by
shifting resources from the richer urban areas to the poorer, rural regions.
But Ghana also demonstrates that successful structural adjustment is
insufficient for an acceleration of economic growth and a rapid fall in
poverty. The obstacles to an acceleration in economic growth to the levels
achieved by the east Asian developing economies over the past two decades
will not be rectified by low inflation and liberalisation alone.
Ghana lags far behind its east Asian competition in all areas of social and
physical infrastructure, as the charts show. 80 per cent primary school
enrolment is high by African standards but low compared to east Asia. And
the capacity of Ghana's civil service to implement reforms remains
disappointing, as Kwesi Botchwey, the finance minister, readily admits.
Most worrying are the low level of private sector investment and the small
share of manufacturing investment in GDP. Last year's balance of payments
does, in fact, suggest that flight capital may be beginning to return. But
inflows of foreign direct investment remain low.
Senior government minsters call for a new 'agenda of activism' to address
these deficiencies. Mr Botchwey stresses the need to attract foreign
investment to supplement Ghana's small pool of domestic private savings and
trumpets the new investment code. He talks of packages of tax cuts and
tariff concessions to attract particular foreign investors.
Meanwhile the Bank of Ghana is using all its powers of moral suasion to
encourage the banking sector to bias its foreign exchange operations towards
export-orientated business and offer cheaper term loans for new investments.
The Bank has made it clear, says one banker in Accra, that 'importing
second-hand cars is not consistent with sustainable development.'
But the government appears undecided about whether to bow to pressure for
infant industry protection, from members of the private sector advisory
group, although the World Bank and IMF counsel strongly against it. 'Free
trade means efficiency but it can also destroy domestic industry,' says one
senior minister.'
Mr Ishmael Yamson, chairman of Unilever Ghana, does not believe in
protectionism. 'It breeds corruption and inefficiency,' he says. 'Most
companies in Ghana asking for protection grew up in a shortage economy and
have never had to justify their investment.'
The missing ingredient is confidence. Senior ministers privately voice
frustration at President Rawlings's occasional outbursts against particular
private companies.
Ghana's experience suggests some lessons for the rest of sub-Saharan Africa.
Bank, Fund and government officials list some possible reasons for Ghana's
success:
Ownership: the Economic Recovery Programme was identified with the
government, not the donors, and ministers took responsibility for mistakes
as well as successes - at each stage, they worked hard to persuade interest
groups that reforms were in their interests;
Sequencing: reforms were carefully staggered - the devaluation occurred well
before imports were liberalised - and not pushed through faster than the
government's capacity limitations allowed;
Aid: donor support was substantial and became available from the outset of
the programme before the government had established a track record.
But the missing element is politics. The military has consistently tried to
align its interests with those of the rural poor rather than the richer
urban elite who probably stand to lose more from adjustment in the early
stages. And the government was able to build an impressive track record,
over a 10 year period, before putting its popularity to the test through
last autumn's elections. An election in 1985 or 1986 may well have delivered
a very different result.
But the Rawlings government won the right to continue for a further term of
four years, in an election which most western observers judged to be free
and fair. That is perhaps the most encouraging sign yet that structural
adjustment might work in Africa.

FT  27 JUL 93 / Survey of Ghana (10): President's new clothes - Politics /
Review of the transition to democracy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LESLIE CRAWFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR 11 years, Flight-Lt Jerry Rawlings, Ghana's military ruler, wore combat
fatigues to work. Since he won a contested presidential election in
November, Mr Rawlings wears suits. The president's new clothes reflect the
changes in Ghana since its transition to democracy: all form and little
content.
The country has the same head of state, key government ministers and ruling
party as before. Economic and foreign policy remain unchanged. Only two out
of the 200 members of the new parliament have previous legislative
experience. And the opposition parties, which boycotted parliamentary
elections in December, are almost as voiceless now as they were under
military rule.
Like most single-party regimes which open up, there is little appreciation
within Mr Rawlings' National Democratic Congress (NDC) of the distinction
between ruling party and state. The president's chief adviser, Mr PV Obeng,
defends political continuity, arguing that the electorate voted for more of
the same. 'We have no wish to experiment with the future of Ghana when we
have tried and tested hands in government,' he says.
President Rawlings' conversion to democracy was sudden but thorough. In a
year a consultative assembly had drafted a new constitution, overwhelmingly
endorsed in a referendum in April 1992. The ban on party politics was lifted
in May 1992 and presidential elections were held in November.
An inflated and inaccurate electoral register probably helped Mr Rawlings
more than his opponents. Professor Adu Boahen, who stood for the
conservative New Patriotic Party (NPP) is still bitter. 'The election was
rigged,' he says. 'Every rule in the game was broken. Votes were miscounted,
our supporters were intimidated. The whole thing was riven with fraudulent,
disgraceful practices.'
The opposition documented the alleged election irregularities in a report
entitled 'The Stolen Verdict'. But they did not think it worthwhile to
contest the results in court.
Instead, they boycotted the parliamentary contest in December. This allowed
Mr Rawlings' NDC to sweep the field. It won 189 out of the 200 seats in the
single-chamber legislature. Other pro-Rawlings parties won nine seats. Two
independents were elected.
The opposition has devoted so much soul-searching to the pros and cons of
the boycott, that little real analysis has been expended on the weaknesses
of their presidential campaign. Professor Boahen's party of businessmen and
intellectuals are contemptuous of the 'arrivistes' who run Rawlings' NDC.
The feeling is mutual. But on economic policy there is little to choose
between them.
So the election was fought on personalities, and here President Rawlings'
dynamism and rhetorical skills gave him the upper hand. 'It is regrettable
that we are not in parliament,' says Mr Bernard Joao da Rocha, the NPP
chairman. 'But we were trapped between two evils: of not having people in
parliament or ignoring the public outcry against the fraudulent presidential
result.'
The opposition has divided into two camps. The 'hawks', led by Professor
Boahen and Mr Komla Gbedena, one of the grand old men of Ghanaian politics,
refuse to confer legitimacy on the new government and will have no truck
with it. Secretly, they hope the government will fall. The 'doves', led by
Mr da Rocha, desperately want to establish a modus vivendi with President
Rawlings and his parliament.
The new legislature is also keen to broaden its appeal by giving the
opposition a voice. The NPP was invited in April to present its views on the
1993 budget. But Mr da Rocha is all too aware that the boycott has placed
his party at the mercy of parliament's goodwill. The opposition says it has
reason to doubt the government's commitment to democracy. Paramilitary
groups have not yet been dismantled. President Rawlings hounds opposition
businessmen with sporadic outbursts. And new laws keep appearing, backdated
to early January, before the new government took office.
The opposition suspects that Mr Rawlings' government continues to legislate
by decree, backdating the laws to by-pass the new parliament. But Mr Obeng
says the late appearance was because of 'printing problems at the government
presses'. He admits, however, that the outgoing military government crammed
a lot of legislation into its final days.
Even from self-exile, the opposition promises to be the 'guardians of the
constitution'. Its main demand is a new electoral register backed by
identity cards to ensure a level playing field in the next elections in four
years' time. They are not daunted by the fact that President Rawlings has
the constitutional right to stand for re-election.
'When your opponent hits you below the belt and the referee pretends that he
doesn't see, do you quit boxing? Or do you prepare yourself better for the
next bout?,' Mr da Rocha asks. 'We survived proscription for 11 years.
Another four won't be our undoing.'

FT  27 JUL 93 / Survey of Ghana (6): Roads to a better life - Cocoa still
dominates agriculture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LESLIE CRAWFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ON the road to Breman Askuma, a small hamlet in the heart of Ghana's cocoa
region, a signpost proudly announces that electricity has just arrived in
this remote part of the world.
Much government and aid agency development work is devoted to improving
'feeder roads' - the dirt tracks, connecting isolated farms to main trunk
roads, which are a lifeline to Ghana's 10m farmers.
Over the next three years, Ghana's donors will be financing a Dollars 106m
project to improve and extend the feeder road network. The deregulation of
farm prices - an important plank in the government's economic reforms - also
had the welfare of rural communities in mind, as farmers now sell their
produce at market prices, instead of controlled ones.
And yet the agricultural sector, which dominates the economy (it contributes
41 per cent of gross domestic product) has stubbornly failed to respond to
the new price incentives and other structural reforms.
Growth rates have averaged only 2.1 per cent a year (below the increase in
population) since 1985, compared with rates of about 7.5 per cent in the
rest of the economy. The government admitted in a recent economic review
that it would be 'a formidable task to raise agricultural output by 3.7 per
cent a year' to achieve its objective of accelerated growth.
Dr Kwesi Botchwey, the finance minister, blames erratic weather conditions
and declining terms of trade for cocoa, Ghana's main commodity export, for
agriculture's poor performance. 'When it rains, we have a glut and prices
fall. When drought strikes, we have a disaster,' he says.
He denies that some of his economic liberalisation policies have harmed farm
productivity. Farmers complain, however, that the removal of subsidies for
fertilisers, and the spiralling cost of imported agricultural inputs because
of the devaluation of the cedi, have placed these vital ingredients beyond
their reach.
The government prefers instead to focus on promoting stronger links between
agriculture and the rest of the economy. The absence of an effective
agro-industrial processing capacity, it says, constitutes one of the main
missing links in Ghana's quest for sustained agricultural growth and
development. And if the agricultural sector is to contribute to the
country's export drive, internationally acceptable quality standards,
including packaging and product presentation, will have to be implemented.
Cocoa, which contributes about 13 per cent of agricultural GDP and 40 per
cent of export earnings, will remain of pivotal importance, despite the
slump in international cocoa prices and fierce competition from East Asia.
Dr KJ Adjei-Maafo, head of the cocoa policy unit at the Castle - the
government seat in Accra - says his main objective at a time of plummeting
prices is to maintain farmers' incomes, as 60 per cent of the rural
population depend on this cash crop. He is doing so by slashing the bloated
bureaucracy of the Ghana Cocoa Board (Cocobod). 'The layoffs have not made
me a popular man, but they were necessary to stave off the collapse of the
industry,' Dr Adjei-Maafo says.
Cocobod's farms and chocolate factories have been privatised, and internal
marketing opened to private sector competition. The government's target is
to put at least 60 per cent of cocoa's market value into farmers' pockets.
Yields last season increased by 44 per cent to 405 kg per hectare. This,
however, is still only half the yields achieved in neighbouring Ivory Coast,
the world's biggest cocoa producer.
Cocobod will remain in charge of cocoa exports, but three trading companies
have been licensed to compete with Cocobod over the purchasing of the crop
at the farm gate. Competition is expected to be fierce, as Cocobod will pay
a takeover fee of 54,000 cedis (Dollars 84) for every ton of cocoa delivered
to port.
The government has set the new producer price for the 1993-94 season at
308,000 cedis (Dollars 513) a ton, a 19.4 per cent increase over the
previous season. Traders are promising to reimburse farmers quickly. Under
the old regime, producers often waited for months for Cocobod to pay up.
The reforms have also revived the moribund co-operative movement in Ghana.
Over 200,000 farmers have joined together to form the Ghana Co-operative
Marketing Association.
Co-op members are both nervous and excited at the challenges ahead. They
have been busy obtaining bank loans to finance their start-up costs, and
have approached aid agencies for help. 'We will only know how good the
business is after the first season,' says Mr Kojo Danso-Mensah at the
Co-op's ramshackle offices above a chicken farming outlet in the heart of
Accra.
Ghana's efforts to give its farmers a better deal have led to a great deal
of smuggling from the Ivory Coast, where the government has slashed its
cocoa purchasing prices to remain competitive. The 'contamination' of
Ghana's premium quality cocoa with its neighbour's inferior stuff is viewed
with understandable apprehension. Smugglers who are caught are being charged
with 'economic sabotage' - a crime punishable by life imprisonment.
The government also hopes to attract foreign investment in oil palm, cotton,
rubber and tobacco. It particularly wants oil palm to be processed in Ghana,
to export a greater value added product. Dr Botchwey says he is prepared to
consider incentives to foreign manufacturers.
Forestry is another sector which the government wants to industrialise. The
most common sight on Ghana's rural roads at present are broken down
articulated trucks, leaning precipitously on the side of the road where axle
shafts have buckled under the weight of enormous tree trunks.
The government and ecologists are worried about the rapid depletion of
Ghana's tropical hardwood forests, and a ban on all exports of raw logs has
been decreed, beginning in 1994. From that date, all timber exports will
have to be processed into sawn wood or furniture parts. (Several operators
in the industry doubt whether the ban will be enforced. There are huge
vested interests in the logging business.)
In addition, Ghana has set aside 16 per cent of its total land area to
permanent forest and wildlife reserves. Outside these areas, the government
rations logging licences.
But the population explosion, with the accompanying demand for food and
fuel, has led to the removal of most of the non-reserved forest. Moreover,
the practice of selective logging, which concentrates on a few choice
species, has also contributed to deforestation and degradation. Furniture
manufacturers complain that Aphromosia, the prized white teak, has become
extinct in Ghana.

FT  27 JUL 93 / Survey of Ghana (7): Production quadruples - Gold is now the
biggest earner
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ADAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'THIS mine will bring in new revenue, foreign investment and help the whole
area to develop,' said President Jerry Rawlings at the opening in February
of the Iduapriem gold mine in Ghana's western region, marking the latest
development in the industry's continuing expansion.
No sector of Ghana's economy provides such striking evidence of the benefits
of economic reform as the country's thriving gold mines.
Liberalised mining investment laws have attracted Dollars 900m of new
capital and helped to quadruple the country's gold production to 1m ounces a
year since 1986, putting the mineral above cocoa as Ghana's leading export.
Export earnings this year are expected to exceed Dollars 375m, compared with
Dollars 343m last year, and Dollars 304m in 1991. Furthermore, if the
Ministry of Energy and Mines plans are fulfilled, production will double to
2m ounces a year by 1997.
Central to the revival of the sector has been the Minerals and Mining Law of
1986 which brought in a new wages and income policy for mine workers,
coupled with the efforts of the Minerals Commission which liaises with
foreign investors. In the privatisation programme under way the government
hopes to raise Dollars 100m by reducing from 55 per cent to 35 per cent its
stake in the Ashanti Goldfields Corporation (AGC), a joint venture with
Lonhro, the British conglomerate.
Ashanti is one of the richest gold deposits in the world; it accounts for
nearly 80 per cent of Ghana's gold exports. It has a total concession of 256
square kilometres; its deposits are extensive and high-grade. AGC's reserves
average eight grammes a ton, helping to keep production costs within the
lowest 15 per cent in the world.
An independent assessment of Ashanti's existing and proposed operations,
carried out by James Askew Associates of Perth, Australia, has established
proven and probable reserves of 9.1m ounces of gold, or a 10-year mine life.
The International Finance Corporation has helped to syndicate a Dollars 140m
loan, beginning a 10-year investment worth about Dollars 555m to develop
Ashanti.
The Ashanti Mine Expansion Programme (AMEP) is designed to raise its output
to 1m ounces a year by 1996, drawing on the latest techniques in sulphide
mining and metallurgy in order to develop large sulphide deposits adjacent
to some existing deep mine and open pit operations.
Meanwhile the gold deposits of the western region of Ghana are also
attracting investors. The Iduapriem mine, about 300 kilometres west of
Accra, is owned and operated by Ghanaian Australian Goldfields (GAG), a
joint venture between Golden Shamrock Mines (68.95 per cent), the
International Finance Corporation (20 per cent) and the Ghanaian government
(10 per cent).
Golden Shamrock is the Australian group controlled by Mr Oren Benton's
Concorde group, based in Denver, Colorado, which trades 70 per cent of the
world's uranium.
After an initial investment of Dollars 10m by GAG, the International Finance
Corporation connection helped the company to raise a Dollars 55m loan from a
syndicate made up of Swiss Banking Corporation, the Netherlands' ING bank,
the German and Dutch aid finance agencies DEG and FMO, and Ecobank, the West
African regional trade bank. The mine began producing last September and is
producing gold ahead of its target rate of 120,000 ounces a year, worth
about Dollars 46.8m at the mid-July 1993 price of about Dollars 390 an
ounce.
The new open cast mine contains an oxide ore body with about 2 ounces of
gold per bulk ton and GAG expects it to yield about 1m ounces of gold by the
end of this decade. Golden Shamrock hopes to use the GAG as a base for
further mining ventures in Ghana - or elsewhere in West Africa.
A few kilometres from the site is the old Prestea mine, where Gold Fields of
South Africa bought a controlling interest in January - following closely
after another acquisition from the state authorities, the old mine at
Tarkwa, by Newmont of the US. The Prestea mine now run by Gold Fields has
larger (but much deeper) sulphuric ore deposits than Iduapriem, but
under-investment had made the mine uneconomic for many years.
Although gold seems set to retain its leading role, diamond earnings will
pick up, say industry officials. Output from the main producer, Ghana
Consolidated Diamonds Ltd - about 150,000 carats in 1991 - is projected to
rise five-fold over coming year.
Manganese exports remain below the 1974-75 peak of 638,000 tons, but
rehabilitation of the Ghana National Manganese Corporation's mine has
increased production from 159.000 tons in 1983 to 364,000 tons in 1990.

FT  27 JUL 93 / Survey of Ghana (8): Scanstyle - furniture from the forest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LESLIE CRAWFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF GHANA is going to make a go of export-led growth, it will need more
companies like Scanstyle Mim, a small furniture manufacturer working in the
heart of Ghana's tropical hardwood forest.
Scanstyle's main contact with the outside world is through a crackly radio
transmitter. The national electricity grid only reached the factory in Mim
last year. Yet Scanstyle is responsible for more than 90 per cent of Ghana's
furniture exports. Its earnings are small - Dollars 6m last year - but
growth potential is huge.
The company's turnover has grown six-fold since 1982. And in added value
terms, Scanstyle's furniture earns five times as much as the same volume of
unprocessed timber. So why aren't more loggers branching into the furniture
business? 'Because,' says Mr Kwabena Pepera, the company chairman, 'logging
earns more money with less risk. If a consignment of furniture is rejected,
you risk bankruptcy.'
Many Ghanaian companies find it difficult to export because they cannot meet
the quality standards demanded by overseas customers, he adds.
Local manufacturers often have little knowledge or experience of marketing
abroad.
Ghana is not yet geared to providing pre-export finance, or long-term
capital for investment in plant and machinery. Scanstyle shows how obstacles
were overcome. The company was set up in 1968 by a Norwegian who spotted an
opportunity to use the offcuts of a large sawmill in Mim. In the early
1980s, frustrated by government curbs on his business, he decamped to
Singapore, leaving a knowledge of the European furniture market and the
quality standards required.
'Under the old government controls,' Mr Pepera recalls, 'we could not export
a single chair. But we had Lebanese traders coming from the Ivory Coast and
paying cash to smuggle our goods through the jungle.' Life for exporters has
become easier. Export and import licenses have been abolished; foreign
exchange controls scrapped; and the cedi has been devalued, making Ghanaian
exports more competitive abroad.
With the help of a Dollars 400,000 Japanese loan, the company has bought
computer controlled lathes from Italy which will allow it to tackle more
complex furniture.
It trains its personnel abroad, and has opened a sales office in London to
be closer to its clients. Scanstyle's biggest market is the UK, where its
garden furniture and chairs in tropical hardwoods - white teak, mahogany and
other species with mysterious African names - are highly prized. The company
also exports to Germany, Italy and Ireland. It has not been able to break
into the American market because it cannot yet match the size of the orders.
'Our main constraint is a shortage of raw timber,' Mr Pepera explains.

FT  27 JUL 93 / Survey of Ghana (4): Tough budget to curb excesses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD BALLS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LITTLE did Ghana's electorate know, as they voted in last December's
parliamentary elections, what surprises President Rawlings and senior
cabinet ministers had planned for the first few months of the new civilian
administration.
Within hours of Mr Rawlings's inauguration, Kwesi Botchwey, finance
minister, announced a frighteningly tough 1993 budget package of tax
increases and spending cuts designed to restore order to Ghana's
deteriorating public finances after the excesses of the election year.
The need for decisive action is readily apparent from the large gaps between
last year's targets and the actual budget outcomes for 1992. The government
began the year expecting to achieve a small budget surplus of 1.8 per cent
of gross domestic product. But the combination of poor revenue collection
and a 45 per cent increase in the civil service salary bill meant that, by
December, this surplus had turned into a deficit of 4.8 per cent of GDP -
5.9 per cent excluding foreign grants.
This year's ambitious budget package is designed to restore the budget to
surplus in one year - the government's declared strategy is to close the
budget gap quickly, to prevent inflationary expectations becoming
entrenched.
The centrepiece is a 60 per cent increase in the price of premium petrol -
C1000 to C1600 a gallon (Dollars 2.50 at current exchange rates). Speed and
administrative efficiency meant that this was preferred to an early
introduction of the government's planned value-added tax. It will account
for almost two thirds of budget balance improvement.
The remaining tightening is expected to come from improved cocoa revenues,
better tax collection and proceeds from privatisation. The government
expects to raise cedi 60bn - 1.5 percentage points of GDP - from
divestiture. Thirty companies are up for sale, but the government can meet
its targets in one stroke if the partial sale of its stake in Ashanti
goldfields proceeds.
Opposition reaction to the budget was rapid. The NPPaccused the government
of 'aggravating the economic hardship of a people already burdened by a
decade of austerity measures' and called on the parliament to use its powers
to reverse the petrol price increase. It argued that this was both
regressive and unlikely to yield the government's revenue targets and
suggested an alternative package of luxury import duty levies, excise taxes
on cigarettes and alcohol and expenditure cuts.
Western observers in Ghana say the petrol price increase should be
progressive.
The volume of petrol sales dropped 10 per cent in the first four quarters of
this year but projected petrol tax revenues appear to be on target. Even so,
the government budget plans look highly optimistic. Unless corporate and
import tax revenues recover markedly and divestiture occurs as planned, this
year's petrol price increase will not meet the government's ambitious
revenue target of 17.5 per cent of GDP this year, up from 11.1 per cent last
year.
Meanwhile, the spending targets assume that the government succeeds in
freezing civil service salaries in a year in which consumer price inflation
is expected to average 20 per cent. If spending does accelerate, or if
revenue collection proves disappointing, a further rise in petrol prices
cannot be ruled out.

FT  27 JUL 93 / Survey of Ghana (2): A blot on the copybook - Edward Balls
explains last year's economic turbulence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD BALLS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NO ONE was surprised when 1992 turned out to be both a turbulent and a
disappointing year for Ghana's economy.
On top of severe budgetary pressures linked to last year's transition to
civilian rule, Ghana also suffered a 21 per cent fall in cocoa earnings, its
main export commodity.
The result was a year which blotted the last page of the military
government's copybook on the 10th anniversary of Ghana's structural
adjustment programme.
1992 began with the government's finances in apparently good shape. A
three-year extended structural facility with the International Monetary Fund
ended in 1991 with the budget in surplus to the tune of 1.5 per cent of
gross domestic product.
Inflation had fallen to 10 per cent, from a peak of 142 per cent in 1983
when the government's Economic Recovery Programme began. And a succession of
balance of payments surpluses since 1987 had enabled the government to build
up a healthy pile of foreign exchange reserves, covering more than four
months' worth of imports. By the time last November's presidential election
finally took place, all these indicators had moved sharply in the wrong
direction.
A projected budget surplus of 1.8 per cent of gross domestic product became
a deficit of 4.8 per cent; the government was forced to borrow from the
banking system, the broad money supply grew by 51 per cent and inflation
accelerated to 13.3 per cent by year-end.
The outside world can take only part of the blame. The decline in cocoa
prices - and thus the sharp drop in Ghana's terms of trade - was the main
reason for the deceleration in economic growth. Agricultural output declined
by 0.6 per cent and total output growth slipped, as a result, to 3.9 per
cent in 1992 from 5.3 per cent in 1991, the first year since 1983 in which
Ghana has underperformed the developing country average.
A combination of the shortfall in net foreign transfers and the fall in the
terms of trade produced a net outflow of resources last year, as the chart
above shows.
Yet the main reason for last year's inflationary overshoot and balance of
payments problems was profligate budgetary management in the run-up to last
autumn's elections as the government succumbed to political pressures, much
to the anger of President Rawlings' defeated opponents.
Government tax revenues were markedly lower than forecast, the reason being
half-hearted tax collection and lax enforcement of customs duties. But the
bulk of the slippage occurred on the expenditure side of the budget as the
government bowed to pressure from civil servants in the weeks before the
election and grant what amounted to an across-the-board salary adjustment
averaging 80 per cent.
Poor fiscal management is not uncommon in election years in the developed
world. That the government resorted, to some extent, to pork-barrel politics
might conceivably have been interpreted as an early sign that the transition
to civilian rule and western-style democracy was on track.
But the donors did not see things that way. As imports accelerated and
export growth slumped, aid flows from the World Bank were suspended, the
civil service reforms stalled and the government was unable to finance its
rising current account deficit. The result was a sharp loss of reserves and
a steep fall in the value of the cedi exchange rate.
The highest priority for the newly elected government this year has been to
get the macro-economy back into balance in order to ensure a favourable
spring report from the International Monetary Fund, and a warm embrace from
the aid donors at the recent Paris conference.
Ghana, while far from being the largest recipient of aid among African
countries, remains heavily dependent on gross aid flow totalling 8 per cent
of GDP a year.
Fiscal policy has already been tightened sharply to bring the budget back
into surplus, primarily through a 60 per cent rise in petrol prices. The
government is projecting a recovery in revenue collection and an
acceleration in the pace of the politically sensitive privatisation
programme. But success will depend on the willingness of the civil service
unions to accept a nominal pay freeze this year, although last year's
excesses and the January petrol increase pushed the annual rate of inflation
to 23 per cent in March. Inflation is not expected to fall below 20 per cent
this year.
Monetary policy has been tightened aggressively to drain excess liquidity
from the banking system - broad money in 1993 should barely grow. The Bank
of Ghana, having shifted last year from credit ceilings to open market
operations and weekly debt issues, increased its rediscount rate in March.
But credit creation in the first quarter was still excessive and in April
the Bank imposed a supplementary reserve requirement of 15 per cent of
assets on top of the usual 42 per cent.
Bankers in Accra say they are impressed by the effectiveness of the Bank's
domestic operations and monetary conditions are now, reportedly, painfully
tight. Less impressive has been the operation of the foreign exchange
market. Shortages of foreign exchange mean that the proposed interbank
market is not working. Banks are forced to hand out the foreign exchange
they receive as deposits, sharpening the incentive to engage in
export-oriented business.
Thus, domestic conditions provide, at least for now, an inauspicious base
from which to launch the government's campaign to accelerate economic growth
to 8 per cent a year by the end of the decade. Indeed, the target of 4.4 per
cent GDP growth this year looks highly optimistic.
The medium-term challenge is to achieve a sufficiently rapid rate of
economic growth to reduce the incidence of poverty and wean itself from aid
flows. The focus of reform has shifted to initiatives designed to raise
standards of primary health and infrastructure, improve the efficiency of
the civil service and streamlined state sector and make Ghana a more
attractive and profitable location for domestic and foreign private
investment in order to encourage the growth of non-traditional export
industries (see Page 4).
The government plans to press ahead with privatisation this year. This
year's budget announced, for the first time, that profitable state
enterprises will be sold off, and senior Ministry of Finance officials
confirm that they intend to privatise the state-owned banking sector.
Meanwhile the Ghana Investment Centre is being restructured as an investment
promotion centre (rather than the distributor of operating licences and thus
one of the economy's most inefficient bottlenecks). The proposed Ghana
Investments Promotion Centre will have the job of publicising the
government's new investment code, drawn up with the Private Sector Advisory
Group.
The code is designed to reduce the minimum foreign participation in joint
ventures to Dollars 10,000, and Dollars 50,000 if the operation is wholly
foreign-owned, unless the enterprise is a trading venture only.
Moreover, the code streamlines registration procedures for foreign joint
ventures; guarantees repatriation of profits, dividends and fees in respect
of loans and technology transfer agreements; guarantees a right to legal
redress and fair compensation in the event of compulsory acquisition; and
raises the quota limitation on expatriate staff.
But the short-term test is whether the government can restore macroeconomic
stability and maintain it while the civilian democratic political system
takes root.
Last year, Ghana failed that test and tried its donors' patience. Only if
the government is able to fight another election campaign in four years
without resorting to economic populism will the reforms begin to look
secure.

FT  27 JUL 93 / Survey of Ghana (5): Deficit goes up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD BALLS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LAST year's economic difficulties show clearly in Ghana's balance of
payments. A projected current account deficit of 3.2 per cent of gross
domestic product became 5.5 per cent of GDP by year end. Combined with a
shortfall in aid flows, this deficit converted a projected balance of
payments surplus into a deficit of 1.8 per cent of GDP.
The international environment is partly to blame. The dollar price per ton
of cocoa fell by 5 per cent compared to the previous year, although
production volumes were also unexpectedly depressed - 243,000 tons against a
projected 262,000 tons. The significant decline in Ghana's terms of trade
meant that, while total export volumes grew 4.6 per cent, values fell by 1.1
per cent.
Poor export performance was compounded by excessive imports: values grew by
10.5 per cent last year, twice as fast as expected. The surge mainly
reflected pre-election expansion in government and consumer demand.
The result was that the Bank of Ghana lost a third of its foreign exchange
reserves. By the year-end they had fallen to Dollars 346.5m, 2.6 months of
imports, from 4.1 months of imports at the end of 1991. The cedi depreciated
from 390 cedis per dollar in the final quarter of 1991 to 520 cedis per
dollar in the fourth quarter of 1992 and had fallen towards 650 cedi per
dollar by the middle of this year.
The government does not expect the current account balance to improve this
year.
While imports are projected to grow by 4.2 per cent, exports values are
expected to rise by a disappointing 2.9 per cent: largely the product of
continued weakness in world cocoa prices.
The government hopes that cocoa production will recover to 280m tons,
exceeding last year's projected levels, but earnings are expected to fall by
a further 10 per cent. The result is a projected deterioration in the
current account deficit of 5.9 per cent of GDP.
Debt service payments will also jump this year, consuming a projected 37.7
per cent of export earnings as principal repayments become due, before
falling to 24 per cent next year and 25 per cent in 1995. Outstanding debts
remain equal to 58 per cent of GDP. While the burden of debt service
payments has fallen from its mid-1980s high of 57 per cent of export
earnings, it remains a substantial drain on the country's domestic
resources.
Hence the World Bank's calculation that Ghana would need external financing
of Dollars 1.7bn over the next two years.
The donors have obliged, deciding last month to increase aid flows above the
World Bank's minimum. This should bring great improvement in the capital
account this year; it should return the balance of payments to surplus and
enable reserves to be rebuilt.
The government is confident that it can achieve its target of a balance of
payments surplus of Dollars 167.5, 2.6 per cent of GDP and rebuild its
reserves to over Dollars 500m by the end of 1993, 3.7 months of imports -
assuming that the budget remains on track and that the cocoa harvest is
good, too.

FT  27 JUL 93 / Survey of Ghana (1): Determined to press on - Ghana has
blazed a trail in Africa, implementing economic reform while managing the
transition to civilian rule. The toughest test may lie ahead, as the
government seeks domestic and foreign investment vital for export-led growth
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
IN a continent full of strongmen propped up by sclerotic regimes, Flight-Lt
Jerry Rawlings, Ghana's leader since 1981, stands out for his shrewd ability
to adapt to changing times - which may explain his enduring popularity.
Last January Mr Rawlings effected the transition from military dictator to
elected president with the same apparent ease as he abandoned revolutionary
Marxism a decade ago to become the model pupil of the International Monetary
Fund. His timely conversion to democracy spared Ghana the suspension of
international aid that which has crippled other, less-adaptable African
nations. But Ghanaians could be excused for believing that little has
changed.
They have the same president, almost the same government team and economic
policies as before. The new parliament, dominated by Mr Rawlings' National
Democratic Congress (because there is an opposition boycott), has yet to
prove it can be an independent counterpoint to the president's authority.
And many of the democratic safeguards enshrined in the new constitution,
such as a human rights commission and an independent press council, have yet
to be put in place.
Most western observers judged the election to be relatively free and fair,
but some Ghanaians, particularly the educated elite in Accra, argue that
donor governments, desperate for a success story in Africa, turned a blind
eye to unfair rules of the game that gave Mr Rawlings an unbeatable
advantage. The electoral register, inflated by more than 1m names, was
seriously flawed, and the opposition had been legalised barely six months
before the election - hardly enough time to organise an effective campaign.
It was a contest, they say, in which Mr Rawlings was the star player,
linesman and referee. In protest, the four main opposition parties, ranging
from the socialist followers of Ghana's founding father, Kwame Nkrumah, to
the conservative New Patriotic Party (NPP), boycotted the parliamentary
elections in December. It is a decision they now deeply regret. Their
self-exclusion from parliament has left them almost as voiceless as they
were under military rule. Furthermore, seven months into the new regime they
are still bickering among themselves over how to survive in the political
wilderness.
Some, such as Mr Bernard Joao da Rocha, the NPP chairman, favour a policy of
reconciliation with the Rawlings government. He asked, and obtained,
permission to submit his party's views on the 1993 budget to parliament.
'The fact that we boycotted the parliamentary elections does not render this
government illegitimate,' Mr da Rocha concedes. 'Our only hope of
influencing policy is to establish a dialogue with the party in power.'
But Mr da Rocha's pragmatism jars with the bitterness harboured by other NPP
stalwarts. Professor Adu Boahen, the NPP presidential candidate, refuses to
accept the results of the contest he lost. 'I will never recognise Rawlings
as a legitimate leader. I have no wish to accord respectability to his
government,' he says.
If Ghana's democratic transition requires a leap of faith, then greater
faith still is needed to believe that after a decade of economic reforms,
the country is ready to make the qualitative leap into accelerated,
export-led growth.
Having spent the past 10 years trying to repair the damage caused by
socialist mismanagement in the 1960s and 1970s, Dr Kwesi Botchwey, Ghana's
veteran finance minister, believes the country is sufficiently recovered to
shift its focus from reform to active development.
His accelerated growth plan, unveiled at a Paris meeting of donors last
month, is bold in conception. The target - to achieve 8 per cent annual
growth rates by the turn of the century - is ambitious. Ghana is hoping to
model itself on the newly industrialised nations of south-east Asia.
If it succeeds, 10 years of liberalisation, deregulation and devaluation
will have been vindicated. And the World Bank and the IMF, struggling to
convince sub-Saharan Africa of the benefits of structural adjustment, will
have a new development example on the continent.
For the plan to work, Dr Botchwey is betting on a revival of manufacturing,
believing that a leaner, export-oriented manufacturing sector can rise from
the ashes of structural adjustment.
The accelerated growth plan calls for non-traditional exports (everything
that is neither cocoa, gold nor timber) to grow by 29 per cent a year
throughout the 1990s. Investment and domestic savings ratios will have to
improve substantially to sustain higher growth rates. And the sluggish
agricultural sector, which has suffered from the collapse of cocoa prices
and erratic weather conditions, will have to be prodded into greater
productivity.
Dr Botchwey's plan was overwhelmingly endorsed at the donor conference,
which pledged a further Dollars 2.1bn in assistance over the next two years
 -almost half a billion dollars more than the government had bargained for.
There are reasons for optimism. Since Ghana began to swallow the IMF
medicine in 1983, gross domestic product has grown by an average of 4.9 per
cent a year, more than twice the sub-Saharan average of 2.1 per cent. It
follows a decade during which real incomes per head in Ghana fell by 30 per
cent.
Yet Ghana remains desperately poor. Its average per capita income was only
Dollars 400 last year. Low wages have led to an exodus of Ghanaian
professionals. There are fewer doctors in Ghana now (one for every 15,000
inhabitants) than in 1975. The World Bank estimates that at current growth
rates, it would take 20 years for the average poor Ghanaian to cross the
poverty line.
Hence the urgency to push for accelerated growth. A recent World Bank
strategy document entitled 'Ghana 2000 and beyond - setting the stage for
accelerated growth and poverty reduction', estimates that if growth rose to
8 per cent, then the average poor Ghanaian could cross the poverty threshold
in 10 years.
Ghana's fast-track development plan has a second, equally important
objective: to wean itself off aid dependence by attracting new foreign
investment and diversifying exports. Dr Botchwey says there are 'real
signals' that this is already happening. 'A number of multinationals who
quit in the 1970s are coming back,' he argues. 'They are looking at the
comparative labour costs and are interested in producing on a large scale
for export. There is tremendous scope for rapid expansion in agro-processing
industries and in wood processing.'
And yet Ghana's private sector success stories in export diversification
remain limited.
One company accounts for 90 per cent of Ghana's furniture exports. Another
company produces most of Ghana's fruit juice exports. Pineapples are proving
to be a lucrative alternative to cocoa, but only because they have been able
to displace the more expensive produce from neighbouring Ivory Coast.
Some multinationals which are encountering quota problems in the Far East
have expressed interest in setting up manufacturing plants in proposed
industrial incentive zones. But few investments have yet materialised.
While the private sector in Ghana agrees with the broad thrust of the
government's policies, there is much scepticism over its implementation. 'If
we think that small manufacturers can suddenly become exporters, we are
dreaming,' says Mr Ishmael Yamson, chairman of Unilever Ghana. 'We need to
attract multinationals on the basis that they can come to exploit our cheap
labour and natural resources.'
Local manufacturers, Mr Yamson says, have little knowledge of export
markets. They lack managerial skills and are starved of long-term domestic
sources of finance. The government's Export Promotion Council has been
ineffective in selling Ghana abroad, while a couple of venture capital funds
set up last year have yet to lend a single cedi to budding entrepreneurs.
Mr Yamson places more hope in a new trade and investment programme launched
by US aid and other donors, which aims to provide the services and know-how
that potential exporters need. The government, for its part, is introducing
'a new agenda of activism' that will target investors with special
incentives. 'Picking winners is a hazardous thing,' Mr Botchwey concedes, so
he has asked the private sector to draft guidelines for the selective
protection of infant industries.
'The protection measures will have to be time-bound, the criteria clear and
transparent, to avoid charges of political favouritism,' he explains.
Whether all this can add up to accelerated growth remains to be seen. Much
will depend on the government's ability to maintain a healthy macroeconomic
environment.
Last year, as Ghana prepared for the presidential election, the government
was frightened into granting large pay increases to striking public servants
who were on strike. The government's wage bill rocketed to 50 per cent of
public revenues, derailing the delicately balanced budget. Inflation rose to
10.1 per cent in 1992 against a 5 per cent target. The World Bank and
co-financing donors withheld Dollars 170m of development assistance. And
overall economic growth slowed down to 3.9 per cent.
Dr Botchwey moved swiftly to close the budget deficit by imposing a new
'killer tax' on fuels in January. Meanwhile, the Bank of Ghana (central
bank) sharply jacked up its discount rate to bring the money supply under
control.
Inflation, however, is not expected to fall below 20 per cent this year.
1993, therefore, is being billed as a year of belt-tightening and
retrenchment. Western diplomats in Accra do not expect the economy to take
off again before 1995.
But the determination is there to press ahead. And while the ink may still
be fresh on Ghana's accelerated growth plan, the document marks a
psychological turning point in the nation's history. By underscoring its
faith in its own potential, Ghana is shedding its image as a victim of an
unjust world economic order.

US farms

FOR THE first time in weeks meteorologists have good news for American
farmers in the drought-stricken south-east and flooded midwest.
Sunday brought a healthy rain to the south-east crops and forecasters at the
US Department of Agriculture predict the next ten days will bring normal to
above normal rainfall.
In early trading yesterday soyabean prices on the Chicago Board of Trade
sank about 15 cents a bushel to Dollars 7.11. Mr David Asbridge, an analyst
with the American Soyabean Association, said he did not expect prices to
fall as much as the 30 cents limit, which would shut off trading for the
day.
Dr Norton Strommen, a USDA meteorologist, said that the rains in the
south-east should slow the crop deterioration that had been brought on by
unseasonably high temperatures that began in June. Farmers may not be out of
the woods yet because long-range forecasts are indicating higher than normal
temperatures and lower than normal levels of precipitation.
'I don't see any signs of permanent relief from the drought,' Mr Strommen
said.
In the midwest rain will not stop entirely, but it should return to levels
normal for this time of year. With nearly 16,000 square miles of the best
farmland in the US under water and flooding likely to continue even if the
rain does let up, the USDA is looking primarily to non-flooded regions where
rains slowed or prevented planting and more rain now would damage the crops
already in the ground.
The rain has been particularly damaging in Iowa, the largest maize-producing
state in the nation; Kansas, the biggest producer of wheat; Nebraska;
southern Minnesota and western Illinois.
In early July USDA lowered estimates of maize and soyabean production to
capture losses due to crop abandonment and planting problems, but there is
little concern about commodity shortages because of large stocks on hand at
the beginning of the harvest and good crops elsewhere in the country.
Some agricultural regions, such as the eastern corn (maize) belt, have
actually benefited from the rainfall. About 78 per cent of Indian's maize
crop and 76 per cent of Ohio's are considered to be in 'good to excellent
condition'. Maize is also flourishing in eastern Illinois.
The drought in the south-east may affect cotton production, analysts say,
but the USDA has not formally lowered crop estimates. The crop was expected
to be the biggest since 1937, because of the larger amount of planted
acreage reported on June 30, and production was expected to top 17m bales.

FT  27 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Ping fails to win support for
Opec price action
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
MR JEAN Ping, president of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting
Countries, flew home to Gabon yesterday after a tour of the Middle East
having failed to reach any agreement among the ministers he visited for Opec
action to prop up the oil price.
Mr Ping's visit was prompted by expectations that Iraq would soon return to
the export market after talks with the United Nations in New York. He
scheduled an emergency meeting for this Wednesday, but was persuaded by Mr
Hisham Nazer, the Saudi oil minister, to postpone it.
No date has been set for another Opec meeting and ministers continue to
snipe at each other's overproduction. The pressure has been taken off the
organisation by steady oil prices and the fact that talks between Iraq and
the UN have not yet resumed.
Iraqi negotiators are still in Baghdad although they are expected in New
York to resume talks within the next two weeks. Oil prices have barely moved
for several days as traders wait to see what will happen in the Iraqi
negotiations.
'I think the market over-anticipated how soon Iraqi oil would come back and
now prices are on hold until there is more action from either Iraq or Opec,'
said Mr Joe Stanislaw, consultant with Cambridge Energy Research Associates
in the US.
The North Sea Brent crude price for September delivery rose 16 cents
yesterday to Dollars 16.81 a barrel.

FT  27 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: MIM acquires stake in
Queensland copper/gold mine
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
   Kenneth Gooding, Mining Correspondent
MIM HOLDINGS, the Australian natural resources group, is moving closer to
its aim of becoming one of the world's big copper producers by acquiring 51
per cent of the Ernest Henry copper/gold deposit near its base in north west
Queensland for ADollars 80m (Pounds 36m).
Ernest Henry, one of the richest mineral discoveries in Australia in recent
years, has been at the centre of an ownership dispute that ended abruptly at
the weekend.
Analysts suggest that the outcome is severely embarrassing for Western
Mining Corporation, one of Australia's biggest groups, which discovered the
deposit in 1991 jointly with Hunter Resources on a group of six leases owned
by Savage Resources, a small coal and exploration company.
A judge in the New South Wales supreme court ordered an adjournment on
Thursday and told WMC to consider its position 'at the highest level' after
a WMC executive had admitted the company misled Savage about exploration
work carried out at the Ernest Henry site. Settlement of the dispute has
enabled MIM to buy a majority stake in Ernest Henry from Savage.
WMC's share price fell sharply on the court revelations which came only a
few months after the group was also strongly criticised and ordered to pay
costs of more than CDollars 10m by a judge in Nova Scotia, where it had sued
directors of Seabright Resources, a gold company it acquired during a
takeover spree in North America in 1987.
MIM had manoeuvred itself into a position to take a substantial stake in
Ernest Henry whatever the outcome of the court battle. The deposit, which
consists of at least 69m tonnes of ore containing an average of 1.6 per cent
copper and 0.8 grams of gold a tonne, is near MIM's Mount Isa base where it
has extensive mining and copper smelting operations.
MIM will also acquire Hunter's 30 per cent interest in the nearby Mount Fort
Constantine joint venture - WMC has the remaining 70 per cent - for ADollars
17.5m.
Mr Norm Fussell, talking to the Association of Mining Analysts in London
yesterday, said growing its copper operations was MIM's present 'priority
target'. The group aimed to mine 200,000 tonnes of copper a year and to
smelt 250,000 tonnes, the capacity of its Townsville refinery.
The stake in Ernest Henry and another prospect, Eloise, near Mount Isa,
would enable the group's growing smelter capacity to be used 'and will
average down our overall production cost.'
He said it would take at least three years to get Ernest Henry into
production.
MIM's longer-term aim was 'to double our global influence in copper to
400,000 annual tonnes, while improving our competitive position'.

FT  27 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: US gold production to rise by 5
per cent
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
US GOLD production will rise by 5 per cent compared with 1992 to 10.3m troy
ounces this year, according to Metals Economics Group, the Canadian
consultancy concern, which based its forecast on company projections. This
follows a 14 per cent or 1.2m ounce jump last year, nearly half of which
came from a doubling of production at American Barrick Resources' Goldstrike
mine in Nevada. Nevada continued to dominate US gold output last year with
48 mines producing 6.5m ounces or two-thirds of the total. California's 14
mines produced just over 1m ounces.

GOLD moved ahead in late trading on the London bullion market after Comex
futures prices advanced early with the entry of a big fund into the market.
New York analysts were divided over the possible effect on the market of
Sunday's massacre of 11 churchgoers in South Africa. Some said the market
had disregarded the violence, while others attributed gold's advance to
concerns that the violence might escalate. COPPER traded in a narrow range
on the LME, ending in the plus column. Factors such as possible strikes in
Peru and drawn-out labour talks at Kennecott were seen as peripheral.
Tightness in the September delivery month was again the driving force, but
there was little activity on this front. Three-month ALUMINIUM met some
support around Dollars 1,215 a tonne. News that workers at Alcan's Kitimat
smelter are to vote on a new contract deal later this week, and that work is
carrying on, suggests that a stoppage is unlikely. New York raw SUGAR prices
came under pressure from the continuing lack of news in the cash market.
October fell in heavy midsession trading to 9.11 cents a lb - the lowest
level from an active contract in nearly six months.

FT  27 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Indonesia is not giving up on
natural gas 'pipe-dream' - Problems hindering development of a giant field
in the South China Sea
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM KEELING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE POTENTIAL Dollars 20bn development of the Natuna field has kept the gas
industry enthralled since its discovery 20 years ago in the South China Sea,
about 1,100km north of Jakarta, the Indonesian capital.
With 45 trillion (million, million) cubic feet of recoverable hydrocarbon
reserves, the field could support long-term contracts for 14m tonnes a year
of liquefied natural gas, equivalent to nearly 25 per cent of 1991 world LNG
production. It would confirm Indonesia - which last year shipped 23m tonnes
of LNG worth Dollars 3.7bn to Japan, South Korea and Taiwan - as the
industry's world leader.
In early July, however, Pertamina, Indonesia's state-owned oil and gas
company, pulled out of more than two years of negotiations with Exxon
Corporation of the US for Natuna's development. Pertamina and Exxon both
have a 50 per cent stake in the field.
Exxon requested at the weekend that negotiations be reactivated. But there
are many people within the gas industry who consider Natuna a pipe-dream
project. Mixed with its recoverable gas, the field has 70 trillion cu ft of
carbon dioxide, which would need to be separated and reinjected into the
sea-bed. Offshore facilities - the field is in water 145 metres deep - would
total 700,000 tonnes of steel, 910 km of pipeline and 2.6m horsepower of
turbine machinery.
Industry officials say, however, that the sticking point of negotiations has
not been the project's technical feasibility but fiscal terms such as the
production split after cost-recovery and the tax regime under which the
field would operate.
Exxon is also report to have requested a sovereign guarantee for its
investment to cover force majeure risk, a first for an oil and gas project
in Indonesia. As a Jakarta oil executive explains, 'If Natuna were to go
sour, even for a company as big as Exxon it would have a dramatic effect'.
With the project facing potentially insuperable problems, Indonesia must now
assess the future of its gas sector without Natuna. Jakarta has been deft at
marketing LNG in Japan, where its exports of over 18m tonnes last year
accounted for 60 per cent of the market. Demand is expected to rise further
as Japan replaces its nuclear power stations with gas-fired plants.
South Korea is also a growing market with an increase in demand forecast
from 4m tonnes this year to nearly 12m tonnes by the year 2000. As an
industry executive in Jakarta notes, in Asia 'all the indicators point to
pretty good growth potential'.
Indonesia, however, may not be able to capitalise fully on the growing
market. Last year, Pertamina's Arun plant in North Sumatra produced about
12m tonnes and a further 11m tonnes came from its Badak facilities in east
Kalimantan.
Oil companies say proven reserves in Kalimantan dedicated to Badak are about
30 trillion cu ft. Improvements to Badak, including completion of a Dollars
750m sixth unit or 'train', will boost its capacity to 14m tonnes next year.
A seventh train, with a capacity of 2.4m tonnes, is under consideration.
Reserves at Arun, however, are running down. Industry officials forecast a
gradual decline in production from a peak of 1.8bn cu ft a day in 1989 to
1.5bn cu ft by 1998 and then a sharp fall to less than 900m cu ft daily in
2000.
Arun supplies on long-term contracts that begin to expire in 1999 and will
be concluded by 2008. After that date, industry officials expect only
minimal production from Arun.
The failure of Pertamina and Exxon to reach agreement does not signal an
immediate crisis for Indonesia's LNG industry, for, as one Jakarta oil
executive notes, even 'without Natuna, Indonesia does have some reserves
which do buy them time'. Unless significant new reserves can be brought on
stream, however, the forecast rise in LNG production to 28.5m tonnes a year
by 1997 would be followed by a decline toward 20m tonnes by 2010.
Some oil companies are bullish about the prospects of finding new gas
reserves but say, despite incentives being improved three times in the last
five years, that the fiscal regime covering Indonesia's oil and gas sector
stifles exploration. The government may improve incentives again, however,
to prevent a long-term decline in LNG exports and to guarantee supplies for
the fast-growing domestic market.
By 1997 at least eight gas-fired power plants with a capacity exceeding
6,000MW are planned on Java and a gas network in the industrial city of
Surubaya in East Java is being constructed.
A recent government study proposed exploiting 79 small and medium scale
fields with reserves totalling about 8.4 trillion cu ft to feed the domestic
market. But these are expected to be depleted by 2004 and, should new
reserves not be discovered, the government might have to redirect gas from
the export- to the domestic-market.
This further underlines the importance of the Natuna field which, in
addition to servicing exports contracts, could provide a fall-back position
for the domestic gas sector.

FT  27 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: West African rice boom poses
problems for researchers - A deepening funding crisis is hampering efforts
to boost indigenous production
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MADELEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RICE IS booming in West Africa, with a growing number of people switching
from traditional cereals, which take hours of preparation, to opt instead
for a food they can put straight in the cooking pot.
Once considered a luxury, rice has become the chief staple food and major
source of calories for some 70m of West Africa's 200m people. Output in the
17 countries that make up the region has risen by more than 5 per cent a
year since 1980, doubling to a record 6.6m tonnes last year, the highest
increase for any of the major cereal crops.
The popularity of rice in West Africa, particularly among urban dwellers,
means that consumption has shot up at an even faster rate than output,
exceeding 9.5m tonnes in 1992. Some 3m tonnes had to be imported last year
at a cost of Dollars 600m, putting a severe strain on scarce reserves of
foreign exchange.
While countries in the region are trying to encourage yet higher output, and
cut down on imports, farmers are facing a number of problems that could put
a brake on expansion. Rice is still a relatively new crop in West Africa and
high-yielding varieties suitable for the region have yet to be developed. A
research institute, the West Africa Rice Development Association, based in
Bouake, Ivory Coast, which is trying to develop improved varieties of rice
and encourage sustainable farming practices, is facing a funding crisis.
Warda, which was set up in 1970, was recently forced to close one of its
stations in Sierra Leone because of the withdrawal of funds by USAid, The US
government aid organisation. Two other research stations, at Bouake and at
Saint Louis in Senegal, are down to skeleton staffs.
The World Bank, one of Warda's largest donors, last year cut its annual
funding from Dollars 1.785m to Dollars 1.5m, while the European Community
slashed support from Dollars 532,927 to Dollars 324,000. Only two of the
regions's 17 countries contributed funds for Warda's research, despite their
interest in producing more rice from their own fields.
'If the countries who spend so much money importing rice, divert only a tiny
fraction for us to do research it would help solve the problem,' said the
association's director-general, Dr Eugene Terry.
A panel of rice experts that conducted a review of Warda's work said that it
had been 'reduced close to the level of critical mass, and in some aspects
may already be below it. This is an extremely serious and urgent situation'.
Most rice in West Africa is not grown in Asian-style paddies but by small
farmers in upland areas without the benefit of irrigation. Africa's existing
upland rice varieties are hardy but yield less than a tonne per hectare,
compared with a global average of about 3.5 tonnes. Upland farmers in West
Africa who apply fertiliser are averaging more than two tonnes a hectare,
but fertiliser is not widely available.
When Warda was first established, it concentrated on adapting high-yielding
rice varieties developed in Asia, Latin America and elsewhere to West
African conditions. It was hoped that these varieties could give Africans
the benefits Asians were enjoying.
But Warda admits that this approach proved 'misdirected'. In the hot dusty
winds and extreme temperatures of West Africa the Asian varieties fared
badly, and researchers are now trying to improve local varieties.
Higher yielding varieties could have an important environmental spin-off,
enabling farmers to allow longer fallow periods in between rice cultivation.
Much of the expansion of rice output in West Africa has taken place because
farmers have shortened these fallow periods, but at the risk of serious land
degradation.
Researchers point out that provided the right varieties can be found there
is considerable potential to expand the output of rice from West African
inland valleys. These valleys cover about 19m ha, and rice now only grows on
about 5 per cent of them.

FT  27 JUL 93 / Government Bonds: Stronger pound dispels concerns about gilt
prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, PATRICK HARVERSON and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A SHARP rise in sterling against the D-Mark helped lift UK government bond
prices yesterday, temporarily dispelling concern that gilts might have
peaked.
Gilts were stronger along the yield curve, although they held gains better
at the long-dated end. Ten-year gilt futures for September opened at 108
5/32 and rose more than half a point before easing to close a net  3/32
higher on the day.
Sterling's gains, prompted by the view that the UK is a safe haven from the
turmoil within the European exchange rate mechanism, disguised some of the
doubt creeping into the market ahead of tomorrow's Pounds 3.25bn gilts
auction.
Continued support for the market at all levels was matched by sellers,
particularly later in the day when prices retreated in the face of
profit-taking.
Although the buyers remain, there are fundamental political worries ahead of
the Christchurch parliamentary by-election. Dealers were watching the level
of sterling against the D-Mark with interest, saying that if the pound was
perceived to be overvalued investors would sell it back and that weakness
could not come at a worse time for the gilt auction.
Much depends on the outcome of the CBI industrial trends survey due today.
If that shows any inflationary trends, that could hit the market.
REGIONAL cost-of-living figures in Germany pointed to a year-on-year rise in
inflation from 4.1 per cent to 4.3 per cent.
However, the markets decided that the Bundesbank would have to cut interest
rates to save the ERM, and bund prices were firm yesterday, although the
bund futures for September eased to close 9 pfennigs higher at 96.27.
Nevertheless, there was a general shift from last week's view that the
Bundesbank would be unable to ease to a consensus that it would have to
reduce the upper level Lombard rate and the discount rate, which sets the
floor for German lending, if the ERM is to survive.
FRENCH bond futures opened at 120.36 and shot up to 120.60 as investors
decided that whichever way Germany falls at its Bundesbank council meeting
on Thursday, France will have to slash rates to rescue its faltering
economy.
However, the contract slipped back and closed marginally lower on the day,
as did five and 10-year cash bonds after the early enthusiasm gave dealers a
chance to take profits.
OAT September futures ended at 120.24.
AMONG the high yielding countries, Italian government bonds tested their
historic high as the lira rebounded against the D-Mark. Italian September
bond futures hit a high of 104.82 and closed 0.31 up on the day at 104.42.
Spanish debt prices were easier ahead of an auction of three-year, five-year
and 10-year paper later this week. Portuguese bonds slipped back after the
central bank raised its one-day lending rate by 2.5 points to 14.5 per cent.
US TREASURY prices rebounded from early losses yesterday to end higher as
dealers covered their short positions ahead of this week's auctions of new
government securities.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  1/4 at 105,
yielding 6.679 per cent.
At the short end of the market, the two-year note was unchanged at 99 7/8 ,
to yield 4.175 per cent.
The dominant influence on the market yesterday was supply considerations.
The Treasury is due to sell Dollars 16bn in two-year notes today, and
another Dollars 11bn in five-year notes tomorrow. Much of the activity
during the day involved dealers preparing their positions for that new
supply.
There was little else to affect business. The day's only economic news - a
1.9 per cent rise in June existing home sales - was bearish for bonds, but
the extent of the gain was insufficient to trouble prices.
SALOMON Brothers bid to buy an undisclosed amount of Polish Treasury bills
at a primary auction yesterday, becoming the first foreign investor to enter
the market, Reuter reports from Warsaw.
'This is the first foreign investor in the bills. This should be just the
beginning of greater interest, even though the amount they bid for was
rather small,' said a ministry official.
Poland sold 2,300bn zlotys of Treasury bills at its weekly auction.

rich pickings

THE CRIPPLED and convalescing companies which litter Canada's business
landscape have offered rich pickings to investors willing to pay less heed
to credit-rating agencies than to their own instincts.
In a local adaptation of the US junk-bond market, a large number of US and,
more recently, Canadian investors have put their money into corporate
securities well below the grade normally favoured by pension funds and other
institutions.
The returns have in many cases been spectacular. Bonds issued by Stelco,
Canada's second-biggest steelmaker, traded as low as 30 cents to the
CDollars late last year when it looked as if the company might go to the
wall. They are now changing hands at close to par.
Participants agree that the best is probably over for the 'distressed'
sector of the market, comprising companies which have filed or come close to
filing for bankruptcy protection. They include bonds issued by buildings
owned by Olympia &amp; York, the crippled property developer, and Royal Trust,
the financial institution in the process of being rescued by Royal Bank of
Canada.
But opportunities still appear to be lurking among another troubled group of
companies, described by one trader as 'below investment-grade'. The
companies seem likely to survive the tough times of the early 1990s, but
their finances have been strained to the point that credit-rating agencies
have cut their ratings below investment-grade level.
One money manager cites the example of 10-year bonds issued by MacMillan
Bloedel, the Vancouver-based forestry group. Rated BBB-high by Dominion Bond
Rating Service of Toronto, the spread between the Macblo bonds and the
equivalent government of Canada bonds has already shrunk from 3 percentage
points to about 1.9 points.
Another portfolio manager points to a series of 10-year first mortgage bonds
secured by leasehold improvements at three Westin hotels in Canada. The
bonds were issued at a spread of 1.25 percentage points in 1988. The spread
is now 6 percentage points.
Other companies in troubled sectors whose bonds have become popular include
Four Seasons Hotels, Domtar and Canadian Pacific Forest Products (both pulp
and paper companies), and Scott's Hospitality (restaurants).
The Canadian high-yield market was spurred by US 'vulture funds' looking for
fresh opportunities, and the reluctance of conservative Canadian
institutions to become involved with securities of dubious credit quality.
'The Canadians didn't understand value in liquidation,' says one market
maker. 'The Americans are accustomed to that sort of thing.'
One sign of US interest is that Goldman Sachs, the New York-based investment
bank, has brought a credit analyst to its Toronto office to seek investment
opportunities among corporate Canada's walking wounded.
Some Canadian portfolio managers, such as Lincludin Management of Oakville,
Ontario, have joined the bandwagon. Local securities dealers, including
Richardson Greenshields and RBC Dominion Securities of Toronto, have also
become more active in trading distressed and below-investment-grade
securities.
Several investment managers say that the market in 'below investment-grade'
securities springs largely from the poor judgments of Canadian rating
agencies. Confidence in local rating groups was especially undermined by
their late recognition of the severity of the problems at property
developer, Olympia &amp; York.
In this respect it is perhaps significant that Standard &amp; Poor's has
recently opened an office in Toronto, and that Moody's is in the process of
following suit.

FT  27 JUL 93 / International Bonds: Relative safety of sterling market
encourages issues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS pressure in the exchange rate mechanism continued to unsettle other
European markets, the sterling bond market provided a focus for activity.
Two straight bonds and two equity-linked financings launched yesterday
benefited from the perception of European investors that the sterling market
is one of the safest choices available.
Anglian Water launched a Pounds 65m issue of bonds with equity warrants,
only the second sterling warrants deal this year. Anglian has a relatively
high dividend yield so it was more economical for the company to issue bonds
with warrants than to launch a convertible bond offering since convertibles
are priced according to dividend yields and warrants are priced according to
the share's volatility, according to lead manager J Henry Schroder Wagg.
About half the proceeds of the issue will be used to refinance the
acquisition of the Nordic Water group of companies in February 1993,
initially financed from surplus core funds, the other half for general
corporate purposes.
The five-year 6 1/2 per cent bonds, issued at 11.5, were bid at 111 at the
end of trading.
Coats Viyella, the UK's largest textiles group, launched a Pounds 75.6m
offering of convertible bonds due 2003, which will be used for general
corporate purposes including the repayment of short-term borrowings.
The deal was priced at the tighter end of indicated levels, with a
conversion premium of 19 per cent and a coupon of 6 1/4 per cent. However,
the deal met strong demand from continental Europe, according to lead
manager Merrill Lynch, and was bid at a  3/4 point premium to its par issue
price.
On the fixed-rate side, both Sweden and Hewlett-Packard, the US computer
company, launched five-year offerings, taking advantage of the swap
opportunities available for bonds maturing at the end of 1998, due to the
shape of the yield curve.
Sweden has been able to set progressively more aggressive funding targets
this year as worries about its weak economy and heavy funding requirements
have subsided. Yesterday's Pounds 250m five-year issue allowed the AA2/AA+
rated sovereign borrower to achieve sub-Libor funding.
The deal was launched at a spread of 36 basis points over the 7 1/4 per cent
gilt due 1998. By the end of the day, the spread was 38 basis points over
the curve, on the bid side.
Hewlett-Packard Finance launched a Pounds 100m five-year offering, priced to
yield 30 basis points over the same reference gilt. Some dealers said the
pricing was on the aggressive side, but lead manager Goldman Sachs pointed
out the borrower's strong rating (AA1 by Moody's and AA+ by Standard &amp;
Poor's) and the paper's rarity value, adding that the deal had met strong
retail demand overseas. The issue was swapped into floating rate US dollars.
Elsewhere, dealers reported renewed talk of a Dollars 150m bond for Morocco
and a smaller issue for Philippine Airlines.
The Bank of England plans to liberalise the rules governing the issuance of
sterling commercial paper and medium-term notes.
On Friday, the Bank issued a consultative document detailing proposed
revisions to existing regulations, and asked market participants for their
comments on the proposals by September 15. The proposed changes involve the
removal of the minimum maturity of seven days for commercial paper and the
maximum maturity of five years for medium-term notes.

The higher earnings stemmed entirely from positive tax adjustments. Before

prices pressure

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NORSK HYDRO, Norway's biggest stock market listed company, yesterday
reported a surge in first-half net income to NKr2.63bn (Dollars 361m) from
NKr903m a year ago, despite difficult market conditions and pressure on
prices in all operating segments.
The sharp improvement was due to a pre-tax gain of NKr2.5bn from the
disposal of Hydro's 38.3 per cent stake in Freia Marabou, Scandinavia's
biggest chocolate maker, which yielded proceeds, plus interest, of NKr3.6bn.
Hydro's performance was also helped by lower production costs, higher crude
oil production and a stronger dollar. Nevertheless, the group's result was
below analysts' average forecast of NKr2.9bn. Second-quarter net income
increased to NKr2.128bn from NKr686m last year.
Group first-half revenue rose by NKr1.487bn to NKr32.262bn and increased in
the second quarter by NKr680m to NKr15.797bn.
First-half operating income improved by NKr511m to NKr2.364bn, while rising
in the second quarter by NKr113m to NKr923m.
'In spite of very adverse market conditions we have been able to improve our
operating figures as a result of reduced costs and the stronger US dollar,'
said Mr Egil Myklebust, president and chief executive.
First-half foreign exchange losses widened to NKr360m from a loss of NKr1m
in the same period last year. The group's financial position strengthened
significantly as a result of the Freia Marabou disposal and the issue of
Dollars 300m and NKr1.1bn debentures.
'The proceeds of these loans and the sale of shares on Freia Marabou will be
used to repay medium-term bank loans,' Hydro said. Group debt was reduced by
NKr4bn to NKr23.2bn at the end of the second quarter from end-1992.

FT  27 JUL 93 / International Company News: China threatens to become Hong
Kong's nemesis - Simon Holberton and Peter John examine growing unease over
the mainland's rapid economic growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON and PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOME brokers and property agents in Hong Kong are wondering if China, the
force behind the vertiginous heights to which Hong Kong's stock and property
markets have risen, will prove the colony's financial nemesis.
Less than a month into the Chinese government's attempt to dampen economic
activity on the mainland it is still too early to say if the Beijing
authorities will succeed. Equally difficult is measuring the impact on Hong
Kong's stock and property markets of such success.
For the past year mainland Chinese investors have been a large source of the
liquidity that has buoyed asset prices in the colony. For that reason it has
not been lost on Hong Kong's financial community that one of the prime
targets of the mainland's current economic policy is speculative stock and
property market investment.
In the past six months companies in Hong Kong, especially mainland-backed
companies, have raised HKDollars 40bn (USDollars 5bn) in new equity,
excluding warrants. Last year, companies raised HKDollars 70bn including
warrants. Much of this money has been raised specifically for China,
underlining Hong Kong's growing importance as a supplier of capital to the
mainland.
However, rapid economic growth in China has brought in its wake resurgent
inflation which the mainland authorities have taken measures to suppress.
This has done two things: made people think twice about the near term growth
prospects for China, and made them ask how much mainland money has been
coming into Hong Kong.
Ms Janice Wallace, head of research at Goldman Sachs, says: 'If these guys
start taking their money home then we will feel it. Liquidity is the real
threat to this market.'
China-related stocks - known as 'red chips' - account for more than 4 per
cent of the value of Hong Kong's Hang Seng index, according to Wardley James
Capel, Hong Kong.
Chinese officials have warned that mainland investment in Hong Kong will
slow. In both Hong Kong and Macao, rumours abound about this project being
deferred or that mainland partner withdrawing from a venture because he has
come under pressure from mainland banks to repay debt.
But the euphoria in Hong Kong surrounding the flotation of nine large and
medium-sized Chinese state-owned companies has waned. Tsingtao Brewery went
well because it was the first of the nine to come to the market, and local
Hong Kong investors knew its product well.
Shanghai Petrochemical, the second and largest entrant, was less successful.
Its sale in Hong Kong suffered from the company being poorly marketed to
investors - the Hong Kong tranche of 850m shares was just 1.7 times
oversubscribed - and from being seen to be too highly priced.
Concerns about the Chinese economy also took the lustre off the issue.
'A lot of interest in China stocks has been concept driven,' says one
analyst. 'They came to the market boasting good backers and good contacts
and with the promise that they would do good deals on the mainland. Now,
with the retrenchment under way, it is difficult to see what they will do.'
Mr Alex Tang, director of research at Dao Heng Securities, agrees. 'On top
of the concern about the economy is concern about the controlling
shareholders of these companies. What will they put into these listings and
will the businesses have good earnings potential? No one knows.'
To date, foreign investors appear content to ride out what is seen as an
essentially short-term correction. Mr Simon Nicholson, senior Far East
investment manager for Gartmore Asset Management, agrees that there are
problems.
'It will be a tricky six months in terms of markets,' he says. 'Hong Kong is
saturated with new issues, rights issues and placements, and the whole worry
about China is that the currency will steadily deteriorate.'
The most enthusiastic investors are, unremarkably, the China funds which
dedicate their cash to mainland concerns, targeting China plays principally
but also unlisted Chinese companies.
There are more than 30 China funds with a total investment potential in
excess of Dollars 2bn. The problem they face, with the total capitalisation
of the Shanghai and Shenzhen B shares hovering below Dollars 1bn, is to find
enough places to put their cash.
Kleinwort Benson's Dollars 60m China fund, which began operating last
autumn, has so far placed only Dollars 16.5m.
However, Mr Robin Fox, the fund's chairman, remains confident. 'You only
have to spend some time there to see how fast the country's growing,' he
says.
The jitters in the equity market have been echoed in property. Mainland
interests own an estimated USDollars 10bn of residential and commercial
property in the colony.
Mr Nicholas Brooke, senior partner of surveyors Brooke, Hillier, Parker,
says: 'We are seeing a reduction in the number of transactions and mainland
interest in the property market. There has definitely been a cooling, but we
have a number of large deals in the pipeline and there is no indication that
the mainland counterpart has been told to pull out.'
One thing that Hong Kong has in its favour is that no one, including the
Chinese central government, knows the extent of mainland investment in the
colony. This is because Hong Kong has become a place where the public duties
of mainland Communist party officials overlap with their private financial
interests. Mainland interests in Hong Kong, if asked, will be understating
their assets in the colony.

<TEXT>
VARD, the Norwegian cruise and ferry group, is expected shortly to spin off
its ferry business, for which it will seek a listing on the Oslo bourse,
writes Karen Fossli.
The move follows the end of negotiations, which have lasted four months,
aimed at selling the ferry business for NKr1.1bn (Dollars 151m) to a group
of foreign investors led by Union Bank of Switzerland.
Under the deal, Vard would have retained a 20 per cent stake in the
operation. It said yesterday it had ended the talks because the terms would
have been unsatisfactory given the earnings prospects of its two ferry
lines, Larvik Line and Scandi Line.
Vard is now looking at ways to convert some of the ferry business's debt to
kroner from dollars and transfering a portion of that debt to the
newly-created unit.

FT  27 JUL 93 / International Company News: Oil group blames tight margins
for slight fall
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
ATLANTIC Richfield (Arco), the Los Angeles-based energy group, reported a
fall in second-quarter net income to Dollars 271m, or Dollars 1.67 a share,
from Dollars 309m, or Dollars 1.91, a year ago. It blamed pressure on
margins in its downstream oil and gas business and chemicals.
The figures include a net credit of Dollars 48m reflecting gains from the
sale of oil and gas properties, compared with a Dollars 65m special credit
in the 1992 quarter.
Refining, marketing and transportation earnings fell from Dollars 162m to
Dollars 129m. Earnings from chemicals dropped to Dollars 9m, from Dollars
24m last time, before the benefit from the Dollars 56m sale of a South
Korean joint venture by Arco Chemical, an 83 per cent-owned subsidiary.
Higher natural gas prices, though, helped push exploration and production
earnings to Dollars 160m before the gain on disposals, from Dollars 143m a
year before.
First-half net income was up year-on-year, from Dollars 489m in 1992 (before
a Dollars 392m for a change in accounting policy) to Dollars 531m.
Unocal, also based in Los Angeles, reported second-quarter net earnings of
Dollars 88m, or 33 cents a share, up from Dollars 66m, or 28 cents a year
before.
Excluding the effect of accounting changes and other special items,
first-half net earnings were up from Dollars 76m to Dollars 186m.

FT  27 JUL 93 / International Company News: American Cyanamid turns in
Dollars 166m loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AMERICAN Cyanamid, the US bioscience group, suffered a pre-tax loss of
Dollars 166m for the second quarter, compared with pre-tax profits for the
same period last year of Dollars 228m.
The loss was the result of an exceptional charge of Dollars 378m for the
acquisition of a 53 per cent stake in Immunex Corporation, the
pharmaceuticals company that specialises in cancer treatments.
The loss per share was Dollars 2.54, compared with earnings of Dollars 1.62
in the second quarter last year.
Sales increased 2 per cent from Dollars 1.48bn to Dollars 1.51bn for the
quarter. This was in spite of the strength of the dollar against European
currencies, which reduced sales by about 2 per cent.
Turnover of the healthcare division, which includes its pharmaceuticals
subsidiary Lederle, fell during the second quarter. Although sales of
vaccines increased, sales of consumer health products fell because of the
strong dollar and lower sales of Prostep, the transdermal patch used to help
stop people smoking.
Worldwide sales of the agricultural group rose during the second quarter
compared with last year, mainly because of increased sales of crop
protection products. Pursuit and Scepter, two herbicides for soyabeans, did
particularly well. American Cyanamid intends to acquire Shell's crop
protection business.

ZENITH Electronics, the sole surviving US manufacturer of television sets,
yesterday unveiled a second-quarter net loss of Dollars 24.7m, or 79 cents a
share, writes Karen Zagor in New York.
A year earlier, the company suffered a net deficit of Dollars 15.2m, or 52
cents, including royalty income of Dollars 13m and a special tax credit of
Dollars 4m. In the 1993 quarter, royalty income was Dollars 5m.
Sales slipped slightly to Dollars 274.7m from Dollars 280m a year earlier.
For the first six months, Zenith recorded a net loss of Dollars 46.5m, or
Dollars 1.51, on sales of Dollars 565.2m, against a deficit of Dollars
43.8m, or Dollars 1.50, on sales of Dollars 545.2m in the same period of
1992.

FT  27 JUL 93 / International Company News: Chevron profits slide to Dollars
50m as charges take toll

PROFITS at Chevron, the US energy group, have been hit by restructuring
charges of Dollars 552m to cover the proposed disposal of two refineries and
200 service stations. The group was left with net income for the second
quarter of Dollars 50m, or 15 cents a share, down from Dollars 315m, or 92
cents, a year ago.
Before net special charges of Dollars 515m, earnings rose to Dollars 565m
from Dollars 354m in the same 1992 period on a comparable basis, on turnover
down from Dollars 10.5bn to Dollars 9.9bn.
Chevron has moved further than most other large US oil and gas groups in
cutting costs to counter the over-capacity in the US refining business.
Mr Ken Derr, chairman, said average costs in the first half were Dollars
6.54 a barrel, 87 cents lower than in 1991 and ahead of the company's target
cost reductions.
Second-quarter operating results were supported by a rise in US exploration
and production earnings, to Dollars 207m from Dollars 121m (or Dollars 146m
before special charges), helped by the higher natural gas prices. Higher
prices have bolstered the profits of all the big US energy groups.
International upstream earnings fell to Dollars 142m from Dollars 157m as a
result of special charges, though they were Dollars 17m up, at Dollars 147m,
before charges.
US refining and marketing returned a loss of Dollars 507m due to the
restructuring charges, though Chevron said sales margins had improved,
especially in the south-east.
International downstream earnings jumped from Dollars 42m to Dollars 107m,
helped by a Dollars 13m contribution from a disposal and by higher margins
and sales.
Earnings from chemical operations were flat at Dollars 6m, before a Dollars
135m gain on the sale of the group's Ortho lawn and garden products
business.
Net income for the first half, at Dollars 551m, was down from Dollars 655m
last time, before the effects of accounting changes. Leaving aside special
charges in both periods, earnings rose from Dollars 607m to Dollars 1.068bn.
Second-quarter net income at Phillips Petroleum rose to Dollars 121m, or 46
cents a share, from Dollars 100m, or 38 cents, a year ago. The advance was
attributed to higher natural gas prices and lower worldwide exploration
expenses.
Earnings were held back by Dollars 16m of charges related to litigation
claims and foreign currency losses, compared with special credits of Dollars
10m in the 1992 quarter.
First-half net income of Dollars 182m (Dollars 194m before special charges)
compared with a loss before accounting changes in the first six months of
1992 of Dollars 5m (a profit of Dollars 61m after leaving aside one-off
charges).
Mr CJ Silas, chairman, warned: 'Natural gas and crude oil prices have
declined recently, and downstream margins continue to be depressed.'

CAMPBELL Soup, the US food group, has warned that its 1993 earnings would
include significant after-tax charges to reflect new accounting standards.
The company, which reports its fiscal year-end results in September, said it
was adopting three new accounting standards.
The cumulative one-time charge against earnings will be between Dollars 247m
and Dollars 260m, or 98 cents to Dollars 1.03 a share. In addition, it will
take its standard annual charge to earnings for employee medical benefits
which will stand at Dollars 18m, or 7 cents, in 1993.
Mr Frank Weise, chief financial officer, said Campbell would have a very
strong balance sheet and credit rating even after the non-cash charges.
In fiscal 1992, the company posted net earnings of Dollars 490.5m on sales
of Dollars 6.26bn.
Campbell's is adopting FAS 106 accounting for post-retirement benefits other
than pensions, FAS 109 accounting for income taxes, replacing FAS 96 and FAS
112 accounting for post-employment benefits.
Philips Electronics has filed a shelf registration with the US Securities
and Exchange Commission for up to Dollars 1.5bn of debt securities.
Net proceeds will be used to repay debt of the Philips Group and for general
corporate purposes.
No underwriters were listed in the filing.

TELEFONOS de Mexico (Telmex), Mexico's telephone monopoly, recorded a strong
12.9 per cent increase in profits in real terms for the second quarter after
a pick-up in long-distance and local telephone traffic.
The group earned second-quarter net profits of 2.089bn pesos (Dollars 674m),
compared to 1.851bn pesos in the second quarter last year. It posted
revenues of 5.973bn pesos, an 8.6 per cent increase in real terms.
'The figures are encouraging. Given weak economic growth, the increase in
national long distance volumes and general increase in revenues was
impressive,' said Mr Neil Perry, head of research at Baring Research in
Mexico City.
Telmex's local call revenues grew by 17.8 per cent, compared with 11.2 per
cent in the first quarter.
National long-distance revenues increased by 4.7 per cent, and international
long-distance revenues were up by 2.8 per cent.
The better-than-expected revenues offset a slight decline in operating
margins, caused by wage increases in April and rises in maintenance costs.
Telmex suffered exchange losses of 110m pesos in the second quarter, more
than double losses in the first quarter, mainly because of continued
weakness of the peso against the yen.
Telmex installed 184,000 lines in the second quarter, bringing total lines
in service to 7.08m, 11.5 per cent more than the second quarter last year.
Its cellular subsidiary nearly doubled its subscribers to 191,304.

FT  27 JUL 93 / International Company News: Latin American TV sheds
parochial image - Television networks in the region have been converging
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN Mr Ricardo Salinas Pliego, the new owner of Mexico's television
networks Seven and 13 was asked how he would compete with Televisa, the
country's large media company, he quickly turned to the subject of help from
foreign partners, such as NBC, Telemundo, Fox, TV Globo of Brazil and Radio
Caracas Television of Venezuela.
A decade ago, Mr Salinas's reply might have seemed odd.
Latin American television companies were parochial affairs, best known for
their soap operas and lengthy coverage of presidential speeches. They bought
plenty of programmes from each other, but each country's market remained
distinct.
However, television in the region has converged. The spur has been new
technology which enables programmers to broadcast cheaply throughout the
region, and the growing marketing clout of Televisa and TV Globo.
It is possible to travel from Chicago to Buenos Aires and watch the same
Spanish-language news; Brazilian, Mexican, or Venezuelan soap opera; or
Cuban-American talk shows.
However, the inter-change of programming is far from complete since
programmes being beamed across borders still face both political and
cultural problems.
During the recent troubles in Guatemala, Televisa's Echo news programme, the
main source of news, was briefly blocked by the government and its offices
fired on by machine guns.
Frank discussions of teenage sex and other sensitive issues by the
Cuban-American talk show host Cristina, while perfectly normal in Miami,
have caused some outrage in Mexico.
Televisa, which has about 90 per cent market share in Mexico, is the main
force behind the regionalisation of programming.
It has bought stakes in leading television stations in Peru, Chile, and the
US (through Univision) and half of PanAmSat, the satellite company in the
Americas.
In addition, it has production agreements in Argentina and Venezuela, and
has formed a joint venture with TCI of the US, the world's largest cable
operator, to promote cable and satellite television in the region.
The alliances enable Televisa to earn about twice as much from selling its
programmes as it makes from offering them in an open market, and keep
potential competitors from selling programmes in its home market in Mexico.
Thus, soon after Televisa bought its stake in Univision, the US network
pulled a successful soap opera from Televisa's rival station in Guadalajara,
Mexico's second-largest city.
Televisa's stakes throughout the region are putting pressure on rivals to
form their own alliances.
Hence, Mr Ricardo Salinas's overtures to practically every Hispanic
competitor of Televisa.
The logic is that unless Channels Seven and 13 have access to the same
variety of programming enjoyed by Televisa, they are unlikely to be able to
compete effect-ively.
Mr Salinas said that initially his two networks would have to buy in a lot
of their programmes. He is unlikely to limit his buying to any single
source, but rather seek links with several companies.
Mr Joaquin Blaya, head of Telemundo, the US Spanish language network, is
particularly keen to be one of those partners, in part to help his company
compete against Univision, which he used to run before Televisa took its 25
per cent stake.
The spread of cable and satellite television in Latin America has encouraged
still more programme-swapping in the region.
Although only about 3m Latin American homes are connected to cable or
satellite, these are the richest consumers, most likely to buy new cars and
consumer durables. As the cost of the technology falls, the market is
expanding rapidly.
Programmers who once would have ignored any one market as too small, can
reach several with one transmission.
With the Hispanic market in the US rising, companies such as Time Warner and
CNN of the US have started to produce their own Spanish-language programmes.
There are more than 20m Hispanics in the US, and in 10 years they are
expected to be the US's largest minority.
Recently, four US film studios and Multivision, Televisa's wireless cable
rival in Mexico, launched a Latin American Spanish-language film channel,
CineCanal while Miami-based International Television has created a cable
channel specifically for Hispanic women.
NBC and CNN are providing their Spanish-language news; and MTV is about to
launch a pan-American Spanish-language version of its music and video
programme.

FT  27 JUL 93 / International Company News: American Cyanamid turns in
Dollars 166m loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AMERICAN Cyanamid, the US bioscience group, suffered a pre-tax loss of
Dollars 166m for the second quarter, compared with pre-tax profits for the
same period last year of Dollars 228m.
The loss was the result of an exceptional charge of Dollars 378m for the
acquisition of a 53 per cent stake in Immunex Corporation, the
pharmaceuticals company that specialises in cancer treatments.
The loss per share was Dollars 2.54, compared with earnings of Dollars 1.62
in the second quarter last year.
Sales increased 2 per cent from Dollars 1.48bn to Dollars 1.51bn for the
quarter. This was in spite of the strength of the dollar against European
currencies, which reduced sales by about 2 per cent.
Turnover of the healthcare division, which includes its pharmaceuticals
subsidiary Lederle, fell during the second quarter. Although sales of
vaccines increased, sales of consumer health products fell because of the
strong dollar and lower sales of Prostep, the transdermal patch used to help
stop people smoking.
Worldwide sales of the agricultural group rose during the second quarter
compared with last year, mainly because of increased sales of crop
protection products. Pursuit and Scepter, two herbicides for soyabeans, did
particularly well. American Cyanamid intends to acquire Shell's crop
protection business.
The chemicals division reported lower turnover, reflecting a programme of
disposals in recent months. Operating income also fell because of the
introduction of new accounting procedures for post-retirement benefits.
Research and development spending increased from Dollars 278.9m for the
first six months last year, to Dollars 301m for the same period in 1993.

piano maker

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LEGENDARY German piano maker C. Bechstein Pianofortefabrik, whose
instruments are used in many of the world's top concert halls, has filed for
bankruptcy, according to its manager, Mr Karl Schulze, Reuter reports from
Berlin.
He confirmed reports that the 140-year-old Berlin company, whose early
customers included composers Franz Liszt, Richard Wagner and Claude Debussy,
faced liquidation because of heavy losses, falling sales and the refusal of
banks to provide new loans.
However, Mr Schulze said he hoped the company, which employs 68 people,
could still be saved by the state government of Berlin.
The Berlin economics ministry said it was considering whether it could help
by providing loan guarantees, taking a stake in Bechstein, or buying
property from it.
Mr Schulze, the main shareholder, would not say how much Bechstein was
losing. However, he told a German newspaper sales had fallen by DM3m to
DM20.8m (Dollars 12m) in 1992 and were expected to reach only DM15m this
year.
Bechstein, which competes with Steinway of the US and Austria's Boesendorfer
at the top end of the piano market, made 350 grand pianos and 600 upright
pianos last year.
Mr Schulze said that, with total worldwide sales of pianos plummeting to
around 600,000 a year from 1m in 1990, Bechstein had abandoned plans to
increase production this year.
The company was established in 1853 by Carl Friedrich Wilhelm Bechstein.
It quickly established a worldwide reputation and, by 1910, made nearly
5,000 instruments a year and employed 1,100 people.
The company remained in the hands of the Bechstein family until the 1960s,
when it sold shares to the Baldwin Piano and Organ Company of the US.
Baldwin became owner in 1973 but sold the company in a management buy-out in
1986.

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CREDIT Lyonnais, the French bank which owns Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, has brought
in a new chairman and strengthened finances at the Hollywood film studio in
preparation for MGM's eventual sale.
The new chairman and chief executive is Mr Frank Mancuso, former chairman of
Paramount Pictures. He takes the place of Mr Alan Ladd Jr, who was ousted on
Sunday after more than two years running MGM.
Mr Mancuso, 60, is a heavyweight member of the Hollywood establishment who
spent 30 years at Paramount but quit in acrimonious circumstances in 1991
when a new president was given effective control over the studio.
Credit Lyonnais took control of MGM in 1992 after foreclosing on loans it
made to Mr Giancarlo Parretti, an Italian entrepreneur, who bought the
company in 1990 for Dollars 1.3bn.
It has also announced three steps to improve the studio's finances and
support an expanded programme of film and television production.
MGM Holdings Inc, the holding company that the bank set up to own MGM, will
assume some Dollars 800m of the studio's Dollars 1.1bn of bank debt.
The studio will cut its interest expenses by redeeming Dollars 221m of
debentures held by MGM Holdings, and will fund this substantially by selling
its cinema assets to the holding company. The cinema chain is one of the
largest in Europe, with more than 400 outlets.
The bank is also increasing the studio's credit line to Dollars 400m from
Dollars 190m.
Mr Francois Gille, director general of Credit Lyonnais, said the financial
moves would give MGM a debt-to-equity ratio of about 1:2 and the flexibility
to 'pursue a full business agenda'. This includes revival of the film
company, United Artists, to give MGM two production arms.
The deal was largely put together by Mr Michael Ovitz, head of Hollywood's
powerful Creative Artists Agency.
US law forbids banks to hold equity stakes in companies except in
exceptional circumstances, and Credit Lyonnais has until 1997 to dispose of
the studio.

EARNINGS at American Express, the US travel and financial services group,
rose sharply in the second quarter. The group was lifted by a cut of
one-third in its provisions for credit losses and strong revenues generated
by its Lehman Brothers securities arm.
Post-tax profits rose 34.1 per cent to Dollars 416m, or 83 cents a share, up
from Dollars 310m, or 63 cents a year ago. For the first-half, net income
rose to Dollars 659m from Dollars 584m.
Travel-related services saw a rise in net income to Dollars 234m, from
Dollars 124m, as provisions for losses and claims fell to Dollars 394m, from
Dollars 600m. The company said this decline, which was attributable mainly
to its lending rather than its charge card operations, was due to improved
credit management and portfolio restructuring.
Revenues from travel-related services fell, due to discount rate reductions
and a fall in the number of cards in use, though this was partially offset
by an increase in the volume of business billed to each cardholder. At the
end of the second quarter there were 34m cards in issue down, from 35.6m a
year ago. Business billed to these cards amounted to Dollars 31m during the
quarter, up from Dollars 29m, with a rise in US business offsetting a slight
decline elsewhere.
Lehman Brothers, which American Express will continue to own after the
expected completion of the sale this weekend of the Shearson retail broking
business, returned after-tax earnings of Dollars 95m, after a loss of
Dollars 24m in the same period in 1992. Commission and market-making income
were up, while investment banking revenues fell to Dollars 208m from Dollars
245m. Shearson made net profits of Dollars Dollars 26.5m in the quarter,
down from Dollars 28m a year before.
Earnings rose in the group's IDS Financial Services division, where net
income climbed to Dollars 90m from Dollars 73m while American Express Bank
rose Dollars 1m to Dollars 20m.

FT  27 JUL 93 / International Company News: Inco offsets slump in nickel
price

<TEXT>
LOSSES at Inco, the nickel producer, were virtually unchanged in the second
quarter. A further slump in nickel prices was offset by improved results
from the company's alloys business, lower interest charges and favourable
currency movements.
The Toronto-based company suffered a loss of Dollars 2.2m, or 3 cents a
share, in the latest period, compared with a Dollars 1.5m loss, also 3 cents
a share, a year earlier. Revenues slipped to Dollars 608m from Dollars 681m.
Operating earnings of the primary metals division dropped to Dollars 31m
from Dollars 46m. The price of nickel realised during the quarter fell by 16
per cent to Dollars 2.93 a lb, while copper, cobalt and rhodium prices were
also lower.
However, unit production costs for nickel were 9 per cent lower in the
second quarter, reflecting reduced employment costs and the weaker Canadian
dollar.
The alloys and engineered products division, which is restructuring, turned
a Dollars 5m loss last year into an operating profit of Dollars 4m, due to
lower operating costs and higher alloy shipments.
Third-quarter earnings will be boosted by Inco's recent sale of its 62 per
cent stake in TVX Gold, a gold producer, which brought an after-tax gain of
about Dollars 125m, or Dollars 1.14 a share.

FT  27 JUL 93 / International Company News: Novell warns of unchanged
earnings
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
NOVELL, the computer software company, yesterday announced that
third-quarter European sales were weaker than it had anticipated. It now
expected its earnings per share for the period to be flat relative to 1992.
The announcement came after the close of the New York Stock Exchange, where
Novell's shares had already fallen sharply yesterday as analysts anticipated
weaker-than-expected results. Novell closed at Dollars 21 1/4 , down Dollars
3 1/2 .
Analysts had previously expected earnings per share of around 27 cents, but
some cut these forecasts to around 23 cents yesterday. In the third quarter
of last year the company made 21 cents.
Novell, which is based in Utah and specialises in software to link computers
in local area networks, recently acquired Unix System Laboratories from
American Telephone &amp; Telegraph.
It said yesterday that because of the European weakness it now expected
total third-quarter revenue, including about Dollars 8m from Unix System
Laboratories, to be roughly flat with its second quarter. Net income per
share, exclusive of charges due to acquisitions, was now expected to decline
modestly from the previous quarter.
Revenues were expected to be up 15 per cent compared with the same quarter
of 1992. The company expects to announce its third-quarter figures during
the week of August 23.

ZENITH Electronics, the sole surviving US manufacturer of television sets,
yesterday unveiled a second-quarter net loss of Dollars 24.7m, or 79 cents a
share.
A year earlier, the company suffered a net deficit of Dollars 15.2m, or 52
cents, including royalty income of Dollars 13m and a special tax credit of
Dollars 4m. In the 1993 quarter, royalty income was Dollars 5m.
Sales slipped slightly to Dollars 274.7m from Dollars 280m a year earlier.
Increased shipments of colour televisions in the latest quarter were offset
by declining shipments of other electronics products.
Although the company said it was still feeling the impact of industry price
cuts for colour televisions last year, it benefited from higher sales volume
and corporate cost reductions.
Zenith also said colour television prices had remained relatively stable
this year.
The company said its operating loss, stripping out royalty income, narrowed
to Dollars 26m in the 1993 quarter from Dollars 29m the previous year.
For the fist six months, Zenith recorded a net loss of Dollars 46.5m, or
Dollars 1.51, on sales of Dollars 565.2m, against a deficit of Dollars
43.8m, or Dollars 1.50, on sales of Dollars 545.2m in the same period of
1992.

<TEXT>
TEXACO of the US is selling a large part of its stake in a Rotterdam crude
oil terminal to Saudi-controlled Aramco Overseas, giving the Saudis their
first foothold in European storage facilities, AP-DJ reports from Amsterdam.
Texaco Raffinerderij Pernis said it would reduce its stake in the
Rotterdam-based Texaco/Esso Maatschap Crude Oil Terminal, a joint venture
formed in 1962 by Esso Nederland and Caltex Petroleum Maatschappij
Nederland.
Aramco Overseas, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Saudi Arabian Oil Company,
will acquire a 34.35 per cent stake in the storage facilities, marking the
group's move toward a more permanent presence in Europe. Previously, the
company had used only of leased storage capacity.
Through the deal, Aramco would add an additional 6m barrels of storage
capacity in the area to the 5m barrels the company leases from Paktank in
Rotterdam.
The sale would leave Esso with a 42.85 per cent share, and Texaco with a
22.8 per cent stake, Texaco said.
A new company will be formed to operate the terminal, which receives, stores
and pumps crude oil for the Esso refineries in Rotterdam and Antwerp. The
storage facilities can hold up to 17m barrels of crude oil.
Texaco said the proposed sale was meant to bring TRP's storage facilities
into line with operating requirements. Those requirements have been reduced
since 1989, the company said, when Texaco formed its Netherlands Refining
Company joint venture with the British Petroleum.
This venture links two refinery sites, at Pernis and Europoort.

UPJOHN of the US has formed a joint venture to manufacture pharmaceuticals
in southern China, AP-DJ resports from Beijing.
Mr Ley Smith, the company's president, said the company would invest an
initial Dollars 30m to build a plant in the city of Suzhou, 90km west of
Shanghai.
Production of antibiotics, steroids and healthcare products is scheduled to
begin in 1996.
The Michigan-based company will own 75 per cent of the joint venture, while
the Chinese partner, Suzhou Pharmaceutical Factory No 4, will own 25 per
cent. The factory will have a western general manager and 200 Chinese
employees.
Mr Smith said that, initially, almost the entire production of the plant in
Suzhou would be used for the Chinese market. 'As the business grows it's
quite possible that some of the products may be exported,' he said.
This is Upjohn's first important project in China, and others are planned.

deal

<TEXT>
SPACE Systems/Loral, the Californian joint venture between Loral of the US
and four European aerospace companies, has won its biggest contract for more
than a year, worth Dollars 400m, to build two direct broadcasting
satellites.
The deal is the first for the company in direct broadcasting satellites.
It marks a breakthrough for Loral and its European partners, Aerospatiale of
France, Deutsche Aerospace, and Italy's Alenia, in their efforts to
challenge Hughes Aircraft and GE, the US companies which dominate the
satellite construction business,
The buyer of the two satellites is Tempo, a subsidiary of
Tele-Communications (TCI), the Colorado-based company that is the world's
largest cable television operator.
The contract includes risk management and the launching of the satellites.
The satellites will be delivered in orbit in June and October 1996 and will
serve television viewers in the US.
Their arrival in service will increase competition in the still young US
direct broadcasting market, which is less developed than Europe's.
The first direct broadcasting services in the US are scheduled to start next
year with a Hughes satellite.
Space Systems/Loral is 32.7 per cent-owned by Loral, 21.3 per cent by Lehman
Brothers, the New York securities house, and 12.25 per cent by each of the
European partners.

FT  27 JUL 93 / International Company News: Improvement at Cummins
disappoints Wall Street
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN ZAGOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CUMMINS Engine, the world's largest independent manufacturer of diesel
engines, yesterday disappointed Wall Street with its second-quarter results
and the outlook for the third quarter. This was in spite of a substantial
improvement in earnings.
For the three months to July 4, the company earned Dollars 48.2m, or Dollars
2.65 a primary share, compared with profits of Dollars 18.8m, or Dollars 1,
a year earlier. Sales grew to Dollars 1.09bn from Dollars 948.1m.
Cummins is benefiting from improving markets as the US claws its way out of
recession. It said second-quarter sales were higher than in the first
quarter in most of its important markets, including engines for North
American heavy-duty and medium-duty trucks and for industrial equipment.
On the other hand, sales of engines for light commercial vehicles fell in
the quarter, and the company was also hurt by weakness in several
international markets, especially Mexico.
Cummins said it expected third-quarter earnings and sales to trail earnings
and sales in the first two quarters of 1993.
Sales to Chrysler are expected to fall sharply in the third quarter due to
the changeover to the new T300 Series Dodge Ram.
Sales to some international markets are expected to remain weak, and
third-quarter results are seasonally-affected by holiday shutdowns by
Cummins and its biggest customers.
The outlook disappointed investors, who have been bullish about the company
since April, when Cummins unveiled a strong improvement in earnings and
forecast even better second-quarter profits.
On Wall Street, shares in Cummins tumbled Dollars 4 to Dollars 85 at
mid-session. Most analysts had expected earnings of Dollars 2.68 a share in
the latest quarter.
For the first half of 1993, the group earned Dollars 89.3m, or Dollars 4.87,
compared with a deficit of Dollars 227.3m, or Dollars 14.69.
Stripping out the impact of a Dollars 251.1m charge for accounting changes
in the first six months of 1992, Cummins earned Dollars 23.8m, or Dollars
1.25 last year. Sales advanced to Dollars 2.14bn from Dollars 1.83bn.

<TEXT>
STONE Container, the US paper and packaging group, yesterday reported a
deeper second-quarter loss, saying it continued to be hurt by poor pricing
conditions for most of its products, Reuter reports.
It said that, except for recent improvements in newsprint prices, it was
unable to raise prices for other products. Prices of most of its other
products declined in the first half of 1993, the company said.
The second-quarter net loss was Dollars 71.6m, or Dollars 1.03 a share,
compared with a net loss of Dollars 40.7m, or 60 cents, a year earlier.
Revenues were Dollars 1.27bn, down from Dollars 1.37bn last time.
'Even though linerboard has been under discounting pressure recently, we
believe that conditions are favourable for price recovery beginning as early
as this fall and perhaps lasting for a period of years,' Mr Roger Stone,
chairman, president and chief executive officer, said.
'Clearly, since the majority of our revenues are derived from this product
line, we are looking forward to this favourable development,' he added.
The company said it planned to shut down temporarily six of its mills in the
US and Canada.
The mills are scheduled to resume production during the third quarter, it
added.

   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LOSSES at Inco, the international nickel producer, were virtually unchanged
in the second quarter. A further slump in nickel prices was offset by
improved results from the company's alloys business, lower interest charges
and favourable currency movements.
The Toronto-based company suffered a loss of Dollars 2.2m, or 3 cents a
share, in the latest period, compared with a Dollars 1.5m loss, also 3 cents
a share, a year earlier. Revenues slipped to Dollars 608m from Dollars 681m,
due largely to a 12 per cent fall in primary metal sales. Interest charges
edged down to Dollars 25.2m from Dollars 27.5m and tax payments were also
slightly lower.
Operating earnings of the primary metals division dropped to Dollars 31m
from Dollars 46m. The price of nickel realised during the quarter fell by 16
per cent to Dollars 2.93 per pound, while copper, cobalt and rhodium prices
were also lower.
However, unit production costs for nickel were 9 per cent lower in the
second quarter. Inco does not disclose precise cost levels. The company said
the drop reflected reduced employment costs and the weaker Canadian dollar.
The alloys and engineered products division, which is in the middle of a
restructuring, turned a Dollars 5m loss last year into an operating profit
of Dollars 4m. The improvement was ascribed to lower operating costs and
higher alloy shipments.
Finished nickel inventories rose to 71m lb on June 30 from 67m lb three
months earlier. However, the company said stocks were likely to drop during
the current quarter as a result of summer shutdowns at its Ontario and
Manitoba operations.
Third-quarter earnings will be boosted by Inco's recent sale of its 62 per
cent stake in TVX Gold, a gold producer. The sale has brought an after-tax
gain of about Dollars 125m, or Dollars 1.14 a share, which will be used to
reduce debt and for 'general corporate purposes'.
Long-term debt totalled Dollars 972m on June 30, down from Dollars 1.08bn a
year earlier.

Victoire
</HEADLINE>

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SUEZ, one of France's largest industrial and financial holding companies,
last night made a bid for full control of Victoire, the French insurance
group in which Suez already holds a majority stake.
Suez owns 63.21 per cent of Victoire, after having exchanged its own shares
for a stake in Victoire owned by Japan's Dai-Ichi Mutual Life Insurance
Company.
Together with the insurance group Union des Assurances de Paris (UAP), with
which it is acting in concert, Suez holds 98.05 per cent of Victoire voting
rights.
Suez is offering FFr1,480 per share. Victoire shares were suspended
yesterday, having closed at FFr1,408 on Friday.
The bid marks another stage in the feud between Suez and UAP - which is one
of its larger shareholders and also a minority investor in Victoire - over
control of Colonia, the German insurer controlled by Victoire.
UAP, a candidate for privatisation, has for years been pressuring Suez to
cede control of Colonia in return for its shares in Victoire. However, Suez
recently broke off negotiations.
Suez acquired Victoire in 1989 but helped to pay for the deal by selling a
stake to UAP. Victoire made net profits of FFr214m (Dollars 39.6m) in 1992,
down from FFr1.8bn in 1991.
Suez last year fell in to the red for the first time in its 135-year
history, with a net loss of FFr1.87bn.
The Victoire offer comes at a time when Suez is struggling to regain the
stock market's confidence and when UAP, which reported net profits down to
FFr1.08bn in 1992 from FFr3.77bn in 1991, is anxious to defuse its row with
Suez in the approach to privatisation.

deadlock

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR MAURIZIO Gucci, chairman and joint shareholder of Italy's Gucci luxury
goods group, yesterday offered to sell his 50 per cent stake or buy out the
Investcorp banking group, the joint owner, in an attempt to break the
deadlock facing the company.
'Let's put our bids in two sealed envelopes. Whoever offers the larger
amount can have the other partner's shares', he suggested.
Last week, Investcorp initiated legal proceedings in the US in an effort to
raise the pressure on Mr Gucci, whom it accuses of mismanaging the company.
The Bahrain-based bank also won a temporary freeze on Mr Gucci's shares.
Mr Gucci, who announced unspecified legal actions against Investcorp in
Italian and other courts, accused Investcorp of deliberately damaging the
company in an attempt to force him to sell his holding.
He said that relations between the two partners, which share control of the
group founded by his grandfather 70 years ago, had virtually broken down
over the past seven months.
Mr Gucci declined to speculate on why Investcorp had blocked decision-making
at the group, which is facing serious difficulties. Mr Gucci said Investcorp
had gone so far as to obstruct attempts to secure repayment of L104bn
(Dollars 64.8m) due to Gucci's Italian holding company from its US
subsidiary. As a result, the holding company's balance sheet had
deteriorated from being L19.1bn in credit with banks to a L85bn deficit at
the end of last April.
A spokesman for the bank refused to comment on what he called Mr Gucci's
'inaccurate statement'. The issue would now be decided by the courts in the
US, he said. 'The facts will speak for themselves and the case will be
decided on its merits.'
Mr Gucci denied that he had been forced to pledge his shares to obtain bank
loans. According to Investcorp, such actions would have invalidated the
shareholders' agreement between the two parties. It gives either side the
right of first refusal in the event that the shares change hands.

FT  27 JUL 93 / International Company News: Moulinex hit by European
slowdown
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
MOULINEX, one of France's largest manufacturers of kitchen appliances,
stayed in the red during the first quarter of this year with a pro forma net
loss of FFr16m (Dollars 2.7m), against FFr90m in the same period of last
year.
The group, burdened by heavy debts since the takeover two years ago of
Krups, its German competitor, has been badly affected by the slowdown in the
European electrical appliances market.
The first-quarter loss follows the announcement earlier this year that
Moulinex fell into a net loss of FFr115m in 1992 from net profits of FFr171m
in 1991. Turnover rose by 4 per cent in the first quarter, but fell by 10
per cent to FFr1.83bn in the second quarter, producing a fall in sales of
nearly 4 per cent to FFr3.69bn for the first half of 1993.

MOULINEX, one of France's largest manufacturers of kitchen appliances,
stayed in the red during the first quarter of this year with a pro forma net
loss of FFr16m (Dollars 2.7m), against FFr90m in the same period of last
year.
The group, which has been burdened by heavy debts since the takeover two
years ago of Krups, its German competitor, has been badly affected by the
slowdown in the European electrical appliances market, where it faces fierce
competition from the multinational electronics groups.
The first-quarter loss, which follows the announcement earlier this year
that Moulinex fell into a net loss of FFr115m in 1992 from net profits of
FFr171m in 1991, reflects both competitive market conditions and the impact
on exports of the French franc's strength since the September currency
crisis.
Turnover rose by 4 per cent in the first quarter, but fell by 10 per cent to
FFr1.83bn in the second quarter, producing a fall in sales of nearly 4 per
cent to FFr3.69bn for the first half of 1993.
The deterioration in Moulinex's performance was mainly due to the economic
instability, and adverse exchange rates in Italy, Spain and the UK, which
account for one-fifth of total sales.
However, Moulinex fared well in other markets. The group, which has changed
its year-end from December 31 to March 31, managed to increase sales in
France, Germany, the US (for the Krups brand) and eastern Europe.
Credit Agricole and Banque Sofinco, a subsidiary of Suez, have agreed to
collaborate in the area of consumer credit, Reuter reports from Paris.

FT  27 JUL 93 / International Company News: BMW sales slide 9% to DM14.7bn
in first half
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SALES AT BMW, the German luxury car manufacturer, fell 9 per cent to
DM14.7bn (Dollars 8.5bn) in the first half of this year, and profits
suffered from the 'known leverage effects' of such a decline, according to
Mr Bernd Pischetsrieder, group chairman.
Even so, the group had to reduce production by only 10 per cent to 275,000
units, while the German motor industry overall had cut output by a quarter,
he said.
At the same time, BMWs were the most sought-after cars in their class in
western Europe, he said, and the group had managed to adapt output without
short-time working, which has been widespread in other companies.
Earnings figures, and more details of Mr Pischetsrieder's plans, are
expected to be announced tomorrow. In the first half of last year, the group
earned a net DM421m on sales of DM16.2bn.
Analysts expect full-year profits of around DM500m, compared with DM726m in
1992.
Mr Pischetsrieder, who took charge of the group in May, indicated that he
wanted to build world market share - currently 1.7 per cent - and further
improve efficiency so 'we can earn money with sales of 500,000'. Last year,
the group delivered 595,000 cars to distributors.
At present the group has capacity to build 560,000 cars a year in Germany.
The planned opening of a new works - its first outside Germany - in South
Carolina in 1995 will increase the total by 70,000, or 13 per cent.
Mr Pischetsrieder also suggested that BMW might attempt to build its
international position by making cars smaller than its current entry-level
models, the 3-Series.
For the present its most important projects were the US works and building
sales in south-east Asia and China.
Volume sales rose 23 per cent in the US in 1992, contributing 11 per cent of
turnover.

FT  27 JUL 93 / International Company News: VW and Suzuki abandon plan to
develop small car
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
VOLKSWAGEN and Suzuki have abandoned a planned joint venture to develop and
manufacture a mini-car for the European market.
The German company said both sides had agreed the project was no longer
feasible because of recession.
The Japanese group said it had accepted a VW proposal to stop now, but added
that it would continue to develop a car on the basis of results achieved so
far.
The two companies had settled on the final design and were discussing
cost-sharing when the axe fell, Suzuki said.
The plan called for up to 150,000 vehicles a year to be built at the
Barcelona factory of Seat, VW's Spanish sub-sidiary.
The cancellation is a further indication of VW's rigorous efforts to reduce
costs and return to profit. It follows the company's withdrawal last year
from a similar deal with SMH, the Swiss watchmaker, to develop a
high-fashion 'Swatch car'.
Both projects were part of a strategy, developed under the leadership of Mr
Carl Hahn, the VW chairman who handed over to Mr Ferdinand Piech last
January, to give Volkswagen a leading position in the small car market.
At present, VW's smallest vehicle is the Seat Marbella. Growth in demand for
even smaller cars is expected to outstrip that for most other classes in the
latter half of this decade and beyond.
Meanwhile, VW continues to develop its own Chico model to meet demand for
cheap models better suited to crowded urban traffic conditions in western
Europe and the spending power of people in the former communist bloc.
At the same time, the German carmaker is continuing development of a
super-lean, low-cost manufacturing process introduced by Mr Jose Ignacio
Lopez de Arriortua, appointed production director after he joined the group
in March from General Motors.
Suzuki, in which GM has a small equity stake, had hoped to reap cost-sharing
benefits from the deal and to gain a fresh manufacturing foothold in
continental Europe.
Although most of the Barcelona factory's output was planned to be sold under
the Seat marque, some cars were to be marketed under the Suzuki name,
unaffected by quota restrictions on 'Japanese' vehicles.
Suzuki makes around 35,000 four-wheel drive vehicles a year at its Santana
works in Spain and started manufacturing small cars in Hungary last year.
Output at the Hungarian works, estimated at 15,000 units in the year to the
end of October, is planned to increase to 50,000 in the medium-term.
Most of the Japanese group's expansion efforts are focused on the developing
Asian market.

FT  27 JUL 93 / International Company News: Fog clears from Montedison loss
 -The allegations surrounding the group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHAREHOLDERS crowding into the glass-topped ground-floor assembly hall of
Montedison's Milan headquarters last month were shocked to discover their
group, already rocked by revelations of higher-than-expected borrowings, had
lost L435bn (Dollars 271m) more than previously revealed.
No adequate reasons for the higher loss, revised upwards to L1,679bn from
L1,244bn, were given. The only comment from Mr Carlo Sama, then Montedison's
managing director, was that the additional figure stemmed from a credit by
Financing and Investments, a hitherto-unknown Curacao-based subsidiary,
which had proved to be 'irrecoverable'.
In the four weeks since then, Mr Sama has landed in jail, accused, like
three others arrested over the weekend, of falsifying company accounts and
illegal political funding. Meanwhile, Mr Gabriele Cagliari, the former
chairman of the state-owned Eni energy and chemicals group, and Mr Raul
Gardini, the former head of the quoted Ferruzzi Finanziaria (Ferfin) holding
company, which controls Montedison, have committed suicide.
The link is Mr Giuseppe Garofano, the former senior Ferruzzi and Montedison
executive who returned from hiding earlier this month to give himself up to
Milan magistrates investigating political corruption.
Mr Garofano has sketched a diagram of both political and corporate
corruption, which in the case of the ill-fated Enimont joint venture between
Eni and Montedison, clearly overlapped.
His testimony, widely leaked and believed to be reliable, may have
influenced Mr Cagliari's decision and almost certainly affected that of Mr
Gardini, who would have been arrested along with Mr Sama and the others had
he not apparently commited suicide.
According to Mr Garofano, much of Montedison's extra L435bn loss stemmed
from financial transactions designed to cover up heavy commodity trading
losses incurred by the Ferruzzi group in 1989.
That was when Ferruzzi, then run by Mr Gardini, was forced by the Chicago
Board of Trade, the world's leading futures exchange, to unwind huge
positions in 1989. The US Commodity Futures Trading Commission demanded the
operation as they claimed Ferruzzi had been trying to corner the market in
soyabean futures. If successful, it could have forced other traders into
making highly expensive purchases of soyabeans, whose price was already
rising as a result on the cash market.
The clash with the CBOT left Ferruzzi nursing a Dollars 2m fine and a
Dollars 150m trading loss incurred from unwinding positions. The impact was
reflected in Ferfin's 1990 accounts.
However, Mr Garofano's testimony suggests the actual loss was actually about
Dollars 350m to Dollars 450m. To hide its true size, Mr Gardini allegedly
authorised a financial window-dressing by which the non-declared losses were
shifted off Ferfin's balance sheet and parked with obscure, non-consolidated
Montedison subsidiaries. The losses were masked by 'back-to-back' financial
transactions with so far unnamed banks, which lent money to cover the gap in
the accounts.
The reason the loss suddenly appeared last month was because of Ferfin's
mounting financial difficulties. In late May, the company and the
controlling Ferruzzi family called in five big Italian banks to restructure
the affairs of the group, now facing borrowings of about L31,000bn. One of
the first moves by the banks, perhaps aided by tip-offs, was to pick through
the group's accounts, leading to the discovery of the irregularities in
Montedison's balance sheet.
The Chicago debacle is only one, though perhaps the biggest - of a number of
irregularities disclosed by Mr Garofano. His leaked testimony suggests the
Enimont joint venture was a source of huge kickbacks to Italy's political
parties.
Magistrates unpeeling Italy's political corruption scandal over the past 17
months have increasingly suspected that Enimont lay close to the core. The
doubts have focused on the circumstances surrounding the creation of the
group, owned 40 per cent each by Montedison and Eni, with the remainder
floating, and its termination in November 1990.
Mr Garofano's allegations, published yesterday in a weekly news magazine
after an extract was released last Thursday evening, focus on the creation
of a L80bn to L100bn pool of off-balance sheet funds, created through
undeclared capital gains on certain property transactions. These were
allegedly used to finance donations to political parties via Eni as part of
the deal by which Montedison sold its stake in Enimont to its public-sector
partner.
The allegations also suggest members of the Ferruzzi family may have been
cavalier in distinguishing between moneys attributable to Serafino Ferruzzi,
the ultimate family holding company, which owns about 48 per cent of Ferfin,
and the accounts of the public companies.
Though the sums involved are much smaller than those linked to the kickback
allegations over Enimont, the allegations recall similar claims about other
corporate collapses, such as the Maxwell group or Polly Peck in the UK,
where a quoted group was dominated by a single family shareholder.

DEUTSCHE Bank, the agricultural ministry of Saxony and Sudmilch of Stuttgart
will try to arrange a rescue package for Sachsenmilch, the one eastern
German company listed on the Frankfurt stock exchange.
Sachsenmilch, a Saxon-based dairy, is part of the Sudmilch group. Deutsche
Bank, which helped it go public in 1991, had the shares suspended after
disclosures of over-spending.
Deutsche Bank, the company's principal creditor, says it was not told about
cost overruns by Sachsenmilch's former management.
'The facts were withheld from us. . . . .If we had known, we would have had
thought twice about going public,' the bank said.
The shares, floated at DM80, were suspended at DM60.

SHANDWICK, the public relations agency, reported a 12.5 per cent advance in
pre-tax profits - from Pounds 1.54m to Pounds 1.73m - in the six months to
April 30. Turnover grew by Pounds 1.1m to Pounds 80.2m.
The advance in profits arose exclusively from favourable movement in
currency rates, the company said.
Operating profits were up 11.2 per cent, from Pounds 4.35m to Pounds 4.82m,
representing a margin of 9.7 per cent (9.2 per cent).
The accounts have been prepared on an FRS 3 basis and the prior year figures
incorporate costs previously reported as exceptional items.
Interest charges increased to Pounds 3.09m (Pounds 2.81m). Net debt was
Pounds 65.2m, a rise of Pounds 3.1m during the six months. Because of
over-provision for foreign taxes there is no tax charge this time. Earnings
per share came out at 1.7p (0.9p).

FT  27 JUL 93 / UK Company News: The ground rules of a shifting demand -
Expansion at Triplex Lloyd and Wagon Industrial
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNEVEN market conditions have dented the profits of both Triplex Lloyd and
Wagon Industrial, distorting the shape of their respective businesses but
not diminishing their appetite for expansion.
The pressures which the two medium-sized Midlands engineering groups have
faced and their response to them bring into relief both difficulties and
strengths in the sector as continental European markets slow down and the
domestic economy remains sluggish.
Both, like many others in the sector since the early 1980s, have learned to
see their future in an international context. Both are diversified. They
have, in common, the production of automotive components and precision
products. Individually, Wagon is strong on materials handling; Triplex Lloyd
on equipment for the power generation industry.
If not stock market favourites, the two have been consistently
well-regarded. Albert E Sharp, the Birmingham-based broker, has long held a
hold sign over Wagon and a buy sign over Triplex Lloyd.
However, the share price of Wagon, which during the worst of the domestic
recession had been sustained by its international approach, has now found
that this counts against it. The stock market likes to know that its
recovery stocks will continue to recover.
Despite the announcement of a 42 per cent profits increase to Pounds 18.1m
pre-tax for 1992-93, Wagon shares last month tumbled to the bottom half of
their range after the group reminded the market of what the market knew
already. It acknowledged continued difficulties at Forkhardt, the German
subsidiary making specialist power chucks, and indicated that 1993-94 would
be a flat year.
On the other hand, Triplex Lloyd's share price has remained in the middle of
its range although earlier this month it announced static 1992-93 pre-tax
profits at Pounds 7.1m and a projection which indicated strong growth, not
this year, but next.
As an indication of how demands on the ground are shifting, the two sets of
figures were revealing. The UK markets helped Wagon in its sectors, but
those of France and Germany started to slide. The UK pushed Triplex Lloyd
down on building products, but continental Europe supported profits -
especially because the demand for gas turbine power equipment has so far
proved recession-proof.
Present nervousness about Wagon apart, the share prices of both companies
have benefited from the perception, apparent in the market from last autumn,
that engineering companies would respond rapidly to any growth in the UK
economy. Furthermore, both companies have been able to feed the
institutional demand for new paper with rights issues - Wagon last October
and Triplex Lloyd last February.
Although they have been consistently expansionist, both have gone about
expansion in different financial fashions. With interest rates so low the
differences could disappear.
Wagon went through the recession holding net cash of about Pounds 14m and
used its Pounds 32.3m rights issue proceeds for a specific acquisition.
Gearing at Triplex Lloyd increased to 45 per cent in 1991-92 and hit 60 per
cent just before the rights issue reduced it to 23 per cent.
Wagon is now likely to relax a little. Noting that the return on money is 6
or 7 per cent and that the return on industrial assets is about 20 per cent,
Mr John Hudson, chief executive, said: 'As things stand now the UK is
recovering - it's weak but it's sustainable. The case for having a strong
balance sheet is diminished.'
This points to further acquisitions - Wagon made eight in the year to last
March. 'The next steps will be in the UK,' he predicted. This is because of
the tax implications should too rapid expansion take place in Europe. But
this does not imply diversification.
Although Triplex Lloyd has also been acquisitive, its main attention has
latterly been on technical investment and on plant expansion - particularly
in casting operations to satisfy demand in the power industry for turbine
blades and in the automotive sector.
Growth is becoming a matter of survival and management in both groups has
been refined and focused. 'Senior management is much more hands-on with the
larger operations,' said Mr John Foley, managing director, who, with Mr
Colin Cooke, chairman, has concentrated Triplex Lloyd into three divisions.
'Our customers in both the automotive and power sectors are much bigger than
we are and they are looking to deal with a smaller amount of customers,'
said Mr Foley. In other words, Triplex Lloyd does not want to be a minnow
cast aside.
The approach at Wagon is not dissimilar. 'If we're going to hit the earnings
we achieved in the late 1980s, we're not going to do it by waiting for
volume to come back,' said Mr Hudson.
So the way forward is by winning a larger market share, improving
productivity and reducing costs.

Profits of Motor World Group, the car parts and accessories retailer floated
on the stock market in February, rose from Pounds 956,000 to Pounds 1.46m
pre-tax for the half year ended May 2.
Sales rose 13 per cent to Pounds 18.7m in spite of a 'difficult economic
climate'.
On a pro-forma basis profits before tax rose by 12 per cent to Pounds 1.67m
(Pounds 1.49m).
Reduced interest charges of Pounds 263,000 (Pounds 608,000) reflected the
flotation proceeds. Directors said full benefit of lower borrowings would
become more apparent in the second half through lower interest costs.
Earnings were 12p (22.2p), or 8.1p (7.3p) pro-forma. The interim dividend is
2.3p.

Mr Jim Slater, the one time stock market guru and entrepreneur, has agreed
together with shareholders representing the Sangsters to sell Arion, their
jointly-owned Edinburgh property company, to Harmony.
As part of an all-paper transaction, the two families will receive 12.3m new
Harmony shares at 5p, valuing Arion at Pounds 800,000.
Mr Guy Sangster, whose father Robert was chairman of Vernon Pools until its
acquisition by Thomson T-Line in 1988, is to become a non-executive director
of Harmony once the transaction has been approved by the Stock Exchange.
Mr Christopher Slater, whose father Jim became a share tipster after his
business empire failed, will remain as managing director of Arion.
The move marks Harmony's first sizeable acquisition since the board
announced a Pounds 1.8m rights issue earlier this year to fund the creation
of a property investment division. Harmony said it would be seeking other
all-paper acquisitions to build up its asset base.

FT  27 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Third quarter rise at Citizens Financial
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
CITIZENS Financial, the US subsidiary of Royal Bank of Scotland, reported
net income of Dollars 7.2m (Pounds 4.8m) for the third quarter to June 30.
That compared with Dollars 6.2m for the corresponding quarter and makes a
total for the year to date of Dollars 24.8m (Dollars 13.8m).
Citizens attributed the increase in third quarter income to continued strong
mortgage banking activity and income from its newly-acquired banking
operation in south-eastern Connecticut.
Tangible capital ratio at June 30 was 6 per cent and the total risk-based
capital was 11.17 per cent, compared with federal minima of 3 per cent and 8
per cent respectively.
Total assets at the quarter's end were Dollars 5.25bn (Dollars 4.46bn). The
increase, the company said, reflected the acquisition of the Plymouth Five
Cents Savings Bank in Massachusetts and the New England Savings Bank in
Connecticut.

FT  27 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Capita manages 15% advance to Pounds 2m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CAPITA GROUP, a provider of services to the public sector, reported pre-tax
profits up 15 per cent, from Pounds 1.77m to Pounds 2.04m, in the six months
to June 30.
Turnover rose to Pounds 22.1m (Pounds 13.7m) mainly because the company's
outsourcing division secured ten new contracts - three to manage local
authority information revenue and benefits administration, and seven in
computer services - tripling the number of contracts since the last year
end.
Outsourcing contributed turnover of Pounds 13.2m (Pounds 7.08m) and pre-tax
profits of Pounds 1m (Pounds 1.06m), giving a sharp fall in margins to 7.6
per cent (15.1 per cent). The shares closed 1p lower at 168p.
Mr Rod Aldridge, chairman and chief executive, said: 'The key to the
outsourcing business is creating economies of scale. Efficiency comes with
growth.'
The company said the new contracts had depressed margins because of the high
initial costs associated with reorganising public sector structures. Capita
also wrote off Pounds 300,000 in implementation costs.
Analysts said they would give the company the benefit of the doubt.
One said: 'It's all very plausible and this is still absolutely the business
to be in. Everything now depends on effective management.'
Another worry was the company's decision to move into revenue and benefits
administration which some analysts said offered less scope for scale
efficiencies.
The advisory and consultancy division contributed Pounds 8.89m (Pounds
6.65m) to turnover and Pounds 1.04m (Pounds 703,000) to pre-tax profits,
giving margins of 11.6 per cent (10.6 per cent).
Capita has integrated its Pounds 450,000 cash acquisition of Goldcrest -
made in April - within the property services arm of its outsourcing
operations. The company estimates it contributed Pounds 203,000 to turnover
and Pounds 11,000 to pre-tax profits.
At the half-way stage Capita had cash of Pounds 12.3m (Pounds 7.62m) and no
borrowings. Mr Aldridge said: 'A strong balance sheet is the key in our
market. People want to be confident that the company they are getting into
bed with for the next five years is not going to go bust.'
The interim dividend is 0.85p (0.7p), payable from earnings per share of
2.86p (2.53p).

Slater families
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HARMONY Leisure, the loss-making pubs and restaurants group, yesterday
announced an unexpected link-up with two of the City's best known families -
the Sangsters, former owners of Vernon Pools, and the Slaters, whose Slater
Walker merchant bank collapsed in the 1970s.
Mr Jim Slater, the one time stock market guru and property entrepreneur, has
agreed together with shareholders representing the Sangsters to sell Arion,
their jointly-owned Edinburgh property company, to Harmony.
As part of an all-paper transaction, the two families will receive 12.3m new
Harmony shares at 5p, valuing Arion at Pounds 800,000.
Mr Guy Sangster, whose father Robert was chairman of Vernon Pools until its
acquisition by Thomson T-Line in 1988, is to become a non-executive director
of Harmony once the transaction has been approved by the Stock Exchange.
Mr Christopher Slater, whose father Jim became a share tipster after his
business empire failed, will remain as managing director of Arion.
The move marks Harmony's first sizeable acquisition since the board
announced a Pounds 1.8m rights issue earlier this year to fund the creation
of a property investment division.
Yesterday, Mr John Main, chairman and joint managing director of Harmony,
said the Slaters' interest in fledgling property companies had been aroused
by Mr George Soros's recent investment in British Land, the commercial
property group.
'Harmony is an ideal shell vehicle for them,' Mr Main said. 'We are very
excited about the quality and commitment of the new investors. This
acquisition increases our asset base and brings in a good stream of rental
income.'
The pubs group will also be seeking other all-paper acquisitions to build up
its asset base, he added.

FT  27 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Merrydown declines by 11% as competition
bites
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STIFFER competition in the premium cider market contributed to an 11 per
cent decline in full-year pre-tax profits at Merrydown, the Sussex-based
cidermaker.
Though total cider volumes more than matched the overall market growth of 12
per cent, profits for the year to March 31 slipped from Pounds 1.93m to
Pounds 1.71m.
The shares fell 16p to 268p.
Trading profit was virtually unchanged at Pounds 2.33m on turnover ahead 11
per cent at Pounds 19.2m.
Merrydown Vintage Cider maintained its brand leadership in the premium
take-home market with a 27 per cent share but faced severe pressure on
pricing and margins from the launch of rival branded and private label
ciders.
'It is very doubtful whether the market can sustain all the new high alcohol
cider brands that have been launched,' said Mr Richard Purdey, chairman.
Merrydown's volume and prices were also affected by the impact of recession
on independent retailers in south-east England. However, sales of
Traditional Cider in cans continued to grow strongly and the group entered
the private label business which, Mr Purdey said, was starting to make a
'useful contribution' to profits.
Export sales advanced some 19 per cent to Pounds 900,000. Recession,
particularly in Germany, slowed progress in Europe but new business in South
America made a promising start.
Overseas profit contribution, however, remained minimal while high costs of
opening new markets are being incurred.
Interest charges rose from Pounds 425,000 to Pounds 621,000 as the company
invested heavily in relaunching its Vintage Ciderbrand and improving
production and bottling facilities. Borrowings at the year end were Pounds
5.26m against shareholders' funds of Pounds 13.8m.
Earnings per share fell from 15.24p to 13.03p but a final dividend of 6p
lifts the total by 12.5 per cent to 7p.
COMMENT
Merrydown, the pioneer of the premium cider market, is finding it tough
defending its ground against the rush of later, and bigger, entrants. But it
is difficult to fault its strategy for combating competition. Management has
been restructured and strengthened; it has invested heavily in relaunching
its leading cider brand and in production and bottling facilities that have
enabled it to enter the growing private label business; it has expanded into
the pub market for draught cider through an agreement with Gaymer Group and
has reduced its dependence on cider by acquiring adult soft drink brands
such as Piermont, Shloer and PLJ. Their contribution should enable Merrydown
this year to double pre-tax profits to Pounds 3.5m as the growth in cider
slows to an estimated 5 per cent. On a prospective p/e of 12.5 it looks
reasonably rated below Bulmer and Taunton.

FT  27 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Greggs rises 26% to Pounds 2.9m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GREGGS, the manufacturer and retailer of bread, confectionery and savoury
products, lifted pre-tax profits by 26 per cent, from Pounds 2.29m to Pounds
2.89m, in the 24 weeks to June 12.
Turnover improved to Pounds 48.3m (Pounds 45.3m); the 6.8 per cent rise
included a small increase in volumes through existing outlets.
Mr Mike Darrington, managing director, said the results reflected the
company's belief that the recession had ended but he was seeking steady,
long term growth rather than a boom. Gross margins had increased slightly
and the wage percentage of costs had reduced, reflecting both improved
volumes and tighter operational costs. The sandwich business grew strongly
but bread sales were relatively disappointing.
Earnings per share were ahead 27 per cent to 17p (13.4p), and the interim
dividend goes up to to 6p (5p).
Mr Ian Gregg, chairman, said because the second half of last year was much
stronger than the first, he did not anticipate comparative profit growth in
the second half of 1993 to be as pronounced as in the first half.
Mr Gregg announced he intended to 'formalise' existing arrangements by
becoming non-executive chairman.
The company had 492 outlets at June 12; it plans to open up to 10 more in
the remainder of 1993. In 1994 it plans record capital investment of Pounds
12m, half of it in London and the West Midlands.
Net cash now stands at Pounds 9m, almost Pounds 4m higher than this time
last year.

CRT GROUP, the training, recruitment and consultancy company, proposes to
lift the total dividend by 17 per cent despite a fall in pre-tax profits
from Pounds 6.16m to Pounds 3.3m in the year to April 30, hit by one-off
reorganisation costs and the recession.
Mr John Gittins, finance director, said the company used the Pounds 3.2m
(Pounds 3.7m) cash generation as a guide to setting the dividend level,
rather than headline profits.
The pre-tax profits were struck after charges of Pounds 1.5m (Pounds 0.8m)
to cover discontinued and exceptional items.
The exceptional charge has increased from the Pounds 630,000 reported at the
interim stage, reflecting the adoption of the new FRS 3 accounting standard
which meant reclassifying some extraordinary items, together with other
accounting changes and the establishment of provisions against future costs
associated with discontinued activities.
Total turnover, including Pounds 1.28m (Pounds 4.35m) from discontinued
operations, increased to Pounds 47m (Pounds 43.5m) and operating profits
declined to Pounds 4.73m (Pounds 6.07m) including a Pounds 147,000 (Pounds
481,000) loss on discontinued operations.
The company's core training division increased sales to Pounds 22.9m (Pounds
20.2m), contributing operating profits of Pounds 4.5m (Pounds 6.3m).
Mr Karl Chapman, chief executive said: 'The disappointing financial
performance in this division was largely a consequence of substantial
investment in the provision of training materials and improved quality
control processes.'
The company added Wetherby Training Services and Convergent Communications
to the division. The acquisitions contributed Pounds 1.69m to turnover and
Pounds 248,000 to operating profits.
The consultancy division contributed turnover of Pounds 6.5m (Pounds 5.5m)
and operating profits of Pounds 430,000 (Pounds 670,000), following 'a poor
start to the year'.
The recruitment division contributed an improved Pounds 16.4m (Pounds 13.4m)
to sales and operating profit of Pounds 800,000 (Pounds 400,000).
The board proposes a final dividend of 2.15p (1.825p) to give a total for
the year of 2.8p (2.4p). The dividend is payable from earnings per share of
4.2p (8.3p).

FT  27 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Disposal helps Union Discount return to
black with Pounds 11.3m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNION DISCOUNT, one of the City's leading discount houses, returned to
profit in the first half of 1993, largely due to its sale of Winterflood
Securities, the small companies marketmaking specialist.
The group announced pre-tax profits of Pounds 11.3m for the six months
ending June 30 1993, after reporting pre-tax losses of Pounds 14.8m last
time.
Discontinued operations produced an operating profit of Pounds 3.7m, while
disposals accounted for a further Pounds 6.5m. Operating profits on
continuing operations amounted to just Pounds 1.1m, a substantial
improvement on the Pounds 12.1m loss in the comparable period last year.
However, there is no interim dividend. Mr George Blunden, chief executive,
said the board wanted to see greater consistency in the company's
performance before restoring dividend payments, and would concentrate on
developing fee earning businesses.
But he added: 'It's my target that we should restore dividend payments by
the end of the year,' assuming the company's improved performance is
maintained.
Mr Blunden said that the first priority in restoring profitability was to
extricate the discount house from its disastrous foray into leasing,
undertaken in the 1980s.
He hopes that no further provisions will be needed and that the remaining
leasing businesses will be sold off or run down by the end of the year.
Union Discount shares have been trading at a substantial discount to their
net asset value, because of concern about its leasing businesses.
The news that Sabre Leasing, the largest leasing business, continued to make
a small profit even though the asset financing group lost Pounds 1m, 'has to
be encouraging,' according to Mr Martin Green, an analyst at Smith New
Court, 'but the market is still sceptical about any company involved in
leasing'.
The share price rallied 7p to 158p yesterday, still well below net asset
value of 220p. The results were in line with analysts' expectations.
Looking ahead, Mr Blunden said that the discount house would concentrate on
developing existing businesses, including the traditional discount house
business, jobbing, asset management and futures broking.
The capital released by winding down the leasing side will be used to
develop the group's capital markets operations in areas such as derivatives
and arbitrage trading.
Since the end of the first half, the group has acquired a majority stake in
Guildhall, a consultancy which advises financial institutions on risk
management.
Earnings per share, stripping out disposals and discontinued operations,
worked through at 3.78p, against losses of 87.8p.

FT  27 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Syndicate bank backs bid for Wm Hill
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE OF the syndicate of banks which has lent Pounds 350m to William Hill is
backing the Pounds 360m consortium bid for the betting shop chain, part of
Brent Walker.
A majority of the banks, including some which have also lent to Brent Walker
itself, are anxious that the bid, being put together by SG Warburg, should
be pursued, along with other proposals for William Hill.
For the first time Brent Walker admitted officially yesterday that it had
received an approach for William Hill.
The offer is from a group of investors advised by SG Warburg. It would be
structured about half-and-half in equity and new loans, with the equity
coming from a number of venture capital investors.
Brent Walker said it was seeking further information from the Warburg group.
A meeting was held between both sides last Friday when Warburg is understood
to have requested the chance to perform due diligence and talk to William
Hill's management.
William Hill is ring-fenced from the rest of Brent Walker and its debt is
due to be repaid or refinanced by March 1 next year. Brent Walker said it
was looking at a number of alternative proposals. These include possible
bids from other parties, the flotation of William Hill or even the
refinancing of the loan in March.
William Hill is one of the pillars on which the Brent Walker business plan,
which was agreed with bankers last year when they completed a Pounds 1.65bn
refinancing, is built.
Without William Hill, Brent Walker could find it difficult to service its
other debts.

HERON International, Mr Gerald Ronson's property group, has sold a half
share of a property in Brussels for Pounds 32m.
The price is above the value put on the property in the group's business
plan, underlying its Pounds 1.4bn refinancing.
The refinancing has still to be approved by the UK courts. A hearing began
yesterday, as five creditors owed Dollars 42m (Pounds 28m) are opposing the
scheme. The hearing was adjourned and a decision is not expected until later
this week.

FT  27 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Motor side boosts DC Cook
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A SUBSTANTIAL upturn in second half results of the motor division enabled DC
Cook, the Rotherham-based motor retail and property group, to report pre-tax
profits of Pounds 550,000 for the year to April 30, against Pounds 121,000.
At the interim stage the USM-quoted company recorded a loss of Pounds
56,000.
The pre-tax result was achieved after exceptional charges of Pounds 281,000
(Pounds 70,000) and lower interest costs of Pounds 1.48m (Pounds 2.09m).
Turnover was Pounds 108m (Pounds 107.6m), including Pounds 1.38m (Pounds
14.1m) from discontinued activities. Fully diluted earnings were 2.02p
(1.11p). After passing the interim dividend a final of 0.6p is recommended,
against last year's total of 0.5p.

FT  27 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Hartstone cuts purchase costs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FURTHER questions surfaced yesterday over acquisitions made by Hartstone,
the loss-making leathergoods and hosiery company which recently negotiated a
standstill agreement with bankers following the breach of several covenants.
Its annual accounts, published yesterday, showed that following further
investigation it would pay Pounds 4m less than planned for the lingerie arm
of Aznar, the hosiery company acquired in 1992.
Hartstone became one of Europe's leading hosiery and leathergoods companies
through a rapid succession of acquisitions. In January it said it would pay
Pounds 10.4m in cash and shares for Aznar Industrial. However, the group
said that the purchase price would now be Pounds 6.25m.
The company said that the balance of Pounds 4.1m, including an initial
payment of Pounds 3.7m, would be now be offset against the amount owed on
Aznar, the hosiery company and the lingerie group's original parent.
Mr Shaun Dowling, the chairman who replaced Hartstone's founder Mr Stephen
Barker, said the alteration was an accounting technicality.
The group earlier this month announced losses of Pounds 9.86m and Pounds 31m
in above the line charges. The results followed profits warnings and the
collapse of the share price from 272p in February to a low of 33p. The
shares have since recovered, closing at 60p last night, up 4p.
Analysts said yesterday that although the accounts were more detailed than
normal there remained several questions, particularly as to how Hartstone
would deal with difficulties arising from its high gearing of 120 per cent.
'After the standstill they have got a chance to trade their way out of some
difficulties but not enough to bring the debt down,' said one.
Observers speculated that the group would be forced to sell a business and
perhaps call on shareholders for cash. BDO Binder Hamlyn reinforced the view
in its auditors report, warning of the possibility of disposals 'at less
than current net book amounts'.

FT  27 JUL 93 / St James's makes Pounds 137m cash and paper payout
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ST JAMES'S Place Capital is to give shareholders its 37.6 per cent stake in
RIT Capital Partners, worth Pounds 104m, plus Pounds 32.7m in cash,
disentangling Lord Rothschild's two companies.
The distribution - subject to shareholder and court approval - was announced
by Lord Rothschild and Sir Mark Weinberg, joint chairmen of SJPC, at
yesterday's annual meeting.
By giving the stake in RITCP to shareholders, SJPC is indicating that it
will focus on being a financial services group rather than an investment
company, Mr Clive Gibson, a SJPC director, said yesterday.
SJPC would look at acquisitions in the financial services area and also be
ready to put more capital into its existing businesses, he said.
Rises in SJPC and RITCP's asset values since the March 31 year-end were also
announced. SJPC's net asset value had risen from 107.7p to 123.4p a share or
Pounds 335m, while RITCP's had gone up from 181.1p to 195.6p or Pounds 417m.
The RITCP stake is SJPC's largest investment, representing 27 per cent of
year-end assets. SJPC's other interests include insurance, through its stake
in J Rothschild Assurance; fund management, through J Rothschild Investment
Management, and J Rothschild Capital Management - which manages the RITCP
portfolio - and a 29.7 per cent stake in Global Asset Management; and
investment banking.
RITCP is an approved investment trust. It recently sold most of its largest
investment, a holding in Newmont Mining, worth Pounds 130m in March.
Shareholders in SJPC will receive 0.9895 shares in RITCP and 48p in cash for
every four SJPC shares. The distribution is counted as capital and so
subject to gains tax. The cash element is designed to cover the tax bills.
As a result of the hand-out, SJPC's net assets will fall by more than a
third to about Pounds 181m on the March valuation. SJPC shareholders can
expect the dividend to be reduced by a similar amount. It has been paying 3p
a year. The effect on investors' income should be small as they will also
receive the dividends on the RITCP shares and any interest on the cash.
The plan aims to cut the double discount which SJPC shareholders suffer on
their indirect holding of RITCP shares. RITCP shares fell 4p to 151p and
SJPC's shares rose 5p to 140p yesterday.

FT  27 JUL 93 / Boeing shares rise despite warning on lower sales trend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BOEING, the world's largest commercial aircraft manufacturer, yesterday
reported a slight drop in second quarter net income and warned that a trend
towards lower sales would continue into 1994, because of a global economic
slowdown.
However, Boeing shares rose sharply on the New York Stock Exchange, closing
at Dollars 38 5/8 , up Dollars  7/8 , because the results were ahead of
analysts' expectations.
The company reported net earnings of Dollars 426m (Pounds 283m), or Dollars
1.25 a share, on sales of Dollars 7.98bn for the second quarter, compared
with Dollars 432m, or Dollars 1.27 a share, on sales of Dollars 7.8bn in the
same period last year. Analysts had expected earnings per share of around
Dollars 1.05.
Mr Frank Shrontz, chairman, said second-quarter sales were higher than the
first quarter's Dollars 6.6bn because of the timing of commercial jet
deliveries.
In the first six months Boeing earned Dollars 751m, or Dollars 2.21 a share,
down from the Dollars 852m, or Dollars 2.50 a share exclusive of accounting
adjustments, in the same period of 1992. Sales fell from Dollars 15.79bn to
Dollars 14.63bn.
The drop in first-half earnings resulted largely from lower sales in its
commercial aircraft and defence and space businesses. Boeing delivered 202
commercial aircraft in the period, down from 243 in the first half of 1992.
Defence and space sales were around 14 per cent lower.
Mr Shrontz said Boeing continued to expect full-year sales of around Dollars
26bn, down from Dollars 30.2bn in 1992. Second-half sales would be about 20
per cent lower than the first half, and this was consistent with cuts in
production already announced by the company.
'Based on current programmes and schedules, the trend of lower sales levels
will continue through 1994,' said Mr Shrontz.
'New orders for commercial transports continue to be below current delivery
rates, and some customer requests to reschedule existing orders continue to
be negotiated.'
However, the company said operating profit margins on commercial jets were
expected to be 'substantially maintained' as Boeing moved into this period
of lower production. Margins also continued to improve in the defence and
space business.

FT  27 JUL 93 / Reuters steps gingerly off its pile of money: Andrew Bolger
explains why the UK business information group is keeping to its specialist
fields
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Christopher Hogg said bluntly: 'Too much cash is a curse, not a
blessing.'
The chairman of Reuters Holdings was explaining why the business information
and news group had decided to hand back up to Pounds 350m of its growing
cash pile to shareholders through a share repurchase scheme.
Sir Christopher said he felt 'a bit strange' about the operation, which has
been months in the planning. 'It's rationally sensible, but goes against the
grain of conventional wisdom - that managers who don't sit on a cash pile
need their heads examined.'
He insisted that the decision was a brave one: it showed the group was
anxious to guard against becoming 'sloppy' with cash, and against the risk
of not looking hard enough at the performance of existing businesses. 'Any
fool can spend money, the challenge is to spend it wisely.'
Reuters, the leading supplier of information and transaction products to the
world's financial centres, has been adjusting to a lower-growth environment
after the boom years of the 1980s.
After enjoying compound growth of 25-30 per cent per annum until a few years
ago, the group will be content with double-digit revenue growth this year.
This means it no longer needs the huge increases in working capital which
were required at the peak of the boom.
Sir Christopher said capital expenditure continued to be on a long-term
'rising trend'. Last year it rose from Pounds 148m to Pounds 194m, of which
Pounds 101m was spent on subscriber equipment.
Yet even that increase made little impact on the group's cash pile, which
grew from Pounds 503m to Pounds 710m. Pre-tax profits rose by nearly 13 per
cent to Pounds 383m - an impressive performance for a company struggling
with recession in its main markets.
Sir Christopher believes that Reuters should continue to concentrate on
specialist markets which allow maximum exploitation of its advanced
technology. 'Strategy will be unfolded in a measured manner designed to
retain Reuters' focus and ensure that its products will continue to be
differentiated by their careful targeting and close technical integration.'
Mr Peter Job, chief executive, was confident that the group's expertise in
news-gathering, database management and global network management made it
well placed to meet the growing demand for sophisticated products in the
financial services industry and the media. 'Timely investments in video
news-gathering and dissemination will allow Reuters to make the necessary
enhancements to its product line as multi-media technology develops
gradually into practical applications.'
Reuters last year took full control of Visnews, the international television
news agency, renaming it Reuters Television, and has also joined the
consortium which owns Independent Television News. Last month it announced
plans to launch a Hispanic satellite news service with BBC World Service
Television.
The former Visnews offices and the Reuters news bureaux are being combined,
with the aim of correspondents being able to file video pictures as well as
words. Eventually the 200,000 Reuters screens worldwide will be able to
offer subscribers live pictures of occasions which can move the market, such
as a major bank rate announcement.
Mr Job said the emerging 'multi-media' world offered big opportunities, but
also great scope to lose a lot of money, and he was determined to proceed
cautiously. 'We will limit acquisitions or diversifications to things which
add spice to, or leverage, the core businesses.'
Reuters' measured approach also reflects another concern - the group's
realisation that it cannot afford to be complacent about its position as
provider of financial information and transaction products, which account
for 93 per cent of group revenue.
The UK group maintains a dominant position, but is being increasingly
challenged by rivals such as Telerate, Knight-Ridder and Bloomberg, all of
which have targeted its blue-chip customer base and high profit margins.
At today's results meeting, Reuters will be quizzed on the progress of its
latest products, Dealing 2000-2, which offers automated foreign exchange
trading, and Globex, which serves the futures and options market.

FT  27 JUL 93 / Champagne loss hits LVMH
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LOSSES in the champagne business were the main reason for a 20 per cent fall
in net profits at LVMH, one of the world's largest luxury goods groups, in
the first half of the year.
Profits slid to FFr1.03bn (Pounds 116.3m) from FFr1.29bn in the first six
months of 1992.
Mr Bernard Arnault, chairman, last month warned of a fall in first-half
profits, but did not specify how steep. However, he also said he hoped that
profits would at least be maintained in the full financial year.
News of LVMH's decline comes at a sensitive time for the luxury goods
industry, which has been badly affected by recession and changing consumer
tastes. Gucci, another leading group, is in turmoil as Mr Maurizio Gucci,
chairman, struggles to break the deadlock on control of the company.
LVMH, which owns a string of prestigious products including Christian Dior
perfumes, Hennessy cognac and Louis Vuitton luggage, increased sales by 3.6
per cent in the first half to FFr10.04bn.
Turnover rose in every area of activity except champagne. The champagne
division, including the flagship Moet-et-Chandon brand, saw sales fall 7.4
per cent to FFr1.8bn and made a net loss of more than FFr100m because of
weak demand and rising raw material prices.
Perfume was the strongest sector, with sales rising 12.4 per cent to
FFr2.86bn, reflecting the success of new products such as Dior's Dune and
Givenchy's Amarige. Luggage sales rose 4.6 per cent to FFr2.43bn with cognac
and spirits sales up 2.3 per cent to FFr2.55bn.
LVMH also suffered from the impact of the strong franc on its international
interests, particularly in the UK.

FT  27 JUL 93 / TSB sells car hire arm to Midland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TSB GROUP yesterday continued its disposal of businesses outside its retail
banking core by agreeing to sell Swan National Leasing, its vehicle contract
hire business, to the leasing arm of Midland Bank.
Forward Trust Group, the Midland subsidiary, will pay Pounds 182.5m for SNL.
The sum includes Pounds 57.9m for the assets and Pounds 124.6m to repay debt
finance provided to the leasing business by TSB. The deal follows a setback
last week in TSB's disposal programme - it disclosed it had failed to agree
a selling price to place its estate agencies in a joint venture with
National &amp; Provincial Building Society.
The move leaves TSB with the Eurodollar car rental business of SNL, which it
is thought to be considering selling through a management buy-out. It has
also been trying to dispose of its Hill Samuel investment banking arm.
Mr John Burns, TSB's finance director, said SNL's pre-tax profit of Pounds
7.3m last year meant the Pounds 57.9m purchase price represented a post-tax
multiple of 13.1. He said this was in line with the multiples common in the
vehicle leasing business.
TSB would make an exceptional gain on the sale of Pounds 30.8m this year, as
well as releasing Pounds 57.9m in capital. It would have to deduct a
'relatively small' amount from the profit figure as an adjustment to
goodwill written off in reserves. Mr Graham Picken, Forward Trust's chief
executive, said that adding SNL's 26,000 vehicles and 300 staff to the
existing 14,000 vehicles would put the business in third place in the
vehicle leasing market.
He estimated that the earnings multiple had fallen to about 9 times in
current trading conditions because the SNL business was expected to make a
profit of about Pounds 10m this year. He also said it had re-financed the
SNL debt on better terms. He said Forward Trust was paying Pounds 30.8m in
addition to SNL's net asset value of Pounds 27.1m. About Pounds 18m of this
would be written off as goodwill paid in addition to the 'fair value' of
SNL.
TSB has signalled that it intends to dispose of a variety of non-core
businesses in order to return to its retail banking roots from which it
diversified unprofitably after its flotation in 1987.

FT  27 JUL 93 / S African draft constitution condemned by ultra-right
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATTI WALDMEIR
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE FIRST draft of a multiracial constitution for South Africa was unveiled
yesterday, provoking condemnation from the ultra-right Conservative party.
'It is a recipe for civil war, further economic deterioration and a spiral
of violence and crime, which will reduce the country to ruin,' said Mr Ferdi
Hartzenberg, the party leader, adding that the CP would not return to
negotiations.
Fears of heightened ethnic violence were expressed by many yesterday,
following Sunday's massacre of at least 10 people during a church service in
a white suburb of Cape Town.
Democracy negotiators charged with drawing up a constitution to ease
tensions in a multiracial state, published an outline of an interim
constitution under which the first elections would be held next April. This
would remain in force until a final constitution is agreed by an elected
assembly.
But the document, the product of months of negotiation, begged the most
important questions: how power should be shared within the planned
multi-party cabinet; and how it should be distributed between central and
regional governments.
The mainly-Zulu Inkatha Freedom party refused to attend yesterday's talks,
although the party executive met to consider the document. It is likely to
reject the draft. Inkatha has said it will continue with bilateral
negotiations but will not return to multi-party talks unless given an
effective veto over proceedings.
Analysts point out, however, that much recent progress has been achieved in
bilateral meetings between the three most important parties  - the ruling
National party, the African National Congress and Inkatha  - with agreements
then ratified by multi-party talks.
The draft constitution focuses on devolution of power to regional
governments. It provides also for heavy regional representation in the
national parliament, which will also draw up the final constitution.
It also lists a variety of areas - including health, education, local
taxation and local policing - in which regional governments would share
power with central government while a new constitution is finalised.
However, the issue of how power should be shared between the two levels of
government is deferred for consideration by an independent commission after
the first elections. A final decision on this issue would be left to the
multi-party cabinet and the elected constituent assembly.

FT  27 JUL 93 / France and UK signal improved relations at summit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING and PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN and France yesterday signalled a strengthening in bilateral
co-operation covering defence, foreign affairs and Europe. But the first
full-scale Franco-British summit since 1991 left the two sides still at odds
over completion of the Uruguay round of world trade talks.
After a day of talks headed by Mr John Major, the prime minister, Mr Edouard
Balladur, his French counterpart, and President Francois Mitterrand, the two
sides announced a series of agreements which confirmed the warming in
relations since Mr Balladur's conservative government took office in March.
Mr Major also voiced support for the embattled French franc, which has been
under sustained pressure on foreign exchange markets. 'It is not in anyone's
interests to have currency turmoil in Europe,' he said.
The agreements reached yesterday included an opening date for the Channel
tunnel. It will be officially opened by the Queen and Mr Mitterrand on May 6
next year.
On the EC, Britain and France said they had found much common ground
concerning subsidiarity - the decentralisation of decision-making from
Brussels to national governments. Mr Major said the two sides had agreed a
list of 24 items of community legislation that 'needed to be amended or
withdrawn'.
On defence, the two sides agreed that the joint nuclear weapons commission,
which defines joint policy on nuclear issues, would be made permanent.
While officials said they agreed on the need for a successful conclusion to
the Uruguay Round of world trade talks, they remained divided on
agriculture. 'We have a point of friction,' said Mr Mitterrand, referring to
the Blair House agreement on agricultural production between the EC and the
US which France has described as unacceptable in its present form.

FT  27 JUL 93 / MPs attack size of fees in Maxwell asset probes: Bill for
sorting out finances could exceed Pounds 100m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ACCOUNTANTS and lawyers unwinding the empire of the late Robert Maxwell are
charging too much for their services and are taking too long to recover
assets for pensioners, a committee of MPs said yesterday.
A report by the Social Security select committee said: 'The unravelling of
the chaos and confusion left by Robert Maxwell has so far cost the creditors
of the former companies, which include the pensioners, some Pounds 50m. The
final total cost could exceed Pounds 100m.'
Mr Frank Field, chairman of the committee, said the work to sort out the
tangled finances of the companies could take three to four more years.
The 30-page report singled out Buchler Phillips, an accountancy firm, and
its solicitors for criticism, noting that their Pounds 1.1m in fees to date
had resulted in a relatively low level of recoveries. It added that the sums
of what had actually been recovered appeared to have been overstated.
The committee urged the government to consider establishing an independent
monitor in the case of larger insolvencies to help *something in here (HP) *
determine whether the actions of practitioners and their fees were
appropriate. 'We are dependent on the judgments of the professionals
involved to tell us whether those costs are appropriate,' Mr Field said.
The committee noted that despite repeated requests to the various
administrators for detailed information about their fees and the profits
they were deriving from Maxwell-related business, only one, Mr John Talbot
of accountants Arthur Andersen, responded in detail.
The committee issued, but later rescinded, an order to the professionals to
provide the information, the report noted. It called on the Department of
Trade and Industry to widen its inquiry into corporate voluntary
administration and insolvency to include a review of recovery of assets.
The report also criticised several of the banks which dealt with Mr Maxwell,
particularly Lehman Brothers International and Credit Suisse. These two
resisted providing full details of transactions they handled, ultimately
forcing the liquidators to seek a court order.
The committee also criticised several leading insurance companies which
provided up to Pounds 100m in insurance policies for company officers and
pension fund trustees. The companies are now seeking to void their policies
on the basis that Mr Maxwell failed to inform them of his fraud.

FT  27 JUL 93 / The Lex Column: Union Discount
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Union Discount is living proof that financial institutions are at their best
when capital is scarce. Having made an ill-judged move into leasing during
the bountiful years of the late 1980s, it is now setting a fine example.
Cost-cutting, the introduction of a sharper trading style in the money
markets and the search for fee income amount to a more convincing strategy
than empire-building. It is a shame, then, that the hangover will take time
to shake off.
With capital still tied up in leasing, the discount house has been unable to
take full advantage of favourable money market conditions. Yet selling the
rump of leasing assets could result in further losses. Disposing of the
Winterflood market-making business earlier this year released capital as
well as bringing in cash. That should allow Union to pursue its ambitions in
bond arbitrage and futures trading. Fee-based activities such as asset
management and consultancy do not require much capital backing, but building
these businesses from a small base promises to be an incremental process.
If Union can prove its more adventurous trading style will turn in steady
profits - and support a dividend - the shares should rise from the current
discount to net assets. But its future lies more as a collection of niche
businesses than the grand City institution its name implies.

FT  27 JUL 93 / The Lex Column: TSB Group
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Having failed to get rid of its estate agencies last week, TSB has
successfully disposed of its Swan National Leasing business to Forward
Trust. A price equivalent to more than twice book value looks respectable.
Seen in terms of a historic exit multiple of 13 times for a cyclical
business which has only just passed the trough, it is less attractive.
Forward Trust is hardly over-paying for a business with recovery prospects
that will also expand its vehicle fleet by more than 50 per cent. While TSB
is under no financial pressure to sell peripheral businesses, it needs to
maintain the momentum. Otherwise its strategy of focusing on retail banking
and insurance will lose credibility. The satisfaction in the Swan National
deal is that the tidying-up process continues. It would be more important to
realise a full price for Hill Samuel which contributed Pounds 88m to profits
last year. At least its aborted estate agency deal shows there is a point
where TSB will draw the line.
The more successful TSB's disposals policy, though, the more it will face a
problem of surplus capital. Despite its best efforts to lose money in recent
years, its tier one ratio is still above 8 per cent. Mortgage lending and
insurance consume less capital than many traditional banking activities. In
returning capital to its shareholders, Reuters has set an example that TSB
should consider following.

FT  27 JUL 93 / The Lex Column: News Corporation
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Doubtless there is a great untapped market for satellite television in Asia.
Whether it will be profitable for the companies that enter it remains to be
seen. The market requires expensive libraries of programmes in many
languages. The geography and unsophisticated financial infrastructure of
parts of the region will make it difficult to operate encrypted subscription
services. That makes the venture more heavily dependent on uncertain
advertising revenues. The attitude of the Chinese government will also be
critical. Given that satellite television is very difficult to control, the
Chinese authorities may be slow to sanction the widespread ownership of
dishes.
News Corporation's acquisition of a stake in Star TV is thus something of a
calculated gamble. But at least Mr Rupert Murdoch has stacked the odds in
his favour. News Corp's library of English language programmes from Fox and
BSkyB will expand Star's attraction to the English-speaking Asian audience
which stretches from the Gulf to Japan. That group is mostly concentrated in
areas where subscription services may be feasible. Cable services into Hong
Kong provide a ready market, and Star already owns a large library of
Chinese language films. News Corp has also reduced the risks by using equity
to fund the purchase - albeit at the expense of diluting earnings.
Perhaps the most important facet of the deal, however, is that Mr Murdoch
has effectively shut other companies out of Star. That both guarantees a
market for Fox's output and gives the company a head start in Asia. If there
is a profitable niche, News Corp is now best placed to step into it.

FT  27 JUL 93 / The Lex Column: Reuters' happy returns
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
At last Reuters appears to have devised a commendable solution to its
embarrassment of riches. By repurchasing 5.8 per cent of its shares, Reuters
can distribute Pounds 350m of cash in a way that is more tax efficient than
simply increasing its dividend. But the move will inevitably revive
questions about whether its business is now mature.
Share buy-back schemes are certainly preferable to one-off dividends in that
they contain a greater element of choice. Shareholders may receive different
net gains depending on their particular tax regime. Theoretically, at least,
those who choose not to tender their shares for repurchase should not be
disadvantaged. They should end up with a proportionately bigger
shareholding, enhanced earnings and a higher share price.
Nevertheless, there tends to be a prejudice - at least in the UK - against
companies giving back money. The implication is that if managers cannot
spend it sensibly they should be replaced by more imaginative types. Such
criticisms chime resonantly in Reuters' case given the doubts about its
long-term growth prospects.
But Reuters retains the capacity to generate and spend money at a fiendish
rate. Its capital spend last year rose 31 per cent to Pounds 194m. Having
installed a vast array of terminals, it is now devising ever more means of
squeezing revenue from them. Multi-media also offers promising
opportunities. Even so, it will not be long before Reuters' free cash-flow
of Pounds 200m creates another money mountain. At least, shareholders now
have some reason for hope that Reuters is less likely to blow it on
something silly. How investors in Boots must wish its management had
exercised such restraint.

It is difficult to imagine Joe Public doing anything other than uttering a
loud cheer at the insurance industry's latest round of difficulties.
First the Treasury launches an assault on its sales practices by calling for
an even bigger clean-up than the one proposed by the Office of Fair Trading.
Now, the Commons Social Security Committee has taken a tilt at its
reluctance to pay up.
The committee, chaired by the increasingly terrier-like Frank Field,
complains in its latest report on the Maxwell pensions saga that the
insurers operate 'a gentleman's agreement philosophy' when issuing and
renewing policies, but turn horribly legalistic when the poor old pension
fund trustees put in their claims.
The locus classicus is the largest of the Maxwell policies, known as the
crime policy, providing Pounds 40m of cover for the dishonest
misappropriation of assets by the employees of the Maxwell companies. If
that's not what the late Cap'n Bob was up to, what on earth was it that he
perpetrated?
Aha, say the insurers, but since he failed to disclose the fraud to the
insurers at the renewal date - likely one, that - the policy is voidable.
Along with a string of other excuses, they even manage to argue that since
Maxwell and his aides were directors of the company, they were not employees
as such.
The industry explanation is that the whole concept of insurance is based on
the idea of utmost good faith. What that means, apparently, is that the
insurers are prepared to hand back the premiums. But Field is not impressed.
When it comes to Robert Maxwell, his committee remarks, the insurance
companies 'can be added to the growing list of organisations and individuals
who were only too willing to accept his money and equally willing to ignore
his track record'.

The suicide of Raul Gardini, laid to rest in his home town of Ravenna,
struck a chord among many of the inhabitants of the sleepy seaside town. On
a gloriously sunny Sunday, long lines of mourners had already formed outside
the church where his body lay, and thousands more, stunned by the
circumstances of his death, gathered yesterday to bid farewell at a moving
funeral service.
While Ravenna will not easily forget its most famous son, whatever his
misdemeanours, the apparent reconciliation of Ferruzzi family members around
Gardini's tomb is much less likely to endure.
Rumours are already circulating that there may be attempts at legal action
against the Gardini branch, revisiting the 1991 deal when Gardini's wife,
Idina, nee Ferruzzi, sold her stake in the Serafino Ferruzzi family holding
company back to her brother and two sisters for the sum of L505bn (Pounds
208m).

Meanwhile what on earth is the Bank of England doing giving half a million
pounds to double the size of its Houblon-Norman fund so that it can finance
yet more academic research into central banking matters? The Maxwell
pensioners or the depositors in BCCI might well believe they have prior
claims if there is spare cash about.
As for the sum involved, Pounds 500,000 might sound a lot but, if the aim
were to maintain the real value of the original 1944 endowment of Pounds
100,000, topped up by Pounds 50,000 in 1967, then the Bank should have
injected much more loot. Observer's calculations suggest that the value of
the combined endowments has slipped to 21 per cent of their original value
in real terms.
Is this why the first research project for 1993-94 is to inquire into index
bonds and inflationary expectations?

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The wisdom of Prometheus is something to which all top officials of the Bank
of England aspire. So it is fitting that the Bank has hired Geoffrey Burgon,
who wrote an opera about the Greek titan and is one of the most eclectic of
Britain's modern composers, to think up a tune to celebrate the Old Lady's
300th anniversary next year.
The work will be performed next Summer (pencil in June 8 at the Barbican),
and looks like being one of the lighter moments in a year of celebrations of
the Bank's tercentenary. Other highlights include a Service of Thanksgiving
at St Paul's, a new Pounds 50 note issue, and a conference of 130 central
bank governors and other international big-wigs.
As for the Bank's new theme tune, new governor Eddie George is giving the
composer a free hand and will learn about the score only on the day of the
performance. Like 'Hard Eddie', Burgon was a late developer and got
interested in music only at the age of 15, when he learned the trumpet.
An enthusiast for old cars, Burgon has made a mint by taking an unashamedly
commercial attitude to music, mainly through creating easy-listening
signature tunes for TV series, such as Brideshead Revisited and Chronicles
of Narnia.
He has also plunged into serious music through works, such as a Requiem and
writing scores for ballets, including Persephone and Ophelia.
Given the topsy-turvy environment of central banking, especially in the
light of recent exchange-market turbulence, Burgon could seek inspiration
from his recent concerto, The Turning World.
Better still, he could throw in a few variations from one of his recent
songs - I Went to Heaven.
Now that would strike a chord with any central banker.

FT  27 JUL 93 / Pretty penny on the price of a pinta: A shake-up that will
unleash competition on the UK milk market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES and MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As 300 dairy farmers converge on London's Queen Elizabeth conference centre
today, for the last annual general meeting of the Milk Marketing Board, they
fear that the milk market is about to turn sour. The meeting coincides with
final passage of the Agriculture Bill, which will abolish the board and its
statutory monopoly over milk purchasing in the UK.
The end of the monopoly under which farmers must sell their milk to the milk
board, which then sells it to dairies, will unleash free-market forces on an
industry which has been strictly controlled for 60 years. Competition could
encourage a confusing free-for-all, which could, ironically, lead to
consumers paying a higher price for a 'pinta'.
Quoted dairy companies have already seen their share prices fall as
investors fear the new regime will hit profits.
The changes in the milk industry bear the hallmarks of the government's
privatisation of the energy industry, particularly British Gas, which has
faced years of regulatory struggle and investigation by competition
authorities because it was privatised as a monopoly.
The milk board system - the sole milk outlet for the UK's 29,000 dairy
farmers - was set up in 1933, when five boards were formed; one covering
England and Wales, which now accounts for more than 80 per cent of the UK's
milk production, three in Scotland and one in Northern Ireland. All five are
to be abolished.
Their monopoly developed because farmers needed to forge themselves into a
strong sales body to counter the buying power of the large dairy companies.
According to one dairy executive: 'In the 1930s farmers were crudely abused
by the dairy companies,' which were buying milk when they needed it, but
refusing to take it in slack periods.
The board system brought order to the market. Farmers sell their milk to the
board, which pays them the same 'pool' price, regardless of the quantity of
milk sold or the distance the tanker must travel to their farm. Farmers have
come to rely on the daily tanker collections and monthly milk cheque.
'The milk board system is strong in the farmer's culture, and farmers are
conservative people,' said one dairy executive.
Farmers are worried about the effect of the reforms. 'I can well remember my
father pouring milk down the drain and, frankly, it frightens me to death
does this new set-up,' said one Yorkshire dairy farmer.
The milk board for England and Wales will become Milk Marque on April 1 next
year, reformed as a voluntary co-operative. Its final proposals have still
to be agreed by the government. The other boards are expected to announce
similar plans.
Milk Marque hopes to sign up most of the farmers selling to the board and so
retain more than 80 per cent of milk production in England and Wales. If it
achieves that aim, it will give farmers the security of price and collection
many seek. But it could be open to accusations of abusing its dominant
market position if it forces up prices to dairy company buyers, which in
turn may pass them to consumers.
Several dairy companies and food processors - such as Northern Foods, Nestle
and MD Foods - plan to challenge Milk Marque by buying their milk direct
from farmers or setting up their own co-operatives. They argue that Milk
Marque will, in effect, be merely a milk broker, which will add to
consumers' costs without providing any benefits.
The battle to sign up farmers has begun. Advocates of Milk Marque are
playing on some farmers' fears that the difficulties of the pre-1933 era
will return. 'We're dealing with some large and very powerful buyers and our
only hope is to stand united,' said Mr Meurig Raymond, whose South Wales
farm has 500 cows.
'As a farmer, if you tie your fortunes to just one company, you will rise
and fall with the success of that company and not have the broad selling
power that will be associated with Milk Marque,' said Mr Andrew Dare, chief
executive of the Milk Marketing Board who will head the new organisation.
'We're not just a milk broker; we're the farmer's marketing and distribution
department.'
Mr Dare is hinting at higher prices as an inducement for farmers to join
him. He believes a more competitive market will mean price increases of up
to 10 per cent. In 1992-93 the 'pool' price was 21p a litre, and is expected
to be 22p-23p this year. That could rise to as much as 25p a litre by 1995,
according to Mr Dare.
Still higher prices are being suggested by the Northern Milk Partnership,
the leading rival to Milk Marque, set up as a 50-50 joint venture between
Northern Foods and the farmers who will supply it.
'Northern will pay a milk price higher than the Milk Marque pool price,'
promises the brochure sent by the partnership to 17,000 dairy farmers. It
also assures farmers of daily collections and monthly cheques.
Northern Foods buys 2bn litres of milk a year, 17 per cent of total
production in England and Wales, and aims to secure all its supplies through
NMP. Mr Neil Davidson, senior operating executive in charge of milk policy
at Northern Foods, said it is 'very confident' of getting the milk it needs.
Some dairy groups - such as Northern Foods, Unigate and Avonmore Foods  -
believe they can offer more to farmers for their milk because they already
pay a premium to the Milk Marketing Board under the current arcane system.
Milk is sold at different prices according to its use. Liquid milk costs
more than milk for cheese and butter so some companies pay more for
supplies.
Farmers are thus in the enviable position of seeing milk buyers squabble
over their loyalty. But who pays for the higher prices that farmers may
receive for their milk?
Mr Dare contends that increased payments for farmers will not necessarily
mean a rise in customers' prices. He says that dairy companies and
processors - particularly butter and cheese makers - should absorb the
higher costs because they will be getting a better service and assured
supplies.
Dairy companies believe that Milk Marque should absorb some of the potential
price rise by cutting costs, something Mr Dare is committed to achieving.
Northern Foods on the other hand pledges to pass increased costs to the
consumer. Mr Davidson said: 'Any increase in milk prices will have to be
recovered from the marketplace.'
Prices could rise anyway, because of the tight market for milk in the UK.
When the milk board system was set up there was a surplus of milk, giving
the dairy companies the upper hand. Now, after nearly 10 years of European
Community milk quotas, the UK produces only about 85 per cent of its needs,
with most of the rest imported as butter and cheese.
Dairy processors are eager to secure milk supplies to keep their factories
running at full capacity, and thus operating as efficiently as possible.
One dairy executive expressed his fears: 'We are likely to find quite a
scramble for milk from April 1 next year to keep the processing plants
going. The first year will be difficult and milk will get more expensive.'
Many dairy executives privately admit they expect Milk Marque to capture
more than 80 per cent of the milk supplies, at least initially. But several
observers believe that, once farmers see some of the advantages to be gained
from competition in the marketplace, they could start splitting off to form
local or regional co-operatives similar to those in continental Europe.
Some critics believe the government should not allow Milk Marque to become a
national monopoly once the Milk Marketing Board's hold on the market has
been removed. Competition could develop more effectively if it were split up
into regional units. Otherwise, UK consumers could end up paying for a freer
market in milk, while farmers enjoy the benefits of security and stable
prices.

FT  27 JUL 93 / Leading Article: Sabotaging the rouble
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
LAST WEEKEND'S charade, instigated by the Russian central bank, must finally
have confirmed to the satisfaction of anyone who still doubted it that the
bank is determined to subvert economic reform in Russia. Much more worrying
is yesterday's decision by President Yeltsin to soften, rather than rescind,
the terms of the central bank's monetary confiscation. At best, it suggests
that Mr Yeltsin does not understand the outrage felt by the reformers in his
cabinet. At worst, it suggests the reformers no longer have the president's
support.
The events of the last few days have combined tragedy and farce, both with a
strong sense of historical irony. It is only a little over two years since
President Gorbachev's prime minister, Valentin Pavlov, tried to solve
Russia's inflationary problems by confiscating bank notes.
Then, as now, the policy caused chaos and public outrage while achieving
nothing of value. The government's gaping budget deficit has remained, while
other republics have continued to emit rouble credits. Indeed, this latest
act will only make things worse. By guaranteeing to exchange up to Rbs35,000
worth of old rouble notes for new ones up until August 7, the central bank
has actively encouraged roubles issued in other republics to flow back into
Russia. By extending the date until the end of August and raising the upper
limit to Rbs100,000, President Yeltsin's compromise has only made this
inflationary problem worse.
The tragedy is that this policy shift will now, deliberately or mistakenly,
undermine the fragile confidence in the rouble as a store of value that had
grown over the past two months. Confidence in the currency had allowed the
central bank to accumulate up to Dollars 1bn in foreign exchange reserves
last month, essential if the government is to fix the exchange rate and
stabilise inflation. Now, as the prospects for stabilisation recede, the
bank's new-found reserves are likely to vanish just as fast.
The farce is that this decision, to confiscate old roubles and thus violate
the contract between issuer and holder of money in Russia, was taken by the
central bank, at a weekend's notice without consulting, let alone seeking
the support of, the finance minister. This is the nature of government in
today's Russia.
Thus the sad history of Russia's latest encounter with economic reform moves
again to a climax. In Mr Yeltsin's hands, it has become a play without
director or sense of direction. Only if President Yeltsin now acts
decisively should aid continue to flow. He must publicly back the reformers
in his cabinet, repudiate the misjudgments of recent days, sack the central
bank officials responsible and allow the reformers to take control of
monetary policy. Until he does so, the west should resist Moscow's urgent
plea for a further tranche of western aid. Without such aid, Russia's
reforms will not succeed; without presidential willpower, such aid will be
worse than useless.

FT  27 JUL 93 / Personal View: Gatt effort must not be wasted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DR SERGIO ABREU BONILLA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Seven years after the current Uruguay round of the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade began, there are renewed hopes that the negotiations will
be successfully concluded. However, before considering how this might be
achieved, it is worth asking whether the circumstances of 1986 remain the
same and, if so, whether the objectives are still valid.
Substantial changes have taken place: The world political framework has been
transformed, through, for example, the end of the cold war. Eastern European
countries are being transformed into market economies and are becoming part
of the world trade system, although some have not yet completed their
process of integration to Gatt.
Developing countries are achieving significant structural change. According
to Gatt data, there are 72 governments that have adopted policies for
commercial liberalisation.
Regional and sub-regional integration aimed at providing better commercial
conditions within member countries has made great headway. And in 1992
alone, the secretary of Gatt recorded 17 new regional agreements on trade.
Growth in international trade in 1992, both of merchandises (4.5 per cent in
volume) and services (8 per cent), would suggest that the conclusion of the
Uruguay round has not been necessary in the promotion of the world trade.
However, it would be a serious mistake to leave it like this, as the growth
was due to a convergence of factors and not to a consolidated trend. The
tendency since 1988 has been for trade and world production to slow down.
A balanced and substantial package is needed to achieve economic expansion
through world trade. According to recent studies, the opening of product
markets as a consequence of the Uruguay round would inject as much as
USDollars 200bn annually into the international economy. With this, trade
will become the basis for the development and growth of nations.
Likewise, common rules must be reinforced in the process of regional
integration, enabling all parties to benefit from the expansion of world
trade. This process not only has to be consistent with the articles of Gatt
but also has to converge with the principles and objectives of international
free trade and of multilateralism.
A successful conclusion of the negotiations is essential for strengthening
the economic reforms and the liberalisation processes of developing
countries, which have been frequently undertaken under difficult political
and social conditions. This effort should not be wasted, as it is a vital
factor in integrating developing economies within the international economic
trade system.
As for industrialised countries, the growth of world trade within a more
stable, balanced and foreseeable framework will lead to macroeconomic
stability, with favourable consequences for employment and investment. At
the same time, it will slow down protectionist trends and will help to
eliminate commercial tensions and deter countries from introducing
commercially retaliatory measures.
The answer to these challenges cannot lie on technical arguments, for, after
seven years of negotiations, the problems and their likely solutions have
already been thoroughly identified. The Final Act Draft, presented in 1991
by Mr Arthur Dunkel, former director-general of Gatt, is an adequate basis
to reach final agreements and comply with the goals of the Punta del Este
Declaration.
The conclusion of the Uruguay round must be regarded as the political
responsibility of the participating governments which would have to be ready
to assess and make the concessions which the global agreement demands.
The recent Group of Seven meeting in Tokyo seems to show the clear and
concise will of the principal commercial partners to conclude the
negotiations. This has contributed to the round's relaunch and has given it
the impulse for Gatt secretary-general, Mr Peter Sutherland, to proceed
towards the final stage, one of the thorniest of the round.
The responsibility of the G7 members in the conclusion of the round is
undoubtedly great, but the success of negotiations will depend upon the
effort and the commitment which all 113 contracting parties of the Gatt
assign to this enterprise. All of them must encourage the growth,
development and economic welfare of their own countries as an essential step
towards strengthening the supreme values of democracy, social justice,
freedom and dignity.

FT  27 JUL 93 / Leading Article: Cash returns
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
REUTERS' DECISION to spend Pounds 350m of spare cash buying back its own
shares deserves to be more widely imitated. The idea of buy-backs has never
really taken root in the UK, despite its continued popularity in the US.
Even GEC, the UK pioneer of the scheme, has not bought in shares since the
mid-1980s. But the rationale is becoming increasingly persuasive. If extra
cash is scarcely a pressing problem for UK companies, it is at least more
common than it was. This year, for the first time in five years, the UK
corporate sector looks like generating a financial surplus. Meanwhile, the
return on cash is abnormally low in relation to other forms of investment,
so there is a greater opportunity cost to shareholders in leaving money
idle. The traditional way of managers with spare cash is to buy things; but
acquisition, especially for purposes of diversification, is decidely out of
fashion.
There can be exceptions to the general rule. GEC, for instance, could defend
its decision to stop buying shares on two grounds. First, the
rationalisation of its particular industry may have further to run, so that
spare cash may genuinely be held for a strategic purpose. Second, like many
other UK-based multinationals, GEC has a potential problem with advance
corporation tax, since buying in shares counts for tax purposes as a
distribution of income. Other companies with cash mountains have less
excuse. In particular, drug companies like Glaxo and Wellcome, faced with
the likely prospect of dwindling returns on new investment in the harsher
world of the 1990s, might care to explain to shareholders why they should
continue acting as their bankers.
The argument could perhaps be taken a stage further. It is worth asking why
companies, in giving shareholders their cash back, should require something
in return: in this case, their shares. There was a time when UK companies
took the same attitude over demergers, so that Racal shareholders, for
instance, had to pay cash for their shares in Vodafone, which as a Racal
subsidiary they owned already. It is a measure of progress that shares in
demergers are now routinely distributed free, as was the case with
Courtaulds or ICI.
By the same argument, more companies might care to consider handing back
cash in the simple form of a one-off dividend. Reuters could argue that the
buy-back method gives shareholders a choice between taking their money and
leaving it where it is; and the latter option may be preferable, depending
on the shareholder's tax position. But the snag about buy-backs is that they
have the largely cosmetic effect of increasing earnings per share on the
reduced capital. In some companies at least, the result would be that
shareholders end up paying managers bigger bonuses. If in doubt, managers
should remind themselves that in any transaction of this kind, the
shareholder is king.

<TEXT>
IT WAS BAD enough for present and future pensioners in the Maxwell business
empire to be fleeced by the late, unlamented publishing baron. For them now
to be plucked by the accountants and lawyers as well, in one of the most
unwieldy insolvencies of all time, is simply unconscionable. Yet that, to
judge by the evidence in the Social Security Select Committee's latest
report, is precisely what is happening. No doubt the eight professional
firms that have so far charged Pounds 51.6m for their insolvency work are
convinced that this is a fair reward for a difficult job. But the Select
Committee, chaired by Mr Frank Field, is rightly sceptical. It is a scandal.
The Maxwell insolvency, like those at Polly Peck and Bank of Credit and
Commerce International, is exceptionally complex. There are, inevitably,
jurisdictional problems in unwinding cross-border business groupings. Record
keeping in the Maxwell companies was often shoddy in the extreme. Where
fraud is involved, the purpose of the records is anyway to throw the outside
inquirer off the scent. It follows that the Maxwell insolvency was always
going to be an expensive classic of its kind. But the size of the
professional charges, which Mr Field's committee expects to top Pounds 100m
by the end of the process, raises wider questions about the checks and
balances in the insolvency system.
Preferential and secured creditors, by definition, have little reason to be
concerned about costs because they have first bite at the cherry. The real
burden falls on the unsecured creditors; and they have difficulty second
guessing large firms of accountants and lawyers if they suspect that they
are stringing out a receivership or administration for the sake of
generating additional revenue. The obvious sanction - going to court - is an
expensive option. Nor does it seem worth the bother of making a fuss if the
pay-off amounts to 4p rather than 3p in a pound that has already been
whittled away by prior claims.
Mr Field puts a case for an independent state-appointed monitor of the
larger insolvencies, along the lines of the US-style examiner. This
certainly merits consideration. But the real flaw in the system stems from
the undue weight given to the claims of the Inland Revenue, the Customs &amp;
Excise and the banks, relative to those of ordinary creditors including
pensioners, for whom the protracted nature of insolvency proceedings is a
particularly harsh burden. Equally striking is the inability of the Maxwell
pensioners to seek redress against a government which may be in breach of
legal obligations, for want of resources.
A review of the system, says the committee, is a priority. Yes, indeed.
There has to be a middle way between the US Chapter 11 system, which leaves
the bankrupt company in the hands of the management that wrecked it, and the
UK approach, which leaves the cadaver at the mercy of the professionals.

FT  27 JUL 93 / Letter: Perverse satisfaction in alienating audience
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PETER RUPERT LIGHTE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Even if I had not been in the audience of Julian Grant's opera, A
Family Affair, I still might have felt obliged to write about Max Loppert's
performance in print ('Not so comic capers', July 10). The stridency of his
tone more than drowns out the work he so bitterly criticises and the
libretto of his dialogue is itself worthy of music. After all, it is Mr
Loppert who suggests that A Family Affair is too good even to need music,
making the case, therefore, that the music of an opera is best matched to an
unworthy libretto.
Among the serious music crowd, there seems to be perverse satisfaction taken
in the alienation of the audience from the music. Such elitism is ironic,
indeed, since most people subscribing to the inaccessibility of the arts
fancy themselves very much of the people. The greatest fear is popularity
which is seen as the steep and slippery slide to Lloyd-Webberism.
The reception of Grant's work highlights the victimisation of opera
audiences intimidated into enduring the personal statements of precious
composers by the musical poobahs who all too often applaud these composers'
new clothes. Ironically, the critics of modern music have become the very
establishment from whom they claim to protect us; thus, the revolutionary
archaism of A Family Affair poses so great a threat because it connects
directly with the audience, thereby sweeping aside the cultural vigilantes
who tell us they know best.

FT  27 JUL 93 / Letter: Child care tax proposal illogical
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Ms MARY CAMPBELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Victoria Tomlinson is out of order in her complaints that (a) the cost
of a training course for her nanny is not tax-deductible and (b) the cost of
a nanny is not tax-deductible (Letters, July 16).
Rightly or wrongly, much other training, for example business school
courses, is not tax deductible. It would be wrong for a nanny's training to
be made an exception.
Making the costs of child-care tax-deductible would effectively penalise
parents who earn little and parents who give up work (and therefore
earnings) to care for their children. The parents who would benefit most
from making child-care tax deductible are richer ones who do not want to
look after their children.
Ms Tomlinson complains that she cannot run her business without child care.
Just because you cannot work without something does not mean it should be
tax deductible. On that basis, for example, transport to and from place of
work should be tax deductible.
If the state wishes to contribute more towards child care it should increase
child benefit (which should, incidentally, be taxable on the caring parent,
usually the first name on the child benefit book). This leaves choice in the
hands of the parents as to the form of care (lower income because you do it
yourself/care at work/care close to home etc). It also means that parents
under most pressure - particularly single parents on low incomes - would be
helped most.
Making place-of-work child care tax deductible was logically the wrong
approach.

FT  27 JUL 93 / Letter: Taking issue with generalisations and costs of
options
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JAN S SORENSEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, With reference to the article 'Exotic options fit the bill' (July 19),
we oppose two views expressed in that article.
1. Knock-out options: 'They are generally about 35 per cent cheaper than
other options'.
To say that they are generally 35 per cent cheaper is a very misleading
generalisation. The reduction in the premium of a knock-out option compared
to a plain vanilla option depends primarily on the level of the out-strike
(knock-out level). As the 'out-strike' is determined by the client the
premium reduction could be anywhere from 0 to 99 per cent. Also it is
important to understand that the reduction in premium is obtained by
accepting a risk that the hedge might vanish if the out-strike level is
reached.
2. Instead of buying options, companies can replicate options by dynamic
hedging. 'This method creates substantial savings', according to Mike
Shilling. That means options are overpriced.
Based on trading experience and empirical research, we do not find that FX
option prices in general are overpriced. Taking into account the transaction
costs and gamma risk associated with such a strategy we do not believe that
'dynamic hedging' is appropriate for hedging purposes. Actually such a
strategy would probably be more expensive and dangerous for companies in the
longer term.

FT  27 JUL 93 / Letter: Only way to compete effectively
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JOHN FARAGO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Without spending Pounds 40 to buy the report, it is hard to understand
why 'The impact of Japanese firms on working and employment practices in
British manufacturing industry' is given sufficient credence and status to
merit a front page story in the Financial Times ('Doubts over effectiveness
of Japan-style work practices', July 19).
The management methods which have made Japanese industry and Japanese-owned
industries in Britain and other countries so successful - attention to
quality systems, quality products, statistical process control, flexible
manufacturing, empowering workers to control and improve process and, above
all, loyalty by employers to employees - have been adopted by successful
British companies for years.
The argument about the benefit of 'Just-in-time' supplies - that reduction
of storage space, reductions in working capital, and early discovery and
correction of faulty inputs far outweigh the risks of inherent disruptions -
was settled some 25 years ago. It is too complacent to imply that old
British work practices are less likely to lead to worker resentment and
disruption than today's world-class best practice, whether of Japanese or
any other origin.
As for the danger to health and life of working too hard, has the risk of
death through overwork been compared with the well-documented increase in
illness and death in the UK resulting from unemployment? The most likely
consequence of not adopting competitive management styles and work practices
is no work at all.

FT  27 JUL 93 / Letter: Good example for timber production management
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JEAN-PIERRE KIEKENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The terms of the new International Cocoa Agreement ('Cocoa pact goes
for output management', July 20) should be most instructive to the
negotiation of the International Tropical Timber Agreement (ITTA). The cocoa
agreement rightly puts the emphasis on production management, whereas ITTA
negotiators still discuss, among other aspects, the suitability of a
reference to 'Target 2000', according to which all tropical timber reaching
international markets should be 'sustainably produced' by that date. Instead
of discussing time targets, ITTA negotiators would be better off to
concentrate on production management.
This would be most suitable to the ITTA, as it would lead to better prices
for tropical timber producers and a more environmentally friendly
exploitation of the tropical rain forest.
Environmental and economic objectives would be simultaneously addressed, and
the international tropical timber trade would stand a chance of subsisting
in the long run.

FT  27 JUL 93 / Soft heart of our problem: The chancellor's dilemma - an
inside view
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BILL ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Social security is at the heart of our budget difficulties. That is not
merely be-cause it is the largest single public spending programme, nor even
because it is growing so fast. It is because it is demand-driven.
There is a commitment to pay benefits to all who meet the qualifying
conditions. The public spending plans are based on official estimates of the
number of claimants. If the number proves greater than estimated, we have
(in Treasury jargon) an irresistible bid, and spending threatens to rise
above target.
However, total public spending is subject to cash limits. So in theory, when
social security spending rises, other elements in the budget must be cut
back. This actually happened last autumn when, in order to stick to its
spending plans in the face of a near Pounds 3bn increase in the social
security budget, the government had to cut other programmes. That was why
last year's spending settlement was genuinely tough even though total
spending was not reined back.
The inexorable growth of social security is a prime reason why the
government has continually to choose between making swingeing cuts in
important programmes and failing to control spending. Loss of control tends
to happen before elections, with cuts coming afterwards. But for much of the
time, whatever they choose to do, governments are accused by the right of
loss of control and by the left of excessive cuts.
During the recession just ended, which coincided unusually with an election,
irresistible social security bids helped to drive public spending above
target and upwards as a share of GDP. There is nothing unusual about public
spending taking an increasing share of GDP during recessions. That has
always been a consequence of rising unemployment (hence rising social
security payments) and falling output. Over the cycle, the public spending
share should rise in the recession and fall in the boom.
The problem is that, in our political economy, spending never falls by
enough in the boom. So when the irresistible bids push it up in the next
recession, the share of GDP taken by total public spending reaches a higher
level than at the same point in the previous cycle. The deterioration of the
public finances is most evident in recessions, but much of the damage is
done in booms.
That certainly happened in the boom of the late 1980s, when unemployment and
the associated social security payments fell. There are always strong claims
on the public purse, and they ensured that total spending continued to rise,
in nominal terms, as fast as before. This fact was, however, obscured by the
sharp real squeeze on public spending in 1988, when inflation came in 3 per
cent higher than expected.
So what we have is a classic ratchet effect. When public spending on social
security falls, as it does in boom times, other spending rushes in to take
its place. But when spending on social security rises, as it does in
recessions, the effect of this 'irresistible' new spending is to swell the
total. The combination of a target for total public spending and special
status for the 'irresistible' social security bids is lethal.
That is why the 1992 Autumn Statement separated out so-called 'cyclical
social security'. In future booms, the fall in unemployment pay and related
benefits will be scored 'below the line' and will not create space for an
expansion of other public spending programmes.
Unfortunately, there is another and potentially more dangerous ratchet
effect at work in the social security arena. At times when unemployment has
risen most rapidly there has also been a sharp increase in the take-up of
other benefits such as invalidity benefit. A new group of clients becomes
aware of the wide range of benefits available to them. When unemployment
falls in the subsequent recovery, there is no comparable fall in the numbers
receiving other benefits. So the take-up of a wide range of benefits
increases steadily over time.
If we compare the numbers expected to receive benefits this year with the
numbers in 1978-79, just before Mrs (now Lady) Thatcher took office, the
increases are startling. The numbers claiming invalidity benefit have gone
up by nearly 1m, nearly tripling the case load. The numbers claiming
mobility allowance have also risen by nearly 1m, increasing the case load by
a factor of 10. The numbers claiming attendance allowance and one-parent
benefit have also tripled and are approaching 1m in each case.
It would be wrong to conclude from these figures that the 1980s saw a
threefold increase in the numbers of invalids, single parents and those
'requiring frequent attention . . . in connection with their bodily
functions' (the qualifying condition for attendance allowance), or a 10-fold
increase in the numbers unable to walk. Obviously what is going on is that
an increasing proportion of those eligible for these benefits have been
taking them up and/or the criteria for eligibility are being less strictly
applied.
Which brings us to a key feature of the social security budget: not all
those entitled to benefits take them up, but take-up rates are steadily
increasing over time. For some benefits, take-up rates are as low as 65 per
cent.
These simple facts have profound implications. In a sense the government is
committed to a level of support for benefit recipients that it could not
possibly afford if all who were entitled to benefits claimed them. As time
goes by and take-up rates rise, that becomes increasingly apparent. The
increase in take-up rates is now the main factor driving up social security
spending. Take-up rates increase especially rapidly in recessions as new
clients learn their way round the benefit system. Once on they stay on.
Recessions thus accelerate the upward trend in take-up, but booms do not
reverse it.
The government will never get the public finances properly under control
until they find a way of curbing the irresistible upward march of social
security spending. That is why the long-term public spending exercise put in
place by Mr Michael Portillo, the chief secretary to the Treasury, is
vitally important. Radical solutions are needed. I shall look at some of the
options next week.

special adviser to the former chancellor, Mr Norman Lamont.

FT  27 JUL 93 / Fuel to power the future: South-east Asian countries are
increasingly turning to nuclear energy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET and WILLIAM KEELING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JAKARTA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Power cuts are the bane of industrialists in south-east Asia from Manila to
Johor, but visiting executives from companies such as France's Framatome,
Germany's Siemens and Atomic Energy of Canada can be forgiven for smiling
when the lights go out.
South-east Asia's fast-growing economies are increasingly looking to nuclear
power to meet growing demand for electricity, a trend that offers attractive
opportunities to suppliers of western nuclear technology and equipment while
arousing concern among environmentalists.
Indonesia, Thailand and the Philippines have all announced recently that
they are contemplating the development of nuclear power stations, and the
idea has also been discussed in Malaysia.
Their more advanced east Asian neighbours - Japan, Taiwan and South Korea -
already have nuclear power programmes, as does China.
'The Asia-Pacific region has by far the greatest market potential in the
next decade,' said Mr Woodrow Williams, manager of advanced reactor
commercial programmes for GE Nuclear Energy, part of the US power
engineering group, speaking at an FT power conference in Singapore recently.
'We are talking in terms of Dollars 160bn over the next 15 years.'
Taiwan and South Korea are already established markets for nuclear
suppliers, but it may take time and effort to convince other south-east
Asian countries that nuclear energy is cheap enough and safe enough to be
worth pursuing.
'Can the Thai public be sure that a nuclear power plant built and operated
in Thailand will be well managed and attain the safety standard as in
France?' asked Mr Pisit Pakkasem, secretary-general of Thailand's National
Economic and Social Development Board, a state think-tank, in a speech to
Canadian businessmen.
Thailand is unusual in south-east Asia in that its electricity generating
authority has invested enough in conventional power plants to be able to
meet the demand for electricity so far, although that demand has almost
doubled in the past five years.
Thai officials, however, feel they are reaching the limits of what they can
do with non-nuclear power. They believe electricity demand will increase by
10-15 per cent annually in the next decade, equivalent to about 1,000MW a
year.
Thailand is therefore planning to build six nuclear power plants with a
total capacity of some 6,000MW; final approval to go ahead will be needed by
1997 if the first two units are to be commissioned on schedule in 2006.
The authorities acknowledge that public concerns about the risks of nuclear
power, the problems of waste disposal and the potentially high capital costs
will have to be allayed before a final decision is made.
Thai officials have suggested that countries supplying radioactive material
to Thailand may have to take back the spent fuel because the country lacks
storage facilities. 'We can't hide it in the klong (canal),' said Mr Pisit.
Some Thai and foreign conservationists doubt that a bureaucracy incapable of
enforcing basic environmental and safety regulations will be able to
establish a viable supervisory authority for a nuclear power industry, or
make it cost-effective. 'Cost will be the big problem,' said one foreign
energy expert.
Thailand's vocal but ineffective environmental groups recommend gas-fired
power stations or lignite plants fitted with emission treatment systems.
They say Thailand could shave at least 3,000MW from future demand by
promoting energy efficiency.
Mr Witoon Permpongsacharoen, director of the Project for Ecological
Recovery, a lobby group, says government forecasts of a 10-15 per cent rise
in electricity demand over the next few years are too high.
Fewer qualms about public opinion or safety issues appear to be found in
Indonesia, a less open society than Thailand, which has gone further down
the road to nuclear power.
President Suharto backs nuclear energy and has played down the possibility
of an accident: 'With careful planning we should not have to worry too much
about such a risk.'
A 1,200MW nuclear power complex costing an estimated Dollars 2.4bn is
expected to be built at Muria in central Java by 2005. This will be followed
by the gradual installation of a further 5,800MW of nuclear capacity,
despite a complaint from Greenpeace, the environmental lobby group, that
Java's record of seismic activity meant that the country 'could be heading
for another Chernobyl'.
In Malaysia, the atomic energy debate is at an early stage. Last year Mr S
Samy Vellu, the minister responsible for energy, announced that the country
would opt for nuclear power generation and that the first power station
would be on stream within a decade.
Dr Mahathir Mohamad, the prime minister, subsequently contradicted this and
put a stop to any nuclear plans for the time being, saying there was no need
for nuclear energy because the country had plenty of gas, oil, coal and
hydro-electricity.
If anything should discourage south-east Asians from investing in nuclear
power it is the experience of the Philippines. Construction by Westinghouse,
the US power engineering group, of a 620MW, Dollars 2.1bn plant at Bataan
began in 1976. But it was mothballed on completion 10 years later because
the government alleged that Westinghouse and Burns &amp; Roe, the engineering
consultants, had bribed Ferdinand Marcos, the late dictator, to win the
contract. There were also reports that the plant had been built on an
earthquake-prone fault line.
A Philippine inquiry last year concluded that the plant did not lie on a
geological fault, and this year the Philippines lost its US court case
against the American companies, which were found not to have bribed Marcos.
Manila has spent millions of dollars on the case and continues to spend
millions on interest payments for the plant, which lies idle while the main
island of Luzon is subjected to black-outs up to 10 hours long.
Officials say a further Dollars 400m will have to be spent over 30 months to
upgrade the plant to 1992 safety standards, only slightly less than the cost
of a new conventional power station of similar capacity.
The Philippine government seems undeterred by this financial disaster. Last
week President Fidel Ramos ordered his government to prepare a nuclear power
plan by November.
Mr Pablo Malixi, the former chief of the National Power Corporation, the
state-owned utility, said he doubted if either the Indonesians or the Thais
would backtrack on their commitment to nuclear energy. 'It's going to be the
fuel of the future,' he said.

FT  27 JUL 93 / Arts: Balthus - the shock of the old / Art in Switzerland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICIA MORISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Old people are not expected to shock, except by the sobering spectacle of
their own decay. As for an old, world-famous artist, he or she is almost by
definition one who no longer shocks the public. After two generations, the
public feels it knows that artist's work. And yet, our idea of the artist's
work will inevitably be largely ersatz, formed by the publishing industry's
choice of images for coffee-table books, posters, art calendars and
postcards.
Certain artists' work more easily becomes ersatz than others. Lowry is one,
Balthus is another. Balthus is now 85 and his paintings (at least, the most
'Balthusian' of them) have for decades been among the most recognisable of
any artist still living. As for the real thing, however, it is not easily
seen; Balthus is still owned largely by private collectors and not by
museums. How odd, even perverse, then, that the Musee des Beaux-Arts in
Lausanne, Switzerland, has made so little fuss about Balthus, the first
major retrospective since the Paris/New York shows of 1983-4.
The Lausanne museum is honouring Balthus, who has lived in the canton of
Vaud for the past 15 years. Originally, the exhibition was to have focused
on paintings associated with Switzerland, where the artist spent his
childhood and adolescence and the war years from 1940. But Balthus himself
was enthused by the idea, collectors responded generously, and the result is
a major exhibition which moreover looks marvellous. More than 50 paintings,
30 drawings and watercolours are spaciously hung in the lofty white
galleries.
They include a good number of the painter's best-known paintings from the
1930s to 1950s; 'The Street', 'Le Passage du Commerce Saint-Andre', 'The
Children', 'Therese', and 'Les Beaux Jours'. As well as the figure
paintings, there are a fascinating group of the landscapes which are the
less well-known side of Balthus's work.
'The Mountain' (1937) is an extraordinarily declamatory and even crude
painting of a party of young walkers revelling in the panoramic grandeur of
the Alps. They respond with exhilaration to the azure sky, the dizzy views.
But there is also seduction in the heat. One of the two girls is still fast
asleep on the velvet turf, wrapped in a personal solitude which is typically
Balthus.
After the war, landscapes in France and more recently Italy have become
places of timeless enchantment. Tiny figures endowed with the poise of
Gicaometti sculptures herd their cows or call in a white horse from the
orchard. They are lost in a pastoral world of Virgilian perfection. In his
youth, Balthus famously copied the frescoes of Piero della Francesco and
Masacio. His landscapes have the quality of missing fragments from the
background of a fresco.
The warders are on the alert to keep visitors far enough away from Balthus's
surfaces. Already in 'La Victime' of 1937, the paint is thick, mottled,
clotted. The technique of putting layer upon layer of pigment means that
from close up, 'Large landscape with Cows' painted at the Chateau de Chassy
in 1959 is almost like paint cohering to a pile rug. The image floats on the
surface. No reproduction of Balthus's work ever begins to convey this
extraordinary texture.
If the texture of the real thing is a surprise, so too may be the sombreness
of Balthus's palette, especially in the early years. Reproductions tend to
make his work look lighter. Here, the catalogue (not a complete one, by the
way, costing SFr50) is badly at fault. Balthus's colours have become
brighter over the decades, as his famous nudes have become more decorative
and the atmosphere less menacing.
'Young Girl with a Blue Towel' (1958) is an enchantingly pretty painting of
a stocky girl in a bathroom. She is delectably pink and almost herself seems
to radiate light in the brilliance of a summer morning. So far I have
described some of the surprises you may find in the retrospective. What of
the shock of Balthus?
The most recent work in the show, 'Cat and Mirror III', was finished this
summer and is exhibited for the first time. This golden-haired girl on a
couch has an anatomy which is stranger even than the oddest Balthus figures
 -which is saying quite a lot. However, far from being nude like most of her
predecessors, she is fully clad and even rather fashionable, in her luminous
lilac leggings. The couch on which she lies, observed by a tabby cat, is
loaded like a boat with gaudy patterned fabrics.
Were this the only painting by Balthus of a young girl which one had ever
seen, it would be quite mystifying as to why Balthus still has an exotic and
even evil reputation. And yet, it is almost exactly 60 years ago that he
achieved lasting notoriety with his first exhibition in the Galerie Pierre
in Paris. Five large paintings (each 6ft) portrayed situations which were
erotic, even sado-masochistic. The real shocker was 'The Guitar Lesson',
showing a woman teacher sexually assaulting the adolescent girl pupil, bent
across her lap in a clear travesty of a Pieta.
Balthus had found a subject which would never cease to unnerve and even
shock. That particular painting is absent from the show. Even so, there are
a host of young girls, some with long thin limbs like Gothic beauties, some
with rounded limbs and moon faces. For many people, Balthus will for ever be
a dubious artist. They reprehend him for being the classicist who paints a
thoroughly unclassical nude, and more basic still, for being a dirty old man
whose nudes of the '80s show him as still fixated on the Lolita figure.
So yes, Balthus can still be shocking. Indeed, such is the degree of
hysteria in Anglo-Saxon countries about adult exploitation of child
sexuality, it is questionable how many museum directors would feel
comfortable today about staging a retrospective of Balthus, 'Guitar Lesson'
and the rest. In Lausanne they see things differently. The exhibition is
fascinating and full of beautiful images; see it, if you can.
                          *       *       *
If you linger in Lausanne, close by at Martigny the Fondation Pierre
Gianadda is showing Edgar Degas (150 works; open daily, until November 21).
Henry Darger; The Adventures of the Vivian Girls at the Collection de l'art
brut is deranged, distasteful but curious. The collection itself, formed by
Jean Dubuffet, should be seen. The Fondation de l'Hermitage is showing
Claude Monet and His Friends: works loaned from the Musee Marmottan and
private collections (until September 26). Last month, the Museum of the
Olympics opened down by the lake. It is far more ghastly even than I
imagined, but has some interest as a sign of the times.
Balthus runs until 29 August. Sponsors; Nestle SA, Fondation Nestle pour
l'Art, Vevey; MMe. Hentsch, Chollet &amp; Cie.

Thin pickings. BBC1 looks very sad and sorry for itself, like a network that
has lost Pounds 35m and found a bag of used cassettes. Between 8.00 and
10.30 there is nothing but repeats, and even the American programme
beginning at 10.30, Vigilante Cop, may well be another repeat. By billing
this television drama as a 'Film' the BBC, by its own weird rules, avoids
the need to come clean and say whether it really is a repeat or not. So it
probably is.
Ironically one of the network's few original programmes, Bobby Davro: Rock
With Laughter, looks like something dredged up from the 1950s. Davro himself
is a professional enough variety artist, capable of delivering a song and
dance act with impressions thrown in, but the formula (and even the guests:
tonight Neil Sedaka) look as though they have been trapped in a time warp
(7.00).
Nature (8.00 BBC2) investigates British seaside holidays and names the 10
cleanest and 10 dirtiest beaches. In Far Flung Floyd Keith Floyd reports
from Thailand (8.30 BBC2).

FT  27 JUL 93 / Arts: Bayreuth's new Tristan and Isolde inspire optimism -
Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Opening performance at the Bayreuth Festival is still, it seems, the high
point on the German cultural calendar. Eminent visitors are on show: this
year Wolfgang Wagner had as his applause-attracting guests Mikhail and Raisa
Gorbachev; Richard von Weizsacker, the German president, was visible in the
primo palco (so was Douglas Hurd). Crowds were out in force. Protesters, a
bit rain-drenched, were also in attendance, waving banners questioning
expenditure on 'star' opera at a time of belt-tightening for the arts
throughout Germany.
In this Ring-less year - a new one is due in 1994, conducted by James Levine
 -the dominant question inside the theatre before curtain-up was a purely
artistic one, cause among Wagnerians of long months of anticipatory
excitement: would there be revealed to the world important new singers of
Tristan and Isolde?
Almost everything, in fact, was new about this Tristan, apart from the
conductor, Daniel Barenboim (he had been in charge of the previous Bayreuth
production, from 1981 onwards). The controversial former-East-German
playwright Heiner Muller was undertaking his first opera production. Erich
Wonder, an avant-garde designer much prized elsewhere in Germany, was
tackling his first Bayreuth assignment. The Marke, Kurwenal and Brangane
were all new - either to the house or to the opera.
But it was the Tristan, Siegfried Jerusalem, and Isolde, Waltraud Meier  -
native-born Germans both - on whom brightest beams of attention were
trained. Performers of these mightiest of Wagnerian roles capable of
surmounting the peaks and staying the whole course were always in short
supply, even when, unlike today, the finest traditions of Wagner-singing
were as a whole amply nourished and sustained. At least Jerusalem, now in
the mature phase of his career, has approached the opera in careful stages,
via his Bayreuth-germinated Siegmund, Parsifal, Walther and Siegfried: and,
if light by traditional Heldentenor measurements, he has mastered the art of
Wagner pacing.
For Meier the risk was greater, the result even more more lambently
affecting and elating to contemplate. She is still young (late '30s), slimly
handsome, and in voice-type a dramatic mezzo-soprano - a Kundry nonpareil,
Eboli, Delilah. In the history of this opera more than one leading mezzo has
been tempted to 'think herself upwards' into Isolde (Marta Modl and Irene
Dalis come to mind); more often than not, though, strain has shown through,
and a long-term price has had to be paid.
Meier's first Isolde inspires optimism. In this theatre - voice-flattering,
of course, with its covered orchestra and focused acoustics - she could base
it on the most appealing of her artistic characteristics, the floating
across the orchestra of exquisite, legato-based long lines, with notes
precisely sounded and smoothly joined in the classic manner. The voice, with
its highly individual timbre (metal-tipped, liquidly vibrant), sounded not
just beautiful but aptly in character, capable by turns of imperious
flourishes, anger-heated surges, soft romantic raptures.
No Isolde of recent times has bitten into the first exchanges with Tristan
with such tellingly bated sarcasm, made such continuous sense of Wagner's
internal rhyme-schemes - it sounded as though she had lived long with the
character and inside the text before presenting both to the public. Those
famous top notes were all there: not exactly trumpeted, not radiant with
Anne Evans's lighter, easier grace, but never evaded and almost never
forced. I hope Meier will resist calls to make the role her international
calling-card; she needs to continue work on it, patiently and gradually.
To be introduced in a short space to two Isoldes - Meier and Evans - of this
calibre makes this something of a Wagnerian annus mirabilis. Jerusalem's
achievement seems more qualified. Much of the lower-voiced, middle-range
utterance in Act 3 was wonderfully full, rich-grained, with a musicianly
nobility unparalleled in recent times. In extremis, as it were, he tended to
produce volume and notes rather than musical and dramatic sense; now that he
has proved his ability in the first department, the second needs to
recapture all his attention.
A conductor capable of steadier overall command of Wagner's long paragraphs
would undoubtedly have aided him in the process. Barenboim responds strongly
to the beauty of the sound-world - the dullness of his 1981 Tristan is now a
distant memory - but still insufficiently to formal architecture: his
extremes of fast and slow tempo seemed to me ungoverned by the opera's
internal logic.
The other notable stroke of casting was the powerful sensitive young
baritone Falk Struckmann as Kurwenal; John Tomlinson's Marke was unsteady,
too insistent in its expressive detailing, Uta Priew's Brangane sympathetic
but hardly exceptional.
Muller's production, an all-of-a-piece feat of cool, minimalist staging, was
at once abstractly interesting, emotionally distancing (sparing movements,
everything behind gauze), and centrally un-romantic. Wonder's designs
achieved fine Rothko-like patterns and plays of light on curious but always
fastidiously chosen stage properties (the love duet played out amid serried
rows of headless, armless tailor's dummies).
I found it somewhat like a visit to an exhibition of Tristan-related modern
artefacts in a classy German art gallery. Not an unserious experience - the
audience booed it violently - and not a waste of time; but I could not help
feeling the occasion, and particularly the new singers, demanded something
far more engaged.
Performances until August 28.

FT  27 JUL 93 / Arts: From grossness to great charm - Avignon Festival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY CURTIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DURING THE three weeks of the Avignon Summer Festival now in progress the
area by the Papal Palace - the Place du Palais - is best avoided. The
problem is how to avoid it, because the route to get to whatever spectacle
you want to see usually either starts or ends there, so you find yourself
plunging into a jostling mob of tourists in groups, demonstrators, jugglers,
strolling musicians, gruesome-looking mime artists, leaflet-distributors and
all the other hopefuls that pitch camp at this Festival.
At present the Square contains two alien artifacts conspicuous by their
modernity. One is a huge male torso towering above the mob; the other is a
bronze bird sculpted on the same gigantic scale. As the sunlight bounces off
their polished surfaces they seem to be on fire. They are the work of the
Colombian artist Fernando Botero - an exhibition of his work Botero en
Avignon is on view inside the Palace until September 5, after which it will
travel to Moscow and St Petersburg.
Let us go inside, where there are a dozen more Botero bronzes - of nudes,
horses, fruit - and 100 of his paintings, most of them dating from the past
10 years. How consistently Botero has stuck to his great theme - obesity.
Fat kings, fat queens, fat housewives with their fat husbands, fat children
with their fat pets - all are treated with the same stylish detachment as if
they were living dolls, the pale texture of the paint suggesting real flesh
and underlining the roundness and the grossness of the bodily forms.
As one moves from one canvas to the next a magical transformation occurs.
Grossness ceases to seem gross. It acquires, under Botero's witty gaze,
great charm and naturalness. Then, instead of painting a pear-shaped woman
he paints a single pear to the same scale, and we begin to see connections
between human and natural forms.
Exiting from the Palace one encounters a little side street - the rue du
Mons. It is here, tucked away inconspicuously, that the Festival Press
Office is to be found: it is run most efficiently under the direction of Mme
Marie-Helene Arbour. It has a spacious shady garden where every morning
open-air press conferences are held about forthcoming productions.
These offer a pleasantly informal opportunity for the media to question
those artists who are initiating productions at the Festival. French theatre
directors and choreographers tend to be highly articulate in public. None
more so than Jorge Lavelli, who is directing plays here by Steven Berkoff
and Edward Bond. Old hat to us, Bond's work has become a new cult in the
French theatre and his recent play performed here about a murder over a cup
of tea - known in French as Maison d'Arret - is one of the talking-points of
the Festival.
At the end of the rue du Mons we come out on the Place d'Horloge where both
the Theatre Municipal and the Hotel de Ville stand imposingly. This square
tends to be even more impassable during the Festival than the last one as it
is largely occupied by restaurants. But once past we have another safe haven
in which to retreat, the Maison Jean Vilar. This is a fine old Provencal
mansion that has now been made into an excellent museum of theatre and the
performing arts in honour of the founding father of the Festival. It is
currently showing an exhibition of the the stage designs of Georges Pitoeff,
the Russian-born actor-director.
Until his death in 1939 he was a figure of innovative importance in the
Parisian theatre. Among more than 100 premieres of contemporary French and
foreign plays, Pitoeff directed Cocteau's Orphee, Pirandello's Six
Characters and Anouilh's La Sauvage - the play that launched this playwright
in 1938. Pitoeff's production of Shaw's St Joan with his wife Ludmilla in
the title role gave Shaw his greatest success in France.
Mme Pitoeff was a diminutive woman of magical presence on stage, as I can
confirm - I once saw her as Charlotte Bronte. As one studies her husband's
designs for his Shaw production the influence of E. Gordon Craig on Pitoeff
clearly emerges. A video in which some of Pitoeff's colleagues in the
theatre and his son Sacha pay tribute to him accompanies the show.
Cocteau makes the point that all his productions were done on a shoe-string.
He was, says Cocteau, a saint of the theatre. However, there were wags such
as Yvonne Printemps who called the Pitoeffs les pitoyables. In the theatre
even a Pitoeff cannot avoid making enemies. This exhibition leaves one with
a renewed respect for his daring, sensitivity, and genius.

FT  27 JUL 93 / Arts: What's in a name? - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If a family is called Jinx, I suppose you should expect misfortunes. And if
the play is called The Devil's Only Sleeping, it is likely that they will
not be entirely man-made. Nick Stafford's piece at the Cockpit contains
almost everything that a rational person will dislike: transvestism,
violence, a heavy touch of the supernatural and an overriding note of
obscurity. At times it seems like a mixture of 'The Archers' and Thomas
Hardy, though it appears to be set on a small farm in Scotland. Do not be
put off by the background, however: this is a tersely written play. The main
reservation is whether it belongs more properly to television.
There has been a killing in the Jinx family nearly 20 years ago. Barton
Jinx, who was convicted of the crime, emerges from prison to visit Myra,
wife of his twin brother. It was her father who was killed. The husband is
also dead, and buried above the farmstead. There remains a son, Billy, whose
fatherhood is in doubt. Barton begins to settle down alongside Myra in place
of his brother.
What happens in the play is not always clear, nor is it meant to be. An old
Mini is parked on stage throughout. It was driven through Dead Man's Wood at
60 mph on the night that the killing occurred. It is driven through the same
wood now - at 63 mph - by Billy and his girl-friend, Alex. None of the
relationships are normal. Billy gets on well enough with Alex, but is
happiest when dressed as a woman. Alex seems to come from a more
conventional background, but suggests that even her family is under stress,
if not quite jinxed. It is when the surrogate father starts beating Billy
for his transvestism that the Jinx environment falls apart.
It sounds bizarre, but is compelling. Of the cast of four, Sheridan
MacDonald excels as Myra, the woman who always wears trousers, and Billy
McColl as Barton looks as is he is literally carrying the jinx on his
shoulders. Jon Morrison directs with the tightest control. The Cockpit, the
new home of the Soho Theatre Company, looks as if it has already made its
mark on the London fringe.
Cockpit Theatre, NW 8, until August 14. 071-402 5081

FT  27 JUL 93 / Business and the Law: Sweet sound of harmony - Unifying
business law is no simple matter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By A H HERMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
National legislators seldom keep pace with the development of international
business. When they do attempt to address the subject, they often make
things worse by drafting the legislation from a purely domestic view.
Fortunately, a large number of international organisations have made it
their task to harmonise different systems of national business law and to
provide national legislators with guidelines and models for new legislation.
It can take decades before government experts agree a legal text and when
they do, businesses can wait many more years for ratification. Some
organisations try to bypass this bottleneck by drafting standard terms and
guidelines which businessmen can incorporate in their contracts.
However, the number of international organisations generating harmonisation,
unification or new law projects has mushroomed. Excluding the European
Community, which legislates for the benefit of its member countries, this
new legal industry now consists of no less than 28 organisations, some of
them highly specialised.
The United Nations alone has 12 different agencies in the legislative
business. The most prolific of these are Unctad (trade and development),
Uncitral (trade law) and Wipo (intellectual property), while Gatt (tariffs
and trade) is the best known.
There are eight other inter-governmental organisations. The oldest and most
productive is the Rome-based Unidroit, founded in Rome in the 1930s for the
international unification of laws, while the most productive is the
Paris-based Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).
A recent addition is the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development
(EBRD). Although it has not provided the post-communist countries with much
money, it is about to let them have a model law on secured transactions.
Finally, there are eight non-governmental international organisations. Half
of these specialise in transport law: CIT (railways), CMI (marine), IRU
(road) and Fiata, which is a federation of freight forwarders.
Of the remaining four, the Paris-based International Chamber of Commerce
(ICC) has done useful work on abbreviated contract terms, standard terms for
several types of banking operations, and arbitration.
A survey of the current activities of these organisations, produced by
Uncitral on July 1, lists no fewer than 112 projects related to the
harmonisation and unification of international trade law. A sampling of this
mountain of paper shows that there are great variations in its quality,
usefulness and impact.
Work in the field of international transport law has had a great impact on
business, notably in limiting the liability of carriers for damage or loss
of goods. Unfortunately, the law is also rather difficult to understand, and
national courts (of the maritime nations in particular) are often faced with
difficult problems of interpretation.
The most successful, perhaps, is the ICC work on Incoterms, the widely-used
abbreviated contract terms system, while its standard terms for letters of
credit have been adopted by most banks engaged in international business.
Uncitral's work on arbitration rules and model law has profoundly influenced
arbitration worldwide, particularly the English and Scottish jurisdictions
and the Commonwealth. Mr Gerald Herrmann, who steered these projects with
unique enthusiasm, has been since promoted to Secretary General of Uncitral.
By contrast, the other great product of Uncitral, the 1980 UN Convention on
International Contracts for the Sale of Goods (the Vienna Convention), is
only the smallest common denominator of the often conflicting interests of
the countries which for 15 years participated in its drafting.
Its ratification by the UK has been opposed by the English legal profession
for a variety of reasons, one of which is the unjustified fear that it could
open the door to continental lawyers.
More valid objections to the convention are the absence of provisions on
when the title to the sold goods should pass from the seller to the buyer,
and its preference for enforcing specific performance rather than
compensating a breach of contract by damages.
In spite of the fact that the UK has not yet ratified the Vienna Convention,
UK traders may fall into these pitfalls whenever the contract is governed by
the law of a country which has ratified it, as most of its trading partners
have done.
Two ICC projects may help a little. One is concerned with updating the ICC
Guide on the Retention of Title, the other with the drafting of a model
contract which would fit the Vienna Convention.
The ICC published in 1991 a Model Commercial Agency Contract and is about to
publish a Model Distribution Agreement. The amount of duplication and
triplication that exists in this field is illustrated by the existence - in
addition to an EEC directive - of an 1983 (Geneva) Convention and many
valuable studies on commercial agency undertaken, and now suspended, by
Unidroit.
Another Uncitral product, the soon to be published Legal Guide on
International Countertrade Transactions, is a valuable study of problems
arising in different types of barter and buy-back deals, but could be much
improved by bringing these problems in relation to specific national laws.
By providing a readily available model, the EEC harmonisation measures
exercise a powerful influence on the international unification of law,
sometimes infecting it with integrationist tendencies which are far ahead of
the political readiness to accept them.
Such seems to be the case of the Uncitral Draft Model Law on Procurement.
Its Article 3 provides for equal opportunity and equal treatment of foreign
participants in public tenders. This desirable objective is not yet
acceptable to many countries where preference for domestic suppliers is well
established by practice and legislation.
A model law, though it must not be too much ahead of what is politically
possible, will be widely used only if it represents an advance on the
legislation already in place.
The Uncitral Draft Model Law on Procurement seems to follow the outmoded
method of prescribing procedure instead of clearly stating economic aims. It
has been criticised, by Australia for example, for its resulting lack of
flexibility and for a narrow emphasis on price, instead of value for money,
as the main criterion for evaluation of offers.
Although it deals with social security obligations, the draft is silent on
environmental conditions, health and safety, wages and working conditions. A
further weakness is that its provisions for administrative and judicial
review of awards have been rejected by Japan, probably because judicial
review there might easily take 10 years.
One should not draw too many general conclusions from a small sample of work
which, even if not perfect, results from devoted efforts of many
well-informed lawyers and is indispensable for the development of
international trade law; except, perhaps, that there is a need for
unification of the unification process and for a greater support of private
efforts, which can bring quicker and better results than negotiations
between governments.

FT  27 JUL 93 / People: UK Tec adviser returns to US
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The wheel has come full circle. Cay Stratton, who brought her US experience
in training and community regeneration to the UK nearly six years ago, and
who has been one of the lead architects of radical changes in the delivery
of training in the UK, is returning to the US to advise President Clinton's
administration on the same issues.
Stratton, who has been policy adviser to three successive secretaries of
state for employment in the UK, takes up her new post, as senior policy
adviser to Douglas Ross, assistant secretary at the Department of Labor, in
September.
A graduate of Stamford University, she has spent her career in the fields of
education, training and community economic development. It is a role to
which one of her employers says she has brought 'bags of go, a great deal of
authority and a remarkable ability to bridge the very different worlds of
the private and public sectors'.
In the late 1980s Stratton was chief executive of the Boston Pic. Private
Industry Councils are employer-led organisations which involve the private
sector in education and training. Norman Fowler, the then employment
secretary, met her on an educational visit to learn about Pics and US
vocational training and in 1987 she accepted a one-year post as his special
adviser. She has stayed nearly six, also advising his successors, Michael
Howard and Gillian Shephard.
Stratton was part of a small team, headed by Sir Geoffrey Holland, the
department's former permanent secretary, which laid the foundations for the
government's current policies on training.
These include Training and Enterprise Councils. Stratton was keen that Tecs
should learn from Pics' experience - notably by insisting that Tecs'
directors were senior executives with high local profiles. In the US the
seniority of directors on Pics' boards was allowed to fall; Pics' clout
locally also fell.
Stratton, who regularly works a 70-hour week, should also be credited with
arguing that enterprise activities should be bound closely into Tecs. One
former senior DoE official says: 'I doubt we would have had the same
emphasis on enterprise within Tecs without Cay.'
Nor has she been an easy taskmaster. The official adds: 'She has banged away
at the performance of Tecs in a way that has been uncomfortable for some of
them.'

FT  27 JUL 93 / People: Nigel Lester - global role at UBS
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Nigel Lester, who resigned as chief executive of County NatWest Investment
Management (CNIM) earlier this year, is joining UBS as global head of
research next month.
UBS's research operation has been through a rough patch, with the firing of
Terry Smith, former head of UK equity research, last autumn, and a steady
stream of defections.
Nick Bannister, managing director and head of equity sales, says that it is
appropriate that someone from the fund management side be brought aboard to
further 'the determined effort to see our research product from our clients'
point of view'. UBS slipped to sixth from fourth position in this year's
Extel rankings of City research departments.
Lester, 40, steps into a new position, combining responsibility for
improving equity research in London, Zurich, Paris and Frankfurt with a
broader role of co-ordinating the Swiss group's equity and bond research on
a worldwide basis. Hector Sants, vice chairman and head of equities, had
been filling in as head of research since last autumn.
A qualified actuary, Lester started out in the actuarial department of Legal
&amp; General, and 'got into fund management as quickly as possible'. He then
spent seven years in Hong Kong, first with Schroders, later setting up
Aetna's operations in the Far East. He went back to the US insurance giant's
headquarters for a year, but returned to London after a year because he
found Connecticut 'a little boring'.
He says he had already more or less decided to leave CNIM, which has lost a
lot of people on the fund management side, before Christmas. 'I normally
like working 12-hour days, but the fun had gone out of it,' he says. Asked
whether he was not a little intimidated by some of the big egos already well
established at UBS who would now be reporting to him, he replied: 'I got
some good experience at County.'

<TEXT>
The US Supreme Court has failed to clarify when punitive damages awards are
excessive. A divided court recently upheld by 6 votes to 3, the
constitutionality of a Dollars 10m punitive damages award made by a West
Virginia court that was more than 500 times greater than the Dollars 19,000
compensatory damages it awarded to TXO Production Corp, a subsidiary of the
US steel, oil and gas giant USX Corp, for slander of title in a dispute over
rights to oil and gas beneath a tract of land. The court reiterated its
reasoning in a 1991 case that punitive damages must be reasonable within the
context of the case, but failed to spell out what would be regarded as
unreasonable.

FT  27 JUL 93 / Business and the Law: Judicial scheme to offer private
appraisal - Legal Briefs
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK's Centre for Dispute Resolution, an industry-backed non-profit making
organisation set up in 1990 to promote alternative dispute resolution (ADR),
has launched a judicial appraisal scheme which will offer businesses a new
private judging service. The scheme offers a 'fast track' method by which
potential litigants can seek an independent assessment of their case from
senior lawyers drawn from a panel of experienced barristers and former High
Court judges. Parties can then choose to negotiate a settlement or opt for
mediation. Users of the scheme can agree to treat the assessment as binding.
Alternatively, they can use it as a means of narrowing down the issues for
future trial. The costs of using the scheme will range from Pounds 750 a
day, depending on the value of the claim. Similar techniques have been used
in the US under names such as Rent-A-Judge or Judicial Arbitration &amp;
Mediation Services, which fields 200 former US judges.

FT  27 JUL 93 / Business and the Law: Banana move dismissed - European Court
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRICK COURT CHAMBERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Court recently dismissed an application by the German government for interim
suspension of the European Council's new regulation on the common
organisation of the Community banana market (see FT, July 6 1993).
Germany brought the interim measures application in the context of its
application for judicial review of the new rules governing trade in bananas
with non-Community countries. The main case challenging the banana
regulation continues on its way through the Court.
In parallel to the German case, banana companies - including Chiquita, Dole
and Pacific Fruit, as well as banana importers, such as Anton Durbeck Gmbh
and International Fruchtimport Gesellschaft Weichert &amp; Co - brought
applications for judicial review of the banana regulation and for interim
measures.
Some also claimed damages against the Community, represented by the Council
and Commission, for losses they say they will suffer under the new banana
regime.
The banana regulation imposes a tariff-quota of 2m tonnes for bananas from
non-traditional African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries and third
countries. These are distinguished from ACP bananas traditionally given
preferential treatment under the Lome Conventions in France, Italy and the
UK and which have duty- and quota-free access to the Community. Bananas
given preferential treatment under Lome Conventions are mainly dollar-area
bananas grown in central and south America. Within the quota, both
categories are liable to a duty of Ecu100 (Pounds 75) per tonne. Outside the
quota, bananas from the non-traditional ACP are subject to a duty of Ecu750
and those imported from other third countries Ecu850.
The regulation also allocates the tariff-quota among commercial operators.
From July 1 1993, the regulation restricts 30 per cent of the quota to
operators that have traded in Community and/or traditional ACP bananas which
are not themselves subject to any quota.
This leaves only 66.5 per cent of the quota to operators which have traded
in non-traditional ACP and/or third country bananas. Only 3.5 per cent
remains available to operators which entered the market as new entrants
since 1992.
The ECJ decided on its own initiative to consider whether the private
companies had standing to seek judicial review.
In a number of orders recently made publicly available, the Court dismissed
all applications for judicial review on the grounds that the private
companies could not show that they had sufficient standing, since they were
not individually concerned by the regulation which was a legislative act of
general application. They were affected only as members of the general class
of economic operators to which the regulation applied.
The applicants, therefore, failed to show that their legal interests were
affected in a way that distinguished them from others individually as if the
regulation had been addressed to them.
On July 6, the Court president dismissed all interim applications by the
banana companies on the grounds that the interim measures were linked to the
main judicial review proceedings, which were inadmissible.
The ECJ said that the question of the standing of the private companies
claiming damages was unaffected by the inadmissibility of the judicial
review proceedings. It confirmed previous decisions that damages claims are
separate and independent actions.
Consequently, the damages cases brought by certain companies claiming
compensation for the damage caused by the adoption of the banana regulation
will continue on their way through the Court just as the judicial review
proceedings brought by Germany.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Shandwick, the international public relations company, has announced that
Peter Gummer is splitting the role of chairman and chief executive with
effect from next April's agm; with Dermot McNulty, chief operating officer,
stepping up into the chief executive's seat.
McNulty, 44, spent 15 years with Burson-Marsteller before joining Shandwick
in New York in 1989. He moved to the UK the following year, initially as
director of international marketing.
He says the move means he will be 'responsible for a great number of
important but routine things, leaving Gummer, who is accorded 'guru status'
in worldwide public relations circles', more time for marketing and business
development.
Meanwhile, 62-year-old Len Kingshott is joining the board as a non-executive
director. He stepped down from his position as deputy chief executive of
Lloyds Bank International in 1989; since then he has held a number of
positions, including the chairmanship of Rosehaugh, the property group now
in receivership. Kingshott had also been lined up to head the European end
of BCCI under a planned reconstruction of the group shortly before the Bank
of England moved in to shut down the entire operation.

FT  27 JUL 93 / Technology: Ways to break a vicious circle / A look at
advances in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, in a series on drug
discoveries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CREAKING joints and early morning stiffness have traditionally been seen as
a normal part of the ageing process. The condition is often painfully
crippling but difficult to avoid. However, another form of arthritis, known
as rheumatoid arthritis, is more insidious. The disease, which afflicts one
in 100 people, can strike at any age and torments women twice as often as
men. Its onset is normally in the 20s and 30s, although children can be also
affected.
The condition is both debilitating and life-threatening. Recent studies
suggest that not only quality of life is impaired, as sufferers struggle to
live normal lives with increasingly crippled joints, but life-expectancy is
reduced by an average of six years.
Scientists are still trying to find the cause. They are confident, however,
that there is a genetic component which predisposes people to the illness. A
particular sequence of genes is found in about 80 per cent of patients with
rheumatoid arthritis, explains Bruce Littman, director of clinical medicine
at the central research facility of Pfizer, the US drugs group.
This genetic sequence appears to be insufficient to cause rheumatoid
arthritis on its own. There are probably also environmental factors, which
may be linked to a single bacteria or virus, or a combination of organisms,
says Littman.
The exact effect of the organisms and the genetic predisposition remain
unclear. However, the result is that they trigger an inappropriate response
from the body's immune system to the joints' tissues.
One theory is that the external organism may cause alterations to the cells
in the joint, which are then viewed by the immune system as foreign
material, says Beat von Graffenried, project leader for immunology at the
research and development department at Sandoz of Switzerland. Once the
immune system has identified the cells as foreign material, the system
erroneously views them as an attack, and launches a counter-offensive.
During a normal infection, the immune system identifies an antigen or
foreign body and reacts by generating cytokines. These help activate the
immune system and trigger the production of chemicals that create
inflammation. This gives the body's defences access to the infectious
material.
Normally, once the infection has been defeated the system shuts down.
However, in rheumatoid arthritis, for reasons that remain obscure, this
fails to occur. The result is that 'the immune system goes wild and just
won't stop attacking the joint,' says Littman.
A vicious circle is created. The body continues to manufacture the
cytokines, which prove highly toxic to the joint's cells, destroying their
structure. As the cells disintegrate, the immune system identifies the
newly-damaged cells as foreign bodies, and reacts by renewing the attack.
One of the main targets for the renegade immune system is the joint lining,
which becomes inflamed and swollen. In addition, the fluid that lubricates
the joint made by the lining accumulates, adding to the swelling and the
pain.
Traditionally, the first-line therapy for rheumatoid arthritis is a class of
medicines called non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or Nsaids.
Datamonitor, the London-based market research company, estimates that in
1991 these drugs generated sales of Dollars 4.3bn (Pounds 2.9bn).
The market for Nsaids is static because of the recent expiry of the US
patents of one of the most successful Nsaids, a drug called Feldene,
manufactured by Pfizer. Those for the best-selling product in the US, a
treatment from Syntex of California called Naprosyn, expire in December. The
world's top-selling Nsaid is Voltaren, marketed by Ciba of Switzerland,
which generated sales last year of SFr1.63bn (Pounds 700m) in 1992.
Nsaids are from the same class of drugs as aspirin. They work by inhibiting
the production of cyclo-oxygenase, an enzyme that helps in the production of
prostaglandins which increase blood flow and cause inflammation.
Unfortunately, although Nsaids reduce the symptoms of both inflammation and
pain, they have no impact on the production of cytokines and do nothing to
reduce the self-destruction process. They also have severe gastro-intestinal
side-effects and can cause stomach ulcers in prolonged use.
Traditionally, when Nsaids are no longer enough to contain the disease,
physicians turn to second-line therapies. These include treatments such as
gold, D-penicillamine and sulphur celamite.
Among the gold treatments is Ridaura, developed by SmithKline Beecham, the
Anglo-American healthcare group. The company has proven Ridaura's
effectiveness, but it is still unsure how it actually works. Some patients
react badly to gold treatment. However, since most of these drugs are no
longer protected by patents, little is being invested in developing them
further.
The final line of defence has normally been disease-modifying anti-rheumatic
drugs (Dmards). These include Pfizer's recently-launched Tenidap, Sandimmune
from Sandoz, and Rheumatrex, a treatment developed by American Cyanamid's
drugs division, Lederle. Tenidap works in two ways, according to Littman at
Pfizer. First, like the Nsaids, it controls the production of
cyclo-oxygenase. Second, it affects the production of several cytokines.
Sandimmune is an immunosuppressant, originally developed to prevent the
rejection of organs after transplants. It works by blocking the secretion of
chemicals which are responsible for activating the immune system. For
rheumatoid arthritis patients, it is used at low doses, although there is
concern that it could suppress the immune system to the extent that patients
develop opportunistic infections or even cancer. There is presently no
evidence to support such fears.
Lederle's Rheumatrex is actually an anti-cancer drug. It suppresses the
production of white blood cells responsible for the immune response.
However, the traditional progression of therapy from Nsaids to secondary
therapies and finally Dmards is now being challenged. Drug groups such as
Sandoz and Pfizer now maintain that Dmards should be used early in therapy
in an effort to control the disease's progression.
'Sandimmune may be far more effective if taken at the start of the disease
than later on when damage is already considerable,' says von Graffenried.
Sandoz is presently conducting trials to determine if this is the case.
The key to early treatment is identifying the disease early. Many patients
fail to go to their doctor until the disease is well-developed. However,
specialists now believe it should be possible to monitor patients with a
family history of the disease by measuring chemicals called acute phase
proteins, which are an indicator of excessive cytokine activity.
Drug groups are developing a number of leads for the next generation of
treatments. 'There's no point creating new drugs developed on the old lines.
There are enough Nsaids around. We must keep looking at compounds that
influence the development of the disease,' says von Graffenried.
Centocor, the US biotechnology group, is developing a treatment using
monoclonal antibodies, which would inhibit the functioning of certain parts
of the immune system. A number of companies are also developing drugs that
will work against a peptide called substance P, that helps the action of
cytokines. Celltech, a small British biotechnology group, is looking at ways
of inhibiting the action of one particular cytokine, known as Tumour
Necrosis Factor Alpha.
Another approach, according to von Graffenried, is to identify the virus or
bacteria that causes the original problem and then find a way of preventing
it triggering the cycle of self-destruction. 'That's the dream, but it won't
be easy,' he says.
Others are trying to find a way of treating people with the genetic
predisposition to develop rheumatoid arthritis. Von Graffenried says: 'The
biggest dream is genetic therapy. There's clearly a strong genetic link. We
need to find the gene that makes people susceptible to the disease and then
see if we can rectify it. I have some reservations about the practicality of
developing such a therapy, but conceptually it's attractive.'
The series continues next month by looking at the latest advances in
epilepsy treatment.

FT  27 JUL 93 / Technology: Making friends with Big Blue - Alan Cane advises
how to get the best out of an IBM partnership
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
International Business Machines today depends on a diversity of 'business
partners', small and entrepreneurial companies which provide the giant
manufacturer with specialised products and services. There are already more
than 20,000 of them and the total is growing daily. If they withdrew their
co-operation simultaneously, Big Blue's Dollars 60bn (Pounds 40bn) plus
global revenues would fall by at least 40 per cent.
Despite IBM's troubles - it has not made a profit for the past two years,
during which time a fifth of the workforce has left the organisation - it is
still a magnet for smaller companies anxious to sell to its customers and
benefit from its marketing muscle.
Partnering IBM in the mid-1990s* was written for these companies. Its
author, Michael Hillier, is optimistic that IBM will come through its
present troubles and its business partners will benefit from its recovery.
'IBM is still a very large and complex organisation with massive financial
and intellectual assets. It is still a dynamic corporate giant and should
not be underestimated,' he writes.
The problem for would-be IBM partners, as he sees it, is to get the best out
of a decidedly testing relationship without being suffocated by Big Blue.
Not all partnerships with IBM are successful. A broad agreement with the
troubled Wang Laboratories failed after the smaller company apparently
failed to meet sales targets set by IBM. 'How can you try to ensure that
your partnership with IBM is not to be in the 'unsuccessful' percentage,'
Hillier writes. 'The key for most IBM business partners will be to identify
and understand IBM expectations of them and to identify and manage the risks
attached to these expectations.'
It helps to understand IBM's strategy for the future. The company is
shifting focus from hardware to software and services. It will need partners
to help it focus its efforts in markets which may be unfamiliar. A
restraining force may be that IBM will want sole ownership of some areas -
consultancy is a prime example - which in the past it would have been
prepared to share.
How should a potential partner optimise this strategy for its own benefit?
'Ensure IBM understands your product offering and agrees that it meets or
adds value to a known IBM requirement,' Hillier suggests. He does not
underestimate the difficulty of dealing with a company as large as IBM.
Partnerships can fail even after a seemingly satisfactory agreement has been
signed. The reasons are that in the end the potential partner is dealing
with people rather than a corporation.
There may be a failure of communication; IBM's culture has produced a set of
internal manners, language and jargon which can be hard to understand.
Discussions may be 'coded' because IBM has been used to negotiating only
with itself.
A second problem may be IBM's downsizing. Some 43,000 employees left the
company in 1992 and there is no suggestion the exodus is at an end. Hillier
warns: 'Ask yourself if the IBM employee or executive with whom you are
negotiating will be there next week?' Equally, an IBM employee in a new job
may lack the confidence and experience to take full responsibility for the
negotiations.
Finally, there may be a lack of trust between the potential partners.
Culture clash or misunderstanding? It is important to find out quickly; IBM
managers fight their corners hard but give full support once a decision is
made.
The advantages of becoming an IBM partner outweigh the risks, Hillier
concludes. 'IBM will still be present in some form in the foreseeable future
. . . it will almost certainly continue to be increasingly dependent on its
partners to bring in a larger percentage of its business. This dependence
should continue for as far as the eye can see'.

FT  27 JUL 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Large supply of
short-term plans - In a Nutshell
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Only 54 per cent of small business owners draw up a formal business plan
when they start up, according to a survey by Barclays Bank's Business
Planning Bulletin.*
The most common reason for preparing a plan was to obtain bank finance,
mentioned by 36 per cent; to formalise ideas (34 per cent) and assess the
viability of their venture (24 per cent). Only 19 per cent used it to
monitor their progress.
Businesses which did plan ahead still took a short-term view. Twenty-three
per cent planned one year ahead and 5 per cent planned two years ahead. But
61 per cent planned only one month ahead, or even less.

FT  27 JUL 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Acknowledging the growth
factor - In a Nutshell
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A total of 11,600 companies with a combined turnover of Pounds 17.8bn make
use of factoring and invoice discounting in the UK, according to a new
survey.*
But the potential market may be as much as 10 times as big, according to
Michael Bickers, a financial adviser. There are 36 active factoring
companies and three which are financing existing clients but no longer
taking on new business.
The industry continues to be dominated by the 11 members of the Association
of British Factors and Discounters which represent 90 per cent of the total.
Members of the Association of Invoice Factors account for just under 2 per
cent and non-association factors for more than 8 per cent.

FT  27 JUL 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Wake-up call for rollover
relief - In a Nutshell
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Capital gains tax rollover relief granted to entrepreneurs in the last UK
Budget has been extended to take in shareholders in quoted companies as well
as those with shares in private businesses.
Before the last Budget, tax reliefs had been available to passive investors
in private companies but not to the managers.
The British Venture Capital Association felt this still discriminated
against entrepreneurs who had taken their companies to the stock market, and
lobbied further. An amendment to the Finance Bill, expected to become law
shortly, extends relief 'to gains arising from the sale of quoted shares
where the qualifying entrepreneur held the shares when they were unquoted'.

Wealthy private investors - business angels - might be persuaded to back
small firms if only there were some way of bringing the two together. This
is the thinking behind a feasibility study which is being undertaken by
National Westminster Bank to see if a national database of angels could be
set up. The bank is carrying out a pilot study in the north-west of England
and the Thames valley to see how much time and money investors would be
prepared to commit to small firms.

FT  27 JUL 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Falling down on health
and safety - In a Nutshell
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Three-quarters of British companies are failing to comply with new health
and safety legislation six months after it came into force, a survey by the
Eagle Star insurance group showed.
The survey of health and safety managers from 185 companies - one-third
employing fewer than 100 people - revealed that only 23 per cent had fully
implemented the changes, which covered areas such as the use of visual
display screens and the manual handling of loads. And 44 per cent of
companies had yet to comply with the Control of Substances Hazardous to
Health regulations, which came into effect in 1989, Eagle Star said.

FT  27 JUL 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Coping with recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Managing the upturn could prove just as demanding as surviving the
recession. Businesses frequently run into cash-flow problems when orders
increase.
London accountants Blick Rothenberg suggest a 10-point programme for
managing recovery.
Do not try to increase turnover before strengthening your financial
position. Speak to your bank manager to ensure that you have adequate
facilities. If the bank will not help, consider alternatives such as
factoring.
Carry out credit checks on your customers. If they become overstretched they
may pull you down with them. Review credit limits; use a commercial credit
rating agency; chase overdue accounts.
Draw up cash-flow plans based on different levels of future sales so that
you can see the implications.
Be careful about new spending. It may be worth paying comparatively high
charges on a short-term lease of a piece of plant in case you need to cancel
quickly.
Do not be tempted to buy expensive plant, using the 40 per cent first-year
tax allowances available until October 1993, unless you had intended to
purchase it anyway.
The cash-flow benefits could take up to 21 months to come through and you
may anyway have 'tax losses' available as a result of the recession.
Keep staff levels low and use temporary workers where possible.
Review payroll costs each week or month.
Monitor the key financial numbers such as order book, sales and debtors each
week. Do the same for your stock levels, purchases, creditors and bank
balance. Keep a regularly updated three- to four-month cash-flow projection
on your desk.
Most businesses do not need to prepare profit and loss accounts more than
once a quarter.
Save time and money by reducing needless paperwork. The weekly information
described above will be sufficient.
When you have dealt with these immediate issues, draw up a three- or
four-year business plan.

FT  27 JUL 93 / Management (The Growing Business): New rules for old
agreements - Deals between companies and their agents will be subject to new
EC legislation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Louise Harvey, sales manager of Wren Giftware, says she usually seals the
signing up of a new agent with a handshake and a brief letter of
confirmation. Normally, the only points of detail to be agreed are the
territory to be covered and the level of commission.
From January 1, when new European Community-inspired legislation comes into
force in the UK, she will have to take a lot more care in drawing up agency
agreements. Wren, based in Stoke on Trent, employs 40 people making fine
bone china coffee mugs. It has turnover of Pounds 1.3m and uses seven agents
in the UK and three elsewhere in Europe.
On that date, the UK and Ireland will join the rest of the Community in
applying far more detailed rules governing agreements between companies
(principals) and their agents. The new regulations apply not just to agents
in other EC countries but also to those in the principal's home country.
They do not apply to agents outside the EC.
The new rules borrow heavily from legislation in Germany, where agents have
been able to use their contracts as security for loans and where
considerable compensation is available if an agreement is terminated. The
result will be to strengthen the legal position of agents and give them a
far greater degree of security.
The new rules increase the responsibilities of companies using agents as
well as the financial consequences of mishandling the relationship.
'This is a very significant change,' says Ian Campbell, director-general of
the Institute of Export. 'It is a move from a freely negotiated arrangement
between two willing parties to a structure where the rules are set in law.'
Previously the two sides could agree terms between them, subject to the
rules of common law, and if a dispute went to law each case was decided on
its own merits. Under the new rules the rights and duties of both sides are
specified more precisely. They cannot be written out of contracts.
Since agents provide a relatively trouble-free means of expanding into new
geographical markets, the new rules have caused considerable concern among
many businesses and their trade associations.
Two seminars arranged by the Giftware Association to explain the new rules
attracted more than 600 people, says Isabel Jones, association secretary.
'The change-over will cause problems, especially in our industry, where the
companies are quite small,' she says. 'But if people handle it correctly,
the new rules should only amount to good business practice.'
The precise form the new rules will take has still to be finalised and the
Department of Trade and Industry has only just finished consulting
businesses about its second draft of the commercial agents regulations. The
final text will be decided in the next few months.
Uncertainty about their impact is reflected by the fact that there has been
little response to the department's request for views on the likely cost of
compliance.
Businesses must review their current arrangements and if necessary replace
them with more suitable ones before the new regulations come into force,
solicitors Fox Williams advise in an explanatory booklet.*
The main changes to occur are:
Agents will have the right to commission on sales completed within a
reasonable time after the agency contract has been ended, when the
transaction was mainly the result of the agent's efforts.
The new regulations do not set a period during which commission can be
claimed so it makes sense to agree a period in the contract to avoid
disputes, Fox Williams suggest. At present most companies have very vague
arrangements.
Principals will no longer be able to delay paying their agents merely
because they have not yet been paid.
Precise new rules have been drawn up to cover the termination of contracts.
Either party must give written notice of not less than one month in the
first year, two months in the second year and three months in the third and
subsequent years.
The two sides may agree longer periods but the principal may not set himself
a shorter period than applies to the agent.
Provided the agent has not breached the terms of his contract, companies
become liable to pay compensation to their agent to cover losses and costs
resulting from the termination of the contract.
Compensation must take into account the commission the agent might have
earned and costs and expenses which he has not been able to recover.
'It will not be so easy to close down an agreement on a non-performing
agent,' comments Martin Egan, head of the Essex Export Agency, a
consultancy.
'It could make it difficult dealing with a lazy or unscrupulous agent,'
notes Hazle Boyles of Hazle Ceramics, a Brentwood, Essex-based manufacturer
of 'collectibles' with Pounds 250,000 of sales. 'You could end up paying
double if you take on a new agent.'
A danger for the smaller company is that the more formal framework may
prompt an increase in the number of legal disputes. Small firms may be
unable or unwilling to meet these costs, so they must be careful in their
choice of agents and in the way they draw up agreements, the experts advise.
The Giftware Association has commissioned a model agreement from its lawyers
to help its members but principals may still need to consult a lawyer.
'Companies will have to become more professional in drawing up contracts,'
says Campbell. 'Too often export decisions are left to junior staff. Senior
management is happy until something goes wrong. This is an area of risk
management to which companies will have to pay more attention.'

FT  27 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Maastricht challenge opens in High
Court
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LORD Rees-Mogg's attempt to block ratification of the Maastricht treaty was
launched in the High Court yesterday.
The former editor of The Times was in court to hear his counsel, Mr David
Pannick QC, accuse the government of acting unlawfully by seeking to ratify
the treaty without parliamentary approval.
Mr Pannick moved to reassure the court that the case did not pose a threat
to the rights and privileges of the Houses of Parliament. Last week Miss
Betty Boothroyd, the Speaker of the Commons, warned the courts not to
interfere in parliamentary proceedings.
Mr Pannick said: 'These proceedings in our submission do not involve any
questioning of proceedings in the Houses of Parliament contrary to article
nine of the Bill of Rights 1688.'
He told a packed courtroom that the case was not concerned with the merits
of the UK's decision to sign the treaty nor with the wisdom - or folly - of
the UK's intention to ratify it. The proceedings were solely concerned with
the legality of the government's proposed course of action.
The essence of the case was that 'contrary to the requirements laid down by
parliament itself in the 1972 European Communities Act and the 1978 European
Parliamentary Elections Act, the Crown, through the government, intends,
without the authorisation of parliament, to increase the powers of the
European parliament to alter the content of Community law'.
Mr Pannick said the government was acting unlawfully in three respects:
It intended to increase the powers of the European parliament by ratifying
the protocol on social policy.
Without parliamentary authority it intended to alter the content of the
Treaty of Rome by ratifying the protocol on social policy.
Without parliamentary authority it intended to ratify title V of the Treaty
on European Union which deals with a common foreign and security policy
which would transfer prerogative powers away from the UK.
Mr Sydney Kentridge QC for Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, said that
Lord Rees-Mogg's case was based on 'fundamental constitutional
misconceptions' and amounted to an attack on parliament.
Considered as a whole, he said he regarded 'with some scepticism' Mr
Pannick's disclaimer that the challenge had nothing to do with the merits or
demerits of the decision to ratify the treaty.
Rejecting Lord Rees-Mogg's assertion that his aim was not to interfere with
political debate in parliament, Mr Kentridge suggested that 'sometimes
judicial review may be the continuation of politics by other means'.
He said: 'We were told that the government's decision was an attempt by the
Crown to reassert powers which had been lost to them at the end of the 17th
century. 'We submit it is nothing of the sort. There is no conflict at all
between the Crown and Parliament.'
The hearing is expected to last until tomorrow.

FT  27 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Clarke pledge to maintain tax
relief on mortgages
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR KENNETH Clarke, the chancellor, has given a new commitment that the
government will maintain mortgage tax relief.
His statement came in the Treasury response to a cross-party committee
report which said that ministers were phasing out the tax relief 'by
stealth' through limiting its value and coverage.
The response rejected the invitation from the Treasury committee of MPs to
state explicitly the policy of gradually reducing mortgage tax relief,
explaining instead that the purpose of the changes had been 'to improve the
targetting of the relief and contain its substantial costs to the
Exchequer'.
The Treasury said: 'Some 10m borrowers continue to benefit from mortgage
interest relief, the largest number ever. The government intends to maintain
mortgage tax relief.'
Relief will be restricted to the 20 per cent tax rate from 1994-95, under
proposals made in the March Budget this year, following its restriction to
the basic rate in 1991.
Tory rightwingers have long argued for the abolition of the tax relief,
which is estimated to cost the Exchequer Pounds 4.3bn in 1993-94, but its
continued existence has been protected because its removal would be so
unpopular.
The need to tackle public borrowing had raised speculation that the scale of
the relief might be cut further in the November Budget - perhaps by
time-limiting it or making it available to first-time buyers only. Mr
Clarke's commitment appeared to rule that out.
Mr Clarke gave a rough response to the general part of the committee's
analysis, which was the result of an ambush by opposition MPs during
discussion of the draft report.
He described it as a 'garbled and inaccurate criticism of the Budget and the
government's economic record . . . They are a peculiar introduction to a
select committee report and the government does not propose to respond to
them'.

FT  27 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Tory hopes fade over by-election
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TORIES seem to have all but thrown in the towel for the Christchurch
by-election as their campaign moves falteringly into the final days.
None of the party's crowd-pullers is scheduled to appear in a last-ditch
effort to persuade traditional supporters in the south coast constituency to
turn back to the Tories.
Mr William Waldegrave, the public services minister, is due in Christchurch
this morning but tomorrow the Tories' campaign will be left to Sir Norman
Fowler, the party chairman, making his customary eve-of-poll appearance.
The arrangements for rallies by the three main parties last night added to
the impression that the Tories have no real hope for the seat. The Liberal
Democrats, who are tipped to score a resounding victory, fielded Mr Paddy
Ashdown, the party leader; Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, turned
out for Labour, while Sir Edward Heath, the former prime minister, spoke at
the Tories' public meeting.
Sir Edward has recently fuelled the row over Europe within the Conservative
party by outspoken attacks on the Euro-sceptics, and it appears to have been
the local constituency association, rather than central office, that thought
it would be helpful to make use of his offer to assist the campaign.
Both the Tories and the Liberal Democrats were, however, playing down
constituency opinion polls which suggested that the Tory majority of 23,000
would be convincingly overturned.
Mrs Diana Maddock, the Liberal Democrat, thought it was 'doubtful' that the
current state of opinion was as good for her party as the polls suggested.
There were, she said, still 'an awful lot of Conservatives' who were
undecided.
Labour yesterday claimed that the Liberal Democrats were home and dry, and
so Labour supporters did not have to vote tactically to ensure the
Conservatives lost.
Mr Robert Hayward, the Tory candidate, said one-off constituency polls were
inaccurate.
'There are a large number of waverers and we are targeting them to achieve
victory on Thursday,' he said.

FT  27 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Wealthy backers share high cost of
going to law
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM KING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JUDICIAL REVIEW of the Maastricht treaty's ratification does not come cheap.
Lord Rees-Mogg has been able to bring his application to the High Court only
because he has financial backing from wealthy opponents of the treaty,
particularly Sir James Goldsmith.
This week's High Court hearing will cost tens of thousands of pounds a day,
with the final cost of the case multiplying if, as expected, it goes on to
the Court of Appeal.
Mr Jeremy Nieboer, a senior partner at solicitors Gouldens which is handling
the case, said a limit had been set for the cost of the case.
Lord Rees-Mogg's case was put by Mr David Pannick QC, yesterday, supported
by three other barristers. Normal charges for top barristers taking the
brief would suggest fees of Pounds 25,000, with further charges amounting to
Pounds 3,750 for each day of the hearing.
Putting the case for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office is Mr Sydney
Kentridge QC, supported by three other barristers. This is likely to cost a
further Pounds 25,000 in brief fees and Pounds 3,500 a day to appear at
court.
Lord Rees-Mogg might have to pay the Foreign Office's costs if he loses the
case.
Three other eminent - and expensive - barristers have been involved in
preparation of the case: Mr Leolin Price QC, who represented Lord Rees-Mogg
at the first application for judicial review, Mr John McDonnell QC and Sir
Patrick Neill QC, warden of All Souls, whom the anti-Maastricht camp had
originally hoped to make their lead counsel for the hearing.
Mr Jeremy Nieboer said he had become involved in the case in February and it
had taken up most of his time since June.
The services of a leading solicitor costs upwards of Pounds 180 an hour, so
the practice account could total tens of thousands of pounds.

FT  27 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Increased funds to aid energy
efficiency
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INCREASED funding for energy efficiency schemes is among the government's
latest plans for meeting international targets on global warming.
The government said that it would reinforce the newly created Energy Saving
Trust, set up to help households identify energy-saving measures.
It also planned to take energy use by central government to below 80 per
cent of 1990 levels by the year 2000, and to curb transport emissions
further.
Britain committed itself at last year's Rio Earth Summit to bringing carbon
dioxide emissions back to 1990 levels in the year 2000, a cut of 6 per cent
on projected levels.
In the spring ministers said that present plans would achieve two-thirds of
the target.
Combined heat and power systems in blocks of flats and offices, which use
the spare heat from electricity generation, are now expected to contribute
5,000MW of power by the year 2000, compared with the government's previous
target of 4,000MW.
Mr Simon Roberts, of the pressure group Friends of the Earth, said: 'The
government now describes its CO2 programme as 'complete' but it has not
specified how it will curb traffic growth, nor how it will reach the new
higher targets for combined heat and power and for the Energy Saving Trust.'

FT  27 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Minister rejects claims of regional
aid 'bribes'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR TIM SAINSBURY, industry minister, yesterday rejected Labour allegations
that political gerrymandering had determined changes in the areas qualifying
for regional aid.
He told the Commons the new assisted areas map announced on Friday ensured
that help would be concentrated on areas with the most problems. Mr
Sainsbury said that the changes made to the previous map drawn up in 1984
reflected the fact that unemployment had fallen in the north and north-west
while it had risen in London, the south-east and south-west.
Mr Neil Kinnock, the former Labour leader, accused the government of
indulging in 'pork-barrel politics' and Mr Bob Cryer (Lab Bradford South)
said that the new map reflected attempts to 'bribe' Tory MPs opposed to the
Maastricht treaty.
Mr Gerald Kaufman (Lab Manchester Gorton) complained that his constituency
would get 'no help at all' while Sutton Coldfield, represented by Sir Norman
Fowler, the Conservative party chairman, with less unemployment, was among
the beneficiaries.
Sir Teddy Taylor (C Southend East), a leading opponent of the Maastricht
treaty, protested that a decision by the European Commission had resulted in
Southend being excluded at what Mr Paul Channon (C Southend West) described
as 'the very last minute'.
Mr Sainsbury confirmed the commission had cut the overall coverage of
assisted area status, but stressed that the UK had not suffered as much as
Germany, which had been subjected to a 2 per cent reduction.
Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary, said that aid was being
provided for new areas by taking away help from other areas which still
needed support.

MR ALBERT Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, said yesterday that he would
be 'very concerned' if efforts to renew the political talks process in
Northern Ireland were undermined by any deals done at Westminster between
the Conservatives and the Ulster Unionist party.
Last week the Ulster Unionists voted with the government on the social
chapter, leading most observers to conclude - despite official denials  -
that there had been a deal on a plan to set up an Ulster select committee at
Westminster.
At Westminster yesterday, Mr Tony Newton, the leader of the Commons, said
only that a select committee was 'a matter which we continue to keep under
review'.

FT  27 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Major attempts to close 'bastards'
affair
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN Major yesterday sought to defuse the political row sparked by his
off-the-record remarks bracketing three cabinet ministers with what he
termed Euro-sceptic 'bastards' on the Conservative backbenches.
But the publication in a national newspaper of the full text of his
unguarded comments to a television interviewer provided fresh evidence of
the prime minister's frustration with his opponents within the Conservative
party.
As ministers and MPs prepared for the summer parliamentary recess the
opposing sides in the party's war over Europe made clear their unwillingness
to call a truce.
Tory opponents of Maastricht claimed strong, if quiescent, support in all
ranks of the government but the strongly pro-European wing of the party
called on Mr Major not to bow to the sceptics.
The Positive Europe group, representing nearly 100 Conservative MPs,
insisted that the government should press ahead with its policy of keeping
Britain at the centre of the European debate regardless of its critics.
Speaking after the Franco-British summit in London Mr Major dismissed
suggestions that the Maastricht treaty had been overtaken by events.
He insisted that Britain would complete ratification after what he expected
to be a relatively short court challenge by Lord Rees-Mogg. But he declined
to answer questions on the leak of his informal comments to a television
journalist in which he explained his reluctance to sack three cabinet
ministers - widely assumed to be Mr Peter Lilley, Mr Michael Portillo and Mr
John Redwood - who share antipathy to the treaty with backbench sceptics.
The BBC meanwhile, which was responsible for technical work at Downing
Street when the leak occurred, denied any role in passing on details of the
private conversation to newspapers.
Downing Street reinforced the impression that the prime minister was
determined to close the affair, indicating that Mr Major had not found it
necessary to speak to the ministers concerned.
Other cabinet colleagues said that the prime minister had been guilty of no
more than 'letting off steam' after a tough week. But Sir Edward Heath, the
former prime minister, renewed his criticism of Mr Major for appearing to
allow his policy on Europe to be dictated by a minority in his cabinet.
President Francois Mitterrand added to the prime minister's discomfiture by
brushing aside suggestions that the central ambition of the Maastricht
treaty - a single currency - had been put on the back burner.
The French leader said the Paris government still expected to achieve
economic and monetary union in the next few years.
Leaders of the backbench rebellion over Maastricht signalled their
determination to maintain the pressure on the government when it brings
forward legislation in the autumn to allow an increase in Britain's
contributions to Brussels.

FT  27 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Allason loses Tory whip
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR RUPERT ALLASON, the only Tory MP who failed to support the government in
last week's vote of confidence on the Maastricht treaty, was last night
suspended from the Conservative party at Westminster.
The punishment - one of the harshest available to the government's
parliamentary managers - followed Mr Allason's failure to provide a
convincing explanation for his absence for last Friday's vote.
It puts a serious question mark over the future of the 41-year-old MP for
Torbay. If the suspension - known as withdrawal of the whip - is not lifted
he will be unable to stand as an official Conservative candidate at the next
general election.
A letter to Mr Allason from Mr Richard Ryder, the chief whip, is thought to
have left open the possibility of readmission to the party if he supports
the government consistently in coming months.
In theory the move reduces Mr John Major's parliamentary majority from 18 to
17.
Mr Allason, who in private life writes spy novels, has long been seen as one
of those backbench MPs who have little or no prospect of attaining
ministerial office. An instinctive loner he has as many enemies as friends
among Tory MPs at Westminster.
A firm opponent of the Maastricht treaty, Mr Allason had earlier indicated
that he had apologised for his absence. But Mr Ryder was thought to have
judged that it would be impossible to maintain party discipline if he was
not severely treated.
Mr Allason said last night that he had had no opportunity to put his case
but added that he could not bring himself to vote for Maastricht. He said
the treaty represented the most important constitutional issue for 300
years.

MR ALBERT Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, said yesterday that he would
be 'very concerned' if efforts to renew the political talks process in

Last week, the Unionists backtracked on a general election pledge and voted

Mr Reynolds emphasised that the 1985 Anglo-Irish Agreement gives the Irish

He said that Dublin would view any unilateral moves by the British
government on the future governance of the province as a breach of the
agreement.
But he said also that he accepted a assurances that no deal had been done.

He said he had apologised to Mr John Major, the prime minister, and added:
'As far as I am concerned that is the end of the matter.' Mr Allason, MP for

He was described by Mr Dennis Skinner (Lab Bolsover) as the 'MP for the

REPORTED outbreaks of Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease, the human form of 'mad cow

released yesterday show.
The number of reported cases rose from 32 in April 1991 to 37 in April last
year, and to 48 in April this year.
Doctors think the rise was not 'statistically significant' and put it down
to increased reporting of cases.

FT  27 JUL 93 / M&amp;S offers graduates 1-year jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MARKS and Spencer, the clothes and food retailing chain, is to employ 100
graduates on one-year contracts because of 'concern about graduate
unemployment'.
The temporary contract jobs are in addition to the company's normal graduate
intake.
M and S said the scheme was being sponsored by Sir Richard Greenbury,
chairman of the company. Sir Richard said the special programme 'will enable
an additional 100 graduates to benefit from our one-year training programme
even though we are unable to guarantee a full career'.
The move follows a recent report from members of the Association of Graduate
Recruiters, of which M and S is a leading member, which said employers were
forecasting a fall of 6.5 per cent in vacancies for graduates this year,
compared with last year.
Since the forecast there have been reports of a late surge in interest by
employers in taking on extra graduate recruits.
Details of the M and S scheme were disclosed yesterday by Personnel Today
magazine.
The temporary recruits will take part in the training programme for
permanent graduate recruits and will be paid the same annual salary of
Pounds 14,000. They will receive career counselling to help them find
alternative employment at the end of their year with the company.
Ms Michelle Mendelsson, M and S recruitment manager, said that if the
company saw outstanding performers among the 100 temporary recruits it would
make permanent jobs available. The scheme was 'absolutely not' a way of
identifying high-flyers and eliminating less able trainees without any
further commitment, she said.
M and S said it believed it was the first company to provide a temporary
work scheme of this nature to graduates. Those who took part in it would
'have the benefit of being able to list work experience with M and S on
their CV,' it said.
The company announced recently that it would be taking an extra 100
graduates into permanent employment. It originally decided to take 150
graduates.
It said one of the reasons for raising its graduate intake to 250 was
because of the declining number of A-level entrants. More sixth-formers have
been continuing their education rather than seeking jobs.
In 1991 M and S froze graduate appointments after having offered jobs to 100
candidates - 70 went on to join the company last year.

FT  27 JUL 93 / Pounds 3.5m paid on life insurance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ADMINISTRATORS of Maxwell companies and Mirror Group Newspapers have been
paid Pounds 3.5m by a group of insurance companies in an out-of-court
settlement over a policy on the life of the late Robert Maxwell. This is the
uncontested part of a Pounds 6.5m settlement sought by the administrators
and Mirror Group Newspapers from Robert Maxwell's insurers.
It emerged yesterday that the payment was made two weeks ago and is being
held by lawyers acting for the administrators and MGN while discussions
continue on how the money will be divided. It is thought that only a small
proportion will find its way to pensioners.
This is in part because the administrators, Price Waterhouse and Arthur
Andersen, have decided to set part of the Pounds 3.5m aside in a 'fighting
fund' to finance legal action against the insurance companies that refused
to participate in the compromise.
These companies suspect that Robert Maxwell committed suicide.
Administrators hope that the threat of legal action may be sufficient to
bring the companies into line, but lawyers acting for them made it clear
that their clients were prepared to go to court over the issue.
Legal action is bound to revive controversy about the circumstances of
Robert Maxwell's death. Under the conditions of his policy, drawn up several
years ago but last renewed in April 1991, the full claim would be payable
only if he died from accidental causes or murder.

<TEXT>
LONDON Business Radio, which has applied for a London commercial radio
licence to broadcast a service aimed at business and industry, said
yesterday it hoped to take the service to other UK cities.
The consortium - made up of the GWR radio group, Reuters and Associated
Newspapers - said it would apply in September for an AM licence in
Manchester. Applications are likely next year for licences in Birmingham and
Glasgow.
The hopes of extending a radio service covering business, the City of
London, industry and personal finance depend on the consortium winning an AM
licence in London.
London Business Radio is one of 48 applicants for eight licences in London
and faces a direct rival in City Talk, a consortium put together by Mr Mike
Bloomberg, the Wall Street entrepreneur with a growing role in the financial
information business.
Libel proceedings may arise from the hiring of Mr Charlie Cox as managing
director of The London Radio Company, which is trying to displace LBC.
Mr Cox, a former LBC executive, said yesterday he was taking legal advice on
possible defamation proceedings over a press release issued by LBC about his
leaving.

FT  27 JUL 93 / London's tax burden criticised
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LONDONERS AND those working in London pay Pounds 8bn a year more in taxes
than is spent by central and local government in the capital, according to a
report to be published on Friday by the Corporation of London, the local
authority for the City of London.
The report, by Professor Douglas McWilliams of the Centre for Economics and
Business Research, says that the transfer of resources out of London on such
a scale will reduce the rate of growth in the UK economy.
The findings will provide further ammunition for businesses and London
pressure groups campaigning for more of the taxes paid in London to be
ploughed back into the capital's economy through an increase in public
investment in transport infrastructure.
The report says that investment in transport projects such as the
modernisation of the London Underground would increase GDP more than if the
same amounts were spent on social and other programmes elsewhere in the UK.
All countries have parts that are more prosperous than others and make a net
contribution to public finances, the report says. The contribution made by
London is unusually large, however. By adding to business costs it will
damage London's economic prospects in competing with other European cities
as a financial centre. That, it is argued, will reduce the rate of growth in
the rest of the economy, which is heavily reliant on London's prosperity.
The report says nearly 3m jobs outside London depend wholly or partly on
supplying the capital.
The report says that if greater London were an independent state its GDP
would be more than Pounds 70bn - larger than four EC member states and
comparable with that of Hong Kong. It would also have a healthy trade
surplus. Exports of goods and services to the rest of the UK and the world
exceeded imports by Pounds 10.6bn in 1989.
'In broad terms, London's economy is based on services, a high proportion of
which is exported,' said Prof McWilliams. 'It largely consumes manufactured
goods, a high proportion of which is imported.'
The fact that taxes paid have exceeded public expenditure in the capital for
decades is partly because people working in London have higher earnings. The
average job in London generates 43 per cent more income-based tax than the
average job in the UK.
Current public spending in London in relation to GDP is only 74 per cent of
the national average, however. Prof McWilliams says this is because much of
public spending goes on social support and relatively little on supporting
business. The report says: 'Without the London contribution, the UK public
sector borrowing requirement would be 10.6 per cent of non-London GDP -
higher than any other OECD country other than Italy.'

FT  27 JUL 93 / Whitehall property agencies reviewed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CABINET office has launched a review into the efficiency with which the
Civil Service manages government property holdings.
The review will look at the scope for giving departments and agencies
greater responsibility for managing their property, including acquisition
and disposal.
Sir Peter Levene, the prime minister's efficiency adviser, will carry out
the review, which covers thousands of properties across the UK.
The largest organisation managing government property is Property Holdings,
part of the Department of the Environment, which manages contracts worth
Pounds 2bn a year.
With more than 3,000 properties under management it is responsible for 60
per cent of the government's civil estate, housing parts of more than 50
departments and public bodies.
The terms of reference of the review indicate that the government is
concerned that it should not lose benefits that centralised arrangements
offer in the property market. Arrangements to avoid competition between
departments will be considered.
The review will also examine whether central advice will be needed on
matters such as health and safety, fire precautions and environmental
issues. It is due to be completed by the end of the year.

FT  27 JUL 93 / Lloyd's probe raps syndicate chief
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UNDERWRITER of two of the heaviest loss-making syndicates at Lloyd's of
London may not have appreciated the extent of his exposure to losses and
bought insufficient reinsurance protection, an investigation has concluded.
Details of the losses are contained in a report on Devonshire syndicates 216
and 833/834, whose losses in 1989 and 1990 exceeded Pounds 140m.
The inquiry also discovered that 'the general air of hostility and
apprehension that appears to have existed between Mr (Christopher) Bohling
(the underwriter) and his staff would not have been conducive to the best
running of the syndicates'.
Both syndicates specialised in so-called 'spiral' reinsurance, covering the
high-level losses of other syndicates and companies.
About 2,000 Names - individuals whose assets support the insurance market -
participated in one or more of these syndicates in 1989, 1990 and 1991. They
face average losses of Pounds 100,000 each.
Mr Alan Porter, chairman of the Devonshire Names Action group, said: 'This
report confirms the group's worst suspicions concerning the management of
the syndicates and strengthens the association's resolve to press for full
compensation for affected Names.'
The report into the syndicates, commissioned by the group, estimates that
the syndicates' losses may eventually deteriorate to Pounds 450m when its
accounts are finally closed.
Trinity Square Services, one of the UK's largest run-off companies, carried
out the report.
The investigation, chaired by Mr Anthony Blake, a partner with accountants
Neville Russell, took 17 months to complete. It discovered that a
considerable portion of the syndicate's reinsurance programme was placed
with the Korea Foreign Insurance programme. New managers made a
'considerable loss' when they settled these reinsurance policies in April.

FT  27 JUL 93 / Private medicine report delayed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MONOPOLIES and Mergers Commission was yesterday given an extra three
months - until December 7 - to complete a report into private medical
services.
Private medical fees were referred to the commission last September.
In a letter to doctors earlier this month the commission said it believed
that the way some National Health Service consultants set private fees close
to the guidelines of the British Medical Association and private health
insurers formed a complex monopoly under the Fair Trading Act.
But the commission stressed that it had not reached final conclusions, or
decided whether the effects of the conduct were good or bad.
A challenge to the wool-buying monopoly of the British Wool Marketing Board
failed yesterday when the Court of Session in Edinburgh banned wool
merchants Reid and Robertson from attempting to buy wool direct from
farmers.
Mr John King, the company's director, said the company would continue
lobbying parliament for a change in the law on wool marketing.
Reid and Robertson had told the court that since the government's removal of
the wool price guarantee farmers were still obliged to sell wool to the
board, but at a reduced price.

FT  27 JUL 93 / Spy HQ's cost was hidden, say MPs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE COMMONS foreign affairs committee yesterday rebuked the government for
covering up the Pounds 86.7m cost of fitting out a new building for the
Secret Intelligence Service.
In a report on Foreign Office spending the all-party committee accused
ministers of 'burying' the Pounds 45.5m being spent on the offices in the
current financial year.
It also notes that the total cost of internal equipment and furnishings for
the office complex on the south bank of the Thames at Vauxhall Cross is
expected to reach Pounds 86.7m.
That compares with Pounds 66m spent by Mr Jacques Attali, the former head of
the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. Mr Attali's expensive
tastes proved his downfall and he resigned earlier this month.
The overall cost, including the land, of the concrete and glass headquarters
for Britain's spy service - more commonly referred to as MI6 - runs into
several hundreds of millions pounds.
Designed by Mr Terry Farrell, its construction - coinciding with the ending
of the cold war - was vigorously opposed by the Treasury but was approved by
Baroness Thatcher, then prime minister.
The MPs do not disclose whether Britain's spy chiefs insisted, like Mr
Attali, on importing the highest quality marble from Italy or the best
interior designers from France.
They concede that the government does have arrangements for such expenditure
to be monitored by the National Audit Office. But they criticise the way
that such substantial amounts of money - equal to the amount that the
Overseas Development Agency spent in the same year on all its bilateral
emergency and refugee aid - was buried in more general expenditure totals
for the Foreign Office.
More generally the committee suggests that the Foreign and Commonwealth
Office should consider reducing the number of staff it has based in London
in order to free additional personnel for overseas postings.

FT  27 JUL 93 / Big names in City under fire: Maxwell advice rapped by MPs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOME OF the most famous names in City legal and accountancy circles have
been criticised by the Commons social security committee, which is
investigating the aftermath of the Maxwell pensions scandal.
The committee was particularly critical of Buchler, Phillips, the insolvency
practitioner responsible for liquidating the private interests of the late
Mr Robert Maxwell. With its lawyers, Nabarro Nathanson, it has charged
Pounds 1.1m in fees while claiming to have recovered Pounds 10m.
Representatives of the firm are due to be recalled by the committee in the
autumn.
The committee's report said: 'We have particular misgivings about the work
of Buchler Phillips as the receivers to the private estate and about some of
the information they have provided for the committee.'
The committee was also highly critical of the work of Robson Rhodes,
administrators to Bishopsgate Investment Management, the Maxwell-owned fund
management company which invested most of the combined pension fund assets.
It, and its solicitors Stephenson Harwood, have incurred Pounds 6.1m in
costs since their appointment in December 1991.
The committee report notes that of Pounds 247.9m Robson Rhodes said it had
'recovered, located and secured' since its appointment, Pounds 103.5 was
under its control on the date of its appointment.
A further Pounds 135.3m was under the control of 'old external managers' to
the pension schemes, many of whom would have returned the money with little
hesitation.
The committee believes the book value of recoveries was only Pounds 55.1m,
of which Pounds 11.7m is contested by one of the pension schemes.
In the period from October 1992 to May 1993 the value of monies recovered
was only Pounds 3.9m.
The report notes that in the judgment of Robson Rhodes' senior partner
responsible for BIM it is likely that litigation will be needed for further
significant recoveries because mediation is unlikely to produce satisfactory
re-sults.
No litigation has started although solicitors for one of the individual
schemes filed a writ as long ago as June 1992.
The report said: 'The committee is critical of the slowness with which
Robson Rhodes are taking legal action against those who still hold pension
fund assets.'
None of the firms criticised responded to the committee's criticism
yesterday.

FT  27 JUL 93 / Deep-mine losses raise sell-off doubts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH COAL failed to make a profit from its deep-mine operations in the
first quarter of its financial year, raising further doubts about its
attraction to private investors in the forthcoming privatisation.
Mr Neil Clarke, corporation chairman, told MPs yesterday that the 30
remaining pits in production made small operating losses in the three months
from the end of March. This compares with what British Coal calls
'substantial profits' in its first quarter last year.
Mr Clarke's disclosure to the employment select committee raises questions
about whether British Coal will be able to match last year's operating
profits for both deep mine and opencast operations of Pounds 545m, an
improvement of Pounds 123m on the previous year.
The problem is that British Coal is struggling with a substantial fall both
in sales and in prices. The electricity generators are taking just 40m
tonnes of coal this year compared with 65m last year, and at prices at least
15 per cent lower.
Mr Clarke said after the committee meeting that in spite of the losses the
mines were operating ahead of budget. He indicated that results would
improve markedly during the rest of the year.
The first quarter was punctuated by a high proportion of holidays. In
addition, productivity and efficiency improvements were still coming
through.
In the first quarter productivity was 25 per cent higher than in the
comparable period of last year; the improvement last year on the previous
year was 20 per cent.
Mr Clarke told the committee that the 22,000 employees who have left the
industry since October have received redundancy pay amounting to more than
Pounds 500m.
During the hearing Mr Clarke was closely questioned by MPs about why he had
not informed the Department of Employment earlier about plans, announced
this month, to make redundancies among white-collar workers.
In a critical report earlier this year the committee recommended that large
employers including British Coal should liaise closely with the employment
secretary when making job cuts. Mr Clarke said he had kept the Department of
Trade and Industry closely informed of developments; he believed it had
relayed information to the employment department.
He said British Coal was doing all it could to preserve the largest possible
coal industry.
He added that British Coal and the generators together had coal stocks of
48m tonnes, against requirements of about 14m. He said: 'The more stockpiles
grow, the greater the threat to the life of pits.'

Although it made an operating profit in 1992-93, exceptional costs of Pounds
1.02bn turned this into an overall loss of Pounds 588m, British Coal said
last week when it announced its full-year results.
British Coal is struggling with a substantial fall both in sales and in

FT  27 JUL 93 / MP protests at whaling by Norway
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR TONY BANKS, Labour MP for Newham North West, was freed yesterday by
police after he chained himself to railings in central London in protest
against Norway's resumption of commercial whaling.
No charges were brought against Mr Banks, a strong animal rights campaigner.
'I will continue to protest,' he said after the fire brigade cut him free
from railings at Norway House just off Trafalgar Square. 'What form of
protest I take will depend on the opportunities and the occasion,' he added.
In all 35 people were arrested after the protest organised by Greenpeace,
the environmental group, outside the offices of the Norwegian tourist board,
state railways and chamber of commerce.
Norway announced in May that it planned to resume commercial whaling in
spite of the International Whaling Commission's 10-year moratorium, which
Norway has observed since 1987. A majority of the 39 member countries of the
IWC refused to lift the ban at their annual meeting in May in spite of
intense pressure from Norway and Japan.
Since then Norwegian whalers from the Lofoten Islands, 100 miles inside the
Arctic Circle, have caught more than 100 minke whales. Norway estimates that
there are 87,000 of the 25-foot whales in the north-east Atlantic.

FT  27 JUL 93 / Banks predict crackdown on 'laundering'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CLEARING BANKS yesterday predicted a big rise in the number of transactions
reported to police as possible cases of criminal activity after an imminent
change in the law introduces the threat that employees who fail to do so may
be jailed.
The British Bankers' Association forecast a 'very significant' rise in the
20,000 cases of possible money laundering which are reported by bank
employees from the 1.6bn transactions that take place each year.
The Criminal Justice Bill, expected to receive royal assent this week, is
likely to lead to a sharp increase in the reporting requirements on banks
and other financial-services companies from April next year.
The bill widens the requirements so that banks must report not only
transactions suspected to be linked to money laundering and terrorism, but
also possible serious criminal activity such as fraud, theft and extortion.
It also introduces for the first time a penalty of up to five years'
imprisonment for bank employees who are negligent in reporting suspicious
activities, and up to two years' jail for directors of organisations that
are negligent.
Banks have argued successfully against the compulsory reporting of all
transactions above a certain size, as is the case in the US. Sir Nicholas
Goodison, association president, said this would have been 'crazy'.
But the banks have accepted additional costs - estimated at up to Pounds 30m
in the first year and Pounds 20m in subsequent years - associated with
additional staff training and the setting up of central reporting offices to
review branch suspicions.
Ms Sue Thornhill, the association's assistant director, said there was
likely to be 'an increase in suspicion at all levels' in banks as a result
of the introduction of the threat of criminal prosecution for negligent
staff and managers.
The association also emphasised its support for the call by Mr Eric Howe,
data protection registrar, for a tightening of the law to prevent people who
manage to obtain confidential data from banks from selling it to third
parties.
Lord Inchyra, director-general of the association, said that there appeared
to be 'a hole' in the law because it was not an offence to trade in
information, including account details, that was held as confidential data.
He said the association had developed guidance notes for banks to tighten
their security.

FT  27 JUL 93 / Campaign to boost women reaches 25% of workforce
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OPPORTUNITY 2000, the business-led campaign to improve the position of women
in the workforce, now covers more than a quarter of the UK workforce, it was
announced yesterday.
Business in the Community, the business-backed voluntary organisation behind
the campaign, said that 200 organisations had signed up. Recent recruits
included Oxford University and retailing chains Texas Homecare and MFI.
Members of Opportunity 2000 agree to draw up targets for improving the
balance of their workforces, which are then published.
A minority of members have set themselves numerical targets for the
employment and promotion of women. Other initiatives have included the
introduction of special training for potential female managers and the
introduction of job-sharing schemes.
The number of employees affected by the initiative is approaching 6m,
Business in the Community said. One reason for the high figure is that
almost all government departments have joined the campaign.
The initiative was launched by Mr John Major, the prime minister, in 1991.
The campaign's executive is chaired by Lady Howe and members include Lord
Alexander, chairman of National Westminster Bank, Mr John Birt, director
general of the BBC, Sir John Collins, chairman and chief executive of Shell
UK, and Sir Christopher Tugendhat, chairman of Abbey National.

FT  27 JUL 93 / Treasury toes production line: Peter Marsh weighs the
criticism of an initiative that gives senior civil servants a taste of
industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR DOUGLAS Wass, Treasury permanent secretary between 1974 and 1983 and the
person who has served longest in the post since the 1950s, likes to tell
acquaintances how he would have done his job better if he had had more
insights into the business world.
In the past few months Britain's most powerful government department has
been trying to transplant knowledge of industry into the minds of its top
officials, most of whom have never worked outside the Civil Service. The top
100 civil servants have been ordered to visit an industrial site at least
once a year.
The Treasury has also set up a new 'supply side' unit which will try to
ensure that more of its officials think about manufacturing issues. It aims
to do this while at the same time fulfilling its two main functions of
controlling public spending and co-ordinating macroeconomic policies in
pursuit of low inflation.
While some see the moves as practical steps to introduce new thinking into
the department, others believe they are aimed at deflecting criticism away
from the Treasury and keeping pace in the Whitehall pecking-order with a
resurgent Department of Trade and Industry.
The drive has been given new emphasis by the appointment as chancellor of Mr
Kenneth Clarke, who has stressed a new commitment to helping wealth
creation. It was set in train last year by Sir Terry Burns, permanent
secretary at the Treasury since 1991 and the government's chief economic
adviser before that.
Many have identified Sir Terry as having presided over a series of mistakes
in economic policymaking. In particular he is said not to have paid enough
attention to the role of manufacturing, to have underestimated the
inflationary boom of the late 1980s and to have misjudged the seriousness of
the recession.
The new programme is described by Mr Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary at
the Treasury, as a effort to create a 'friendly environment' for business in
the department.
The Treasury's 'supply-side' unit is in its industry division and headed by
Mr Bill Guy, a long-serving Treasury official. Mr Guy will have just one
other colleague in his unit, an economist. Although Mr Dorrell concedes that
two people on supply-side policies does not sound very much, 'it's more than
we've had before'.
Mr Howard Davies, director-general of the Confederation of British Industry,
criticises the Treasury for its past attitudes to business. Even so, he
finds the new initiatives encouraging.
He said: 'You will see quite an impact (in government policies) if the
Treasury begins to build up its own contacts with industry and gain a better
understanding of what business does. What we are seeing is a shift in the
balance of government policy a little more towards industry.'
Mr Graham Mather, president of the European Policy Forum, an independent
think-tank, is more sceptical. 'In part the effort is an understandable
self-defence against the threat of a rejuvenated Department of Trade and
Industry which is stepping up its own contacts with business. The programme
also represents belated recognition by officials that they need to correct
the impression of having underperformed during the 1980s.'
One former senior official at the Treasury, who left in the past five years,
says better contacts with industry might be a useful step but should go
further than short factory visits. The former official said: 'If the
Treasury really wants to understand industry it should go to the trouble of
fixing up discussions with specialised people such as finance directors,
whose pre-occupations are similar to those at the Treasury but who offer a
private-sector view. I don't see that spending a few hours watching widgets
bashed out will help very much.'
In spite of these comments, one of the businessmen on the receiving end of a
Treasury visit a few weeks ago thought it a useful exercise. Mr Paul Farrow,
managing director of West Midlands engineering company Deritend Precision
Castings, said of the half-day he spent with his Treasury guest: 'The
Treasury guy listened and at the end of his day with us understood some of
our problems. In the past, Treasury officials have lacked understanding
about industry because they've so little experience of it.'
Mr David Smith, managing director of Nesbit Evans, a maker of hospital beds,
also in the West Midlands, is similarly pleased about the visit two Treasury
officials made to his company recently.
He said he told the Treasury pair how the National Health Service could save
'tens of millions of pounds a year' by ordering his own variety of
power-assisted, washable hospital beds rather than the less sophisticated
types currently purchased.
He insisted this was not an example of 'special pleading' aimed at
increasing his factory's orders, but a straightforward case of exchanging
information in a way which - if his ideas are acted on - could cut Britain's
soaring public borrowing.
The Treasury has also been making greater efforts to talk to Mr Neil
Johnson, director-general of the Engineering Employers' Federation.
Mr Johnson is pleased by Mr Clarke's declaration of greater interest in
manufacturing. However, he still thinks the Treasury is too much weighed
down by its public-spending remit.
'I'm encouraged by the progress so far,' Mr Johnson said, 'but the Treasury
needs to go further in moving from a negative, counting-house mentality
towards a style which fits in with the real world.'

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NUMBER OF confidential company investigations started and completed by
the Department of Trade and Industry's investigation division rose by more
than 50 per cent in the first quarter of this year, figures released
yesterday show.
Sixty-three investigations were started and 64 were completed, compared with
40 started and 35 completed in the previous quarter. The division looks into
insider dealing and other offences under companies, financial services and
insolvency legislation.
Complaints and requests for company investigations to the DTI rose by more
than 20 per cent, from 280 in the previous quarter to 338.
Three people were convicted during the quarter following prosecutions
resulting from investigations carried out in earlier periods. In one case
two defendants pleaded guilty to false accounting offences and were
sentenced to 15 months and nine months imprisonment respectively, both
suspended for two years.
A defendant found guilty of fraudulent trading, theft, and possession of
forged share certificates was sentenced to 2 1/2 years imprisonment and
disqualified from acting as a company director for five years.

Colt Car Company, the Mitsubishi vehicle importer, is setting up a new

THE 600ft National Westminster Tower, a City landmark, has been found to be
structurally sound after the IRA bomb blast in April.
The severe damage caused to the building by the blast initially provoked
fears that it might need to be demolished. The bank said it did not yet know
how long it would take to get the tower back into use. The 1,700 people who

A MASS demonstration was held outside the Bristol printing plant of JW
Arrowsmith yesterday to mark three months since the dismissal of most of its
workforce, Roland Adburgham writes. Police estimated that about 450 people
took part.
The company, which specialises in printing technical journals, sacked 120
printers after they took industrial action over a pay claim. They were
offered reinstatement at their previous pay levels but were told the company
would no longer recognise their union, the Graphical, Paper &amp; Media Union.
The plant has since been picketed and on July 9 the company obtained a High
Court injunction against the union, restricting the number of pickets to
six. The area branch of the GPMU said yesterday that its officials had not
taken part in the demonstration outside the works but had held a separate
meeting in the city centre.
JW Arrowsmith has been advertising jobs to replace the sacked workers. Miss
Victoria Arrowsmith-Brown, chairman and managing director, said staff were
being hired at the rate of one or two a week.

FT  27 JUL 93 / Poverty the angel of death in Rio: A multiple murder among
the street children of Brazil
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINA LAMB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO pairs of torn canvas plimsolls with no laces and a grubby, bloodstained
blanket were all that remained yesterday of seven Rio de Janeiro street
children alleged to have been murdered by policemen.
The boys, aged between 12 and 17, and a youth of 22 were killed on Friday
morning while sleeping at the door of the Candelaria church in the heart of
Rio. The spot has been marked by a makeshift shrine and a primitive wooden
cross.
Late on Sunday night, three policemen were taken into custody after being
identified as the gunmen by Wagner dos Santos, a 22-year-old veteran of the
streets of Rio and one of the survivors of the massacre. 'I will never
forget that night even if I live 100 years - they must pay for what they
did,' he said yesterday as he recovered from two bullet wounds. Another
child is still in a critical condition.
But few expect real action to be taken to improve the lot of the thousands
of children living on the streets of Brazil's big cities. In 1990, the
London-based human rights organisation Amnesty International ran a series of
advertisements: 'Brazil has found a new way of taking its children off the
streets - killing them.'
Despite such pressure, the trouble has worsened since then. According to
police records, in the first six months of this year 320 children were
murdered in Rio - more than in the whole of 1991 - and aid agencies estimate
that between two and four children are being killed in the city by death
squads every night.
The problem is that the very people responsible for preventing crime are
involved. Mr Paulo Melo, a former street child who is now a state
assemblyman, says: 'Rarely does an extermination gang not contain a
policeman. Everyone knows who the murderers are and where to find them, but
people are scared to give evidence.'
He points out that a federal congressional commission in 1991 named
policemen involved but no action was taken.
More chilling still is the fact that there is considerable support for the
killings in a society which has become one of the most violent in the world.
Forced into the streets by poverty, the children, who are usually black,
survive through petty crime, often becoming involved in drugs and
prostitution.
Many local people, call them 'animals' and see their deaths as 'cleansing'.
Shopkeepers and hoteliers are believed to fund this 'cleansing'.
After the latest massacre, the overwheming majority of people calling a
phone-in on CBN national radio in Brazil approved of the killings and, at
the shrine yesterday, a man who identified himself only as Jorge, said:
'These children have been sent where they belong. We should kill them all'.
Poverty is at the root of the problem. According to the government, 43m
Brazilians, including 18m children, live in absolute poverty with a monthly
family wage the equivalent of less than Dollars 15.
The trouble has been compounded by the national economic stagnation of the
last 13 years and the movement since 1960 of more than 40m people from the
countryside to the cities, which are now appallingly overcrowded.
This is particularly clear in Rio, where a third of the population lives in
slums and, at night, small bundles that are children can be seen in shop and
church doorways, traffic tunnels and on the roadsides.
Iron bars have been erected around public parks in the smart district of
Ipanema to prevent the children entering.
Mr Ronofri Cabral, a worker from Petrobras, the state oil company, who had
brought his 12-year-old son to the shrine, said: 'This all comes down to the
failure of the state to provide a decent wage. What we should ask is why
children, many of whom have families, are living in the streets without
food, clothing or shelter.'
The work of those fighting to defend street children is hindered by
controversy over how many there are, with estimates ranging as high as 7m
for all Brazil.
Mr Liborni Siqueira, a juvenile court magistrate in Rio, attacked yesterday
what he calls the industria da crianca (child industry).
He explains: 'There are little more than 600 children living in the streets
of Rio and 302 institutions claiming to be helping them. That's crazy. These
groups have no interest in taking children off the streets while they can
get dollars from overseas agencies for supposedly helping them.'
Amid rising international pressure Brazil's President Itamar Franco, who has
been in Rio since Saturday to monitor investigations, yesterday directed the
foreign ministry to assure governments, particularly in Europe where the EC
has expressed its concern, that all possible action is being taken.
He blamed the developed world: 'The poverty and misery that exists here is
often caused by the industrialised countries, which place obstacles in the
way of our search for science and technology'.

FT  27 JUL 93 / World Trade News: China planners put phones before roads -
The implications of Beijing's decision to make telecoms a development
priority / Foreign Investment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS and BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BY THE year 2000, the Chinese government wants to install 75m phone lines in
the country - equivalent to three times the British Telecommunications
network and quadrupling current capacity.
If it did so at the rate of 15m lines a year - this year about 5m lines will
be installed - that would constitute annual demand for equipment equivalent
to one and half times that of the US.
Mr Jim Long, president of the Asian subsidiary of Northern Telecom (Nortel),
the Canadian supplier, describes the implications as 'mind-boggling in terms
of opportunities for telecommunications companies'.
He says they only became apparent to him at a recent dinner to celebrate a
new contract with Hebei province. The governor noted in his speech that the
'old wisdom' that China's provinces would get rich first by building roads,
then putting in telephones, no longer applied. Now, he said, the reverse was
true.
The extensive memorandum of understanding which Nortel signed last month
with China's State Planning Commission is a recognition that any supplier
wanting a secure, long-term foothold needs to have local production
facilities.
A factory in China can take advantage of lower labour costs, foreign
currency savings, and design and engineering expertise close at hand.
Another attraction for local manufacturers is that imports of telephone
equipment face a 25 per cent duty. The duty is waived only if the importer
has access to financing, but financing becomes more difficult as volumes
increase.
Nortel already supplies 20 per cent of the Chinese PBX market from a venture
known as Tong-Guang Nortel. It expects another joint venture to be turning
out equipment for data transmission within the next 12 months.
Its latest agreement is designed to extend the Toronto-based company's
presence to switching equipment and large circuits, as well as a research
centre for advanced telecommunications technology. The first fruits are
expected to be a joint venture to produce Nortel's flagship DMS-100 digital
switching system.
The company declines to identify its partners, but it says that a factory,
with an initial capacity of 2m lines a year, is nearing completion in
Guangdong province. Plans are already being drawn up to expand capacity -
possibly at a different site - to 4m lines.
Profit is at the moment a secondary consideration in Nortel's drive to
secure a hold in China. But Mr Long expects that earnings will have climbed
by 156 per cent a year between 1990 and the end of 1993, compared with a 35
per cent rise in revenues.
'While (China) is still not as profitable as mature markets, it is
nevertheless beginning to bring some return to Northern Telecom,' he says.
'We think it will continue that way to a point where eventually earnings
there will be more consistent with other major markets.'
The market for switches is dominated by Alcatel, the French supplier, with
an estimated 40 per cent share. NEC of Japan and Siemens of Germany also
supply from local factories. Ericsson and Fujitsu have carved out businesses
of some size, and smaller operators, such as the telecommunications arm of
Philips, the Netherlands electronics group, are also making inroads.
The two leading North American suppliers, Nortel and American Telephone &amp;
Telegraph, the largest US operator, hope to catch up the European leaders.
In March AT&amp;T signed a memorandum of understanding with the Chinese which
one company executive said could be worth 'billions of dollars' in orders
for everything from fax machines to advanced transmission equipment.
Mr Long believes that the North Americans owe their advance partly to a
growing Chinese demand for features such as intelligent networks, adding
that 'the market is definitely moving our way in terms of buying criteria'.
For their part, the European suppliers can point to contracts signed and
joint ventures launched.
Alcatel, believed to be the largest supplier to the Chinese market, earlier
this year won contracts worth Dollars 400m (Pounds 267m) for transmission
and exchange equipment to be supplied through two joint ventures.
China is now Ericsson's fifth largest market. In the first quarter of this
year it accounted for more than 7 per cent of sales - up from 3 per cent
last year, when it was the company's ninth largest market.
Three months ago, Ericsson signed its largest ever contract in China - a
Dollars 300m deal to provide switching and transmission equipment for
China's Guangdong Post and Telecommunications Bureau. Last month it added
Dollars 60m in business from the province for central office switching
equipment.
It has other contracts to supply equipment to Beijing, Tianjin, Guangxi and
Hebei.
Philips, the Netherlands electronics group which has a growing
telecommunications business, has three assembly plants in China, operated
with local partners. China is the division's second largest market after
Germany.

THE EXILED president of Haiti, Father Jean-Bertrand Aristide, intends to
name the publisher Mr Robert Malval as his country's new prime minister, the
US State Department said yesterday, Reuter reports from Washington.
The department said it supported the choice, but sanctions on the Caribbean
nation could not be lifted until other steps had been taken.
The president's naming of a new premier is a main step under a UN-mediated
peace accord, signed in New York this month, to restore Fr Aristide, Haiti's
first elected president, to power. Mr Malval's name had been expected.
In Port-au-Prince, the Haitian capital, UN and Organisation of American
States observers said yesterday that Haiti's deplorable human rights record
had shown no improvement in the early stages of the country's transition
from military to democratic rule.

   BOGOTA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ONE of the main purposes of Colombian President Cesar Gaviria's visit to the
UK, which began yesterday, is to persuade investors that his country is a
land of economic opportunity with an unfortunate image, writes Sarita
Kendall in Bogota.
He will be shuttling from a Guildhall dinner in the City, from the CBI and
the Bank of England, to meetings with Mr John Major, the prime minister,
other cabinet ministers and the press.
The Gaviria government's economic liberalisation programme, begun three
years ago, is at a crucial stage. After a relatively easy ride, cracks have
begun to appear. These are being papered over but economic experts are
questioning whether Colombia was ready for such radical reform.
Industry and agriculture have felt the effects of a big increase in imports
over the last 18 months.
Overall, the economy grew by 3.5 per cent in 1992, but agriculture declined
by 0.9 per cent and industry grew by only 0.9 per cent. Industrialists are
protesting at the inflow of cheap textiles, footwear, cigarettes and paper
products, and at the inability of the customs service to prevent contraband.
Not everyone is unhappy though - chemical and pharmaceutical companies and
vehicle manufacturers are all benefiting from cheaper imports used in their
processes.
Agriculture is in bad shape, however. Production of grains and vegetable
oils has fallen in response to low-priced imports, while export crops - such
as bananas, coffee and flowers - hit by international marketing problems,
are in further trouble because of the gradual revaluation of the peso.
So far the reforms have not drawn foreign investors to Colombia as expected.
Last year direct foreign investment limped up to Dollars 308m (Pounds
205.3m), excluding the oil sector which will be attracting much foreign
capital over the next few years as the Cusiana oil and gas reserves are
developed.

FT  27 JUL 93 / Low interest rates bolster home sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SALES of homes in the US rose again last month, maintaining a solid recovery
fuelled by low interest rates.
The National Association of Realtors said sales of existing single family
homes rose to an annual rate of 3.69m homes in June, up 1.9 per cent from
May and 11.1 per cent higher than in June 1992.
Mr William Chee, the association's president, said the rise reflected low
mortgage rates, which have made houses more affordable. He added that
sellers were asking for more realistic prices.
Home sales growth was strongest in the north-east, where the number of sales
rose 14 per cent in June. Sales in the north-east have risen 20 per cent in
the last two months, helping to reverse a decline during cold weather
earlier this year.
Sales also climbed in the south, up 2.9 per cent last month, but fell
slightly in the west and, more appreciably, in the Midwest. Economists
predicted the strong pace would continue in the second half.

FT  27 JUL 93 / US governors of flood states press for aid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GOVERNORS from flood-damaged US states arrived in Washington yesterday to
try to ensure that Congress does not delay the disaster aid they have been
promised.
Delegations from at least six of the eight states most affected by the
flooding in the Mississippi and Missouri river basins will hold talks today
with Senate and House of Representatives leaders and urge them to set aside
the dispute that last week held up a vote on a preliminary flood relief bill
to spend Dollars 2.98bn.
The House last week delayed considering the bill after Republicans had been
joined by 45 fiscally conservative Democrats, including some from flooded
districts, to block debate unless the new money were offset by spending cuts
elsewhere.
The House is expected to reconsider the bill today. Democratic leaders have
not changed it, but have allotted more time for debate.
Officials from the mid-western governors' offices said they wanted to be on
hand to twist arms and ensure that at least their own state congressional
delegations would not block the aid sought. 'Presumably they have made their
partisan point and will now do the right thing,' said one aide.
With another record crest of water expected on the Mississippi this week,
the system of earth and concrete levees that has so far averted even worse
flooding is rapidly crumbling. Water levels have been well above normal
since April, and waterlogged levees which had resisted earlier floodwaves
have now begun to give way under this renewed assault.
Several more towns along the Mississippi and Missouri were evacuated
yesterday when it became clear their levees were about to break, and
drinking water has had to be rationed in towns whose water treatment plants
have been inundated.
Although the flood aid bill under immediate consideration is for Dollars
2.98bn, the Clinton administration has already said it will raise its flood
aid request to Dollars 5bn, and has acknowledged that even this is unlikely
to prove adequate.
Estimates of the damage throughout the affected area now amount to Dollars
10bn-Dollars 12bn.

FT  27 JUL 93 / World Trade News: Exporters shift production to counter high
yen

<TEXT>
JAPANESE exporters are stepping up efforts to fight the impact of the yen's
sharp rise on profitability by moving more of their production outside the
country and increasing procurement of foreign-made components, writes
Michiyo Nakamoto in Tokyo.
A growing number of exporters are shifting manufacturing to lower-cost areas
in south-east Asia and China, or localising production for regional markets.
Seiko, the watch and precision instruments maker, said it might move low-end
watch production to Hong Kong, where it already has an assembly plant.
Komatsu, the construction machinery maker, is shifting the development and
manufacture of large construction trucks for exports to the US within the
year.
Within three to four years Komatsu is also moving production to Germany of
medium-sized wheel-loaders. The Japanese plant where the company now
manufacturers the wheel-loaders will gradually shift production to small
cranes.
Meanwhile, Japanese companies are increasing procurement of foreign parts to
help lower their cost base.
Fujitsu, Japan's largest computer manufacturer, will attempt to double
procurement of foreign-made parts by 1995 by securing more items from areas
such as south-east Asia and buying more local parts for products
manufactured overseas.
The decision would increase the average ratio of foreign parts in Fujitsu's
machines from about 12 per cent to about 24 per cent, the company said.
Fujitsu has set up an international procurement division and is increasing
the number of people with responsibility for procuring parts at ICL, its UK
subsidiary.

FT  27 JUL 93 / Colombian president seeks UK investment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   BOGOTA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ONE of the main purposes of Colombian President Cesar Gaviria's visit to the
UK, which began yesterday, is to persuade investors that his country is a
land of economic opportunity with an unfortunate image.
He will be shuttling from a Guildhall dinner in the City, from the CBI and
the Bank of England, to meetings with Mr John Major, the prime minister,
other cabinet ministers and the press.
The Gaviria government's economic liberalisation programme, begun three
years ago, is at a crucial stage. After a relatively easy ride, cracks have
begun to appear. These are being papered over but economic experts are
questioning whether Colombia was ready for such radical reform.
Industry and agriculture have felt the effects of a big increase in imports
over the last 18 months.
Overall, the economy grew by 3.5 per cent in 1992, but agriculture declined
by 0.9 per cent and industry grew by only 0.9 per cent.
Industrialists are protesting at the inflow of cheap textiles, footwear,
cigarettes and paper products, and at the inability of the customs service
to prevent contraband.
Not everyone is unhappy though - chemical and pharmaceutical companies and
vehicle manufacturers are all benefiting from cheaper imports used in their
processes.
Agriculture is in bad shape, however: Colombia is one of the few countries
to have left its farm sector almost entirely unprotected. Production of
grains and vegetable oils has fallen in response to low-priced imports,
while export crops such as bananas, coffee and flowers, hit by international
marketing problems, are in further trouble because of the gradual
revaluation of the peso.
The government has worked hard to bring inflation down to 22 per cent this
year and is unwilling to endanger its anti-inflation policy by accelerating
the devaluation rate.
Customs will, however, be looking more carefully at imports - especially
expiry dates, dumping, subsidies and smuggled goods.
So far, the reforms have not drawn foreign investors to Colombia as
expected. Last year, direct foreign investment limped up to Dollars 308m,
excluding the oil sector, which will be attracting much foreign capital over
the next few years as the Cusiana oil and gas reserves are developed.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SOUTH AFRICA has reached in principle an agreement with Japan to allow the
first direct flights between the two countries from next year, writes Gordon
Cramb in Tokyo.
The transport ministry in Tokyo said yesterday the accord, still subject to
parliamentary and other approvals, had followed talks in Pretoria which
ended on Friday.
Japan restored diplomatic links last year. It was South Africa's leading
trading partner until 1987 when it curbed further growth in commercial
dealings. Sanctions have since been lifted, but bilateral trade remained
unchanged in dollar terms last year at Dollars 3.57bn, with South Africa
enjoying a modest surplus.
Japanese carriers are to be allowed a total of two flights a week into
Johannesburg from any departure point, while South African Airways is to
have the same number of weekly slots at the new Kansai international airport
being built near Osaka.
But Japanese holidaymakers are likely to be wary of South Africa until
political violence there is quelled.

FT  27 JUL 93 / World Trade News: BAe facing delay in Taiwan deal - Talks
continue over Pounds 250m venture to build jet aircraft
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Aerospace may have to extend a July 31 deadline for a deal
finalising the company's Pounds 250m joint venture with Taiwan Aerospace
Corporation (TAC).
Mr Denny Ko, TAC's president, acknowledged yesterday the deadline might not
be met. 'We're still in discussions to see how the two sides can agree and
accept,' he said.
Mr Chiang Ping-kun, Taiwan's minister of economic affairs, intends to write
to Mr John Cahill, BAe's chairman, urging BAe not to insist on the deadline
for finalisation of the project.
BAe said it would 'review its position' if the deadline were missed. It has
a mandate from its board to negotiate until July 31.
Success of the venture is vital to BAE's recovery strategy. The joint
venture - Avro International Aerospace - will manufacture BAe's RJ family of
regional jet aircraft in both the UK and Taiwan. The Taiwanese site is close
to east Asia's fast-growing market and will have lower labour costs.
Late yesterday Mr Chiang sent an official request to the Taiwan cabinet for
official backing for the project. Written confirmation may come today, but
further discussion of financing details may delay the deal's final signing.
Mr Yang Shih-chien, Taiwan's deputy minister of economic affairs, said Mr
Lien Chan, the premier, 'stated his support in principle'.
An executive at one of the island's state-run banks said local banks would
not feel comfortable in approving funds to Avro without high-level
government support in writing.
The local bank consortium has said it will not extend financing until Avro
is legally formed.
Taiwan banking law prohibits a bank from extending unsecured financing to a
venture in which it holds more than 3 per cent.
Mr Ko also said the company was seeking 'clarifications' on 'two or three'
of the seven key conditions put forward by the Taiwan side to BAe. 'We hope
that this can be done in the next few days,' Mr Ko said.
These are likely to involve Taiwan's request for a Pounds 5m 'technology
transfer assistance fee' to help TAC undertake the assembly operation.

FT  27 JUL 93 / BJP chief prepares for Hindu India: Advani is determined to
broaden the party base, according to Shiraz Sidhva
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SHIRAZ SIDHVA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER years of being a party of upper caste Hindus and small traders, the
Hindu right-wing Bharatiya Janata party (BJP) has decided that it must
broaden its base if it is to achieve its goal of wresting power in New
Delhi.
Mr Lal Krishna Advani, the 65-year-old head of the BJP has been assuring
Moslems they will be safe in a Hindu India, and more secure than they have
been in a secular country with Mr Narasimha Rao's Congress (I) government at
the helm.
Already, the BJP's committees are nominating members of the less privileged
classes, something hitherto unheard of in the elitist Hindu party. Mr Advani
is also doing all he can to get away from the party's Moslem-bashing image.
Earlier this month a picture of Mr Advani warmly greeting a senior Moslem
religious leader head was splashed across Delhi's front pages.
Recently re-elected BJP president, the frail man who would be prime minister
refuses to accept blame for the country-wide murders of nearly 2,000 people
after his party encouraged the destruction of a mosque at Ayodhya last
December. Nine months after India's most traumatic event since partition,
the BJP is much stronger than when Ayodhya was its single issue.
Mr Advani has never been apologetic about his party's decision to support
the destruction of the mosque, which became a symbol of India's secularism
after his party insisted that it stood on the birthplace of the Hindu god,
Ram.
He blames Congress and other opposition parties for not explaining to the
country's Moslems that the mosque at Ayodhya had long ceased to be used by
Moslems for prayer, and instead housed a temple since 1986 when Mr Rajiv
Gandhi was prime minister. A local magistrate that year allowed Hindus
access to the Mosque for worship.
Mr Advani is prepared to face a snap poll in the event of the Rao government
falling. The man who engineered the Hindu party's meteoric rise from two
seats in the lower House in 1984 to 118 in 1991, knows that Ayodhya can
bring the party no further political gain, and that there is a need to widen
his party's agenda.
'We have always had a comprehensive approach to the nation's problems,'
insists Mr Advani. 'It so happened that the principal issue agitating
people's minds was Ayodhya in 1991,' he told the Financial Times last week.
'Any party who aspires to govern as pluralistic a country as India, cannot
afford to concentrate on one issue.'
Besides, claims Mr Advani, building a new temple on the site of the mosque
has become 'the nation's cause', with even Congress (I) jumping on the
bandwagon and sponsoring a religious ceremony there in June. 'A temple at
Ayodhya has now become the resolve of the entire nation,' he says.
However, he will oppose the introduction of a bill this week which seeks to
detach religion from politics.
However, secular-minded Indians are aware that if the BJP came to power it
could change the face of Indian democracy. The bloodbath after Ayodyha is
fresh in the minds of minorities who know that not all Advani supporters are
as reasonable as he is.
Corruption in high places is the BJP's newest mantra. With Mr Rao's
credibility in question after accusations of involvement in the Rs50bn
(Pounds 1.07bn) Bombay financial scandal, Mr Advani has been projecting
himself as a credible alternative. Much of Mr Advani's confidence stems from
the fact that the BJP is sure of winning the polls in the four states where
its governments were dismissed after the Ayodhya-related violence.
These include Uttar Pradesh, India's most populous state and Madhya Pradesh,
India's largest state, Rajasthan and Himachal Pradesh. Already, the party,
aided by the disciplined cadres of the Rashtriya Swayam Seva Sangh (RSS),
the parent Hindu organisation, is campaigning in the four states, where
elections are due in October.
The party plans to form a 'shadow cabinet' during the monsoon session of
parliament to expose the government's 'failures' in key areas such as home
and foreign affairs, defence, education and health.
The BJP will also intensify its campaign criticising Congress handling of
the Kashmir insurgency.
The party has periodically jettisoned its right-wing policies to criticise
the government's economic reforms programme. Mr Advani insists that there
are no contradictions in the party's economic platform.
'We are all for liberalisation,' he says. 'But internal liberalisation must
precede globalisation, and be carried out in phases.'

FT  27 JUL 93 / Hyundai strike action collapsing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   SEOUL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE INDUSTRIAL action at Hyundai, South Korea's largest conglomerate,
appeared to be collapsing yesterday as two of eight striking companies
concluded wage agreements and a third one is expected to do so today.
This follows the ending of the strike last week at Hyundai Motor, the
largest of the Hyundai subsidiaries disrupted by industrial action since
last month.
Workers at Hyundai Pipe and Hyundai Precision &amp; Industry agreed to accept
the company's 4.7 per cent pay offer in return for increased fringe
benefits. Hyundai Mipo Dockyard is expected to reach a similar accord today.
The Labour Ministry is concentrating its efforts on ending the dispute at
Hyundai Heavy Industries (HHI), the group's shipbuilding unit and the
largest subsidiary still on strike.
But HHI workers are insisting on the reinstatement of fired trade union
members, which the government refuses to accept as part of a wage agreement.
Officials are threatening to invoke emergency powers to end the strike as
they did with Hyundai Motor.
A Boeing 737 of Asiana Airline yesterday crashed into a mountain near Mokpo,
South Korea, as it tried to land during a severe storm. About 63 of the 106
passengers on the flight from Seoul were killed.
It was the first crash suffered by Asiana since the South Korea's second
carrier was established in 1988.
The aircraft had made three unsuccessful approaches to land at Mokpo and was
trying again when it hit the mountain due to low visibility.
The aircraft was insured for Dollars 30m, with Lloyd's of London holding
99.34 per cent of the insurance and Hyundai Marine Fire Insurance and other
Korean insurers the remainder.

FT  27 JUL 93 / Israeli attacks threaten Mideast peace talks: The
Israeli-Lebanon border
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
ISRAEL yesterday continued its fiercest air, sea and artillery onslaught in
more than a decade against Arab guerrillas in Lebanon, seriously endangering
the Middle East peace process.
Fears that southern Lebanon might be plunged into war mounted last night as
Israel said that a column of tanks and armoured personnel carriers was
moving into the area and as the pro-Iranian Hizbollah guerrillas vowed to
keep attacking Israeli forces.
For the second consecutive day Israeli aircraft, gunboats and artillery
pounded targets across Lebanon, drawing retaliatory rocket, mortar and
anti-aircraft fire. Hizbollah guerrillas stepped up their attacks, launching
more than 60 Katyusha rockets into northern Israeli settlements.
Arab governments condemned the Israeli offensive. Saudi Arabia, Qatar and
the 51-member Islamic Conference Organisation urged immediate United Nations
action to stop the attacks although a request by Lebanon for a Security
Council meeting was later put on hold, apparently at the urging of the US.
Council sources said Washington was anxious to avoid a debate when Mr Warren
Christopher, secretary of state, was due to fly to the Middle East at the
weekend.
Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary general, deplored both the
Israeli attacks and the rocket strikes against northern Israel.
However, on a tour of the north yesterday evening, an unrepentant Mr Yitzhak
Rabin, Israel's prime minister, threatened to make southern Lebanon
uninhabitable unless guerrilla attacks stopped immediately. 'We want to make
it unequivocally clear that if there is no quiet here, there will be no
quiet for the residents of south Lebanon,' he said.
At least 35 people have been reported killed and more than 130 wounded since
the assault was launched on Sunday in response to attacks by Hizbollah on
Israeli troops deployed in south Lebanon. The Israeli army said that one
soldier was killed and three others wounded in a Hizbollah attack yesterday
 -the first Israeli military casualties since the offensive began.
Thousands of Lebanese refugees were streaming northwards towards Beirut
after Israel warned residents of 35 southern villages to flee if they wanted
to escape further bombardment.
In Tehran, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's spiritual leader, urged the
guerrillas to strengthen their resistance against 'the aggressor and the
bullying regime of Israel'. Hizbollah officials said they would continue
their attacks and admitted they were designed to sabotage the Middle East
talks.
A spokesman for the Palestine Liberation Organisation in Tunis accused
Israel of having delivered a death blow to Middle East peace negotiations.
Mr Ahmed Abderrahman told Reuter that the 'aggression. . . shows clearly the
true face of the Israeli government as a war cabinet and not a peace
cabinet'.
In Paris Mr Alain Juppe, the French foreign minister, softened an earlier
condemnation of the Israeli offensive by a ministry spokesman and blamed
Hizbollah for the escalation of violence. Ireland also protested over
'unacceptable' shelling that had injured two Irish peacekeepers in Lebanon.
Syria, which lost three soldiers in the first wave of Israeli attacks, said
the continued action was putting the peace negotiations to a critical test
and endangering the stability of the region, a view echoed by Egypt, the
Arab League, Jordan and newspapers in Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates.
More than 30 attacks by Israeli aircraft, helicopters and gunboats were
reported yesterday, ranging from Tripoli in the north to Tyre in the south.
Hizbollah strongholds and camps used by Palestinian allies were the main
targets.
A UN spokesman said that repeated barrages of artillery shells had been
fired at the area just north of the zone occupied by Israel.
Israeli gunboats were also blockading the ports of Sidon and Tyre.
Yesterday's attacks came after an estimated 100 Katyusha rockets had been
fired by Hizbollah and its Palestinian allies at Israeli troop positions and
at settlements in northern Israel, where up to 150,000 people remained in
reinforced underground bomb shelters. Two Israeli civilians died in the town
of Kiryat Shmona on Sunday and 23 others were wounded.
Israeli leaders yesterday sought to reassure the public that the armed
forces would not be drawn into a large-scale ground attack as in 1978 and
1982.
More than 650 Israeli troops died in the ill-fated 1982 invasion which
forced the majority of Palestinian fighters out of Lebanon but also
politicised the Shia population and led to the creation of Hizbollah.
However, Gen Ehud Barak, army chief, refused to rule out at least limited
ground operations north of the Israeli-controlled area of southern Lebanon.
Mr Christopher said in Singapore that progress in Middle East peace talks
was the only antidote to the fighting. The State Department denied earlier
reports that the fighting had put his trip to the Middle East in question.
The resumption of fighting is also a blow to the Lebanese government headed
by Mr Rafik al-Hariri, the prime minister, who in the past eight months has
secured more than Dollars 1bn in foreign investment and aid towards the
rebuilding of the country.

FT  27 JUL 93 / Department store sales suffer record fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SALES at Japanese department stores were 8.9 per cent lower last month than
a year earlier, highlighting the continuing decline in personal consumption
and increased competition from discount houses.
The fall was the largest on record, the Japan Department Stores' Association
said, and was partly caused by unfavourable weather. Japan's unusually cool
June, brought an 8.5 per cent decrease in clothing sales, which account for
just under half of all sales.
Apart from waning consumer confidence because of lower bonus payments and
overtime cuts, department stores have been losing customers to discount
clothing and electrical goods houses. The association said companies had
also cut their spending on mid-year gifts for clients.
Sales of personal items slipped 4.8 per cent, household goods were down 12.6
per cent, and foods by 5.7 per cent. Tokyo department store sales fell 13.4
per cent, while sales in regional areas contracted 6.6 per cent.
The decline in personal consumption has prompted debate among Japanese
business leaders on the need for a cut in income tax or official interest
rates to stimulate demand. Finance Ministry officials are opposed to a tax
cut because the government is already having difficulty balancing the
budget.

NIGERIA'S Social Democratic Party (SDP) is considering further talks in
Abuja today with its rival, the National Republican Convention (NRC), and
the National Electoral Commission (NEC) as civilian politicians search for a
peaceful end to the eight-year military rule of President Ibrahim Babangida.
The presence of both parties at the meeting could revive plans for an
interim civilian government, which Gen Babangida proposed early this month,
then rejected after both parties had agreed to take part.
The SDP stands by the claim to victory by its candidate, Mr Moshood Abiola,
in the June presidential elections, which the government annulled, and
rejects Gen Babangida's proposal for new polls before the scheduled handover
of power on August 27. Although the party's national executive plans to
attend the tripartite meeting merely to state its opposition to fresh polls,
it has a powerful fringe group, many of them former governors and
presidential candidates, who are sceptical about the validity of direct
talks.
The positions of all the factions in Nigeria's political deadlock have
appeared so intractable in the past week, that the government has prevailed
on groups of traditional chiefs to counsel moderation.

FT  27 JUL 93 / Third no-confidence vote in India
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SHIRAZ SIDHVA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Indian government faced its third no-confidence motion in 25 months
yesterday, writes Shiraz Sidhva.
It was sponsored by the Communist Party of India (Marxist), with the support
of the Bharatiya Janata party (BJP), the National Front and the Left Front.
A day of acrimonious debate followed the motion, with the Congress (I)
staunchly defending Mr Narasimha Rao, the prime minister, in the face of
allegations that he had accepted a Rs10m (Pounds 214,000) pay-off from Mr
Harshad Mehta, the main accused in the Bombay financial scandal.
Senior parliamentarians such as Mr Jaswant Singh of the BJP and Mr George
Fernandes of the Janata Dal launched a blistering attack on the government
for its policies of 'drift, lack of leadership, corruption, and economic
mismanagement'. Socialist parties and the right-wing BJP, which has become
the largest opposition group in India by capitalising on Hindu nationalism
and fundamentalism, appeared to want to drive Mr Rao out of power for
different reasons.
Legislators will debate for two days and Mr Rao will be allowed to defend
himself tomorrow before the vote.
Mr Fernandes spoke at length to the House about how Congress (I) had 'sold
out' to large multinationals such as the US company, Cargill, whose proposed
salt project near Kandla port in Gujarat would lead to 25,000 people losing
their jobs and pose a security threat. He also accused the government of
covering up the Bofors gun scandal, six years after it broke.

FT  27 JUL 93 / US urges Asia to help curb nuclear weapons

THE US secretary of state, Mr Warren Christopher, yesterday urged Asian
countries to help curb the spread of nuclear weapons and warned them that
the growing sophistication of their economies meant Asia could become an
important source of equipment for missiles and for chemical and biological
weapons.
'This is a growing problem for Asia because economic and technological
development means the region can now produce chemicals, sophisticated
electronics and other products and services that the proliferators want, but
are now denied in Europe and the US,' he said.
'Asia is at the stage when its participation in international agreements and
establishment of export control regimes are most important.'
He was addressing the annual meeting between the six foreign ministers of
the Association of South East Nations (Asean) and their 'dialogue partners'
from the EC, the US, Japan, South Korea, Australia, New Zealand and Canada.
Asean comprises Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and
Thailand.
The main weapons proliferation problems raised at the talks in Singapore
concern North Korea, which is suspected of having a nuclear weapons
programme in breach of its obligations under the nuclear non-proliferation
treaty (NPT), and China, which is accused by the US of exporting components
for medium-range M-11 missiles to Pakistan.
Western countries, however, are also worried that Asian companies are
starting to supply lethal equipment and technology outside Asia.
In March a shipment of eight steel reactor vessels which could have been
used for making nerve gas or mustard gas were seized in Singapore on their
way to Libya under a UN arms embargo against Tripoli. They were made in
Malaysia. Libya said the vessels were for making lubricated mud used in oil
drilling.
Several other foreign ministers joined Mr Christopher yesterday in
emphasising the importance of non-proliferation of weapons of mass
destruction, after the first informal gathering on Sunday of a new,
18-member Asia-Pacific forum to discuss security issues.
Mr Kabun Muto, Japan's foreign minister, said North Korea could pose 'a
grave threat' to security in Asia and the world. The NPT should be extended
when it comes up for renewal in 1995, as should the number of signatories to
the chemical weapons convention.

FT  27 JUL 93 / LDP flounders without its godfather: An unseemly contest
without Kanemaru's guidance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S Liberal Democratic party, facing the new experience of life in
opposition, is feeling the loss of Shin Kanemaru, the fallen godfather, who
held together bickering factions, coerced and coaxed opposition parties, and
generally created order from the chaos of Japanese politics.
Needed in the backroom, Mr Kanemaru was instead in a courtroom, defending
himself against tax evasion charges and taking the rap for a corrupt
political system. Had he been moving through the better bars of Tokyo's
political district, the godfather would have calmed the fractious factions
and prepared the LDP for a difficult week.
In the next few days, the LDP must find a successor to Mr Kiichi Miyazawa,
the party president, but the greatest loss for the old order lies in its
inability to replace Mr Kanemaru. His resignation led to a split in the
party's largest faction, which he controlled, then to a split in the LDP
and, now, to the prospect of the party losing power.
If seven opposition parties can put their many differences aside, they will
be able to appoint the next prime minister and that will mean opposition for
the LDP, which has ruled since 1955. The seven are still negotiating over
policies and candidates. Members of the Social Democratic party, formerly
the Japan Socialist party, were undecided yesterday, while another
pro-reform party was having second thoughts.
The selection of Mr Miyazawa as prime minister two years ago was simpler. Mr
Kanemaru appointed him after having removed his blessing from Mr Toshiki
Kaifu. For the past decade, Mr Kanemaru oversaw the queue for the leadership
and cultivated the SDP, the largest opposition group, to ensure that
controversial legislation would eventually be passed by parliament after a
ritual show of outrage.
Without the guidance of the godfather, the LDP's leadership race has become
an unseemly rush. Two ailing elders, Mr Masaharu Gotoda, the justice
minister, and Mr Michio Watanabe, the former foreign minister, are potential
successors. Mr Hiroshi Mitsuzuka, who heads the largest LDP faction, Mr
Ryutaro Hashimoto, ex-finance minister, and Mr Kaifu are keen to take the
job.
Most of these candidates are unacceptable to younger LDP members, let alone
to the coalition partner that the LDP must attract to ensure that it has the
numbers next Monday when parliament is expected to vote in a new prime
minister.
At the July 18 election, the LDP won 223 of 511 seats, while the proposed
coalition of seven parties took 243 seats, independents aside.
In response to the unappetising array of LDP candidates, Mr Seiichi Ota, a
47-year-old LDP member, yesterday announced he would stand at a selection
meeting on Friday or Saturday. His candidacy is way out of order in the
LDP's strict hierarchical system, as Mr Ota has been re-elected only four
times, compared with the nine times of Mr Miyazawa and the 10 times of Mr
Watanabe.
Mr Ota is typical of the pro-reform members who insulted their seniors late
last week when party executives were called 'war criminals' for having
failed to win a majority in the election and allowed the faction of Mr Hata,
to become the Japan Renewal party. The remarkable conflict has been replayed
many times on Japanese television.
These younger members are crossing factional lines and are not prepared to
wait patiently behind an executive which has not recognised that the party
is on the brink of falling from office and lacks an organiser of Mr
Kanemaru's calibre.
The aspiring successor to Mr Kanemaru is Seiroku Kajiyama, a gruff, hustling
politician who seems unable to win friends and influence people. Three years
ago when he was justice minister, Mr Kajiyama toured a Tokyo red-light
district three years ago, delivering unscripted jibes which were taken as
insults by Asian women and Americans.
On election night, Mr Kajiyama, 67, the LDP secretary-general, plotted the
demise of Mr Miyazawa on national television, unware that his conversation
was broadcast by microphones in front of him. He was confiding
conspiratorially to Mr Koko Sato, 64, the LDP general council chairman,
implicated in the Lockheed bribery scandal of the 1970s.
These two share party power with a third executive, Mr Hiroshi Mitsuzuka,
chairman of the policy research council. Mr Mitsuzuka's confidence has grown
with the break-up of Mr Kanemaru's faction, which, through weight of
numbers, was the LDP's anchor and gave the godfather his influence.
There are now four LDP factions of relatively equal strength, all wanting an
inordinate share of power, and unable to concentrate on the crucial
nemawashi (literally, digging around the roots of a tree, the groundwork
laying). Mr Kanemaru may be a symbol of all that is wrong with Japanese
politics, but his shovel skills are unmatched.

FRENCH Foreign Minister Alain Juppe yesterday pressed for air cover for
United Nations peace-keeping troops in Bosnia, after French UN soldiers had
come under artillery fire in Sarajevo on Sunday, Reuter reports from Paris.
'We need air cover for our troops,' Mr Juppe said on television. France
would ask the Nato alliance 'in the coming hours' to finalise its planning
for the use of aircraft.
Nato has already assembled 60 combat aircraft in Italy to help peace-keepers
if they are attacked while protecting designated 'safe areas' for Moslems,
including Sarajevo.
'Nato has been working for weeks on operational planning for this force and
we must act now,' Mr Juppe said.
UN forces condemned the Serb bombardment as cowardly and threatened to
retaliate if they came under attack again.
Lt-Gen Francis Briquemont, commander of UN troops in Bosnia, said his men
had been 'maliciously' targeted by Serb gunners. 'That is the last time that
we restrain ourselves from exercising our right to self-defence,' he said.
The French escaped injury in the attack but several armoured vehicles were
severely damaged. The bombardment came just hours after a ceasefire was
supposed to have gone into effect.
General Jean Cot, a French officer who commands all UN troops in former
Yugoslavia, arrived in Sarajevo to visit the scene of the attack and said he
fully supported Gen Briquemont's stand. 'It is probably the most serious and
the most cowardly attack (on UN forces) since the start of this unfortunate
affair,' he said. 'It is clear. . . the attack came from a Serb unit.'
The French troops who came under attack were not able to respond, but action
had been taken so they could retaliate in future, said Gen Cot. He declined
to give details.
Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, denied his forces were
responsible, accusing Moslems of having mounted the attack to undermine
peace talks due to start in Geneva today.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE MAIN protagonists in the Bosnian civil war will meet in Geneva today to
resume peace talks on the republic's division along ethnic lines and a
possible end to the 16-month conflict.
The talks will centre on peace proposals which Lord Owen, the international
mediator, has called a 'painful compromise'.
Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, and Mr Mate Boban, his
Croatian counterpart, have eagerly backed proposals which would result in a
three-way partition of the republic along ethnic lines.
Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic has rejected their proposal to create a
loose confederation on the grounds that it would be tantamount to the
carve-up of Bosnia by force and would eventually lead to the annexation of
much of the country to neighbouring Serbia and Croatia.
Before leaving the Bosnian capital, Mr Izetbegovic revealed a glimmer of
hope for the results of the Geneva talks: 'I am going to Geneva with hope
but with fear. But I am firmly resolved to break the cycle of killing and
suffering. If this chances exists, we'll find it this time,' he said.
Mr Izetbegovic is expected to propose a federation comprised of several
provinces. The Bosnian delegation to the Geneva talks is designed to reflect
his calls to preserve the republic as a united, multi-ethnic state.
Comprised of Moslems, Croats and Serbs, it covers the spectrum of political
parties.
Mr Franjo Tudjman, president of Croatia, and Serbian President Slobodan
Milosevic will today also attend the talks, which are chaired by Lord Owen
and Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg, the European Community and United Nations
envoys respectively. The negotiations, which will remain in session until a
political solution is found, were postponed twice last week because of Serb
attacks on government strongholds.
While attention was focused on the tightening Serb noose around the Bosnian
capital, Serb forces widened their strategic land corridor at Brcko in
north-east Bosnia.
In the event of a partition, Serb and Croat leaders had agreed to give
Moslems, the biggest ethnic group, access at Brcko, to the River Sava to the
north, and to the Croatian Adriatic port of Ploce, to the west. But the
Serbian advance on Brcko has now made the realisation of this offer even
more unlikely.
The Serbs control all the key rivers in Bosnia except for the Neretva, which
is mostly controlled by the Croats.

UNITED NATIONS military commanders yesterday denounced a Serb bombardment of
their forces in Sarajevo as cowardly and threatened to retaliate if they
came under attack again, Reuter reports from Sarajevo.
Lieutenant-General Francis Briquemont, commander of UN troops in Bosnia,
said his men had been 'maliciously' targeted by Serb gunners on Sunday.
'That is the last time that we restrain ourselves from exercising our right
to self-defence,' he told a news briefing.
The artillery attack, in which French UN peacekeeping troops escaped injury
but several armoured vehicles were severely damaged, came just hours after a
ceasefire was supposed to go into effect.
French General Jean Cot, who commands all UN troops in former Yugoslavia,
arrived in Sarajevo to visit the scene of the attack at the Zetra stadium,
used in the 1984 Winter Olympics, and said he fully supported Gen
Briquemont's stand.
'It is probably the most serious and the most cowardly attack (on UN forces)
since the start of this unfortunate affair,' he said.' It is clear. . . .
the attack came from a Serb unit.'
The French troops who had come under attack had not been able to respond,

Cot. He declined to give details.
Mr Radovan Karadzic, leader of the Bosnian Serbs, denied his forces were
responsible, accusing the Moslems of doing it to undermine peace talks due
to start in Geneva today.
A spokesman for Unprofor, the UN Protection Force, said Serb officers were
expected to visit the stadium to take part in a UN investigation. They would
be shown from analysis of the shell craters that only their forces could
have been responsible.
Nato has assembled a force of 60 combat aircraft in Italy, which are ready
to back up UN troops in Bosnia if they are attacked while protecting 'safe
areas' for Moslems. Sarajevo is one of six UN designated havens.

FT  27 JUL 93 / OECD fears for faltering Romanian reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Romanian government's gradual approach to market reforms has failed to
overcome the influence of hostile interest groups while market signals have
been 'diluted and distorted' by bureaucratic interventionism, the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development found in its first
economic assessment.
It acknowledges the harsh legacy of extreme centralisation, economic autarky
and the absence of earlier reforms bequeathed by the Ceausescu regime. It
also notes progress in establishing the legal structure for a market economy
and privatisation. But it underlines that the collapse in output is now
longer and deeper than in other post-Communist reforming states, while
inflation remains high and exports are only growing slowly.
The desire to minimise the social pain of transition has led in practice to
'a lack of coherence'. As a result, 'price liberalisation remains incomplete
and state enterprises are not financially disciplined, undermining policy
credibility and requiring continued administrative intervention and
subsidies'.
Expectations of further price liberalisation have helped maintain
inflationary fears which have interacted with the exchange rate to produce a
dangerous cycle, the report warns. 'A determined effort is now necessary to
rapidly complete price liberalisation, stabilise the exchange rate and
accelerate those structural reforms which would improve the financial
discipline of enterprises.'
Noting that the economy is dominated by monopolies and tight oligopolies,
the report states bluntly that 'the imposition of financial discipline on
enterprises is fundamental'. It suggests closing 110 of the biggest
loss-makers and calls for an effective bankruptcy law and decentralisation
and acceleration of privatisation.
The report also chronicles the incompetence and confusion of the legislative
and administrative structures which have been 'overwhelmed' by the reform
programme. 'The situation remains critical, with the foundations for a
sustained recovery and transformation not yet laid.'

many in government
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ROMANIA faces increased economic and political uncertainty following last
Friday's failure to reach agreement on a new stand-by arrangement with the
International Monetary Fund.
This is another setback for the government as the failure blocks some
Dollars 3bn in badly needed foreign credits from the European Community and
the G24 developed countries. Few now expect the minority administration led
by Mr Nicolae Vacaroiu, which relies on ex-Communist and nationalist parties
for its survival, to last in its present form beyond the autumn.
The talks foundered chiefly over the IMF's concern at delay in the reform of
large state enterprises and the general lack of financial discipline
resulting in high inflation. A small technical team plans to return to
Bucharest next week to help the finance ministry prepare for a return of a
full IMF mission in the autumn.
The heart of the problem lies in the state-owned enterprises which still
account for 90 per cent of industrial production. Inter-enterprise debts
were written off in January 1992, but have risen again to around Dollars
2.4bn, equivalent to 20 per cent of GDP. Enterprises have also taken
advantage of negative real interest rates to run up large debts to banks.
The 100 most indebted state companies alone have bank debts equivalent to
nearly Dollars 300m.
Continuing access to cheap credits has undermined the banking system,
starved the emerging private sector of capital and threatens macro-economic
stability. The government, which includes several non-partisan technocrats
but lacks parliamentary support, has been unwilling to take firm action
which would involve the politically unpopular closure of large state
enterprises.
Reformers in the government intend to set up a restructuring agency by the
autumn to deal with the 100 most troubled companies, mainly in metallurgy,
machine-building and chemicals.
They also plan to complete legislation needed for enterprise reform over the
summer parliamentary recess. This includes laws covering bankruptcy, the
protection of competition, small and medium-sized enterprises, and capital
markets and securities.
But the main problem is not always the lack of legislation. 'Market
instruments don't work because they are not applied fully. We still have to
fight for market mechanisms,' says Mr Misu Negritoiu, deputy prime minister
who is considered the cabinet's key reformer.
Pro-reform opposition parties simply do not believe that an administration
staffed with many former senior Communists is capable of leading the country
through the transition.
'The government is incompetent because it does not understand or have
confidence in market mechanisms,' says Mr Adrian Severin, an opposition
leader and reform minister in Romania's first post-Communist government.
'There is general acceptance of the market economy, but in following this
route the government is acting against its deepest convictions.'
Nevertheless, the government has presided over some of the biggest price
rises since the overthrow of the Ceausescu regime in December 1989. Its
eight months in office have seen the final stages of price liberalisation,
with big cuts in subsidies which pushed up prices of some basic foods and
domestic energy more than five-fold in May. The introduction of 18 per cent
value added tax on July 1 and the abolition of a 30 per cent mark-up limit
on retailers have led to further price rises.
'Poland and Bulgaria went for one-time liberalisation in 1991,' says Mr
Mugur Isarescu, central bank governor. 'Then, they had 600 per cent
inflation, but now it is down to two digits. We are still fighting inflation
of over 200 per cent.'
The governing party, the recently renamed Social Democracy Party of Romania,
which narrowly won last September's general election by promising gradual
reform and increased attention to social welfare, has further fuelled
inflation by granting generous pay rises.
Official statistics for May show that pay awards more than matched a monthly
inflation rate of 30 per cent. But cash handouts have not been enough to
bolster the government's popularity. More than 60 per cent of the public
considers the government's performance as 'poor', according to a recent
survey by Irsop, a Bucharest polling organisation.
The government has been damaged further by its failure to respond to
widespread allegations of mismanagement and corruption. Both the prime
minister and his transport minister have repeatedly failed to state their
involvement in the recent sale of Petromin, the country's main shipping
company, to a little-known Greek concern.
Instead, the prime minister attempted to deflect attention from his role in
the deal by accusing the former transport minister of setting up a ghost
company with a reputable Norwegian company through which to siphon off
Petromin's profits.
Similarly, there has been little official response to a parliamentary
commission which suggested several leading members of the government,
including the finance minister, be investigated for corruption.

FT  27 JUL 93 / Turkey reviews its spheres of influence: Ankara is raising
its profile in regional and Middle East affairs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN a senior US strategist allots Turkey a prominent role in American
Middle East policy a few raised eyebrows should be expected in Ankara.
Surprising then that there was so little Turkish press comment after such an
assessment by Mr Martin Indyk, a key adviser to the Clinton administration;
a measure perhaps of how Turkish opinion has absorbed the changes wrought by
the Gulf war.
Turkey is tentatively assuming a higher profile across a broad range of
policies, from the Arab-Israeli dispute, to the region's water problems and
the unresolved issue of Iraq and the Kurdish question.
Underlining the point, Mr Hikmet Cetin this week becomes the first Turkish
foreign minister to visit Israel.
Part of Ankara's apparent willingness to assume a greater regional role is
no doubt tactical and comes from a realisation that its application to
membership of the European Community is stalled and its future in European
security structures unclear.
But the strategic arguments for rethinking policy are also compelling. In
the wake of the Gulf war, Turkish officials have come to accept that even a
threat to the security of a distant Gulf state has a direct impact on
Turkey. This perception is the main reason for the Dollars 4bn Turkish
Defence Fund, set up to boost Turkish defence capability.
The turning point was the late President Turgut Ozal's decision, taken
against domestic opposition, to allow the US to use Turkey's bases in the
war with Iraq. If there is now to be a regional solution in the wake of any
Arab-Israeli peace settlement, Turkey will have an important role,
controlling as it does two of the region's main rivers, the Euphrates and
the Tigris.
Certainly a few years ago it would have been unthinkable for an Arab
minister to suggest that Turkey had a role in the Middle East peace process.
It would have been equally unthinkable for a Turkish minister to welcome
such an idea. But Arab governments have been acknowledging Turkey's weight
in the region - as did Mr Talal Al-Hassan, Jordan's minister of state for
foreign affairs, when Mr Cetin arrived in Amman, on the first stop of his
five-day regional shuttle.
More broadly, Turkey offers itself as a model of moderation, an economic and
military power both Moslem and secular, and a long-time US ally. The US for
its part has helped nurture a thaw in Turkey's relations with the Syrians.
Conversely while US relations with Iran remain frozen, Turkey provides an
informal conduit for US interests particularly on the commercial side, where
Turkish subsidiaries of US companies are doing lively trade with Tehran.
But considerable difficulties remain, not least the Turkish perception that
its immediate neighbours are helping forment Turkey's own Kurdish problem
through support for the Kurdistan Workers party, the PKK. At its crudest,
Turkish diplomacy towards the Arabs has been a form of damage control.
Recent efforts to win Syrian assurances on curbing PKK activities have come
to nothing. The breakdown of a short-lived ceasefire in May is in part
attributed to Syrian disappointment at the failure to make progress on talks
towards a final allocation of the waters of the Euphrates.
Many Turks still disapprove of moves to strengthen links with Moslem
neighbours and there is some anxiety that Turkey's increased involvement in
the Middle East could divert its energies from its overriding goal - to be
part of Europe.

THE European Commission, yesterday gave the go-ahead for Usinor Sacilor, the
world's second largest steelmaker, and Arbed, the Luxembourg steel producer,
to rationalise their businesses.
The merger and swap of activities is the latest deal between Arbed and
Usinor of France to have received Commission blessing. The aim is to
restructure the depressed European steel market.
The announcement comes two days before the Commission debates scaled-back
plans for Brussels to vet more cross-border takeovers.
Under the Usinor-Arbed agreement, Arbed will specialise in the production

FT  27 JUL 93 / Warsaw 'ready to revive talks with creditors'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THE Polish finance minister, Mr Jerzy Osiatynski, yesterday proclaimed
Warsaw's willingness to resume debt reduction negotiations with its
commercial bank creditors but 'only if we are certain that the banks are
ready to conduct constructive talks in good faith'.
The first round of talks to reduce and reschedule Poland's Dollars 12.3bn
(Pounds 8.2bn) debt to the London Club of commercial bank creditors
collapsed last week after the Poles rejected the Club's starting offer.
Mr Osiatynski emphasised that 'Poland needs an agreement with the banks but
not at any price, not at the price of undermining the present reforms and
agreements with other partners'. This was a reference to Poland's 1991
agreement with the Paris Club which reduced the Dollars 33bn owed to western
governments by 50 per cent.
Poland is looking for a similar reduction in its commercial bank debt
burden. But Mr Osiatynski said the proposal presented by the banks last week
represented 'a 28 per cent reduction, which, after subtracting the Dollars
2.5bn up-front payment that implementation of the agreement would cost,
signifies an 8 per cent net reduction'.
The assessment was contested by a spokesman for the London Club last night,
who said that Poland, which the club classifies as a 'middle income,
European country', was offered a 33 per cent reduction, closely aligned to
the standard Brady-type debt reduction which is usually only offered to
developing country debtors. He emphasised that the banks presented the offer
as a 'starting point for negotiations' and added: 'We also want to sit down
and continue negotiations with Poland.'
The 10-man London Club negotiating team represents over 400 creditor banks,
including the heavily committed German and other European banks which are
anxious not to create a precedent for generous debt reduction which could be
seized upon by Russia, Bulgaria and other big debtors. But the banks
recognise that the political hiatus before the Polish general elections on
September 19 offers a 'window of opportunity' for an agreement.
The Polish negotiators, meanwhile, are restrained by tight, IMF-imposed
budgetary restraints and heavy existing repayment commitments to the Paris
Club and other creditors. Warsaw has obtained pledges worth Dollars 1.3bn
from the World Bank and other international institutions to finance a London
Club deal and is ready to devote Dollars 400m a year to servicing its
commercial bank debt.
According to Mr Osiatynski, the London Club's proposal would initially mean
annual payments of Dollars 600m increasing swiftly to Dollars 1bn a year.

FT  27 JUL 93 / Schering MS drug approved in US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FIRST effective treatment for multiple sclerosis (MS) has been approved
for use in the US, the world's largest market, by the Food and Drug
Administration.
The approval is the first anywhere in the world for the drug, called
Betaseron, which was developed by Schering, the German bioscience group.
It is the first to treat the underlying disease. Existing therapies only
reduce the symptoms of illness, not its progression.
Schering's shares rose DM15.50 to DM850.
The medicine, a biotechnology-derived product, was recommended by an FDA
advisory committee in March for the treatment of relapsing/remitting
multiple sclerosis.
It was only submitted in June last year, which demonstrates the FDA's belief
in the urgent need for the product.
The drug has proved difficult to manufacture in commercial quantities and
will be made in the US by Chiron Corp, a Californian-based company which
will receive 15 per cent of sales. Chiron's shares rose Dollars 3 1/2 to
Dollars 68 1/2 .
Schering is building a European production facility and plans to start
clinical trials there shortly.
The disease affects as many as 350,000 people in the US, of whom between
125,000 and 150,000 suffer from this form of multiple sclerosis. In Europe
there are about 3m multiple sclerosis sufferers. About 65 per cent of
patients are women.
Betaseron will cost between Dollars 5,000 and Dollars 7,000 per patient per
year. Schering estimates treatment of multiple sclerosis can currently cost
up to Dollars 20,000 a year.
The German group is predicting annual sales of up to DM750m by the end of
the decade.
The approval was given on the basis of a trial of more than 300 multiple
sclerosis patients.
It showed that Betaseron can double the time between attacks as well as
lessening their severity. Side effects include fevers and flu-like symptoms.

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INCREASES in insurance costs and dearer bananas contributed to a further
increase in western German inflation this month.
Provisional figures from three main states, published yesterday, tended to
confirm forecasts of a modest rise in the cost-of-living index.
Most economists expect an annual rate of between 4.2 per cent and 4.4 per
cent for all of western Germany to be ann-ounced later this week when the
various state figures have been collated. Figures for June showed an annual
inflation rate of 4.2 per cent.
Early in the day, the stock market received a boost when Baden-Wurttemberg
reported a rise of just 0.1 per cent in consumer prices over June. Traders
speculated this might encourage the Bundesbank to cut interest rates on
Thursday.
But later details, showing price increases of 0.2 per cent on the month in
North Rhine-Westphalia and Hesse, raising annual inflation rates there to
4.1 per cent and 4.8 per cent respectively, were more in line with general
forecasts.
Economists suggested that the figures had already been allowed for in the
Bundesbank's calculations and that the main question was how far the central
bank felt able to move to support the French franc without compromising its
reputation for firm resistance to inflation.
Ms Ros Lifton at Nomura Research in Frankfurt found the decision 'hard to
call', although a further 'encouraging' cut in the rate at which the central
bank supplies wholesale funds to the market was possible. This 'repo' rate
was set last week at 7.15 per cent, and any further cuts will be made known
tomorrow.
Deutsche Bank Research suggested there was a 60 per cent chance of a cut in
the Bundesbank's key discount rate on Thursday. Deutsche Bank's Paris office
said an 'unambiguous' reduction would take the pressure off the franc,
although most observers believe the Bundesbank is more likely to continue
its quarter or half-point cuts.
High rents and service costs are still the main source of inflationary
pressure, but an increase in taxes on insurance premiums, introduced on July
1, have also played a role.
In North Rhine-Westphalia, statisticians noted that bananas, Germany's most
popular fruit, are 30 per cent dearer than a year ago because the EC has
forced Germany to buy from dearer suppliers.

FT  27 JUL 93 / GM fires new salvo in row with VW
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GENERAL MOTORS has opened up a new flank in its assault on Volkswagen by
raising doubts about legal testimony from Mr Ferdinand Piech, the VW
chairman.
Lawyers representing Adam Opel, GM's German subsidiary, have written to
public prosecutors in Hamburg, suggesting they examine 'discrepancies'
between evidence in a civil case in Hamburg on July 15.
The letter is the most explicit attempt yet by Opel to involve Mr Piech
directly in the GM/VW industrial espionage case.
At the July 15 hearing written and verbal testimony from GM employees
clashed with affidavits from Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, VW's
production director, and two of his colleagues. Other evidence, produced by
lawyers for Der Spiegel news magazine, which was fighting a VW attempt to
prevent it effectively from reporting on the VW/GM ind-ustrial espionage
case, contradicted a statement from Mr Piech.
The VW chairman said in an affidavit that Mr Lopez did not decide to leave
GM for VW until March 9. However, the magazine's lawyers produced an article
from the March edition of a magazine, TopBusiness, showing photographs of VW
board members. A picture of Mr Lopez was captioned 'Production' and marked
'New'. Mr Peter Carl, editor-in-charge of the magazine, said yesterday the
edition closed for printing on February 3. The inclusion of the Lopez
appointment had been confirmed by VW, he said, 'otherwise, we would not have
known'.
Other clashes of testimony concerned a wad of documents allegedly handed to
Mr Lopez shortly before he was due to leave GM, missing photographs of a new
Opel car, and details of a secret diesel engine.
The court later ruled mainly in favour of Der Spiegel, allowing it to
continue its reporting of 'admissible suspicions', and obliged VW to pay the
lion's share of the costs.
Volkswagen said yesterday that it it stood by all the statements presented
at the hearing. 'These are affidavits, and therefore true,' Mr Lutz
Schilling, chief spokesman said.
In a further development yesterday, Mr Jens Neumann, a VW director, stated
that at no time had he asked for or been given any GM secret documents. He
was replying to revelations at the weekend of contacts between himself and
Mr Lopez in early February, around the time when Mr Lopez was given more
details of GM group plans.
Mr Neumann, whose responsibilities by that time had been expanded to include
group management development, as well as corporate strategy and
organisation, said he met and spoke to Mr Lopez for the first time on
January 15. He discussed VW's proposed terms of employment on several
occasions between February 4 and when Mr Lopez finally signed the contract
on March 9.

FT  27 JUL 93 / Italian hauliers debate offer as strike continues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A STRIKE by thousands of independent road hauliers in Italy was set to
continue today as union leaders consider a government offer unveiled last
night.
Officials of the Unatras union said the offer comprised about L150bn (Pounds
63m) in tax breaks and an increase of 2 to 3 per cent in state-controlled
tariffs. Unatras has demanded L250bn of tax breaks and a 20 per cent rise in
tariffs.
Mr Raffaele Costa, the transport minister, expressed hope that the strike
could soon end as the government yesterday tried to minimise the impact of
the first day of a two-week strike, during which queues built up at petrol
stations. Some stores claimed supplies of fresh food and vegetables were
running low.
Mr Michele Sellitti, a junior transport minister, underlined the rights of
non-striking drivers to continue working and warned the government might
intervene to guarantee supplies if talks with Unatras failed. 'It is
unthinkable in a modern law-abiding state to leave big cities without
supplies of food or fuel for a fortnight,' Mr Sellitti said.
The signs of flexibility on the part of the government reflected by last
night's offer contrasted with a clear determination by ministers not to let
the striking hauliers gain the upper hand.
Government officials took pains to point out that many petrol stations would
continue to be supplied normally, as many big oil companies had their own
tanker fleets. Some fuel tankers were escorted by police yesterday.
Officials from non-striking transport unions noted that Unatras drivers
represented only about 30 per cent of Italy's road hauliers.
Up to 60 per cent of petrol is distributed by either non-striking unions or
by the oil companies' own fleets, according to one estimate.
However, panic buying by motorists or the possibility of blockades of fuel
depots by striking hauliers means there is still a risk of some petrol
stations running dry.
The government and non-striking hauliers are also concerned that striking
drivers might obstruct highways and frontier crossings if they believe the
strike is not having enough effect.

FT  27 JUL 93 / Yeltsin lets in a rouble own-goal: The bewildering politics
of a central bank move
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN senior ministers of the Russian government were summoned to a meeting
in the cabinet of ministers building in Moscow on Friday night, they had
been given no warning of what they were to be told.
Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin, the prime minister, told them the central bank had
decided to announce the next day that:
All pre-1993 notes in circulation would cease to be honoured from the
following Monday;
Russians had two weeks in which they could change up to Rbs35,000 of old for
new money (foreigners one day);
And arrangements would be made for those former Soviet republics still in
the rouble zone - 10 out of 15 - to exchange their old notes.
There was little discussion: according to one account of the meeting, the
decision had already been taken and Mr Chernomyrdin, with Mr Viktor
Gerashchenko, the central bank chairman, used the meeting simply to inform
the ministers, not to ask their opinion.
No representative of the finance ministry attended the meeting: Mr Boris
Fyodorov, the deputy prime minister in charge of finance, was in Washington
and Mr Sergei Dubinin, his first deputy, had just gone on holiday.
Mr Andrei Vavilov, the ranking deputy minister, was told of the move after
the meeting by Mr Anatoly Chubais, the deputy prime minister in charge of
privatisation - the only minister present to raise objections.
The decision was published on Saturday morning and immediately led to queues
at the shops and the currency exchange offices as people tried to exchange
pre-1993 notes for goods and hard currency. By Sunday, the old notes were
being exchanged for about Rbs2,000 to the dollar.
As the citizens queued again at those shops that were open on Sunday
morning, the president had cut short a two-week break in the Russian
countryside to return to Moscow - where a series of decisions by the
parliament over the past week had put in jeopardy the privatisation
programme, control of the budget and the position of foreign banks.
Among his first visitors were Mr Sergei Filatov, his chief of staff, and Mr
Vavilov: they begged him to sign an order rescinding the decision of the
central bank and firing Mr Gerashchenko. They met several times: at the last
meeting, they were sure he would sign such a decree.
Mr Fyodorov gave an interview from Washington to the Moscow Radio Mayak,
denouncing the move as 'a provocation aimed at the prestige of the state,
the president and the government' - even though he must by then have known
that the prime minister had approved the move.
He was not alone. Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, the Russian parliamentary speaker
and an increasingly bitter foe of the president, went on television also to
demand that the bank rescind, and threatened to fire 'senior officials' if
it refused. Mr Khasbulatov, under the existing constitution, has the power
to see that this was done: the central bank is responsible to parliament,
not to the government or the president.
Others crowded on to the bandwagon. The leadership of the hardline National
Salvation Front saw the move as one made by the 'anti-popular' forces in the
cabinet to 'establish a colonial regime (controlled) by pro-western
puppets'.
The Civic Union, which prefers to be known as centrist, also blamed the
government, in particular the reformers within it - just the people who were
yesterday striving to get the decision reversed.
As far as can be determined, it was the central bank's leadership and the
centrists in the government, led by the prime minister, who took the
decision. The reformists were against it more because of method than aim:
for one thing, to make it clear that the currency is Russian gives the other
republics notice that they must abide by central bank discipline, long an
aim of the reformers.
But, as Mr Fyodorov said, the announcement was reminiscent of a command
economy rather than what might be expected of a reforming government.
Mr Yeltsin called an emergency meeting of his security council yesterday
afternoon - after which he issued a decree aimed at 'protecting the rights
and legitimate interests of the citizens', lifting the ceiling of money to
be changed to Rbs100,000 and extending the deadline for changing roubles
until the end of August. He also decreed that Rbs10,000 notes could be
exchanged freely, even if they bore the 1992 date.
Mr Yeltsin's role has dismayed western economists. Professor Stanley Fisher,
the former chief economist for the World Bank, said: 'Yeltsin has softened
the original move but it's still a very bad idea. It shouldn't have been
done. It's not terrible to create a new currency but it is terrible to
confiscate roubles from those who work in the free part of the economy.'
Mr Fyodorov, whose public statements have been vitriolic, returns from
Washington today and must decide whether to submit to the president's
compromise or to oppose it, possibly to the extent of submitting his
resignation as minister responsible for the country's finances.
It will be a hard choice, for it will be in the face of evidence that the
government's anti-inflationary policy was beginning to show some results.

FT  27 JUL 93 / News Corp in Dollars 525m deal for Hong Kong TV group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY and SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR RUPERT MURDOCH's News Corporation yesterday bought control of
HutchVision, operator of StarTV, a Hong Kong-based satellite television
system whose broadcasts reach 38 countries from China and Indonesia to Japan
and Afghanistan.
The Dollars 525m (Pounds 350m) deal takes Mr Murdoch a large step towards
realising his media ambitions in Asia. Star TV's five channels, including
BBC World Service Television, are available to an estimated 45m viewers in
11m homes.
Half the consideration for the deal, which values Star at Dollars 850m, is
in cash and the other half in News Corp shares.
Mr Murdoch said last night: 'I am very, very thrilled. It's got a long way
to go but it has got the potential to be two or three Skys.'
News Corp has a 50 per cent stake in British Sky Broadcasting, which runs
Sky Television in the UK, a venture in which Pearson, owner of the Financial
Times, also has a stake.
Mr Murdoch beat Pearson, the media and banking group, to take a 63.6 per
cent stake in the Hong Kong broadcaster. Some Pearson executives apparently
thought until recently that the deal was theirs. Pearson was not available
for comment last night.
Mr Murdoch signed the HutchVision agreement last Thursday on his yacht
Morning Glory in the Mediterranean with Mr Li Ka-shing, one of the richest
men in Hong Kong. Mr Li and his family own 50 per cent of HutchVision. The
rest is owned by Hutchison Whampoa, a company which Mr Li controls.
A Hong Kong executive close to the negotiations said last night: 'I don't
think that Julian Mounter (chief executive of Star) is a very happy man.
He's not sure if it is Christmas or Easter. He was dealing with Pearson.'
Pearson is believed to have offered considerably more than News Corp for the
Star stake. A key factor in the deal may have been an undertaking by Mr
Murdoch to have a public issue of HutchVision shares so Mr Li could sell his
remaining stake if he wished. It was also clear that News Corp would have
found a way of competing against Star if it had failed to buy control.
Hutchison and the Li family will retain 36.4 per cent of the venture and
will remain in control of the company that holds the operating licence from
the Kong Kong government.
This means that unlike Mr Murdoch's Dollars 238.8m bid last month for a 22
per cent stake in Television Broadcasts (TVB), a domestic television company
in Hong Kong, no regulatory issues on ownership are involved.
The TVB deal was withdrawn for consideration in the face of opposition,
partly because Mr Murdoch already owns the highly profitable South China
Morning Post but is still not being ruled out formally by News Corp despite
yesterday's acquisition.
Hutchison and the Li family said the transaction represented six times the
funds which the partners had invested in the satellite venture. This
excludes the money put into Media Assets, a separate company set up to buy
programme rights. Media Assets will now be acquired at cost by HutchVision
for Dollars 64m. Hutchison said it had made an extraordinary gain of
HKDollars 1.5bn (Pounds 129.3m).
Mr Murdoch who has been targeting the Asian television market for some time
made a bid, worth an estimated Dollars 250m, for control of Star some months
ago that was rejected. Although he then made his move on TVB, which has
linked up with Turner Broadcasting and other American broadcasters to
transmit a service on an Indonesian satellite, many believe Star was always
the target.
Star plans to launch a pay television package of channels in October.

FT  27 JUL 93 / Yeltsin softens rouble blow: Widespread chaos and anger as
Russian central bank cancels old notes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR BORIS YELTSIN, the Russian president, yesterday watered down the central
bank's abrupt cancellation of pre-1993 rouble notes, following a wave of
protests by the public, in parliament and from within his own cabinet.
After returning early from a two-week holiday, Mr Yeltsin issued a decree
which moderates but leaves in place Saturday's central bank move to withdraw
all Soviet and Russian notes printed between 1961 and 1992 in Russia and
other former Soviet republics.
The decree raises the amount of cash individuals can exchange from Rbs35,000
(Pounds 23) to Rbs100,000 and extends the period in which this can be done
from August 7 to August 31. It also allows the free exchange of the 10,000
rouble note, even if it bears the 1992 date.
But his decision partially to back the central bank gravely disappointed
reformists in the government, who had earlier in the day hoped that he would
simply annul the ruling.
Mr Yeltsin's move, which failed to heal the widening rift within his own
government, came amid scenes of anger and confusion in the country's
streets. Russians - many elderly - queued at the doors of the savings banks
which had been told to exchange their old roubles. However, many of the
banks stayed closed for the day. At shops and kiosks, old notes were refused
but few had a supply of new notes.
Holidaymakers in Sochi and other Black Sea resorts found themselves unable
to pay hotel bills and fares home, while businesses, both Russian and
foreign, tried unsuccessfully to convert large balances drawn out to meet
their end-of-the-month bills. There were widespread complaints at the
ill-explained, unexpected and confiscatory measure.
Western officials inside and outside Russia also expressed concern at the
growing disarray within the government and its possible impact on Russia's
fragile economic reforms.
There is also concern over the future of the reforms among officials in the
Group of Seven leading industrial nations. The G7 earlier this year agreed a
Dollars 44bn package to assist the Russian economy.
Officials expressed a loss of confidence in a process which had appeared
promising over the past two months, and said there were growing difficulties
about agreeing further tranches of assistance to the authorities in Moscow.
Professor Jeffrey Sachs, the adviser to the Russian government, said that
the central bank's move was 'inexcusable' and reflected a 'Communist
mentality in the leadership'. The action might be 'designed to cover up
corruption'. It 'fundamentally contravenes the trust needed in a nation's
legal tender to achieve macroeconomic stability and to end capital flight'.
Parliament's conservative chairman Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov threatened to
recall parliament to sack any official responsible for the plan unless it
were amended.
Reflecting the deep divisions in the government over the measure, Mr Boris
Fyodorov, the deputy prime minister in charge of finance, demanded yesterday
from Washington that it be annulled. Earlier he called the move a
'Stalinist, socialist' measure.
The bank's move was backed by Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin, the prime minister,
and brusquely announced to his senior ministers on Friday night. There was
no consultation with any finance minister, nor with Mr Yeltsin, nor with the
leaderships of the former Soviet republics which remain within the rouble
zone.
Mr Fyodorov, who returns to Moscow today, faces a critical choice whether to
live with the compromise announced by Mr Yeltsin or continue his fight for
annulment.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Graham Gooch resigned as England cricket captain after Australia won the
fourth Test at Headingley, Leeds, by an innings and 148 runs. The victory
gave Australia a 3-0 lead in the series and assured them of the Ashes, with
two more matches to play. A new captain has yet to be named for the fifth
Test at Edgbaston, Birmingham, which begins on August 5. In a women's World
Cup match at Guildford, Surrey, England beat Australia by 43 runs.

FT  27 JUL 93 / Belgium, Portugal defend currencies in ERM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE EUROPEAN exchange rate mechanism continued to come under heavy strain
yesterday, with the central banks of Belgium and Portugal raising short-term
interest rates to defend their currencies and the French franc remaining
close to its floor against the D-Mark in the European monetary system.
Neither the Bank of France nor the Bundesbank intervened in currency markets
yesterday to support the French franc, in marked contrast to their
operations at the end of last week in which they bought francs for D-Marks
in huge quantities.
However, no early end to the crisis over the franc was in sight, and two
other currencies - the Danish krone and the Spanish peseta - also came under
heavy selling pressure.
Foreign exchange dealers said the immediate fate of the French currency  -
and perhaps of Europe's semi-fixed exchange rate system as a whole - would
rest on the results of Thursday's Bundesbank council meeting.
The German authorities will come under strong pressure to cut their official
interest rates to allow other European countries to do the same. Currency
analysts and dealers believed the Bundesbank would have to cut its discount
rate by at least  1/2 a percentage point this week - to 6.25 per cent - to
stem the crisis.
The Belgian authorities were forced to raise their seven-day advances rate
from 6.7 per cent to 8.5 per cent after the Belgian franc came under strong
selling pressure in the morning. The central bank of Portugal also raised
its liquidity mop-up rate from 10.25 per cent to 13.39 per cent after heavy
selling of the escudo last week.
Belgium's move helped to restore the franc to a close of BFr20.73 against
the D-Mark after it had been at BFr20.78 earlier in the day. But some
analysts suggested that the heavy selling of the currency implied that some
dealers believed the ERM might collapse.
The French franc closed in London at FFr3.414 to the D-Mark from a previous
FFr3.416. It was little changed in New York yesterday and in early trading
in Tokyo today.

FT  27 JUL 93 / Reuters to spend Pounds 350m of cash pile on share buy-back
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
REUTERS, the international news and information group, is to spend up to
Pounds 350m buying back its own shares in the largest repurchase operation
by a British company since the mid-1980s. News of the plan, under which
Reuters would take back 5.8 per cent of its equity, sent the shares up 36p
to Pounds 14.40.
Reuters, which had planned to unveil the scheme today with its interim
results, said it had been obliged to bring forward the announcement by press
speculation.
Shareholders will receive Pounds 14 a share, but tax credits will make it
worth as much as Pounds 17.25 to tax-exempt gross income funds. The tax
credits mean individual shareholders will receive Pounds 16.25, but that
will be subject to capital gains and income tax.
Reuters has been piling up cash over the last few years and had a balance of
Pounds 710m at its December year-end. It promised in March to consider ways
of returning cash to shareholders - either by a special dividend or share
buy-back. Sir Christopher Hogg, chairman, said: 'Whilst the main purpose of
the repurchase is to provide shareholders with the opportunity either to
receive a cash distribution or to have an equivalent enhancement of their
investment in Reuters, the board believes that all shareholders will benefit
from the repurchase since it should lead to an increase in Reuters' earnings
per share.'
In what Reuters described as a 'pioneering scheme', the 34 per cent of the
group's equity held as American Depositary Shares will also receive a UK tax
refund. The tax credit arises because the Inland Revenue views such cash
distributions as dividends, on which advance corporation tax is payable but
may be reclaimed.
All shareholders will be entitled to sell 5.8 per cent of their holding,
although they will be able to sell more, to the extent that other
shareholders do not take up their full entitlement.
Sir Christopher said: 'The difference between a special dividend and
buy-back are quite marked on closer examination. We like this scheme because
it gives shareholders a choice - they can either take the cash, or have an
enhanced stake in the company.'
Mr Peter Job, chief executive, said: 'We have absorbed two messages from
shareholders - they want us to continue to invest in the business, but they
don't want us to invest just for the sake of investing.'

FT  26 JUL 93 / VW jigsaw begins to clatter into place
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SOME of the links necessary to support General Motors' charges that its
former global purchasing chief and a group of his associates took industrial
secrets with them when they departed for Volkswagen clattered into place
last week.
After revealing that Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, now VW's production
director, had a personal hand in the collection of some of the GM documents
found in the former German home of two of his fellow defectors, public
prosecutors made plain the next stage.
'The investigations will continue, with special attention to the examination
of witnesses from the Volkswagen group,' they said last Thursday.
The aim now is to try to seal the links, and extend the chain of evidence
and circumstances. Mr Ferdinand Piech, group chairman and scion of the rich
and influential Porsche family, has consistently denied all allegations of
espionage, conspiracy or any other suspicions.
Mr Gerhard Schroder, representing VW's biggest shareholder by virtue of his
post as prime minister of Lower Saxony, which owns 20 per cent of the group,
has repeatedly claimed it is all a commercial 'campaign'. He argues that GM,
a 'foreign' company, is peeved at the loss of Mr Lopez, an inspired and
inspiring manager, and is out for retribution.
Mr Schroder, who met Mr Piech at a crisis meeting last Friday, is likely to
keep his counsel in future. After last week's legal setbacks, and evidence
of a popular swing of opinion in favour of GM's standpoint, VW needs a
rather more professional approach to its public statements. According to a
poll from the re-spected Forsa institute in Dortmund, 65 per cent of Germans
believe there is 'something in' the US group's charges.
This view has been encouraged by apparently ambivalent press statements from
VW. There was no reason for Mr Lopez to resign 'at this point", a spokesman
said last week. The group's official response to the state prosecutors'
revelations about the papers found in Wiesbaden also appeared to lack
conviction.
The tide of opinion and prima facie evidence appears to have turned against
VW. The prosecutors are now believed to be working their way through
interviews with VW employees. Starting with established members of staff,
they are searching for evidence that GM data, whether on paper, computer
disks or via electronic transmissions was filtered into VW's Wolfsburg
headquarters.
At the end of the list of interviewees stand the four former GM men, all of
whom have already signed statements or affidavits that they neither took
secrets from their old employer nor delivered them to their new one. They
are on annual leave at present and not due back until early August, although
all the signs at the weekend were that they were likely to be called back
early.

FT  26 JUL 93 / France's own Euro-sceptics: Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN DAVIDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The melodramatic scenes of confusion, ambiguity, double-dealing and uproar,
in which the parliamentary ratification of the Maastricht treaty was finally
brought to a end in the British House of Commons last week, provided a
fitting conclusion to a political process which has been as unedifying as it
has been prolonged.
Some people may think that the government's never-ending succession of
defeats, retreats and ambiguous victories was just the unfortunate
consequence of the weakness of the prime minister and of his paper-thin
majority in parliament. Yet this lamentable political spectacle, so far from
being an accident, may in fact be an accurate representation of attitudes in
the government, in the House and among the people.
In any case, Mr John Major brought on his own head last week's melodramatic
denouement, since he deliberately set up the conditions which maximised the
risks both to himself and to the treaty. When he insisted on a special
status for Britain outside the social chapter of Maastricht, he made it easy
for his opponents to argue that the treaty could be changed after all; he
gave them the choice of alternative battlegrounds, on which to form
opportunistic alliances against him.
Even now, it is difficult to make out why Mr Major insisted so hard on
staying out of the social chapter. He argues vehemently that greater job
protection for workers would in fact destroy jobs. But does he seriously
expect the other 11 member states to rush ahead with restrictive new
employment laws, just at a time when unemployment is so high and still
rising?
Is it that he shares that strange traditional British prejudice, that
foreigners do not understand economics? Does he assume that their political
behaviour is wholly irrational? Or was this just gesture politics addressed
to his own backbenchers? Was he opting out of some bits of the Maastricht
treaty, any bits, it didn't much matter which, mainly in order to
demonstrate a suitable determination to maintain an arm's-length
independence from Brussels?
The Maastricht treaty debate has stirred up fierce nationalistic passions,
largely inspired by wild phantasms of some kind of mega-state run from
Brussels. Instead of dispelling these irrational fears, the government has
actually encouraged them by appeasement.
However, the British case needs to be seen in a broader European
perspective. France has in recent years always been at the forefront of
initiatives to press Europe forward; and opinion polls have showed large and
steady majorities in favour of the Community. But even in France the
Maastricht treaty stirred up fierce opposition from nationalists. The
government only won its popular referendum by the narrowest of margins; and
the passionate debates of the parliamentary phase of ratification showed
that quite a large minority of Conservative deputies, especially among the
Gaullists, were unconditionally hostile to the proposed development of the
Community model of Europe.
The anti-Community minority on the Gaullist benches is now much larger, as a
result of the Conservative landslide in the March general elections; and it
is not clear that the government led by Mr Edouard Balladur is going to be
able to keep it under control. On the contrary, the large government
majority may well fall apart ahead of next spring's elections to the
European Parliament, and it may even split three ways; and there is already
intermittent sniping by nationalist Gaullists against the government's
economic policy, which is an indirect way of attacking the Maastricht
treaty.
The government will almost certainly face a breakaway challenge from former
president Valery Giscard d'Estaing, who seems determined to lead his own UDF
party in the European elections next year, since this would give him a dry
run for another go at the presidential elections in 1995. It is partly to
deflect him that Mr Balladur has offered to head a single Conservative list
of candidates; but his other motive is to prevent the ultra-nationalists in
the Gaullist party from fielding a separate anti-European list of
candidates.
Mr Philippe Seguin, a leading Gaullist nationalist, has already started
attacking the government's franc fort policy, with its emphasis on low
inflation and resulting high interest rates, and has called for 'another',
more growth-oriented, policy.
Such a change in stance might help reduce unemployment; it would certainly
further undermine the Maastricht programme for monetary union. By himself,
however, Mr Seguin is probably no more than a nuisance; more worrying for Mr
Balladur is that Jacques Chirac, leader of the Gaullists, has ostentatiously
failed to denounce Mr Seguin.
There are two differences between Britain and France. The first is that the
Gaullists who opposed Maastricht were more numerous than the British
Euro-sceptics, because nationalism is, after all, the dimly remembered
ideology that once underlay Gaullism; whereas British Tories would deny
anything as coherent as an ideology.
Second, the entire middle ground of the French political and administrative
establishment is a whole order of magnitude more pro-Community than their
counterparts in Britain. If the franc were blown out of the exchange rate
mechanism, it is virtually inconceivable that any French finance minister
would boast that it made him sing in the bath; on the contrary, any French
government one can imagine would regard it as a major political and European
crisis, calling for urgent remedial action at European level.

FT  26 JUL 93 / Shifting up the economic gears: America
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The US economy is not booming, but it is in much better shape than is
generally appreciated. The near-stalling of growth in the first quarter was
an aberration, reflecting a confluence of special factors including a plunge
in defence outlays, an east coast blizzard and temporary retrenchment by
consumers after a spending spree at the end of 1992.
Figures for gross domestic product this week are likely to confirm that the
economy expanded at an annual rate of close to 3 per cent in the second
quarter. It may do better still in the second half, assuming congressional
negotiators quickly reach agreement on a deficit-cutting economic plan, thus
putting an end to debilitating uncertainty about future tax rates.
One reason for optimism is the marked improvement in the financial health of
banks, businesses and families following the decline in short- and long-term
interest rates to the lowest levels in two decades.
According to federal regulators, more than two-thirds of US banks are now
'well-capitalised', double the proportion at the end of 1991; only one in 10
is now reckoned to be short of capital. Bank share prices have soared and
the sector is earning near-record profits.
Companies and individuals have retired or refinanced large quantities of
debt, reducing debt service burdens to the relatively manageable levels of
the mid-1980s. By the standards of previous decades, balance sheets are
still quite strained, but the economy seems to be wriggling free from the
financial vice that stymied growth during most of the Bush presidency.
The inability of Congress and the White House to provide the customary
post-recession fiscal stimulus, meanwhile, is proving a blessing in
disguise. Most postwar US recoveries have been led by consumer and
government spending. This time the corporate sector is making the running.
Capital investment is surging following an increase in corporate profits of
about 35 per cent since the recession and the most encouraging productivity
trends in more than a decade.
Business equipment investment grew at an annual rate of 18 per cent in real
terms in the first quarter, after an increase of more than 12 per cent
during 1992; another healthy gain seems likely in the second quarter. The
sharp fall in computer prices makes the figures slightly suspect: it is hard
to believe that the volume of expenditure on computers and related equipment
has really doubled since early 1991. But there can be no doubt that
corporate America is moving swiftly to reap efficiency gains from advances
in information-processing technologies. Other types of capital investment
are also strong; even commercial real estate markets are showing signs of
stabilising.
And although the conventional measures of consumer confidence are still
falling, consumers have returned to the shopping malls. Retail sales grew at
an annual rate of about 5 per cent in real terms in the second quarter. The
most encouraging sign was a surge in spending on large discretionary items,
such as cars and furniture. Vehicle sales have recently been running at an
annual rate of about 14.5m units, the highest rate since before the
recession.
There are, of course, still plenty of negative forces at work. Under Mr
Clinton the contraction of defence industries is accelerating, with serious
adverse consequences for many sectors and regions. Ironically, if the
administration succeeds in pushing through radical healthcare reform, it may
inflict a blow of similar magnitude to the service sector. Healthcare is one
of the few parts of the economy where employment has grown steadily in
recent years. The weakness of the international economy is an added
headache: although exports remain remarkably resilient, they are no longer
capable of providing extra lift as in the late 1980s.
And while Mr Clinton's election victory was initially greeted with euphoria,
the transfer of executive power from Republicans to Democrats has involved
added economic uncertainty. Companies accustomed to the Republicans' broadly
free-market approach are having to adjust to a different climate in
Washington. They know income and corporate taxes are going up, but not when
or by how much. They are also deeply concerned that payroll taxes will rise
substantially to finance healthcare reform and, perhaps, new training
requirements.
All this has hindered job creation. Employment has only just regained its
pre-recession peak, and a quarter of the 2m new jobs created in the past two
years are temporary positions - an unheard of proportion during a recovery
phase.
On balance, however, the pluses greatly outweigh the minuses. As Mr Alan
Greenspan, Federal Reserve chairman, stressed in congressional testimony
last week, the global pace of economic change is accelerating. Capital
equipment is becoming redundant faster than ever before; in some markets,
products that were at the cutting edge of technology five years ago are now
unsaleable. In a fast-changing world, America's entrepreneurial spirit and
flexible labour markets constitute a powerful comparative advantage. Mr
Greenspan used words such as 'vibrant' and 'dynamic' to describe the type of
economy that seems to be emerging from the restructuring chrysalis of the
early 1990s. If he was exaggerating, it was only by a whisker.

FT  26 JUL 93 / Monday Interview: Doctrine of choice and sacrifice - John
Gummer, UK environment secretary
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'THE JOB of the environment secretary is to win environmental goals,'
according to Mr John Gummer. With less than two months in the job, and no
easy goals in sight, it is clear that he faces a tough game.
The UK environment secretary's sprawling portfolio includes local government
and planning issues as well as 'green' questions. Last week provided Mr
Gummer with a reminder, if he needed one, that his environmental brief
threatens to give him some particularly nasty headaches.
The transport department's decision to widen the M25 motorway around London
to 14 lanes on its busiest section, against the vigorous protests of most of
Britain's green lobby, showed that conflicts are looming between the
environment and other government departments.
The Maastricht turmoil also reflects Britain's ambivalence over European
environmental regulation. Britain has called for tougher enforcement of some
EC directives. But ministers have also questioned whether water standards
are too demanding, and are resisting tightening acid rain targets as much as
their European neighbours would like, a move that could saddle Britain once
again with the tag 'the dirty man of Europe'.
More widely, industrialists are questioning whether environmental regulation
is a further layer of costs which the UK cannot afford and which could
jeopardise recovery.
Environmentalists, who have been sceptical of Mr Gummer's clout within the
cabinet, fear that his department will be on the losing side of any
ministerial tussles. Pressure groups have also been unsure of how his
pronounced views on many subjects - he resigned from the General Synod of
the Church of England last year over the issue of admitting women to the
priesthood - would translate into environmental policy. They feel he gave
few clues to his instincts as agriculture minister: they welcomed his
opposition to commercial whaling but felt he kept quiet on farms' pollution
of rivers.
Since he took the environment job, Mr Gummer has shown a campaigning
enthusiasm and a notion of direct action to match that of the pressure
groups. He has promised to plunge into the chilly, brownish seas off
Blackpool beach during the Tory party conference in the autumn in response
to the European Court of Justice's ruling that the water failed to meet EC
standards.
The roots of his environmentalist beliefs have also become clearer. 'It
isn't our planet,' he says: 'We didn't deserve it and we've been lucky
enough to inherit it.' He declines to answer whose planet he thinks it is -
his aides say he is scrupulous at not bringing religion into the office -
but claims authorship of Mrs Thatcher's now-famous phrase that the present
generation has no freehold on the planet, only a 'repairing lease'.
He believes those obligations entail sacrifices and now admits to 'a degree
of guilt, fighting battles for preservation of the whales - vast numbers of
people who wrote in were doing so because there was no downside for them'.
Mr Gummer places himself among those Tories who see conservation as a
central part of Conservative philosophy. 'These are fundamental views about
inheritance, continuity and handing on.'
At the top of his environmental priorities is atmospheric pollution,
particularly global warming and depletion of the ozone layer, 'two things
which I have to be a missionary about'. He says he thinks 'spending money on
the reduction of carbon dioxide (implicated in global warming) and sulphur
(a cause of acid rain) is more important' than rival claims such as water
quality.
Such priorities threaten to bring him into conflict with transport and
energy policies. Traffic pollution is one of the most intractable sources of
carbon dioxide, while coal-burning power stations generate most of Britain's
sulphur emissions.
'It is manifestly obvious that if you go on increasing the number of cars at
the rate we are doing between now and the end of the century you are going
to put more emission into the air than you can possibly bear,' Mr Gummer
says.
But while he declines to criticise the M25 decision, he adds: 'I am very
pleased that the minister of transport made the decision (not to put a new
highway through Oxleas Wood).' Asked why he did not air those views
publicly, he responds: 'If you are a minister you swap the advantage of
public statement for the considerable influence of private discussion.'
So far, his department's enthusiasm for tighter international sulphur
targets to be negotiated in Geneva next month has been reined back by the
department of trade and industry, which is anxious to preserve power
stations' demand for British coal. However, on nuclear energy, Mr Gummer is
likely to win a respite from the battle - the two departments could find
themselves in harmony.
A well-known supporter of nuclear power - he backed Sizewell B, which is in
his constituency - he says: 'There is a very strong environmental case for
nuclear power', because it emits no carbon or sulphur.
However, his judicial role in deciding the future of the controversial Thorp
plant at Sellafield shields him from having to comment on whether
reprocessing adds to the costs of nuclear power. Some in the nuclear
industry say privately that the costs of Thorp, if it is given the go-ahead,
will diminish the case for nuclear electricity, to be debated in this
autumn's nuclear review.
Other lower-profile battles loom: his consultation document last week on
sustainable development suggested he would take a hard look at the need for
recycling of building materials, an unwelcome move to the construction
industry. Environment department officials have tended, urged on by Treasury
colleagues, to regard the construction industry as out of bounds while
economic recovery is fragile.
In fighting these battles for environment policy, the charge most likely to
be thrown at Mr Gummer is the cost of going green. He says he accepts that
cleaning up the environment 'is tremendously expensive. It may mean that you
have to produce things or dispose of your effluent in a more expensive way'.
In sentiments unlikely to endear him to industrialists, he adds: 'Industry
has to realise that from now on 'the polluter pays' principle is becoming
the natural way of making law.'
Part of his answer to cost concerns is to set priorities for spending more
carefully, and in some cases to rethink environmental commitments. He
professes considerable sympathy for the case put by Mr Ian Byatt,
director-general of Ofwat, the water regulator, that water investment is
progressing too fast.
'I don't necessarily want to change the standards although there are some
which in retrospect would be the wrong ones,' but he questions 'the
timetable and frontloading' of the industry's spending programmes, which
could total Pounds 45bn this decade.
He argues, too, that there is an 'enormous business in environmental
technology'. This argument was employed by his predecessor, Mr Michael
Howard, and is often used by Conservative politicians to bridge the gap
between conservation instincts and a reluctance to hamstring industry.
However, many companies are sceptical that they derive any competitive
benefits from environmental investment.
Mr Gummer points to the growth of the water technology industry. He says he
gets support for his belief from 'even the simplest things' such as the
adoption of water-saving devices in urinals: 'Now it doesn't flush except
when it needs to flush. That's a huge water-saving activity, and many of
these machines are made in Britain - it's an important element of what we're
doing.'
To win the tough battles ahead he needs to convince other departments and
industrialists that the environment is a bearable and worthwhile cost. He
also needs to convince regulators and environmentalists that not all their
aspirations can be met. This can only be done by setting priorities. 'I want
to use this period when the environment isn't absolutely the top of the
agenda to try to get a degree of realism.'

FT  26 JUL 93 / Foreign Exchange and Money Markets: ERM in the balance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHANIE FLANDERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN markets will be preoccupied this week by whether the Bundesbank
will reduce official German interest rates at Thursday's council meeting,
writes Stephanie Flanders.
As far as many observers are concerned, the French franc cannot maintain its
current position in the European exchange rate mechanism without lower real
interest rates, and the mechanism itself cannot survive without the French.
Last week's renewed speculative pressure was driven by disappointing German
monetary figures, which seemed to lower the chances of a cut in German
interest rates on Thursday.
The latest German cost of living figures, due out this week, are unlikely to
paint a more optimistic picture for a Bundesbank monetary loosening. But if
ERM central banks cannot restrain further speculation in the run-up to the
Bundesbank meeting, many argue that the usual rules for predicting German
monetary policy may not apply.
Even if German interest rates are lowered slightly on Thursday, some doubt
whether this will be enough for a number of beleaguered member countries.
French unemployment figures for June, released on Friday, will be an early
focus of attention for dogged anti-franc speculators.
Similarly, Spanish quarterly jobless data, due out during the week, is
likely to intensify recent attacks on the peseta, with or without a German
interest rate cut.
Once again, events outside the ERM will probably receive less than the usual
market attention this week. But it will be hard to ignore some important
economic figures coming out of the US.
In particular, tomorrow's consumer confidence index for July and Thursday's
advance estimate for second quarter real GDP will test the chairman of the
Federal Reserve's optimistic prognosis on the state of the American recovery
in his testimony before Congress last week.

FT  26 JUL 93 / The Week Ahead: Results due
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ON Thursday, Imperial Chemical Industries, the UK's largest chemical group,
reports its first interim results without its bioscience business, Zeneca.
Industry analysts' forecasts reckon pre-tax profits will be down from last
year's Pounds 159m (excluding exceptionals) to about Pounds 140m. Figures
will also be given for the old ICI, which included Zeneca.
Cost-cutting should yield some significant savings and the results will have
benefited from a weak pound.
The performance of the industrial chemicals division will also be closely
watched. Its titanium dioxide and caustic businesses are struggling but
chemicals and polymers are expected to post significant improvements.
Zeneca, ICI's former bioscience business, also reports its half-year results
on Thursday. Analysts expect it to report pre-tax profits at between Pounds
330m and Pounds 340m. Of particular interest will be the performance of the
pharmaceuticals division.
The extent of the decline of Tenormin, once Zeneca's best- selling drug
before its patents expired in the US, will be watched carefully, as will the
growth of the four growth products - Zestril, a heart drug, the cancer
products Zoladex and Nolvadex, and the anaesthetic Diprivan.
Some analysts are predicting an unexpected upturn in the agrochemicals
division, after Monsanto this week reported a significant increase in sales
of its herbicide Roundup in the US. Reuters, the international information
and news group, is expected to report an increase in interim pre-tax profits
from Pounds 187m to about Pounds 210m tomorrow. Interest will centre on
whether the group plans to distribute some of its Pounds 710m cash pile to
shareholshareholders - and on the progress of new dealing systems such as
Globex, which serves financial futures and options markets, and Dealing
2000-2, the group's automated foreign exchange product.
BAT Industries, the tobacco to insurance conglomerate, is expected to show
increased interim pre-tax profits on Wednesday. Despite concerns about the
prospects for the group's US tobacco business, profits are predicted to rise
to Pounds 710m-Pounds 780m (Pounds 672m a year earlier). Eagle Star, the
non-life insurance subsidiary, is gradually recovering profitability.
The interim reporting season for clearing banks starts on Friday with
Lloyds, which is expected to show less of a rebound in profits than other
banks because of greater consistency in earnings in the past two years.
Lloyds is also expected to be under some pressure in its net interest income
because its UK loan book has been contracting. But analysts expect it to
benefit from around Pounds 100m of release of less developed country debt.
Analysts expect a rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds 450m-Pounds 560m (Pounds
369m). Provisions for bad and doubtful debts are expected to fall to between
Pounds 250m and Pounds 270m from Pounds 347m.
British Telecommunications is reporting first quarter results on Wednesday.
Pre-tax profits will be around Pounds 780m (Pounds 731m), according to our
forecast.

FT  26 JUL 93 / Economics: More bad news for France
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FRIDAY WILL be an uncomfortable day for the French government with the
release of unemployment statistics for June. The expected rise in the rate
of unemployment to 11.6 per cent comes at a time when the government is
under pressure to ease monetary policy, but is prevented from doing so
because of its commitment to keeping the franc at its current value against
other European currencies.
Until Germany eases its interest rates, short of leaving the European
exchange rate mechanism, it appears that the French government will have to
preside over the unpopular combination of high unemployment and high real
interest rates.
There will be no easing of pressure on the UK government this week. Although
strong economic statistics are working in the government's favour - the
Confederation of British Industry's industrial trends survey tomorrow is
expected to confirm a steady economic recovery - the Conservative party
looks set to lose the Christchurch by-election on Thursday.

The figures in brackets are the median of economists' forecasts from MMS
International, a financial information company.

Canada, June industrial production price index (up 0.1 per cent on month),
raw materials price index (down 0.6 per cent on month). Australia, Q2
consumer prices index (up 0.5 per cent on quarter, up 2 per cent on year).

FT  26 JUL 93 / Risk and Reward: Watchdog growls at the door of the swaps
dealing community
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Question: When is a Dollars 4,000bn monster really a Dollars 144bn pussycat?
Answer: When the international swaps dealing community realises that its
self-promotional enthusiasm has attracted a regulatory wolf to its door.
The International Swaps and Derivatives Association, the trade group that
represents derivatives market participants, has made a great effort in the
last five years to let the world know that derivatives' trading has become a
huge and vitally important business.
'Derivatives' is a catch-all term that usually represents contracts or
securities whose values are pegged to traditional financial products like
shares and bonds.
As well as standardised contracts such as futures, traded on exchanges, a
market in over-the-counter derivatives, mainly swaps, has been developed
among banks and securities firms. These are products specially tailored to
suit the needs of the end-user, and the market has proved highly profitable
for many participants, whom ISDA represents.
In an interest rate swap, one party swaps the cash flow of floating-rate
liabilities for a counterparty's fixed-rate liabilities. Swap dealers act as
match-makers, finding suitable counterparties or acting as counterparties
themselves.
Estimates of market size, supplied by ISDA, grew from Dollars 2,000bn to
Dollars 4,000bn in notional value between 1991 and 1992, while the US
Federal Reserve recently said the figure could be a high as Dollars 7,000bn.
Regulators have become concerned about such large amounts of money exposed
in novel ways to credit, settlement, market, and systemic risks. The natural
response by regulators was to take a good look at the products, and
determine if they needed to checked.
The dealing community realised too late the mistake it had made, and began
back-pedaling rapidly. It organised its own study of the market, under the
cloak of the Washington-based think-tank, the Group of 30, to demystify and
deflate the scope of derivatives trading.
'By any measure,' the G30 report said, 'derivatives are a major financial
activity. Some have even portrayed it as a multi-trillion dollar business
dwarfing activity in other financial markets. But a more careful comparison
reveals that, while derivatives activity is growing rapidly, its size
remains modest in relation to foreign exchange, bonds, or equities.' One
ISDA board member admits that: 'It was probably a mistake to have focused on
notional value (amount of the total assets) of derivatives. Notional value
means nothing in relation to capital risked in derivatives trades. It has
backfired on us.'
To follow up on the G30 report, ISDA plans to publish 'marked to market'
derivatives values in the future. These figures represent only the capital
risked in a derivatives deal, and should amount to less than 5 per cent of
notional value.
A G30 report supplement puts market value of all over-the-counter
derivatives positions at the 50 largest US bank holding companies in 1992 at
only Dollars 144bn - or about 11 per cent of bank assets.
Whether this slimming act will deflect regulators' concerns remains to be
seen. ISDA members will convene in New York this week to discuss the G30
report and its recommendations, which lean heavily on sound management
practices.
Despite the conclusion by Mr Paul Volker, G30 chairman, that no new
regulations are needed for derivatives trading, dealers know that important
new constraints are already in the pipeline and could have a significant
impact on how they do business.

FT  26 JUL 93 / International Bonds: Sterling convertible bonds return to
favour
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE POUND'S reversal of fortune in recent months has provided a welcome
boost for sterling-denominated convertible bonds. As last week's successful
Pounds 91m convertible bond issue from SG Warburg Group demonstrated,
continental European investors are avid buyers of Eurosterling equity-linked
paper: they are keen on the currency, feel they have protection on the
downside, and they expect to see a recovery in the stock market performance
in a few months' time.
How things have changed. Less than a year ago, sterling was branded the
black sheep of the European exchange rate mechanism as repeated attempts to
support the pound failed, leading to sterling's ignominious departure from
the ERM last September. That left the Bank of England free to cut interest
rates quite dramatically with the result that the yield curve shifted from
inverted to positive. Since then, sterling has enjoyed a revival from
overseas investors either looking for the currency to appreciate or, in more
recent times, regarding it as a safe haven while other ERM currencies take a
buffeting.
The fall in interest rates has meant that UK companies have been able to
issue convertible bonds with much lower coupons than circumstances would
have dictated a year ago - hence the flood of equity-linked offerings from
names such as Inchcape (the UK-based motor and business-services group),
Sedgwick (the insurance broker), P&amp;O (the transport group), and Yorkshire
Water.
'From the investors' point of view, they may be dropping a bit in bond yield
when they buy a convertible bond (as opposed to a straight bond), but they
expect in six or 12-months' time to be riding on the back of a very strong
equity market as the recovery in the UK economy takes off,' says one
convertible bond specialist.
A fund manager at a French bank says: 'We've been very positive on these
convertible bond issues: we like the quality of the paper, the pricings were
in line with the market, we're positive on the pound and we're positive on
the stock market.'
The string of successes was interrupted by Allied-Lyons, the drinks, food
and retailing group, which launched a Pounds 200m, 15-year convertible bond
issue in May. The deal was deemed a flop at the time, with many claiming it
had been mispriced, although the price has since recovered. Some felt at the
time that that failure might dent demand for further issues although that
has not proved the case.
Indeed, one of the market's talking points is who might come next. There are
rumours that one of the power or electricity companies might launch a
convertible bond shortly. Equity-linked experts point out that some of the
banks would be suitable candidates given that they are seen as 'recovery
plays', like the insurance companies which have already tapped the sterling
convertible bond sector. 'There are some deals in the pipeline, but perhaps
they are looking for that extra interest rate cut before they go ahead,'
says one analyst.
There is also plenty of discussion about the trend in coupons, which have
been in the range of 6.25 per cent (for Inchcape) to say 7.25 per cent (for
Sedgwick). For Swiss and other continental investors, these coupons are
still seen as attractive. Recent issues have tended to come at the lower end
of the indicated coupon range, and the higher end of the indicated
conversion premium range. Some convertible bond experts wonder whether the
next issuer will be able to breach the 6 per cent coupon level.
'I think to break through 6 per cent you would need to have a really good,
top ten name, and it would be difficult, especially since short-term
interest rates have edged up a touch,' argues one equity-linked specialist
while conceding that 'the temptation for the borrower to push through 6 per
cent must be overwhelming'.
Another expert argues: 'You certainly could get a coupon of below 6 per
cent, but investors are generally yield-hungry so in terms of the market we
know that deals go better with a higher coupon.'

FT  26 JUL 93 / UK Gilts: Buyers retreat as air of excitement evaporates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ATMOSPHERE of excite-ment which has suffused the gilts market,
particularly at the long end, showed signs of abating last week.
Enthusiastic buyers, particularly overseas investors who have pushed yields
to new lows recently, have begun to feel that they had had enough excitement
for the time being. There are several powerful reasons for this.
Firstly, recent economic data has been disturbingly buoyant with retail
sales rising and exports outside the EC making a strong showing. This was
compounded by a 0.5 per cent gain for gross domestic product in the second
quarter, suggesting that the UK might see 2 per cent growth this year.
Second, there is the increasingly unpredictable political situation ahead of
the Christchurch by-election and following the Government's defeat on
Thursday in its vote on the social chapter of the Maastricht treaty.
Finally, the supply arguments are starting to look authorative. Another huge
government bond auction takes place on Wednesday, adding Pounds 3.25bn worth
of stock maturing in 2001.
Yields within the five to 10-year range rose quite sharply last week and the
very short-dated maturities were relatively firm. But the long end of the
yield curve was barely changed with 8.75 per cent stock dated 2017 still
offering less than 8 per cent by the close of dealing on Friday.
However, as Mr Roger Bootle, chief economist at Midland Global Markets,
says: 'The characteristics of this market astound those who haven't taken on
the low inflationary view.'
It is that growing confidence in the long-term economic fundamentals of the
UK, particularly the belief in steady growth combined with low inflation,
that inspires most economists to believe in a continuation of the downward
trend in long-dated yields.
Mr Bootle sees long yields hitting 7.75 per cent by the end of the year. He
is also confident that base rates can fall by another point within the same
period - and possibly by as much as another three points - which would bring
down short-dated yields.
At SG Warburg Securities, economist Mr Kit Juckes is equally confident that
rates will fall further, arguing that the Maastricht vote tension only
increases that likelihood. 'Worried politicians are rate cut politicians,'
he says.
Gilts have reflected that confidence. Every time there is a dip in prices,
buyers return and push the price back up. Gilts were dented by the high
street sales figures and early political worries but they fought back later,
and after a gut reaction on Friday morning they largely ignored the
government's defeat.
The consensus, therefore, is that the market will continue onwards and
upwards - but not just yet. The government faces a by-election this week and
is unlikely to ease beforehand. And, overseas investors could start to take
profits over the next few days.
Longer term, however, a more cautious view is expressed by Mr Ian Harnett,
economist at Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull. 'Despite inflation at a
30-year low, we remain sceptical about the ability of the government to
deliver non-inflationary growth,' he says.

FT  26 JUL 93 / US Money and Credit: Rally threatens to run out of steam
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOTH ends of the US yield curve were given a firm tug upwards last week,
ending a period of equanimity in short-term interest rates and putting paid
to the seemingly inexorable march of long-term rates to ever-lower levels.
Just a temporary setback, or the beginning of the end for the bond market's
prolonged rally? The answer could become clearer this week, as the latest
batch of economic data - including provisional gross domestic product for
the second quarter - reveals just how fast the recovery is proceeding.
It was not difficult to see why short-term yields rose. Appearing before the
House Banking Committee on Tuesday to deliver his biannual Humphrey-Hawkins
testimony, Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, surprised the
bond market with what was taken to be a warning that interest rates would
have to go up in the near future.
The bond market had allowed itself to be reassured by the inflation data for
the last two months. But Mr Greenspan was having none of it: consumer price
inflation had stabilised at around 3 per cent, he said. With Federal funds
at the same level, real interest rates were effectively zero - a level that
was not sustainable indefinitely. The level of real interest rates has been
upgraded by the Fed as an economic indicator, he said, along with other
indicators like the price of gold (which has bounced back from its
seven-year low this spring). The significance of money supply data had been
downgraded. Mr Greenspan's change in emphasis hurt short-dated paper: by the
end of the week, the yield on two-year Treasury bills had risen by some 25
basis points, to 4.2 per cent.
Mr Greenspan's inflation-bashing comments should have given heart to the
long end of the bond market. Instead, they were taken as an excuse for a
round of profit-taking: a 6.5 per cent yield had been seen by many as
marking the floor for long-term bond yields, and this seemed as good an
excuse as any to lock in some of the gains of recent weeks. From a yield a
week before of 6.54 per cent, the long bond had widened out to 6.7 per cent
at the end of last week.
The progress of the Clinton administration's deficit-reduction package, and
the prospect of a deluge of new bonds from companies, municipals and the
federal government, were also hanging heavily over the long bond. Hopes that
a compromise deficit-reduction bill between the Senate and Congress would be
stitched together before the August recess were damaged by a gathering
corruption scandal that threatens to engulf Mr Dan Rostenkowski, a key
Democrat negotiator in the process.
Meanwhile, companies lined up to lock in to low long-term rates while they
were still around. Disney and Coca-Cola led the charge down the yield curve,
producing the first 100-year bonds in the US for nearly four decades.
Companies tapped the markets for nearly Dollars 10bn during the week, double
the level of the week before.
It all added up to a good reason for investors to sell bonds. But how far
will the market retreat? Data this week is expected to maintain the positive
tone that has supported bonds for so long. Provisional GDP figures for the
second quarter on Thursday are expected to show the economy recovering
steadily after its first-quarter slowdown, at around 2.5 per cent. In the
midst of last week's slide, at least one thing remained constant: the yield
curve flattened further, a sign that inflationary expectations are gradually
being squeezed out of the market. The gap between two and 30-year bond
yields narrowed by around 15 basis points, to 250 basis points. That at
least is some comfort for holders of the long bond.

FT  26 JUL 93 / European Bonds: Prospects depend on the ERM's fate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONCE again, the prospects for European bond markets are bound up with the
fate of the exchange rate mechanism, which many economists and investors
think will stand or fall depending on events this week, or over the next few
weeks.
The first test is the release of German inflation figures for July, which
are due to be announced today, although there were market rumours on Friday
that their release could be delayed, because of fears over market reaction.
'If the figures are bad, the ERM will be attacked with renewed force,' said
Ms Alison Cottrell, international economist at Midland Global Markets.
A deterioration following last month's inflation figure of 4.2 per cent is
expected, but a substantial worsening will make it harder for the Bundesbank
to offer more than a token easing of German interest rates. Analysts say
that at this stage in the crisis a substantial easing of German rates,
perhaps as much as a full point, is needed to have any real stabilising
effect on the currencies still in the ERM.
Market participants will be watching for a move to ease rates at both the
repo early in the week and the Bundesbank council meeting on Thursday, the
last before council members break for a month (although the Bundesbank could
still ease other rates).
Even if the Germans do cut rates this week, the ERM still faces further
potential pressure at the beginning of August, when a series of German
economic data including production and employment are due.
Some analysts believe that under these conditions the ERM has become
untenable.
'The shelf-life of the ERM is pretty limited,' said Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief
economist at Citibank, who argues that it is not feasible to maintain
interest rates at double-digit levels when there is double-digit
unemployment, as is the case in several European countries at the moment.
Paradoxically, in the case of either a breakdown of the ERM or a maintenance
of the status quo, investors and economists favour higher yielding European
bond markets.
'An ERM break-up would be dire for the Bund market,' according to Ms
Cottrell. Although the D-Mark would strengthen as a result, Ms Cottrell
believes a stronger currency 'would threaten the prospects of economic
recovery'.
German bonds have benefited from the perception of the D-Mark as a safe
haven, causing yield spreads of other European bonds to widen against
Germany. But this process could now be reversed.
Mr Philip Saunders, fixed-interest director of Guiness Flight, the
investment management firm, said he is 'not enamoured' of the German market,
even though he thinks that the Bundesbank will ultimately come down on the
side of the ERM. Instead, he has hedged the currency component of other
European bond holdings into sterling.
'If you remove the currency-flight part of the equation, then there don't
seem to be good reasons to buy Germany,' he said.
Mr Robert Gambi, manager of international bonds and currencies at AMP Asset
Management, holds a similar view. 'The current turmoil is providing us with
a great opportunity to become overweight in other (European bond) markets.'
For example, he recently established a new position in Danish bonds, hedging
the currency exposure back into D-Marks.
Both economists and investors are taking the view that the non-D-Mark bloc
could be poised to stage a strong rally. A number of analysts favour Italy,
untrammelled by the ERM, which has already staged a recovery in recent
weeks, and the French bond market remains a favourite, though investors may
not want to take on exposure to the French franc at the moment.

FT  26 JUL 93 / International Capital Markets: Kellogg to go ahead with
Dollars 200m debt issue

<TEXT>
KELLOGG, the US cereals group which posted a profits warning earlier this
year, has turned in second-quarter earnings in line with its predictions and
said it would go ahead with a debt issue of Dollars 200m.
The company also increased its stock dividend to 34 cents a share from 32
cents. Net income for the three months ended June fell 14 per cent to
Dollars 142.7m, on sales which slid nearly 3 per cent to Dollars 1.54bn.
Earnings per share were 9 per cent lower at 62 cents from 68 cents.
In May, Kellogg warned that its second-quarter earnings would be hit by
unfavourable exchange rates, trade inventory adjustments and unexpectedly
slow economic recoveries in its key markets, including Europe, Mexico and
Australia.
Mr Arnold Langbo, Kellogg's chief executive, said the company still expects
to post record results for the full year, 'and we remain committed to
delivering low double-digit growth in earnings per share over time'.
For the first six months, Kellogg had net income of Dollars 321.9m, or
Dollars 1.38, on sales of Dollars 3.06bn compared with profits of Dollars
103.6m, or 43 cents on sales of Dollars 3.1bn a year ago.

FT  26 JUL 93 / International Company News: Exxon and Mobil benefit from gas
price increase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EXXON and Mobil, two of the biggest US energy groups, exceeded market
expectations with second-quarter profits which were boosted by a rise in
natural gas prices in the US and the effects of substantial cost-cutting.
The news sent shares in the two groups higher in New York on Friday
afternoon and supported other oil and gas shares. Exxon ended the week at
Dollars 65 1/8 , up Dollars  7/8 on Friday, while Mobil rose Dollars 1 1/4
to Dollars 71.
Exxon reported net income for the quarter of Dollars 1.24bn, or 98 cents a
share, up from Dollars 930m, or 73 cents, in the same period in 1992.
Some Dollars 210m represented non-recurring credits, mainly related to tax,
compared with credits of Dollars 24m in the previous period, leaving a gain
in underlying net profits of 13 per cent.
First-half net income was up from Dollars 2.23bn to Dollars 2.42bn.
Mr Lee Raymond, chairman, said operating costs had been cut by Dollars 200m
during the quarter, compared with a year ago. Worldwide operating profits
from exploration and production rose from Dollars 693m to Dollars 761m,
after a net increase of Dollars 43m in non-recurring tax credits. The rise
reflected cost cutting, mainly in North America, offset by lower crude oil
prices and a build-up in inventories in the North Sea.
Operating earnings from refining and marketing rose from Dollars 185m to
Dollars 446m (Dollars 47m of the gain coming from non-recurring factors),
owing to lower costs and an increase in margins outside the US. Chemical
operations made Dollars 86m, against Dollars 119m a year ago, in the face of
weak demand and excess industry capacity.
Mobil's second-quarter net income jumped to Dollars 579m, or Dollars 1.41 a
share, from Dollars 255m, or 60 cents, as recent cost-cutting took effect.
Mr Allen Murray, chairman, added: 'Earnings improved on higher US natural
gas prices and on our strong presence in the growing Pacific Rim markets.'
Some Dollars 60m of the gains came from tax credits and other non-recurring
items.
Exploration and production earnings rose from Dollars 321m to Dollars 475m,
while marketing and refining income rose from Dollars 25m to Dollars 136m.
First-half net income of Dollars 1.07bn was up from Dollars 382m in the
first six months of 1992, excluding the effects of accounting changes.

FT  26 JUL 93 / International Company News: Sun rises on a new financial era
in Tokyo - Robert Thomson examines moves by three Japanese banks in the
securities business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN LTCB Securities opens the door on a new financial era in Japan today,
employees will be wearing uniforms distinctively different from that of
their parent institution, the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan.
'The uniforms have to be not only a different colour, but a different
style,' explained Mr Shigeaki Katagiri, president of LTCB Securities. 'This
is part of the firewall between the bank and the securities subsidiary. We
also cannot call on a client together with a bank official. It has to be
separate.'
Three Japanese banks open securities subsidiaries for business today. But,
as the finance ministry's strict dress code suggests, they will be limited
in their operations out of deference to a broking industry still badly
bruised by the collapse of the Tokyo stock market.
But Mr Katagiri is enthusiastic about the opportunities created by financial
deregulation, as are his counterparts at IBJ Securities, a subsidiary of the
Industrial Bank of Japan, and Norinchukin Securities, owned by the central
agriculture bank. All three operations have found new offices down the
street or across the road from their parent bank.
Before the stock market crash, these banks were to be allowed to house their
securities subsidiaries at head office, but by the time the Financial System
Reform Act became effective in April this year, the guidelines had been
changed, and tougher controls were imposed on dealings between broker and
bank.
In return for the banks' entry into broking, existing brokers are allowed to
establish trust bank subsidiaries, though they will not be allowed immediate
access to special large-lot securities trusts and special loan trusts in
which public funds are invested, protecting the territory of the trust
banks.
The guiding principle of financial reform in Japan is to maintain a balance
between new opportunities and the old players. As a result, only two
long-term credit institutions and the agricultural bank will open securities
subsidiaries today, while other commercial banks may have to wait another
year or two.
These new broking companies are not permitted to deal in stocks, but can
trade in straight bonds, and underwrite, though not trade in, convertible
bonds and warrant bonds. The finance ministry has promised a gradual easing
of restrictions, with timing determined by the general health of securities
markets.
Mr Astuyoshi Yatsunami, president of IBJ Securities, is 'not optimistic'
about profits for the next two to three years, but 'in due course' expects
earnings to improve. For IBJ, the opening of a securities subsidiary is
heavy with history, as it underwrote the first batch of Manchurian Railway
bonds in 1907 and has always seen itself as more than a bank.
IBJ's close links to leading Japanese companies had prompted concern among
brokers, who thought it had an unfair advantage and wanted the firewalls to
be as thick as possible.
One limitation is that IBJ Securities cannot lead manage a bond issue for
smaller companies for whom IBJ is also the lead commissioned bank.
'We hope that after two to three years, some of the conditions will be
eased,' Mr Yatsunami said. 'The global tendency is to have more deregulation
in financial markets. We hope this will be gradually realised in Japan.'
The emergence of the three institutions comes against the background of
banks having worked in the past to limit the growth of the domestic
corporate bond market, seen as a threat to their role as companies' main
source of funds. Restrictions were imposed on the type of instrument and
length of maturity to protect the traditional markets of the three differing
banks, the long-term credit, trust and commercial.
Financial reform has changed the terms of that relationship and reshuffled
banks' vested interests, as Mr Katagiri explained. He said Japanese
companies have more choice in fund raising, and banks are aware of the shift
towards tapping the capital markets.
He expects the new companies will profit from the expansion of the domestic
corporate bond market, particularly the secondary market, while LTCB
Securities will use expertise gained from the Euromarkets to introduce new
products in Japan.
However, the finance ministry has been slow to accept new products, and LTCB
may have to push hard for the approval of innovation.
US and European brokers complain that, in other markets, an action is
allowed unless specifically prohibited, but, in Japan, an action is
forbidden unless specifically permitted by the powerful ministry.
'Compared to the new issue market, the secondary bond market is almost
non-existent in Japan. Developing the secondary market is a priority for the
development of the new issue market. Compared to the size of the economy,
the new issue market is very small,' he said.
Employees at the new companies have been drawn from the international
securities operations of the banks, as well as from the medium-sized brokers
with which they have close ties. For example, IBJ has close ties to Wako
Securities, New Japan Securities, and Okasan Securities.
IBJ Securities has 140 employees, LTCB Securities 85, and Norinchukin
Securities 42. Norinchukin plans to take advantage of its rural roots to
offer underwriting services 'mainly with the agriculture and marine-related
industries', but intends to provide a similar range of services to the other
two houses.

FT  26 JUL 93 / International Company News: Nestle sales growth slows down
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER

   VIENNA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NESTLE, the world's largest food and mineral waters group, said consolidated
sales improved by 4.5 per cent to SFr27.5bn (Dollars 18.2bn) in the first
half-year.
In the first quarter, the group's sales rose 6 per cent and in the whole of
last year, they advanced by 8 per cent.
Nestle indicated that the slower sales growth was largely due to the impact
of the significant devaluations of the Italian, British and Spanish
currencies on its Swiss franc-denominated accounts.
The group said it expected that the sales growth for the full year would be
higher than that in the first half and that 'a satisfactory consolidated net
profit' would be achieved.
First-half sales volume grew only 1 per cent, and the group cited 'a
difficult economic environment, especially in most European countries'. It
claimed good progress in Asia and Latin America, and said the Brazilian
market improved. North American sales grew 'slightly'.
The acquisition of the Source Perrier mineral water group had a favourable
impact on sales as did price increases in some countries.
Nestle said it had detected 'the first signs of improvement' in European
markets, especially in the second quarter.

FT  26 JUL 93 / International Company News: Bavaria to sell 8% stake in
Deutsche Aerospace

<TEXT>
THE GERMAN state of Bavaria yesterday confirmed it will sell its 8.58 per
cent stake in Deutsche Aerospace by the end of the year. The sale is
expected to raise DM400m (Dollars 233m).
The stake, which will be sold to Daimler-Benz, the parent company of Dasa,
follows Bavaria's announcement on Friday of plans to sell its 58.3 per cent
stake in Bayerwerk, the country's third largest utility, to Viag, the large
energy-based conglomerate.
The announcement coincides with plans by Dasa to axe 8,000 workers by the
end of 1994 in response to recent budget cuts and the economic downturn in
Germany. Last year, Dasa recorded a loss of Dollars 217m on a turnover of
Dollars 11bn.
The speed in which Mr Edmund Stoiber, prime minister of Bavaria, has pressed
ahead with privatisation appears to point to a two-pronged strategy by the
Bavarian government. On the one hand, by reducing state interference in the
economy, it hopes to attract large conglomerates to Bavaria.
On the other, the Bavarian government intends to promote an indigenous
high-tech industry in the state.

FT  26 JUL 93 / International Company News: Shortfall at Quantum deepens in
quarter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
QUANTUM, the US chemicals group which has agreed a Dollars 3.2bn bid from
Hanson, the Anglo-American conglomerate, reported a second-quarter loss,
before income tax benefit, of Dollars 84.2m compared with a loss of Dollars
68.3m for the same quarter last year.
The results were worse than expected. Turnover fell from Dollars 542m to
Dollars 527m. Petrochemicals sales fell from Dollars 425m to Dollars 407m
and generated a trading loss of Dollars 5.5m compared with an operating
profit for the same quarter last year of Dollars 10.6m.
The group, the largest US manufacturer of polyethylene, said that sales of
the product were flat, and that average selling prices were lower than last
year, particularly for high density polyethylene.
The weak state of the European economies also affected volumes, selling
prices and profit margins for the group's other main products.
The company said margins were further weakened by the higher cost of
ethylene, the principle component for most plastics, and the temporary
closure of the group's ethylene facility in Morris, Illinois.
The propane operations, the second largest in the US, increased sales from
Dollars 117m to Dollars 120m. Operating profits were Dollars 2.2m compared
with a quarterly loss last year of Dollars 5.3m.

FT  26 JUL 93 / International Company News: Earnings at Posco surge ahead
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   SEOUL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
POHANG Iron &amp; Steel (Posco), the world's second largest steel company,
reported that net earnings rose by 40.7 per cent to Won133.9bn (Dollars
166m) during the first half of 1993. Sales rose by 14.4 per cent to
Won3,440bn.
The results, which were better than expected, reflected a recovery in
domestic demand and strong exports to China.
Demand from big steel-consuming industries, including the motor vehicle and
shipbuilding sectors, has risen recently as the depreciation of the Korean
won against the Japanese yen improves sales abroad.
Posco accounts for 75 per cent of steel production in Korea.
China has emerged as the leading overseas market for Korean steel products
with shipments tripling so far this year.
This has offset sluggish exports to industrialised countries caused by the
economic slowdown and anti-dumping duties imposed by the US.
Posco's tense relations with the government of President Kim Young-sam
appears to have had little affect on its earnings performance.
Posco fell into disfavour because its founder, Mr Park Tae-joon, opposed the
election of Mr Kim last year.

<TEXT>
TOMORROWS LEISURE, the Newcastle-based hotels and leisure group which is
quoted on the USM, said that Mr Stephen Lovely, who joined the company
barely three weeks ago as managing director, had resigned.
Mr Lovely's departure is the second quick exit recently from the senior
management ranks of the company, which this month gave a second loss warning
for the year to March 31.
Earlier this month it announced the resignation of Mr John Roberts, brought
in as chairman in February when the founder, Mr John Sanderson, stepped down
as chairman and managing director.
Mr Sanderson, who became executive chairman following Mr Roberts'
resignation, said it was Mr Lovely's decision to go.
He said the appointment of a successor was at an advanced stage; an
announcement of new board members would also be made soon.

FT  26 JUL 93 / UK Company News: S&amp;N in Pounds 80m expansion of French
holiday activities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SCOTTISH &amp; Newcastle, the brewing, leisure and retail group, has opened an
Pounds 80m Center Parcs holiday village at Chaumont in the Loire Valley,
south of Paris.
The development is the second in France - the other is in Normandy - but
despite the doubling of capacity, the company said the Chaumont village was
already achieving occupancy rates of more than 90 per cent.
'In spite of the recession in Europe, Center Parc's bookings are ahead of
last year in all the countries (the UK, Netherlands and Belgium) in which
they trade,' it added. Another Center Parcs is due to open at Longleat,
Wiltshire, next summer, bringing the total number of villages to 14.
Apart from the new developments, S&amp;N last year continued to invest in
expanding facilities at the villages - including adventure golf at six
centres in the Netherlands and Belgium, and a nine-hole golf course at
Elveden Forest in the UK.
S&amp;N's leisure division, which also includes Pontin's, now contributes about
a third of group operating profits. Center Parcs, according to industry
estimates, accounted for 80 per cent of the division's reported profits of
Pounds 78m on turnover of Pounds 335m in the year to May 2.

FT  26 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Failed targets bring about fresh problems -
The obstacles facing Brent Walker regarding the refinancing of the
ring-fenced loan to its William Hill betting shops chain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THINGS are hotting up again at Brent Walker. Since the property, pubs and
betting group completed its Pounds 1.65bn refinancing in March last year, it
has been keeping its head down - barring a management shake up in January
when Sir Keith Bright came in as the new chairman.
But now the group is having to write a new business plan - having so far
failed to meet the targets of the proposal originally agreed with its banks
 -and faces the problem of refinancing the Pounds 350m ring-fenced loan to
its William Hill betting shops chain by March 1 next year.
It has been reorganising the management structure of its Pubmaster, pub
estate management subsidiary, and pressing on with the development or sale
of its leisure activities such as the Brighton marina, the Cardiff World
Trade Centre, and the Puerto Sherry marina in Spain.
Meanwhile, Brent Walker is continuing to pursue Grand Metropolitan, the
retail and leisure group, from which it bought William Hill and Mecca
Bookmakers, for a reduction in the Pounds 685m purchase price. Brent Walker
is hoping to reclaim as much as Pounds 200m from GrandMet, and the two
parties are locked in arbitration. Even when that is concluded, the matter
may revert to the courts.
If all this was not enough to be getting on with, merchant bank SG Warburg
has thrown the group into the limelight again by slapping in a consortium
bid for William Hill, at a price which might be called astute, or more
bluntly, cheeky. The mooted offer is of Pounds 360m, just enough to pay off
the ring-fenced banks, but leaving virtually nothing over for Brent Walker.
Sir Keith's view is clear. Selling to the Warburg group would represent a
forced sale at a distress price. Brent Walker does not need to accept it and
has a duty not only to pay off William Hill's secured banks but also to take
account of its unsecured creditors and to use the asset to repay some of the
parent company's creditors too.
Since the equity portion for the Warburg bid, of about Pounds 180m, is to
come from venture capital funds which require a 30 per cent plus rate of
return, it is clear that investors willing to accept a lower return could
offer more. So the first conclusion is that another type of buyer would pay
more than the Warburg consortium even now. But more than that, there is the
hope that as the economy recovers, and betting deregulation gathers pace,
William Hill's profits will improve and the chain's value will rise.
Yet another factor should also improve William Hill's profits. Currently,
virtually all William Hill's cashflow is being used to pay interest charges
on its debt, although a sum equal to the depreciation charge, of about
Pounds 10m a year, is being reinvested in the business.
However, the interest charge is artificially onerous since an interest rate
swap, agreed when rates were high, has locked into an 18 per cent interest
rate. That swap unwinds next year and the interest charge will fall
substantially, boosting profits and producing more cash flow for investment.
The William Hill value could be released through a partial flotation, or the
introduction of an equity partner. One attraction of that for Brent Walker
is that while William Hill is ring-fenced the parent can take no money out
of it. But once it is paying dividends, Brent Walker will receive a cash
return from William Hill.
Brent Walker claims to have had a number of serious approaches for William
Hill, at higher prices, since the Warburg offer became known, which could
lead to an equity injection.
While in theory it is a William Hill board decision whether to accept the
Warburg offer, in practice it is up to the William Hill banks. Brent Walker
has an obligation to at least investigate that offer, and any others.
The William Hill banks, offered a full and early repayment of their loans,
something that seemed highly unlikely a couple of years ago, might be
tempted to accept. But it is not as simple as that.
If more than half vote to accept the offer it will go through. However, of
the Pounds 350m debt, 57 per cent is from banks which have also lent to
Brent Walker. Those banks want the Brent Walker debt to be repaid as well,
and if the best chance of getting that money back is by not selling William
Hill for Pounds 360m then they may be inclined to hang on.
On the other hand, the certainty of Pounds 360m in cash now compares with
the uncertainty of a stock market float later. While the new issue market is
strong at present, there is no denying that William Hill would not be the
easiest business to float.
Brent Walker believes it could even refinance William Hill's debt next year
 -possibly bringing in new banks or persuading the Brent Walker banks to
take on the William Hill debt - although privately some of its advisers
think this unlikely to be achievable.
If it follows one of the sale routes, though, it will have to take another
hit on its balance sheet. In the 1992 accounts William Hill was valued at
Pounds 701.1m, a figure which the directors admit is significantly too high.
They can get away with retaining the valuation while William Hill is 100 per
cent owned, claiming the fall in values is not 'a permanent diminution'.
But a partial sale of William Hill, or a successful resolution - from Brent
Walker's viewpoint - of the dispute with GrandMet, would set a new value
causing another substantial asset write down in the Brent Walker balance
sheet.
If Brent Walker thought its problems were over the day the refinancing was
signed it was wrong. They were only just beginning.

FT  26 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Shake-up at Medeva may be accelerated
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR BERNARD Taylor, chairman of Medeva, the UK drugs company, said yesterday
that the timing of some planned management changes could be accelerated by
last week's profits warning which almost halved its stock market value.
Mr Taylor said the changes included the 'inevitable' splitting of his own
role as chairman and chief executive. He said: 'The profits warning may
accelerate it. We really have not thought that through yet.'
However, he added that he would like 'several months to pass' before the
board considered any changes.
'One does not suddenly say 'lets review our strategy as a result of what's
happened yesterday'. One must take these things in a measured way and not
panic about them.'
Medeva's stock market value tumbled from Pounds 589m to Pounds 295m in heavy
trading early last week after the profits warning.
Mr Taylor said the management structure had been in development for the past
three years: 'Eventually it will be rather typical of drugs companies with
regional directors, specialist services in quality assurance, finance and
research and development and at the highest board level a reasonable number
of non-executive direc-tors.'
He said he did not believe Mr Ian Gowrie-Smith, managing director, would
leave the company in the wake of last week's announcement that pre-tax
profits for 1993 would be about Pounds 10m below market expectations of
between Pounds 53m and Pounds 57m.
Mr Taylor said he had no plans to retire before he reached 60, in three
years, and that he might well remain with the company after that time.
He added that he 'is not required to go as a result of this problem.'

FT  26 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Boots considers future of its drugs
division
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOOTS, the retailing and pharmaceuticals group, said yesterday it was
considering all options for the future of its drugs division, but had no
plans to sell it after withdrawal of Manoplax, its heart drug.
The company said: 'We would be expected to consider all the options
following the withdrawal of Manoplax, but we are not leaning towards one
option or another at this stage.' The drugs division has been widely seen as
too small to be viable.
Mr Gordon Solway, managing director of the drugs arm, will lead the
executive committee in a thorough review of the business plan it put
together before the withdrawal of Manoplax. Boots said: 'We are reviewing
the whole business plan for the pharmaceuticals business. It is not
something that can just be tweaked.'
Boots said the move would cost Pounds 35m in stock write-offs and
'provisions against manufacturing facilities'. It said there would be no
closures at the two sites making Manoplax - Nottingham and Cramlington,
Northumberland. Job losses, however, could not be ruled out. The company
said it would save on marketing expenses for the drug, which last year cost
Pounds 20m, and on research and development.
Boots also denied plans to sell its loss-making DIY chain, Do It All, a
joint venture with WH Smith. It argued that Boots was well-placed
financially to wait for the potential gains from a 'profits bounce back' as
the recession ended.

FT  26 JUL 93 / Economics Notebook: Union will require some social graces
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Last week's high drama over the Maastricht Treaty in the British House of
Commons was great theatre. So much so that it has been easy to lose sight of
the core of the enterprise which is the creation of economic and monetary
union in Europe.
However, with ratification completed in most member states, some economists
have begun to show new interest in the problems that could arise if Emu ever
gets off the ground. Their work highlights fears that it could put jobs and
businesses at risk in large parts of the European Community.
In the latest issue of the twice-yearly Economic Studies, published this
month by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, Mr
Steven Englander and Mr Thomas Egebo argue that Europe will have difficulty
dealing with regional economic disturbances once it is operating with a
single currency and monetary policy.
Their message is backed up by Mr Bernard Connolly and Mr Jurgen Kroger of
the European Commission. Writing in the Recherches Economiques de Louvain, a
quarterly published by the respected economics department of the Catholic
University of Louvain, they have suggested that the Maastricht convergence
criteria focusing on inflation and budget deficits will not be sufficient to
ensure the successful operation of Emu.
The authors of both papers on Emu were writing in a personal capacity. But
the OECD study, in particular, had formidable backing. A footnote makes
clear that the topic was suggested by some of the organisation's most senior
economists.
Even though existing plans for Emu do not envisage union before 1997 at the
earliest and provide a second deadline of 1999, the two studies indicate
that it will be a much more hazardous venture than it appeared when the EC
member states signed the Maastricht Treaty in February last year.
The potential weakness of Emu in the face of economic shocks is especially
worrying.
An underlying problem, highlighted in both papers, is that the EC has
neither the cross-border mobility of labour nor sufficient flexibility of
wages or prices to be a good candidate for monetary union.
Messrs Englander and Egebo of the OECD see no early change on the labour
front. With limited exceptions (the flow of labour between Ireland and the
UK is one), they say that labour mobility in EC countries is unlikely to
match the standard of an optimal single currency area 'in the medium term'.
Messrs Connolly and Kroger argue that the community will have to achieve
economic convergence on a scale far beyond the Maastricht Treaty's
requirements of low inflation, low long-term interest rates and low
government indebtedness for Emu to be successful.
'Convergence in supply conditions will crucially determine future employment
opportunities,' the two commission economists say. The EC countries will
have to bring their productivity performances more into line before Emu.
After Emu the expected real rate of return in one country relative to others
will be vital for determining regional employment opportunities.
But after weighing all the aspects, Mssrs Connolly and Kroger are doubtful
whether Emu will benefit the poorer areas of Europe. At one point they say
that exchange rate fixity is likely to 'slow down or even halt the process
of economic integration and catching up'.
Messrs Englander and Egebo focus on the difficulties posed by economic
shocks for Emu. With no scope for devaluation or revaluation of currencies,
'real exchange rate adjustments, when needed, must be achieved through
changes in relative costs and prices', they say. 'However, if wages and
prices are not flexible internally . . . such adjustment may require large
shifts in capacity utilisation and employment.'
The OECD economists argue that labour market flexibility or the mobility of
labour and production between regions will have to increase significantly to
prevent localised supply side disturbances having disruptive effects on
income and employment. The problems created by German unification among the
ERM countries give an idea of the difficulties that could arise after Emu.
They are particularly concerned that the EC economies will require a large
increase in unemployment to offset a sharp upwards lurch in inflation. Using
the OECD's 'Interlink' computer model to simulate Emu, they found that
changes in relative wages and prices work very slowly to restore
competitiveness and cost a great deal in terms of output. In one simulation,
they found that misaligned wages, prices and unemployment persisted five
years after an initial localised 'shock' jump in wages.
Such worries about Emu are not entirely new. There were plenty of warnings
about the project at the time of the Delors Report, which gave decisive
impetus to economic and monetary union when published in 1989.
In testimony to the Commons Treasury and Civil Service Committee earlier
this year, Mr Andrew Crockett, the head of the Bank of England's
international division, said the Emu convergence criteria should also take
account of how economies might respond to shocks such as German unification.
The stress placed in the two recent economic studies on improved labour
market flexibility gives some support to the UK government's opposition to
the EC's social chapter.
Britain, of course, has negotiated an opt-out from economic and monetary
union as well as from the social chapter. But it will be ironic if the UK,
with greater labour market flexibility already apparent in falling
unemployment over the past half year, eventually proves more suited to union
than other EC economies.

FT  26 JUL 93 / On the verge of a nervous breakdown: German banks are to
publish provisions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
German banks are about to lift the veil of secrecy which covers their true
financial performance - not fully, but enough to give new insight into their
underlying financial strength amid Germany's worst recession since the
second world war.
When the banks report their interim figures over the next few weeks -
beginning with Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank this week - they will publish
details of their provisions against bad and doubtful debts for the first
time.
Hitherto, German banks have had the appearance of being highly resilient to
the downturn. The larger banks reported record profits last year and the
figures released for the first three, four and in some cases five months of
the current year have shown that the profits increase is continuing - mainly
because of strong gains on the banks' own account trading activity.
This apparent immunity has been one factor behind sharp rises in the share
prices of German banks this year.
The highest gain came from Commerzbank, Germany's third largest bank, where
the share price has risen 32 per cent since the beginning of the year;
Dresdner Bank has risen 22 per cent; and Deutsche Bank by 13 per cent. This
compares with a rise of 18 per cent in the DAX index of 30 leading shares.
In the first five months of the year, Commerzbank's total operating profits
increased 15 per cent.
There was a similar percentage rise in the profits of Dresdner Bank in the
first four months. But these figures conceal the true picture.
The reason is that the total operating profits published by the German banks
do not take any account of mounting credit risks in the deteriorating German
economy.
They comprise net profits from lending business, lumped together with fee
income and profits from own-account trading in the securities and currency
markets.
Provisions against doubtful debts, together with actual write-offs against
bad debts, are not included.
Under the terms of the European Bank Accounts Directive - which must be
adopted for the 1993 full-year accounts - banks are obliged to be more
forthcoming. The German banking sector has decided to jump the gun and make
the most important change required by the directive at the half-year stage.
The banks have made no secret of the fact that the recession has hit credit
quality very hard - particularly among the medium-company sector, the
so-called Mittelstand.
This is hardly surprising, given the sharp rise in corporate insolvencies -
up more than 27 per cent in the manufacturing sector last year and a further
20 per cent in the early months of 1993 - and the troubles being experienced
by companies in such sectors as machine-tools and suppliers to the car
industry.
Up until now, banks have only provided a figure for gross provision charges.
Thus, Deutsche Bank let it be known that its total provision charge for 1992
was DM4bn (Pounds 1.6bn).
The figure for net provisions which subsequently appeared in the bank's
profit and loss account was DM1.85bn.
These figures are large and impressive but somewhat meaningless as the bank
 -in common with the rest of its peer-group - did not give a full breakdown
of the make-up of the fig-ures.
There was no clue as to the level of provisions against corporate debts
alone. The net figure is calculated after various undisclosed items have
been written back - for example releases from no-longer needed provisions on
country debt or on the value of security portfolios.
The changes will unscramble some of the ambiguity surrounding the figures
and will enable analysts to do more than just guess at banks' underlying
profitability.
Mr Ian McEwen, banking analyst at Merrill Lynch in London, predicts a degree
of 'public relations manoeuvring' in the interim reports as the banks take
advantage of remaining opportunities to fudge the true picture.
But, says Mr McEwen, 'it will become very clear that German banks are not
immune to the German recession'.

FT  26 JUL 93 / Gerstner expected to announce boardroom shake-up at IBM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INTERNATIONAL Business Machines' new chairman and chief executive, Mr Lou
Gerstner, is expected to announce a reshaping of the company's board of
directors tomorrow along with the struggling computer giant's second-quarter
results.
Although IBM declines to comment, two of the company's outside directors, Mr
Richard Munro, the retired co-chairman of Time Warner, and Mr Stephen
Bechtel Jr, chairman emeritus of the Bechtel Group, are believed to have
tendered their resignations. Mr Helmut Sihler, former chief executive of
Henkel, retired from IBM's board last month, while Mr Jack Kuehler, IBM's
vice-chairman, has previously announced plans to retire next month.
At IBM's annual meeting in April, shareholders criticised directors for
being out of touch with the computer industry, operating an 'old boy's
network' and having been management cheerleaders, rather than shareholders'
watchdogs.
Signalling change, Mr Gerstner, who joined IBM in April, responded by saying
that the 'composition of the board and the board's ability to contribute to
building this company 'would be considered'.
However, boardroom changes are unlikely to placate IBM shareholders fully.
Last week, IBM's shares touched an 18-year low of Dollars 41 5/8 , closing
on Friday at Dollars 42 1/4 .
Wall Street analysts are projecting operating losses of about 23 cents per
share, for the second quarter, compared with net income of Dollars 1.29 per
share in the same period last year.
Large write-offs, to cover the cost of thousands of job cuts, could
exacerbate IBM's losses. Already, IBM has said that it expects to reduce its
workforce by more than the 25,000 estimated at the beginning of the year.
Now analysts say the total could rise to 50,000 or even 75,000, with
additional charges against earnings of at least Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.3bn)
Talk of multi-billion charges has raised new fears of a further cut in the
dividend.

FT  26 JUL 93 / France to retain protective share of Elf-Aquitaine
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE French government yesterday confirmed that it will retain a 'golden
share' in Elf-Aquitaine, the state-controlled oil group, to protect the
company from the threat of a hostile takeover bid after its privatisation.
Mr Pascal Clement, minister in charge of the French parliament, said the
government would keep a golden share in Elf to prevent the risk of a foreign
investor 'taking control of the company' and to ensure that it did not 'pass
into foreign hands'.
The golden share is a common mechanism in privatisation programmes, in the
UK as well as France. It is a special class of share that enables the
government to override all other shareholders by blocking developments,
notably foreign takeovers, that it deems to be against the group's interest.
Elf was last week named as one of the four companies scheduled for sale in
the first phase of the new centre-right government's privatisation
programme.
The others are Rhone-Poulenc, the chemicals concern, the Banque Nationale de
Paris (BNP) and Banque Hervet, the banking groups.
Ministers have already made it clear that the sale of Elf was considered to
be the most complex of the early issues. Elf is not only the biggest of the
first four candidates - with an estimated market value of FFr100bn (Pounds
11.4bn) - but is also involved in the most sensitive sector.
Mr Edmond Alphandery who as economy minister is orchestrating the
privatisation drive, last week warned that the Elf sale may be divided into
different tranches.
Elf Aquitaine was earmarked for a golden share when originally targeted for
sale in 1986. But the 1986 golden shares expired after five years, whereas
the latest legislation allows them to last indefinitely.

FT  26 JUL 93 / Buy-back of Reuters shares expected
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CITY analysts expect Reuters Holdings, the international information and
news group, tomorrow to announce a share buy-back scheme while delivering
its interim results.
Following months of speculation about how Reuters will employ its cash
mountain of Pounds 710m, the company is likely to disclose details of a plan
to spend Pounds 400m buying back its shares. A source close to the company
said that 'the speculation is not far from the truth'.
Mr Mike Cooling, Reuters' head of corporate relations, said: 'We can give no
guidance on this matter.'
The company has previously signalled it was considering ways of disbursing
its cash pile, including a share buy-back plan. An increased dividend could
also be paid. Such moves would also not rule out the possibility of
acquisitions.
A senior media analyst said the economic conditions were conducive to buying
back shares. 'The dual rationale is that they have all this cash on their
hands and the earnings per share would be considerably enhanced.'
The analyst also attributed some of Reuters' recent share strength to the
growing anticipation of a dispersal of cash in favour of the shareholders.
Reuters's shares last week enjoyed steady progress, putting on 25p to close
on Friday at 1404p.
The share price has also been buoyed by expectations of interim pre-tax
profits which most analysts tip to be between Pounds 210m and Pounds 220m
against the previous Pounds 187m.

FT  26 JUL 93 / Barclays narrows top job list to UK candidates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BARCLAYS has narrowed its shortlist of potential new chief executives to
British candidates, although it is thought still to be considering senior
executives who are working overseas and outside commercial banking.
Barclays, which is seeking an outsider to split Mr Andrew Buxton's joint
role as chairman and chief executive, also fears that it will be unable to
announce the appointment by the time of its interim results next week.
Mr Buxton has discussed with candidates on the shortlist how
responsibilities would be divided.
The fact that US bankers or other foreign candidates have been excluded is
significant because Sir Denys Henderson, the non-executive director who led
the search, emphasised when it started that the bank would look around the
world. Mr Richard Braddock, former president of Citicorp, and Mr Tom
Johnson, former president of Manufacturers Hanover Corporation, were among
US bankers thought likely to be considered by Barclays.
The delay in the appointment has come in spite of Mr Buxton's hope when the
search started in March that it could be completed within three or four
months. If no announcement is possible at the interim results on August 5,
Mr Buxton is likely to try to quell anxieties among shareholders about lack
of progress by emphasising that the bank is close to appointing a chief
executive.
However, directors are concerned that disclosure of details of the search
would risk making it more difficult to sign a contract with the candidate
selected.
The shortlist is not thought to be confined to bankers. Directors believe
that an outsider, either at a senior level in a financial services company,
or with financial expertise in another industry, might be appropriate.
Mr John Tugwell, chairman of National Westminster Bank's US retail bank
NatWest Bancorp, was among those approached by Spencer Stuart, Barclays'
headhunting firm. But Barclays is thought to be considering other British
executives who are working abroad.
Barclays started its search after pressure from institutional shareholders
to split the roles of chief executive and chairman. The bank has also been
under scrutiny following its declaration of a Pounds 242m pre-tax loss for
last year.
Although Mr Buxton will retain a final say in strategic decisions subject to
approval by the board, he is thought to expect the new chief executive to
take an active part in discussions on the bank's strategy and structure.
Mr Buxton believes the role of chairman and chief executive is too large for
a single person. Barclays said yesterday that it could not comment on the
progress of the search.

worth buying' and suggested it would be better for the company to target
growth potential in an immature area of the industry.
Reuters would face some tax and regulatory obstacles to a share buy-back as
35 per cent of its shareholders are in the US.

FT  26 JUL 93 / Russian reformers fight to reverse decision on rouble
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SENIOR reformers in the Russian government yesterday struggled to reverse
the surprise decision by the central bank to invalidate all cash roubles
printed before 1993, a move which has shocked ordinary Russians as well as
officials in neighbouring rouble zone countries.
President Boris Yeltsin cut short a two-week break yesterday and returned to
Moscow. Government sources said Mr Sergei Filatov, chief of the presidential
staff, and Mr Andrei Vavilov, deputy finance minister, met Mr Yeltsin
several times to demand that he cancel the central bank's instructions.
According to one account, they had secured his agreement to issue such an
order, which would include sacking Mr Victor Gerashchenko, the central bank
chairman.
The bank's decision on Saturday, if effected, would call in all Soviet and
Russian roubles printed between 1961 and 1992. These would cease to be
recognised from today. Russian citizens would have until August 7 to change
the old notes, but only under certain conditions.
First, they would have to prove they had 'earned' the notes, an apparent
attempt by the bank to curb criminals dealing in large quantities of
roubles. And second they could only change Rbs35,000 (Pounds 23) for cash.
The rest would be placed on account with the state savings bank at interest
rates far below annual inflation and could not be withdrawn for at least six
months.
Long queues developed outside shops as people tried to change old notes for
goods before today's deadline. The rate offered by hard-currency traders for
pre-1993 roubles plunged to around 2,000-2,500 to the US dollar from its
level on Friday of 1,006.
A series of objections came from countries within the rouble zone, including
two autonomous republics within Russia. Officials claimed they had been
given no warning and in some cases could not or would not observe the bank's
regulations.
Bank officials and foreign financial observers say the main reasons for the
exercise are:
To flush out large holdings of cash which could not be explained by legal
dealings.
To reduce inflation.
To make counterfeiting more difficult.
To end the ambiguity between 'Soviet' and Russian money, and to make clear
that all republics which stay in the rouble zone would be subject to Bank of
Russia monetary discipline.

FT  26 JUL 93 / Finance minister sees no sign of Spanish recovery: Solbes
says sharp cut in labour costs is needed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE RECESSION in Spain shows no sign of ending and a sharp reduction of
labour costs is required to stimulate the troubled economy, the country's
new economy and finance minister has warned.
Mr Pedro Solbes also said the European Monetary System could not endure
continual crisis and he appealed to the Bundesbank to take the problems of
other EMS members into account.
Mr Solbes, the former agriculture minister promoted to the economy portfolio
earlier this month, indicated there was little chance over the next two
years of reducing Spain's budget deficit and said he would amend a package
of ambitious targets set by the government for economic and monetary union
convergence.
The minister gave one of the most sombre assessments to date by a senior
minister of the economic problems facing Spain. A technocrat and
non-socialist in a Socialist party-led government, Mr Solbes also gave a
frank outline of structural reforms and spending cuts that are needed to
reduce the budget deficit.
'With the data we have at present, I don't see short-term recovery,' Mr
Solbes said. 'It is by no means certain that recession has bottomed out and
we will have below-zero GDP growth this year, perhaps minus 0.5 per cent.'
The minister said he had to be 'very prudent' over forecasts for 1994
although the government was 'convinced' the domestic economy would improve.
'It is very difficult to suggest figures but we are working on a growth rate
of between 1 and 2 per cent,' he said.
Mr Solbes will be meeting employers and unions tomorrow for talks on what
the government has termed 'a social pact for employment' - a broad agreement
on wages and labour legislation that will address Spain's sharply
deteriorating job market. Quarterly employment figures due this week are
expected to show the loss of more than 100,000 jobs in the past three months
and an unemployment level of more than 23.5 per cent.
'My thesis is that wages have to be pegged below inflation levels,' Mr
Solbes said. He will also seek at the talks large-scale revision of laws on
hiring, job classifications and firing that have helped make Spain's labour
costs among the highest in the west.
Mr Solbes said he wanted negotiated agreements but stated clearly that if
these were not forthcoming, the government would act unilaterally and
radically to reform the labour market. 'There is not much time and new wage
guidelines must be in place by January 1,' he said.
The Spanish peseta has been devalued three times since September. Mr Solbes
believed the currency had weathered last week's attacks, falling to just
below its central parity rate in the exchange rate mechanism, but he warned
a speculative broadside 'could happen all over again'.
'The EMS cannot live in a situation of permanent crisis,' he said. The best
way to solve the problems was to move faster towards monetary union.
Mr Solbes said he was not confident that meaningful cost-cutting could be
introduced in next year's budget. The central government's deficit, he said,
stood at 5 per cent of GDP, nearly double the target for 1993, and at
between 6.2 and 6.5 per cent if local administration balance sheets were
included.
Mr Solbes said his main concern was to achieve a 3 per cent budget deficit.

FT  26 JUL 93 / Brussels to discuss Pounds 4bn waste over milk subsidies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Community has wasted an estimated Ecu5.38bn (Pounds 4.1bn) in
unnecessary subsidies because Italy, Greece and Spain have systematically
failed to enforce milk production quotas, according to internal estimates by
the European Commission.
The Commission is expected to discuss on Wednesday how much money to recover
from the three member states, all of which have pledged to respect new rules
to curb over-production.
Several Commissioners are said to be reluctant to provoke a fresh
confrontation with the Italian government. Relations are already strained
because Brussels is sticking to a hard line on state aid to Efim, the state
industrial holding company, and Ilva, the state steel producer.
The UK and Germany, however, are pressing the Commission to claw back a
substantial portion of the excess subsidies, partly to relieve pressure in
next year's budget and partly to deter future fraud.
The funds at issue cover 1989-93, but the problem goes back to 1984, when
the EC introduced a milk quota system. If production quotas were breached,
farmers were supposed to pay a heavy penalty known as the additional levy.
As late as 1991, neither Italy, Spain nor Greece had a system in place to
supervise milk production or to collect the levy, according to a report by
the EC's Court of Auditors. The Commission continued to pay full subsidies
even though failure to collect the additional levy should have disqualified
the three countries from obtaining matching levels of spending.
Internal estimates suggest that Italy owes Ecus 2.76bn for the period
between 1989-93, followed by Spain (Ecus 2bn) and Greece (Ecus 620,000).
The Commission meeting on Wednesday is scheduled to 'clear the accounts' for
1989 alone. That means only a proportion of the gross sum of Ecus 5.38bn is
under discussion, but the outcome will influence repayment for the next four
years.
In practice, the recovery of excess spending is likely to be reduced even
further because Italy has argued successfully that its original 1984
national quota was based on statistical errors.
Last spring, EC farm ministers accepted this point implicitly when they
agreed to a provisional, one-year increase in the Italian milk quota of
900,000 tonnes. Coincidentally, Spain won an increase of 500,000 tonnes, and
Greece secured an extra 100,000 tonnes.
EC officials said last week the milk revenue matter was proving so divisive
that Commissioners might not reach a decision on Wednesday, the last meeting
before the summer recess.

FT  26 JUL 93 / The Lex Column: UK housebuilders
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Investors who backed the recent spate of rights issues from housebuilders
must be irritated that no sooner have they parted with their cash than the
market softens. Housebuilders' sunny suggestions that reservations were
rising at an annual rate of up to 40-50 per cent may have been true for the
first quarter. Since then, however, the market has turned as flat as the
Headingley cricket pitch.
It is now clear that some specific factors were previously at work. Economic
scares last September deferred demand for new housing. The autumn statement
initiatives also tempted housing associations into the market. The current
worry is that with price rises in the secondary housing market stalling,
housebuilders will have to keep discounting to sell new houses, undermining
profitability. Moreover, anecdotal evidence suggests land prices are now
rising far faster than house prices. Housebuilders flush with rights issue
money are bidding up prices. Tighter planning restrictions have also
increased the scarcity value of land. This raises the spectre that margins
will be further squeezed unless price inflation returns to the system.
The pure housebuilders boasting long land banks may still be best placed to
exploit the housing upturn but their shares have surely run ahead of the
game. The market has already begun to take the gloss off the sector but
housebuilders' premium ratings remain suspiciously heavy.

FT  26 JUL 93 / The Lex Column: Philips
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
With investors scouting around for recovery stocks, even the seemingly lost
industrial cause that trades as Philips has won admirers. This year, the
Dutch giant's shares have risen 55 per cent. Its first quarter results were
better than expected, while the sale of its stake in a semiconductor joint
venture with Matsushita, realising Fl3bn in cash, has helped transform
sentiment. Combined with Philips' fierce cost-cutting campaign, the
company's balance sheet is finally returning to reasonable shape. Philips'
debt-to-equity ratio has fallen from about 140 per cent to 100 per cent.
Some are also becoming excited about the possible growth prospects for
Philips' flat-screen technology. The hope is that this may enable Philips to
make substantial inroads into the Japanese-dominated lap top computer
market. Philips must now be sorely tempted to have a rights issue to reduce
debt and fund expansion. Such a move might even be greeted as a sign of
positive intent.
The share price rise must still, however, owe more to speculative hope than
experience. Philips' record of past disappointment is a very long-playing
CD; its shares are still less than half the level they reached in 1986.
Recession in mainland Europe will continue to dog its progress. The history
of the consumer electronics industry also shows that even when sales pick up
prices continue to fall. Philips' forthcoming second-quarter figures will
have to provide further proof the company is recovering for the share price
momentum to be maintained.

FT  26 JUL 93 / The Lex Column: European insurance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Equity markets are always wary of the argument that the current business
cycle will be different from the last, especially when the proponent is an
insurer with shares to sell. UK insurance companies have already come cap in
hand to the market. Since continental European insurers started to raise
prices perhaps 18 months after the UK, European bourses might now look
forward to a clutch of equity issues. The recapitalisation of Norway's Uni
Storebrand and the attempted rights issue by La Fondiaria of Italy are
special cases of distress. Allianz's proposed rights issue announced over
the weekend suggests others are not far behind. But capital-raising has
barely started to repair the damage done by severe underwriting losses. The
likes of Sun Alliance and UAP of France have been bruised by falling
property prices. Since insurers such as Commercial Union are devoting
capital to the developing life and pensions markets of southern Europe,
there seems little danger of overcrowding in other areas. With their
government anxious to privatise, French state-owned insurers may be more
inclined to put profits before market share. On that basis European insurers
might look forward to several years of rising profits.
It still requires a leap of faith, though, to believe the companies will
maintain discipline on prices for long. The behaviour of UK insurers will be
the leading indicator in that regard. After three years of price increases
many are close to underwriting profit on some lines of business. How they
react to such an uncommon situation will be a crucial test of resolve.

FT  26 JUL 93 / The Lex Column: Polishing off gilts
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
For a while last week it seemed as though the rally in the gilts market
might have run its course. To the problem of over-supply was added a sense
that accelerating recovery might preclude further interest rate cuts. On top
of that was the political uncertainty - now resolved - over the Maastricht
treaty, while sterling was at a level which might deter foreign buyers of
gilts. The mood changed after the French franc came under pressure on
Thursday afternoon, creating extra demand for sterling. Now it looks as if
the downward blip was more a question of the market trying to position
itself for this week's Pounds 3.25bn auction. The fall in yields may thus
have some way to go.
The latest economic data showing growth sufficient to make inroads into the
PSBR without reviving inflation ought to be positive for gilts. If currency
turmoil in Europe prompts lower interest rates there, the short end of the
gilts market may be sustained by parallel cuts in UK base rates. Admittedly
the long end might begin to fret about the eventual revival of inflationary
pressures, but for the time being real yields still look attractive.
That is not to say the rally can continue indefinitely. The gilts market has
pencilled in tax increases worth perhaps 1 per cent of GDP into November's
Budget. It will be rudely disappointed if the measures are not forthcoming.
Since the yield spread over German government bonds is now a mere 110 basis
points there is not much room for further convergence. The need for a
premium sufficient to attract overseas funds means the gilts market depends
as much on developments abroad as at home.

Eyes blearied by peering for signs of recovery in standard macro-economic
data may sparkle anew at a micro-indicator of a spectacular up-turn soon to
come. The indicator is the micro-miniskirt displayed by Karl Lagerfeld, for
Chanel, at the Paris couture shows for autumn/winter 1993.
What's more Lagerfeld is by no means alone in discarding the recessionary
low hemline. Gianni Versace, for example, has gone for mid-thigh baby doll
nighties. Indeed, not since the optimistic 1960s have shorter skirts
appeared.

FT  26 JUL 93 / Observer: Sheehy's lore
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Hiring the boss of one of the world's biggest narcotic organisations to
report on the pay and conditions of Britain's police officers always sounded
a rather risky idea. But even a hardened industrialist like BAT Industries'
chairman Sir Patrick Sheehy seems to have been bruised by the ferocity of
the reaction to his committee's report on police reform.
Indeed, the hot response is a warning to elder business statesmen who fancy
rounding off their distinguished careers with a bit of public service. It is
one thing for private-sector types to be hired to knock a nationalised
industry into privatised shape. But heading a public inquiry can be harder,
and less satisfying, than a takeover triumph.
True, there have been success stories. Sir Roy Griffiths, a former deputy
chairman of J Sainsbury, did a good job following through his 1983 inquiry
into the management of the National Health Service. Lloyds Bank chairman Sir
Robin Ibbs and Marks and Spencer's ex-chairman Lord Rayner won honourable
mentions in dispatches for their work on improving government efficiency.
On the other hand, alas, Local Government Commission chief Sir John Banham
and Sir James Blyth, chairman of the prime minister's advisory panel on the
citizen's charter, may find it harder to win their public sector battle
honours.
As Sheehy has found, the job doesn't stop with producing recommendations
however cogent as well as radical. They also have to be sold to people not
on the inquiry chairman's payroll.

Stung by the official prisons inspector's remark that most inmates prefer

An example, handed to one who worked as a cleaner, testifies that besides
being a hard worker, he was 'an excellent timekeeper' - which, leaving aside
the question of how he could have been otherwise, is perhaps more than the
prison's management could claim.
The jail is run by Group 4, whose late deliveries of prisoners to courts has

Lions, not to mention unicorns, had better steer well clear of Britain if
the pom population follows the lead of the Australians. They have taken to
eating one of their national emblems, the kangaroo, with gusto since it went
on sale in one of the country's supermarket chains.
Previously sold for human consumption only in a few restaurants and
delicatessens, the animal that supports one side of Australia's coat of arms
has gone down far better than the chain expected. Indeed one of its stores,
Big Fresh Franklins in Sydney, sold more in one day than had been budgeted
for the whole week.
The huge sales prompted Sydney nutritionist Catherine Saxelby to forecast
that Australians would soon be getting their teeth into the creature on the
other side of the coat of arms - which, unlike the unicorn, has the
disadvantage of not being mythical. It's the emu.

Fresh evidence that the division between the Labour party and its formerly
loyal toastmaster, Mirror Group Newspapers, is more of a matrimonial tiff
than a full scale divorce. One of the better known figures attending last
week's party marking the first year of Democracy Now, the parliamentary
pressure group for extending Labour party membership to Northern Ireland,
was MGN chief executive David Montgomery.
Of course, he may just have turned up to chat to fellow Ulster folk. But it
suggests that Montgomery may be a little less apolitical than is sometimes
portrayed. Meanwhile, the presence of Lord Donoghue, senior policy adviser
to two Labour prime ministers, indicates that the party's own internal
divisions on Northern Ireland, could be harder to heal than the rift with
the Mirror. For a start, Labour cannot even make up its mind on whether or
not to allow the people of Northern Ireland to be party members.

Why are business schools as well as US corporations studying the food
emporium in Connecticut run by go-ahead grocer Stew Leonard? The answer is
his original marketing style which blends fun for children with a
pile-em-high and sell-em-cheap approach. Among the stacks of meat,
vegetables and so on are model cows that moo and egg-laying chickens, while
staff dressed as animals roam around.
Even so, it is to be hoped business schools don't start endorsing another of
62-year-old Leonard's original approaches, this time to tax accounting, just
revealed in a Connecticut court.
He pleaded guilty to conspiring to defraud the Federal Government of taxes
on more than Dollars 17m sales through a sophisticated scheme to conceal
part of the store's turnover. The scam involved a computer program, hidden
inside a hollowed out business directory, which altered records to hide
discrepancies from the auditors.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GROWTH in the volume of trade in derivative financial instruments such
as swaps, forwards, futures and options, has been an impressive but slightly
disconcerting feature of modern capital markets. There is good reason to
welcome the resulting opportunity for improved risk management at individual
banks, together with the wider economic benefits that arise from increased
financial efficiency. But innovation can pose threats for the system; and in
today's global market, such risks are infectious. In downplaying the
systemic challenge in a report published last week, members of the
Washington-based Group of Thirty (G30) think tank err on the side of
complacency.
The report is right in attributing to management the prime responsibility
for controlling risk. Its recommendations on how the job should be tackled
are, in the main, constructive. The controversy arises from a statement that
the amount of capital needed to support dealing in derivatives is 'a matter
of judgment for individual institutions, depending on their appetite for
risk and their ability to measure and manage it'. This is followed by an
assertion that there is no need for any change in the present regulatory
arrangements because the nature of the risk in derivatives is no different
in kind or scale from those already present in other markets.
Twitching eyebrows
That should make the eyebrows of any self-respecting central banker twitch
uncontrollably. Of course, it is true that the danger in new financial
instruments lies in such old-fashioned threats as credit risk and market
risk. But there is one basic practical, as opposed to theoretical,
difference in the present market place. Most of the people now in charge of
the institutions that deal in derivatives learned their trade before
computerisation introduced an unprecedented degree of complexity into
financial products. They were also brought up in a period when the culture
of banking smacked more of the co-operative ethos that prevails in utilities
than the current ethos of aggressive profit maximisation.
The implication is that operational risk, resulting from inadequate systems,
human error or management failure, is unusually acute in derivatives. So,
too, in view of the novelty and international nature of the business, is the
legal risk that contracts may prove unenforceable. And given that a majority
of the trade is through privately negotiated contracts in over-the-counter
markets, there is also less discipline from disclosure than in business
conducted on organised exchanges. After the Third World lending debacle and
the subsequent disaster in property lending, it would clearly be foolish to
take anything on trust from the banks.
Financial innovations
The authors of the G30 report would be entitled to respond that despite the
plethora of financial innovations over the past decade or so, no bank of
significance has foundered as a result of the mismanagement of these risks.
But that is hardly surprising: as the report itself points out, the size of
derivatives business is modest in relation to trading in bonds, equities or
foreign exchange. The headline figures may sound frightening - Dollars 3.9
trillion swaps outstanding at the end of 1991 - but the real measure of risk
is a much smaller and less readily available figure, namely the cost of
replacing the cash flows over the rest of the derivative instruments' lives
at prevailing interest and exchange rates.
Even so, there have been expensive, if underpublicised, cases of mis-pricing
of derivatives at large international banks. And the Bank of Credit and
Commerce International (BCCI) would have gone out of business in 1986, after
losing nearly Dollars 300m on options trading, had not the ruler of Abu
Dhabi come to the rescue. Much politically inspired criticism of
derivatives, notably after the Crash of 1987 and the later Tokyo market
crash at the start of this decade, has been ill-founded. But the
reservations expressed by successive heads of the New York Federal Reserve
and by officials at the Bank for International Settlements are plain common
sense. Ensuring a tough capital regime for derivatives should remain a high
priority of the central banking fraternity for the foreseeable future.

FT  26 JUL 93 / Leading Article: Growing pains at Microsoft
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NEWS that the US Justice Department is considering anti-trust action
against Microsoft raises intriguing issues of public policy. On the one
hand, Microsoft's dominance of the computer software industry is on a scale
calculated to arouse the old US trust-busting instinct. On the other, the
Clinton administration is pledged to create high-tech employment. Does it
really want to take a sledge-hammer to the national champion in a vital
technology of the future?
The latter point deserves careful consideration. If US manufacturers have
maintained their grip on the world market for personal computers, that is
partly because Microsoft created an industry standard for the software which
drives them. It may now seem easy to dismiss Japan's software industry as
handicapped by the Japanese language and written characters. But these have
formed no barrier in other fields of technology. It is thought-provoking to
consider how the world computer industry might have evolved over the past
decade if Microsoft had never existed.
The trust-busting argument is no less persuasive. There seems no question
that Microsoft is, to put it mildly, a highly aggressive company. The list
of its alleged abuses of power is a long one, from striking exclusive deals
with its customers to misleading the public about rival products. How far
all that is true - and if true, illegal - has yet to be established. But it
is worth remarking that complaints about the company's behaviour have been
raised in other jurisdictions, including the UK. And in principle, it
remains the case that suppression of competition harms the consumer and
risks stunting the development of the industry.
National interest
But the administration might perhaps consider the national interest on wider
grounds. Even supposing the US consumer and Microsoft's smaller US
competitors are being hurt, perhaps that might be a price worth paying if
the US computer industry as a whole is thereby strengthened against world
competition.
In this context, it is worth considering the recent history of IBM, itself
the subject of close anti-trust scrutiny in the late 1960s and early 1970s.
In the event, IBM was left intact; but given its own recent efforts to
loosen its monolithic structure, breaking it up earlier might have been no
bad thing. As it is, IBM's relative decline in recent years has not opened
the door to foreign competition. On the contrary, it has let in a younger
generation of US companies, from Compaq and Intel to Microsoft itself.
Dominant companies
Nor does history suggest that the breaking up of dominant companies has in
in fact harmed the economy in question. The break-up of Standard Oil
produced a formidable array of US oil companies, from Exxon and Texaco to
Mobil and Chevron. When the giant German chemical combine IG Farben was
dissolved by the allies at the end of the second world war, the effect was
to liberate the German industry under the separate banners of Hoechst, Bayer
and BASF. When the US anti-trust authorities broke up AT&amp;T, it went on to be
perhaps the most formidable telecommunications company in the world.
It has been suggested before now that Microsoft should be broken up into two
parts, one producing the basic operating software which represents the
industry standard, the other producing the next stage of applications
software in competition with the rest of the industry. At present, the
Federal Trade Commission seems to have backed away from anything so radical;
but if the case were to be taken up by the Justice Department, radical
solutions could be back on the agenda.
Failing that, it would help if Microsoft were to take a more mature view of
its responsibilities. IBM has come to accept its role in the worldwide
computer hardware industry, and is careful not to be seen stamping on
emerging competitors. In just the same way, the big Japanese electronic
companies have come to accept that the old killer approach to international
competition makes diminishing sense in a world dominated by political
sensitivities. As a young company with a phenomenal record, Microsoft might
perhaps dismiss all that as wimpish. If so, it is the job of the Clinton
administration to persuade it otherwise.

FT  26 JUL 93 / A degenerative research programme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
According to Professor Mark Blaug of the London School of Economics,
monetarism has become a 'degenerative research programme'. What exactly does
that mean? It all goes back to that great philosopher, Sir Karl Popper, who
has consistently maintained that the test of a genuinely scientific theory
is that it has withstood repeated attempts to falsify its implications. His
pupil, Imre Lakatos, was impressed by how difficult it was to falsify any
hypothesis convincingly. A defender could say that the initial conditions
were wrongly stated or that disturbing influences had been at work.
Lakatos, therefore, switched his emphasis to bodies of related theories
called 'research programmes'. These could not themselves be tested
empirically. But if a research programme was progressive, it provided lots
of subsidiary theories and hypotheses, which could both explain well-known
facts and yield interesting and unexpected implications. A degenerative
research programme, on the other hand, relied more and more on special
factors and ad hoc explanations, and failed to throw up interesting and
surprising predictions. A research programme could easily start out as a
progressive one, and degenerate over time, as with monetarism.
The core of monetarism in its heyday was that monetary forces determined the
rate of inflation in the long run. In the short run monetary forces could
affect real output as well as inflation, but it was difficult to generalise
about the mixture between the two effects.
Professor Milton Friedman originally put the typical lag before economic
activity was affected at nine months and the typical lag before inflation
changed at 18 months - although the final effects could be drawn out over
many years. Friedman also suggested that monetary policy was best assessed
by the growth of some measure of money and not by interest rates.
This, however, surely needed further investigation. Monetary policy has
operated via interest rates throughout nearly all its recorded history. The
high and variable inflation rate of the 1970s made nominal interest rates a
very bad guide to the real cost of borrowing money. But this is no longer so
obvious in the less inflationary 1990s.
At any rate, since the beginning of this decade the Fed has reduced
short-term interest rates from over 8 1/2 per cent to 3 per cent. European
monetarists were celebrating these reductions as an example of what could be
achieved in tackling recession by an independent central bank untainted by
an exchange rate regime or target. Unfortunately for them, some hardline US
monetarists have always maintained that the Fed, too, has got it wrong -
because the growth of broad measures of money in the US has slowed down to a
crawl.
A new paper* suggests that US monetary growth has been low as an indirect
effect of the bailout operation for the Savings &amp; Loan institutions. The
thesis that the Fed has followed a tight money policy in disguise is
difficult to sustain. The reluctance of bond rates to fall below 6 1/2 per
cent suggests that there are limits to how far the Fed can go without
stirring up inflationary fears. US headline inflation has been around 3 per
cent for more than a year and shows no sign of collapsing into deflation.
Above all, the monetary base - cash, plus deposits at the Fed - has been
accelerating to an 8 per cent per annum growth rate, compared with a
Friedman recommendation that it should be frozen altogether. Indeed, should
inflationary symptoms reappear monetarists will quickly flip over from broad
money to the monetary base. One can sympathise with Fed members who say
that, whatever they do, they will be accused by monetarists of not
practising the doctrine correctly.
The problem is that monetarists have succumbed to the market demand to
explain output, employment and every twist and turn of the cycle. They
should have stuck to the early statements which made it clear that theirs
was a long-run doctrine about inflation, which might have a bearing on
deflation and depression, but which did not explain the normal real forces
at work in an economy, forces which were, in any case, not easily
susceptible to influence by policy.
The monetarist research programme has cast its net too far and snapped as a
result - which is hard for those of us who believe that monetary policy can
have a moderating influence on boom and slump if its claims are not
overstretched.

FT  26 JUL 93 / Days of making hay are over: Unilever must cut costs or
increase prices if profit margins are to stay ahead of the pack
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If the stock market is a guide, Unilever is in trouble. Back at the start of
April, the US tobacco company Philip Morris slashed the price of Marlboro
cigarettes. Unilever's shares fell sharply. Two weeks ago they fell again,
when the detergent maker Procter &amp; Gamble said it was closing a fifth of its
factories. For the stock market, the two announcements meant one thing:
consumer brands are losing value in the penny-pinching 1990s. Unilever, a
giant in the world of food, detergents and toiletries, is the brand
manufacturer par excellence. Thus, since the Marlboro news broke, its own
value has fallen by a fifth.
Round at Unilever's monumentally imposing London headquarters, these
arguments are stoutly rejected. Take the two events in context, the company
says. The Marlboro affair is irrelevant: the price of the brand stood a
phenomenal 70 per cent above the own-label competition. None of Unilever's
brands carries remotely that kind of premium.
As for Procter &amp; Gamble, which is a direct competitor, Unilever admits a
touch of surprise at the scale of the closures. But the process itself,
Unilever insists, is not surprising in the least. The industry has been
restructuring since the late 1980s, and will do so for the foreseeable
future. Unilever itself has spent almost Pounds 600m on closing and
relocating production over the past five years. If anything, Procter &amp;
Gamble is catching up with the pack.
And, above all, says Unilever, look at the factors which underlie the two
events: recession, increasing competition, the concentration of the retail
trade and the rise of own-label goods. None of these is new. The basic value
of brands remains unchanged.
So far, Unilever is ahead on points. But the stock market could still be
right for the wrong reasons. The fundamental issue is one of profit margins;
and leaving aside brands versus own-label, margins could still be under
threat.
The crucial importance of margins to Unilever is illustrated by one simple
fact. Over the past decade, its sales measured in dollars have doubled. So
has the world's nominal GDP. In other words, as a supplier of basic goods
for eating and washing, Unilever grows in line with the world in which it
operates. If it wants to beat the average in profit terms, it must raise its
real prices or cut its costs.
In recent years, it has done the latter. Since the late 1980s, the company
says, it has been able to raise its prices by only between two thirds and
three quarters of the inflation rate across the countries in which it sells.
But thanks to that Pounds 600m spent on reorganisation - plus a steadily
rising bill for research and development, much of it directed at cheaper
manufacturing processes - costs have fallen faster than real prices. As a
result, though sales have only doubled, net profits have tripled; and as the
company proudly observes, its net margins now are the same as its operating
margins were a decade ago.
But this is to make it sound too easy. What Unilever has in fact managed to
do since the mid-1980s is hold on to most of the benefits of its improved
productivity, rather than passing them on to the consumer. In the same
period, Procter &amp; Gamble has done the same: its operating margins rose from
9.9 per cent in 1985 to a peak of 13.5 per cent in 1991.
Comparison with other industries suggests life is not always so simple. In
consumer electronics, the increases in productivity put Unilever and Procter
&amp; Gamble to shame. As the electronics manufacturers are fond of remarking,
if their achievements in the past 20 years were matched by the car industry,
a Rolls-Royce would now cost as much as a bicycle. But fast though costs
have fallen, prices have fallen faster. The world's makers of TV sets, for
instance, have collectively lost money for years.
If Unilever made hay in the late 1980s, it was not always so. As the chart
shows, until 1985 its margins moved closely in line with the world economic
cycle. Year by year, if world growth accelerated, Unilever's margins rose.
If growth slowed, margins fell. Intuitively, this is not hard to account
for. Unilever is continuously sparring with its rivals in hundreds of
product markets across the world. In a year when the consumer is feeling
affluent and volume is rising, a price rise is likely to be followed by the
competition. In a bad year it will be challenged and undermined.
In the latter half of the 1980s that relationship seemed to break down.
Whether the world economy slowed or accelerated, Unilever's margins - and
its share price - kept rising to new heights. The company today is in no
doubt about the reason. It is all down to the skill and persistence of
management.
The actions taken come under two headings. First, Unilever's tradition used
to be one of vertical integration: 'from the palm tree to the soap-kettle',
as the founder William Lever put it. The result was an immense sprawl of
businesses. 'It is easy to forget,' Unilever's chairman Michael Perry told
analysts last month, 'how diverse our activities were only 10 years ago. We
were in transport, distribution, market research, advertising, fishing,
printing, plastics and packaging  - you name it, Unilever had tried it.'
In the early 1980s, most of those businesses - accounting for nearly a
quarter of group sales - were sold off. This was not only an exercise in the
now fashionable doctrine of business focus. It also had the mechanical
effect of improving group margins, since most of the businesses sold were
low-margin by nature.
Beyond that, Unilever argues that it achieved a once-and-for-all margin
improvement in the businesses it retained. This came from the physical
relocation of production, the development of cheaper production methods and
the more efficient deployment of a massive advertising and marketing budget.
This process, the company insists, has further to run. In particular, the
huge rationalisation of production undertaken at the start of the 1990s in
preparation for the European single market has yet to work fully through to
profits.
Against all that, old hands in the stock market have a familiar and
maddening answer: once a cyclical, always a cyclical. It is in the nature of
business managers to be optimists, and to believe when times are good that
the cycle has been abolished. In the late 1980s the managers of Imperial
Chemical Industries - like Unilever, enjoying the fattest margins they had
ever seen - were honestly convinced that they had protected themselves
against the next economic downturn. Last year, they made a net loss of
almost Pounds 1bn.
Nothing so grievous will happen to Unilever. But as the company freely
concedes, the improvements in productivity and efficiency on which it prides
itself have been largely matched by its competitors. It is therefore hard to
escape the conclusion that its profitability remains in the hands of its
customers. The company appeals to history to demonstrate that the death of
brands has been exaggerated. History equally suggests that in the
cost-conscious 1990s, the margins of the free-wheeling 1980s cannot be
sustained.

FT  26 JUL 93 / Letters to the Editor: Ammunition against red tape
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr BRYAN CASSIDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, You expressed dissatisfaction at the limited results from the
Government's Review of the Implementation and Enforcement of EC Law in the
UK ('Red tape', July 21).
At first reading, the scrutiny report appears to be a bit of a whitewash.
But on closer reading the document is pretty damning of the way in which the
UK approaches both negotiation and implementation of EC law. In particular,
the report concludes that UK implementation of legislation does tend to go
beyond the requirements of EC directives; that this amounts to a more
burdensome regime for UK business which is potentially damaging to the UK's
competitive position.
Also identified is a weakness in the UK approach whereby negotiation and
implementation are seen as separate processes. In consequence,
implementation difficulties are not anticipated sufficiently to influence
the negotiating process.
Particularly damning is the report's case study into the Home Office's
proposals for new fire safety regulations. These were wrongly claimed to be
consequent upon a non-existent EC fire safety directive and would have
imposed major new burdens on British business. The report recommends that
'the Home Office Fire Department should reconsider its current plans to
bring forward revised regulations'.
There is plenty of ammunition in the report for those who wish to continue
the campaign against unnecessary regulation in the UK.

FT  26 JUL 93 / A different way to tame the tiger: Sluggish growth is
speeding the pace of change in South Korean labour relations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BURTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It was a scene reminiscent of the days of military dictatorship in the
1980s: riot police last week massed outside Hyundai Motor, ready to suppress
a strike declared illegal by the South Korean government. At another Hyundai
plant, 1,000 police dismantled barricades erected by workers staging a
sit-in in an unsuccessful attempt to arrest five trade union leaders.
This police action, however, was ordered not by the military but by a new
civilian government, which had promised labour reforms, including
improvements in workers' rights and non-interference by the state in wage
negotiations, when it took power five months ago.
Although the crackdown might suggest South Korea is entering another period
of acrimonious labour relations, the 52 days of strife at Hyundai, the
country's largest industrial conglomerate, stand out against a background of
generally improving labour relations.
The government's strong-arm tactics paid quick dividends. Hours after it
ordered the Hyundai Motor workers to suspend their action, labour and
management reached a compromise settlement that was narrowly approved by the
workforce of 29,500 on Friday. The eight other Hyundai companies on strike
are expected to resume work soon.
Even with the Hyundai dispute, South Korea's strike record has improved
sharply this year. Strikes have fallen by almost 50 per cent to about 100 so
far this year.
More than 60 per cent of wage negotiations among the country's 5,500 biggest
companies have already been concluded - faster than in 1992. And pay
increases among big companies are lower, with an average rise of 4.77 per
cent against 6.92 per cent in 1992. This is the result of an unprecedented
wage agreement reached in April between the Korean Employers' Federation and
the Federation of Korean Trade Unions, which established guidelines for pay
rises of between 4.7 per cent and 8.9 per cent. General wage levels,
reflecting sharper increases among small companies, are expected to grow 11
per cent this year against 15.2 per cent in 1992 and an average 16.4 per
cent a year since 1987.
The double-digit wage growth of recent years means South Korea now has the
highest wages on the Asian mainland, and is losing market share to low-cost
producers in China and south-east Asia. In addition, some Korean companies
are moving production facilities to other Asian countries to take advantage
of cheaper labour costs. While manufacturing wages have more than doubled
since 1987, productivity has lagged behind, rising 60 per cent.
The improvement in labour relations thus bodes well for a government
struggling to restore competitiveness and revive a sluggish economy. South
Korea recorded its slowest growth in 12 years in 1992 at 4.7 per cent.
Estimated growth of 5.7 per cent this year, although impressive by western
standards, is among the lowest in Asia.
Unemployment, although modest at 2.8 per cent, is creeping up, raising
concerns about job security.
'Korean workers realise they can no longer ask for the sky in terms of wages
because it undermines their job prospects,' explained Mr Stephen Marvin,
head of research at Jardine Fleming, the stockbrokers, in Seoul. 'A record
number of bankruptcies last year have added to their worries.'
A fall in the inflation rate to 5 per cent against the double-digit rates of
recent years is also persuading workers to accept lower pay increases.
The dispute at Hyundai, the nation's leading industrial exporter, had spoilt
this otherwise bright picture. But the strikes that affected almost a third
of Hyundai's 34 subsidiaries, including its main auto and shipbuilding
units, have taken a heavy toll. The Bank of Korea estimates that the dispute
has cut the GNP growth rate by 0.17 percentage points and export growth by
0.32 per cent. This, according to the central bank, is the main reason why
the GNP growth rate this year will fall short of the government's 6 per cent
target.
The dispute cost Dollars 283m in lost exports, exceeding the Dollars 260m in
total exports lost to stoppages in 1992, according to the government.
Hyundai has suffered sales losses of Won595.5bn, about 10 per cent of its
projected turnover for 1993. Lost production resulting from the strike
reached Won1,234bn, including Won475bn in lost business among its
subcontractors.
Yet some observers believe the government, in raising the prospect of labour
reforms, is itself partly to blame for the industrial action at Hyundai.
'The government raised workers' expections too high when it proposed several
labour reforms this spring. These reforms became part of the Hyundai
workers' demands to management,' explained Mr Lee Hahn-koo, president of the
Daewoo Research Institute.
Mr Rhee In-je, the new labour minister and a former dissident lawyer, had
suggested that workers receive partial pay during strikes, and be given a
greater say in management and hiring policy. The government backed away from
the labour reform proposals when it appeared they were becoming a
contentious issue at Hyundai and other companies.
The Hyundai workers, however, did not strike for these reforms alone. They
also sought average wage increases of 16 per cent, against the company offer
of 4.7 per cent, a shorter working week of 40 hours and benefits such as
housing subsidies. Under the final agreement, the workers accepted the
company's pay offer in exchange for increased fringe benefits, while
dropping demands for union involvement in decision-making.
Although the government's decision to rely on a show of force to curtail the
Hyundai strike was embarrassing for President Kim Young-sam, he accused the
Hyundai workers of making 'selfish' demands, which threatened to derail his
economic recovery programme.
'With its intervention at Hyundai, the government has shown that it places a
higher priority on economic recovery than labour reform,' said Mr Lee
Keunmo, head of research at Barings Securities in Seoul. 'But this does not
mean that labour reform is dead, although the pace of its implementation has
been slowed,' he added.
'The greater involvement of labour in management decisions, for example,
will come naturally, since the government wants to reduce family ownership
of the chaebol (Korean conglomerates) by promoting share ownership among the
workforce. This should reduce strikes in the future as workers identify
their interests with the company.'
And there are signs Mr Kim will try to make amends with the unions by making
Hyundai an early target for reform, reducing the management powers of
Hyundai's owners, the Chung family. Mr Kim has been engaged in a political
feud with Mr Chung Ju-yung, the Hyundai founder, since the two were rivals
in last year's presidential election.
'The biggest ramification of the strike may be on the future management of
Hyundai. The government is righteously angry at Hyundai for letting the
labour situation get out of control and it blames its owners for the labour
problems there,' says Mr Marvin. 'We could see the government compelling
Hyundai to allow a greater management role for labour.' What looked like a
defeat for labour last week at Hyundai may yet turn out to be a victory.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Yet again, you carry an article - by Vaclav Klaus - criticising the
effectiveness of western support for the development of central and eastern
Europe (Personal View, July 19).
As a manager working with projects for that part of the world, I am aware of
the conflicts with which any development agency has to struggle. It seems to
me the time-scale for conversion to market economies is too long for most
western financial institutions, including the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development. There is little possibility of establishing
'regional planning studies' Klaus refers to without some basic economic
stimulus upon which to base mid-term projections.
As I previously suggested (Letters, May 27), industry needs support for the
'exceptional' costs it has to incur as a price of entry to the area  - not
merely loan programmes, but full-blown subsidy. The UK's Know-How-Fund makes
a valiant effort with limited resources - the EC's PHARE assistance
programme has yet to break through into industrial development. Until
significant amounts of the 'political' aid programmes are diverted to these
requirements, our neighbours in the east will struggle to achieve adequate
levels of inward investment.
