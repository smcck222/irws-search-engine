FT  23 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: US alert boosts Tiphook
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMMENTS from the US that shares in container rental group Tiphook were
undervalued, making the company a possible bid target, inspired hectic
dealing in the stock on both sides of the Atlantic and sent the share price
sharply higher.
Takeover talk started after a US fund manager suggested on a television
programme that the recent slide in the comp-any's shares could lead to a bid
at a minimum of Dollars 20. This started strong trading in Tiphook's
American Depositary Receipts in New York.
In London the shares jumped 50 to 247p at one stage in active trading as
speculation of a bid mounted, forcing the company to issue a statement that
it was not in takeover talks, nor in financial difficulties. It said it
would pay its year-end dividend as announced earlier this month.
Shares in Tiphook had fallen sharply from around the 344p level just ahead
of its results on July 14, and weakened further following its report of a
loss after changes in accountancy practice. The company had aleady issued a
profits warning in April which prompted a heavy setback in the shares.
Analysts in London expressed doubt that a bid was in the offing but believe
the net asset value of the company to be around Pounds 4 a share. Mr Ian
Wilde at BZW said the current share price remains 'a poor reflection of the
long term value of the company'.
Profit-taking saw the shares come off the top yesterday to finish 47 up at
244p after strong trade of 2.5m.
However, doubts remain in some quarters about the long-term strength of the
share price, given recent worries about its trading performance.

FT  23 JUL 93 / World Stock Markets (America): US equities retreat from
record levels
</HEADLINE>

Wall Street
US STOCKS retreated from their record high yesterday after a drop in bond
prices sent equities reeling, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 30.18 down at 3,525.22. The Standard
&amp; Poor's 500 shed 2.67 to 444.51 and the Nasdaq composite receded 4.56 to
695.52. New York SE trading volume was 250m shares.
Although the Dow broke through into record territory on Wednesday, the rise
was neither broad nor particularly convincing. Secondary indices failed to
match the Dow's achievement, and the upward movement was primarily the
result of late program trades rather than sound buying by investors
impressed with the markets' fundamentals.
Consequently, yesterday's early declines were not unexpected. Bad news on
the employment front - jobless claims rose 24,000 in the week ended July 17
 -contributed to the gloomy opening.
Although bond prices rebounded in early trading, a warning from Mr Alan
Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, that because of inflation fears
an interest rate rise was 'somewhere out there' pushed Treasuries lower in
mid-afternoon, triggering a late sell-off in the equities markets.
Otherwise, much of the day's business was dominated by the latest earnings
reports, although investors appeared to take most of the results in their
stride.
AT&amp;T eased Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 63 7/8 in volume of around 1m shares
after the telecommunications group reported a modest increase in
second-quarter net income to 77 cents a share.
Compaq rose Dollars 1 7/8 initially after announcing a jump in
second-quarter earnings to Dollars 1.21 a share, but fell with the market
later to end a net Dollars  3/8 down at Dollars 48 5/8 .
Bankers Trust lost Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 76 in spite of a 35 per cent
rise in second-quarter profits. The stock had been close to its all-time
high prior to the results, and there was some concern over unusual currency
losses in the quarter.
Oil issues were flat, with Amoco up Dollars  1/8 at Dollars 52 3/4 but
Texaco off Dollars  1/8 at Dollars 62: both posted modest improvements in
earnings yesterday. Delta Air Lines firmed Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 51 on
news of an impressive earnings recovery. The carrier posted a second-quarter
profit of Dollars 7.1m, after heavy losses a year ago.
On the Nasdaq market, MCI Communications eased Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 28
3/4 in volume of 3.6m shares after reporting second-quarter earnings of 32
cents a share, up from 26 cents in the same quarter of 1992.
After an early rise on news that the Federal Trade Commission voted not to
issue a complaint against Microsoft on allegations that it violated
anti-trust laws, the stock fell to end Dollars 1 3/8 down at Dollars 77 5/8
on fears that the issue is far from over.
Canada
SUMMER malaise and weak North American bond markets hammered virtually every
sector on the Toronto Stock Exchange to a lower close. The TSE 300 index
lost 28.9 at 3,838.5 and falls led rises by 406 to 285 after volume of 50.9m
shares. Northern Telecom fell a further CDollars 1 1/2 to CDollars 27 5/8 on
its second-quarter loss.

FT  23 JUL 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Paris rises late on currency
speculation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SELECTIVE strength in late closing bourses, largely in response to currency
speculation, was the main feature of the day, writes Our Markets Staff.
PARIS built up strength late in the session as currency speculation
resurfaced; the rationale was that it might now be just a matter of time
before the franc was forced to devalue. Some observers commented that the
suspension of the 5-to-10 day lending window and its replacement by a 24
hour repurchase facility was 'the last straw' in the government's battle
with currency speculators.
This view was not followed by more phlegmatic investors, who felt that there
was far too much at risk for European monetary authorities to allow the
franc to leave the ERM. Those in this camp maintained that the Bundesbank
would make meaningful cuts in interest rates by September, at the latest.
The CAC-40 index, which had earlier seen a day's low of 1,937, ended 18.19
higher at 1,965.72. Turnover was some FFr2.6bn.
Among the stocks set for early privatisation, confirmed by the government in
an announcement after hours on Wednesday, Elf Aquitaine gained FFr4 to
FFr396, Rhone-Poulenc lost 10 centimes to FFr142.90 and BNP CI's shed FFr2
to FFr539. UAP, which has a 10 per cent stake in BNP, gained FFr3 to FFr596.
BSN rose FFr17 to FFr850 ahead of announcing after the close a fall in first
half turnover of some 3.8 per cent; while SocGen put on FFr7 to FFr605
following its forecast of good half year profits.
ZURICH continued the rally which began late on Wednesday after the market's
consolidation earlier in the week, and the SMI index rose 25.4 or 1.1 per
cent to 2,340.5.
Mr Mirko Sangiorgio at Bank Julius Baer in Zurich attributed yesterday's
strength to renewed program buying. He expects the market to move sideways
over the next few weeks, and does not rule out the possibility of some
further volatility. 'But over the longer term, I take a more positive view
on expectations of a continuing decline in Swiss interest rates,' he said.
UBS bearers were in demand rising SFr21 to SFr1,140 and Roche bearers
returned to favour, adding SFr180 to SFr8,180.
Renewed strong foreign demand helped SMH SFr17 or 7.4 per cent up to SFr245
and Alusuisse SFr24 or 4.6 per cent ahead to SFr540.
FRANKFURT closed mixed, the DAX index easing a mere 0.29 to 1,823.52 and
moving marginally higher in the post bourse. A little profit-taking was
reported in chemicals, balanced by buying in engineering, metals and
utilities.
One of the biggest blue chip gains of the day came in Lufthansa, which rose
DM4 to DM134.50, up 16 per cent since Mr Robert Willis and Mr Rod Hinkel at
SG Warburg Securities recommended the airline on July 6 on the basis of
improving immediate performance, accelerated job cuts, increasing cost
savings in 1993 and 1994 and an impending solution to the group's unfunded
pensions liability.
Turnover eased from DM8.2bn to DM7.9bn. Improved construction and
modernisation prospects for eastern German energy plants left Felten &amp;
Guilleaume, an energy technology company, up DM25.50, or 6.8 per cent at
DM400.50.
AMSTERDAM returned to positive territory, helped by the stronger dollar and
renewed buying of cyclicals. The CBS Tendency index ended 1.4 higher at
117.6.
KLM added Fl 1.50 to Fl 33.80 after announcing late on Wednesday that it had
reached an agreement with the pilots union on freezing pension
contributions, thereby cutting costs by some Fl 190m. The stock also
attracted a broker's upgrade.
The dollar's strength helped Royal Dutch, up Fl 2.30 to Fl 176.80 and
Unilever, Fl 1.00 higher at Fl 188.10.
MILAN became clouded once again by currency concerns, halting attempts at a
rally, and Comit index shed 5.80 to 552.57.
The weakness of the lira prompted foreign selling, particularly of
telecommunications issues amid impatience over delays to the privatisation
programme. Stet dipped L5 to L3,735 in heavy volume.
Montedison, L22 ahead at L702, and Ferruzzi, L20.5 higher at L430, found
heavy speculative retail demand.
Toro savings shares succumbed to profit-taking, giving up L386 or 2.8 per
cent to L13,212, after this month's strong rally which followed indications
from Fiat that it was considering disposals in the insurance sector.
MADRID, like other late closing markets, moved up from earlier lows to close
with the general index 0.78 higher at 258.99 on gains in some construction,
utility and industrial stocks. Turnover rose from Pta14.4bn to around
Pta18bn.
VIENNA hit a new 1993 high as the ATX index rose 10.68 to 923.25, up 5.2 per
cent on the week so far. At Kleinwort Benson, Mr Frank Jonuschat said that
fund managers, previously underweight, had been making slight increases in
their exposure to the market over the past six weeks.

FT  23 JUL 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei firms as Manila
sets all-time high
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FUTURES-related trading dominated activity as the trial began of a former
'godfather' of the Liberal Democratic party, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei average gained 34.90 at 20,115.81, after moving between 20,049.60
and 20,152.82. Arbitrage buying linked to the Nikkei 225 futures supported
the index, but the Topix index of all first section stocks shed 2.03 to
1,634.28, reflecting an overall easier tone. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50
index edged up 1.17 to 1,245.10.
Volume remained below 300m shares for the fourth straight session, being
estimated at 240m shares, against a previous 254m. Declines led rises by 535
to 418, with 203 issues unchanged.
Traders said that many investors are determined to wait out the current
political uncertainty. On the first day of his trial, Mr Shin Kanemaru, a
former leading LDP member, denied charges of tax evasion. Meanwhile, the LDP
was thrown into turmoil as younger members opposed the proposed selection
method for the next party president.
Mr Yasuo Ueki at Nikko Securities said investors will not participate until
the political situation was resolved. He added that the downside remained
firm as the current levels were unattractive for sellers.
The construction sector lost 0.74 per cent on fears that the Kanemaru trial
could implicate leading construction companies. Kajima dropped Y32 to Y760.
Hazama, which fell to a year's low on Wednesday because of its role in a
bribery scandal, firmed Y1 to Y445 on bargain hunting.
Overnight support of the high-technology sector on Wall Street encouraged
investors, and Sharp, the day's most active issue, moved up Y10 to Y1,380
and Matsushita Electric Industrial Y50 to Y1,320.
Communication issues were firm, the sector rising 1.33 per cent. Nippon
Telegraph and Telephone advanced Y12,000 to Y911,000 on reports that NTT
Data Communication, its subsidiary, will apply for listing.
Stocks with links to East Japan Railway were mixed. Tobu Railway climbed Y9
to Y866, but Nippon Express lost Y10 to Y1,040 on profit-taking.
Shiseido, the cosmetics maker, retreated Y30 to Y1,400 on reports that a
discount retailer will file an anti-monopoly complaint with the FTC against
the company's distribution units for cancellations of contracts.
In Osaka, the OSE average slipped 30.33 to 22,145.26 in volume of 23m
shares.
Roundup
PACIFIC Rim markets registered mixed performances, although some remained at
record high levels.
MANILA posted a second consecutive all-time peak in response to improved
market sentiment and the strong performance of Philippine Long Distance
Telephone both locally and on Wall Street. The composite index added 25.09,
or 1.5 per cent, at 1,706.95.
PLDT rose 40 pesos to 1,090 pesos after its Dollars 2 3/4 advance to Dollars
39 7/8 on Wall Street.
NEW ZEALAND saw a second consecutive three-year high, with the NZSE-40 index
3.44 ahead at 1,732.95, although forestry stocks eased back after their
recent strong run.
TAIPEI finished ahead, although off early highs, in response to small
deposit rate cuts by local banks. The weighted index ended 25.18 stronger at
3,932.15, after a day's high of 3,957.40.
HONG KONG was undermined by foreign selling by institutional investors
worried about the state of China's economy. The Hang Seng index receded
79.96, or 1.17 per cent, to 6,760.02.
AUSTRALIA traded lower as investors sold blue chips, and the All Ordinaries
index finished 15.9 down at 1,802.6. Futures-related trading, easing bullion
prices and a lack of overseas buying contributed to the softer market.
SEOUL was depressed by pessimism about the nation's economic prospects and a
liquidity shortage, which left the composite index 5.38 lower at 746.56.
BOMBAY was broadly higher on buying by financial institutions and
short-covering by speculators. The BSE index put on 38.05 at 2,161.37.

FT  23 JUL 93 / World Stock Markets: Devaluation move speeds Karachi bourse
recovery - An eventful week in Pakistan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FARHAN BOKHARI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Yesterday's rupee devaluation of just over 6 per cent by the caretaker
government of Pakistan brought fresh impetus to the recent recovery on the
Karachi stock exchange, after a bear market extending back to the first
quarter of 1992.
The KSE-100 index closed 34.46, or 2.6 per cent, higher yesterday at
1,354.95, up 6.8 per cent over the week so far. This week's surge also came
in response to Sunday's resignations by Mr Ghulam Ishaq Khan, Pakistan's
president, and Mr Nawaz Sharif, its prime minister. The KSE-100 index is now
24.9 per cent above its nadir of April 26.
Many brokers believe that the country's period of economic and political
turmoil may have come to a conclusion. Mr Wasim Sajjad has taken over as
acting president until the November presidential elections and Mr Moeen
Qureshi, a former vice-president of the World Bank and a respected
international economist, has been appointed interim prime minister.
'The market is rising because short term uncertainties are over,' says Mr
Nasir Ali Shah Bukhari, a leading broker and chief executive of Khadim Ali
Shah Bukhari &amp; Co. The new prime minister gave assurances last Monday that
the economic direction of the country will remain unchanged, laying to rest
fears that Mr Sharif's programme of reforms might be reversed. 'The thing
that kills investments is uncertainty; now that is over,' says another
leading broker, Mr Yasin Lakhani.
Many investors hope that Mr Qureshi's credentials will help Pakistan to seek
fresh assistance at the Aid to Pakistan donors' consortium, due to meet in
Paris this September. Islamabad is expected to request up to Dollars 2.5bn
in fresh assistance.
Pakistan is also currently negotiating a Dollars 1bn loan from the
International Monetary Fund under the extended structural adjustment
facility. 'People expect that the interim prime minister, having been part
of the IBRD (International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, a core
unit of the World Bank), will be more successful at the consortium,' adds Mr
Lakhani.
Although the political crisis may have ended for now, some brokers are still
concerned about the possibility of a heated election campaign, which could
raise fresh fears among investors. That could mean pressure on share prices
in the month leading up to the October 6 national elections, prior to the
prospect of recovery when a new government is sworn into office.
'The campaign would bring out charges and counter-charges, which might
create fears over the future,' says one broker. However, he adds, recent
assurances from powerful army generals that they will ensure free and fair
elections mean that the setback should only be temporary.
But yesterday's devaluation reflected continuing concerns over the economy.
Pakistan has just completed a budgetary year with a record deficit of Rp95bn
(Dollars 3.6bn), compared with a target of Rp65bn.
Last year's economic growth rate came out at 3 per cent, down from an
earlier target of more than 6 per cent.
The heavily weighted textile sector had gains in the market of between 7 and
13 per cent yesterday, Saif Textile advancing by Rp2.50 to Rp35.50 and
Gulshan Spinning by Rp3 to Rp26. The industry has been continuing to suffer
from large-scale losses, especially in the spinning sector; and almost
one-third of the 643 companies listed on the KSE are textile units.
The losses were a result of last year's floods, which left behind damage
estimated at Rp50bn to infrastructure and the cotton crop. This year's
cotton crop output fell from an expected 12m bales to just under 9m.
Recent monsoon rains have once again caused floods in the past two to three
weeks. The cotton crop has not been affected so far but, says a broker, 'the
monsoon season is still not over'.

FT  23 JUL 93 / Money Markets: French rates soar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHANIE FLANDERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FRENCH money market rates climbed sharply yesterday amid renewed currency
excitement, although the Bank of France stopped short of lifting official
rates to support the franc, writes Stephanie Flanders.
The French rates rose as speculative fears spread through foreign exchange
markets. One-month bid rates were pushed up to 9 per cent, compared to the
previous day's 7.8 per cent, while one-week money finished 2 percentage
points higher at 10.5 per cent.
Speculative selling of the franc had been on the wane on Monday and Tuesday,
with the currency recovering much of the previous week's losses. The franc's
recent resilience led many to think that the Bank of France could see off
the speculators, at least until a possible reduction in German interest
rates at the Bundesbank council meeting next Thursday.
But the chances of such a cut fell sharply with news that German monetary
growth had again outstripped its target range of 4.5 to 6.5 per cent,
growing by 7.1 per cent in June. As a result, the market's focus shifted
yesterday to how the Bank of France would react.
There was a spate of rumours towards the end of the day that the central
bank was going to announce a rise in overnight lending rates to defend the
French currency's position in the European exchange rate mechanism, but
these were strongly denied.
Earlier in the day, the French authorities had suspended their five to
10-day lending facility, the first official change in French lending
conditions since the current tensions began. But the overnight lending
window which the bank offered instead was no higher than before, at 7.75 per
cent.
The Bank of France last withdrew the 5 to 10-day window at the height of
January's speculation against the franc. But then the bank raised the
overnight lending rate at the same time, from 10 to 12 per cent. Many market
participants thought the French action not particularly dramatic, by the
standards of previous ERM battles.
'The Bank of France has taken one step in setting up more defences for the
franc,' said Mr Christian Dunis, international economist at Chemical Bank in
London. 'But leaving the rate unchanged limits its impact. The Bundesbank
might well think that the French could have done more to help its own
currency.'
Futures trading reacted to the tensions, with the September Pibor contract
losing 4 basis points to close at 92.65.

FT  23 JUL 93 / Foreign Exchanges: ERM battles once more

SPECULATIVE pressure left European currency markets reeling once again
yesterday as they digested the possibility that there would be no cut in
German interest rates next Thursday, writes Stephanie Flanders.
Although the Spanish peseta, the Danish krone and the Portuguese escudo all
sustained heavy losses against the D-Mark, attention focused on the French
franc. The Bundesbank intervened to buy francs several times during the day,
apparently trying to keep the French currency from weakening beyond
FFr3.4180 against the D-Mark.
On the French side, the Bank of France suspended a key lending facility to
make things more difficult for speculators, but did not raise interest rates
as some had expected. The French central bank would not confirm reports that
it was intervening to support the franc, but several traders were convinced
that French commercial banks were buying francs on behalf of the
authorities.
Pressure on the French currency re-emerged as a result of Wednesday's
disappointing German M3 figures. 'If the Bundesbank cannot reduce interest
rates next week,' said one London analyst, 'the attention goes back to
whether the French economy can get through the summer at today's high rates.
If the markets think the answer is no, then the Bank of France has to ask
itself whether it can credibly raise interest rates to defend the franc.'
Figures were released showing that last week's interventions had reduced the
Bank of France's net reserves by at least FFr17bn up to July 15. Observers
claimed that since then official losses due to further intervention will
have risen considerably.
Taking a large part of the speculative strain was the peseta, which fell
below its central rate in the ERM for the first time since its 8 per cent
devaluation on May 13.
Up to the early afternoon the Spanish currency had lost more than two
pesetas against the D-Mark, although it later recovered somewhat to finish
at Pta79.84, a little more than one peseta down from the previous close of
Pta78.74.
The Portuguese currency also fell dramatically, closing in Europe at
Esc100.25 against the D-Mark, still comfortably above its ERM floor of
Esc105.04, but considerably below its rate at the start of the week of
Esc97.10.
Early in the day, the Danish krone seemed to be in danger, as it lost ground
against the D-Mark. However, the markets were somewhat pacified by the
Danish central bank's decision to raise its official two-week repo rate from
9 per cent to 11 per cent. This helped the Danish unit to recover, closing
in London at around DKr3.8805 to the D-Mark, above its ERM floor of
DKr3.9016.
Sterling firmed  1/4 pfennig to end at DM2.5750. The dollar gained about a
pfennig to DM1.7080, and in New York it closed at DM1.7042.

FT  23 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Oil price slips as Opec meeting
is postponed

<TEXT>
NORTH SEA oil prices slipped by 15 cents in late trading as Mr Jean Ping,
Gabon's oil minister and current president of the Organisation of Petroleum
Exporting Countries postponed its emergency meeting, planned for July 28.
Mr Ping who had been holding talks in Jeddah with Saudi Arabia's oil
minister Mr Hisham Nazer, said that the organisation had not had enough time
for consultations before its meeting next Wednesday and so it would now be
put off at least until the second week of August.
Opec called an emergency meeting on Monday after a sharp fall in prices on
fears that Iraq was close to an accord with the United Nations that would
allow it to supply Dollars 1.6bn-worth of oil or 500,000 to 600,000 barrels
a day over six months. The market is already well supplied as most of Opec's
members are producing more than their share of the overall ceiling.
However, Opec members have their hands tied in deciding a plan of action
until they know the details of any Iraqi accord with the UN. Since Iraq's
negotiators have not yet returned from Baghdad to New York, talks are
unlikely to resume until next week.
The oil prices have risen on the back of the lull in the Iraqi talks and the
scheduled Opec meeting, taking some of the pressure off ministers who feel
that to meet before they know the full terms of an Iraqi deal would be
worthless.

FT  23 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Russia lifts farmers' grain
prices
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE RUSSIAN government yesterday agreed to pay their farmers Rbs60,000
(Dollars 60) a tonne for state grain purchases this year - a rise of
one-third over its previous offer of Rbs45,000 a tonne but well short of the
farmers' demand of Rbs110,000 a tonne. However, Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, the
prime minister, said the price should be indexed to inflation, according to
the official news service Itar Tass.
Tass quoted Ms Lira Rozenova, head of the state pricing committee, as saying
that food prices would go up 1.7 times if grain were bought at Rbs50,000 a
tonne and 2.5 to 3 times at Rbs100,000 a tonne.
The government is relatively optimistic on this year's harvest, forecasting
a substantial rise on last year's 106m tonnes. Mr Victor Khlystun, the
agriculture minister, said in Moscow earlier this week that the yield was
higher this year and the harvest might be as high as 110m tonnes.
On government figures, some 2m hectares have been harvested so far, 1m ha
down on the same time last year. So far 7.1m tonnes have been threshed, down
1.7m.
Russia bought some 25m tonnes of grain from abroad last year, and ministers
are hoping that it will be less this year. Mr Khlystun told the cabinet
yesterday that, 'given favourable conditions', purchases should be limited
to soyabeans and maize.

FT  23 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: 'Abyss looms' as tin hits fresh
20-year low
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NIGHTMARE for tin producers worsened yesterday as prices on the London
Metal Exchange fell to fresh 20-year lows. The move followed a decisive
break through Dollars 5,000 a tonne - below most mines' production costs -
for three-month metal on Wednesday. Overnight the price fell to a low of
MDollars 12.50 a kilogram in Kuala Lumpur, where traders blamed selling from
China and Brazil, high stock levels and no consumer interest.
Three-month tin closed last night at Dollars 4,955 a tonne, down Dollars 20
on the day and Dollars 92.50 on the week. At the beginning of the year the
price was above Dollars 6,000 a tonne.
Analysts painted a bleak picture for tin yesterday. 'The abyss looms,' said
one, while another described the market as 'on its knees'.
Stocks in LME warehouses stand at 20,415 tonnes, about 100 tonnes below
recent highs. But worldwide stocks are estimated at a total of 40,000
tonnes, the highest level since 1986, not long after the International Tin
Council's collapse left 100,000 tonnes of stock overhanging the market.
Mr Fidelis Madavo, analyst with Commodities Research Unit, estimates
consumption this year at about 180,000 tonnes, which puts the stocks at
around 12 weeks of supply. 'Demand is very weak and supplies are strong,' he
said yesterday. In addition to Brazil and China, Vietnam has emerged as a
seller, while scrap is coming out of Russia.
At these levels some weak producers could be forced to call it a day, he
suggested, then the market might be able to form a base.
London Metal Exchange turnover rose by 46 per cent last year following a 27
per cent rise in 1991. Mr Raj Bagri, chairman, in the LME financial
statement for 1992, described the rise - for the sixth successive year - as
'heartening' since the base metals industry had suffered more than most in
what had proved to be a difficult trading year. However, exchange income
fell back to Pounds 4.36m from Pounds 4.54m in 1991, while pre-tax profits
retreated to Pounds 1.05m from Pounds 1.41m.

<TEXT>
GOLD was fixed in the afternoon only 15 cents a troy ounce higher than its
morning setting on the London bullion market, reflecting a minor rally after
speculative selling on the Comex opening. It was fixed at Dollars 389.15 a
troy ounce after the market had tested the key Dollars 388 support level,
before buying on the dips lifted prices back above Dollars 390. After its
sell-off the previous night, New York opened with speculator selling and
prices quickly fell, putting the second key support at Dollars 385
apparently under threat. Dealers cited higher than expected US jobless
claims adding to the speculators' already nervous disposition. New York
COFFEE prices were higher at midsession. Analysts said that a lack of follow
through to an early breach of 71 cents was seen as positive and sparked
mixed covering of short positions assumed on the recent slip from
eight-month highs. ALUMINIUM prices showed some downside resilience on the
LME, against a growing perception that the long down-trend is over. Dealers
said the imminent expiry of the labour contract at Alcan's Kitimat smelter
might not lead to an immediate strike.

FT  23 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Norway takes first, wary steps
towards EC - Sentiment is still tilted in favour of the anti-accession
faction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN FOSSLI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EARLIER THIS month Norway submitted two of its three most crucial position
papers - fisheries and agriculture - to Brussels, kicking off an arduous
process of negotiations to accede to membership in the European Community.
Norway's economy is healthy and it possesses a base of natural resources -
fish, oil and natural gas - which would allow the community to become more
self-sufficient and diversified in these areas.
So-called exploratory talks on fisheries have been held between Oslo and
Brussels but negotiations on that sensitive issue and another, agriculture,
will not begin in earnest until after Norway's general elections on
September 13 are out of the way.
'The outcome of negotiations in this area (fisheries) will play a decisive
role in determining public attitude on Norwegian accession to the
community,' says Mr Jan Henry T. Olsen, the fisheries minister.
Mrs Gro Harlem Brundtland, the prime minister, has given a virtual veto on
the EC issue to Mr Olsen, who has a strong anti-EC record. The minister says
he can only recommend membership to the electorate if Norway's demands on
fish are met.
The third most important issue in the negotiations is energy. Norway,
western Europe's biggest oil producer and the third biggest supplier of
natural gas to the community, has not yet spelled out energy demands in a
position paper. It has expressed strong disapproval of the community's plans
to introduce an oil and gas licensing directive when Norway is struggling to
convince a resistant electorate of the benefits of EC membership.
Mrs Brundtland said recently that the Oslo government did not view the
proposal as a very positive move. 'The situation reminds us of 1972 when the
EC adopted a fisheries policy shortly before Norway was going to make the
decision on whether or not to become a member of the community. That move in
itself had a considerable impact on the Norwegian referendum.'
More than 80 per cent of Norway's petroleum exports and all of its natural
gas make their way to the community, accounting for 15 per cent of the EC's
total supply of oil and gas.
After twice having membership applications rebuffed in 1961 and 1967,
Norwegian voters rejected entry in 1972. Sentiment on accession is still
tilted in favour of a robust anti-EC faction.
In Norway's two position papers, it has demanded special arrangements for
fisheries and agriculture to help ensure its policy of strategic
distribution of population is maintained. Any changes in community policy on
issues that would affect Norway should be postponed until the country makes
up its mind on membership, Norway says.
On fisheries, Norway believes it is important that it be allowed to continue
its management regime, which ensures adequate control and sustainable
management of all marine resources and aquaculture activities, minke whales
notwithstanding.
Repeatedly Mr Olsen has warned Brussels that Norway has no fish to give
away. But under the European Economic Area trade pact between the EC and the
European Free Trade Association, of which Norway is a member, Norway has
agreed to a gradual escalation of fishing quotas to the community for cod,
which will reach 11,000 tonnes by 1997, under the regime.
Brussels officials say there were no surprises in Norway's position paper on
fisheries, but there is a view that it may be 'preachifying' on the issue.
The present annual volume of exchanges of fish quotas between Norway and the
EC are up to 300,000 tonnes each way. In Norway's view, the principle of
relative stability constitutes an essential means of ensuring a satisfactory
quota system. It also wants the 12-mile coastal zone to be maintained at
least until 2002.
Norway wants arrangements to ensure that fishing entitlements remain at the
disposal of the member states to which they have been allocated. It is also
demanding free access to EC markets for all its fish and fish products from
the date of membership, planned from January 1, 1995.
The country has some 27,000 fishermen and exports about NKr16bn (Pounds
1.45bn) worth of fish a year. Officials estimate that free access to the EC
market could save Norway's fishing industry about NKr300m a year. Mr Olsen
has expressed concern over EC fishermen seeking to gain access to Norway's
fish by buying up the country's fishing fleets. He points out deficiencies
in the the EC's resource management regime and urges Brussels to improve
measures on monitoring and control.
'Given the extent and importance of her fishing industry, Norway will have
to play a major role in the development of the (community's) common
fisheries policy,' he says.
On agriculture, Mrs Gunhild Oeyangen, Norway's agriculture minister, says
that Norway is not seeking derogations from the community's rules, but
special arrangements will be required to ensure that the EC's common
agricultural policy is adopted effectively by Norway. Last February Norway's
parliament approved new guidelines for agricultural policy to promote a more
market-orientated sector through cost-efficient use of capital and resources
while pursuing a balance between supply and demand.
Norway's main problem in this area is that its producer prices are twice as
high as those in the community, partly because it insists on maintaining an
agricultural structure capable of ensuring the viability of rural
communities in all parts of the country.
Mrs Oeyangen says that adjustment to the present EC price and acreage
support level would involve a considerable drop in income by grain
producers. 'If farmers in these areas turn to livestock production, this
would have serious negative consequences for farmers already engaged in
livestock production in other areas,' she warns.
Because of this Norway is demanding 'special solutions' to keep areas from
lying fallow. 'An adjustment to the EC price level will require transitional
arrangements,' Mrs Oeyangen says. Community officials view Norway's position
on agriculture as not comprising an insurmountable obstacle and have
suggested that the common agricultural policy will have to be examined
thoroughly to see how it could benefit Norway.
'We need to identify what gap would be left in funds to Norway when it
complies to the CAP.' they say. 'Will new measures be required; will the use
of other EC funds be possible; will aspects of the competition policy be
able to benefit Norway?'
However, on energy Norway is stalling on signing the European Energy Charter
for co-operation with central and eastern European countries until it is
given assurances by the community that it can retain its sovereign right to
ownership its oil resources.
'There should be room for such a policy in an all-European, broad-based
multilateral arrangement. If so, Norway for its part would be able to
conclude the European Energy Treaty negotiations,' Mrs Brundtland said
recently.

FT  23 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Anglo reduces gold hedging
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ANGLO AMERICAN Corporation, the world's largest gold producer, yesterday
disclosed for the first time detailed information about the extent of its
hedging operations.
Mr Clem Sunter, chairman of Anglo's gold and uranium division said there
were two reasons for this change of stance: the group had achieved its
hedging targets, and it was no longer heavily involved in the market, and
had not been since April. As a result, he said, shareholders' interests
would no longer be prejudiced by the release of such information.
Mr Sunter's announcement follows a similar declaration earlier this week by
JCI, which has not previously disclosed details of their hedging operations,
and greater disclosure from Gengold. Both Gengold and JCI said they were
responding to heightened shareholder interest in the extent of a mine's
forwards sales following the recent surge in the gold price.
Figures released by Anglo - which produces about 270 tonnes of gold a year -
show that its producers have, in the year to June 1994, sold forward 24-39
per cent of their production, at average prices ranging from R37,800 to
R40,800 a kilogram. The gold price is now just under R42,000 a kilogram.
Slightly lower portions of production have been sold forward in the year to
June 1995, generally in the R40,000-45,000 a kilogram bracket. Smaller
portions again have been sold in the year to June 1996.
Mr Sunter highlighted two main achievements of the hedging programme to
date. First, it had kept marginal areas going at full production. He said
this accounted for about 50 tonnes of gold annually. Second, it had helped
keep all the group's major capital expenditure projects on track by ensuring
that they had suitable tax shields. This accounted for about 60 tonnes of
annual production. Hedging had thus served as an insurance policy to keep
110 tonnes a year of production in place, protecting 70,000 jobs in the
process. Mr Sunter said that even if the gold price rose, he felt very happy
to have secured 110 tonnes of production, worth about R4.4bn at current
prices.
Looking ahead, he said that now that the group had moved from the 'low to
the middle playing field', it would be securing forward positions on a lower
percentage of its production. Previously Anglo has said that it would never
have more than 50 per cent of production hedged at any one time. Mr Sunter
added, however, that the group had no intention of buying back its
outstanding positions.

FT  23 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: EC unveils plans to curb wine
surplus
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE EUROPEAN Commission yesterday unveiled plans for curbing the European
Community's growing wine lake, starting with a U-turn on its policy of using
generous subsidies to encourage the distillation of surplus wine.
Mr Rene Steichen, EC farm commissioner, said the commission favoured
measures to prevent surpluses, such as higher premiums to dig up vineyards
and the reduction of sugaring, which farmers use to produce higher yields.
Mr Steichen's new policy comes in response to falling wine consumption and
higher yields in Europe and tougher competition from cheap imports from
Latin America and eastern Europe.
The EC's current wine surplus is about 22m hectolitres. The commission
initiative is intended to complement the common agricultural policy reform
of 1992, which aims to reduce excess cereal production and to curb export
subsidies.
Mr Steichen forecast that, on present trends, without reforms, the EC wine
surplus would expand 40m hectolitres by the year 2000. Only 15m hectolitres
could be disposed of by distillation, he said.
'There is too much wine,' he told a news conference, 'the reduction of the
area of cultivation is more than offset by the increase in yield and the
decrease in consumption.
Mr Steichen expressed dissatisfaction with the earlier EC policy of
encouraging distillation of excess wine. This encouraged fraud and increased
the incentive for farmers to over-produce because EC subsidies made this
profitable.
As a result, the commission intended to reverse the thrust of its present
aid programme, the commissioner said.
In 1993, the EC is expected to spend Ecu1.6bn (Pounds 1.2bn) supporting the
wine market, some Ecu900m of which will be used to drain off the so-called
wine lake.
Under the new regime, the Commission intends to use the bulk of its budget
to prevent surpluses rather than to dispose of them. Dissuasive measures
such as compulsory distillation will be reinforced with national quotas and
lower prices.
The commission adopted Mr Steichen's proposals at a meeting in Brussels
yesterday. The next step is to seek approval from the Council of Ministers
from the 12 member states.
The EC's wine surplus was estimated at 37m hectolitres in 1992-93 on a
harvest estimated at 192.7m hectolitres. Mr Steichen declined to forecast
the 1993-94 wine harvest.
Although some 50,000 hectares of vineyards a year are being dug up under
EC-funded schemes, mostly in Italy, France and Spain, the vines are often
the oldest and least productive.

FT  23 JUL 93 / Government Bonds: Fresh rate cut hopes drive up most
European prices
</HEADLINE>

PRESSURE on the European exchange rate mechanism intensified yesterday,
sending many government bond markets higher as hopes for rate cuts soared.
France took centre stage as the French central bank suspended its 5- to
10-day lending facility. Dealers said it also intervened in the money
markets to support the currency.
On the Matif, the Notionnel fell sharply during morning trading on growing
economic uncertainty and the prospect of tighter monetary policy. The
September contract was down 0.34 at its lowest, marking a fall of nearly one
percentage point in the past two days.
Then, the Banque de France suspended its 7.75 per cent repo and replaced it
with 24-hour funding at the same rate. There was some surprise that it did
not raise rates as it did in January during the last bout of currency
selling.
However, it sent a warning signal to the domestic banks, and the refusal to
guarantee the level of lending for more than a day prompted a rise in a
number of short-term rates. Two-year bond yields rose to reflect concern
that short-term interest rates were on the turn.
All this was compounded by speculation that France was about to devalue the
currency, effectively decoupling from the ERM. OAT futures bounced back
sharply to close 0.18 higher at 119.92.
Mr Brian Hilliard, European economist with SGST said: 'French bond futures
bounced on rumours that the franc would be devalued and, although it seems
unlikely, there is a battle royal in the making.'
SPANISH government bond futures rose almost a full percentage point as a
crumbling peseta led to a strong belief that the country would soon be
forced to cut interest rates.
Unsupported by any central bank intervention, the peseta crashed through its
central ERM rate of 79.1172 against the D-Mark to hit Pta80. Dealers
scrambled into 10-year bonds futures partly to hedge against the currency
and partly to pre-empt what they considered an essential rate cut. The
September contract jumped 0.93 to 92.83.
GERMAN debt prices gained yesterday in spite of a host of worrying economic
data. Bund futures closed 0.28 up at 96.15.
The Bundesbank had already said it was unwilling to cut rates if, as
happened, monetary supply figures came in above central bank targets.
Economists also expect a disappointing inflation figure when regional
statistics begin to roll in either today or early next week.
If inflation has risen, there is no domestic justification to cut rates and
it remains to be seen whether the central bank will step in nevertheless to
relieve the ERM tension.
UK government bonds slipped in early trading ahead of last night's crucial
vote on the Social Chapter of the Maastricht Treaty.
Although international sellers were seen at all points of the yield curve,
the falls were overdone and a futures-led rally saw most maturities claw
back their losses with the short- and medium-dated stocks showing a net gain
by the close.
JAPANESE government bond prices fell on expectations of a boost in supply as
Japan's finance ministry offered Y800bn of 10-year government bonds
The latest issue, which has a 4.5 per cent coupon, reopens the two tranches
of the No 157 10-year bond to create a Y2,400bn issue likely to become the
next benchmark bond. The current benchmark, the JGB No 145 saw the yield
rise from 4.22 per cent at Thursday's close of dealing in London to 4.24 per
cent last night.
AFTER edging higher on encouraging comments on inflation from Federal
Reserve chairman Mr Alan Greenspan, US Treasury prices fell when he warned
interest rates would have to go up some time.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  13/16 at
106 1/32 , yielding 6.653 per cent. At the short end, the two-year note was
down  1/16 at 99 7/8 , to yield 4.175 per cent.
Prices were firmer in early trading following a bullish jobless claim report
showing a 24,000 jump in the number claiming state unemployment insurance
during the second week of July.
During uncertain mid-morning trading, longer-dated securities posted modest
gains after Mr Greenspan told Congress he saw no signs of inflation beyond
the limits of longer-term market expectations, which themselves seem to be
receding.
Bonds turned tail during the afternoon, however, once the market had
digested Mr Greenspan's remarks that an interest rate rise was 'somewhere
out there'. Although this was obvious, it was enough to unsettle a fragile
market. Even later, prices fell further on rumours that Mr Dan Rostenkowski,
a key figure in the Congressional negotiations over the deficit reduction
bill, was about to resign.

FT  23 JUL 93 / International Bonds: Attractive swap conditions spur Dollars
300m in FRN issues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB and AP-DJ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COLLARED floating-rate notes were the flavour of the international bond
market yesterday, as two borrowers - CSFB Finance and Commerzbank - launched
substantial new issues while a third, San Paolo, decided to increase its
recently-launched deal.
Dealers said attractive swap conditions yesterday prompted borrowers to go
for collared FRNs. Meanwhile, investor demand remains healthy because the
minimum coupons mean investors receive a fairly generous pick-up over
short-term dollar interest rates.
CSFB Finance launched a Dollars 150m, 10-year collared FRN with a coupon of
six-month Libor minus 12.5 basis points. The floor was set at 5.5 per cent
and the cap at 9.5 per cent.
CSFB, lead manager for the deal, reported strong demand for the bonds. It
said the price rose from 99.875 at issue to 100.75 by late afternoon. Market
participants agreed the deal went well, pointing out that retail investors
in Switzerland and the Benelux countries were familiar with the borrower's
name.
One US house said the appeal of the deal lay in its high cap, relatively
high floor, and its below-par pricing.
The market has seen a steady flow of collared FRN deals since last summer,
with the most recent issues generally having a 12-year maturity, a floor of
5 per cent and cap of 8 per cent.
Commerzbank launched a Dollars 150m, 12-year collared FRN late in the day,
setting the coupon at Libor minus 25 basis points with a floor of 5.25 per
cent and a cap of 8 per cent.
Meanwhile, San Paolo increased the size of its 10-year collared FRN deal by
Dollars 50m to Dollars 200m in response to strong investor demand.
Activity in other sectors of the international bond market was muted given
the approach of the holiday season and further bouts of turbulence in the
European exchange rate mechanism. There was some speculation that LKB
Baden-Wurttemberg was preparing to launch a Pounds 250m, five-year deal.
Credit Lyonnais, the French state-controlled bank, has placed Dollars 350m
in preference shares with US institutional investors, AP-DJ reports. The
shares were issued by Credit Lyonnais Capital, registered in Luxembourg, and
are considered to be a minority stake.
The preference shares have a nominal yield of 9.5 per cent, with a quarterly
dividend guaranteed by Credit Lyonnais. They are perpetual but can be
reimbursed in 10 years.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CHINA has appointed 19 banks and securities underwriters to be the country's
first treasury bond primary dealers, Reuter reports from Beijing.
The move formalises a system which officials hope will eventually dominate
government bond issuance in China and is part of a key reform to eliminate
the forced sale of treasury bonds.
The 19 firms, led by the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, will be
the primary marketers of this year's Yn2bn issue of treasury bonds.
The issue, part of this year's overall Yn30bn of treasury issues, marks an
advance in China's efforts to develop Western-style controls over its
rapidly-evolving financial system.
Officials said primary dealers would be obliged to 'maintain normal
operations' in the still-informal secondary market by increasing liquidity.

FT  23 JUL 93 / International Capital Markets: Banks, brokers criticise
Japanese futures controls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A GROUP of international and domestic financial institutions has criticised
Japan's financial watchdogs for their heavy regulation of stock market
futures, which were widely blamed in Japan for the 1991 stock market crash.
Leading brokers and banks in Tokyo, including SG Warburg Securities, Salomon
Brothers and Long Term Credit Bank, claim the implementation of restrictions
on stock futures trading had reduced liquidity in the futures market and
increased volatility on the cash market.
Their forum, the Committee to Make Tokyo Financial Markets More Transparent
and International (CTTI), says in a report tight regulations are responsible
for undermining Tokyo's credibility as an international financial centre.
It says regulation has led to an increasing number of investors shifting
stock futures trades to overseas markets, including the Singapore
International Monetary Exchange (Simex).
Nikkei 225 index futures trading, along with arbitrage trading against the
underlying cash stock market, has been blamed for violent price movements in
the cash market, driving ordinary investors away. To reduce trading volume
on the futures market, the financial authorities raised margin requirements
and commission over the past two years.
The Bank of Japan has also challenged the notion that the weakness of the
cash market was triggered by futures transactions. In a report released
earlier this year, the Bank of Japan noted the lack of evidence that futures
price movements exaggerated price fluctuations on the cash market.
The ministry of finance and the Tokyo and Osaka stock exchanges are now
working on a new capitalisation-weighted index to replace the Nikkei 225.
The Nikkei, as a simple price average of 225 stocks, is seen as easily
manipulated.
The new index, expected to be introduced in October, is likely to represent
350 stocks rather than the current 225. Some traders speculate that the
index may be weighted by trading volume or the level of free-floating
shares, rather than according to full market capitalisation. This is because
a bulk of the shares are held in cross shareholdings.
While the forum agreed the new index may alleviate some problems - such as
the impact of arbitrage trading on the prices of specific low-liquidity
stocks - it could not see it instantly resolving other difficulties, such as
continued low turnover on the cash market or the fall in share prices.
For the cash stock market to regain its health, the committee urged that
rather than regulating the futures market, authorities should further
deregulate high-fixed commissions on stock transactions, cut the stock
transfer tax, and replace the illiquid index.

FT  23 JUL 93 / International Company News: Texaco doubles second-term
profit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A RISE in natural gas prices in the US and a further improvement in refining
and marketing margins enabled Texaco to double net profit in the second
quarter compared with a depressed quarter last year.
But Mr Alfred McCrane, chairman, warned: 'The international petroleum
industry is faced with continuing uncertain world economic conditions, as
well as the oversupply of crude oil,' which has pushed oil prices down by
Dollars 3 a barrel since May.
He added that attention to controlling costs and other operational
improvements 'will be particularly important in the forward period'.
Post-tax profits reached Dollars 309m, or Dollars 1.10 a share, compared
with Dollars 151m, or 49 cents, a year ago. First-half net income was up
from Dollars 383m (before the effect of a Dollars 300m charge reflecting an
accounting change) to Dollars 587m.
second-quarter operating profits of Dollars 419m, up from Dollars 294m, were
bolstered by Dollars 163m from oil and gas exploration and production in the
US, up from Dollars 112m on the back of natural gas prices which recovered
from low 1992 levels.
Upstream activities abroad returned an operating profit of Dollars 82m,
against Dollars 46m, after benefiting from higher production in the Middle
East and Indonesia.
Refining and marketing operating profits fell from Dollars 77m to Dollars
63m in the US, reflecting 'excess supplies of refined products' on the US
east and Gulf coasts.
The international downstream operating result, aided by stronger margins in
Latin America, rose from Dollars 61m to Dollars 120m. Petrochemicals
suffered an operating loss of Dollars 7m (a Dollars 2m profit a year ago)
due to higher feedstock and energy costs. Lower interest costs and
cost-cutting reduced non-operating expenses by Dollars 53m to Dollars 210m.
Higher natural gas prices also boosted Occidental Petroleum, pushing
second-quarter net income to Dollars 75m, or 21 cents a share, up from
Dollars 50m, or 16 cents, in the same period of 1992. Net income for the
half year was Dollars 155m, against a loss of Dollars 87m last time when the
company took a Dollars 93m charge for an accounting change.
Second-quarter operating profits from oil and gas of Dollars 130m, up from
Dollars 79m, were boosted by Dollars 55m from a tax refund and disposal of a
stake in Trident NGL. In 1992, figures had been lifted by Dollars 35m from a
litigation settlement.
Amoco, the US oil and gas group, exceeded analysts' expectations with
second-quarter net income of Dollars 487m, or 98 cents a share, compared
with Dollars 216m, or 43 cents, before restructuring charges a year ago.
The figures were boosted by higher earnings from US exploration and
production, due mainly to higher gas prices, and an improvement in costs in
refining and marketing, said Mr Laurance Fuller, chairman.
Due to higher gas prices, operating profits from US exploration and
production rose to Dollars 293m before a Dollars 63m charge for
environmental clean-up costs, from Dollars 154m in the 1992 quarter. Lower
exploration costs and favourable exchange movements pushed operating profits
on foreign upstream activities to Dollars 53m, compared with a loss of
Dollars 27m a year ago.
First-half operating income was Dollars 830m, or Dollars 1.67 a share,
compared with Dollars 473m, or 95 cents, a year ago, before the effects in
1992 of charges related to restructuring and accounting changes.

LOTUS Development, the US personal computer software company, reported a net
loss for the second quarter after charges for the cost of acquiring a
data-base software company.
Net losses for the quarter were Dollars 4.7m, or 11 cents a share, compared
with net income of Dollars 14.9m, or 34 cents, in last year's corresponding
quarter.
During the quarter, Lotus completed the acquisition of Approach Software, a
privately held software developer. A substantial portion of the cost,
Dollars 19.9m, was recorded as a charge against second quarter earnings,
Before the charge, net income was Dollars 15.2m, or 35 cents a share.
Revenue for the quarter was Dollars 235.8m, up 7 per cent from Dollars
220.3m last time.
For the year to date Lotus reported net income of Dollars 7.6m, or 18 cents
a share, compared with net income of Dollars 35.7m, or 81 cents, in the
first half of 1992. Before the acquisition charge, net income from
operations for the 1993 half year was Dollars 27.5m, or 64 cents, a 23 per
cent decline.
Revenues for the six-month period increased 3 per cent to Dollars 462.8m
from Dollars 447.4m.
'Results for the quarter exceeded our expectations,' said Mr Jim Manzi,
president and chief executive. 'The strong increase in our Windows
applications sales, for example, more than offset the decline in revenue
from our DOS products.
'The second quarter was one of the most significant in our company's
history,' he added.

DELTA Air Lines, one of the big three American carriers, yesterday
underscored the improving trend of US airline profitability by reporting net
income of Dollars 7.1m in its fourth quarter, compared with a Dollars 180m
net loss in the same period of last year.
The figures, which translated into a loss per share of 41 cents, down from
Dollars 3.72, came a day after American Airlines, the largest US carrier,
and USAir also reported a return to profit after a prolonged recession in
the industry and a fare war. The figures were better than most analysts had
been expecting.
Mr Ronald Allen, chairman of Delta, said the group's financial performance
in 1993 was 'unacceptable', even though it represented an improvement on the
previous year.
Delta also announced that, as part of an efficiency drive, it was
eliminating 13 management positions - seven vice-presidents and six
assistant vice-presidents. Some incumbents intended to retire, others would
be re-assigned. Since May last year the group has cut its staff by 7.7 per
cent, or 6,200 jobs.
For the full year, Delta lost Dollars 369.7m, or Dollars 9.41 a share, For
the full year, Delta lost Dollars 369.7m, or Dollars 9.41 a share, against a
loss of Dollars 506.3m, or Dollars 10.60, in 1992. Including the effect of
accounting changes, it lost Dollars 1bn, or Dollars 22.32 a share, in 1993.
In the latest quarter, operating revenues totalled Dollars 3.13bn, up 11 per
cent on the same period of 1992. Passenger revenue grew 10 per cent to
Dollars 2.9bn, thanks to 5 per cent growth in traffic to 20.9bn revenue
passenger miles and a 5 per cent improvement in the passenger mile yield
(the average price paid by each passenger to fly one mile) to 13.86 cents.
Operating expenses totalled Dollars 3.07bn, down 0.6 per cent. Salaries rose
less than 1 per cent.

BLOCKBUSTER Entertainment, the acquisitive video rental company which owns
the Cityvision chain in the UK, yesterday posted a 56 per cent rise in
second-quarter net income to Dollars 47.7m, or 23 cents a share.
A year earlier, the Florida-based company reported net income of Dollars
30m, or 17 cents. Revenues, including those from franchise-owned video
stores, climbed to Dollars 654.1m from Dollars 448.1m.
The improved earnings and sales performance was struck on the back of strong
gains in video rental sales and a better contribution from its music
business.
For the first half, Blockbuster earned Dollars 49.9m, or 43 cents on sales
of Dollars 1.26bn, compared with profits of Dollars 55.6m, or 31 cents, on
revenues of Dollars 894.4m.
Blockbuster expanded aggressively in the second quarter, acquiring a 21.3
per cent stake in Discovery Zones, which owns and franchises children's
fitness centres. It also acquired franchise rights to develop 50 Discovery
Zone FunCenters in the US and formed a joint venture to develop 10
FunCenters in the UK.

<TEXT>
BANKAMERICA, the second biggest US bank, saw only a slight improvement in
second-quarter earnings compared with the first three months of the year.
The bank was held back by the slow economic recovery in California, its home
market.
It recorded second-quarter net income of Dollars 488m, or Dollars 1.20 a
share, compared with Dollars 484m, or Dollars 1.19, in the first three
months.
In the second quarter of 1992 it returned post-tax profits of Dollars 240m,
after restructuring charges following its merger with Security Pacific.
Excluding non-recurring factors, net income in the second quarter of 1992
was Dollars 421m, or Dollars 1.19 a share, the company said.
The gains were less than those shown recently by other big US banks, which
have generally seen a faster improvement in credit quality and bigger gains
in trading revenues.
Mr Richard Rosenberg, chairman, called the figures 'encouraging' and pointed
to improved credit quality in its loan portfolio and 'higher levels of
customer activity in some market segments to-wards the end of the quarter'.
He added that economic conditions, particularly in California, were likely
to limit revenue growth, leading to greater attention to the bank's costs.
Net interest before provisions for credit losses of Dollars 200m (down from
Dollars 235m in the first quarter and Dollars 240m a year ago) was Dollars
1.85bn, an increase of Dollars 9m over the first quarter.
By the end of June the bank held Dollars 996m of assets intended for sale,
Dollars 890m less than three months ago largely as a result of a bulk sale
of properties to a Morgan Stanley property fund.
Non-interest income fell by Dollars 31m during the quarter to Dollars
1.05bn, although this was more than accounted for by Dollars 38m of
non-recurring gains in the earlier period.

Dollars 30m rise in net revenue from equity investments largely accounted
for the improvement.
Higher revenues from trading in financial markets were offset by a sharp
rise in bonuses and other staff incentives and benefits, which were up by a
half from a year before to Dollars 303m.
The quarterly result pushed return on equity at an annualised rate to nearly
25 per cent, from 23 per cent last time.
First-half net income of Dollars 406m (after an accounting change which led
to a Dollars 75m charge) was up from Dollars 340m in the first half of 1992.
Net interest income - which includes trading-related gains associated with
interest rate and currency arbitrage - rose 27 per cent to Dollars 319m.
Non-interest revenues were up by 21 per cent to Dollars 832m, helped by a
rise in trading profits from Dollars 335m to Dollars 405m.
The Dollars 30m rise in net revenue from equity investments was partly
offset by other factors, including losses from the revaluation of
non-trading currency positions, resulting in total additions to non-interest
income of Dollars 70m against Dollars 37m a year earlier.
Mr Charles Sanford, chairman, said the figures demonstrated the consistency
of earnings across the company.

ABITIBI-Price cut its losses sharply in the second quarter, helped by firmer
newsprint prices, a lower Canadian dollar and reduced operating costs.
Newsprint sales rose 17 per cent but uncoated groundwood papers were weak.
Net loss was CDollars 18.2m (USDollars 14.2m), or 27 cents a share, against
a loss of CDollars 37.5m, or 55 cents, a year earlier. Sales rose 19 per
cent to CDollars 493m.
The first-half loss was CDollars 47m, or 69 cents, against a deficit of
CDollars 75.4m or CDollars 1.11 a year ago, on sales of CDollars 964m, up 21
per cent.

Maytag climb 12%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MAYTAG, the US appliances group which owns Hoover Europe, reported a 12 per
cent increase in second-quarter net income, helped by more efficient
production in North America.
It reported net income of Dollars 21.3m, or 20 cents a share, compared with
Dollars 18.9m, or 18 cents, in the same period of last year - in spite of a
rise in its effective tax rate from 36 per cent to 41.6 per cent.
Sales totalled Dollars 753.3m, down 2.2 per cent, which the company said was
due to currency conversion factors, the sale of its microwave oven business,
and lower vending equipment sales.
Its North American appliance group had operating income of Dollars 53.1m, up
34 per cent. But the increase was due partly to depressed 1992 results
because of plant start-up costs. Sales were up marginally at Dollars 568m.
Hoover Europe suffered an operating loss of Dollars 3.6m, down from Dollars
7.5m, while sales dropped 10.4 per cent, largely because of currency
conversion factors.
In the first quarter, Maytag took a Dollars 30m charge to cover the costs of
a Hoover travel promotion in the UK which backfired. First-half net income,
including that charge, totalled Dollars 10.8m, compared with a Dollars 263m
loss last year after accounting changes.

FT  23 JUL 93 / International Company News: Sales volumes push Pfizer to 15%
rise in quarter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PFIZER, the US pharmaceuticals group, recorded a 15 per cent rise in
post-tax profits in the second quarter, to Dollars 253.8m. The result was
attributed to higher sales volumes and a net gain of Dollars 27m from
non-recurring items.
A 3 per cent increase in turnover from a year ago, to Dollars 1.75bn, was
driven almost entirely by higher volume, with modest price rises largely
offset by currency factors.
Earnings per share rose to 79 cents a share (73 cents excluding the net gain
from the share sale), up from 66 cents a year ago.
First-half net income of Dollars 582.8m was ahead of the Dollars 234.6m of
the first six months of 1992, which was struck after accounting changes
reduced reported results by Dollars 283m. Pharmaceutical sales at
Bristol-Myers Squibb fell 1 per cent during the second quarter compared with
a year ago. The company blamed the drop on lower sales of its Capoten
cardiovascular drug and government cost-containment measures in Germany and
Italy.
However, sales of consumer healthcare products, medical devices and
nutritional products all rose strongly, resulting in a 3 per cent growth in
sales overall, to Dollars 2.8bn.
Net earnings rose to Dollars 520m, or Dollars 1.01 a share, up from Dollars
488m, or 92 cents a share, in the same period in 1992.

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DOW Chemical, the second biggest US chemicals group, yesterday unveiled a 28
per cent drop in second-quarter operating income. The decline reflected the
poor performance of its personal care division and a large pre-tax charge at
Marion Merrell Dow, the pharmaceuticals group which is 71 per cent owned by
Dow.
Stripping out Dow's portion of the charge and other extraordinary items, the
company earned Dollars 205m, or 75 cents a share, against Dollars 193m, or
71 cents a year earlier. Including one-time items, Dow net income was
Dollars 149m, or 54 cents, in the latest quarter.
It blamed flat volume and a 1 per cent price decline for its weaker sales in
the quarter, which fell to Dollars 4.82bn from Dollars 4.86bn in the 1992
period.
This month Dow said Marion Merrill would take charges to cover cost-cutting
measures aimed at saving about Dollars 250m a year. The group has been hit
by sliding sales of its Nicoderm smoking patch and the expiry of patents of
its best-selling product.
Dow's consumer specialities business saw underlying operating income drop 9
per cent in the quarter on sales which fell 5 per cent. Including the Marion
Merrell Dow charge, operating income for the business plunged 57 per cent.
Chemical and performance products posted a 29 per cent improvement in
operating income to Dollars 110m on flat sales of Dollars 1.1bn. Plastics
operations operating income rose 12 per cent on sales which eased 1 per cent
to Dollars 1.7bn.
Hydrocarbons and energy had operating earnings of Dollars 5m in the quarter,
against an operating loss of Dollars 48m, while sales rose 19 per cent to
Dollars 454m.
For the first half, Dow had net income of Dollars 551m, or Dollars 2.01,
compared with a loss of Dollars 394m, or Dollars 1.46. Last year's results
included a charge of Dollars 765m for accounting changes.

</HEADLINE>

   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SCHERING-PLOUGH, the US healthcare group, reported second-quarter profits up
18 per cent from Dollars 184m to Dollars 213m. Turnover rose 10 per cent
from Dollars 1.02bn to Dollars 1.12bn. Excluding changes in exchange rates,
sales would have increased 11 per cent.
'Schering-Plough is performing extremely well, even as its US and
international markets daily grow more challenging,' said Mr Robert Luciano,
chief executive and chairman.
'We expect solid growth in 1993 as Claritin continues to gain sales and
market share in the US and as our most significant products progress
internationally,' he added.
The group's pharmaceuticals division reported sales up 12 per cent for the
quarter. International turnover was particularly strong, up 18 per cent,
while domestic sales rose 6 per cent. For the first six months turnover in
the drugs division rose from Dollars 1.63bn to Dollars 1.81bn.
Intron A, a new treatment for hepatitis C, Claritin, a non-sedating
anti-histamine, and Eulexin, a therapy for prostate cancer, all generated
impressive growth, said the company. However, domestic sales of Proventil, a
line of asthma products, fell, primarily because of generic competition.
Turnover at the Wesley-Jessen vision care business fell compared with the
1992 second quarter, due to lower sales of coloured contact lenses and the
sale in May 1992 of its domestic contact lens solutions business.
The healthcare division, which includes over-the-counter products, sun-care
and foot-care products, increased turnover 3 per cent.
Sales of sun-care products increased, but over-the-counter business fell due
to the increasingly competitive environment for anti-fungal products.
For the first half, sales by the healthcare division dropped from Dollars
408m to Dollars 405m.

LIBERTY Life, the big South African life insurance group, plans to raise
R1bn (Dollars 300m) by floating 20 per cent of its investment portfolio
subsidiary on the local stock market.
The company to be floated is Liblife Strategic Investments (Libsil). The
market value of its investment portfolio, which includes stakes in some of
South Africa's leading blue chip companies, is around R5.6bn.
Mr Donald Gordon, chairman, said half of the flotation proceeds would be
used to redeem preference shares in Libsil with the balance used to develop
Liberty Life's mainstream insurance business.
The Libsil portfolio includes a 23.8 per cent holding in Stanbic, South
Africa's leading banking group; 9.4 per cent of South African Breweries; and
23.4 per cent of the Premier Group, the food company.
It also has a 4.6 per cent in Gold Fields of South Africa, the mining house
with some of the richest gold mines.
The listing, one of the largest in South Africa, will be of R560m ordinary
shares in Libsil. The shares have a net asset value of about R10 each.

<TEXT>
MR JOSEPH PERELLA, one of the most prominent figures in US investment
banking, is leaving Wasserstein, Perella, the firm he formed with Bruce
Wasserstein in 1988.
'Wasserella' was involved in many of the biggest deals of the 1980s,
including Time's Dollars 13.4bn bid for Warner Communications and the
Dollars 25bn bid by Kohlberg, Kravis Roberts for RJR Nabisco. In 1989, the
firm fought for control of the UK's Gateway, and later invested a third of
its Dollars 1.1bn buy-out fund in subscribing for a 40 per cent share of
Isosceles' equity.
The firm's profile has fallen sharply in recent years, and several of
Wasserella's top investment bankers have defected. Mr Perella, who has
started working with Mr Wasserstein at First Boston in 1977, has threatened
to quit in the past. Yesterday he said he wanted to seek challenges and new
business ventures.

MCDONALD'S, the world's biggest hamburger chain, yesterday posted a 14 per
cent rise in second-quarter earnings on sales which rose 11 per cent and
said it was on track with its plan to achieve double-digit earnings growth.
In the three months to June 30, the company earned Dollars 288.8m, or 78
cents a share on sales of Dollars 5.96bn compared with profits Dollars
254.1m, or 69 cents on sales of Dollars 5.39bn in the same period of 1992.
Revenues, which are less than sales because of franchising agreements, were
6 per cent higher at Dollars 1.88bn in the latest quarter. Operating income
grew 8 per cent to Dollars 517.8m from Dollars 478m a year ago.
For the first six months, McDonald's had net income of Dollars 507.1m, or
Dollars 1.35 on sales of Dollars 11.19bn against earnings of Dollars 441.5m,
or Dollars 1.20 on sales of Dollars 10.3bn the previous year.
Revenues rose 4 per cent to Dollars 3.53bn from Dollars 3.39bn.
The Illinois-based company said its international business was helped by
expansion and higher sales at existing restaurants, but was hurt by weaker
foreign currencies.
Sales outside the US rose 15 per cent in the quarter. US sales grew 8 per
cent in the quarter while operating income rose 4 per cent.
The company said it had excellent sales results in many European countries
and attributed its success in weak economies to the value of its meals.
In England, 'sales growth over the past several quarters has been
noteworthy', the company said.
In Japan, however, McDonald's blamed a weak economy for soft sales.
Operating income outside the US rose 15 per cent in the quarter.
The company said higher general, administrative and selling expenses partly
offset higher franchised margins.

Mr Dan Tellep, chairman, attributed the improvement to a strong aeronautical
systems group performance, while profits were p slightly for the missiles

Funded sign-ups of new and follow-on orders were p sharply due to Fort

GOLD mines in the Anglo American group, the world's largest gold producer,
increased available profit by 19.7 per cent to R251.1m (Dollars 76m) in the
June quarter, compared with the preceding March quarter.
The profits advance stemmed from higher production - up by 1.1 per cent to
67,803kg - a 4.7 per cent increase in average revenue to R36,327 per kg and
a modest increase in total working costs to R1.83bn from R1.79bn.
Although the impact of hedging dilutes the full benefit of the recent firm
gold price on profits, the large dividend increases at some mines - up by
155 per cent at Western Deep Levels and 100 per cent at Elandsrand - are a
clear indication of the better times in the industry.
All five mines in the group increased profits after tax and capital
expenditure.
Available profit rose by 11 per cent at Freegold to R102.5m: by 27 per cent
to R70.7m at Vaal Reefs: by 17 per cent to R38.1m at Western Deep Levels: by

FT  23 JUL 93 / International Company News: Loan leak dampens Barito
flotation hopes - The struggle to go public facing Indonesia's largest
timber group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM KEELING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BARITO Pacific Timber may rue the day it decided to go public. In the last
month, the company has suffered a spate of poor publicity, culminating in
the withdrawal this week of Salomon Brothers, the US securities house, as
the issue's lead foreign co-ordinator.
Looking to raise about Dollars 250m, its flotation - planned for October -
would make Barito the second largest company on the Jakarta Stock Exchange,
with a market value of about Dollars 2.5bn. It would allow investors a share
in Indonesia's largest integrated timber processor, accounting for 16 per
cent of the world market in plywood.
The company says it made a gross profit of Rp231bn (Dollars 112m) last year
on net sales of Rp769bn and forecasts a Rp547bn gross profit this year on
substantially higher sales of Rp1,157bn. Its timber concessions, at over 5m
hectares, make up an area greater than Switzerland.
Despite such bullish forecasts, the company has been forced on to the
defensive following the leaking of a document, published in the local press
and allegedly compiled by the government, listing its parent Barito Pacific
Group as a large borrower from the state banks.
The Barito Pacific Group contains over 100 subsidiaries - ranging from
timber to palm oil, petrochemicals to banking - in which Mr Prajogo
Pangestu, chairman, is a shareholder. Executives estimate the group's 1992
turnover at about Dollars 2.5bn.
Mr Pangestu denies the group carries any unserviced loans and says the state
banks have written letters confirming it is current on all debt. Colleagues
of Mr Pangestu express disappointment that government officials have refused
to deny the leaked document's authenticity.
However, poor publicity continued last week when Mr Pangestu was summoned to
parliament. He was asked to explain a deal, announced on July 7 but signed
in February, in which Taspen, a state pension fund, took a 20 per cent stake
in Barito Pacific Timber for Rp375bn.
The deal valued the company at Rp3,000 a share, compared to the anticipated
Rp7,200 price at which the planned flotation is to be set. Barito says all
procedures were correctly followed but the government has announced a review
of the transaction.
The withdrawal of Salomon Brothers on Monday at the start of a two-week
international roadshow has further hindered the company's ability to market
its flotation.
Brokers say Indonesian regulations limiting disclosure - including details
of Mr Pangestu's majority shareholding in the company - may have resulted in
Salomon having insufficient information to satisfy US regulatory
authorities.
The flotation will proceed, stress officials close to Barito, who say Crosby
Securities, which specialises in Asian markets, and Schroders, the UK
investment bank, will replace Salomon as co-ordinator of the foreign
placement.
Brokers say Bank Bumi Daya and Bapindo, two Indonesian state-owned banks,
will back the issue and Barito's supporters argue that the company is coming
to the market at an auspicious time, just as world timber prices are rising.
The world price of plywood and blockboard, Barito's main products, has risen
from about Dollars 320 per cubic metre in January to Dollars 520 in the
August spot market.
The company says 55 per cent of the funds raised by the flotation will be
invested in a 500,000 tonnes a year pulp and paper mill in South Sumatra to
be owned by Tanjung Enin Lestari, in which Barito has a 40 per cent stake.
Tanjung Enin Lestari is a joint-venture with Citra Lamtoro Gung, led by
President Suharto's eldest daughter. The remaining funds will be split
between developing industrial forest concessions and paying down Barito
debt.
Barito's critics, however, say it will struggle to attract foreign investors
and that the backing of international financial institutions is not secure.
As one potential financial backer explained yesterday: 'Items still need to
be disclosed by Barito. We . . . do not feel comfortable with the
information provided on affiliated companies and the debt positions.'
Barito Pacific Timber's debt was Dollars 584m at the end of 1992 but Mr
Pangestu has declined to reveal the parent group's total borrowings on the
grounds of banking secrecy. 'I know exactly how big our loan exposure is but
I cannot disclose this to the public,' he said.
Some potential investors are concerned about Mr Pangestu's management style.
Barito directors say they will provide prudent management. Mr Pangestu 'has
been in business long enough to know the importance of his management team
and their opinions count', noted one executive.
The board, however, supported Mr Pangestu's request in January for a Rp150bn
loan from Barito Pacific Timber to buy a stake in Astra International,
Indonesia's largest automotive company.
Mr Pangestu has pledged his Astra shares as collateral and made a personal
guarantee of repayment. The loan was 'just like any other transaction that
we have', explained a Barito director.

SALMOND Smith Biolab yesterday launched a shares and cash NZDollars 28m
(USDollars 15.4m) takeover bid for rival New Zealand fish farmer, Regal
Salmon.
The bid follows a fall in the Regal Salmon share price following a turnround
in earnings from a NZDollars 2m profit last year to a NZDollars 3.3m loss in
the year ended March.
Regal Salmon shares have fallen from a high of NZDollars 2.60 late last year
to around 80 cents prior to the bid.

FT  23 JUL 93 / International Company News: Liberty Life to float stake in
investment unit

<TEXT>
LIBERTY Life, the big South African life insurance group, plans to raise
R1bn (Dollars 300m) by floating 20 per cent of its investment portfolio
subsidiary on the local stock market.
The company to be floated is Liblife Strategic Investments (Libsil). The
market value of its investment portfolio, which includes stakes in some of
South Africa's leading blue chip companies, is around R5.6bn.
Mr Donald Gordon, chairman, said half of the flotation proceeds would be
used to redeem preference shares in Libsil with the balance used to develop
Liberty Life's mainstream insurance business.
Mr Gordon explained that the transaction provides greater transparency about
Liberty's strategic holdings, thus making them more attractive to investors.
Mr Gordon feels that - once financial sanctions against the country
disappear - there is potential for a considerable flow of portfolio funds
into South African equities.
He believes Libsil would be an attractive destination for such funds since
it has large holdings in some of South Africa's largest blue chip companies
which are traditionally very tightly held.
The Libsil portfolio includes a 23.8 per cent holding in Stanbic, South
Africa's leading banking group; 9.4 per cent of South African Breweries, the
consumer goods company; and 23.4 per cent of the Premier Group, the food
company.
It also has a 4.6 per cent in Gold Fields of South Africa, the mining house
with some of the richest gold mines. Libsil does not hold Liberty's
strategic offshore holdings.
The listing, one of the largest in South Africa, will be of R560m ordinary
shares in Libsil. The shares have a net asset value of about R10 each.
The move will allow Liberty to redeem expensive debentures and invest the
balance in a manner that would earn substantially higher returns that Libsil
was offering.

THREE foreign companies yesterday applied to delist from the Tokyo Stock
Exchange's foreign section. The move is scheduled for October 30.
The three are Warner-Lambert and Bellsouth of the US, and Dixons of the UK.
They will take the number of delistings since 1992 to 13, including General
Motors of the US, Philips of the Netherlands and Royal Bank of Canada.
The three companies said high costs and administrative burdens were the main
reason for ending their Tokyo presence.
The fall in trading activity has also become a concern for foreign
companies, which have primarily listed in Tokyo to enhance their
international profile.
Shares traded in Tokyo peaked in 1987 with a daily average of 2.76m shares
traded: daily volume fell to some 200,000 shares this year.
Tokyo trading in foreign stocks started in 1973. The latest delistings will
reduce the number of listed companies to 111, down from a peak of 127 in
late 1991.

property tender plan

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NATIONAL Australia Bank, the Australian financial services group, plans a
sealed bid tender programme to sell about ADollars 143m (USDollars 97m)
worth of commercial and residential property.
Under the plan, the first time such a system has been used, the bank will
offer for sale 41 properties throughout Australia, which it holds as
mortgagee in possession.
If successful, the tender strategy may prove attractive to other major
Australian banks which have combined problem property loans of more than
ADollars 10bn, although only some of these are held as mortgagee in
possession.
The obvious advantage of the tender process to the NAB is an increased
possibility of selling properties en masse rather than piecemeal. Mr Michael
Johnstone, group manager of the NAB's property finance division, believes
the process has advantages for potential buyers.
He said properties had appraised values varying between ADollars 400,000 and
ADollars 16.2m, with estimated yields ranging from 13 to 21 per cent.

FT  23 JUL 93 / International Company News: Vietnamese fund raises more than
expected
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALEXANDER NICOLL, Asia Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PROSPECT of rapid development in Vietnam has prompted European
investment institutions to commit Dollars 44.6m to the Vietnam Fund, more
than double the amount it had been hoping to raise this year.
The offering, which closed yesterday, was the second by the Dublin-listed
fund, which is the only quoted vehicle for investment in Vietnam. The
response was in marked contrast to the initial offering in 1991, when it
managed to raise only Dollars 10m after seeking Dollars 30m.
Mr Martin Adams, managing director, said this year's plan had been to raise
Dollars 20m in Europe, and a further Dollars 2m later in the US, provided
that President Clinton lifted the American embargo on dealings with Hanoi.
However, the success of the issue in Europe means the fund now has no plans
to raise further capital.
The Vietnam Fund, which takes significant minority stakes in projects
producing hard currency or with foreign involvement, has committed its
existing cash to agricultural and real estate projects.
The new offering of shares, at 13.9 per cent above the net asset value of
Dollars 9.88, is partly paid, providing about Dollars 19m of cash now and
the remainder of the Dollars 44.6m after a year.
Mr Adams said a dozen projects were expected to be considered by the fund's
investment committee in the next six months.
Though Vietnam has long been thought to offer huge promise, the US embargo
has severely hampered the country's development, despite the government's
programme of market-oriented economic reforms.
However, President Clinton announced this month that he would remove a US
block on Vietnam repaying its arrears to the International Monetary Fund,
clearing the way for the IMF, World Bank and Asian Development Bank to
resume lending.

<TEXT>
AMERICAN Telephone &amp; Telegraph, the US communications and computer group,
yesterday reported an 8.6 per cent rise in second-quarter net income while
MCI Communications, its chief long-distance rival, reported flat net income
after an extraordinary charge.
AT&amp;T had net income of Dollars 1.04bn, or 77 cents a share, on revenues of
Dollars 16.3bn, compared with Dollars 961m, or 72 cents, on revenues of
Dollars 15.8bn in the same period of last year.
MCI, in which British Telecom is planning to take a 20 per cent stake,
reported net income of Dollars 150m, or 27 cents, on revenues of Dollars
2.93bn, against income of Dollars 149m, or 26 cents, on revenues of Dollars
2.61bn.
However, MCI's net figure included a Dollars 28m extraordinary charge for
the early retirement of debt. Without that, income rose 19 per cent to
Dollars 178m, while earnings per share were 23 per cent ahead at 32 cents.
AT&amp;T, which announced a big management shake-up yesterday, said its core
long-distance telecommunications services business saw calling volume grow
more than 5 per cent. However, revenues in this business were flat with a
year ago because customers chose lower priced services and adjustments to
revenue estimates for earlier periods.
Products and systems, which encompass its manufacturing operations, saw a
Dollars 166m rise in revenues at network communications products, led by
switching and cable systems, with most of the increase coming from sales to
US telephone companies.
NCR, its computer business, suffered a drop in operating income to Dollars
27m from Dollars 98m because of pricing pressure throughout the industry and
higher sales of lower-margin products.
The group's financial services revenue rose nearly 39 per cent, led by its
Universal credit card. Costs grew by only Dollars 70m, resulting in 'solid
margin improvements in all major service and product categories'.
For the six months, AT&amp;T reported net income of Dollars 2.04bn, or Dollars
1.51, excluding accounting changes, compared with Dollars 1.84bn, or Dollars
1.39, last year.
MCI, which has been eating away at AT&amp;T's long distance market share, said
its traffic increased by 13 per cent in the quarter.
For the six months, MCI reported net income of Dollars 301m, or 55 cents,
after Dollars 45m of extraordinary items, against Dollars 290m, or 52 cents,
in the same period of 1992.

FT  23 JUL 93 / International Company News: Munich Re maintains dividend as
loss widens
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MUNCHENER Ruckver-sicherung (Munich Re), Europe's largest insurance group,
is to pay an unchanged annual dividend, in spite of heavier losses from
mainstream reinsurance business.
The company blamed the increase in losses on Hurricane Andrew, which hit the
south-east of the US last summer and mounting car theft.
Munich Re gave no figure but the loss is likely to be in the region of DM1bn
(Dollars 588m) after losses of more than DM900m last year.
The group said income from investments and from general insurance business
more than made up for the renewed loss and parent company profits would be
the same level as in the previous year.
This, Munich Re said, would enable the payment of a dividend of DM10 per
share - the fifth year in succession that the Munich-based group has paid
this dividend.
It voiced optimism about the future, saying that capacity in the world
reinsurance market was beginning to shrink after a number of years when the
industry was beleaguered by the double burden of excess capacity and a row
of natural disasters.
This began with Hurricane Hugo in 1989 followed by the winter storms in
1990, Typhoon Mireille in 1991 and Hurricane Andrew last summer.
Munich Re said that after this period of disastrous conditions for the
reinsurance industry there was a chance of a substantial improvement in
prices for reinsurance coverage.
There had been a noticeable improvement in prices and conditions for
reinsurance and the trend was expected to continue throughout the current
year, Munich Re said.
The company warned that at the group level, there would be a small decline
in 1992-93 earnings as investment and other income had not fully offset
mainstream underwriting losses.
Last year, group net earnings were DM177.6m, nearly 70 per cent up on the
previous year.
Group premium income for 1992-93 increased by 11 per cent to about DM25bn,
Munich Re said.
Premium income at the parent company rose to DM16bn from DM14.6bn in
1991-92.
Total group investments climbed 6 per cent to DM76bn by the end of June.
Munich Re will publish the full details of 1992-93 figures in October.

FT  23 JUL 93 / International Company News: Brokerage lifts Salomon to
record second quarter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SALOMON, the US securities house and energy trading group, yesterday
reported record second-quarter profits of Dollars 433m following a strong
performance from its Wall Street brokerage unit.
Salomon's impressive second-quarter profits, which smashed the previous
three-month record of Dollars 273m set in the first quarter of 1991,
represented a rebound from the Dollars 102m net loss incurred in the first
quarter.
Earnings were up sharply from the same period a year ago, when the group
posted profits of Dollars 211m. That figure, however, was affected by a
Dollars 185m charge to cover costs related to the 1991 Treasury auction
scandal.
Yesterday's results underlined the capricious nature of Salomon's earnings,
which swing wildly from quarter to quarter because of the brokerage unit's
reliance on trading its own capital in the financial markets, and because of
the volatility of the energy divisions' earnings.
The second-quarter results would have looked even better but for two
separate charges Salomon took in the quarter, one of Dollars 45m to cover a
reduction in leased office space in New York and Tokyo, and another of
Dollars 20m for a write-down of the group's investment in White Knights, the
troubled oil production joint venture in Siberia.
The biggest contribution to Salomon's record quarter came from Salomon
Brothers, the Wall Street brokerage operation, which posted the strongest
earnings by a publicly-traded securities house.
Salomon Brothers' client-driven business, an area which includes stock, bond
and currency sales and trading, investment banking, asset management,
emerging markets and private client investment services, was particularly
productive.
Together, these businesses brought in Dollars 913m, more than double the
Dollars 462m earned a year earlier. The firm attributed the improvement to
favourable market conditions, internal changes, cost controls, and a
recovery of business that was lost following the Treasury auction scandal.
Revenues from the unit's other main business - the trading of financial
assets using the firm's own capital - totalled Dollars 523m, down from an
exceptional second quarter of 1992 but a healthy recovery from losses
incurred in the first three months of this year.
The strong performance from Salomon Brothers helped offset a poor quarter
from Phibro Energy, the group's oil products and commodities trading
operation, and Phibro USA, its oil refining operation, which reported
pre-tax earnings of Dollars 3m and Dollars 2m, respectively.

halfway

<TEXT>
BANCO Santander, the Spanish private bank, yesterday posted the biggest
first-half profit increase among the leading domestic institutions by
lifting net income 9.1 per cent to Pta47.1bn (Dollars 354.1m).
Mr Emilio Botin, the chairman, said the results were due to an expanding
customer base, increased international diversification, the stable trend in
its traditional business areas and strong results in its Treasury and
capital markets operations in Spain and abroad.
Santander raised its January-June return on assets to 1.31 per cent from
1.10 per cent in 1992, it increased its net profits by 11.8 per cent on the
preceding year, and its first-half return on assets to 25.81 per cent from
1992's 20.34 per cent.
The banking group's BIS capital adequacy ratio stands at 13.37 per cent.
Operating profit increased by 27.05 per cent to Pta72bn in spite of a 14 per
cent increase in operating costs that was due to expanded commercial
activities and to the impact of the peseta's devaluation on foreign currency
expenses.
The additional costs were offset by large earnings in the group's Treasury
and capital-market operations that lifted its ordinary income by 106.8 per
cent to Pta36.7bn.
Non-performing loans, which have been undermining the banking sector's
results in Spain, grew by 9.2 per cent in the first half of this year and
represent 3.48 per cent of the group's risk assets, up from from 3.16 per
cent.
Santander, which is a highly conservative bank, raised its provisions by
76.8 per cent to Pta37.6bn to keep its non-performing loan coverage at 100.2
per cent. Mr Botin welcomed the 'very satisfactory results' at First
Fidelity, the US bank in which Santander has a 19 per cent stake.
The group will pay a quarterly dividend of Pta62 per share on July 31.

FT  23 JUL 93 / International Company News: IRI unveils reorganisation plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IRI, the Italian state holding company which controls the Ilva steel group,
yesterday unveiled the outline of a restructuring plan designed to improve
the performance of its biggest loss-maker and overcome European Commission
objections to an earlier reorganisation project.
The proposal involves creating two new companies specialising in flat
products and stainless steels respectively.
The plan echoes some of the main elements of its predecessor, unveiled in
April, notably the retention of a core steel-making business based on Ilva's
big Taranto integrated steelworks and the Novi Ligure coated products plant.
The two units would form the basis for the new flat products company. The
second company would make stainless steels, which are produced at Ilva's big
Terni works in central Italy.
Significantly, the new plan makes no mention of Ilva's debts of L7,583bn
(Dollars 4.74bn).
The previous project entailed transferring much of the debt, along with some
steel-making facilities, to IRI, triggering a furious row from other
European steelmakers and the Commission.
IRI, which has itself appeared to change track since the appointment last
month of Mr Romano Prodi as chairman, hopes the new plan will overcome
Commission objections by stressing that all Ilva's activities are now for
sale.
Barclays, the UK banking group, has already been given a mandate to advise
on the disposal of Dalmine, the quoted tubes group, in which Ilva has a
majority stake.
Informal negotiations, predominantly with Italian private-sector
steelmakers, are also under way on selling stakes in both the flat products
and stainless steels companies. Any remaining Ilva businesses would be
either closed down or sold, said an IRI official.
Mr Prodi yesterday said IRI had already received expressions of interest for
some of its activities from both Italian and foreign steel groups.
This week, Mr Paolo Savona, the Italian industry minister, told a
parliamentary committee that details of the restructuring, based on the
outlines revealed yesterday, would be presented to the Commission by early
October.
Unlike the former proposal, it is likely that the new plan will be fleshed
out in collaboration with the Commission to prevent another clash over
financial aspects of the need for production cuts.
Alumix, the aluminium subsidiary of the state-owned Efim group, now in
voluntary liquidation, announced a reduced loss of L584bn last year against
L743bn in 1991.
It is unclear to what extent the improvement derived from
specially-subsidised electricity tariffs granted to much of the company's
smelting activities.

FT  23 JUL 93 / International Company News: Alphandery confirms first
sell-offs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
MR EDMOND Alphandery, the French economy minister, has confirmed that
Rhone-Poulenc, the chemicals group, and Banque Nationale de Paris, will be
the first of the four state-owned groups selected for privatisation to be
sold.
The government was considering privatising Elf-Aquitaine, the oil group, in
tranches, he was reported as saying in an interview published yesterday.
This was due to the size of the company which, with an estimated market
value of about FFr100bn (Dollars 17.2bn), was the largest of the four
companies named in Wednesday's privatisation shortlist.
Banque Hervet, the smallest company on the list, with an estimated market
value of FFr1bn, is to be sold privately, the economy ministry said. Credit
Commercial de France, which has built up a 34.4 per cent stake in Banque
Hervet, over the past year is expected to take control through an agreed
purchase of shares.
Last year, Banque Hervet took provisions of about FFr250m to cover bad
loans, particularly in the property market. As a result, the bank suffered
losses of FFr186m. It has net assets of FFr24bn and 1,600 employees.
BNP, Rhone-Poulenc and Elf, the three principal companies in the first batch
of privatisations, will be privatised through a public offer. Mr Alphandery
described the companies as the jewels of the economy and said that the
shortlist was the natural choice.
The economy minister said he was optimistic that the government would
achieve its target of FFr40bn of privatisation receipts by the end of the
year. 'The size of the market is not an obstacle because the Balladur bond
has already prepared the ground,' he said.
The Balladur bond, which was issued earlier this month and can be converted
into equity in privatised issues, has raised FFr110bn.
Mrs Pamela Harriman, the US ambassador to Paris, has expressed concern about
the 20 per cent limit on non-EC shareholdings of privatised companies.
Addressing a meeting of French and US businessmen earlier this week she
said: 'We would prefer to see no limit on such investments'.
However, investment analysts in Paris said that the limits on non-EC
investors would not necessarily be restrictive. 'Most big foreign
institutions have European operations which could buy shares in the French
companies,' said one analyst.

FT  23 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Managers buy remaining Survival shops
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SIX remaining shops of the collapsed Survival Group have been sold to
their managers in individual deals, joint administrators Buchler Phillips
Traynor said yesterday, writes Chris Tighe.
The six buy-outs, which will trade as separate entities, have bought stock,
fixtures and fittings and negotiations are in progress on their use of the
logo and trade names of the Survival Group.
The company, which was chaired by Mr John Ashcroft, former Coloroll group
chairman, went into administration in March with liabilities of Pounds 1.7m.
Buchler Phillips Traynor said that preferential creditors might receive a
small dividend; unsecured creditors, who are owed Pounds 1.5m, will receive
nothing.
Joint administrator Mr Ron Robinson said: 'The sale of outlets to their
respective managers was the best, if unusual, solution for Survival's
creditors and former employees'.
Mr Ashcroft and two partners bought a 72 per cent stake in Survival Aids,
subsequently renamed Survival Group, in 1990. It was his first acquisition
following Coloroll's collapse with debts of approximately Pounds 350m.
In March Mr Ashcroft said he held a minority interest in Survival Group, but
was its largest creditor.

FT  23 JUL 93 / UK Company News: BICC drops Andover flotation plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in BICC slipped 8p to 390p yesterday as the international cables and
construction group announced that it had cancelled its plans to float some
60 per cent of Andover Controls, its US subsidiary, on Nasdaq.
Mr Tim Sharp, for BICC, said the flotation - which at an issue price of
Dollars 15 would have given Andover a market capitalisation of Dollars 75m
(Pounds 50m) - would have had to go ahead 'in a very crowded and competitive
environment for new issues' and that it was thought that institutions
considered it 'not as attractive as others on offer'.
Mr Sharp said that BICC could have sent Andover back with a lower price tag,
but was not keen to accept a price that was not 'proper' for the business.
BICC wanted to float or dispose of Andover as part of its reversion to its
core, but Mr Sharp said it was the most successful of BICC's technology
companies and it was 'not a painful business to run'.
Andover designs heating, ventilation, air conditioning and lighting systems
for 'smart' buildings.

FT  23 JUL 93 / UK Company News: YRM ends year Pounds 1.98m in the red
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM DELLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES of YRM closed 3p lower at 37p yesterday, having touched 33p earlier
in the day, after the building design consultancy recorded its first-ever
annual loss and passed its final dividend.
When reporting an interim deficit of Pounds 498,000 in February, YRM said it
should be profitable in the second half. In the event it incurred full year
pre-tax losses of Pounds 1.98m, against previous profits of Pounds 1.38m, on
turnover down to Pounds 14.1m (Pounds 19.6m).
Mr Brian Henderson, chairman, attributed the losses for the 12 months to
April 30 to sharply increased expenditure on building services engineering
commissions and provisions against debtors and work in progress. The group
also took provisions of Pounds 700,000 for future property costs and Pounds
75,000 following revaluation of a freehold property.
Moves to reduce operational costs continued with redundancies amounting to
Pounds 358,000, against Pounds 603,000. Mr Henderson said the annualised
saving was Pounds 1.6m.
Although there were signs that the improvement in the UK economy was
stimulating new building investment initiatives - a number of new
commissions had been awarded throughout the group - Mr Henderson said that
trading conditions remained extremely difficult.
After a tax credit, losses per share emerged at 12.58p (earnings of 5.78p).
The omitted final dividend leaves a 0.5p payment for the year; the previous
year saw a total distribution of 4p.
The accounts were prepared on a going concern basis, dependent on an
anticipated agreement for continuing facilities with the group's bankers.

FT  23 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Bullough sharply lower after further
restructuring costs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BULLOUGH, the office products and refrigeration group, reported sharply
lower interim pre-tax profits after taking a Pounds 4.67m charge to cover
further restructuring in its French office furniture, Belgian industrial
heating and UK raised flooring businesses.
The restructuring costs, coupled with higher net interest payments of Pounds
921,000 (Pounds 418,000), reduced the group almost to break-even in the six
months to April 30 with pre-tax profits of just Pounds 50,000, compared to
Pounds 5.89m last time.
Turnover edged up to Pounds 133.4m (Pounds 132.7m), but would have been
slightly lower had it not been for currency influences.
Earnings per share fell to 0.02p (3.12p) but the interim dividend is
maintained at 1.75p and the group said that 'in the absence of unforeseen
circumstances' it intends to maintain the final of 4.3p.
Operating profits, before the restructuring costs, fell to Pounds 5.64m
(Pounds 6.31m) but Mr Robert Steel, managing director, said the year-on-year
figures masked a significant improvement in the office products business
over the 1992 second half when the group took a restructuring charge of
Pounds 3.32m.
Turnover in the core office products division slipped to Pounds 50m (Pounds
54.8m) but the division recorded a Pounds 83,000 operating profit compared
to a Pounds 2.3m loss in the 1992 second half, helped by improved profits
from the Project office furniture business in the UK.
Mr Steel said the latest restructuring charge, mostly to cover redundancy
costs, had been made necessary by the unexpected severity of recession in
the French office furniture equipment market and in Reznor's industrial
heater business based in Belgium.
More than half of the restructuring costs were attributable to Atal with the
balance split between Reznor and the Propaflor business in the UK.
Overall, the workforce was reduced by 400 to 4,600 during the first half,
and is expected to contract further although Mr Derrick Battle, chairman,
emphasised that the group does not expect any further restructuring charges.

FT  23 JUL 93 / UK Company News: British Syphon shares surge
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
British Syphon Industries, the industrial group, said yesterday that it was
to distribute a large part of its Pounds 33m cash reserves in a special
dividend amounting to 62.35p per share.
The shares responded via a 55p rise to 180p.
For the past two years the group's strategy had been to make a substantial
acquisition, a strategy that required the full support of Britannia, the
main shareholder.
However, in view of the difficulty in 'identifying' an appropriate
acquisition the board had decided to distribute a 'large' part of the cash
in the form of a special dividend.

FT  23 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Eliza Tinsley jumps 40%
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Eliza Tinsley, USM-quoted maker of hardware products, returned pre-tax
profits of Pounds 713,000 for the year ended March 31 1993, a 40 per cent
increase on last time's Pounds 510,000. The improvement maintained the
progress shown at the halfway stage.
Turnover declined from Pounds 15.7m to Pounds 15.1m. At the operating level
profits were lower at Pounds 867,000 (Pounds 917,000), squeezed by pressure
on margins, which was not offset by overheads reduced by Pounds 250,000, and
improved control systems.
The 1991-92 operating profit was before reorganisation costs of Pounds
249,000. The results were drawn up in accordance with FRS 3 accounting
standards.
The dividend is increased from 5.2p to 5.45p, with a final of 3.65p, paid
from earnings of 6.62p (4.72p).
The shares closed 10p lower at 97p.

FT  23 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Watts Blake shuns Sibelco offer - Defence
document says bid substantially undervalues company
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WATTS BLAKE Bearne, the world's biggest supplier of ball clay to the
ceramics industry, yesterday published its defence document recommending
shareholders to reject the Pounds 87m bid for the company from Sibelco.
The company said that the offer price of 420p a share substantially
undervalued the group, which was expected to increase pre-tax profits by
almost a fifth this year to not less than Pounds 8.6m (Pounds 7.25m).
The total dividend was forecast to rise in 1993 by 12 per cent to 12p.
Sibelco, a Belgian producer of silica sand for the glass industry,
effectively controls 45.2 per cent of the company's shares having agreed to
acquire the combined stakes of Ceramics Holdings, controlled by the Lebanese
Gargour family, and Quarzwerke, a privately-owned German silica sand
producer.
Sibelco previously was a member of a concert party with Ceramics Holdings
and Quarzwerke. This arrangement ended earlier this year when the Gargour
family decided to sell its Watts Blake shares.
Mr John Pike, managing director of Watts Blake, said yesterday that M&amp;G
Investment, its next largest shareholder with about a 7 per cent stake, had
decided that it would not accept the Sibelco offer.
'We believe other independent shareholders will follow M&amp;G's lead', said Mr
Pike.
Sibelco has said that it was a Stock Exchange requirement that it must make
a full offer for the company, following the purchase of the Ceramics and
Quarzwerke stakes, that had prompted the bid rather than a desire to take
over Watts Blake.
The Devon-based company which has been digging ball clay out of the Bovey
Basin near Newton Abbot since 1710, said that the offer price of 420p put
the group on a prospective exit p/e of 15.8 times, on forecast earnings of
26.5p for 1993.
This was considerably less than the sector averages for other companies
supplying industrial and building materials. It also allowed no premium for
a business which controlled 60 per cent of ball clay production in the UK,
25 per cent in Germany and between 25 and 30 per cent in the US.
The company supplied 40 per cent of ball clay used by European sanitaryware
manufactures and a third of the US sanitaryware market and was the
substantial supplier of ball clay to the Far East market. It also claimed to
supply a quarter of the European and US floor tile markets.
Mr Pike said that the company had increased profits in eight of the past 10
years and raised dividend payments every year except one, when they were
maintained.

Dollars 90m
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRICE Waterhouse, administrators of Maxwell Communication Corporation, has
sold Molecular Design, a California-based software company, for Dollars 90m
(Pounds 60m).
The deal is the first sizeable disposal of the US businesses owned by MCC.
MDL, which provides specialist software and support for the chemical and
pharmaceutical industries, was sold through a public offering and flotation.
Mr Alan Jamieson, the Price Waterhouse administrator, said there were bids
for MDL but because of the intangibles involved - intellectual property and
goodwill - the flotation raised more money.
All the MCC businesses in the US are in the process of being sold. Four
companies are in the final round of detailed due diligence and bidding for
Macmillan, the US publishing business which includes a 50 per cent interest
in the Macmillan/McGraw-Hill School Publishing Company joint venture.
Reed Elsevier is still favourite to buy Official Airlines Guide. The
Anglo-Dutch group has a non-binding, non-exclusive letter of intent. No
other higher offer has so far been received and Reed has obtained US
anti-trust clearance to acquire the business. The Collier Encyclopedia
publishing business is also being sold separately.
At the beginning of the disposal programme it was thought between Dollars
680m and Dollars 1.1bn would be raised.

FT  23 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Accounting changes flatter Hill &amp; Smith
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRE-TAX profits at Hill &amp; Smith Holdings, the steel stockholding, forging
and fabricated products group, improved from Pounds 1.24m to Pounds 1.48m in
the six months to end-March in spite of a small drop in sales.
The company's compliance with FRS 3 flattered profits by depressing the
comparative figure with a one-off exceptional charge of Pounds 212,000 for
losses on the May 1992 disposal of a stockholding subsidiary.
Loss-making Tipton Steel Stockholders (Stoke) was sold to Richardson
Westgarth and in March 1992 Hill &amp; Smith bought Duct &amp; Access Covers, a
manhole maker, which supplies the communications industry.
The transactions caused a net drop in turnover of about Pounds 500,000 and
sales dipped to Pounds 31.5m (Pounds 31.8m). Mr Michael Sara, group managing
director, said: 'We sold a loss-making company and bought one that makes
profits. That's why our profits have gone up.'
He added: 'The market for manhole covers is good in parts. Sales to BT have
been flat, to cable TV, fairly good and to construction, poor.' A slightly
firmer property market meant demand for building products, such as steel
lintels, was improving.
The company had experienced a 'very poor start' to its financial year: 'The
economy was diabolical in October and November, though from that period
things improved gradually until March. From March things have been a little
unsteady, but have levelled off to a point higher than in the autumn.'
The interim dividend is 2.1p, which taking into account the 1-for-15 scrip
issue in March, represents a 6.6 per cent increase. Earnings per share
improved to 3.34p (2.79p).

FT  23 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Campaigners put the boot in
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ANIMAL rights campaigners caused uproar at Boots' annual general meeting in
London yesterday.
They were complaining about the use of animals in testing the Manoplax heart
drug - withdrawn from circulation on Monday - and other products.
Sir Christopher Benson, chairman, struggled to control the meeting as
several shareholders who were animal rights supporters demanded to know how
much the company had spent on testing Manoplax on animals, and how many had
been involved.
One protester demanded that Boots withdraw from the pharmaceuticals business
in view of the suffering it caused to animals. Another demanded an apology
to the families of patients who had died prematurely as a result of taking
Manoplax.
Security guards had to be summoned at one point to keep order.
Sir James Blyth, chief executive, said that about 90 per cent of the Pounds
100m development cost of Manoplax had been spent on testing on humans, with
only a 'tiny proportion' spent on animal testing.

FT  23 JUL 93 / UK Company News: First Technology keeps up recovery momentum
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FIRST TECHNOLOGY, which supplies crash dummies and safety sensors to the car
industry, continued its rehabilitation by reporting a sharp increase in
profits and returning to the dividend list.
Mr Fred Westlake, executive chairman, said he would have liked to have paid
more than the 'stingy' 1p dividend announced, but had been constrained by
the terms of the capital reorganisation which was approved in February.
Pre-tax profits rose to Pounds 2.34m in the year to April 30, compared with
Pounds 639,000. However, under FRS 3, last year's figure becomes a loss of
Pounds 685,000 because of the inclusion of an extraordinary charge of Pounds
1.32m on the closure and disposal of businesses.
Group sales fell from Pounds 27.8m to Pounds 25.9m, although turnover from
continuing businesses increased by 22 per cent. Net borrowings fell from
Pounds 6m to Pounds 3.2m and gearing now stands at 51 per cent.
Having got out of vehicle design, Mr Westlake said he was happy to focus on
dummies and car sensors, which had strong growth prospects over the next
couple of years.
The automotive electronics division, which supplies sensors, increased sales
by 32 per cent in spite of difficult trading conditions in the group's
principal North American and European markets.
During the year it won contracts to supply fuel cut-off sensors to Fiat and
Honda.
Earnings per share were 10.75p, compared with 2.4p or a restated loss of
5.83p.
COMMENT
The figures were slightly ahead of expectations and should not impede the
steady recovery in the group's shares, which yesterday closed unchanged at
232p. The collapse in the share price from 500p in 1990 to 20p a mere 18
months later, has left a lot of scars, but the slimmed-down group now seems
both determined and obliged to proceed cautiously. It has strong market
positions, even if increasing legislation does heighten the competitive
threat from other sensor suppliers. Gearing should reduce further, although
the sharp fall last year mainly reflected tax benefits. Forecast profits of
about Pounds 3.7m put the shares on a prospective multiple of 14, a slight
discount to the market. That does not seem expensive, given the group's
confidence about orders, particularly from Japan and other parts of the Far
East, such as Korea.

FT  23 JUL 93 / UK Company News: TSB fails to agree terms over estate agency
chain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN ATTEMPT by TSB Group to establish a company with National &amp; Provincial
Building Society to buy and manage its chain of 133 estate agencies has
fallen through after the two organisations failed to agree a price for the
network.
TSB Group and National &amp; Provincial announced yesterday that 'differences of
opinion on the value of the businesses' had led to the heads of agreement
signed in April being terminated after negotiations revealed differences.
TSB is thought to have asked for about Pounds 10m for the estate agency
chain, which it hoped would eventually be sold to local managers as groups
of businesses. It said it did not think the price offered would have given
value to shareholders.
Mr Alastair Lyons, National &amp; Provincial's finance director, said the two
sides had been 'unable to come to a meeting of minds' as to the value of the
estate agents after the society had approach the bank with the proposal.
TSB said it intended to continue to manage the chain, which made a Pounds 6m
loss last year. The bank hopes that it would return to operating break-even
this year as the number of transactions in the housing market rises.
Mr Lyons said the society would press on with its strategy of trying to
acquire minority stakes in local chains of estate agents in order to be able
to sell products through them. It had hoped the TSB purchase would follow
this pattern.
TSB has been trying to sell businesses that it does not think contribute to
its core retail banking franchise.

FT  23 JUL 93 / UK Company News: William Hill subject of 'serious'
approaches
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRENT WALKER, the pubs, betting and property group, has had a number of
serious approaches for its William Hill subsidiary since it emerged that SG
Warburg had put together a Pounds 360m consortium bid for the betting shop
chain.
The approaches, which could involve taking an equity stake in William Hill
rather than a complete takeover, value the business at significantly more
than the consortium bid.
It is also understood that one of the equity investors lined up by Warburg
is unwilling to participate if the bid is regarded by Brent Walker as
hostile.
Brent Walker also announced that it had sold the Golden Horseshoe Casino in
London for Pounds 6.1m, of which Pounds 5.9m was paid into Brent Walker's
bank yesterday afternoon after the change of ownership was approved by
magistrates in the morning.
The buyer was City Clubs, a private casino operator.
Sir Keith Bright, chairman, is understood to be considering all
possibilities for William Hill, which is ring-fenced from Brent Walker and
has its own syndicate of banks owed a total of Pounds 350m.
That loan has to be refinanced by March 1 1994.
The options range from persuading the existing lenders to continue with the
debt to a flotation.
Some analysts estimate that a full flotation of William Hill could raise
Pounds 500m. However, they acknowledge that there would have to be a
discount on that if Brent Walker retained a large stake.
One analyst said a flotation would be a 'non-starter' if Brent Walker kept
more than 50 per cent.
Brent Walker is keen to retain an investment in William Hill so that any
rise in its value benefits Brent Walker's creditors.
Sir Keith is expected to tell shareholders at next week's annual meeting
that trading results from William Hill have improved, despite the Grand
National fiasco, with evening opening bringing a significant increase in
turnover.

FT  23 JUL 93 / UK Company News: TeleWest raises Pounds 190m to expand its
networks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TELEWEST, the UK's largest cable television operator with 3m homes under
franchise, has raised a Pounds 190m loan facility to build its networks.
The deal is believed to be the largest individual loan raised for the UK
cable industry and is a clear indication of the renewed interest in the UK
industry by the financial community.
TeleWest - a joint venture between TCI of Denver, the world's largest cable
operator, and US West, the American telephone company - will use the money
to press ahead building cable networks in south London and in the Bristol
and Bath area.
The company already provides a cable television service to nearly 160,000
customers and has 101,000 telephone lines in service.
Mr Ed Mattix, of TeleWest, said yesterday that cable was now very much a
combined television and telephone operation. 'The financial institutions are
very interested in the business (in the UK) and are as positive about its
future as we are,' he added.
The Toronto-Dominion Bank was the lead arranger of the eight and a half year
loan, which is fully underwritten. The co-arrangers were the Bank of Boston,
the Bank of Nova Scotia, Barclays, CIBC and SBC.
Another large financing - Pounds 160m for the Jones Cable Group - is
believed to be near completion put together by County NatWest.
Mr Richard Woollam, managing director of the Cable Television Association,
the industry trade body, said yesterday: 'I think people are starting to
wake up to what is going on in the cable industry.'
By the beginning of June there were 465,000 cable subscribers and 2.5m homes
were passed by cable networks giving a penetration rate, or ratio of
subscribers to those who could subscribe, of 21 per cent.

663,000
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
CAVERDALE Group, the motor retailing and industrial consumables group,
returned to profit in the first half of 1993 with all its companies making a
strong contribution.
Including a contribution from acquisitions of Pounds 7.86m, group turnover
increased to Pounds 21.6m against Pounds 4.77m, and operating profit came
out at Pounds 803,000, including acquisitions of Pounds 210,000, compared
with a loss of Pounds 170,000.
At the pre-tax level the profit was Pounds 663,000, compared with a loss of
Pounds 272,000 for the comparable period and a loss of Pounds 950,000 for
the whole of 1992.
Mr Arild Nerdrum, chairman, said Dunham &amp; Haines, acquired in September
1992, achieved a rapid recovery and was making a significant contribution to
group profit.
There was a strong first-time contribution from Motobaldet, a Citroen
dealer, and improved profitability in industrial consumables.
Mr Nerdrum said that the company would soon technically be in a position to
resume dividends.
'In view of the results achieved and given the current indications of good
trading prospects in August for our motor dealerships, I have every
confidence that an early return to the dividend list is realistic'.

<TEXT>
SHAREHOLDERS who took the cash alternative to Johnson Matthey's enhanced
scrip dividend scheme will receive 458.08p per share under a new type of
auction conducted by BZW Securities.
A total of 377,475 of the precious metals group's shares were auctioned to
institutions for a strike price of 459p, a 6p premium to the reference price
of 453p on which the scrip value was determined. BZW had previously promised
shareholders a 'floor' of 98 per cent of the reference price.
However, yesterday it also gave shareholders the benefit of 'best
execution', under which it passed on the benefit of any premium on the share
price over the floor. Shareholders thus received 101.32 per cent of the
reference price, minus BZW's commission.
BZW said the value of its cash offer was 10.77p per share, compared with the
enhanced scrip dividend of 10.65p and the ordinary of 7.1p.
Johnson Matthey's shares closed at 460p, up 7p.
Mr Michael Perry, BZW assistant director, said: 'It has been very positively
received. We had a comfortable volume of applications. It is a simple and
efficient process which benefited shareholders.'

FT  23 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Strong growth in Pru's single premium sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRUDENTIAL, the UK's largest life insurance company, reported strong growth
in single premium sales in the first six months of 1993 and a 5 per cent
reduction in income from annual premiums.
The figures provide further evidence of growing interest among savers in
life insurance products as interest rates fall, but consumers are still
reluctant to enter long-term regular financial commitments because of
concerns about job security.
Worldwide single premiums increased by 40 per cent to Pounds 2.89m, with
annual premium income down to Pounds 266m. Overall new business grew by 14
per cent (based on annual premiums plus 10 per cent of single premiums).
In the UK single premiums rose by more than a third to Pounds 1.42bn, mainly
as a result of the continued popularity of the with profits Prudence Bond
and strong sales of corporate pensions. Annual premiums fell by 11 per cent
to Pounds 153m following an expected decline in the sale of industrial
branch (or cash collection) policies. Ordinary branch business remained
unchanged at Pounds 143m.
Single premium for corporate pensions increased by 28 per cent to Pounds
309m while annual premiums rose by 24 per cent to Pounds 31m. Single premium
growth reflected strong sales of immediate annuities and transfers from
other group schemes.
Prudential's international operations produced strong results, with sales of
single premiums by Jackson National Life rising by 11 per cent to Dollars
1.1bn (Pounds 730m).

FT  23 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Lex forms joint venture to import Hyundai
cars
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS and PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LEX SERVICE, the UK's largest car distribution and leasing company, is
re-entering the car import business by acquiring a controlling interest in a
joint venture company which will be responsible for importing, distributing
and marketing Hyundai cars and parts in the UK.
Under the terms of the deal, Lex will acquire a 50.1 per cent stake in
Hyundai Car (UK), a new joint venture company with IM Group, which will have
an exclusive rolling three-year contract to import Hyundai cars from the
start of September.
IM Group, run by Mr Bob Edmiston, is the largest private motor import
business in the UK, and has held the Hyundai import franchise since 1982.
Last year, on a pro-forma basis, the Hyundai importership reported a Pounds
4m profit before interest and tax.
The joint venture will be funded by a cash payment of about Pounds 2m from
Lex to IM Group - roughly equal to the net assets of the business being
acquired - and bank loans of Pounds 7m to replace existing inter-company
loans.
IM Group and Lex will have put and call options respectively over IM Group's
share of the business, exercisable at the end of 1997 with a Pounds 22m
ceiling on the value of any payment.
The deal will re-establish Lex as a car importer following the decision of
Volvo, the Swedish car maker, to end its exclusive UK import agreement with
Lex last year, four years early.
Sir Trevor Chinn, Lex chairman, said yesterday, 'The acquisition of the
Hyundai importership is a significant step towards Lex's ambition of being
the leader in automotive distribution and leasing'.
Hyundai Motor, South Korea's largest single manufacturing entity with 40,000
employees, is undergoing turbulent times. It has been in the front line of
nearly two months of strikes over pay and conditions which have affected the
whole of the shipbuilding and aerospace conglomerate.
Despite these problems, widely regarded as short term, Hyundai has come to
be recognised by its motor industry rivals as potentially one of the more
dynamic emerging forces in world car markets.
It sold 110,000 cars in 13 European countries last year, making Europe its
biggest export market. The marque was first introduced in the UK in 1982,
when IM Group sold some 3,000 cars. Sales peaked in 1988 at 11,365, and held
at about 10,000 units last year despite a 30 per cent fall in the new car
market since 1989.

FT  23 JUL 93 / AT&amp;T shakes up its top management

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AMERICAN Telephone &amp; Telegraph, the US communications giant, yesterday shook
up its top management structure to position itself better for global
expansion and the convergence of the telecommunications, computer and media
industries.
The restructuring centres on the creation of a seven-member global
operations team, responsible for running AT&amp;T's businesses worldwide.
It will be chaired by Mr Victor Pelson, 56, who was the head of
telecommunications services. He will also become a member of the AT&amp;T board.
The team, which may be enlarged later, replaces a five-person operations
committee, chairmanship of which rotated among the heads of AT&amp;T's business
lines.
Mr Robert Allen, chairman, wants 50 per cent of AT&amp;T's revenues to come from
abroad by the end of the decade, compared with 25 per cent now. He said the
aim of the moves was to 'globalise the business more quickly and take
advantage of new market opportunities' from industrial convergence.
Mr William Marx, 54, who heads AT&amp;T Network Systems business, will take on
additional responsibilities for AT&amp;T's worldwide purchasing and global
manufacturing planning.
The restructuring gives new responsibilities to three executives regarded as
possibilities to succeed Mr Allen. They are Mr Alex Mandl, 49, chief
financial officer who moves to head communications services; Mr Robert
Kavner, 50, who will lead the multi-media products and services group; and
Mr Jerre Stead, 50, head of the group's NCR computer business.

FT  23 JUL 93 / Old loyalties tested by price war: Philip Morris's efforts
to lure US smokers back to Marlboro country
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON and NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Phrases such as 'Black Monday' or 'White Wednesday' are normally reserved
for cataclysmic events in the financial markets. But Philip Morris's
decision to slash the price of its top-selling Marlboro cigarette brand by
almost 20 per cent has been accorded similar status.
April 2, the day on which the price was cut was announced, has entered the
history books as 'Marlboro Friday'.
There is good reason for this. For years Marlboro has been one of the
world's top brands, commanding more than a fifth of the Dollars 46bn (Pounds
31bn) US cigarette market. The price cut both created mayhem in the highly
profitable US cigarette market and jolted the whole consumer products
sector, where all brands suddenly seemed vulnerable to cheaper own-label or
generic alternatives.
After all, if penny-pinching consumers were willing to substitute 'discount'
smokes for a well marketed brand such as Marlboro, triggering widespread
price cutting, would they not do likewise with less renowned names?
Three months on, the dust from Marlboro Friday shows little sign of
settling. Philip Morris announced this week that the Marlboro price cut  -
previously presented as a temporary, market-testing move - was being made
permanent and extended to the rest of its premium brands, including Virginia
Slims and Benson &amp; Hedges. Other manufacturers of premium brand cigarettes
will have to follow.
It also announced price changes in discount cigarettes, a market which was
virtually non-existent 10 years ago but now commands around 40 per cent of
total US cigarette sales.
Ironically, Philip Morris, a late entrant to the discount market, is now one
of the segment's leaders, with an estimated 33 per cent market share,
roughly the same as arch rival RJ Reynolds.
Philip Morris said it would be increasing the price of its cheapest brands
(so-called 'deep discounts') by around 6 cents a pack, and would formally
move its mid-range brands, which are already deeply discounted through trade
promotions, down to that level.
The result will be a two-tier price structure rather than a three-tier one
which, if it sticks, will be simpler for the consumer to understand and
cheaper for the company to administer.
The discount price increases are the latest in a series Philip Morris and RJ
Reynolds have pushed through since April, with the aim of narrowing the gap
between premium and cheap cigarettes to the point where consumer purchases
are guided more by perceptions of quality than by price. Marlboro, Philip
Morris reasons, will then regain ground, and its increased sales should help
offset the loss of profits from lower prices.
After the changes, the average retail price of a pack of discounted Philip
Morris cigarettes will be around Dollars 1.31 - roughly 45 cents lower than
a pack of Marlboro, selling for Dollars 1.70 to Dollars 1.80. Before April,
discount cigarettes could be a Dollars 1 or more cheaper than Marlboro's
Dollars 2.20 pack.
The new price structure is certainly helping Marlboro regain some lost
market share. Philip Morris produced figures this week from the independent
market research group Nielsen showing that an eight-month decline in the
brand's share of US cigarette sales, to 21.5 per cent in March, had been
sharply reversed. Its share rose to 22.6 per cent in May.
The company thinks that Marlboro's share may be up to around 24 per cent in
July - roughly what it was in May of last year - and that the price cuts are
adding 2 to 4 percentage points.
However, this does not mean all is hunky dory.
First, it seems that much of Marlboro's gain so far has come from other
premium brands, including Philip Morris's own. Mr Gary Black, an analyst at
Sanford C Bernstein, the US brokerage, reckons only about half of the
increase has come from discount brands, a figure which Philip Morris's
preliminary data seems broadly to support.
The corollary, says Mr Black, is that Marlboro is likely to lose around half
of its total market share gain since April, because consumers will revert to
other premium cigarettes as their prices are cut.
Second, it is far from certain that the 45 cents a pack price differential
between premium brands and discounts, which Philip Morris wants to impose on
the market, will stick.
Analysts suspect that smaller manufacturers of discount brands may cut
prices to maintain their share, creating a new, ultra-low price third tier.
At the very least, it is thought they will not follow Philip Morris's price
increases.
Little more than a month after Marlboro Friday, Liggett Group - a competitor
weakened by falling market shares and declining profits - launched a brand
called Eagle. This combines fairly attractive packaging and reasonable
quality with one of the lowest 'discount' prices.
Whatever the outcome, there can be little doubt that the profits of the US
industry will be depressed for the foreseeable future. With the US tobacco
market declining at a rate of around 2.5 per cent a year, the cuts seem
unlikely to push up demand.
Philip Morris reckons operating profits from its US tobacco business will be
about Dollars 3bn this year, a fall of more than 40 per cent. Second quarter
profits, announced this week, fell 53 per cent to Dollars 684m.
Mr Black forecasts that Philip Morris's US tobacco profits will dip by
Dollars 500m more next year to about Dollars 2.45bn, and that the US
industry as a whole could see 1994 profits down by Dollars 1bn.
This is before the uncertain effects of any decision by the Clinton
administration to raise federal excise taxes on tobacco products to pay for
its healthcare reform package, due out in the autumn.
The only consolation for Philip Morris is that its international tobacco
business is growing strongly - operating income was up 15 per cent to
Dollars 577m in the second quarter - as consumers in Third World countries
take up smoking.
Ironically, Marlboro remains a symbol of American affluence in developing
countries, just when financially strained US consumers have sent its owner
the message: 'We remain fairly loyal to your brand, but only if you keep
prices in line with the discount sector.' And that could still prove a
downward moving target.

FT  23 JUL 93 / Tiphook denies rumours of bidder
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TIPHOOK, the UK transport rental company, yesterday denied that it had been
approached by a potential bidder in an attempt to quash rumours in New York
and London.
Tiphook's shares closed 47p higher at 244p in London yesterday in response
to the speculation, which surfaced the previous day in the US. The group's
American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) rose Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 11 1/8 .
Mr Robert Montague, chairman, last night addressed a telephone conference of
500 US investors from London to dispel the rumours, which followed the
company's announcement of disappointing results last week.
US television quoted Mr Paul Ehrlichman, managing director of Brandywine
Asset Management, as saying he saw the possibility of a buy-out of Tiphook
over the next six to 12 months. Brandywine owns 1.1m ADRs - 3 per cent of
the equity. Possible suitors cited were other US leasing companies such as
GE Capital, GATX, Transmerica and XTRA. GATX denied it, none of the others
would comment.
Analysts in London were sceptical about the report, pointing out that
Tiphook's Pounds 1bn debt burden would deter most predators, and large
competitors would almost certainly be blocked on competition grounds.
Tiphook said yesterday that it was trading satisfactorily and confirmed that
it would pay the year-end dividend. It had no intention of giving any
price-sensitive information in the presentation to US investors, who now own
more than half the group's equity.
The company has the world's second largest fleet of containers - after
Genstar - and Europe's largest fleet of trailers, but its share price has
halved in less than two years.
The proportion of UK shareholders has fallen over that period from 60 per
cent to below 30 per cent.

FT  23 JUL 93 / Boots to sell French retailer for Pounds 41m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   LONDON, PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BOOTS, the retailing and pharmaceuticals group, agreed yesterday to sell its
French retail subsidiary Sephora for Pounds 40.9m, as it reported
encouraging trading figures and said it saw signs of recovery in the UK
retail sector.
Sir Christopher Benson, chairman, told an annual meeting disrupted by animal
rights protesters that group sales in the three months to June were up 7.7
per cent on last year. 'Some further recovery in the retail sector' was
expected during the year.
Sephora is being sold to French retailer Altamir for FFr360m (Pounds 40.9m),
made up of FFr178m for the shares and FFr182m to repay inter-company loans.
Sir James Blyth, chief executive, said Sephora made a profit last year in
spite of tough market conditions, but Boots' strategy demanded that all
businesses were capable of producing 'significant value' for shareholders.
'It is Boots' only retail interest outside the UK and will not meet our very
demanding performance criteria in the foreseeable future,' he said.
Sephora has made a substantial turnaround in the past few years, from an
operating loss of FFr60m in 1988 to a small profit of FFr0.27m last year.
With 38 shops, it is the market leader in a highly fragmented sector which
numbers 2,500 French cosmetics and perfume retailers.
Shareholders heard yesterday that all Boots' businesses except Do It All,
the DIY joint venture with W H Smith, enjoyed sales increases in the first
quarter. Sales were up 5.3 per cent at Boots the Chemists, 10.4 per cent at
Halfords, 15.8 per cent in Children's World, 8.6 per cent in Boots
Opticians, 3.2 per cent at A G Stanley, 11.1 per cent in Boots Healthcare
International, and 17.1 per cent in Contract Manufacturing. But sales at Do
It All were down 7.2 per cent in a 'severely depressed' market.
Sir Christopher reiterated the company's commitment to its pharmaceuticals
division - where sales were up 11.5 per cent - despite the withdrawal of the
Manoplax heart drug. The division was developing a 'strong and encouraging
new product pipeline', including an anti-obesity agent, schizophrenia
treatment and anti-diabetic agent.

FT  23 JUL 93 / Wellcome wins ruling on patents
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WELLCOME, the UK pharmaceuticals group, yesterday claimed victory in its
struggle for ownership of the patents for AZT, its treatment against the
Aids virus, HIV.
The drug, also called Retrovir, is the company's second best-selling
product, generating worldwide sales last year of Pounds 213m, representing
12.5 per cent of Wellcome's turnover.
Its share price rose 29p to close at 641p after the ruling by a federal
court in North Carolina.
Barr Laboratories, one of the two US generic companies challenging the
patents, contested Wellcome's claims to victory. Mr Edwin Cohen, Barr's
chairman, said his company would appeal to a federal appeals court in
Washington.
The other group contesting the patents is Novopharm.
Wellcome said the judge had decided the evidence was overwhelming and
conclusive that inventors at Burroughs Wellcome, its US subsidiary, had
first conceived of the idea of using AZT as a therapy for treating persons
infected with HIV. The company added that the judge had decided there was no
evidence for the jury to find against Wellcome.
Mr Paul Holcombe, vice-president and general counsel at Burroughs Wellcome,
said: 'I call that sort of conclusion a clear-cut victory. It is a victory
not just for Wellcome, but also the whole research-based industry as well.'
Mr Cohen, however, said the judge had been unable to decide a definition of
the term 'conception of the inventive process', which was vital to the case.
If the appeal court agreed with Barr's definition, Barr would ask for the
case to be heard before a new jury.
Mr Holcombe said the judge had agreed with Wellcome's definition.
Meanwhile, Wellcome announced that Sir Alistair Frame, its chairman, would
retire for reasons of ill-health. In April, Sir Alistair announced he would
step down as chairman of British Steel on the advice of his doctor.
Mr Roger Gibbs, chairman of Wellcome Trust, which last year sold its
majority stake in Wellcome, said: 'We are most sad that Sir Alistair's
health will not allow him to continue. We are grateful to him for the
outstanding contribution he has made over the past three years, and will
miss his wisdom and experience.'
The group's chief executive, Mr John Robb, will take over as interim
chairman. The company insisted the move would be temporary until a
replacement could be found.

FT  23 JUL 93 / Church of England managers censured for losses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Church of England's investment managers came under serious criticism
yesterday for policies which led to the loss of more than Pounds 800m in the
value of their assets over three years.
A report by accountants Coopers &amp; Lybrand says a decision by the Church
Commissioners to speculate heavily in property, particularly in large retail
schemes, left them exposed in a sector with a 'high inherent level of risk'.
The property market slump was largely responsible for a fall in the capital
value of assets from nearly Pounds 3bn in 1989 to Pounds 2.16bn last year.
Property represented 60 per cent of total assets in 1990.
The dent in the church's finances will force parishes to meet a far greater
share of its running costs and provoke early changes to a non-contributory
pension scheme for clergy.
Yesterday's report was commissioned by Dr George Carey, archbishop of
Canterbury. Criticism of the commissioners responsible for the Church of
England's main investments followed an investigation by the Financial Times.
The Coopers &amp; Lybrand report also criticises the handling of asset
management. Several large property developments, it says, had been adversely
affected by 'poor project control procedures, disregard for external
professional advice and inadequate internal reporting structures'.
The fall in income will have severe implications for the Church of England.
An accom-panying report published by the Lambeth Group, a committee set up
under the chairmanship of the Rt Rev John Wayne, bishop of Chelmsford, to
consider the Coopers &amp; Lybrand recommendations, says the level of
contribution by the commissioners to the cost of pensions, stipends and
housing 'cannot be maintained'.

FT  23 JUL 93 / Nationwide board seat for redundant regional manager
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A REGIONAL manager of Nationwide Building Society who lost his job last year
was yesterday elected to its board against the wishes of the society's
chairman.
Mr David English, made redundant as northern region sales director a year
ago, beat Sir Leonard Peach, IBM's former UK personnel director and chairman
of the Police Complaints Authority, in a postal ballot of 3.5m investors.
Mr English, who managed 150 branches in the north of England, was one of
three former employees who stood for election. The society made 650 staff
redundant last year in an attempt to cut costs. He lost his job when the
society abolished two of its four regions after working for Nationwide for
25 years.
Mr English told members that he understood the occasional frustration of
customers and would work to ensure the society was beyond reproach.
Mr Brian Davis, operations director, Mr Alistair Dales, finance director,
and Mr David Beety, another non-executive director, were re-elected. Savers
holding more than Pounds 100 in investment accounts were eligible to vote.
Although 3.5m of Nationwide's 7m savers received ballot papers, only 103,000
were returned. Mr English received 53,361 votes, while Sir Leonard received
only 42,779 votes.
Mr Tim Melville-Ross, chief executive, said there had been less controversy
than at past meetings. He said Mr English's election would not cause
problems and he expected that he would contribute knowledgeably to
discussions. However, Mr Melville-Ross said Mr English's election raised
serious issues. Nationwide had a legal duty under the 1986 Building
Societies Act to ensure it had a balanced board that was capable of
reviewing strategy.
He said the society was now likely to consider incentives to its members to
vote, such as offering those who returned ballot papers the chance to win
lottery prizes.
Members voted after receiving election addresses from all the candidates and
a recommendation from the chairman, Sir Colin Corness, to re-elect the four
existing directors in the ballot.

FT  23 JUL 93 / Life insurance agents to reveal commissions: Treasury orders
change in rules of disclosure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LIFE INSURANCE sales agents will have to give customers more information
about policies, including how much cash commission they receive on each one.
The Treasury yesterday ordered securities regulators to draft rules
requiring agents to disclose more about their products.
The life insurance industry has fiercely resisted disclosure of commissions.
The Office of Fair Trading first urged full disclosure in 1987 when it
ordered the abandonment of an industry agreement setting a limit on
commissions paid to agents.
The Treasury's pronouncement followed its review of an OFT report which
concluded that proposals on disclosure from the Securities and Investments
Board, supported by the life insurance industry, gave consumers too little
information to choose products wisely. The Treasury yesterday gave the SIB
until the end of the year to rewrite its rules to conform to the OFT report.
In addition to disclosing commissions, companies will have to tell
prospective customers by how much their charges are likely to reduce
investment returns, how early surrender would affect the value of a policy
and allow low-cost sales outlets to charge less for the same product than
high-cost outlets.
The Treasury went beyond the recommendations of the OFT in the area of
commission disclosure and ordered the SIB to propose ways in which all sales
agents, including those based at banks and building societies, could
accurately portray to prospective customers their commission on each sale.
The OFT had urged that only independent financial advisers, who sell the
products of many companies, should disclose commission.
Mr Anthony Nelson, economics secretary to the Treasury, said the government
was concerned by the high lapsing rate of life insurance and pensions
policies, causing serious losses for investors.
He said an estimated Pounds 250m in premiums was lost each year on charges
incurred on lapsed policies and that a third of all policies lapsed in the
first two years when the investor was unlikely to receive any significant
refund of premiums paid.
Also, data submitted to the Treasury showed that as few as one-eighth of all
policies were held until maturity. 'I am very concerned about the
obligations and liabilities that people are getting themselves into,' Mr
Nelson said.
The ruling was welcomed by the Consumers' Association, which has campaigned
for greater transparency in the sale of life insurance and pension products.

FT  23 JUL 93 / The Lex Column: Tiphook
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Trying to put a fair value on Tiphook's shares is one of the market's more
esoteric diversions. Following its poor annual results, British investors
have shunned the shares, driving the price down to a point where they yield
more than 12 per cent. The London market harbours an innate suspicion of
companies which support Pounds 1bn of debt on shareholders' funds only
one-fifth that level and have an unhappy history of haemorrhaging cash.
Yet tastes clearly differ in the US where Tiphook has developed something of
a fan club. The televised ruminations of a US fund manager  - and
substantial shareholder - about a possible bid sparked a surge of interest
in Tiphook's ADRs. Tiphook's denial that it was in any takeover talks failed
to damp investors' ardour. Its shares closed 24 per cent higher yesterday.
Of course, Tiphook could become a bid target; GE Capital recently bought its
rival TIP Europe. Nevertheless, the hope seems a tenuous thread by which to
suspend such a heavy weight of financial worries. Tiphook must be fervently
praying that last night's telephone conference with 500 US investors does
not have the same effect on its share price as its recent talks with UK
analysts.

FT  23 JUL 93 / The Lex Column: Volkswagen
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Given the welter of publicity surrounding the industrial espionage row
between Volkswagen and GM, it is surprising that the former's shares have
fallen less than 7 per cent since their 1993 peak earlier this month. The
reason may be that, as with the clash between British Airways and Virgin in
the UK, the implications for the company are less than meets the eye. Mr
Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua has acquired a legendary reputation in the
motor industry, but GM's share price quickly recovered from the shock of his
defection in March. It is far from clear whether his tenure at VW will be
unnaturally short, but the effect may be equally transitory if the worst
does come to the worst.
VW's labour-shedding programme was in place before Mr Lopez arrived with a
brief to cut component costs. His appointment was a final admission on VW's
part that radical action was needed. Mr Lopez has not been there long, but
he will have had sufficient time to indicate to his new employers how much
saving to expect and how it can be achieved. It matters less who now
actually implements a programme similar to that already carried out by other
large motor companies.
The greater risk to VW is that, in promising to return to the black next
year, it may have underestimated the downturn in the European car market. If
it is protracted, producers may have to contend with price falls as well as
lower volumes. That would cancel out some of the cost savings VW is now
starting to generate.

<TEXT>
All credit to the chancellor for trying to remove the cloak of obfuscation
behind which the life insurance industry shelters. Up-front disclosure of
commissions for both independent advisers and tied salesmen makes perfect
sense, although the Securities and Investments Board is left with the tricky
task of putting the idea into practice. Unravelling pricing structures in
bancassurance, for example, will not be easy. Disclosure of life companies'
charges may squeeze the least efficient offices. If that forces
consolidation on an over-populated industry, so much the better.
How consumers will react when confronted with the full cost of life
insurance remains an open question. Personal equity plans and tax-exempt
bank accounts have already increased competition for long-term savings. New
business figures from the Prudential show that savers are wary of committing
themselves to traditional regular premium contracts. Recession may be partly
to blame, but the outlook for the housing market - and therefore sales of
endowment mortgages - is anything but bright. Unless the government takes
some uncharacteristically brave decisions, the pensions revolution of the
1980s has also run its course. Life companies will have to fight for
business from here on. Greater transparency may not help their cause.
On that basis the long bull run in life insurance shares may be running out
of steam. After the latest rally even fat laid down in the form of
undistributed investment surpluses is fully in the price. If disclosure
contributes to consolidation there will be rationalisation benefits to come,
but these will be spread unevenly through the sector. Picking winners will
be more important for investors as well as savers.

There was a sickly look not just to the French franc but to the entire ERM
last night as the realisation sank in that strong money growth would make
the Bundesbank reluctant to cut rates. There is little chance of the system
surviving in its current form if the franc is forced out. That would only
underline how wasteful in terms of lost output, jobs and fiscal revenues has
been the attempt to keep up with Germany. Both countries must hope they can
ride out the storm. Yet intervention on yesterday's scale cannot be
maintained indefinitely; nor will the markets be convinced for long by
higher French money market rates, given its manifest desire to block any
impact on the real economy.
A full point cut in German rates could now be needed to calm the markets
down, but that would be a miraculous change of heart for the Bundesbank.
Technical alternatives - like a narrowing of the franc's trading bands to
show determination or a widening to give additional leeway - do not promise
much. Neither would allow France to cut rates significantly below German
levels, which is what its economy needs.
Perhaps the Balladur administration should take heart from the UK's
experience. Its exit from the ERM allowed rates to be cut and recovery to
begin while inflation continued to fall. Against other ERM countries the
D-Mark is strong. Against sterling, the Swiss franc and the yen it is weak.
Were the French franc to leave the ERM its natural strength might show
through. France's determination to cling to the system even at severe cost
is the largest factor forcing it down.

THE Church of England's investment managers came under serious criticism
yesterday for policies which led to the loss of more than Pounds 800m in the

The slump in the property market was largely responsible for a fall in the

The dent in the church's finances will force parishes to meet a far greater

The fall in income will have severe implications for the Church of England.
An accom-panying report published by the Lambeth Group, a committee set up
under the chairmanship of the Rt Rev John Wayne, bishop of Chelmsford, to
consider the Coopers &amp; Lybrand recommendations, says the contribution by the
commissioners to the cost of pensions, stipends and housing 'cannot be
maintained' at present levels.
Sir Michael Colman, chairman of Reckitt &amp; Colman, appointed first church
estates commissioner after the events under investigation, said that the
commissioners 'had something to apologise for'. He agreed with
recommendations for greater accountability and, as incoming head of the
commission, would have wanted to implement such changes regardless of the
problems.
The Coopers &amp; Lybrand report says, measuring the commissioners' performance
in terms of total yield, that 'the fund as a whole has performed
significantly worse than the market average'.
In the last five years total yield had failed to match inflation. Average
annual real terms yield during the ten years to December, 1991, was 6.2 per
cent, compared with a market average for large funds of 9.7 per cent. Over
the last five years the comparison was 'even less favourable'.

<TEXT>
IT IS A measure of the lobbying power of Britain's life assurance industry
that it has taken so long to root out its opaque and anti-competitive sales
practices. Yesterday's intervention by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor,
looks like being the decisive blow in a battle that has lasted well over
five years.
The charge against the industry is twofold. First, many investors are sold
policies unsuitable to their circumstances, with around a third surrendering
policies in the first two years. This stems largely from the industry's
refusal to disclose clearly commissions paid, what each product costs and
the penalties for the early surrender of policies. So long as investors are
confused about the nature of what they are buying, they will not be in a
position to choose wisely.
Second, a large proportion of investors' premiums are swallowed up in high
charges, which reflect the lack of competitive pressure to cut costs.
Practices such as the use of standard industry charges to project investment
returns rather than individual companies' charges are to blame. So is the
lack of transparency. Competition can only flourish when investors have
enough information to shop around.
Reform is important not only because of the central role that life products
play in existing savings habits. More than two-thirds of British households
have at least one life policy, often linked to their pensions or mortgages.
Change is also necessary if the government is to press ahead with ideas to
encourage people to rely less on the welfare state and more on personal
saving for old age, sickness and unemployment. There would, for example, be
little point in privatising the state pension if people's savings were
frittered away by high charges.
The particular reforms mandated by Mr Clarke closely mirror recommendations
from the Office of Fair Trading earlier this year. Life companies will have
to give details of intended surrender values; tied agents and independent
advisers will have to reveal their commissions; agents for the same company
will be able to compete on price; and companies will be required to use
their own charges in providing illustrations of projected returns.
The overall effect will be more informed choice by savers and more vigorous
competition between providers.
The life industry will not like reform that disrupts the cosy world they
have lived in for so long. It is even possible that it will put pressure on
the Securities and Investments Board, the investment regulator which has
responsibility to implement Mr Clarke's orders, to dilute the reforms'
impact.
Foot-dragging, though, would be extremely unwise as it would only serve to
damage further the industry's image. Life companies should realise that the
game is up and that it is time to clean up their act.

The wisdom of public servants' hallowed principle - 'give 'em an inch and

Meteorological Office's inquiries service, opened in response to John
Major's Citizen's Charter.
From 400 calls in its first month, it's now up to 1,000-plus. Nor are all of
them easily answered, as witness the farmer's complaint about the office's
advance warnings of frosts weather-watchers can foresee. 'I can get most of
these from the evening TV forecasts,' he snapped. 'What I really want is a

If John Major reckons it has been a tough week, he might like to ponder the
fortunes of the opposition Indonesian Democratic party (PDI) at its annual
conference in Sumatra.
The PDI won just 15 per cent of the vote in last year's general election and
it appears that the government, in power for over 20 years, is getting a
little bored with easy domination. Hence, it was the founder of the ruling
Golkar party, President Suharto himself, who opened the conference, calling
on the PDI to get its act together.
As if his presence were not enough, he was followed by the home affairs
minister and the chief of the armed forces entreating their opponents to
unite.
No sooner had they left than 50 rebel PDI members tried the other approach.
Storming the venue in a pick-up truck, they knocked down the entrance gates,
and seized the floor shouting 'Kill Surjadi', the PDI chairman. 'This is our
congress, so please sit down,' the rebels' leader bellowed.
Order was re-established just in time for the minister of defence to give
his speech.

This year's New York Fed Christmas party should be distinctly enlivened by
the presence of the new governor, Bill McDonough.
Despite his quiet demeanour, McDonough is something of an entertainer in his
way, it transpires. In his First Chicago days he was an active member of the
British-North American Committee, the group of 130 private sector leaders
from the US, Canada and Britain, whose current membership includes the likes
of Sir David Plastow, Ronnie Hampel and John Heimann, and from which, now
being a public servant, McDonough has since stepped down.
Four years ago, the December meeting marking the committee's 20th
anniversary was held in Montreal where the hosts put on a traditional Beaver
Club dinner, complete with live bear and hunter on horseback. The high spot
of the evening, however, was McDonough, whom a friend describes as 'very
Irish really', taking to the floor with the then chairman of the Rank
Organisation, the late Sir Patrick Meaney, to regale the audience with a
medley of songs from the Emerald Isle.

In accordance with what might be termed Vorsprung Murk Technik, the Germans
are customarily kept in the dark about road accidents in their country. But
the bonnet has now been lifted by a certain Professor Klaus Engels of
Cologne with a study of 102,683 shunts during 1991, which was published in
Focus magazine, a new German weekly.
Alas his work - showing that the toll included 10,643 deaths, 515,960
injuries, and DM17.2bn in insurance pay-outs - is not uniformly considered
useful by the motor manufacturers, at least. Take for instance the sceptical
response Focus quotes from Volkswagen spokesman Dietmar Fritsche: 'What
would the public do with the data?' he asked.
Only adding to VW's woes this summer, it emerges that while the German
company does head at least one of the safety leagues compiled for the US -
where its advertising features road accident statistics alongside a family
with the slogan 'Keep your valuables in a safe place' - none of its models
appears in Engels's top 10 in its home market. They are led by two Nissans
followed by a Peugeot, a Volvo, a Ford Granada, two Mercedes, a Citroen, a
BMW, and a Mercedes again. The best ranked VW, its Santana, comes 13th.

FT  23 JUL 93 / Observer: Dagger and cloak
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Given the inevitable suspicion that MI5's vow to be more open is a
smokescreen, it's reassuring to see some unequivocally cloak and dagger work
in process on the fringes of security operations: in the London-based
International Institute of Strategic Studies.
Why did its Swedish director Bo Huldt leave after only a year? Because his
wife couldn't find a job in London, the institute's council was told this
spring by its chairman, Robert Ellsworth, once President Nixon's
under-secretary for defence.
Really? Well . . . not quite.
It seems that Huldt, who's going back to heading Sweden's institute of
international affairs, was given his marching orders by Ellsworth,
apparently in response not only to complaints from staff, but to a drastic
decline in support from US foundations.
The revelation has nevertheless scarcely pleased the council members, drawn
from the great and the good of the western defence establishment. Hence,
perhaps, their shilly-shallying over Ellsworth's attempts to have Huldt
replaced by the institute's director of studies, John Chipman, a Canadian
who has applied for British nationality.
Thanks to a special council meeting, he is now faced by an external
contender, with the choice to be announced at the institute's September
conference in Brussels.
Whichever of the two ends up getting the dagger, the outsider's identity is
under the cloak. But there's one thing that is known. Since the candidate is
definitely a he, it is not Stella Rimington.

FT  23 JUL 93 / Leading Article: Life or death for Mr Major
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
EIGHTEEN MONTHS after his self-styled triumph in negotiating a modified
Maastricht treaty and at the end of the most arduous parliamentary ordeal
endured by any post-war prime minister, Mr John Major has made his final
gamble.
If he cannot win today's confidence motion, he will cast his party into
almost certain defeat in a general election. He is thus inviting his rebel
backbenchers to choose to face the voters at a time when the Conservative
Party is running third in the opinion polls, with a paltry 24 per cent share
of the electorate's support. The party must decide whether it prefers office
or infighting.
Given yesterday's votes in the House of Commons, the prime minister had
little option but to pursue this course. With a handful of his own
backbenchers prepared to humiliate him all the way to the finishing line,
only a confidence motion and the threat of electoral self-destruction offers
the prospect of even a sullen party unity in the house today.
Such is the bitterness within the Conservative Party on this issue that it
cannot be stated with certainty that Mr Major will win today's vote. If he
does not, British politics will enter a maelstrom in which every aspect of
Britain's relationship with the European community will be called into
question.
It is more likely, however, that Mr Major will win, having paid the price of
yet another unseemly deal with the Ulster Unionists, and with a legacy of
rancour inside his party which will not be easily sweetened. Many think that
the prime minister will be so weakened by his Maastricht wounds that he will
be flung aside this year, exhausted, to make way for a new leader.
This is not necessarily so. The economy continues to strengthen. Turbulence
within the ERM threatens to inflict upon others bruises as painful as those
Britain suffered last September. And above all, Mr Major's opponents outside
his own party still fail to impress. Yesterday's debate saw the Liberal
Democrats still pirouetting on the Euro-ice, facing different directions at
bewildering speed. Meanwhile Labour, tactically triumphant in the first tied
vote last night and victorious in the second, is enjoying only the hollowest
of victories. The credibility of Mr John Smith, a career Euro-enthusiast,
has been more severely damaged by Maastricht than even that of his weary
opponent on the other side of the despatch box.
The process of taking the Maastricht treaty through the British political
process has damaged all the parties and brought discredit and confusion to
the parliamentary process itself. But the fact remains that there is a
majority in the House of Commons in favour of this treaty and that it is in
Britain's interest to be inside, not outside post-Maastricht Europe. Mr
Major deserves to win today.

Members of the computer industry and press, waiting in the lobby at 600
Pennsylvania Avenue, Washington, for the Federal Trade Commission's
anti-trust decision on Microsoft, were told at about 2pm on Wednesday the
agency would not comment on the stalemate it had reached.
Privately, however, FTC observers said politics had played a role. The group
reached a two-to-two deadlock, with commissioners Janet Steiger and Dennis
Yao voting for an administrative action (seeking changes in business
practice) against Microsoft, and commissioners Deborah Owen and Mary
Aczcuenaga voting against. The group then argued about closing the case.
Owen is a conservative Republican appointed by former President George Bush
in 1989. Aczcuenaga, an independent, has been noticeably hesitant in the
past about intervention in cases of alleged monopoly. Steiger is a liberal
Republican, and Yao is a Democrat.
The complaint voted on by the commissioners involved two main points:
Microsoft's practice of creating the appearance of incompatibilities between
its own and rival products, and its 'per processor' licensing scheme (see
above). The latter was restored to the complaint at the last minute, after
argument by attorneys for Novell, Microsoft's largest competitor in the PC
softare market. Novell had protested that the licensing issue - which it saw
as having an enormous impact on competition - had been thrown out of the
case owing to an objection by one of the commissioners.
FTC insiders said that, despite Owen's insistence that the case be closed,
the other commissioners chose to keep it open. The commission has thus
allowed for the possibility that it or the justice department could
eventually try the case.
The FTC is considering three scenarios. First, the justice department could
ask to take on the case. Ann Bingaman, President Bill Clinton's new
anti-trust chief at the justice department, has acknowledged she is
interested in reviewing it.
Second, commissioner Owen, said to have been looking for another job
recently, might take up a position outside the agency. Clinton could then
name another commissioner, who might break the deadlock.
Third, FTC insiders said commissioner Roscoe Starek, who withdrew himself
from the case, had made inquiries about rejoining it. Having a fifth
commissioner involved could break the deadlock.
Observers of the three-year FTC inquiry into Microsoft's practices said the
best outcome for the FTC would be to finish the case itself, as it would be
an embarrassment if the justice department were to have to finish work it
had started.
'It is unlikely the case will remain open for very long, unless the
department of justice asks for documents, or a change occurs at the FTC,'
said a source close to the agency. If the FTC received a request to take
over the case, Janet Steiger, FTC chairman, would decide whether to grant
it.
Microsoft, which discovered the possible involvement of the justice
department about a week ago, is expected to begin lobbying officials. Late
last week, Bill Gates, chairman of Microsoft, and a team of Microsoft
attorneys, met separately with each commissioner, and with FTC staff serving
on two of its investigative arms, its Bureau of Competition and Bureau of
Economics.
If the case moves to the justice department, Microsoft is expected to hear
soon whether the department will proceed against it.
Within the FTC there is a body of opinion that the justice department may
take the case within a month. It could request that some of the FTC lawyers
on the case be 'deputised' to it. A formal request for documents would need
to be issued, according to rules on transferring documents from one agency
to another 'for law-enforcement purposes'.
In the UK, the Office of Fair Trading continues its own six-month-old
investigation of Microsoft. The FTC is expected to provide the OFT with
copies of its subpoenas and requests for evidence from Microsoft. Observers
in the US said that software companies Novell, Borland and WordPerfect have
all been providing information on Microsoft's alleged anti-competitive
practices, both to the OFT and the European Commission.
The author is writing a book on the FTC and Microsoft to be published early
next year

FT  23 JUL 93 / A case that doesn't compute: The implications of a stalled
anti-trust ruling on software groups
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The US Federal Trade Commission's inability to come to a decision on whether
to pursue anti-trust complaints against Microsoft, the world's largest
software company, has fuelled a long-simmering debate in the computer
industry.
Is Microsoft's domination of the software field a model for US international
competitiveness, or has it inhibited the ability of rival US companies to
compete on a 'level playing field'? Not since the early days of the
US-Japanese chip trade wars a decade ago, have feelings run so high on the
issue of allegedly unfair business practices.
The FTC's failure on Wednesday to reach a conclusion on whether to take
action against Microsoft did not close its three-year anti-trust
investigation. But it has dampened the hopes of competitors that Microsoft
will be forced to change its alleged unfair business practices.
'We are very disappointed,' said Mr David Bradford, senior vice-president
and general counsel of Novell, Microsoft's largest competitor in the PC
market and its most outspoken critic. 'It is unbelievable that the FTC will
not act on this case.' Microsoft's business practices are reducing
competitors' sales, forcing job cuts and discouraging investment in the
software industry, he and other critics charge.
Not everyone in the computer industry sees Microsoft as a bully that has
carved out market share at the expense of less aggressive, smaller rivals.
Some observers believe Microsoft has helped to create business opportunities
for a host of smaller software and computer companies in an expanding
market, but that these have been bruised in their attempts to compete
directly with the software superpower.
'Microsoft is a very good, smart company that does a good job and Americans
should be proud that it exists. It really has fostered development,' said a
senior software industry executive. 'There are too many would-be
multi-billionaires in the industry who prefer to criticise Bill Gates's
Microsoft than to examine their own shortcomings.'
The FTC decided to probe the software industry in June 1990, apparently
prompted by extensive reports about Microsoft's dominance in the personal
computer operating system market. Microsoft is the leading supplier of
software for PCs. Its MS-Dos program - which controls the basic functions of
a computer - is used on an estimated 95 per cent of all standard PCs
(excluding the Apple Macintosh). This has given the company a virtual
monopoly in the industry that, some charge, it has abused.
Mr Bradford claims Microsoft has constrained competition in the market for
PC operating systems through its use of 'per-processor' licensing policies.
Microsoft offers discounts to computer manufacturers which agree to pay
licence fees for the use of MS-Dos calculated on the total number of PCs
they sell, rather than the number of copies of the program they make. In
effect, this prevents PC makers from offering their customers alternative
operating systems such as Novell's DR-Dos, Novell claims. If a customer
chose DR-Dos, for example, the PC maker would still have to pay Microsoft's
MS-Dos licensing fee because of the 'per processor' licensing agreement.
Microsoft has also been accused of 'technological tying', by allegedly
introducing features into some of its programs that link their use to other
Microsoft products. A further charge is that the company gives its own
applications program developers - who develop word processors, spreadsheets
or games - information about operating system program changes before it
informs competitors, thereby putting the latter at a disadvantage.
Yet some observers argue that, by establishing an industry standard with
MS-Dos that enables PCs from hundreds of different manufacturers to 'play'
the same applications programs, Microsoft has contributed significantly to
the proliferation of PCs over the past decade, creating a Dollars 50bn
worldwide industry dominated by US hardware and software manufacturers. If
the US justice department decides to pursue the anti-trust action and
succeeds in restraining Microsoft, this could damage the entire software
industry.
'We are not asking the FTC to break Microsoft apart,' Mr Bradford insists.
'What we want is to enable customers to walk into a computer store and have
the freedom to choose among a broad choice of operating systems programs, or
network operating system programs or applications programs. The customer
would benefit from increased competition.'
Novell, which is leading the crusade to persuade the justice department to
step in, would benefit if Microsoft were forced to modify its business
practices. However, dozens of other software and computer companies,
including Borland International, WordPerfect and Lotus Development, have
provided the FTC with information about Microsoft's alleged violations of
anti-trust laws and would stand to gain equally. Steve Jobs, founder of
Apple Computer and now chairman of Next Computer, has publicly called for
the break-up of Microsoft into two companies, one for operating systems, the
other for applications programs. He charges that Microsoft's monopoly
restricts innovation in the PC industry.
As the FTC conducted its investigations, it found that Microsoft's
competitors were keen to share their stories of the industry leader's
tactics.
'I've met with the FTC about 10 times and it is very clear to me that the
FTC staff has concluded that Microsoft's practices are not only unlawful but
incredibly harmful to the US industry,' says a senior executive at another
large PC software company.
Yet on two occasions - first in February and then on Wednesday - FTC staff
recommendations for anti-trust action against Microsoft have failed to win a
majority vote from the four commissioners considering the case (see below).
Two of the commissioners have not been convinced. 'They have been persuaded
by Microsoft they are simply hearing whining and complaints from companies
that envy Microsoft's success or are not as clever or competitive,' another
software industry executive says.
Microsoft remains stubborn. While consistently denying any wrongdoing and
co-operating fully with the FTC investigation, executives reject any
suggestion the company might need to modify its practices to avoid even the
appearance of anti-trust violations. The company says it does not want to be
constrained by having to 'second-guess what a government agency might think'
about business decisions.
'The considerations are: is it in our business interests, is it in the
customers' business interests, is it legal and moral? And if it is, then we
go ahead and do it. In the long term, the FTC and all the enforcers will
recognise that that is the way business decisions ought to be made,' Mr Mike
Maples, Microsoft executive vice-president, has said.
Yet Microsoft cannot be complacent. The FTC has the power, if it decides to
use it, to change the shape of the US software industry, loosening
Microsoft's hold on the market and launching a free-for-all whose outcome is
unclear. While a fragmented industry might benefit some players, it could
have a detrimental effect by confusing customers and thus slowing PC sales.
With the FTC anti-trust case stalled, Microsoft's critics are considering
other options, such as bringing a private anti-trust action. That could tie
up Microsoft's resources for years and divert its energies.
Maybe conciliation would be a more advantageous response. Microsoft might
care to look at the example of Intel, the world's largest semiconductor chip
maker. It was also the target of competitors' allegations of anti-trust
violations, but was exonerated by the FTC after it instituted a company-wide
training programme to make its employees aware of anti-trust laws.
Perhaps there is a lesson there for Microsoft, although its competitors
might wonder whether it is the right one.

FT  23 JUL 93 / Leading Article: German dilemma
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE HUM of speculative activity across Europe's foreign exchange markets
has, since Wednesday, reached an anxious pitch. Higher-than-expected German
monetary growth in June now looks likely to prevent the Bundesbank from
delivering further cuts in short-term interest rates soon. But without the
prospect of a substantial cut in German rates, the chances of maintaining
current parities in the exchange rate mechanism look increasingly slim. A
speedy, and orderly, realignment would still be desirable; a further, and
bloody, crisis may be approaching.
The Bundesbank now looks boxed in. While presumably keen to avoid the blame
for the ERM's demise, the bank's council members are even more desperate not
to save it at the expense of their underlying objective: to secure
medium-term price stability. A rate cut now, in a week in which broad money
growth climbed to an annualised and seasonally adjusted rate of 7.1 per
cent, outside the bank's own target range for the year of 4.5-6.5 per cent,
would certainly look bad. It would look especially bad if, as expected,
consumer price inflation has risen to 4.3 per cent in July, more than twice
the Bundesbank's long-term 2 per cent target.
Surely, Germany's European partners cry, inflation cannot still be Germany's
main problem: the inverted shape of its yield curve, high real interest
rates and a deep industrial recession all point to an excessively tight,
rather than loose, policy. But many economists agree that the Bundesbank's
favoured analytic model remains valid: each percentage of above-target money
growth still appears to deliver a percentage point of above-target
inflation.
The reason for the confusion is that the Bundesbank is trying to control
inflation in a dual economy in which both parts are moving in opposite
directions. The private, industrial sector is starved of funds: deflation,
not inflation, is the problem. The International Bank Credit Analyst
estimates that bank lending to the west German private sector has fallen by
4 per cent this year, while wholesale prices fell 0.4 per cent in the year
to June. But the public sector is still growing and borrowing at an
unsustainable pace: bank lending to the public sector has grown 17 per cent
this year, driving up money growth and the non-traded components of consumer
prices.
The Bundesbank thus finds itself facing a dilemma. If the government will
not cut its borrowing, then all the bank can do is either to permit a higher
price level or attempt to offset this public profligacy with a fierce
squeeze in private sector credit, output and prices. But by doing so, it
risks damaging German industry, undermining public support for low inflation
and further weakening the ERM in the process. If the Bundesbank insists on
sticking rigidly to its short-term monetary and inflation targets, then it
must keep interest rates high. But both the bank, and the German government,
should be aware of the risks they run.

FT  23 JUL 93 / Leading Article: Motorway fatigue
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS EASY to make a case for turning part of London's M25 orbital motorway
into a 14-lane super-highway. The stretch concerned is the busiest section
of motorway in the country; it is only 7 1/2 miles long; the cost of
widening it will be small in relation to the congestion relief it will
bring; and the government says most of the rest of the motorway will stay at
four lanes each way, at least for the foreseeable future.
Yet the scheme cannot be judged so glibly. Short though the 14-lane section
may be, the fact that a highway of such proportions should be considered
acceptable anywhere in the UK crystallises the debate about how the country
is to cope with continuing traffic growth. If a 14-lane motorway is
acceptable now, will a 28-lane one be acceptable in another decade or two?
And a 56-lane one when the 28-lane one is full?
It sounds far-fetched: and the argument against is that traffic growth will
stagnate once car ownership reaches saturation point. Statistics, however,
show that traffic grows inexorably in line with gross domestic product. As
more goods and services are produced, more transport is needed to carry
them. With more time and money on their hands, people shop and travel more.
Governments impede this process at their peril. Yet environmental
considerations demand that they do something other than accommodate the
traffic jams with ever-increasing swathes of Tarmac. Even if technology
succeeds in producing a non-polluting car engine, the problems of land-take,
noise and visual intrusion are likely to prove unacceptable.
Sadly, the alternative most often favoured by environmentalists - more use
of the railways - will not provide the solution. Railways account for such a
small proportion of traffic (6 per cent of passenger miles and 7 per cent of
goods miles) that even to double their use would provide only a hiatus in
road traffic growth.
The best hope of bringing demand for road space into line with supply
therefore appears to lie in the mechanism used to regulate supply and demand
elsewhere: price. If people had to pay for using busy parts of the road
network, they might consider undertaking their journeys at a quieter time,
using public transport, or not undertaking the journey at all. Ultimately,
changes in land use and planning would bring people closer to where they
lived, worked and played, so restraining traffic growth.
In the meantime, the government needs to come up with a more coherent
strategy for dealing with traffic growth than has so far been in evidence.
People need roads, and more will have to be built, but there will never be
enough to meet unrestrained demand. If the government is serious about
resolving this conundrum, it could start by addressing the fact that Britain
not only has some of the worst traffic jams in the European Community, but
also some of the cheapest petrol.

FT  23 JUL 93 / Laden ship in less stormy waters: John Plender assesses the
likely price and prospects for the Fayeds' sale of House of Fraser
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN PLENDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The controversial Fayed brothers, owners of the heavily indebted House of
Fraser group, have demonstrated remarkable powers of survival through
Britain's recession.
But will the proposed flotation of their stores, other than the flagship
Harrods store in Knightsbridge which the Fayeds intend to retain, generate
enough cash to keep the bankers at bay and ward off the threat of
receivership?
Any judgment hinges primarily on the valuation of the subsidiary that owns
the shops in question, House of Fraser (Stores), where chairman Ali Fayed
stepped down earlier this week in favour of Mr Brian McGowan of Williams
Holdings. In effect, Mr McGowan is working for the group's bankers, who have
tightened their grip on the House of Fraser business empire following a
refinancing of debt at the end of April. As well as extending fixed and
floating charges to the whole group, including Harrods, 11 banks in three
separate syndicates have taken very restrictive covenants governing the
Fayeds' ability to dispose of assets.
The starting point for the analysis must be profit; and the record is
undeniably patchy. After the Fayeds' controversial takeover of House of
Fraser in the mid-1980s, a five-year plan presented to a banking syndicate
led by Samuel Montagu projected profits rising from Pounds 57m in 1986 to
Pounds 181m in the year to January 1991. Instead of this threefold rise, the
Fayeds' stewardship delivered a fall in profits to Pounds 40m at end-January
1992 for House of Fraser including Harrods.
Equally important, there is a credibility problem, arising from a Department
of Trade inspectors' report in 1988 which concluded that, in the course of
their original takeover, the Fayeds 'dishonestly misrepresented their
origins, their wealth, their business interests and their resources to the
secretary of state, the Office of Fair Trading, the press, the House of
Fraser board and House of Fraser shareholders, and their own advisers'. The
inspectors also detailed numerous cases 'where the Fayeds were plainly
telling us lies'.
This inevitably casts a further shadow over the record, which shows that in
the three years to end-January 1993 pre-tax profits of House of Fraser
(Stores), which excludes Harrods, went from Pounds 30.5m to Pounds 18.4m to
Pounds 32.8m. And the figures are not quite what they seem. In 1992, the
last year for which accounts are available at Companies House, more than
Pounds 12m of the Pounds 18.4m profit came from insurance payments for two
store fires, a surplus on the disposal of the company's credit operations to
a financial subsidiary of US General Electric, and a credit from the House
of Fraser pension fund.
Since accounts have yet to be filed for the year to January 1993, it is
impossible to analyse the quality of the Pounds 32.8m that House of Fraser
(Stores) is reported to have made. But on past form the figure may not be a
reliable guide to the sustainable level of profit that the stores are able
to generate.
As for assets, the Fayeds have retained a relatively high proportion of
freehold and long leasehold interests in their 59-store chain, when compared
with rival store groups, which lends apparent strength to their balance
sheet. But the figures raise a number of questions. Frequent revaluations
have produced the paradoxical result that in a period that included the
worst slump in retail property rents and values since the 1930s, and House
of Fraser itself saw a marked decline in its own profitability and dividend
cover, net worth rose from Pounds 503m in the mid-1980s to Pounds 811m in
1992. Even allowing for redevelopment and refurbishment, this looks
astonishing. It is also fortunate for the Fayeds, in that House of Fraser's
covenants to its bankers included a requirement to increase net worth by 5
per cent a year.
Taking House of Fraser (Stores) itself, property was in the books at Pounds
245m which, coincidentally, is the same as the company's net worth. But this
is on the basis not of an independent valuation, but a valuation by the
directors after taking 'independent professional advice'. The outcome, in
the year to January 1992, when property market conditions were exceptionally
depressed, was a revaluation surplus credited to reserves of Pounds 9.3m.
Against this background it seems unlikely that House of Fraser (Stores)
could be floated at anything near the average stock market rating for the
stores sector, where shares are valued at about 21 times earnings. For
purposes of illustration, assume a price/earnings multiple of 15, a
sustainable level of profit of Pounds 30m and earnings after tax of about
Pounds 20m. That profit figure may sound high, but after allowing for an
improving trend in UK retailing, the elimination of management charges from
the holding company, rationalisation benefits and other adjustments, it may
be plausible. A flotation might then be expected to bring in Pounds 300m -
not far from the Pounds 290m figure rumoured for a management buy-out that
failed to materialise earlier this year. How helpful would this be in
relation to the Fayeds' debt burden?
Working from data in documents recently filed at Companies House it is
possible to calculate that the House of Fraser group companies' loan
facilities and overdrafts after the refinancing on April 30 amounted to at
least Pounds 668m. Assume, for the sake of argument, that the Fayeds sell
the assets of another affiliate which they propose to retain, House of
Fraser Property Investment, which consist chiefly of the Barkers Centre in
Kensington, London, for close to their 1992 valuation of Pounds 122m; assume
equally generously that they make other disposals to bring total debt down
to Pounds 500m; and the result, after a flotation next year, would be a rump
of debt of Pounds 200m.
The move to float means that a decision has to be taken as to how much of
that debt should go into the balance sheet of House of Fraser (Stores). At
least half of the Pounds 200m could probably safely be included without
producing a ratio of debt to equity that would scare investors - quite
possibly more. The question would then be whether Harrods on its own could
service the rump of outstanding debt.
It ought to be possible for Harrods to raise operating profits before
interest, after writing back pension credits, from the Pounds 27m reported
in 1992 to at least Pounds 30m. That would be ample to service any plausible
interest rate on Pounds 100m of borrowings in today's market conditions. In
other words, there would be no difficulty in servicing the debt. That, of
course, is still on generous assumptions; and the leverage in the figures is
considerable. If market conditions called for a less generous price/earnings
ratio on House of Fraser (Stores) of nearer to 10, earnings came out way
below expectations and the asset disposals failed to generate the requisite
cash, then Harrods' operating profits might still have some difficulty
covering borrowing costs.
The Fayeds are not yet out of the wood. And any false move on the path to
flotation would raise, once again, the old question of whether their
personal resources outside House of Fraser Holdings can meet any shortfall
of profit against interest, which has been running at Pounds 26m before
exceptional items and tax in the last two reported years.
All that can be said here is that, in the few areas where information is
available, the going is getting harder - most notably at the Fayeds' Paris
Ritz Hotel, whose accumulated losses since acquisition in 1979 exceed Pounds
112m at today's exchange rates on the basis of the last filed accounts. Bank
borrowings at the Ritz were due to start being repaid in February this year.
There are countless imponderables in the equation. But given that the banks
have been prepared to refinance House of Fraser and that the economy has
turned, the odds are looking more favourable for the Fayeds' survival than
for some considerable time. It is certainly less likely that Tiny Rowland of
Lonrho, whose legal pursuit of the Fayeds grinds on in the courts, will have
the satisfaction of seeing an early forced sale of Harrods.

FT  23 JUL 93 / Letters to the Editor: Vietnam a serious regional competitor
for Thailand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DEREK TONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, William Barnes rightly draws attention to the 'electric' sparkle of
Vietnam today as well as to the dangers which investors face (' 'Beware the
paper in Vietnam tiger' ', July 20). However, he quotes one Bangkok-based
consultant, Chris Bruton, as saying: 'Vietnam now is nothing like as far
advanced as Thailand was in 1973. It's more like Thailand probably was in
1953.'
I was in Thailand during the 1950s and I can assure Mr Bruton that Thailand
then was light years behind Vietnam today. I can also assure Mr Bruton that,
in 1973, South Vietnam was considerably ahead of Thailand in the industrial
field and on a par in business and financial expertise. Today, Vietnam is
well ahead of Thailand in terms of computer sciences, satellite
communications, nuclear research, mathematical studies, literacy and
secondary education.
Because of the war years and serious mistakes in economic policy, Vietnam
has a long, long way to go to catch up with Thailand in terms of
infrastructure and industrial development. There are, however, few
industrialists and businessmen in Thailand who are not acutely conscious
that, delighted as they are to welcome Vietnam into the prosperity of the
rest of south-east Asia by ever closer political and economic association,
Vietnam probably represents for Thailand its most serious regional
competitor for the provision of goods and services, and this much, much
sooner than Mr Bruton might ever imagine.

FT  23 JUL 93 / Letters to the Editor: Benefits of classifying woodland as
set-aside
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr MARTIN LOWRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, James Buxton's article, 'When money grows on trees' (July 20), draws
attention to the difficulties of expanding Britain's afforested area in ways
that maintain the right balance between environmental benefits and economic
returns.
On Tuesday, the European Commission threw out an excellent opportunity to
help reach the correct balance when it refused to allow the UK's Farm
Woodland Scheme to count towards land which may be put into long-term
set-aside. This would give farmers an income from creating broad-leaf
woodland out of otherwise unused acres, and so contribute significantly to
the expansion of the country's forest cover - with all the associated
environmental and recreational advantages.
I have written to the EC Commissioner for Agriculture and Rural Development
urging him to rethink his decision.
If the concept of set-aside is to win broad public acceptance, it is
important that land going into the scheme is seen to bring wider community
benefits. The Farm Woodland Scheme - which combines landscape, ecological
and recreational elements - offers just such benefits. Unfortunately many
farmers have been holding back from participation in this valuable scheme
because of the current uncertainty about its relationship with set-aside.
I hope that our government will continue to press Brussels on this important
issue.

FT  23 JUL 93 / Personal Viewpoint: Folly of promoting ethnic divisions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MUHAMED SACIRBEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Talk is cheap - that is the familiar ex-pression. But for the Bosnians talk
has been anything but cheap. For well over a year, we have committed
ourselves to negotiations with a criminally brutal enemy because western
powers insisted that they would not allow an unjust outcome and that they
were prepared to enforce a just peace agreement.
As we gird ourselves for the next painful stage of resistance, we can look
back and clearly see what has made all the negotiations to date both
fruitless and dishonourable. We can thus define the circumstances under
which they can be more efficacious in the future.
So far, the negotiating process has been so flawed as not only to produce an
unjust outcome but actually to encourage further war. The reasons for this
flaw and the means to correct it are as follows:
1. Crimes and aggression have been committed against our people and republic
in the past under the convenient cover of negotiations. Negotiations should
no longer be abused and misused to undermine peace, and should only proceed
on the basis of an effective ceasefire guaranteed by the international
community;
2. The international community cannot morally, legally or diplomatically
sanction negotiations while the 'gun of genocide' is held to the head of the
Bosnians. This only encourages abuses by Serbian nationalist forces and
erodes the credibility of the international community.
The sieges and heavy weaponry around our cities must be removed or
neutralised. Humanitarian relief must be delivered, and the international
community must not allow the supplies to be blocked or looted.
3. The government of the republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina cannot be
confronted across the table by its ultra nationalist enemies while all
leverage is in their hands. This only emboldens extremists.
Such negotiations bolster those accused of war crimes, delegitimise
moderates, democrats and those committed to pluralism, encourage
fragmentation, and place the victim at the mercy of the aggressor.
The international community must be prepared to confront the aggressors if
they do not honour their commitments. At the minimum, the international
community must not obstruct or hinder the self-defence of the Bosnians.
4. Similarly, the international community must be prepared to implement
immediately any negotiated settlement.
5. Negotiations should be held within Bosnia and Herzegovina - preferably in
Sarajevo. This would increase accountability and discourage violations of
ceasefires and the denial of humanitarian assistance.
6. Negotiations and peace agreements should not exonerate war criminals.
Such a result would be immoral and illegal, and would backfire by
encouraging extremism and strengthening the hand of those who would
challenge peace. Criminals must be prosecuted.
It is unfortunate that the co-chairmen - in particular, Lord Owen - allowed
themselves to be drawn into killing off the Vance/Owen plan and giving undue
credibility to the 'Milosevic/Tudjman partition plan'. This predicament is
in part due to Lord Owen's acceptance of the proposition that Serb
extremists cannot be challenged and that war criminals may be legitimised as
peace negotiators. In turn, this has encouraged extremism and opportunism
among certain Croatian elements at the expense of moderates.
Most critically, if the co-chairmen continue down this flawed path they will
realise that, as they have abandoned the Vance/Owen plan and embraced the
partition, they will inevitably have to adjust their mediation position to
reflect almost any position promoted by the stronger party.
The Milosevic/Tudjman partition plan is acknowledged to be unjust. Just as
certainly, it is not durable. However, one argument that we can expect to be
advanced in its favour is the pseudo-humanitarian one.
We will soon be told that the main rationale for its implementation is the
alleviation of the suffering of the Bosnian peoples. But the partition would
in fact only worsen the refugee situation, promote instability, and create
new battle lines. Extremism, irreconcilable national hatreds, and fascism
would be encouraged and legitimised for decades.
The folly of promoting ethnic divisions under the auspices of the United
Nations should be reason enough to discard this ill-advised plan. Even as
the casualty lists in civilian areas under Serb bombardment grow, reading
like a roll-call of the republic's nationalities, all the members of the
presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, including Serbs, Croats and Moslems,
have embraced a rejuvenated peace plan for a 'federation' of the republic.
The republic will have a decentralised form of government, with each group
having parity at the federal government level. The individual units of this
federation (provinces) would be established on the basis of economic,
geographic, communications, historical and cultural criteria and would not
be seen as constituting 'ethnic enclaves'.
The federal model will promote the republic's future as a pluralistic,
democratic, and secular nation. While it may be difficult in the immediate
future fully to restore our nation to its multicultural tradition, this
federal system will encourage reconciliation and pluralism, and not allow
ethnic divisions permanently to scar our country.
The author is the ambassador to the United Nations for Bosnia-Herzegovina.

FT  23 JUL 93 / Letters to the Editor: Aerospace seeks investment not
subsidy (2)
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr RICHARD CABORN MP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your editorial attacking the trade and industry committee's
recommendations concerning the aerospace industry would have benefited from
a reading of the report, instead of just the summary of the recommendations.
The Pounds 100m of proposed expenditure is nothing to do with 'old-fashioned
industrial policies' or picking winning technologies. It would be for
maintaining a technological edge in the UK aerospace industry as a whole
across a range of technologies on which the industry's present and future
competitiveness depends. Moreover, launch aid is not a subsidy at all but a
loan repayable with interest, and is provided because of the market's
inability to fund viable long-term aerospace projects. In 1992-93 repayments
exceeded new aid by Pounds 27m.
Far from triggering an international subsidy war, the committee's measures,
all of which are consistent with the EC-US agreement, would simply bring the
UK industry into line with competitors; Pounds 100m a year is a tiny sum
compared with the subsidies given in the US. We do not share the optimistic
view that the EC-US agreement will keep in check government hand-outs,
especially as it does not cover aero-engines or smaller aircraft.
Your belief that the health of the UK aerospace industry can be judged from
present market share and new orders is astonishing. Its present situation
results from research and technology acquisition during the past 10-20
years. Its 'underlying position in world markets' is only as strong as the
effort it will be able to put into technology acquisition in the next decade
or so; hence the importance of the UK government matching the assistance
given to competitors.
Your call for multilateral agreement to push back subsidies is in line with
the committee's recommendation that the EC-US agreement be extended to
aero-engines.
What the committee opposes is the unilateral restriction of government
assistance in the UK to a level far below that available to foreign
competitors. The committee recognises that the UK aerospace industry has to
operate in the world as it exists, rather than in the world the FT would
like to exist.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Sir BARRY DUXBURY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I write to take issue with your interpretation of the House of Commons
trade and industry select committee report on the aerospace industry ('UK
Aerospace', July 22).
The report made clear that the industry is not a lame duck looking for free
handouts. It is a pillar of the UK manufacturing base - and of the British
economy. By exporting 70 per cent of an Pounds 11bn turnover, we make a
substantial contribution to the well-being of this country. However, our
current success is based on investment in high-cost technology almost a
generation ago.
Looking to the future, Richard Caborn and his all-party colleagues chose to
address some difficult questions about the conditions industry needs to
maintain a leading edge into the next century, about how we develop advanced
products for an increasingly competitive market, and about how we can best
use scarce resources.
They also looked at the long-term technology investments made by governments
in competitor countries and judged that UK aerospace was disadvantaged. The
report did not call for subsidies - it called for investment and for a
co-ordinated inter-departmental aerospace research programme. Furthermore,
it acknowledged the government's financial difficulties and sought creative
ways in which that investment could be added to the very high investment the
aerospace companies make in sustaining their technology base.
I recommend that those of your readers whose well-being depends upon the
competitive position of UK manufacturing industry, obtain a copy of the full
report. They will discover that the aerospace issues are more complex than
your editorial suggested, yet if the sensible recommendations of the
committee are adopted, the solutions may be readily achievable.

FT  23 JUL 93 / Arts: Fedora made for comfort - Bregenz Festival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Each summer Bregenz hosts an outdoor opera, with a spectacular lakeside
setting, and an indoor one in the Festspielhaus. As I write, it is
touch-and-go whether the opening of Verdi's Nabucco will be rained off the
lake and into the hall; but at least the premiere of Giordano's Fedora was
safe and comfortable.
Too comfortable, perhaps, in Jonathan Miller's production, for Giordano's
brand of Italian verismo. His first Fedora, Gemma Bellincioni, was after all
the fiery Santuzza of the original Cavalleria rusticana; and his opera was
based on a Sardou play (like Tosca) in which Sarah Bernhardt had starred.
Giordano hoped to match the success of his Andrea Chenier (1896), though
this time without the mob scenes. Again there is revolution in the air, but
mostly at a distance: after the rich Russian princess Fedora finds her
fiance murdered in St. Petersburg, the later spyings and betrayals are set
in Paris and the Swiss Oberland.
Miller's style of verismo is all genteel decorum - rather nicely observed,
but in need of hyper-emotional principals to suggest tormented inner lives.
Though Mara Zampieri's Fedora sings with unforced eloquence, matronly
concern is what she mostly conveys here; the role surely predicates more
volatility and voracious possessiveness. From Sergey Larin's Count Loris,
first her prey and then her lover too, we get ringing delivery, unarguably
good to hear, and plain, blunt acting. Alfonso Antoniozzi's cultivated
baritone is well found for the French diplomat De Siriex. Young Mary Mills
makes a fetching Countess Olga, the second soprano, a romantic soubrette
with daring taste in period costumes.
As her transient Polish lover Lazinski, Markus Schirmer is not required to
sing, but plays an artistic piano. Chopin pastiche, in a opera crammed with
pastiches - folk-Russian, French, even an offstage Savoyard song with
accordion and cowbells for the denouement in the Oberland (whither Giordano
transferred it: Sardou had kept it in Paris). Tobias Hoheisel's high, airy
sets, basically screens and scrim, are cleverly lit by Paul Pyant. However,
their platform base is set some way back, so none of the singers can
electrify the audience from footlights-distance - an unfair deprivation in
verismo opera.
The conductor Fabio Luisi is stylish and tender with the score, and in later
performances should find the extra thrust needed to buoy up his principals.
The Vienna Symphony is only moderately good at sounding Italian: as in
Catalani's La Wally a couple of festivals ago, the lively and picturesque
music comes off better than candid pathos or anguish. Still, the ear of
faith will certainly find and treasure those qualities in the luscious
melodies. Agnostics may not have their withers wrung.
Co-production with the Vienna State Opera. More performances until August 5.

Today BBC2 gives us another chance to see the 'Timewatch' programme about
the true character of Buffalo Bill (6.30). Then BBC1 offers us another
chance, actually the umpteenth, to see the episode of Dad's Army in which
Sergeant Wilson is to be appointed manager of the bank's Eastgate branch and
made a lieutenant in the Eastgate Home Guard (7.00). At 8.00 there is
another chance to see the episode of Casualty in which a crazed patient
attacks the staff and Ash considers promotion (BBC1).
At 9.00 comes Alas Smith And Jones with the two funny men joining the police
on a siege and 'probing the soft underbelly of the pop world'. This, too, is
'another chance to see', as is the Frank Zappa documentary on BBC2 at 11.20.
If you have broken both legs and simply cannot get out of the house, there
is Blooming Bellamy at 7.30 (BBC1) with the bearded biologist burbling about
herbal medicines; and the first in a new series of All Blacks (8.00 BBC2)
which tries to establish why there are now more black male prostitutes in
central London than white.

FT  23 JUL 93 / Arts: Rising to a challenge - Music
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The newest project on the London South Bank, which all this week fills the
Queen Elizabeth Hall and Purcell Room, will surely raise the spirits of
people unafraid of challenge in artistic experience. It is a summer festival
of modern arts, dominantly musical but with representation of dance and
film, and piloted by an artistic director who is him- (or, as may be, her-)
self an important creative force in those modern arts.
The series is planned as an annual event, with each time a different
director: this year the composer George Benjamin as programme-inspirer, next
year the composer Louis Andriessen. The umbrella title may rather be arty:
Meltdown, described in the advert-speak of the (cumbersome, ill-designed and
hard-to-read) programme as 'the white heat of creativity unleashed upon the
atmosphere - the fusion of art worlds into something new and totally
different'.
However, the chance to engage through this format with the mind, the tastes
and, indeed, the music of someone as profusely gifted, youthfully
stimulating and ebulliently communicative as Benjamin seems to me just about
irresistible - as the first musical item on the week's schedule proved.
This was a concert by the London Philharmonic in the QEH, proceeded by a
platform interview with Benjamin, and concluded with the first performance
of a new Benjamin work, Sudden Time.
The programme was itself a shapely, coherent entity which placed the new
work alongside pieces by Benjamin's two teachers - Messiaen (the London
premiere of the exquisite 1991 miniature Un Sourire) and Alexander Goehr
(the trenchant, subtle, substantial variations-set Metamorphosis/Dance, of
which the LPO gave the first performance 19 years ago).
Sudden Time, as Andrew Clements reported on this page last Saturday, marks
Benjamin's release into new creativity after a period of drought. Its
central examination - which the composer elucidated both in interview and in
a brief start-of-concert illustrated talk - is the difference between clock
time and psychological time. Across the work's short but abundantly filled
span, phrases of evenly pulsed shape are dispersed and then retrieved in
various parts of the large orchestra, while elsewhere contrasting and
sometimes contradictory activities are set up.
Sometimes conflict flares up, sometimes periods of near-stasis take hold,
but the sense of bubbling exploratory vigour remains potent throughout. In
testing out this notion of (to put it crudely) freedom versus rigid order,
Benjamin appears to have released in himself a flood of generous,
free-spirited invention.
The fast-moving linear patterns out of which the music is predominantly made
create a musical environment that, in its seductive harmonic ambiguities and
sound combinations, seems to bear a distinctly French-leaning aspect, to
look back affectionately and fastidiously on some of the key Diaghilev
ballet-scores - Firebird, Jeux, Daphnis. The scoring is complex, with
fascinating trouvailles (such as the brief consort of four alto flutes
topped by two tiny, high recorders) yet wholly unwasteful; a gently
unfolding viola line at the close suggests a prospect of reconciliation.
Any new initiative begins well that has so remarkable and exhilarating a new
work as its first offering. Benjamin himself conducted it with energy and
precision; the only cloud on the evening was the dull, colour-draining
time-beating of Franz Welser-Most in the Goehr and Messiaen.

FT  23 JUL 93 / Arts: Cartoons from a new master - Art
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LYNN MACRITCHIE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In an innovative series, the British Museum in London is hosting five
exhibitions of work by contemporary Japanese artists. Having missed the
first of these, I have vowed to miss no more.
'Takeda Hideo and the Japanese Cartoon Tradition', the second show, is a
revelation, a living history lesson and an opportunity to admire the work of
a controversial modern artist whose screen prints, based on traditional
subjects, seem to my eye at least the equal of the works of those revered
masters whose images he has reinterpreted with astonishing power and skill.
Takeda, born in Osaka in 1948 and originally trained as a sculptor, rose to
fame as the cartoonist for 'Asahi Journal.' His work was influenced by
western artists, most significantly Tomi Ungerer and Gerald Scarfe. He
visited New York several times and seems to have absorbed the deadpan style
of 'New Yorker' cartoons. All these influences can be seen in his earlier
work, which has very few obvious Japanese characteristics apart, perhaps,
from the thoroughness with which graphic styles from another culture have
been appropriated and reused.
His first published collection, 'Mme Chang's Chinese Restaurant' (1973), a
series of black and white cartoons presented as his dissertation in graduate
school, is already astonishing in its graphic fluency and enjoyment of
slightly surreal and sexual images. Two other collections, 'Yogi', 1974, and
'Opera Glasses,' 1977, are also in this style.
The Japanese have a long tradition of enjoying books of drawings and prints
which continues vigorously today, its most well known manifestation the
popular 'Mangas' or comic books devoured with relish by a considerable part
of the population.
Takeda's 'Altamira' series of 1979 is in the more sober tradition of picture
books on educational or scientific subjects. It is a series of black ink
studies of animal skeletons, meticulously observed and accurate, but each
with a touch of fantasy - a bony horse borne upwards on the wings of a bird
trapped in its rib cage, for example.
The series 'One Hundred Occupations' reworks a favourite genre which dates
back to the late 16th century. A delightful 1855 example by Hiroshige is on
display, showing dockers, actors, river porters and others at work, observed
with a humorous eye. Takeda's 'Occupations' is quite different. He uses the
ancient form to satirise his subjects mercilessly, in a cold, western manner
which brings a shiver to the spine rather than a smile to the lips.
The original 'manga' was a book by Hokusai, a collection of drawings from
life published between 1814 and 1849, of which several volumes are on view.
Each page is filled with incidents - drunken men singing while the geisha
who is 'entertaining' them falls asleep, ladies washing in all sorts of
positions, men practising with spears.
Some of the drawings have more 'fantastic' subjects, such as a man sawing
through his arm, or two men strolling unaware of the close scrutiny of what
appears to be an octopus. Takeda himself has never worked for mangas, but
his style, combining precise observation with fantasy, is very close both to
the ancient examples and their modern counterparts.
Best of all, however, are his two series of screen prints, 'The Wars of the
Minamoto and Taira,' the first produced in 1985, the second this year.
Displayed along with them are volumes by Kuniyoshi, the 19th century master
of the subject.
While Takeda borrows much from Kuniyoshi, his images are absolutely modern,
their stylistic innovations strictly 20th century. Unlike the old master,
who sets his incidents against a natural if stylised background, Takeda sets
his figures against plain backgrounds, concentrating on the swirling
patterns of bodies entwined in fierce fighting.
His warriors are naked, another break with tradition, but their bodies are
decorated from head to foot with complicated tattoos. Tattoos, a traditional
Japanese decorative art now most widely associated with the gangster culture
of the Yakuza, were the subject of his first set of screen prints, 'Mon
mon', produced in 1976.
Most controversial is his use of sexual imagery to contextualise the
warriors' deeds. In 'Mark of a Fan', an image directly based on Kuniyoshi,
women's legs represent the waves through which the hero rides. The birds
which cause the Taira to flee in 'The Battle of Fujigawa' emerge from
between a woman's thighs, their white curves forming the background to the
densely patterned mass of soldiers. The final images of the second series
show the defeat of the Taira in terms of the subjugation of their women,
literally ridden off by their conquerors.
While these images are horrifying, they are also entirely convincing, both
in relation to their ancient models and their modern counterparts, the
graphic novels and science fiction comics whose shifting viewpoints, bold
close ups and sexual brutality Takeda manipulates with genius. Whether the
unseen works by this self-proclaimed 'sadist' that have been judged too
shocking to be displayed transgressed this dangerous boundary it is
unfortunately impossible to tell.

FT  23 JUL 93 / Arts: A mish-mash from the RSC - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This is an unusual way to go down in the record books: Misha's Party must be
the worst play ever staged by the Royal Shakespeare Company.
True, it cannot have been initially the RSC's fault. The idea of
collaboration between the American playwright, Richard Nelson, and the
Russian Alexander Gelman, must have seemed attractive at the start, even
though Nelson says that he speaks no Russian and Gelman no English, and in
spite of the fact that Nelson's last venture at the Barbican (Columbus and
the Discovery of Japan) sank without trace.
At least the background was promising: Moscow, August 1991 and the attempted
coup against Mikhail Gorbachev as witnessed by a group of Russians and
Americans from a smartish Moscow hotel. And for about the first five minutes
promising is what it is. Screen subtitles and the sound effects of a crowd
remind us of the drama that is going on outside. There is a dining table
heavily laden with bottles which, one spots early on, is a sign of a long
night to come.
The rest is lamentable. This is domestic squabbling which merely coincides
with great events. You may search for wit, allegory or indeed any kind of
significance, but it will be in vain.
The principal character, played by Barry Foster, is called Mikhail. He has
been married several times and claims to have had hundreds of liaisons in
between.
On his 60th birthday, he has brought his ex-wives, their current husbands,
his bride-to-be and his daughter together. One assumes that there must be
some symbolism about Gorbachev, Mother Russia or the brief history of the
Soviet Union. If so, it is elusive. All that happens - or rather does not
happen - is that Mikhail's birthday speech remains undelivered.
The piece is being played concurrently at the Moscow Arts Theatre, where the
audience should be closer to events and may pick out subtleties. Try it
there, not at the Pit. Is there no one in the RSC administration capable of
spotting a loser in rehearsal and removing it from the programme before it
runs into the buffers?
*****
There are reservations, too, about the RSC's Taming of the Shrew which has
moved to the Barbican from Stratford. Just over three hours is a trifle long
for one of Shakespeare's slightest plays. The first two thirds are heavy
going.
Bill Alexander's production makes a couple of fundamental mistakes. He sits
the audience to the play within the play at the back of the stage almost
throughout. This is static and immensely distracting to the real live
audience in the theatre. Then the set is constructed of heavy wooden
panelling with a heavy wooden floor to match. The effect is deadening.
There are very few laughs. The production in Regent's Park earlier in the
summer was much funnier and the current performance of Much Ado About
Nothing at the Queen's shows that Shakespeare does not have to be treated
quite so ponderously.
Still, the Barbican show has its merits, notably Amanda Harris's lively and
attractive Kate and Maxwell Hutcheon's appealing Christopher Sly. One can
see why, for all its inadequacies, The Shrew remains a controversial play.
Is Kate a shrew and, if so, why? What is a shrew anyway? And even if she is
a shrew, does she have to be 'tamed' in quite such brutal fashion? Why does
she, particularly this one, succumb so easily? Discuss.
*****
The Chelsea Centre is not at the centre of Chelsea, but at the far (western)
end of the King's Road in London. I have wondered before whether it can make
it when it so far off the beaten theatrical track. Yet it is setting very
high standards. The present production is George Bernard Shaw's Widowers'
Houses. If you have never seen the piece before, see it now, for it reveals
a wonderful knowledge of the property market which has not much changed with
the decades. And even if you know the work, you will admire the direction by
Sharon Maughan and the wonderful playing of Sartorius by Lisa Harrow. She is
a very fine actress.

FT  23 JUL 93 / The Property Market: Framework for the future - London needs
a fresh strategic outlook, says an advisory group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'London is at a time of dramatic change. It needs a fresh strategic
framework to influence that change and give a clear sense of direction to
its future development.'
London Planning Advisory Committee.
Strategic planning has not been taken seriously in London in recent years.
In 1988, the last time the London Planning Advisory Committee, an
inter-borough body, put forward a city-wide planning framework, it was
virtually ignored by the government.
But the agonising over whether London is losing its way in the league of
Europe's top cities has renewed interest in the case for strategic planning.
That, together with the changed circumstances provoked by the impact of
recession on the capital, could lend more weight to LPAC's latest
consultation document, which covers topics such as the need for better
co-ordination between development and transport and environmental
considerations.
But the difficulties of laying down a planning framework is illustrated by
the extent to which conditions have changed for the office market in London
since LPAC's last guidelines in 1988. Offices require 'a radical shift in
strategic planning policy', according to the most recent LPAC report.
Instead of a shortage of supply, planning authorities need to manage the
surplus of existing office floorspace and cope with the huge excess of
development opportunity in the longer term.
This recommendation is based on employment growth projections in finance and
business services of between 30 per cent and 7 per cent between 1991 and
2006.
LPAC expects a minimal take-up of older, low-quality offices, which should
be put to alternative use, particularly housing and student hostels.
Using its most optimistic set of figures, LPAC estimates that demand for new
office space could total some 2.2m square feet a year from 1997  - half the
level during the 1986-90 period of rapid expansion. Under the pessimistic
scenario, demand for new space would be stuck in the current trough of about
500,000m sq ft a year.
Beyond 2000, take-up of new space could, at best, total some 3.5m-4m sq ft a
year, justifying new construction activity of about 3m sq ft a year, similar
to that in the early 1980s.
Such a level of activity could also justify developments of large-scale
projects of about 1.2m sq ft in areas such as the Isle of Dogs, King's
Cross, Paddington, Waterloo, London Bridge, Farringdon and Stratford in east
London.
LPAC notes, however, that there would not be demand for more than two or
three such schemes by 2006.

FT  23 JUL 93 / Technology: Designs on the future - Intergraph is weathering
a painful transformation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For a senior executive in an industry notorious for hype, Manfred Wittler is
refreshingly frank about trading conditions in Europe for Intergraph, the US
company that sells computer graphics systems.
In Italy, where the corruption scandal has brought corporate decision-making
to a halt, and in post-Olympics, recession-hit Spain, Intergraph's markets
are 'devastated', Wittler says. 'There are workstations sitting idle and
that's about as bad as you can get.'
Germany is 'terrible' - big customers have taken board-level decisions to
halt investments. Customers in the Mittelstand, the medium-sized independent
German manufacturers, have seen their orders fall by as much as 50 per cent
and are slashing spending.
After strong growth last year, Intergraph's sales in Europe are likely to
fall about Dollars 50m (Pounds 33.3m) to Dollars 400m this year. And some
European countries will make their first loss this year, Wittler warns.
Wittler is Intergraph's top man in Europe and also executive vice-president
for sales and support. The company makes everything from Cadcam systems used
to design and manufacture cars to mapping systems that help water companies
manage their sewage networks, so few people get a better view of sentiment
among industrial, utility and government users of computer graphics.
Fortunately for Intergraph, the view from Wittler's office, down the road
from Amsterdam's Schipol airport, is not one of unrelieved recession. In the
UK, too, the recession has cut leading clients' spending plans, but, Wittler
says, 'we don't see that any more'.
Intergraph has also been helped by the diversity of its customer base. With
about 40 per cent of its European business coming from government, utilities
and transportation, another 30 per cent from building and process industries
and the rest from manufacturing, the company has fared better than suppliers
who are more dependent on the mechanical Cad market alone.
But the company has also benefited from a series of changes introduced by
Wittler since he joined the company in 1989. By building up a true indirect
sales channel for the company's products, Intergraph is better able to take
advantage of continued computer graphics purchases by small companies or
divisions of larger organisations.
Another important move was the reorganisation of the sales force into
industry segments. In the past, Wittler says, Intergraph had not fully
exploited its biggest strength - its ability to provide a complete range of
products for all the technical needs of a particular industry.
An example is the transportation sector, which Wittler sees as one of
Intergraph's biggest growth opportunities. It has started a drive into the
railway industry, which is now undergoing a renaissance in continental
Europe.
The recession in Europe has coincided with what Wittler calls a 'painful
transformation' of Intergraph's technology. Because its applications
software was tied to its mid-range Clipper workstations, it could not be
sold easily through indirect channels.
Intergraph is now converting its 350 software packages so that they can run
on Microsoft's new Windows NT operating system. This is an important move -
Wittler believes it will open up a mass market for Intergraph's software via
indirect resellers.
But the company is also working on 'porting' - making compatible - Windows
NT to its Clipper Risc processor, which powers its existing Unix
workstation.
At the same time, Intergraph is developing a high-end workstation based on
Sun Microsystems' Sparc processor and earlier this month was chosen by Sun
both to co-develop the next Sparc processor generation and to port Windows
NT to the Sparc architecture.
All this activity emphasises the importance for Intergraph of tying its
future to that of Windows NT, which Wittler believes will be 'the big
winner' as an operating system - without totally supplanting Unix. As long
as software can run on Windows NT, the hardware will not matter.
Wittler's hope is that the European market will recover from recession in
the second half of next year, coinciding more or less with the completion of
Intergraph's technology changes.

FT  23 JUL 93 / Technology: Software finds a fashionable friend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DELLA BRADSHAW
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
First there was Ascot, then Henley. But the British summer season can only
truly be declared open when high street clothes shops display their end of
season 'sale' notices.
As fashion retailers rush to slash the figures on their garment price tags
they are increasingly having to ensure that those prices correspond to the
ones held on their computers. For the UK retail outlets of Paul Smith, the
men's fashion designer, the job has been simplified by work it has been
doing with its supplier Prologic, which specialises in software for the
fashion industry.
'We've been working with Prologic for four to five years,' reports Cuan
Hanley, co-ordinator at R. Newbold, Paul Smith's forthcoming retail venture.
'We've been moving in tandem.'
Initially when it came to sale time, employees at Paul Smith's head office
in Nottingham had to change the price for each item separately - every item
had a code denoting style, colour and size. Paul Smith's Covent Garden
stores stock eveything from toothbrushes to Pounds 600 suits - some 2,500
items in all.
The Cims (clothing industry management system) software was altered, says
Hanley, to ensure that the prices could be changed by product group. And if
one particular product group in one particular store was selling badly the
price of that group alone could be reduced. 'We can change all the prices
now in half a day,' reports Hanley.
Such speed of reaction is particularly important in the fast-moving fashion
industry where retailers have a rapid stock turnover - unlike a food chain,
for example, where the same brand of baked beans can be sold year in, year
out.
The reports produced by the Prologic software, points out Ian Bergin, at
Paul Smith's Covent Garden stores, can look at the stock levels throughout
the organisation or can track down a single garment. The software can
produce reports of bestsellers or 'worstsellers'.
'You can say 'I'm going to run out of this on this day and so I need to
order more now',' elaborates Bergin. 'You can see problems before they
occur.' The biggest problem would be if the stores ran out of the most
expensive items - suits.
If shortages occur, the individual shops can look up the stock held at the
warehouse and order items from the terminal which also acts as a till. Or
they can order from head office in Nottingham.
If they suspect shortages might ensue, each retail outlet can check to see
whether there is a similar style or fabric that could be stocked instead but
which they had hitherto overlooked - a shirt, for example, that was only
stocked in one of Paul Smith's Japanese shops.
The Prologic system, which is based round an Oracle database held at head
office, uses the data collected every time a sale is completed in the shop
to compile accounts and other management reports. The same data are used to
verify stock control levels. For the shop managers it means that there is no
need to back up the data every evening which is collected on disc, a
drawback which had become evident with the previous system in the Paul Smith
stores.
The system also helps eliminate errors. Because the code number for each
item has to be entered before a sale can be made, it can only be sold for
the correct list price. Barcode readers can be incorporated to help with
manual stock controls. And Cims lets retailers build in specialist services
 -such as automatic discounts for clients lucky enough to hold discount
cards.

Bad breath is not just something that affects humans. Scientists at
Southampton and Warwick Universities are developing an 'electronic nose' to
sniff out cows with bad breath, in an attempt to detect early signs of
disease and so improve the health of dairy herds.
The robot nose uses an array of sensors linked to a computer to sniff out

Teachers could soon be getting a helping hand from the latest technology. In
Japan NEC has used an expert system to cut the time it takes to work out the
school timetable.
The automatic school timetabling software combines an expert system
construction tool called Coastool with software that apportions the most
appropriate amount of time to each subject.
In trials at the Kukihokuyo High School in Japan's Saitama prefecture it
took seven working days to complete the 1992-93 timetable, compared with
manual scheduling, which takes 10 veteran teachers 10 working days (100 days
in all). NEC: Japan, 03 3789 6511; UK, 081 991 9697.

FT  23 JUL 93 / Technology: Zinc batteries pack more power - Worth Watching
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A New Zealand company, Voltech Agencies of Auckland, is claiming
revolutionary properties for a rechargeable alkaline battery.
The Voltech 555 batteries, which were developed in China, are cheaper than
nickel-cadmium batteries because they are made of less-expensive components

FT  23 JUL 93 / Technology: Taking the pain out of bacteria testing - Worth
Watching
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Helicobacter pylori (HP) is an unpleasant bacterium that has recently been
implicated in the development and recurrence of ulcers, writes Paul
Abrahams.
However, testing for the bacterium has been expensive, requiring the removal
of a section of the stomach, a blood test or complicated breath test.
Cortecs International, a small company in Isleworth, Middlesex, has launched
a method of testing for HP using saliva.
The saliva is collected on a swab and mixed with a colour reagent. This
reacts with antibodies in the saliva, which have been produced by the immune
system against HP. The test can give a result within 90 minutes. A Pounds
275 kit can be used to test 96 patients. Cortecs: UK, 081 568 7071.

FT  23 JUL 93 / The Property Market: Ratner's new jewel - The entrepreneur's
latest venture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Gerald Ratner, the jeweller who once famously described one of his products
as 'crap', does not appear to have lost his taste for controversy.
Nine months after leaving Ratners (now called Signet), Mr Ratner is again
raising eyebrows with his choice of passage back into the retail industry.
He is attempting to convert Tobacco Dock, the failed shopping centre in
London's Wapping, into a US-style 'factory outlet mall'.
Factory outlet shopping - where manufacturers sell surplus stock directly to
the public at discounts of between 40 per cent and 60 per cent - is fiercely
resisted by many retailers. Unlike the US, where factory outlet malls are
typically at least an hour's drive away from a city, in the UK towns are so
close to each other that such outlets would inevitably compete with town
centres, say retailers.
Mr Ratner's task is to persuade manufacturers, which are inevitably
reluctant to offend retailers, that Tobacco Dock will not threaten their
markets. He is sending brochures to 1,000 manufacturers and admits that he
has to 'break down some barriers' to win over prospective tenants.
Mr Ratner is confident he will win the argument over Tobacco Dock's
perceived threat to existing London shopping centres. 'Docklands is not a
successful place for shopping. It will not cannibalise other markets,' he
said.
That much cannot be disputed. Tobacco Dock was in receivership from November
1990 until last October when it was bought for Pounds 12m by Bisley
Properties, a private group which took on Mr Ratner as an adviser. Tobacco
Dock's failure was blamed on its inaccessibility and poor transport links.
Tobacco Dock's location could remain a problem: the solution depends on
persuading well-known brand-name manufacturers to participate in Mr Ratner's
factory mall in a bid to attract shoppers from as wide an area as possible.
Mr Ratner is convinced that there will be no difficulty in attracting
shoppers. 'People will be coming down from Scotland,' he says rather
implausibly.
Mr Ratner's move into factory outlet shopping follows a recent visit to the
US. He became convinced that the success of factory outlets in the US could
be replicated in the UK (where such outlets exist, but on a relatively small
scale). He joined Bisley Properties on his return to the UK.
The logic that persuaded Mr Ratner that the UK is ready for factory outlet
centres has also impressed a handful of developers from the US and the UK
which are working on such schemes in Britain.
But Mr Ratner thinks that Tobacco Dock, which could have its first
manufacturers in place in two months, will be Britain's first US-style mall.

FT  23 JUL 93 / Management: Nothing to do with ability - Some of the
pitfalls of employee appraisals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ADRIAN FURNHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Customer satisfaction surveys and rating forms are, like traffic wardens,
ubiquitous. Hotels, airlines, restaurants, even churches provide cards and
forms asking customers to rate their services, products and personnel. But
few people offer feedback, so some institutions offer incentives such as a
free drink or a cheap calculator to encourage customers to comply and
improve the response rate.
Most managers also have to evaluate the performance of their subordinates by
completing an appraisal at least once a year. For some this is a bit like a
school report, with the most common comments being 'satisfactory' or
'adequate'.
Given the general loathing of unstructured report-writing, most
organisations devise appraisal forms where boxes are ticked to indicate the
quality of performance against various criteria.
Even so, rating others may be deeply counter-cultural to the British, though
popular in the US. British people prefer to fudge with pleasant but
meaningless phrases. Despite - or perhaps because of - the fact that Britons
have experienced the capriciousness of school or university grading, they
resist inflicting it on others.
Many managers dislike rating subordinates precisely because such evaluations
are supposed to be objective and impartial; they know all too well the
errors and injustices that can occur in the process.
Perhaps the most common error is the halo effect.
It is not unknown for female secretaries and personal assistants to be
selected more for their legs than their word-processing ability. All
interviewees know that appearance may be as - if not more - important than
ability in getting a job. Most attempt to create a positive halo by
emphasising their best qualities.
A second cause of error and lack of objectivity lies in being too lenient or
indeed too harsh.
The error is called central tendency. However long the rating form, and
whatever its contents, some managers routinely tick all the central boxes on
the rating form and avoid the extremes. They do so because they do not want
to over-praise an individual and thereby raise expectations of promotion or
salary increase. They also avoid the low scores because they want to avoid
controversy over the appraisal and dealing with the anger, sulking and
resentment of a poorly-rated subordinate.
The result is that everybody comes out as average and the whole exercise is
a waste of time.
A third problem is memory, also called recency bias. Managers rarely keep
detailed notes and do not always remember all the behaviours they have to
rate. It has been said that if workers score any significant success nobody
remembers, but if they make a big mistake nobody forgets. Certainly most
people base their appraisals on the recent past, no matter how
representative it is.
There is also the question of personal bias and prejudice. This may be overt
or covert, sophisticated or simple. We all have our preferences and
prejudices based on past experience, and it is often difficult to prevent
these influencing appraisal ratings.
Thus notwithstanding the quasi-scientific, and certainly numeric, feel of
evaluation and appraisal forms, many managers complain they are far from
objective. They argue there are so many sources of bias that appraisals are
not only worthless but dangerous.
However, people can be taught to use the forms effectively. Coffee tasters,
for example, are open to errors when rating beans, but they can learn to
overcome them. When it comes to managing people, it is crucial the staff are
appraised and given accurate, specific and comprehensive feedback. Filling
out forms encourages such feedback and can be most helpful. Most managers
would like their boss to provide them with detailed feedback - but they all
seem more hesitant about appraising their staff - often because they do not
know how to conduct progress reviews with subordinates.

London, and advises organisations on management appraisal systems.

FT  23 JUL 93 / Management: Alive and kicking in the US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER LORENZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Total quality management is alive and kicking within large US companies, in
spite of the problems some of them have had with it in the past few years.
Almost all those which have initiated TQM are continuing or intensifying it.
They expect it still to be one of their top initiatives by 2000.
These are some of the conclusions which emerge from a study* of member
companies of the Business Roundtable, an association of more than 200 large
corporations. The study, which drew responses from 106 companies (90 chief
executives and 92 'quality officers'), was carried out by Delta Consulting
Group, a New York firm.
Delta has a strong professional interest in rehabilitating the image of TQM
at a time when many large companies have been seduced by the more
dramatic-seeming promise of business process re-engineering. But that does
not make its findings any less striking.
Delta's president, David Nadler, has argued - in common with some
re-engineering consultants - that TQM and re-engineering are complementary
and companies would find it counter-productive to drop one in favour of the
other.
TQM, if handled properly, delivers gradual but continuous improvements in
many aspects of business performance, while re-engineering attempts to
create a more dramatic impact on business processes over shorter periods of
time. It employs some of the same tools and techniques as TQM.
In the Delta study - Ten Years After: Learning about Total Quality
Management - chief executives reported two particular problems with TQM: it
took longer than expected to take effect; and some senior managers were
still not sufficiently skilled in it.
Quality officers generally saw more problems than the chief executives did.
They were more negative on: senior management knowledge and skill;
conflicting values among key senior managers; the lack of perceived need for
change; and strong resistance to change.
The 'top TQM company' most admired by the respondents was Motorola, followed
by Xerox, Milliken, AT&amp;T, Ford, Corning, Federal Express, GE, 3M and IBM.

FT  23 JUL 93 / Management: Culture vultures - Cigna's UK operation has
reaped the benefits of re-engineering
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ADRIAN MICHAELS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONTRARY to the gospel preached by several re-engineering evangelists,
experience has taught Susan Kozik not to start the process without first
launching a programme of culture change, especially for middle managers. She
and her colleagues confound conventional wisdom in other ways, too -
including how they handle people who resist change.
Kozik is a vice-president of Cigna, a US insurance company, and a leading
member of its internal re-engineering team. Since 1989 she has seen at close
quarters the varying success of re-engineering in the insurer's 10
divisions. They all have projects either completed or under way, but the
methods used have changed considerably in that time.
In particular, emphasis has been shifted to beginning cultural change a few
months before the start of a re-engineering programme. 'In some of our
earlier efforts we had not held enough meetings of all staff in time to
prepare them for the new language and thinking of re-engineering,' Kozik
says. Without this and other cultural initiatives such as the introduction
of team-based pay incentives, change tends to be rejected quickly when it
does arrive, Kozik says. It then takes far longer to reap any benefit from
re-engineering.
Cigna's experience with cultural change has been put to good use over the
past two years in its UK arm, Cigna Employee Benefits. In mid-1991, four
months before it started to introduce cross-departmental business processes
in place of a functional hierarchy, staff began meeting Kozik's group twice
a day to learn about re-engineering and teamwork. Later, teams of staff were
rolled out and put to work in newly designed business processes. The
meetings were used by staff to review work done and to set goals.
Since then Cigna's UK operation, which specialises in group health
insurance, has turned six separate business functions into two processes
based on pre- and post-sales activities. The time it takes to give a quote
has been cut from 17 days to two, and staff who used to process between 35
and 40 claims a day are now working through 75 to 90 a day. As a result of
this - and a move from the south-east to a lower-cost site in Greenock,
Scotland - more than Pounds 1m has been shaved off costs. The unit's
underwriting loss of Pounds 2m in 1992 is set to become a profit of more
than Pounds 2m this year.
It is not solely because cultural change came first that things have gone so
well.
Cigna has other ways to tackle managers who dig their heels in. First, all
managers are interviewed by the re-engineering team before a decision to
start change is taken. They are asked what they think about change and their
attitudes are carefully recorded.
Not everyone can be persuaded. Once the UK team had decided to go ahead, in
spite of the expected resistance from particular people, it accomplished
something novel to the parent company.
'The easiest thing to do with senior managers who do not like re-engineering
is to go round them,' says Roger Dockett, managing director of the UK
operation. 'But we have actively sought to put people most resistant to
change in some of the project's first positions of responsibility. We did
lose about 5 per cent of staff this way, but we have won over a lot more.'
Dockett says that two senior managers had their jobs changed very early on.
'At first they felt very threatened because decisions they were used to
making every day were being taken by much more junior staff. Now they
realise that as leaders of a whole process they have much more opportunity
to influence the organisation.'
Another way of increasing staff commitment would also raise a few eyebrows
in the UK. The initial process design was fairly cursory, and in some cases
non-existent. Cheerfully, Dockett says the abiding principle has been 'do
it, test it, fix it'.
The first time this was tried in the post-sales part of the business two
people, each from administration, claims and accounts were taken from their
desks and seated together round a different desk. Management's instruction
was simply to carry on with their jobs. A few days later the group was
processing far more claims.
Allowing a cross-functional team to design a process shows a measure of
respect for junior staff that is not immediately apparent in all other
companies trying to re-engineer themselves. Kozik says that some of the US
divisions of Cigna were scared to let more junior staff embrace the changes
in this way. 'After our first programmes we learnt that you can trust the
teams. Management who tried to hand down changes were missing out on the
most knowledgeable group of people. For smaller process changes we now allow
staff to design the new processes. For broader changes we use the teams as a
source of ideas.'
Both Kozik and Dockett say that, if staff are working in processes that they
have built, many cultural changes follow more naturally - such as pride,
process ownership and a team mindset. It is an effective way to change staff
attitudes without stand-alone cultural seminars and training programmes.
Cigna has also made 15 per cent of individual salaries related to the
performance of the team. That figure, too, was decided by more junior staff.
Kozik says: 'Too many top managers assume that staff do not want to risk
their salary. Why not go out and ask them how much they want to risk?'
By contrast, Cigna's first re-engineering project in the US 'did not discuss
reward systems early enough', Kozik says. 'We had introduced teams but not
team goals. Whether teams will go the extra mile for the customer depends on
monetary and non-monetary rewards.' Kozik does not pretend that Cigna's UK
re-engineering is the only way to approach the subject. 'You cannot clone
re-engineering. This is not something you can learn from a book. It's about
people and personalities.'

FT  23 JUL 93 / Survey of European Building and Construction (8): A growth
track - but from 1994 - The Netherlands
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RONALD VAN DE KROL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DUTCH construction industry is poised for a return to growth in 1994,
boosted by the prospects of several big public sector infrastructural
projects, particularly in railway construction.
Overall, production in the construction sector showed a further 1 per cent
decline in 1992 and is projected to fall by more than 3 per cent this year
as worries about the likelihood of recession lead many companies to put off
investment.
But recovery seems set to take hold, albeit cautiously, next year, helped
both by expectations of higher economic growth for the Netherlands as a
whole as well as by the government's aim to improve the country's
infrastructure.
However, the Netherlands' three biggest construction companies - Hollandsche
Beton Groep, Volker Stevin and Boskalis - are so international in
orientation that their fortunes will also depend crucially on the state of
the construction market in other countries including Britain, which appears
to be climbing out of recession, and Germany, which is still in the grips of
economic malaise.
HBG and Boskalis will also be affected by the outlook for the global
dredging sector, where overcapacity appears to be waning and prices are
firming.
Last year, this international outlook meant that all three construction
groups posted higher profits, despite the continued weakness of the domestic
market.
The Dutch government's plans to invest more heavily in infrastructural
projects over the rest of the 1990s look likely to help not only the entire
sector but also those companies which specialise in railway construction.
Although new procurement rules in Europe mean that some of this work will go
to competitors in other companies, Dutch construction firms are expected to
benefit most from the orders in the pipeline.
The biggest but also the most controversial project is the proposed
construction of an all-freight railway line linking the port of Rotterdam to
the German border. The Fl 6.2bn (Dollars 3.3bn) 'Betuwe Line', named after
the fruit-growing region through which it will pass, is designed to enable
Rotterdam, the world's largest port, to retain its traditional role as a
conduit for goods passing to and from Germany's industrial Ruhr area to the
sea. Con- struction is set to begin in the mid-1990s, with the railway
itself due to open in the year 2000.
However, a vociferous 'Not In My Backyard' campaign by local residents could
force the government to search again for new ways of keeping disruption and
nuisance to a minimum. One proposal, vigorously opposed so far by the
government, is to put the entire 72-mile railway line under ground. This
would inevitably push up costs, but the additional work would be welcomed by
the Dutch construction industry.
A second railway project is the planned construction of the high-speed TGV
train link between Brussels and Amsterdam as part of a wider effort to
connect the capital cities of north-west Europe. Work on widening train
stations and putting down new tracks has already begun, but controversy
still surrounds the exact choice of route south of Amsterdam and Amsterdam's
Schiphol Airport. Opposition by environmentalists to the TGV passing through
a nature reserve is not expected to lead to any major delays in
construction.
Besides these big projects, the public sector is also expected to pour more
money into new ministry buildings, schools and hospitals as well as into
roads and tunnels, some of which will be partly funded by the private
sector.
A major project aimed at doubling the size of Schiphol Airport by the first
decade of the next century is already under way, providing additional
support to companies operating in the public sector and generating related
orders in road and tunnel building.
These public projects in the non-residential market will buoy the sector in
1994 as private sector investments in office buildings and industrial sites
slowly begin to revive, supplying a second motor for the industry's growth.
Residential construction - which has been virtually flat in the past couple
of years, with a projected drop in 1993 likely to cancel out 1992's small
rise - is not expected to play a big role in the recovery, at least not in
comparison with the stimulus provided by infrastructural projects.

FT  23 JUL 93 / Survey of European Building and Construction (7): Scars that
may take long to heal - The Nordic countries: The outlook after the
recession ends
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR THE Nordic region's beleaguered construction groups, the market collapse
of the past few years must at times have felt much more severe than a normal
cyclical downturn.
The crash in Finland and Sweden, in particular, has been harder than
anything they have experienced in the past 50 years, although economic
recession and high interest rates have also taken a severe toll on building
activity in both Norway and Denmark. Heavy job losses and bankruptcies have
been common to construction companies in all four countries, while the
related collapse in real estate values has done more than anything to create
the region's wider financial sector crisis.
The immediate outlook is not much brighter. Norway can point to some
encouraging signs - office vacancy rates have started falling, for example -
and at least its government can finance big infrastructure investments
without putting too much stress on its budget. That is not the case in
Finland or Sweden where building activity looks set to slump further both
this year and next. Danish builders, meanwhile, may see an upturn in the
domestic market next year, but they are likely to find the going harder in
eastern Germany where contracts over the last two years have done so much to
cushion them from the impact of domestic recession.
Part of the reason that Sweden and Finland seem to be in a deeper mess is
that the downturn reached them later in the cycle and factors other than
severe economic recession have added to their difficulties. The decline in
Sweden has been accentuated by the removal of many of the government
subsidies which fuelled the building boom of the late 1980s.
Construction volume has fallen by around 50 per cent in the past three years
and investment is down from SKr237.5bn in 1990 to an estimated SKr195.8bn in
1993. One in four building workers has lost his job since 1991; employees in
the sector have fallen from 320,000 to 235,000, amid some estimates that the
figure could drop below 200,000 by the middle of next year.
One of the worst affected sectors has been housing. Investment in new
housing has halved since 1990 to an estimated SKr32.9bn this year, with the
Swedish Construction Federation predicting a further halving next year to
just SKr16.4bn. Office building has also fallen off sharply after the
over-development of the 1980s.
But some areas have held up much better, including road construction,
rebuilding and maintenance work. These sectors are also expected to be
growth areas in the short term, although not to the extent that they offset
the decline in housebuilding and office construction.
The best piece of news the Swedish construction industry has received
recently came in March when the government announced plans to spend SKr98bn
on new road and rail networks over 10 years. A total of SKr36bn has been
earmarked for the 1993-94 to 1995-96 period.
Critics allege, however, that the timing and scale of the investments are
too uncertain to give the market a feeling of optimism, and that in any case
infrastructure investments of SKr10bn a year are not enough to offset the
industry gloom.
Several big projects are being lined up, including the construction of a
railway from Stockholm to Arlanda (where Stockholm's airport, 40km to the
north of the city, is located) and ring-roads round Stockholm, Gothenburg
and Malmo.
However, no infrastructure development is bigger than the proposed
bridge/tunnel over the Oresund strait between Sweden and Denmark. This
project, on which construction was originally supposed to begin this year,
has been delayed by environmental and political wrangles and the firm
go-ahead has still not come from either Denmark or Sweden. Few expect
construction work to begin before next year.
For many of Sweden's smaller and medium-sized construction groups, the
market downturn has already resulted in bankruptcy. For the bigger
companies, it has meant heavy losses and weakened balance sheets but major
rationalisation and re-orientation have so far ensured survival.
Scandinavia's largest construction group, Skanska, made a SKr3.14bn net loss
last year, largely because of property write-downs and losses on financial
operations. The downturn in the Swedish construction activity had a clear
impact on its performance, with revenues from this sector falling 11 per
cent to SKr17.45bn from SKr19.6bn. Overall revenues fell to SKr31.9bn from
SKr34.7bn.
One of the ways in which the group has responded to the crisis is by seeking
to boost its overseas operations, though that has not proved easy as many
other western markets are also in recession. Recent efforts have focused on
the east European markets, where construction demand is likely to grow in
the years ahead. The group has opened offices in Berlin, St Petersburg and
Tallinn in the past year.
Skanska says the outlook for the Swedish construction market remains
depressed, although the market 'will probably reach the bottom next year,'
according to Mr Lennart Hallberg, a senior vice-president. Even when the
recovery does get under way it will be weak, says Mr Hallberg, and the boom
construction years of 1989 and 1990 will never return.
NCC, another big Swedish construction group, suffered a SKr1.2bn loss after
financial items last year, with large property write-downs again largely to
blame. But it has also pursued a vigorous rationalisation programme and
repositioned its activities to survive the downturn.
'Although we expect the construction market to continue to shrink, NCC's
product mix, with a high proportion of roadwork and civil engineering
products, corresponds favourably with the anticipated areas of market
growth,' says Mr Torsten Eriksson, the group's president.
Nevertheless, there is a real worry that if the downturn continues for much
longer, the construction industry will not be able to respond effectively
when the economy recovers its balance. The Swedish Construction Federation
has already warned that if the government does not take more active measures
to encourage building activity now, the result in the second half of the
1990s could be capacity shortages, overheating and inflation.

FT  23 JUL 93 / Survey of European Building and Construction (9): Dams
lessen the drought - Spain: Apart from government plans, the outlook is
bleak
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SPAIN'S construction industry can thank its lucky stars that it rains less
and less on the domestic plain. A state of sustained semi-drought in the
past years has prompted the government into unveiling major dam building
projects.
The sector is fortunate also that the government, which is obsessed with
raising Spain's competitiveness and with narrowing the gap with the European
Community through the ambitious convergence programme it has mapped out for
itself, has made road building a priority.
All in all, the government has pledged Pta18,000bn over the next 15 years,
an accumulated total of Pta1,200bn a year, for civil engineering works. 'The
promises and the programmes of those in charge of economic policy in the
coming years guarantee continuity (for the sector)' Seopan, the construction
industry federation, noted in its newsletter last month.
Outside the government's plans, the outlook is bleak. The number employed in
construction was down to just 1.1m at the end of the first quarter of this
year, 7 per cent below the sector's total labour force at the same stage
last year.
Inevitably, the industry has been an early victim of the accelerated
slowdown of the Spanish economy, which is now officially in recession. The
GDP recorded 0.7 per cent negative growth in the last quarter of 1992 and
shrank by 1.1 per cent in the first quarter of this year.
Last year, 104,100 construction jobs were lost, most of them in the second
half of 1992, and a further 40,000 jobs vanished in the first quarter of
this year. Cement consumption fell by 16 per cent in the first three month
of this year.
However, Seopan sees signs of a silver lining. In April the rapid decline of
jobs in the sector braked sharply as unemployment rose by just 2,200. Cement
consumption in April fell by only 11 per cent, bringing the accumulated loss
over the January-April period down to 14 per cent.
The chief reason, virtually the sole one, for the silver lining was a
recovery in official tenders. Provisional figures for contracts through to
the end of April rose to Pta529bn, which was more than double the total over
the same period last year in constant pesetas.
The official tenders came from right across the administrative board.
Contracts by the central government were up by 41 per cent, those tendered
by the regional authorities increased by 52 per cent and those by local
authorities were up by 61 per cent.
The lion's share of the increased contracts originated from the Public Works
ministry with a 387 per cent rise in tenders. This department is providing a
lifeblood to the sector with the 15-year long infrastructure programme.
The major road building projects that are already under way include an
east-west motorway along Spain's northern coast, a north-south one that will
run alongside Spain's western border with Portugal and a third, originating
in Valencia on the Mediterranean, that opens a new route into France via a
tunnel system midway along the Pyrenees mountain range.
The ministry has also earmarked major improvements to secondary road systems
and to big city ring roads.
The national hydraulic plan is still in the blueprint stage but it involves
considerable dam building activity to transfer water resources from the
wetlands in the north of the country to reservoirs in the dry central area.
If the full infrastructure programme is implemented, then the construction
sector can look forward, in the very worst of scenarios, to a prolonged
period of stability based on the 1992 levels. The sector underwent a
shake-out last year when growth stopped short in its tracks but, thanks to
the onset of the infrastructure programme, that drop may have marked the
industry's nadir.
The 'if' is however very much an operative word. 'We will lean towards
pessimism until we see what the 1994 budget looks like,' says Mr Victor
Martinez, a construction industry analyst at Madrid brokers AB Asesores.
Analysts fear that the ministry's spending spree could be trimmed by
budgetary constraints.

FT  23 JUL 93 / Survey of European Building and Construction (5): After the
dust clears, recovery can start - Italy: The award of public contracts has
been paralysed by a political scandal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER COOPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THIS IS an exceptionally difficult year for the Pounds 80bn Italian
construction market. A sharp downturn in the business cycle has coincided
with a major scandal over public sector contract awards.
The market forecaster Cresme predicts a 5 per cent fall in total
construction output in 1993. But even that could prove optimistic. There was
a 17 per cent fall in cement consumption in the first quarter of the year
which points to a much bigger decline in construction output.
At the moment the award of public sector contracts is virtually paralysed by
the Mani Pulite (clean hands) inquiry. Ten of the top 15 Italian contractors
are under investigation for the alleged illegal funding of political
parties. The biggest name in the industry, Pounds 750m-a-year
Cogefar-Impresit, heads the list; other companies include Pounds 230m-a-year
Grassetto and Pounds 360m-a-year Lodigiani.
More and more contractors, politicians and government officials have been
implicated in the scandal surrounding the alleged payment of party political
contributions to secure public sector contracts. So far this year, the
number of such contract awards has slumped by more than two-thirds.
The Pounds 16bn-a-year public sector construction market is in disarray.
Large civil engineering contracts are the hardest hit by the crisis. But the
Pounds 2bn-a-year public sector building sub-sector is largely unscathed. A
five-year modernisation of barracks for the Carbinieri and a prison
rebuilding programme are unaffected.
The crisis is also damaging private sector work. Planning permission is at
present almost impossible to obtain in the big Italian cities because
everyone is afraid to take a decision that might attract the magistrates'
eagle eye.
'The wave of scandals has not only blocked public sector contracts worth
Pounds 12bn a year, but has also shut down Pounds 42bn worth of private
sector projects,' says Mr Riccardo Pisa, president of the National Building
Association. 'There is no longer anyone who has the courage to approve any
type of scheme.'
Market commentators think things will get worse before they get better. 'The
government will have to cancel projects like the high speed train to reduce
its budget deficit,' says Professor Aldo Norso of Milan University. 'Public
spending on construction will fall.'
Recovery hopes are pinned on the private sector which, contractors believe,
will become more involved in infrastructure development. There are reasons
for optimism. Italian motorways are tolled, and their development could be
financed privately. Italians are also the biggest savers in Europe, and
might be persuaded to invest directly in infrastructure schemes.
Of more immediate interest to contractors are the proposed giant commercial
building projects, such as the plan to build a Canary Wharf-style financial
district near the Garibaldi station in Milan. These developments are stalled
by the political crisis. Nonetheless, property agents report a shortage of
high quality office space in Italy as well as inadequate hotel accommodation
and retail space. A commercial building boom is in prospect in the near
future.
Mr Paul Bacon, of Milan-based commercial property agent Healey &amp; Bacon, says
there is a shortage of quality office accommodation in Milan, with less than
two years' supply. He points to many opportunities for retail chains.
'Out-of-town shopping is very underdeveloped in Italy and many of the big
international names are absent from the high streets,' he says.
However, commentators do not see the commercial building market improving
greatly until a new government is elected in the autumn and confidence is
restored in the Italian economy.
Mr George Soros, the well-known Wall Street investor, currently rates Italy
as having the best investment potential of any country in Europe. Italian
contractors hope others will heed his advice, and look for investment
opportunities at the bottom of a very deep business cycle.
WT Partnership, the British quantity surveyor, has established a 12-strong
office in Milan in anticipation of a private sector boom. It hopes to advise
developers on new projects.
'We see the current political crisis clearing in the next 12 months,' says
Mr Roy Merritt, a WT partner. 'Electoral reform should provide the catalyst
for economic stability. The situation is already improving in Milan with the
election of a new mayor and council. Italy is going through a quiet
revolution, and those looking to take part in the recovery should be making
a move now, not next year.'
This year the private sector has benefited from a fall in long-term interest
rates from 15 to 11 per cent. The devaluation of the lire last September has
also helped to keep the private sector competitive internationally. All the
same, Cresme still sees a 6 per cent decline in commercial and industrial
construction output in 1993, before a 1 per cent upturn next year.
Consumer confidence has taken a tumble during the political upheaval.
Forecasters say the impact of the crisis on both private purchaser
confidence and public housebuilding activity will depress housing starts
from 278,000 last year to 265,000, despite a sharp fall in mortgage rates
from their 18 per cent peak last December.
But most market analysts think a new government will succeed in cleaning up
the system. It would have a revolt on the streets if it failed to do so.
Feelings are running very high among contractors and materials producers who
are seeing their businesses ruined.
So it is more than likely that the Italian construction industry will
somersault from seemingly intractable public paralysis to private
prosperity. The industry is at a major turning point. It is shifting its
focus from the public sector to private-led development with international
participation.
Yet this is a horribly painful process for those trying to earn a living
this year: 1993 will be a difficult period for Italian contractors and
material producers. Even the infamous Italian 'Black Economy' is in for a
rough ride, with Cresme forecasting a 4 per cent fall in activity to Pounds
11bn this year.

FT  23 JUL 93 / Survey of European Building and Construction (6): Help may
not be enough - France: The likely impact of the Balladur government's plans
for public works
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FRENCH construction market has been in decline since the second half of
last year. Despite the rescue programmes announced by the new conservative
government, most construction companies and building producers expect output
to fall further this year.
At best, turnover will be flat next year. Few companies expect much growth
in 1994.
Recovery, they say, will have to wait until the French economy improves.
While unemployment continues to mount, consumer confidence will remain weak.
The public will spend less on goods and manufacturers and shops making and
selling them will continue to lay off workers.
As a result, companies are more likely to close factories and reduce
operations rather than invest in new buildings and better facilities.
Lafarge Coppee, the French cement producer and one of the world's biggest
building materials companies, says that sales of cement in France during the
first six months of this year fell by more than 10 per cent.
The rate of decline is likely to slow in the second half, says the company,
only because comparisons will be made with a very poor second six months in
1992. Even so, it expects cement sales in its home country to be down by
about 8 per cent this year following a similar fall in 1992.
Government and independent forecasters have suggested that the fall in total
construction output will be between 2 and 3 per cent this year. Contractors
and building materials producers believes this understates the true extent
of the steepness of the downturn which they say is more in line with the
decline in cement sales and one of the best guides of construction activity.
Bouygues, among the country's biggest builders and civil engineers, has
forecast a 6 per cent fall in its French construction turnover, including
road building, this year.
Most contractors expect total construction output to fall by at least 5 per
cent this year, despite plans by the government to encourage higher spending
on public works and housing.
Mr Edouard Balladur, the prime minister, hopes this will be achieved through
a mixture of tax incentives, increased borrowing capacity for local
authorities and subsidised mortgage rates for the poor.
The government's plan, announced in two stages during May - and with further
proposals likely - involves freeing an extra FFr18bn (Pounds 2.05bn) to be
spent on public works during the next two years.
Part of this will be channelled through a five-year programme of jointly
financed central and local government projects, mostly roads, due to be
completed by the end of this year. Authorities are to be allowed to raise
more money to enable this to reach its target of 97 per cent completions,
instead of 86 per cent currently.
A new five-year programme is to be announced shortly and will provide a
further guide of the government's determination to use the construction
industry to revitalise the French economy.
Extra public money is also to be found to enable very large infrastructure
projects, which had ground to a halt because of lack of funds, to be
completed.
Beneficiaries are expected to be the Tunnel du Somport, a road tunnel
through the Pyrenees and the A86 orbital motorway around Paris.
The industry has welcomed the fillip but points out that many of these
schemes were already in the programme. The extra FFr18bn, provided it can be
raised, compared with a total spend on construction last year, excluding the
do-it-yourself market and black economy, of more than FFr650bn.
The government has also moved to assist the housing market with a programme
of tax and interest rate incentives which it hopes will raise the number of
homes built by 30,000 during the next 18 months.
High real interest rates and fear of unemployment have severely weakened the
French housing market. The number of new home starts last year fell by 8.5
per cent to 277,000 from 303,000.
Mr Pierre Bosset, French construction analyst with stockbrokers James Capel,
says that builders expect housing starts to fall to about 250,000 this year.
'The Balladur plan might add another 5,000 starts this year and perhaps
another 10,000 to 15,000 next year but is unlikely to add more. Housing will
remain a difficult market while companies are announcing redundancies daily.
French interest rates are still high by comparison with Britain,' says Mr
Bosset.
Overbuilding in the late 1980s means that investment in office construction
is unlikely to improve even when the rest of French construction recovers.
Paris is estimated to have four years' supply of offices either built or in
the process of construction, much of which will need to be taken up before
new schemes are contemplated.
Private investment in factories and shops will not improve until the general
economy recovers and consumer confidence increases. There are few signs of
this happening in the short term. Gross domestic product is expected to fall
by about 1 per cent this year while the unemployment rate is forecast by the
French National Institute of Statistics to rise to 12.5 per cent.
Meanwhile manufacturers, which have suffered under the French government's
policy of protecting the franc's value through high interest rates, have
been running down stocks and closing unused production capacity.
Government efforts to encourage housing and increase public works will take
time to work through and at best may only stem the decline in construction
output rather than reverse it. Contractors and building material producers
can expect more pain in the second half of this year. Recovery may have to
wait until 1995.

FT  23 JUL 93 / Survey of European Building and Construction (4): Bonanza is
some way off - Why the outlook for the industry in Germany is now less
cheery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHILE Germany's manufacturing industry is suffering its worst recession
since the end of the second world war, its construction industry is still an
engine of economic growth - but only up to a point.
As a recent report from the Hypo-Bank economics depart- ment concludes, the
outlook is becoming less cheery here, too, despite boom conditions in
eastern Germany.
The western industry - worth DM320bn last year - still dwarfs the sector in
the east, worth DM57bn. Though growth in the east is set to continue at a
double-digit rate, in the west the recession is beginning to take effect.
Last year total construction activity in western Germany rose by 5.6 per
cent - after growth of 4.1 per cent in 1991 and 4.9 per cent in 1990. The
current year's growth is likely to fall back to less than 1 per cent.
This conceals a sharp turnaround in two out of Germany's three main sectors,
reflecting the depth of the recession and the impact of public spending cuts
in western Germany. Only house- building is set to grow this year, while
industrial and public sector construction are both in decline.
According to the DG Bank, private sector industrial construction in the west
will fall by 2 to 3 per cent - after growth of 4.7 per cent in 1992 and 4.8
per cent in 1991. This reflects a time-lag effect as German companies scale
back their construction plans, after a 2 per cent reduction in investment in
machinery and equipment last year.
In the public construction sector in the west, there will also be a fall of
2 to 3 per cent, the DG Bank predicts. As the Hypo-Bank comments: 'To
approach the goal of reducing debt .. (regional) governments can hardly
avoid reducing public building expenditures  .. the financial strains
imposed by the solidarity pact (between unions, government and business) and
the associated shortage of public funds are becoming increasingly evident.'
The bank expects a drop of at least 2 per cent in real terms in government
expenditure on construction this year.
The third - and still prospering - leg of the west German construction
sector is housebuilding. Growth in this segment of the market, which
accounts for 50 per cent of the western total, is set to be 3 to 4 per cent
this year. This is half the growth rate of 1992 but the fundamentals are in
favour of further, steady growth throughout the 1990s.
One factor is that - in spite of the international brouhaha over the
Bundesbank's monetary policy in the last year - long-term interest rates are
at historically low levels. This acts as a stimulus to private
housebuilding.
However, the main reason for growth here is what Hypo-Bank calls a 'gaping
hole' in the western German housing stock. Some 375,000 units were built
last year but the bank calculates that the unfulfilled need is as high as 2m
units in the west alone.
This reflects high levels of immigration into the country - 438,000
asylum-seekers came to Germany last year and a further 231,000 immigrants.
Social change - the tendency of people to live in ever-smaller family groups
 -also plays a role.
In the east of Germany, there was a substantial drop in the number of new
homes built last year: just 11,500 units were built compared to 62,500 in
the previous year. About 30,000 houses will be built this year. The low
level of activity - to some extent compensated for by high levels of
expenditure on modernisation of old housing stock - reflects social and
economic insecurity as east German citizens worry about mounting
unemployment.
Commercial construction in the new Lander (states) rose by a third last year
to DM26.3bn, about half of the total activity in the east. The pace of
growth is likely to slow as western companies feel the impact of the
recession and many have already cancelled plans for investment in the east.
But Hypo-Bank is predicting growth of DM5bn in this sector this year -
stimulated by a vast array of government incentives including investment
bonuses, simplified write-off opportunities and cheap finance.
The main dynamic for the eastern construction sector will be the state -
partly, indirectly, via subsidies to the private sector - but also directly.
Direct public sector expenditure grew by 38 per cent last year to DM14.3bn
and is set to climb by at least DM3bn this year as the federal and regional
governments fulfil their commitment to bring east German infrastructure up
to western standards.
This will provide a bonanza for the construction sector - for domestic and
foreign contractors, for suppliers of building materials and for skilled
craftsmen. The hope is that this will act as a stimulus for a regeneration
of the eastern German economy as a whole. For the time being, it is enough
to ensure that the German construction industry will avoid the worst of the
malaise currently afflicting the manufacturing sector.

FT  23 JUL 93 / Survey of European Building and Construction (2): Dynamism
can emerge from the wreckage - The face of former communist eastern and
central Europe is being transformed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Soviet Union, which was built during a dozen five-year plans interrupted
only by war and post-war reconstruction, crumbled virtually as it was being
built. The mighty dams, steel plants and factories of the first five-year
plans were built with forced labour fresh from the countryside, using poor
quality steel and worse quality cement. Housing was neglected for three
decades, except for a handful of Gothic skyscrapers in Moscow and other
cities and the blocks built largely by German prisoners of war in the
immediate postwar period.
Then came the shoddy, barrack-like housing blocks with cheap, tar-paper
roofs, low ceilings and poky rooms built around the fast-growing cities by
Khrushchev in the late 1950s and 1960s. Finally, Russia was disfigured by
endless rows of uniform, factory-built housing blocks which made Soviet
cities virtually indistinguishable, whether in the freezing tundra or the
semi-deserts of central Asia.
All were built the same way from concrete panels assembled on site by giant
cranes during President Brezhnev's long, mediocre regime in the twilight
years of communism.
As a general rule, anything of architectural merit in the Soviet world was
either built before the revolution or in that brief post-revolutionary
moment when architects like Menshikov and the constructivists managed to put
up the odd house or trade union office in super-modernist style.
The low quality of most construction work, and the combined effects of poor
maintenance and a harsh climate, have left Russia and the post- Soviet
republics with an inadequate and decaying housing stock, over-sized
factories, dangerous nuclear power stations and rotting infrastructure -
from railways to highways which need replacing fast.
The collapse of the official economy, however, has led to cutbacks in mass
housing and other building works, but a boom in private dacha building
around Moscow and the big cities.
Longer term, the collapse of central authority and rapid, if chaotic,
privatisation is expected to lead to a spate of largely uncontrolled
building of low rise housing in the outer suburbs and a huge volume of
small-scale renovation work as owners of newly privatised shops and flats
make good decades of neglect.
The first indications of this are already apparent. But the clearest signs
of things to come can be seen in former communist east and central Europe
where the face of the cities and even villages has been transformed by such
developments over the last three years.
Eventually, the reformation of the economies of Russia and other former
Soviet republics, especially the energy and raw material rich ones, will
create demand for repairs, facelifts and new construction which will in
itself become a powerful engine of future growth.
This internally generated dynamic will be assisted by billions of dollars of
international aid money and foreign finance, initially from the World Bank
and other institutional lenders, which will find tangible expression in the
building of telecommunications networks, the rebuilding and expansion of
road and rail links, the modernisation of ports and airports, and a crop of
new warehouses, new offices and hotels, new factories and refineries across
the board.
At present, much of the former Soviet construction industry is in crisis; it
needs a massive infusion of new ideas, new equipment and new management. But
those who can look beyond the current and inevitable political turmoil and
confusion see an economically dynamic Russia emerging from the wreckage of
communism in the early part of the 21st century. It will be then on the way
to fulfilling the potential for growth and development which made Russia the
fastest-growing economy in the world in the decades before the first world
war.
The preconditions for such growth are higher output and efficiency of the
oil and gas industries, coupled with greater energy efficiency. This will
ensure a rising exportable surplus while privatisation of agriculture and
the agro-industrial and distribution sectors will end the hard currency
drain of food imports.
Western construction companies, energy and agro-businesses will play a vital
part in reconstructing the former Soviet economy, once Russia and other
resource-rich states such as Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan earn the hard
currency needed to buy services and attract investment from abroad. They
will come in after the current confusion over laws, ownership and political
competence is replaced, as it surely will be, by a clearer set of rules,
backed by law and a remodelled state.
What can be achieved is already visible in Poland, Hungary and the Czech
republic which are the main recipients of foreign investment but also the
most advanced in revamping their laws to European standards, stabilising
their currencies and establishing government according to parliamentary
rules.
Exbud, the privatised Polish construction company now quoted on the Warsaw
stock exchange, is one of many Polish construction companies which is not
only busy building western-style factories, hotels and office blocks in
Poland but is among many central European construction companies helping to
rebuild eastern Germany and win contracts in western Europe and further
afield.
At the same time western construction companies, architects and building
service companies, including British construction companies such as Bovis,
are actively seeking work in the region. In one notable development YRM, a
UK-based building design consultancy with several overseas hotel projects
behind it, has joined Higgs and Hill (Overseas) and the city council of
Prague district 6 in a consortium to design and build a world-class hotel
and office complex in the grounds of the Praha hotel. Built in 1981 for the
exclusive use of the Communist party central committee, this boasts a large
park, is close to the city and only 10 minutes from the airport.
Meanwhile, central European cement and glass companies have been high on the
list of foreign investors anxious to secure new, low-cost sources of
construction materials in anticipation of a long and sustained boom in
construction work over the next decades.
Similar thinking lies behind a raft of strategic investments by Asea Brown
Boveri, Siemens, General Electric, Westinghouse and other energy-related
engineering companies. All believe that big contracts will eventually come
their way as east and central Europe makes safe its Soviet-designed nuclear
power plants and tackles air and water pollution problems by installing new
anti-pollution equipment or replaces wasteful and polluting old plant.
In the meantime, their investment in modernising production facilities in
this region is already paying off by giving the parent companies new,
low-cost, sources of components and equipment which help to keep overall
costs low and improve competitiveness in western markets where wage costs of
skilled workers are often 10 times higher.

FT  23 JUL 93 / Survey of European Building and Construction (3): UK
activity fails to sustain a bright start to the year - A downturn in
prospects
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
OPTIMISM that the worst UK construction recession in memory might be
loosening its hold has evaporated since Easter.
The revival in the UK housing market, which contractors and building
material producers hoped would presage a more general recovery in
construction, has weakened as consumer confidence has deteriorated.
Inquiries from potential purchasers have slowed as concern about the state
of the British economy has failed to ebb. The outlook for other areas of
construction also remains weak. Private investment in factories, shops and
offices is unlikely to recover until other manufacturing and service
industries see some improvement.
The general consensus among contractors and building material producers is
that the industry is either bumping along, or, only very gently, floating
off the bottom. They are still waiting for indications that a more enduring
revival is about to take root.
Overbuilding during the late 1980s means that office construction is
unlikely to recover even when other areas start to improve. Office building
by the end of this year is expected to be running at almost half the peak
level achieved in 1990.
Industry forecasts* suggest that the fall in total construction output,
including repair and maintenance work, could be restricted this year to just
0.5 per cent depending on the strength of the recovery in the private
housing market.
This would follow output declines of 5.5 per cent in 1992 and 9 per cent in
1991 according to the joint forecasting committee of the construction
industries. The committee, which includes representatives from government,
contractors, building material suppliers, banks, building societies and
large industrial customers, is forecasting only a 0.5 per cent rise in
construction next year.
Companies, therefore, are desperately concerned that ministers should not
seek to cut public spending on construction as they battle to reduce a
public sector borrowing requirement that is forecast to reach Pounds 50bn
this year.
Sir Robbin Biggam, chairman of BICC, the engineering group which owns
Balfour Beatty, the construction company, says a reduction in government
spending on road programmes, or the curtailment of projects such as the
extension to the Pounds 1.8bn Jubilee underground in London, would ensure
that any tentative recovery would be 'halted in its tracks'.
The underground extension has been delayed by differences between the
government and bankers of the failed Canary Wharf Docklands office over the
private sector's Pounds 400m contribution. Contracts for large parts of the
development have been agreed in principle. It is one of the very few big
projects where construction could start almost immediately. To lose the work
would be a serious blow.
Work is so short that profit margins on many construction jobs remain low to
non-existent with contractors bidding at prices that barely cover expected
costs. In some cases jobs are being taken at a projected loss with
contractors hoping to make up margins by making claims against changes in
design and contract specifications which occur on many jobs. Construction
lawyers are likely to be very busy over the next few years.
Increased prices for plasterboard, structural steel, glass and concrete,
announced earlier this year, are adding to the concerns of contractors,
already working on very low margins.
Sir Brian Hill, president of the Building Employers' Confederation, the
largest employer organisation, warned earlier this month: 'Our markets are
suffering from a lack of consumer confidence caused by political and
economic uncertainties, speculation about possible tax increases and a
continuing fear of unemployment.
'This is having a particularly severe impact on the private housing market
which, having shown an improvement in prospects in the spring, has now
faltered with reservations and house sales falling since the beginning of
May.'
A confidential survey of sales returns by 15 of the country's largest
housebuilders, compiled by the Housebuilders' Federation, reveals a sharp
fall in visitors to show houses since the beginning of May.
Net reservations - sales on which deposits have been paid, less
cancellations - rose by about 10 per cent during the first two weeks of June
compared with the corresponding weeks last year. Weekly sales this spring
were running more than 35 per cent higher than last year.
At one stage during a four-week period at the end of March and the beginning
of April, net reservations were as much as 50 per cent higher than last
year.
House sales traditionally slacken during the summer and builders hope that
they will see a return to much higher levels of demand in September and
October. Comparisons ought to look good against last autumn, when house
sales plummeted as interest rates fluctuated wildly ahead of Britain's
decision to withdraw sterling from the ERM.
Builders, nonetheless, remain very nervous. They are concerned that some of
the steam appears to have gone out of the market after a good start to the
year.
Until the UK housing market starts to enjoy a more consistent revival, it is
hard to see other areas of construction recovering. A recovery in general
contracting may not occur until 1995. Trading conditions are likely to
remain tough. Building material producers, however, may be helped by lower
costs and higher prices as conditions start to ease.

FT  23 JUL 93 / Survey of European Building and Construction (1): All quiet
on the sites - Companies face a tough year as the economic climate remains
dull. Governments are turning to the private sector for infrastructure and
building projects, but the removal of Community trade barriers has so far
had little impact
</HEADLINE>

THE European construction industry, like the economy of the region, is in
retreat. Building output is faltering in almost every European market. Even
in Germany, construction growth is expected to halve this year.
Economic recession, high interest rates and mounting unemployment have hit
exports and undermined consumer confidence. Instead of spending, Europeans
are worrying about their future job prospects and are saving or repaying
earlier debts.
Private investment in homes and by manufacturers and service industries,
accounting for about 60 per cent of European construction, has declined as
demand for these products has fallen.
New car sales in western Europe declined by 1 per cent in the first six
months of this year and by 5.3 per cent in June compared with June last
year. German car sales in June fell by 17.4 per cent.
Companies are unlikely to invest in improved premises or new buildings while
their own sales remain weak. Public sector spending on construc- tion is
unlikely to see much improvement, either.
Governments faced with declining tax receipts and struggling to contain
mounting budget deficits are poorly placed to make up a shortfall in private
investment.
Over-development of offices in the late 1980s has left too many empty
buildings chasing too few tenants in many European cities. Financial
services, which had expanded rapidly during the 1980s, have been hit
particularly hard by the recession, leading to large job losses in the
sector and decreasing demand for office space.
Olympia &amp; York, the Canadian-based property devel- opers owned by the
Reichmann family, was brought to its knees, and with it several construction
sub-contractors, by the failure of its Canary Wharf office development in
London's former Docklands which had been expected to rival the City of
London as a new financial centre.
Other European cities have also been left with large amounts of unsold and
unlet office premises. This will continue to inhibit rents and sale prices
even when other areas of construction start to recover.
Paris is estimated to have at least four years' supply of offices either
built or in the process of construction.
French building and civil engineering markets have declined rapidly since
the second half of last year, as the steep recession in construction which
overtook Britain and Scandinavian countries several years earlier, spread to
other European nations.
The French government has forecast that total construction output will
decline by between 2 and 3 per cent this year. Contractors and building
material producers, however, believe the fall will be greater.
Bouygues, one of the country's biggest builders and civil engineers, has
forecast a 6 per cent fall this year in its French construction turnover,
including road building. Lafarge Coppee, one of the world's biggest building
materials companies, says that French cement sales fell by more than 10 per
cent during the first six months of this year.
It forecasts that French cement sales will fall by about 8 per cent during
the year as a whole.
Construction orders in Italy, which rely heavily on public patronage, have
fallen sharply as the financial and political scandals that rocked the coun-
try have paralysed central and local government decision- making.
Many of the scandals involve construction and building material companies,
several of which are being investigated for alleged illegal funding of
political parties.
Spain, Europe's fastest growing construction market during the 1980s, has
also gone into reverse as the national economy has declined and big building
projects for the Barcelona Olympics and last year's World Trade Fair in
Seville have ended.
The Netherlands, which sells about a third of its exports to a declining
German economy, is expected this year to endure a modest fall of about 3 per
cent in construction output, as is Belgium.
Other European countries likely to experience a decline in construction
activity include Switzerland, Norway, Sweden and Finland which is forecast
to see the biggest fall in construction output in 1993 of approaching a
fifth.
The disintegration of the Soviet Union, previously Fin- land's most
important trading partner, has severely reduced export opportunities for the
Finnish construction and building materials industries.
The severe economic and pol- itical problems facing some for- mer communist
eastern Euro- pean countries has meant that construction opportunities,
despite the high demand for new and improved infrastructure in these
markets, have failed to materialise in the way that had been hoped.
Political uncertainty in many of these countries has made it very difficult
to raise finance from the developed world for much needed civil engineering,
industrial and housing projects.
The exception is in eastern Germany where the house construction and
renovation, in particular, is growing rapidly according to Lafarge Coppee.
Redland, Europe's biggest roof tile manufacturer, RMC, Europe's biggest
conc- rete producer and a large cem- ent producer in eastern Germany, and
BPB Industries, Europe's biggest plasterboard manufacturer, have all
reported strong German sales during the first six months of this year,
particularly in the eastern region.
Overall growth in German construction is forecast to halve this year to 4
per cent, following a 9 per cent rise in output last year. In spite of
slower growth, the industry remains strong, outperforming the rest of a
German economy struggling to meet the cost of integrating the former east
German republic.
By comparison, Britain which, like some Scandinavian countries, entered the
reces- sion earlier than many of its other European rivals, is still
struggling to get over the decline in activity.
A revival in UK house sales has slowed since the spring, although these are
still likely to be higher this year than last. Other areas of construction
remain severely depressed with investment in private industrial and
commercial premises not expected to improve until there is a more sustained
recovery in the rest of the UK economy.
Even when construction output starts to pick up in European markets, the
recovery may be laboured and is likely to lag general economic recovery.
EuroConstruct, representing construction research agencies and economic
forecasting bodies in 15 European countries, expects output in the region to
fall by 1.9 per cent this year with only a 0.2 per cent rise expected next
year.
The downturn, although dep- ressing, is not as bad as the construction
decline in the early 1980s, says EuroConstruct. The exceptions are in
Finland where the fall in building and civil engineering orders is the worst
since the 1930s; and in the UK where falling construction output has been
compounded - unlike in previous recessions - by falling commercial and
residential property prices.
The German housing market provides the brightest perspective in an otherwise
depressing European construction outlook. The number of housing units
completed by builders in western Germany is expected to rise from 375,000 to
420,000 this year. The last time this was achieved was in 1977. Housing
investment in eastern Germany is expected to rise by 25 per cent this year
with the number of units completed rising to 30,000.
The sluggishness of Euro- pean construction markets means that the removal
of trade barriers between European Community countries has so far had little
impact on international contractors, which have fared better in the booming
construction markets of southern Asia. That situation seems unlikely to
change much over the next 18 months.

FT  23 JUL 93 / Names face writs to recover losses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LLOYD'S of London may issue writs in the next few weeks on four Names
unwilling to pay losses, the first such legal actions since the spring of
last year.
In another sign that attitudes towards rebel Names could be hardening, Mr
Peter Middleton, chief executive of Lloyd's, was sharply critical of an
alternative business plan for the market circulated by Mr David Springbett,
a former insurance broker.
Explaining the legal move, Mr Middleton said the insurance market's
authorities were targeting those Names - individuals whose assets support
the insurance market - who 'can pay but won't pay'.
Lloyd's is continuing to work on a debt-recovery policy, after the end of a
six-month moratorium on writs against Names in April this year.
Mr Middleton described the Springbett plan, which envisages the transfer of
all Lloyd's liabilities up to this year to a new company, as 'commercially
naive'. New investors would then pay a slice of future profits to help the
company meet these claims. Mr Middleton said this would reduce Lloyd's
capacity to pay dividends to investors.
'Why would anybody want to invest in such a vehicle? Why would anybody be
interested? You could expect a negligible response from corporate
investors,' he added.
Mr Middleton was also critical of Mr Springbett for advising Names to vote
against a resolution supporting the present management in the postal ballot
which was organised following an extraordinary general meeting of Names this
month.
'If the resolution is not passed corporate capital will shrink back from
investing in Lloyd's,' he said. The advice was 'solidly illogical'.
Separately Mr David Rowland, the market's chairman, said that Lloyd's agents
were now becoming more confident that more Names would be able to continue
underwriting next year and that capacity - the amount of capital available
to support insurance activities - might not decline below its present level
of Pounds 8.7bn.
Earlier this year it was widely expected that capacity would fall by at
least 25 per cent next year, with Names resigning or being forced to stop
underwriting.
Lloyd's is nevertheless continuing its efforts to persuade individuals and
institutions to invest in new corporate Names, with UK merchant banks,
including BZW and Samuel Montague, now involved. US banks such as JP Morgan
made most of the initial running in supporting Lloyd's corporate capital
initiative.
Meanwhile Lloyd's announced that it is to appeal against a ruling by the
Charity Commissioners that refused to award charitable status to the Lloyd's
hardship fund, which helps Names to avert bankruptcy.
More than 2,000 Names have applied for hardship, but only 181 offers have so
far been made and 81 accepted.

FT  23 JUL 93 / Chambers fear fall in sales to EC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GROWTH OF manufacturing exports slowed in the second quarter amid fears that
deepening recession in other European Community countries and a stronger
pound could threaten the UK's competitive advantage, according to a survey
published yesterday.
In an extensive survey covering 9,000 companies in the services and
manufacturing sectors, the British Chambers of Commerce reported that sales
and orders of manufacturing exports did not improve in the three months to
June. For the second consecutive quarter only one in five companies reported
higher export sales and orders.
The overall conclusion from the quarterly economic survey was that the
recovery re-mains broadly based and grad-ual, with domestic demand on a
steadily upwards trend.
Small companies continue to lag the bigger ones, with only one in 10 small
businesses enjoying growing order books.
The balance of manufacturing companies enjoying higher domestic sales
compared with the previous quarter rose from 5 per cent to 19 per cent.
There was a similar jump in performance of service-sector companies. A
balance of 27 per cent of companies reported higher quarter-on-quarter
sales, against only 13 per cent in the first three months of the year.
The chambers' main concern was export markets. 'Our ability to compete
internationally remains patchy,' said Mr Christopher Stewart-Smith,
president of the chambers.
While worries about inflation and interest-rate levels had eased, there was
concern that the UK's competitive edge which followed devaluation might be
eroded.
There was good news on investment. Manufacturing and service-sector
companies revised their investment plans upwards. The rise in sales in the
second quarter has also led to an increase in the number of firms working at
full capacity, with 22 per cent of manufacturers claiming no excess.
A regional breakdown shows the Home Counties and the Thames Valley at the
forefront of growth in the second quarter, with both regions experiencing
strong rises in export and domestic demand.
Although the improved performance by the manufacturing sector was fairly
evenly spread across the country, Scotland and Northern Ireland lagged
behind other regions.
Demand for exports in Scotland slowed and manufacturing confidence was poor.
In Northern Ireland the weakness was concentrated in domestic sales which
fell over the quarter, while manufacturing exporters improved on first
quarter growth.
In the service sector, export growth was fairly buoyant, with the southern
regions reporting strong performance. Even in London, sales growth in the
service sector was higher than the national average.
The chambers found the most worrying development in London was the sharp
fall in the rate of growth of manufacturing exports. In addition, employment
intentions in manufacturing industry were worse in the capital than anywhere
else in the country.
Growth in the east Midlands continued to be buoyant, with exporters
maintaining sales growth and increasing orders.
The economy in the north-east continued to perform well in manufacturing and
services, but growth in orders in both sectors slowed.

FT  23 JUL 93 / Hospitals may merge to form flagship trust
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PROPOSALS to amalgamate London's recently opened flagship Chelsea and
Westminster Hospital into a single trust with St Mary's, Paddington, are
under consideration.
The move could eventually include the Royal Brompton specialist heart
hospital. It illustrates the extent to which a struggle for survival among
London's leading hospitals is provoking changes far beyond those envisaged
in the government's Tomlinson report into health care in the capital.
The development also shows that the National Health Service reforms are
forcing individual hospital managements to act in a competitive style
unknown before 1991.
An amalgamation between the two hospitals would create a trust to rival the
combined Guy's-St Thomas' Trust, currently the largest in the NHS.
Managers at St Mary's, who have proposed the move, fear that economies of
scale will enable Guy's-St Thomas' to win contracts to treat patients from
large areas of inner London.
They estimate that rationalisation of services through a similar
amalgamation would enable St Mary's-Chelsea and Westminster to fight back by
reducing contract prices by an average of 6 per cent.
The 665-bed Chelsea and Westminster, the largest single hospital development
in the NHS, opened this year amid controversy over whether it should have
been built at all.
Critics say it has unbalanced the NHS market in west London. The merger plan
is being considered by the Chelsea and Westminster management, as well as
the Department of Health.
Many of the capital's teaching hospitals have proved unviable in the
National Health Service market.
The government will spend an estimated Pounds 100m on subsidies this
financial year while it tries to achieve the rationalisation recommended in
the Tomlinson report.
St Mary's is a rare example of financial stability - it yesterday reported a
balanced budget for the second year running.
But a government-commissioned review of specialist services published last
month recommended removal of renal transplantation and cardiac services from
the hospital.
This would deprive St Mary's of 10 per cent of its income, and is adding
pressure to the amalgamation bid.
Lord Glenarthur, chairman of the St Mary's Trust, said in his annual report
yesterday that removal of the two services would 'undermine the hospital's
financial soundness'.

FT  23 JUL 93 / Car output at three-year high but commercial sector
depressed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CAR OUTPUT in June was the highest for a single month for nearly three
years, and the highest for the month of June for 19 years, according to
figures published yesterday.
Yet the statistics also underlined that recovery has yet to work its way
into all sectors of commercial vehicle production, where output last month
and in the first half of the year remained sharply below even the severely
depressed levels of last year.
The UK car industry's performance is in stark contrast to that of the main
Continental car-producing countries - Germany, France, Spain and Italy -
where output has been falling by up to 30 per cent since the beginning of
this year.
The statistics, issued jointly by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and
Traders and the Central Statistical Office, also sound a note of caution
about the rate at which the car industry may be able to sustain growth in
output.
Production for export last month slipped below the equivalent period last
year for the second time this year, indicating that the depressed state of
Continental markets - where sales have been falling more sharply than output
 -may soon start to inhibit growth in output.
Last month's 4.3 per cent increase in car output, to 134,753 from 129,203 in
June last year, was to cater almost entirely for the annual surge in sales
in August when the new registration prefix 'L' is introduced.
From a record of just over 500,000 in 1989, August sales fell to 367,000 in
1991 and recovered only marginally to 374,000 last year.
There is growing confidence in the industry that they will rise above the
400,000 thresh-old once again next month.
Total car output for the first half of the year was 742,991, a rise of 8.19
per cent on the 686,747 of the period last year. Output for export over the
period was 7.11 per cent higher at 287,484 from 268,412.
The UK manufacturing plants of Nissan, Toyota and Honda are almost entirely
responsible for the increase in car output. Statistics on output by
manufacturer, also made available yesterday, cover only the first five
months of the year. They show Nissan's output up 43 per cent, to 115,244,
and Toyota and Honda - each in production for the first time this year -
producing 9,727 and 10,886 units respectively.
In the same period Rover Group's output was 3 per cent lower at 163,229,
Ford's 12.3 per cent lower at 131,836 and Vauxhall's 5.2 per cent lower at
111,852.
The depressed state of the commercial vehicle industry is reflected in
first-half output of 105,711 - a drop of 23.91 per cent on the same period
last year.
Export production in the period was 50,419 - a dip of 34.72 per cent on last
year's figure. The fall in June itself was a precipitous 39.2 per cent, to
16,683 from 27,437.
However, both sets of figures reflect the interruption of output caused by
the two-month receivership at van and truck maker Leyland Daf.

FT  23 JUL 93 / People: Batchelor moves into higher gear at Vauxhall
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
After seven years spent as executive director, sales and marketing, of
General Motors' Vauxhall cars subsidiary, the affable Peter Batchelor is
having his responsibilities broadened to embrace all aspects of sales and
after-sales care.
The title of vice chairman, commercial operations, goes with the 55-year-old
Batchelor's new overall responsibility for service, parts and accessories as
well as sales and marketing.
Taking over his old title is Ian Coomber, 48, also no stranger to a Vauxhall
dealer network well pleased with their franchise these days, despite the
relatively poor market.
Both Batchelor and Coomber - the latter until now retail and fleet sales
director - have played significant roles in Vauxhall's rise from a market
share languishing around 8 per cent at the start of the 1980s to more than
double that level now.
Coomber will join Peter Lord, director of after-sales, in reporting directly
to Batchelor.

FT  23 JUL 93 / People: Brown benefits from ABCC's expansion
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The frantic pace of change at the Association of British Chambers of
Commerce over the past three years has put an increasing burden on its small
staff. To keep up with the increased workload the chambers have appointed
their first deputy director general.
Richard Brown, 32, formerly director of policy, has been promoted to handle
the chambers' external affairs and international relations. Recent visitors
to the association's cramped Westminster offices have included chamber
representatives from Russia and Bulgaria and Brown has a busy programme in
Europe over the next few months.
A graduate in French and Spanish from the University of East Anglia, Brown
has been with the chambers for three years. Before that he spent seven years
with the British Institute of Management, ending as director of policy.
Brown will be number two to Ron Taylor, the director general and an old
chambers' hand who has spearheaded the attempts to beef up the British
chamber movement. The association is attempting to create a core network of
some 50 chambers with the resources to match their German and French
counterparts, which enjoy considerable government backing.
In January the association merged with the National Chamber of Trade which
draws its members mainly from the retail sector. This boosted membership
from 90,000 businesses to 214,000. Staff numbers have gone up from 20 to 26
and the association has taken a far more active role in the economic debate.
The result of all this activity has been to give the association a far
stronger role. It was previously seen as a poor relation of some of the
larger local chambers in London, Birmingham and Manchester and was not taken
very seriously.
Brown, who lists his leisure activities as swimming and writing, has just
completed his third book. Due out in October, it is a study of how
implementation of the Maastricht Treaty will affect business. He has been
following the Treaty's tortuous passage with close interest and some
trepidation.

FT  23 JUL 93 / Unemployment to remain problem in Cleveland beyond 2000
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNEMPLOYMENT will remain a significant problem in Cleveland beyond the year
2000, with much of the small amount of anticipated economic growth
concentrated in sectors increasingly reliant on part-time jobs, Chris Tighe
writes.
That is the view of a report considered by county councillors yesterday. It
suggests a further decline in manufacturing employment, and says sustained
economic recovery will reach the area only if it can attract substantial
inward investment.
The research, carried out by council officers and based on 1991 census data,
estimates that the 'jobs gap' - the difference between labour supply and
employment levels - will decrease from 38,800 to 32,400.

FT  23 JUL 93 / Lonrho wins right to sue Fayeds
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
LONRHO, the international trading conglomerate, yesterday won the right to
sue the Fayed brothers for financial loss over an alleged dirty tricks
campaign fought since the brothers gained control of the House of Fraser
stores group.
The Court of Appeal overruled a High Court decision to strike out Lonrho's
claim as 'an abuse of the process of the court'.
But the court refused to reinstate personal damage claims by Mr Tiny Rowland
and Sir Edward du Cann, former Lonrho chairman, which had also been struck
out a year ago.
Lords Justices Dillon, Stuart-Smith and Evans ruled that if they and Lonrho
wanted to claim damages for injury to reputation or feelings they must
launch a separate defamation action.
The feud between the two sides, involving many hard-fought court hearings,
has been going on since 1985 when Mohamed and Ali al-Fayed won control of
the House of Fraser stores group.
Lord Justice Dillon said yesterday that Lonrho had an arguable case that it
suffered financial damage as a result of a 'campaign of vilification'
carried out by a Miss Francesca Pollard, allegedly with the sponsorship and
encouragement of the Fayeds.
The court heard that Miss Pollard claimed that Mr Rowland and others had
cheated her of her Pounds 40m inheritance and pursued a relentless campaign
against him for five years. In 1991 Miss Pollard 'turned her coat' and Mr
Rowland was now supporting her financially.
She was a potential witness for the Lonrho camp and would support the
allegation that she and the Fayeds had conspired to damage Lonrho and its
chief.
The Fayeds will strongly contest the claims.

FT  23 JUL 93 / Insolvency review sparks fears for creditors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT is to review the work of the Insolvency Service in a move
that could lead to the privatisation of part of the Official Receivers'
work.
Such a reform would be the most radical change to insolvency practice in the
UK for nearly a decade. It has caused concern in some quarters because of
fears that the interests of creditors may be adversely affected.
Mr Neil Hamilton, corporate affairs minister, disclosed details of the
review yesterday in a written answer to a parliamentary question.
He said an independent review would 'consider the scope' for 'achieving
better value for money, by making use of the private sector in the work
currently carried out by the Insolvency Service'.
Independent consultants will consider which of the receivers' tasks can be
best carried out in the private sector.
Mr Hamilton said the review would focus on ways in which the Official
Receivers 'can concentrate more on their important investigatory role by
involving the private sector to a larger extent in mechanical processing
work in insolvencies'.
As well as administering and investigating the affairs of bankrupts and
companies in compulsory liquidation, the receivers also report criminal
offences, take disqualification proceedings against unfit directors, and
authorise and regulate insolvency practitioners.
In March 1990 the receivers became an executive agency of the Department of
Trade and Industry, known as the Insolvency Service. Since then its workload
has increased dramatically.
The number of compulsory liquidations of companies in England and Wales has
risen by nearly 200 per cent in five years, from 3,667 in 1988 to 9,734 last
year.
Bankruptcy orders increased from 7,717 to 32,106 over the same period.
Mr Steven Hill, partner with Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the largest insolvency
practice in England and Wales, said: 'The problem, very simply put, is
weight of number of cases.
'The reality is that they can take only quite a small percentage of cases to
investigate further. People are getting away with things.'
Coopers &amp; Lybrand, which obtains a portion of its fees from work stemming
from the Insolvency Service, has chosen not to bid for the work.
Mr Hill said Coopers would study the proposals and would want to be
responsive to the interests of its own clients.
But he was sceptical about the ability of the private sector to improve
matters.
'The Civil Service is doing it at cost. We are doing it for profit. I don't
see how you can square the circle,' he said.
'I'd be concerned on behalf of creditors if the quality of work was diluted
because it was being done by the lowest bidder.'

FT  23 JUL 93 / Thorp testing set to win approval
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Nuclear Fuels is likely to be allowed to start uranium tests on its
Thorp nuclear reprocessing plant at Sellafield in Cumbria within weeks, the
Pollution Inspectorate and the Ministry of Agriculture Fisheries and Food
said yesterday.
In a joint statement, the inspectorate and MAFF said they were 'minded' to
give the go-ahead to the tests 'on or after August 12'. Under the
Radioactive Substances Act 1960 the tests cannot start before local
authorities respond to test permission.
BNF has been waiting since January for a licence to begin operating the
Pounds 2.8bn plant which environmentalists have called the UK's biggest
white elephant.
The inspectorate and MAFF yesterday rejected claims that testing would
prejudice public consultation on the future of Thorp, which is due to start
within weeks and is likely to last until late this year. Greenpeace, the
environmental pressure group, said last night that it was considering a
legal challenge to the decision.
BNF said yesterday that the tests 'would enable BNF to retain up to 700
contract staff who would otherwise have their contracts terminated this
month'.

OUT-OF-COURT settlements of between Pounds 2,000 and Pounds 40,000 for
long-term health problems caused by exposure to carbon monoxide have been
accepted by 28 factory workers.
The case, supported by the TGWU general union, was brought on behalf of the
workers who it was claimed were repeatedly exposed to high concentrations of
carbon monoxide from a leaking factory furnace between 1985 and 1986.
The company, Backer Electric, of Rotherham, South Yorkshire, was then owned
by Hollis Engineering. The company is now owned by a private consortium,
which said yesterday it was not involved in the case.

FT  23 JUL 93 / Fishermen gain legal review of sea days
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FISHERMEN yesterday won the right to a judicial review of government plans
to limit the number of days they can spend at sea each year, Alison Maitland
writes.
The National Federation of Fishermen's Organisations, which says the
legislation would be disastrous for the industry, was given leave to apply
to the High Court for suspension of the rules due to take effect in January.
The hearing is likely to take place in October. Mr David Vaughan QC, counsel
for the federation, which represents 6,000 fishermen in England, Wales,
Northern Ireland and the Channel Islands, said that the measures hit UK
fishermen disproportionately because no similar system was proposed by any
other European Community member state.
The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food told the judge the
fishermen's challenge was 'unfounded' in law.

FT  23 JUL 93 / Shipyard workers win redundancy tax battle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LAW LORDS yesterday ruled that enhanced redundancy payments under Pounds
30,000 cannot be taxed, ending a four-year dispute between the Inland
Revenue and more than 2,000 employees of Harland and Wolff, the Belfast
shipyard.
Lawyers for the company said the Revenue would now have to return Pounds
1.8m to the employees and the company. The Revenue was also ordered to pay
costs.
The case clarifies the position on redundancy payments and has implications
for other sums received by employees as part of their contracts of
employment, said Evershed Wells and Hind, the law firm representing the
Harland and Wolff workers.
Harland and Wolff went into private ownership in 1989 as the result of a
management and employee buy-out. Workers who stayed with the new company
were given a total of Pounds 5.5m by what was then the Department of
Economic Development in return for giving up their entitlement to redundancy
payments above the legal minimum. The money was equivalent to 30 per cent of
the sum the employees would have received under their contracts.
The Revenue argued that while enhanced redundancy payments were taxable in
law, in practice payments under Pounds 30,000 were not taxed. But it refused
to extend this to payments made for giving up enhanced redundancy rights.
The five Law Lords rejected an appeal by the Revenue against an earlier
decision made by the Court of Appeal. The Law Lords found that the payments
were genuinely enhanced redundancy payments and not inducements to join or
stay with the company.
As a result of the ruling, Evershed Wells and Hind said Pounds 1.3m in tax
and national insurance would have to be returned to the shipyard workers and
Pounds 500,000 in employer's national insurance contributions to Harland and
Wolff.
Mr Philip Harrison, an Evershed partner, said the case was an important
legal decision 'which means that redundancy payments under Pounds 30,000
cannot be taxed. It also protects those workers with enhanced redundancy
rights from being taxed should they choose to give up those rights'.
The Revenue said last night that its solicitors would consider the
implications of the judgment.

FT  23 JUL 93 / Nadir friends in protest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RACHEL JOHNSON and RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FRIENDS OF Mr Asil Nadir, the fugitive businessman, have started what
appears to be a concerted campaign against the handling of the case mounted
against him by the Serious Fraud Office.
Within hours of publication by Mr Nadir of a 60-page dossier of court
transcripts and other documents, bound by the UK's strict sub judice laws, a
group of British-based Turkish Cypriots began demonstrating outside Downing
Street.
One demonstrator, Mr Mustafa Gencsoy, chairman of the Turkish Association of
Cyprus, said the 50-strong demonstration yesterday morning was orchestrated
by the All-Turks Legal Support Group.
Mr Gencsoy said Turkish Cypriots were upset by the British authorities'
handling of the case over the past three years and said the evidence
contained in Mr Michael Mates' speech to parliament justified their
feelings.
Mr Mehmet Oguz, a ship engineer who runs the group, said the demonstration
was his idea. 'I feel he's innocent, I want to support him so I called my
friends together.' He denied that there was a link between the release of
the dossier and the gathering.
Scotland Yard said yesterday that three items formerly owned by Mr Nadir
were taken in a burglary on Wednesday from Christie's, the auctioneers, in
central London.

FT  23 JUL 93 / AT&amp;T seeks BT tariff disclosure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AMERICAN Telephone and Telegraph of the US, which is pressing for access to
the UK market, yesterday called for much tougher regulation of British
Telecommunications.
In a submission to the industry regulator Oftel, AT&amp;T said BT should be
forced to publish tariffs for specific services which competitors require to
interconnect with the BT network. BT should also have to publish details of
all relevant costs justifying those tariffs, it said.
This goes far beyond Oftel's draft plans, which would oblige BT to publish
full accounts only for its broad 'retail' and 'network' businesses. AT&amp;T
claimed that 'unbundling' BT's costs for interconnection 'is necessary to
ensure that customers pay only for the services they receive'.
At present competitors have to negotiate the tariff without detailed
knowledge of BT costs. They can appeal to Oftel over unfair treatment.
AT&amp;T, which is awaiting a decision by the Department of Trade and Industry
on its UK move, also criticised BT's control of numbers, directory services
and other structural advantages.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OUT-OF-COURT settlements of between Pounds 2,000 and Pounds 40,000 for
long-term health problems caused by exposure to carbon monoxide gas have
been accepted by 28 factory workers.
Mr John Pickering, of Irwin Mitchell, solicitors for the workers, said he
believed this was the first time compensation had been paid for such a level
of exposure.
The case, supported by the TGWU general union, was brought on behalf of the
workers who it was claimed were repeatedly exposed to high concentrations of
carbon monoxide from a leaking factory furnace between 1985 and 1986.
Symptoms following the exposure included headaches, nausea, aching shoulders
and constant fatigue, according to the solicitors. It said psychological
testing of the affected workers confirmed that many had sustained some
degree of brain damage.
The company, Backer Electric, of Rotherham, South Yorkshire, was then owned
by Hollis Engineering, in turn owned by the late Robert Maxwell.
The company is now owned by a private consortium, which said yesterday it
was not involved in the case.

FT  23 JUL 93 / Life insurance dispute laid to rest by Treasury: A probable
solution to a thorny problem of disclosure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TREASURY has app-arently laid to rest one of the thorniest issues
regulators have had to handle in the seven years since the passage of the
Financial Services Act. What should life insurance companies be required to
tell prospective customers about their products?
Successive regulators, seeking a consensus with the life insurance industry,
failed to devise a regime which would also satisfy consumers and the Office
of Fair Trading. Under the act the OFT is required to decide whether the
disclosure rules are enough to promote true competition in the industry.
In March the OFT ruled that regulators' latest efforts to set disclosure
rules had 'significantly anti-competitive effects' and should be altered.
Those rules allowed companies to present industry-average charges to
prospective customers instead of disclosing their own costs, and only
required them to show the effects of early surrender for the first five
years.
The rules also said that sales agents did not have to tell customers how
much commission they received for each sale, and that all of a single
company's sales agents had to charge customers the same price for the same
products.
The Treasury, which is responsible for overseeing regulation of financial
services, yesterday backed the OFT almost to the hilt and went even further
on the issue of disclosure of commission payments made to sales agents.
Not only should independent financial advisers - who sell the products of
many companies - be required to disclose how much commission they receive
for each sale, but so-called tied and direct sales agents who sell the
products of a single provider should be required to do so as well.
The Treasury has ordered the Securities and Investments Board, the City's
chief regulator, to draft new disclosure rules by the end of the year to put
in place three of the OFT's main recommendations. On commission disclosure,
the SIB is to come up with recommendations on how to calculate payments to
sales agents by the same time.
The other main points of the Treasury ruling are:
Life insurance companies are to clearly disclose the surrender value of
policies in each of the first five years. For later years they are to give
enough information about the value of a policy surrendered before maturity
without appearing to guarantee a sum which cannot be counted on. The SIB had
proposed showing surrender values only up to the fifth year of the policy.
Companies must tell prospective customers by how much their own charges will
reduce the projected investment returns of any given policy. The SIB had
proposed allowing companies to show industry-wide average charges.
Lower-cost sales outlets, such as large chains of building societies, should
be allowed to charge less for the products they sell. This is intended to
help customers choose lower-cost outlets and reward efficient sales agents.
Mr Anthony Nelson, Treasury economics secretary, said he expected the rules
on commission disclosure to result in lower commission payments overall.
'Because of the size of commissions and the scope this gives for bias in
advice we feel the need for commission disclosure is great,' he said.
Since the OFT made its recommendations in March the Treasury has been
subject to intensive lobbying by the insurance industry, supported by its
self-regulating bodies.
Mr Nelson said he was mindful of the potential commercial effects the new
rules could have on the industry. 'I have no reason to believe that life
products which have offered good benefits and mutual value will not continue
to be sold,' he said.
'But if the new rules lead to changes in the industry, it is only responding
to consumer choice,' he added.

FT  23 JUL 93 / Press and lottery bills are delayed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE National Heritage Department has failed to complete work on two of its
main policy initiatives - regulation of the press and the completion of the
National Lottery Bill - before the summer parliamentary recess.
Mr Peter Brooke, National Heritage secretary, yesterday told Mr Gerald
Kaufman - chairman of the heritage select committee which looked into the
press and privacy - that the planned white paper on the press would not be
published before parliament rises for the summer, as had been expected. Work
on the complex issues involved is not complete and the white paper will be
published during the recess.
The document is expected to advocate the creation of an ombudsman for the
press in addition to the Press Complaints Commission, the body set up by the
newspaper industry to adjudicate on complaints.
Mr Brooke also wants the newspaper industry to agree voluntarily that the
ombudsman should have the right to fine newspapers for misbehaviour. This
proposal is likely to be vigorously opposed by the newspaper industry.
Hopes that the National Lottery Bill would receive royal assent before the
Commons rises have been abandoned largely because of the pressure on
parliamentary time caused by debate on the Maastricht treaty.
The lottery bill will complete its passage through the House of Lords, but
its final Commons stages will not take place until October. The delay will
disappoint the consortia interested in applying for the licence to run the
lottery, which could have revenues of between Pounds 3bn and Pounds 5bn a
year.
The National Heritage Department believes that the first Pounds 1m prize
draw could still take place on schedule in late 1994 or early 1995.
Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, is to meet chief police officers to
discuss the radical proposals on pay and conditions in the Sheehy report.
Sheehy proposes fixed-term appointments, performance-related pay and changes
in pension rights, allowances and rank structure.
The three staff associations representing all ranks will hold meetings with
senior Home Office officials over the next three days to try to find common
ground.

THE OFFICE of Fair Trading has decided not to act against insurance
companies over their practice of recommending repairers and glass fitters to
motorists covered by their policies. The OFT has called, however, for
consumers to be made more aware of their rights.
Insurance companies recommend repair companies which may work on damaged
cars without further authorisation. Body shops and glass fitters which are
not participants have complained that consumers might assume they were
required to employ a recommended repairer. The OFT concluded insurers were
encouraging claimants to employ recommended companies.

<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT should reconsider plans to deregulate London's buses if they
mean abandoning the travelcard season ticket, MPs warned yesterday, Richard
Tomkins writes.
The Commons transport committee said loss of the travelcard, or similar
concessions, would be 'too high a price to pay for the speculative benefits
of deregulation'.
Deregulating the bus market in London would bring the capital in line with
the rest of the country, where operators have been free to run any services
they choose since 1986.
Ministers are expected to bring forward legislation for deregulation in the
next session of parliament.
The government yesterday said the Yorkshire Traction Bus Company could take
over Lincoln City Transport without reference to the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission.

FT  23 JUL 93 / Proportion of 'very satisfied' bank customers halved in 10
years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE proportion of customers who are very satisfied with the service they
receive from their banks has nearly halved in the past decade, according to
a poll carried out for the National Consumer Council.
The poll, commissioned for its submission to the committee reviewing the
banking code of practice, found that the proportion of 'very satisfied'
customers has fallen from 62 per cent in 1983 to 34 per cent this year.
Although the proportion of fairly satisfied customers rose from 30 per cent
to 52 per cent, this means that the overall figure for fairly or very
satisfied customers has dropped by 6 per cent to 86 per cent.
The poll, carried out by the MORI research organisation, found that 20 per
cent of customers had experienced a problem in the previous 12 months such
as an error in a bank statement, or standing order.
Some 10 per cent said they had experienced a problem with a cash dispensing
machine that was not their fault. Those with an income of more than Pounds
25,000 were more likely to report a bank error.
The highest proportion of errors among the 1,570 current account customers
surveyed was among those aged 35 to 44, of whom 31 per cent had experienced
a problem. By contrast, only 16 per cent of those aged 55 to 64 reported a
problem.
Lady Wilcox, council chairman, said the code of practice was flawed because
banks were not required to give prior notification of charges, controls on
confidential information were too vague, and there was little guidance on
complaints procedures.
The council recommends that the committee reviewing the code - which was
introduced in March last year - should tighten up banks' compliance and
response to complaints.
It recommends that customers' express consent should be sought before names
are used for marketing purposes. This consent should be sought when
customers open accounts, and at regular intervals after that.

FT  23 JUL 93 / Ambition trips up holiday companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OVER-AMBITIOUS expansion resulted in the collapse last year of 24 providers
of flight-based package holidays - the highest number on record - says the
accounts of the Air Travel Trust Fund, published yesterday.
The accounts show that operators expanded their programmes last year, but
demand failed to match expectations.
The Civil Aviation Authority, which administers the fund, said it had to
arrange the return to the UK of 30,416 holidaymakers after company failures
in the year to March 31. More than half those were customers of Airbreak,
which collapsed last September. The cost of repatriations was Pounds 5.6m.
The authority also had to arrange refunds to 127,910 customers of failed
companies, at a cost of Pounds 12.96m. Nearly half of those who received
refunds were customers of Riva, which failed last February. Riva was set up
by former executives of the International Leisure Group, which collapsed in
1991.
Of the Pounds 18.6m total spent on repatriation and refunds, just less than
Pounds 6m was paid by the trust fund. The fund makes up the shortfall where
the company's bond proves insufficient.
The biggest call on the fund came from Sungate Travel, which collapsed last

FT  23 JUL 93 / M25 widening proposed: 14-lane plan for busiest stretch of
motorway near Heathrow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BUSIEST stretch of the M25 motorway, the London orbital which is
Britain's busiest road, will be widened to 14 lanes under a Pounds 241m
package of proposals announced yesterday.
Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, predicted that there would be 'no
congestion' on the motorway near Heathrow airport 'and no diversion on to
local roads' if the plans were accepted.
The M25 has been plagued by traffic jams since it was opened in 1986, with
traffic volumes far higher than originally predicted. A quarter of its
traffic is freight.
Industrialists and road user groups welcomed the proposals, but
environmentalists attacked them, arguing that they would increase traffic
levels.
Mr Stephen Joseph, director of environmental campaign group Transport 2000,
said: 'The proposals ignore the potential for alternatives such as the
Crossrail and Thameslink 2000 rail schemes.'
Mr MacGregor said: 'Doing nothing is not an option.' He stressed that 70 per
cent of the M25 would not be widened beyond four lanes, a prediction he said
held 'for 20 to 25 years'.
Department of Transport officials said the schemes were not intended to make
the M25 'into some Los Angeles-style highway'.
Yesterday's proposals take the total cost of widening the M25 to about
Pounds 1bn, Mr MacGregor said.
That includes widening the road from three lanes to four all the way around,
part of the 1989 road white paper's plans.
The most controversial of the proposals is the construction of three-lane
'link roads' along the shoulder of the motorway between junctions 12 and 15
near Heathrow, at a cost of Pounds 144m. These would run parallel to the M25
and allow motorists to travel along the same route as the motorway without
joining it.
The transport department said 'almost all' of the 12,000 responses to its
public consultation had objected to the plans. However, vehicles crawled at
'stop-start' speed on this section for an hour a day, Mr MacGregor said, and
this would rise to two hours a day within five years.
The plans will go to a public inquiry, due to start next year.

FT  23 JUL 93 / Extra London runway may be delayed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM KING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A NEW runway to relieve congestion at London's airports might not be needed
until 2015, 10 years later than previously thought, says a
government-appointed working party.
In a report published yesterday, the working party - made up of
representatives from the government, the aviation industry, local
authorities and environmental groups - substantially changed previous
estimates of the capacity of the south-east's runways.
In 1990 the Civil Aviation Authority predicted that another runway would be
needed by 2005. Yesterday's report said there would be a case for a further
runway at either Heathrow or Gatwick by 2010 or, if this were not provided,
at Stansted by 2015.
Even without the construction of more runways, it estimated that the main
south-east airports could handle a maximum of 170m passengers a year by
2015. Last year 69m passengers used the airports.
BAA, which owns and runs the three London airports, said the report showed
runway capacity was not the immediate issue. Sir John Egan, chief executive,
said its priority was to build Terminal Five at Heathrow to make 'full use
of the existing runways'.
But British Airways argued that a third runway at Heathrow would best meet
the needs of passengers.
The working party said only the four main south-east airports - Heathrow,
Gatwick, Stansted and Luton - offered worthwhile prospects for accommodating
a new runway, though it acknowledged that expansion of regional airports
would help meet growth in passenger demand. It said a new runway would add
at least 40m passengers a year to capacity, while extending the runway at
Luton would add 10m.
Department of Transport sources admitted that any decision would be highly
charged politically.
The report said a new runway at Heathrow would provide the greatest benefits
to the air transport industry and passengers, but would have the greatest
disadvantages in terms of noise, demolition of homes and land use.
Gatwick is judged to have a high level of benefits but would also be faced
with substantial environmental problems. Stansted has lower benefits but
similar environmental problems to Gatwick. Extending at Luton would merely
delay a decision on expansion elsewhere by three years.
The report sets out detailed development options for runways at each
airport, and estimates that 3,300 homes would have to demolished if the new
runway was built at Heathrow, 100 at Gatwick and 80 at Stansted.

Even before the M25 was fully open in 1986, its traffic jams had become the
butt of comedians. The busiest sections, near Heathrow, between junctions 12
and 16, carry up to 200,000 vehicles a day; each section was intended to
take 80,000. Proposals put forward are:
To build three-lane link roads alongside the present four-lane motor way
between Junctions 12 and 15. To build two-lane link roads between junctions
15 and 16 near the M40 at a cost of Pounds 52m. A public consultation was
announced yesterday.
To widen the existing three-lane motorway between junctions 7 and 8 and
junctions 10 and 11 to four lanes, as part of plans to widen the whole
motorway to four lanes in each direction announced in the 1989 roads white

FT  23 JUL 93 / Uranium testing at Thorp likely to be approved
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Nuclear Fuels is likely to be allowed to start uranium tests on its
Thorp nuclear reprocessing plant at Sellafield in Cumbria within weeks, the
Pollution Inspectorate and the Ministry of Agriculture Fisheries and Food
said yesterday.
In a joint statement, the inspectorate and MAFF said they were 'minded' to
give the go-ahead to the tests 'on or after August 12'. Under the 1960
Radioactive Substances Act 1960 the tests cannot start before local
authorities respond to test permission.
BNF has been waiting since January for a licence to begin operating the
Pounds 2.8bn plant which environmentalists have called the UK's biggest
white elephant.
The Inspectorate and MAFF yesterday rejected claims that testing would
prejudice public consultation on the future of Thorp, which is due to start
within weeks and is likely to last until late this year. Greenpeace, the
environmental pressure group, said last night that it was considering a
legal challenge to the decision.
BNF wants to test the plant with radioactive material to determine any
technical problems. It said testing would save at least two months'
preparation and between Pounds 20m and Pounds 30m if it finally obtains a
licence for full operation. BNF added that the tests 'would enable BNF to
retain up to 700 contract staff who would otherwise have their contracts
terminated this month'.
The inspectorate and MAFF said BNF had 'indicated that it would be possible
to decontaminate the plant (after testing) for the relatively small sum of
Pounds 250,000 should permission for reprocessing not be given'.
They said they would be likely to authorise testing because 'the
radiological impact would be very small, less than 0.001 per cent of the
average dose to the UK population from natural background radiation'.
They added that emissions during testing would be far lower than those
during full operation, and it had already been determined that the impact of
full operation on human health and the environment would be 'acceptable'.

FT  23 JUL 93 / Holiday company failures due to growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OVER-AMBITIOUS expansion resulted in the collapse last year of 24 providers
of flight-based package holidays - the highest number on record - say the
accounts of the Air Travel Trust Fund, published yesterday.
The Civil Aviation Authority, which administers the fund, said it had to
arrange the return to the UK of 30,416 holidaymakers whose companies had
failed in the year to March 31. The cost of repatriation was Pounds 5.6m.
More than half those repatriated were customers of Airbreak, which collapsed
last September.
The authority also had to arrange refunds to 127,910 customers of failed
companies, at a cost of Pounds 12.96m. Nearly half of those who received
refunds were customers of Riva, which failed last February. Riva was set up
by former executives of the International Leisure Group, which collapsed in
1991.
Of the Pounds 18.6m total spent on repatriation and refunds, just under
Pounds 6m was paid by the trust fund. The fund makes up the shortfall where
the failed company's bond proves insufficient.
The biggest call on the fund came from Sungate Travel, which collapsed last
March. Sungate's bond fell Pounds 1.7m short of what was needed to
compensate customers. Airbreak's failure resulted in the fund paying out
Pounds 1.3m, while the cost to it of the Riva failure was Pounds 1m.
The authority said the size of the call on the fund was increased because of
the unusually high proportion of failures during the July to September
period. Failures during the peak season are more costly because of the high
numbers of people already abroad who require repatriation and because many
who have not yet left have paid for their holidays in full.
Operators expanded their programmes last year, but demand failed to match
expectations.

Even before the M25 was fully opened in 1986, its traffic jams had become
the butt of standup comedians. The busiest sections near Heathrow in the
west, between junctions 12 and 16, carry up to 200,000 vehicles a day,
although each section was intended to take 80,000.
Proposals put forward yesterday are:
To build three-lane link roads along each side of the present four-lane
motorway between Junctions 12 and 15 near Heathrow Airport and Staines, at a
cost of Pounds 144m. A public inquiry starts next summer and the roads could
be built by the end of the 1990s.
To build two-lane link roads between junctions 15 and 16 near the M40 at a
cost of Pounds 52m. A public consultation was announced yesterday.
To widen the existing three-lane motorway between junctions 7 and 8 and

The total of all improvements planned, including expanding the whole orbit
to four lanes, is expected to be about Pounds 1bn, the Department of
Transport said yesterday.

FT  23 JUL 93 / Insurers spared OFT action
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE OFFICE of Fair Trading has decided not to act against insurance
companies over their practice of recommending repairers and glass fitters to
motorists covered by their policies. The OFT has called, however, for
consumers to be made more aware of their rights.
Insurance companies recommend repair companies which may begin work on
damaged cars without further authorisation. Body shops and glass fitters
which are not participants have complained that consumers might assume that
they were required to employ a recommended repairer or fitter. They have
also complained that criteria for recommendation were unduly restrictive.
The OFT concluded that insurers were encouraging claimants to employ
recommended companies. In the case of glass replacement, insurers limit
their liability or impose an excess charge if the work is carried out by a
non-recommended fitter. For body repairs, advice given by insurers might
sometimes exaggerate the inconvenience and delay of employing a
non-recommended company.
Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of fair trading, said much of the
perceived unfairness of these schemes could 'be traced to imperfect
understanding of their rights by consumers'. The OFT is to discuss with the
insurance industry ways of improving awareness of rights.

FT  23 JUL 93 / National Power justifies role in pool price rises
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NATIONAL POWER, the UK's largest electricity generator, said yesterday that
it used its market power in a 'transparent and principled way' in an attempt
to minimise the chances of a referral to the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission over recent rises in electricity prices for large customers.
The company said its bidding practices in the electricity wholesale pool
were fully justified and the current pool price was not excessive.
Prof Stephen Littlechild, industry regulator, asked National Power and other
companies including PowerGen and the National Grid for explanations after
pool prices rose 10 per cent in April.
He subsequently warned that he would refer the generators to the commission
if he was not satisfied with their responses. He is due to publish his views
in the next two weeks.
Some analysts believe a reference is increasingly likely by 1995, if not
over pool price rises then over an issue such as the generators' costs and
margins.
Most consumers have been unaffected by the pool price changes because of
fixed-price contracts between generators and suppliers. It is the large
industrial users, who buy directly from the pool, who have been hit hard.
National Power said yesterday that it told the regulator that pool prices
alone, uncovered by fixed-price contracts, would have provided an inadequate
income in the first three years after privatisation. Pool prices were
artificially low because of surplus capacity.
If current prices were maintained this year, pool revenue would cover cash
operating costs and make some contribution to capital investments and debt
and equity servicing costs, National Power said. But its bid prices more
realistically reflected the cost of electricity production.
It added that increases in uplift charges, a mark-up added to the pool price
to pay for administrative costs of the pool, resulted from reinforcement
work being carried out on the national grid.
National Power said it had priced its bids to 'recover our losses but no
more' when power stations were put out of action by the work on the grid.
Sharp upward price movements in the pool appeared to be caused by the
scheduling and price setting mechanism, National Power said.

FT  23 JUL 93 / The Maastricht Vote: Defeated PM says issue must not
'fester'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major's announcement to the Commons after the government was
defeated:
'The House has not come to a resolution as required under section seven of
the European Communities (Amendment) Act and so the act cannot come into
force. We clearly cannot leave the matter there.
'Tonight's debate has shown that there is no majority in this House for the
UK to join the social chapter. There is however, as we know, a majority of
this House in favour of ratifying the Maastricht treaty.
'I therefore invite the opposition parties who say they support ratification
and respect the opinion of this House to reconsider their position.
'We must resolve this issue and it cannot be permitted to fester any longer.
'I therefore give notice that the government will invite the House to come
to a resolution tomorrow in support of the government's policy on the social
chapter by putting down a motion of confidence in the following terms: 'That
this House has confidence in the policy of Her Majesty's government on the
adoption of the protocol on social policy.''
Mr John Smith's reply to Mr Major:
'On a point of order, Madam Speaker, the prime minister may seek to maintain
that there was no vote in the House for the social chapter. There was not
vote against it. The plain fact is that the House tied.
'There will therefore be, when the resolution is posed, - and I notice the
prime minister has been driven to use the confidence factor because he
cannot win the vote on any other basis - but when he tables his resolution,
we on this side will table an amendment that will give a tied House of
Commons the opportunity to vote positively for the social chapter tomorrow.'

FT  23 JUL 93 / The Maastricht Vote: Election threatened if confidence vote
is lost
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH and MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TODAY'S Commons debate offers a second day of almost unprecedented drama at
Westminster.
The voting pattern will follow that of yesterday with an opposition
amendment being taken first and a vote on a government motion taken
afterwards. But this time it really matters.
Mr John Major cannot expect to remain as prime minister if he loses, and
probably the Conservative party would find it exceedingly difficult to
remain in government.
At Westminster ministers and backbenchers were clear that a defeat for the
government today would mean a general election.
Even so, Tory MPs reckoned that there would still be a couple of Euro-rebels
who would vote against the motion expressing confidence in the government
and its policy on the social chapter.
'They would have to be seriously mad,' one minister commented, before going
on to list one or two who might come into that category.
A cabinet minister put the question starkly: 'People have got to make their
minds up. Anyone who votes against the government on a question of
confidence loses the party whip and would be unable to stand as an official
candidate.'
Ministers emphasised that if there were a general election as a result of
the government having lost the vote, then the rebels could have to face up
to having allowed in a Labour or Labour-Liberal Democrat coalition
government which would ratify Maastricht with the social chapter.
One said: 'The only possible choice for the rebels now is whether they want
the Maastricht treaty with the social chapter, or without it. That is the
only choice.'
The events yesterday already set new patterns. The use of the casting vote
by the Speaker - which was basically in favour of the government - will be
debated for years to come. In announcing her vote, Miss Betty Boothroyd said
that she was acting in accordance with precedent, since it was not the task
of the Speaker to create a majority in the Commons on a policy issue.
Others might argue, however, about whether she was constitutionally correct.
She could have decided that the government had lost control and therefore
given her support to the opposition forces. In the case of another tie
today, she could choose to go the other way.
As it was, the Tory rebels came to the fore in refusing to support the
government's own motion. They are unlikely to do so in such numbers today,
though some remain defiant. Even with pressure mounting, one rebel said:
'I'll have to sleep on it.'
A few rebels also insist that since the motion refers to the social chapter
it is not a pure confidence motion.
Though Labour now assumes that the prime minister cannot survive, ministers
fiercely rejected the idea that this was about Mr Major himself. They argued
that it was a question of confidence in the government as a whole and in its
policy.
'The idea that we change the prime minister and the Conservative party stays
in office is strictly for the birds,' said one senior minister.
Ministers said that the issue now had to be an issue of confidence in order
to prevent repeated blocking of ratification on the technicality of coming
to a Commons resolution. 'It's the classic way of handling a defeat on a
serious issue,' said one.
And if there was an election? 'Anyone with a majority of 10,000 would not be
back,' was the verdict of one seasoned MP with a majority comfortably above
that.
It was also a vote where abstentions spoke as loudly as votes. The aggregate
vote on the opposition amendment yesterday was 634. On the government motion
it was 640.
The very fact that the vote is taking place on a Friday, within hours of the
upsets, is a sign of the seriousness of the circumstances.
Post-war British governments have been in deep trouble before: Harold
Macmillan's administration over Suez and Sir Edward Heath's over the miners,
but never was there a suggestion that either would fall. The last government
to lose a confidence motion was that of James Callaghan in 1979: it happened
because deals with minority parties failed to work on the night.

FT  23 JUL 93 / The Maastricht Vote: Unionist deal turns on 'accountable
democracy' for Ulster
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CRUX of the understanding reached last night between the Ulster Unionist
party and the government was an apparently vague commitment to restore
accountable democracy to Northern Ireland.
But the party's MPs made clear that they expected concessions to flow over
the next few weeks, after they supported the government in both of last
night's votes.
The party's nine MPs said they looked to the government 'to fulfil its
pledges and restore accountable democracy to the people of Northern
Ireland'. There were no specific concessions announced and government
ministers said none had been offered.
The deal appeared to fall well short of expectations. It was thought that a
Northern Ireland select committee was regarded as the absolute minimum that
Mr James Molyneaux, the party leader, would demand.
But Mr Molyneaux, a canny Westminster operator who has shunned publicity
this week, seems to have tried to take a longer-term view and to hammer home
to the government how it must now always bear in mind the views of the
Ulster Unionist party. The message last night was that Northern Ireland's
place in the UK had to be reinforced.
With the Irish government anxious that Britain should balance the demands of
Unionists and nationalists in the province, Anglo-Irish relations will only
be undermined.
Steps had also been taken to give locally elected representatives real power
 -rather than the present system of direct rule from Westminster, the Ulster
Unionist MPs said. A Northern Ireland select committee in the Commons looked
set to be the first result of the deal.
More broadly, the Ulster Unionists seem to have decided that their interests
lay in helping the Conservatives, rather than the Labour party. They have
been encouraged by Mr Major's recent attacks on Labour's ideas for joint
Anglo-Irish sovereignty for the province - and clashes between London and
Dublin on similar proposals.
The Ulster Unionists were clear last night that they will support the
government in today's confidence motion. The appointment of Mr Kevin
McNamara, Labour's nationalist Northern Ireland spokesman, as secretary of
state, holds far more horrors for Unionists than Maastricht's eventual
ratifi-cation.
The Irish government last night reserved comment on the apparent deal, but
ministers in Dublin were known to be concerned about the implications of the
accord and its consequences for continuing efforts to restore an
inter-party, cross-Irish border political dialogue on the future of Northern
Ireland.
Official sources in the Irish capital said urgent efforts would be made to
discover the details of any pact made, or assurances received by the
Unionists.

FT  23 JUL 93 / The Maastricht Vote: Opposition parties exploit government's
discomfort
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE opposition subjected the prime minister to a barrage of taunts and
insults in the Commons last night after the government's failure to vote
down the social chapter of the Maastricht treaty.
Mr John Major's decision to resort to a confidence motion today to try to
rescue the government from its crisis was scornfully derided by Mr John
Smith, Labour leader.
To cheers from packed Labour benches Mr Smith scoffed that the prime
minister had been driven to use the confidence factor because 'he cannot win
a vote on anything else'. He announced that Labour would table an amendment
to the motion to give the House the opportunity to 'vote positively' for the
social chapter.
Further cheers rang across the opposition benches when Sir Russell Johnston,
for the Liberal Democrats, attacked the government for doing a deal with the
Ulster Unionists to avoid defeat on the Labour amendment backing the
chapter.
He said ministers had been willing to 'strengthen sectarian politics in
Northern Ireland' to deny workers their rights throughout the UK.
Mr Tony Benn (Lab Chesterfield) urged Miss Betty Boothroyd, the Speaker, to
consider whether,in light of the government's failure to secure a majority,
it would be acting contrary to the Bill of Rights if it were to use the
royal prerogative to ratify the Maastricht treaty.
He claimed that there was no provision in the European Communities
(Amendment) Act - the official title of the Maastricht bill - enabling the
House to reverse an earlier decision.
Earlier, Mr Smith had warned Mr Major that if he sought to defy the will of
the house over Maastricht he would have 'exceeded the power of his office'.
Calling on MPs to support the social provisions of the treaty, Mr Smith
claimed that the debate was more about the 'tattered reputation of a
discredited prime minister' than the national interest.
This theme was taken up by Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader, who
told Mr Major that if the vote went against the government 'we expect him to
obey it'.
To Labour cheers Mr Smith insisted that Britain had no future as the
'sweatshop of Europe', and forecast accelerating economic decline if the
policies of social devaluation which lay behind the attempt to opt out from
the social chapter continued. Mr Smith said Britain was alone among the 12
member states of the European Community in opposing a modest extension of
its competence to such matters as the protection of health and safety of
people at work.
He accused the prime minister of increasingly inhabiting a 'Walter Mitty
world' in which he alone suffered from the delusion that getting Britain
excluded from a decision-making process of considerable consequence
constituted a triumph.

FT  23 JUL 93 / The Maastricht Vote: Leading bankers tell Major adopting the
social chapter would be 'a serious mistake'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
LEADING bankers yesterday told Mr John Major that it would be 'a serious
mistake' for Britain to adopt the social chapter.
In a fax to Downing Street they told the prime minister: 'We are concerned
about attempts being made to graft the social chapter on to our obligations.
We think this would be a serious mistake.
'It is vital for all of us in this country to play our full part in
influencing the future development of Europe, but we in the City also have
the greatest interest in the competitiveness of British business and
industry.
'We consider that the social chapter would damage this competitiveness. Its
aims are far best considered and decided on by individual countries. For the
European Commission to do so would be a recipe for inflexibility and for a
higher regulatory burden.'
Those who signed it are: Lord Alexander of Weedon (National Westminster); Mr
Andrew Buxton (Barclays); Sir Nicholas Goodison (TSB); Sir Robin Ibbs
(Lloyds); Mr Bruce Pattullo (Bank of Scotland); Lord Stewartby (Standard
Chartered); Sir Christopher Tugendhat (Abbey National); Sir Peter Walters
(Midland) and Lord Younger of Prestwick (Royal Bank of Scotland).

FT  23 JUL 93 / The Maastricht Vote: MPs who decided to defy the whips
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE were angry scenes last night in the division lobbies as tempers frayed
in a tense House of Commons.
At one point the count was stopped because of a dispute over whether an MP
was entitled to vote or not.
Tory Euro-rebels complained about government 'strong-arm tactics', with one
claiming that a Tory whip tried literally to pull a dissident to support Mr
Major.
Mr John Wilkinson said: 'There was an attempt by the deputy chief whip to
pull, physically, Bill Walker (MP for Tayside North) with whom I was walking
out of the lobby. Bill Walker has been a very sick man. He very bravely
travelled to London to cast his vote and I thought it was disgraceful
behaviour.'
A total of 15 Tory rebels joined the opposition ranks in this first vote
which was announced as tied 317-317. Miss Betty Boothroyd, the Speaker, then
cast her vote for the government.
They were: Sir Richard Body (Holland with Boston), John Butcher (Coventry
South West), Bill Cash (Stafford), Teresa Gorman (Billericay), Toby Jessel
(Twickenham), Edward Leigh (Gainsborough and Horncastle), Tony Marlow
(Northampton North), Richard Shepherd (Aldridge-Brownhills), Sir Trevor
Skeet (Bedfordshire North), Walter Sweeney (Vale of Glamorgan), Sir Peter
Tapsell (Lindsey East), Sir Teddy Taylor (Southend East), Bill Walker
(Tayside North), John Wilkinson (Ruislip Northwood) and Ann Winterton
(Congleton).
A further eight Conservatives did not vote. They were: Rupert Allason
(Torbay), Nicholas Budgen (Wolverhampton South West), Sir George Gardiner
(Reigate), Christopher Gill (Ludlow), Warren Hawksley (Halesowen and
Stourbridge), Sir Ivan Lawrence (Burton), Barry Legg (Milton Keynes South
West) and Michael Spicer (Worcestershire South).
The vote for the Labour amendment was made up as follows: Labour 267,
Liberal Democrats 21, Conservative 15, Plaid Cymru 4, SDLP 4, Democratic
Unionists 3, and Scottish National Party 3. The following voted against the
amendment: Conservative 307, Ulster Unionist 9, Popular Unionist 1.
On the second vote, MPs rejected the government's motion by 324 votes to
316.
This time the number of Tory rebels rose to 23. The previous 15 were joined
by: Nicholas Budgen, James Cran (Beverley), Iain Duncan-Smith (Chingford),
Sir George Gardiner, Christopher Gill, Sir Ivan Lawrence, Barry Legg, and
Michael Spicer. One Tory and one Democratic Unionist did not vote. They were
Rupert Allason and Rev William McCrea (DUP Mid Ulster).

FT  23 JUL 93 / The Maastricht Vote: Lawmaker and courts rejoin ancient
battle - Gillian Tett analyses the latest skirmish in Lord Rees-Mogg's legal
campaign
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN Miss Betty Boothroyd, the Speaker of the House of Commons, warned the
courts this week against trespassing on parliamentary rights, she was
following in a long tradition. British political life has long been
dominated by battles between those who make the laws and those who seek to
apply them.
Professor Trevor Hartley of the London School of Economics said: 'Usually
they take care to keep off each other's territory. But there is a tradition
going back to the last century of clashes between the courts and
parliament.'
In spite of the historical precedent, the legal status of Mrs Boothroyd's
attack seems questionable - not least because Lord Rees-Mogg's case, now
going through the courts, is primarily directed against the government
rather than parliament. Lord Rees-Mogg's reasoning could be interpreted as
an argument that parliament should enjoy stronger powers.
In theory, the relationship between parliament and the law courts is
relatively clear-cut. Parliament's role, under British political tradition,
is to create legislation; the courts are there to interpret and apply it.
This means, as the Speaker pointed out, that the courts have no right to
legislate over parliament - unlike in Germany, for example, where the courts
have a constitutional right to restrain the executive.
But British law is based on a mixture of statute and precedent. a court
ruling contributes to the definition of the law, not least because a ruling
is binding on lower courts.
In recent years this has led to accusations that the role of the Law Lords
has been expanding so that they are almost creating legislation.
But although parliament's unique right to legislate would seem to give the
House of Commons moral weight on a matter like the Maastricht bill, the
validity of Miss Boothroyd's attack in the Rees-Mogg case would seem
doubtful.
A problem with Miss Boothroyd's reasoning, says Mr Paul Craig of Oxford
University, is her use of article nine from the 1689 Bill of Rights, which
declares: 'The freedom of speech and debates or proceedings in parliament
ought not to be impeached or questioned in any court or place out of
parliament.'
She appeared to be suggesting that the courts did not have the right to
challenge parliament's right to ratify the Maastricht treaty. But, as Mr
Craig yesterday pointed out, article nine has usually been understood to
have two different implications - first, to ensure that parliamentary debate
enjoyed protection from court action; and, secondly, to ensure the courts
could not interfere in internal parliamentary proceedings.
In theory, the Commons could use the second of these arguments to argue
against a judicial review, but in practice the courts have long seen it as
part of their role to examine the validity and working of parliamentary
acts.
As Mr Craig pointed out, it is not only the Commons that can use the moral
weight of article nine - since the bill has long been law, the courts have
the right to interpret and apply it. If the House wishes to ensure that its
relationship with the courts is clarified further, it may have to start
again - and draft a new law.

FT  23 JUL 93 / The Maastricht Vote: EC partners are confused over
Westminster wrangle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Political Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE WAS confusion among Britain's European Community partners last night
over the complexities of the Westminster battle over the Maastricht treaty.
There was no comment from the Brussels headquarters of the EC Commission. Mr
Jacques Delors, Commission president, had told officials to say nothing
which could prejudice the chances of a deal to complete the treaty's passage
through the Commons.
But the vote served to renew worries in the rest of the EC about Britain's
commitment to the community.
The UK's embassy to the EC said it had had many calls from journalists
seeking explanations about the domestic politics involved in ratifying the
treaty. An official said: 'We are finding it difficult to put it across in a
way which is immediately accessible.'
Mr Leo Tindemanns, former Belgium foreign minister, was 'sad' at last
night's outcome. He said the rebellion in the government ranks 'looks from
Brussels like an attempt to commit suicide by the Conservative party'.
Mr Major's decision to put the government's future on the line over
Maastricht with a confidence vote did win approval from one EC official, who
said: 'He is putting his money where his mouth is. He is showing that he is
prepared to stake his government on a European issue of fundamental
importance.'
Lord Rees-Mogg, who is challenging ratification of the Maastricht treaty in
the High Court, said his case had been strengthened by events in the
Commons. Speaking on BBC2's Newsnight programme, he said: 'This great
parliamentary confusion seems to me to arise basically because the
government didn't decide right from the beginning that a referendum was
necessary for so great a constitutional change.'

FT  23 JUL 93 / The Maastricht Vote: Tory loyalists rally behind Major
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TORY loyalists cheered Mr John Major when he announced that he would seek a
vote of confidence today to rescue the government from the wreckage of its
policy over ratification of the Maastricht treaty.
The prime minister, ignoring Labour shouts of 'resign', claimed that the
tied vote had shown that there was no majority in the Commons for the UK to
join the social chapter.
He insisted that earlier votes had shown that there was majority in favour
of ratifying the Maastricht treaty.
There were angry shouts of 'no' from the Labour benches when he invited the
opposition parties to reconsider the position they had adopted in respect of
the social chapter and reaffirm their earlier declarations of support for
the treaty.
Mr Major declared: 'In any case we must resolve this issue. It cannot be
permitted to fester any longer.'
When he opened the debate Mr Major delivered an impassioned warning that
unless the UK honoured its obligations it would lose its growing influence
within the European Community.
He made what proved to be a largely ineffective appeal to Tory rebels to
think again before joining opposition parties in a 'cynical' vote for the
social chapter.
He was particularly vitriolic about the Liberal Democrats, describing their
tactics as 'frankly contemptible' given the party's pro-European stance.
His attack incensed Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader, who insisted
that voting against the government amounted to support for the social
chapter.
The electric atmosphere in the packed Commons chamber alternated between
uproar and rapt silence as Mr Major said that the true will of parliament
had been expressed by the 71 previous votes in favour of the Maastricht act.
They 'should not be frustrated by one parliamentary motion'.
If there were a free-standing debate on the social chapter, he asserted, MPs
would reject it. He had been acting 'within the remit of parliament' when he
negotiated the treaty, including the opt-out from the social chapter.
Insisting that the UK would ratify the treaty, Mr Major made it clear that
the Tory Euro-sceptics were wrong to have convinced themselves that voting
with Labour would prevent ratification.
The alliance lined up against the government was 'not based on any
conviction whatsoever'. A vote cast with the aim of preventing ratification
of the treaty would be 'a cynical and disreputable vote'.
Two former rebels intervened in the prime minister's speech to announce that
they would vote with the government. 'I am always delighted to accept a
sinner returning home,' Mr Major replied.
He later earned a standing ovation from a private meeting of Tory
backbenchers with an uncompromising appeal for party unity.

FT  23 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Major urges Tory rebels to think
again
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR yesterday delivered an impassioned warning that unless the UK
honoured its obligations it would lose its growing influence within the
European Community.
In a vigorous speech opening yesterday's set-piece debate on the social
chapter, the prime minister made an urgent and direct appeal to potential
Tory rebels to think again before joining opposition parties in a 'cynical'
vote for the social chapter.
He was particularly vitriolic about the Liberal Democrats, describing their
tactics as 'frankly contemptible' given the party's pro-European stance.
His attack incensed Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader, who rejected
Mr Major's analysis, insisting that voting against the government amounted
to support for the social chapter. The prime minister called him
'ludicrous'.
The electric atmosphere in the packed Commons chamber alternated between
uproar and rapt silence, as Mr Major said that the true will of parliament
had been expressed by the 71 votes in favour of the Maastricht act. They
'should not be frustrated by one parliamentary motion'.
If there were a free-standing debate on the social chapter, he asserted, MPs
would reject it. He had been acting 'within the remit of parliament' when he
negotiated the treaty, including the opt-out from the social chapter.
Insisting that the UK would ratify the treaty, Mr Major made it clear that
the Tory Euro-sceptics were wrong to have convinced themselves that voting
with Labour would prevent ratification.
The alliance lined up against the government was 'not based on any
conviction whatsoever'. A vote cast with the aim of preventing ratification
of the treaty would be 'a cynical and disreputable vote'.
Two former rebels intervened in the prime minister's speech to announce that
they would vote with the government. 'I am always delighted to accept a
sinner returning home,' Mr Major replied.
He later earned a standing ovation from a private meeting of Tory
backbenchers with an uncompromising appeal for party unity.
The Conservative party 'does not understand and does not like division', the
prime minister said in a 20-minute speech. MPs should 'examine their own
consciences' and consider how unity could be restored.
There were also more harsh words for both main opposition parties, much to
the appreciation of his partisan audience. The Liberal Democrats had
indulged in 'breathtaking hypocrisy'. Labour was 'rehashing 1950s claptrap'.
The response from MPs filing out of the meeting was guardedly positive. One
senior backbencher intending to vote with the government in spite of
reservations described the speech as 'well judged'.
Earlier, Mr Major outlined to the cabinet the argument he intended to put to
MPs. In spite of successes, such as the British rebate, the UK had too often
allowed itself to be sidelined by uncertainty over its commitment to the EC.
To reform the community and shape the agenda on issues such as enlargement
and free trade, Britain had to work from within.
In the debate he resisted the conclusion drawn by opposition MPs that this
analysis showed that the UK should be part of the social chapter also.
'The good European does not accept every piece of nonsense from Brussels
because it has a European label,' he said. It was just one example of the
direct and plain language that marked a Commons speech studded with
soundbites for much of its 40 minutes.
'The one certain impact of the social chapter is that jobs will be lost,' Mr
Major said.
Even before such a significant debate, Mr Major had to undergo his
twice-weekly ordeal at the hands of a noisy and high spirited Commons at
prime minister's question-time.
This occasion developed into a duel between Tory loyalists, and Labour MPs
goading him over Maastricht.
But the light-heartedness that can overcome the Commons even at some moments
of high drama showed too. Mr Kevin Barron, Labour MP for Rother Valley,
asked whether Mr Major thought the other 11 EC member states were 'mad' for
supporting the social chapter. 'I don't think I would precisely put it that
way myself,' the prime minister replied, smiling broadly.

FT  23 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Eels and deals in pursuit of a
watertight passage - War of nerves continues to last minute as Maastricht
social chapter issue reaches a stormy Commons climax
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR tried to conjure an image of serene determination. He seemed
to see Maastricht as a stately swan, enjoying an inexorable drift towards
ratification. This he implied, was a day for a spot of fishing or baiting
the opposition parties.
But beneath the surface, government business managers paddled frantically to
stop the ship sinking.
A shaft of July sun through the high windows of the Commons' chamber turned
the prime minister's grey hair to a bright silver.
On the benches opposite sat the menacing figure of Mr James Molyneaux,
Ulster Unionist leader, and - in a eagle's nest position in the gallery -
the bespectacled Mr James Cran, a Tory Euro-sceptic ring-leader.
The drama had begun to unfold earlier. The cabinet met, the whips began
calculations. On the terrace at lunchtime, it was jolly weather for messing
about with votes.
Would Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, have to rise from
his sick bed? Perhaps a boat down the Thames from his Oxfordshire home,
suggested an aide. The nine Ulster Unionist MPs met and discussed tactics,
but remained silent on how they would vote.
Over lunch, Tory Euro-sceptics were confident of victory. Later they were
not so sure. 'The social chapter is difficult for some of our boys to vote
for,' admited one. 'But the whips are running around like red-bummed bees.'
By evening, as Mr Major gave his end-of term pep talk to the 1922 Committee,
there was loud desk thumping. But later news of an emergency cabinet meeting
triggered deep Tory fears that his appeal to loyalty would not be enough.
In the chamber, as rational debate turned to fractious political
point-scoring, it was clear the plot was being hatched elsewhere. Mr Richard
Ryder, the chief whip, was not in his usual seat; Mr Molyneaux held his
order papers to his lips as he confered with colleagues.
But the prime minister's performance was effective nevertheless. Loyal MPs
cheered as Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader, was left flustered by
a homely metaphor of a boy fisher catching a wriggling eel. It was Mr Major
on the soap-box - humble but passionate, grateful for support.
'I am always delighted to accept a sinner returning home,' he said as Mr
John Carlisle renounced his links with the Euro-rebels.
With his meek grin and the air of a man staking his political reputation on
the Commons' votes, the prime minister might have chosen words direct from
the Old Testament: 'Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die.'

FT  23 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: A sharp reminder of fight to come
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT WAS the shortest contribution of the day by a Euro-sceptic. But it was
one of the most effective.
Sir Peter Tapsell rose straight-backed from his seat directly behind Mr
Major and icily congratulated the prime minister on 'his latest convert'.
Coming straight after two of his Euro-sceptic colleagues - Mr Michael Lord
and Mr John Carlisle - had confirmed they intended to side with the
government in the coming vote, the MP for Lindsey East's barbed remark was a
sharp reminder Mr Major had a fight on his hands.
Mrs Teresa Gorman, the MP for Billericay, offered a catalogue of British
industries which had suffered at the hands of EC regulations.
The determined Mrs Gorman had been the first Euro-sceptic of the day to
preach defiance, during a predictably rowdy session of prime minister's
questions.
She characteristically pulled no punches in labelling the social chapter a
'red herring'.
If Britain signed up to Maastricht the European courts would have the power
to impose the conditions enshrined in the chapter anyway, she argued. It
followed that MPs who did not want that to happen should be 'voting tonight
to try and prevent ratification'.
Mr Major's curt response that his backbench colleague was 'entirely wrong'
and should 'reconsider her position before 10 o'clock' was almost drowned
out by Labour cheering.
'The Lady is not for turning,' shouted Mr Denis Skinner, the left-wing
Labour MP for Bolsover, appreciatively.
With opportunities to speak in the six-hour debate strictly limited, several
Euro-sceptics had to be content with brief interventions in the prime
minister's speech.
Mr Nicholas Winterton, the MP for Macclesfield, said he was 'greatly
encouraged' by what Mr Major had to say but asked for an assurance that
sterling would not return to the EC exchange rate mechanism while he was
prime minister.
Mr Carlisle said the decision of a manufacturing company in his Luton North
constituency to consider closing down its European interests because of the
costs imposed by the social chapter had prompted him to change his mind and
vote with the govern-ment.
Later Sir Teddy Taylor, the Euro-sceptic Tory MP for Southend East, made an
impassioned appeal for MPs to support Labour's amendment.

LEADERS of firefighters yesterday stepped up their opposition to the
government's 1.5 per cent public-sector pay limit with a decision to recall
their union's annual delegate to confirm rejection of the offer and decide
whether or not to take strike action.

MR MICHAEL HOWARD, the home secretary, is set to meet chief police officers
to discuss the radical proposals on pay and conditions in the Sheehy report.
The depth of anger among the country's 180,000 officers was clearly
demonstrated at Tuesday's rally at Wembley Arena denouncing the report.
Sheehy proposes fixed-term appointments, performance-related pay and changes
in pension rights, allowances and rank structure.
The three staff associations representing all ranks will hold meetings with
senior Home Office officials over the next three days to try to find common
ground.
It is likely Mr Howard will meet the senior officers on Tuesday.

FT  23 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Technical document raises ire and
passion - A look at what the social chapter would actually mean for this
country
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR SOMETHING capable of arousing such passion the social chapter of the
Maastricht treaty is disappointingly short and technical.
The chapter reduces the scope of national veto in the field of employment
regulation, where the UK stands somewhat apart from the rest of the European
Community. It extends qualified majority voting - currently only applicable
to health and safety matters - to areas such as working conditions, the
information and consultation of workers, and gender equality at work.
Without the opt-out the government negotiated, it could have been forced to
accept directives on issues such as the introduction of works councils.
The introduction of works councils, likely to be the first issue agreed by
the 11 social chapter countries, illustrates how trivial the effects of some
such directives can be. The councils will meet no more than twice a year, to
be informed of company plans.
The case may also illustrate the limits to the opt-out. Not only will the UK
still be subject to existing EC employment legislation, but even those
directives agreed by the 11 will affect many large UK companies. At least
100 UK multinationals will be affected by the works-council directive
through their continental operations.
British unions are certain to exert pressure to ensure that they are not
excluded from any rights European workers are granted through the chapter.
The chapter includes another list of areas - such as social security,
protection of workers when dismissed, and employment conditions of workers
from outside the EC - which will continue to be subject to unanimous voting,
thus causing the UK little difficulty.
The government's biggest objection is to Article 118a of the treaty - part
of the chapter - which for the first time in any international treaty
strongly endorses collective bargaining. It insists not only that unions and
employers are consulted on the content of EC directives, but that in some
circumstances they could draw up and implement directives through
legally-backed collective bargaining.
This would probably have no direct effect on the UK, which does not have the
appropriate bargaining institutions. But it shows why a government which,
alone in the EC, strongly backs labour market deregulation and has severe
doubts about collective bargaining, finds the social chapter difficult to
stomach.
This is partly a symbolic debate. The minimum standard employment directives
affect labour markets only very slightly and do not directly affect
pay-setting or rights of association. Also, with continental unemployment
rising Brussels has become more reserved about loading new costs on
employers.
But partly because of the UK's lightly regulated labour market, directives
such as that agreed on working time will have a substantial impact on some
employers, for example by introducing statutory paid holidays for the first
time.

FT  23 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Smith and Ashdown warn PM against
exceeding power of office
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN SMITH, the Labour leader, yesterday warned Mr John Major that if he
sought to defy the will of the house on the Maastricht treaty he would have
'exceeded the power of his office'.
Calling on MPs to support the social provisions of the treaty, Mr Smith
claimed that the debate was more about the 'tattered reputation of a
discredited prime minister' than the national interest.
This theme was taken up by Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader, who
told Mr Major that if the vote went against the government 'we expect him to
obey it'.
To Labour cheers Mr Smith insisted that Britain had no future as the
'sweatshop of Europe', and forecast accelerating economic decline if the
policies of social devaluation which lay behind the attempt to opt out from
the social chapter continued.
Brushing aside suggestions from Conservative backbenchers that acceptance of
the social chapter would mean a return to union domination he emphasised
that it did not extend to pay the right of association and the right to
strike.
Mr Smith said Britain was alone among the 12 member states of the European
Community in opposing a modest extension of its competence to such matters
as the protection of health and safety of people at work and equality of
opportunity between men and women.
He accused the prime minister of increasingly inhabiting a 'Walter Mitty
world' in which he alone suffered from the delusion that getting Britain
excluded from a decision making process of considerable consequence
constituted a triumph.
Mr Smith said the members of the EC who embraced the social chapter had more
impressive records of competitiveness and productivity than Britain.
He added: 'What the Conservatives fail to understand is that low wages,
inadequate skills, and persistent under investment are the real drag anchors
on Britain's economic performance.'
Denouncing the government for what he said was its 'crude' approach to
international competition, Mr Smith said it sought to compete with Taiwan on
wages rather than against Germany on skills.
In the real world the new economic agenda required a new approach - a
positive combination of skills development, decent and humane standards, and
ever widening employment opportunities.
Mr Ashdown denied earlier assertions by the prime minister that the Liberal
Democrats would be opposing ratification of the treaty by joining with
Labour MPs and voting against the government in both divisions at the end of
the debate.
Mr Ashdown insisted that the votes were about accepting the social chapter
which his party believed could be improved through Britain being part of it
and not outside it.
He said: 'It is not the great new monster of socialism stalking across
Europe which the government tries to persuade us to believe.'

British Aerospace is pulling out of Romania and suspending a licensing

lack of payment by its local partner, Virginia Marsh reports from Bucharest.
Romaero, the state owned aircraft manufacturer, said yesterday it had
accrued a Dollars 10m debt to BAe since 1987.
The move places in doubt a Dollars 250m contract which Romaero concluded
last February to build 11 up-graded BAC 1-11s for Kiwi International, a new

<TEXT>
US and Canada are close to resolving a protracted dispute over barriers
imposed on each other's beer exports, writes Bernard Simon in Toronto.
An accord, already agreed between Ottawa and Washington, is in the process
of being cleared with Canada's 10 provincial governments, which control beer
and liquor distribution within their borders, according to an industry
source.
Last year the US slapped a Dollars 3-per-case duty on beer brewed in Ontario
in retaliation against Ontario's 10 cent-per-can 'environmental levy'.
Ontario and British Columbia have also imposed minimum prices on imported
beers, making them uncompetitive with domestic brands.
Under the draft agreement, the provinces will reduce their minimum prices
and lower a number of non-tariff barriers on imported beers. They will also
be barred from introducing any new discriminatory measures against US beer.

A CONSORTIUM led by Thames Water, the privatised UK regional utility, has
signed a Dollars 700m agreement to build and run a water supply plant in
Turkey, writes John Murray Brown in Ankara.
The plant at Izmit, south-east of Istanbul, will be operated for 15 years by
Thames which will recover the investment by selling water to the
municipality. The project is one of several under negotiation in Turkey
using the build, operate and transfer method of financing.
Philipp Holzmann of Germany is leading a construction consortium on the
DM2bn (Dollars 1.1bn) Birecik dam project near the Syrian border. Enron,
acting for Midland Electricity, the privatised UK power utility, together
with Wing Merril, the private US engineering consultant, are negotiating a
Dollars 1bn power plant project for the Marmara region.
Thames's implementation agreement was signed this week by the consortium and
the mayor of Izmit at the end of a five-day visit to Turkey by Mr Richard
Needham, Britain's trade minister. UK content in the project is worth
Dollars 240m.
The consortium still has to agree loan terms and treasury guarantees,
although executives regarded the presence at the signing of Mr Osman Unsal,
head of the Turkish treasury, as clear indication the government was
prepared to back the deal.
PWT Worldwide, Thames's wholly-owned subsidiary, together with the Turkish
partners Gama and Guris, will conclude work on a partly completed dam and
build two pumping stations and more than 100km of mains piping. Construction
is expected to be complete in 1997.
The financial package is to include Japanese aid funds, export credits,
commercial loans and a 15 per cent equity portion put up by the consortium
partners.

<TEXT>
DEUTSCHE Telekom, the German state-owned telecoms monopoly, and
Intertelekom, the Russian state-owned long distance telephone operator,
yesterday signed a memorandum of understanding to co-operate on a Dollars
1bn (Pounds 660m) project to modernise Russia's telecommunications
infrastructure.
The project involves a consortium of western telecoms groups which will
invest up to Dollars 600m to install a digital overlay network connecting
Russian cities with western Europe. The Russian side is expected to invest
Dollars 400m in the project.
German officials said Deutsche Telekom was the first foreign company to sign
a memorandum of understanding for the network; the final project would
probably be granted to a consortium involving three of four western telecoms
groups.
The memorandum was signed during a visit by Mr Wolfgang Botsch, German post
and telecoms minister, to Moscow. Mr Vladimir Bulgak, his Russian
counterpart, said the project would start next year.
The project, called '50 times 50', plans to build 50,000km of glass fibre
cables above the normal telecoms infrastructure.
The cables will connect 50 Russian cities with 50 connecting points in the
west.
Deutsche Telekom said it would use its experience in eastern Germany to
modernise the Russian telecoms infrastructure. The German monopoly installed
an initial 3,000km long digital overlay network in eastern Germany in 1991.
The network, which initially connected eastern and western cities within
Germany, is now replacing the original analogue network in eastern Germany.
Deutsche Telekom also installed a radio system connecting telephone
operators to the digital network until proper cable links are in place.
The German company is also participating in a joint venture to establish
satellite links connecting the former Soviet republics and other eastern
European countries with western partners.
Participants in the joint venture, called Romantis, include Bosch, the
German engineering company, and Dornier, the German aerospace group.

<TEXT>
CONGRESSMAN Richard Gephardt, majority leader in the US House of
Representatives, said yesterday he would introduce legislation in September
requiring the administration to enforce the US-Japan negotiating framework
agreement reached at the Tokyo economic summit.
While praising President Bill Clinton for getting 'serious' about the US
trade deficit with Japan, he scoffed at the Japanese government's claim that
it could not force liberalisation on the private sector. 'Often it is
impossible to determine where the government leaves off and the private
sector begins,' he said.
His legislation would require the US government to issue yearly assessments
of US-Japan sectoral agreements, set industry targets for market access and
levy sanctions if the Japanese still keep their market closed.
It will 'short-circuit the investigation phase' in a trade complaint 'and go
immediately to consultations. . . If any agreement can't be reached, action
would occur'.
The support of Mr Gephardt, the most influential House member on trade
issues, is vitally important to Mr Clinton. The two have spent hours
discussing the North American Free Trade Agreement, but the congressman is
still threatening to oppose the pact unless it satisfies his concerns about
jobs and the environment.
He insists that he will not support 'an agreement that isn't paid for'.

The US became the largest seller of arms to the third world last year, while
the overall sales of armaments to that market decreased, Aaron Lewis reports
from Washington.
A study by the Congressional Research Service said the US was responsible
for 57 per cent, compared with Russia's 9 per cent.
Worldwide weapons sales reflected Russia's reduced performance totalling
only Dollars 23.9bn last year, Dollars 4.7bn less than in 1991.
The third world, in particular, has imported fewer weapons in the wake of
the dissolution of the Soviet Union. This affected in particular Vietnam,
Cuba and Syria.

The BOT concept was pioneered by Turkey's late President Turgut Ozal as a
way to establish large public infrastructure without affecting the
government's balance sheet, an important consideration at a time of severe
budget constraints and large foreign debt payments.
The argument for BOT is that as the private sector takes the risk financial
disciplines are tighter, because repayment is directly dependent on project
completion.
PWT Worldwide, Thames's wholly owned subsidiary, together with the Turkish
partners Gama and Guris, will conclude work on a partly completed dam,

Construction is expected to be complete in 1997.
The financial package is to include Japanese aid funds, export credits,

Chase Manhattan, financial advisers to the project, say the credit package
will be submitted next week to the UK Export Credit Guarantee Department and
other European agencies. Syndication with UK and Japanese commercial banks
will follow.

HITACHI will sell Macintosh personal computers made by Apple of the US as
part of its client-server systems, the Japanese electronics group said
yesterday.
The deal reflects the growing interdependence of companies in the computer
industry as well as a move towards more open systems in which computer users
are able to use a combination of machines from different companies.
Hitachi will buy the PCs from Canon Sales, a subsidiary of the camera and
office equipment maker which is one of Apple's main distributors in Japan.
Canon Sales for its part will sell Hitachi's workstations and servers. A
server is the master computer in a PC network which stores and provides
access to programmes and network facilities. The deal - the first tie-up
between the two companies - also calls for Hitachi and Canon Sales to
develop software jointly for the new systems.
The Macintosh PCs to be sold by Hitachi will be part of its client-server
systems which will use Hitachi's workstations for the central database and
Apple's PCs as the client.
Apple has been making substantial inroads into the Japanese computer market
and, according to Dataquest, the high technology consultancy, it is in third
place in market share, with 8.3 per cent of the market.
Hitachi currently sells systems using its own PCs but the company felt the
growing interest among Japanese users for more open systems, and the
popularity of the Macintosh in Japan, called for offering Apple's PCs in its
systems.

FT  23 JUL 93 / World Trade News: Patents plans 'sow seeds of destruction' -
Warnings of the consequences of copyright draft
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SHIRAZ SIDHVA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THOUSANDS of farmers gathered this week at Navalgund, a hamlet in Karnataka,
11 hours from Bangalore, to launch a seed satyagraha, or non-violent
protest, against multinational companies in the seeds business.
They are members of a powerful association of small farmers in the lush
southern Indian state who attacked the administrative blocks of the Cargill
Seeds factory in Siravara near Bellary last week.
Despite the farmers having razed the buildings, Mr M D Nanjundaswamy,
president of the farmers' union, insists that he is a follower of Mahatma
Gandhi, and says they had 'rightly and rightfully' attacked the US
multinational's premises, the second action against the company in less than
a year.
Cargill was targeted first, because 'they are one of the biggest seeds
producers in the world, who use their clout to impoverish third world
farmers,' says the 57-year-old law professor-turned farmers' messiah.
'Cargill and other multinationals have a philosophy that threatens the very
sovereignty of the nation. And we will continue to attack them.'
The average Indian farmer knows little about the Uruguay Round of the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade which seeks to tighten patent laws in
developing countries. But Mr Nanjundaswamy has taken it upon himself to
interpret the implications to India of the Dunkel draft proposals on
trade-related aspects of intellectual property rights (TRIPS).
'The installation of a patents regime in genes, plants and all farm inputs,
where none exists, is to gain control of a nation covertly,' he says.
Cargill and other companies that have set up joint ventures in Karnataka
deny that they are draining Indian genetic resources. They claim that all
hybrid seeds sold by the company are derived from imported germ plasm, and
that yields have improved considerably since they started marketing their
seeds to farmers at competitive prices.
The Karnataka farmers fear that transnational and multinational
corporations, with their patent-protected seeds, chemicals, money and clout,
will push them off the land.
Ms Usha Menon, scientist at the National Institute for Science, Technology
and Development and a member of the national working group on patent laws,
says that if India accepts the suggestions made by Mr Arthur Dunkel, former
director-general of Gatt, the massive informal farmer-to-farmer seed
exchange that thousands of Indian farmers depend upon will no longer be
possible.
'Farmers have been getting foundation seeds from the agricultural
universities and multiplying them for their own use and selling them to
other farmers,' she says.
'This sharing of seeds was the lifeline of the Indian green revolution and
would be threatened if we accept the Dunkel proposals.' It would then be
obligatory for India to introduce plant breeder's rights, which would
prevent both informal sales and the freedom of multiplication.
Mr P Sainath, a Bombay-based journalist whose booklet, Patent Folly,
attempts to simplify intellectual property rights, says that the world's
genetic wealth owes much to small farmers in developing countries.
'Multinational corporations are appropriating seeds and plant varieties that
have traditionally belonged to developing nations, making some
modifications, and patenting them to sell them back to the poorer country at
much higher prices than farmers would have to pay,' he says.
Critics of plant breeders' rights have argued that the world's vast
bio-diversity should not be exploited for the commercial gain of a few
powerful companies at little or no benefit to the country from whose
resources a product is derived.
For instance, Vincristine, a cancer drug, was developed from a source grown
in Madagascar, but critics say the country derives no benefit from the
drug's million-dollar market.
In another case, a gene for insect resistance in soyabean and maize crops
was isolated from a cowpea seed from Nigeria. Two American companies have
patented the seed.
Dr R B Singh of the UN's Food and Agricultural Organisation says that
developing nations could be excluded from certain technologies which should
rightly be theirs.
For instance, a hybrid rice technology developed by the Chinese and patented
by two American firms is too expensive for many farmers in China to afford.
In Malaysia, oil palm research suffered when multinationals patented the
wild germ plasm and were not willing to share it with researchers in the
Malaysian government.
The Indian commerce ministry is still to decide whether the government
should accept the Dunkel draft's final act. 'We are not just going to sign
on any dotted line,' said Mr Tejinder Khanna, the new commerce secretary.
'Other contracting parties in Gatt should positively appreciate India's
concerns, since one-sixth of the world's population lives here.'

FT  23 JUL 93 / Iraq backs down on arms monitoring
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IRAQ has agreed to United Nations monitoring of its nuclear, chemical,
biological and heavy weapons capability in a bid to have sanctions lifted,
the Security Council was told last night.
After five days of negotiations in Baghdad, Mr Rolf Ekeus, head of the UN
weapons inspection commission, said agreement had been reached and
high-level technical talks on its implementation would begin in New York at
the end of August.
Meanwhile, a UN technical team was due to go to Baghdad today to mount
surveillance cameras at two missile sites at the centre of a confrontation
between the UN and Iraq, which had refused until this week to permit such
installation.
The cameras will not be activated immediately. Their operation will be among
matters to be discussed in the negotiations.
Mr Tariq Aziz, the Iraqi deputy prime minister, provided what Mr Ekeus
termed explicit assurances of adequate notice before any test firings and to
facilitate inspections whenever and as often as the commission felt
necessary.
At a press conference, the UN official said he was confident his inspectors
would soon learn of any Iraqi attempts to fire rockets, even those up to a
range of 150km permitted under the ceasefire resolution, let alone rockets
above that limit.
In response to Iraq's request for the lifting of sanctions in return for its
co-operation, he had undertaken to report to the Security Council if and
when Baghdad was in full compliance with all of the provisions relating to
weapons.
He noted that the imposition of the oil embargo was linked directly to those
provisions.
The US and Britain are said to want to insist that Iraq first observe the
resolutions concerning human rights, including those of the Kurds and Shias.
Referring to talks now in suspense on the proposed sale of Dollars 1.6bn of
Iraqi oil under a limited waver of sanctions, Mr Ekeus said that while there
was no formal link, he had addressed some aspects of this at the request of
Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary-general.

FT  23 JUL 93 / Kanemaru pleads not guilty
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PUSHED into the courtroom in a wheelchair, Mr Shin Kanemaru, the once
all-powerful godfather of the ruling Liberal Democratic party, yesterday sat
calmly through the first day of what is seen as the trial of the traditional
Japanese way of politics.
Mr Kanemaru, 78, pleaded not guilty to evading Y1.037bn (Pounds 6.3m) in
taxes due on funds raised from the construction and other sympathetic
industries that prosecutors say were for personal use. However, Mr Kanemaru
claims that the money was needed to realise his 'cherished dream of
political reform.'
Raids on Mr Kanemaru's home and office uncovered a remarkable Y5bn haul of
gold bars, bank debentures and cash, part of the assets used to maintain his
position as the LDP's pre-eminent power broker, fixing political disputes
and backing loyal MPs. He suggested the funds were 'tokens of gratitude'
from enthusiastic supporters.
Prosecutors intend the case to be a warning to other politicians and their
corporate donors. Related investigations have already led to the resignation
of a provincial mayor and the arrest of executives at four leading
construction companies for alleged bribery.
Mr Kanemaru is alleged to have accumulated Y1.842bn of taxable funds from
1987 and to have concealed the money through the purchase of
difficult-to-trace bank debentures.
The trial of Mr Kanemaru and his former secretary, Mr Masahisa Haibara, 49,
alleged to have evaded Y307m in taxes, comes in the middle of a debate on
reform of a political system prone to scandal.
An unusual confession last year from Mr Kanemaru that he had received Y500m
in illicit funds from a trucking company, Sagawa Kyubin, set the case in
motion after public anger that prosecutors then showed unusual tolerance in
allowing him to draft a statement from his home.
Sensing their reputation had been tarnished, the prosecutors began a tougher
investigation into his finances and into his well-known links with the
construction industry, an important source of LDP funds.
The prosecutors' opening statements yesterday did not implicate other
leading politicians, but it is expected that the case will prove extremely
embarrassing for politicians close to Mr Kanemaru.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PAKISTAN'S new caretaker government, headed by Mr Moeen Qureshi, a former
World Bank official, yesterday devalued the rupee by 6 per cent in an
attempt to boost exports, writes Farhan Bokhari in Islamabad.
The finance ministry said international currency movements had caused
distortions in Pakistan's trade and the government had determined that a
significant adjustment was required.
The move, which followed a 3 per cent devaluation on July 15, set the
official rate at Rs29.85/29.99 to the dollar. It was welcomed by exporters
and on the Karachi stock market, where textile shares rose in expectations
of improved profits.
The All Pakistan Textile Mills Association, the leading manufacturers'
association, had demanded a devaluation to overcome competition from cheaper
Indian and Chinese exports.
Pakistani export earnings in the financial year which ended on June 30 were
Dollars 6.8bn (Pounds 4.5bn), little changed from Dollars 6.7bn the previous
year but far below the targeted Dollars 8bn.
Mr Mir Afzal Khan, acting president of the Federation of Pakistan Chambers
of Commerce and Industry, said: 'This is a first step in the right
direction. It was badly needed to compete with Indian goods.'
Officials said the impact on prices would not become clear for two or three
months.

FT  23 JUL 93 / Guerrillas in new attack on Israelis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROGER MATTHEWS, Middle East Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE danger of a big military confrontation in south Lebanon increased
sharply yesterday after Iranian-backed guerrillas launched a new offensive
against Israeli positions and those held by their local allies.
At least one Israeli soldier died in the attacks launched by Hizbollah, the
Lebanese Shia militia, and by the radical Palestinian faction, the Popular
Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command, headed by Ahmed
Jibril.
They attacked positions within Israel's self-declared security zone in south
Lebanon using artillery, rockets and heavy gun fire. Several members of the
South Lebanon Army, financed and armed by Israel, were also reported to have
been wounded.
Israel has reinforced its presence in the south of Lebanon in response to
Hizbollah attacks on July 8 and 9 which cost the lives of five Israeli
soldiers. Lt Gen Ehud Barak, the Israeli army chief of staff, warned this
week that an attempt to wipe out guerrilla bases would be inevitable if the
attacks did not cease.
Mr Mohsen Dalloul, Lebanon's defence minister, responded that the entire
country would be mobilised if it faced a large-scale invasion.
Israel hit back against yesterday's attacks with artillery fire and
helicopter gunships were in action against suspected guerrilla positions.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CHINA yesterday ordered its military to stop using public funds to gamble in
property and foreign exchange trading, Reuter reports from Beijing.
An order from the Central Military Commission, published in all the main
newspapers, demanded that illegal uses of funds should be investigated and
the culprits punished.
The attempt to rein in speculative fever in the military came as Vice
Premier Zou Jiahua promised stern measures to crack down on real estate
speculation throughout the country that has caused heavy losses to the
state.
The Ministry of Justice joined the campaign to restore economic order,
forbidding lawyers from giving professional advice to 'illegal fundraising'
activities, including unapproved stock and bond issues. China is trying to
reassert control over an economy that is overheating  - growth is at nearly
14 per cent a year and inflation in large cities is more than 20 per cent.
'Military funds must not be put into personal savings accounts,' the Central
Military Commission order said. 'It is strictly forbidden to speculate in
foreign exchange.'
The military commission, which commands the 3m-strong People's Liberation
Army, ordered an end to expensive projects that have nothing to do with
defence. Real estate speculation has turned much of China's countryside into
a building site and sent the costs of raw materials soaring.

FT  23 JUL 93 / Miyazawa resigns as LDP leader
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Kiichi Miyazawa, citing a Confucian saying that 'the righteous worry
not', yesterday announced his resignation as president of the Liberal
Democratic party, setting off a brawl over the choice of Japan's next prime
minister.
Party executives had wanted to form an exclusive committee among themselves
to hand-pick a successor, but young LDP parliamentarians rebelled, accusing
the elders of 'undermining public confidence' in the party and forcing a
vote on the issue.
In the past, a new LDP president has simultaneously become prime minister,
but the party's loss of a parliamentary majority in last Sunday's election
has meant that the next leader of the LDP will not necessarily lead the
country.
Mr Miyazawa will be prime minister until an extraordinary session of
parliament early next month, when a new leader will be chosen.
If opposition parties are able to form a coalition and agree on a candidate,
they will have the numbers to defeat the LDP candidate in the Japanese
parliament.
In the meantime, the LDP's five large factions must select a successor
acceptable both to the party and to the coalition partner that they will
need to ensure that their choice does become prime minister.
If yesterday's meeting is a guide, the party faces a torrid couple of weeks
in satisfying older leaders, who want their turn at the top, and younger
MPs, who want the party to appoint a proven reformer to lead an overhaul of
the political system.
Mr Seiroku Kajiyama, the LDP secretary-general, suggested the formation of a
'unity and progress association' to select a successor. However, the idea
provoked outrage among younger members, one of whom said that the 'public
detests the look and the smell of the LDP.'
Seeing himself as the party's new fixer, replacing Mr Shin Kanemaru, whose
tax evasion trial began yesterday, Mr Kajiyama has blundered in recent weeks
and is blamed by some young MPs for the splitting of the party last month
and the loss of a majority.
'I regard Prime Minister Miyazawa as a class C war criminal, and I demand
that class A and class B war criminals also take responsibility,' the head
of an LDP reform committee told the meeting, referring to the political
fray.
In conveying his decision, Mr Miyazawa preferred to see himself as a
Confucian scholar, as he recalled the saying:'Sages do not suffer confusion,
the righteous worry not, and the courageous fear not.'

FT  23 JUL 93 / 'Model patient' Morocco keeps medicine down: The signs are
that persisting with its textbook reforms is having the desired effect
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCIS GHILES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS no accident that Mr Edouard Balladur, the French prime minister, has
chosen Morocco as the first non-western country to visit since he came to
power.
As he meets King Hassan and members of his government over the next few
days, he will be lending public support to the country's economic reforms
and to its strategy of tying itself ever more closely to the European
Community, at a time when both policies are showing conspicuous signs of
bearing fruit.
On the economic front, gross domestic product is set to grow again this
year, by 2-3 per cent, after a 3 per cent drop in 1992, in spite of a severe
drought at home and the continuing downturn in western Europe, its main
export market.
What is significant, while Morocco's economic performance remains vulnerable
to climatic changes (farming represents roughly a fifth of GDP), is that the
renewed confidence is attributable mainly to a rise in manufacturing exports
and increased foreign investment - both direct results of 10 years of
reform.
Foreign observers are now speaking of Morocco as a model for other patients
of the international financial institutions to follow. It stands 'where the
IMF would like countries like Egypt to be', says Mr Miles Moreland, of
Blakeney Management, an investment adviser.
International investors have shown they agree: foreign investment has risen
fourfold since 1988 to an estimated Dollars 500m (Pounds 333m) last year -
spurred in part by government plans to privatise 112 companies worth an
estimated Dollars 2.2bn by the end of 1995. The privatisation programme is
expected to bring Dollars 250m worth of foreign exchange receipts in 1993.
The minister of industry and privatisation, Mr Moulay Zine Zahidi, likes to
point out that in 1992 external financing in the form of foreign direct
investment covered the whole of the Dollars 500m current account deficit.
This is a marked change from 10 years ago, when Morocco was forced to
reschedule its foreign debt. While the burden of the Dollars 21.5bn foreign
debt remains significant, with total external debt at 80 per cent of GDP,
the debt service ratio (debt principal and interest payments as a proportion
of export earnings)has been halved to about 34 per cent - helped by Saudi
Arabia's forgiveness of nearly Dollars 3bn worth of loans to thank King
Hassan for support during the Gulf war.
Official reserves increased from virtually nil to Dollars 3.4bn, the
equivalent of more than four months' imports.
As important have been the government's textbook economic reforms. Since
1983 taxes, tariffs and subsidies have been cut. Maximum tariff levels are
down from 400 per cent to 35 per cent and Morocco has become a member of
Gatt. Earlier this year, the dirham became convertible for current account
operations.
A budget deficit which was running at 12 per cent of GDP 10 years ago was
cut to 1.7 per cent in 1992. This has been at the price of a sharp reduction
in state investment but also higher tax receipts and a more efficient tax
system.
Real GDP growth averaged 4.5 per cent between 1985 and 1991 while inflation
was at 5.6 per cent over the same period.
Positive change has been evident in Morocco's relations with the EC. Six
years ago, King Hassan's declared intention of applying for Community
membership was greeted in Brussels with a mixture of incredulity and scorn.
Last winter, however, the EC agreed to a Moroccan request to negotiate later
this year what promises to be one of the closest partnership treaties
covering free trade and political co-operation between the Community and a
non-EC country.
European countries (as well as the US) have also been heartened by the
king's decision to act forcefully on illegal immigration and drug smuggling.
This has secured Morocco commitments of Dollars 1bn for the development of
the kingdom's northern region - the main centre of cannabis cultivation.
All this is not to say that the path of reform, however strongly the
government may be politically committed to it, is problem-free. A recent
report from Citicorp, the US-based banking group, cautioned: 'It remains to
be seen whether the Moroccan administration will succeed in balancing
continuing economic adjustment with the risk of increased social instability
as the unemployment rate remains high, at an estimated 20 per cent in 1992.'
The reforms enacted since 1983 have increased already large income
disparities and all agree that a 55 per cent illiteracy rate among men and
the resulting low labour qualifications constitute a serious handicap for
the expanding export sector.
A confidential World Bank study recently noted: 'There has been no
significant expansion (of overall manufacturing) relative to GDP since 1980.
Although recent manufacturing growth has been better than average for lower
middle-income countries, out-turns are less impressive when compared with
several developing countries that are Morocco's international competitors.'
Moroccan manufacturing faces three further challenges. The first is to move
up the technology ladder faster. There are encouraging signs. In the last
five years, the export of value-added products has doubled, moving from 22
to 30 per cent of the total.
The second is to spread export activity beyond the traditional
Casablanca-Rabat corridor. The country's trade performance remains
critically dependent on France which accounts for nearly a third of all
exports.
The third is to diversify the sources of foreign investment. Here the most
notable fact is the fast rise of Spain, which is consolidating its recently
won position as the kingdom's second largest trade partner and source of
foreign investment after France.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SINGAPORE yesterday voiced Asian concerns about China's drive to modernise
its armed forces and reassert its claims to the disputed Spratly islands, as
foreign ministers arrived in Singapore for a meeting likely to endorse the
creation of a new forum to discuss regional security.
Mr Wong Kan Seng, the Singapore foreign minister, had talks with Mr Qian
Qichen, his Chinese counterpart, on the eve of a ministerial meeting of the
six-member Association of South-East Asian Nations (Asean) ahead of Asean's
annual talks with its trading partners next week.
According to a Singaporean statement, Mr Wong told Mr Qian that 'some
countries were concerned about China's military modernisation and its
possible impact on China's position on the Spratlys. Mr Wong hoped China
would reassure such countries of its peaceful intentions and said regional
security dialogues were one important means of building confidence.'
The Asean members - Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore
and Thailand - have been alarmed by recent Chinese attempts to assert
control over all the islands in the South China Sea, including those claimed
by Asean states and by Vietnam.
Both China and the Asean countries are anxious to protect their fast-growing
economies from political instability, and both parties say they are willing
to engage in security talks.
Details have yet to be finalised, but some Asean officials say a forum will
be established to include Asean, its existing 'dialogue partners' (the US,
the EC, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Canada and South Korea), as well as
China and Vietnam and possibly India and Russia.
Several Asian countries are increasing defence spending in the aftermath of
the cold war, partly because they are becoming richer and partly because
they want to protect themselves as the US reduces its military presence in
the region.

MR YASUSHI MIENO, governor of the Bank of Japan, yesterday forecast a weak
economic recovery late in the year, toning down the bank's previous
forecasts of a 'mild' recovery in coming months and stirring expectations of
a cut in official interest rates.
The Bank of Japan has yet to concede that the weakening economy has hit
bottom, but the more optimistic Economic Planning Agency yesterday suggested
that 'signs of recovery' were already emerging, based on an increase in
public spending from a stimulatory package in April.
Officials at the bank and the EPA admit that the package has done little to
stimulate personal consumption and capital spending, cited as causes of the
unexpectedly long downturn and of the bank's increasingly gloomy outlook for
recovery.
A spate of indicators this week suggests that the economy turned down again
in May after appearing to have touched bottom. For the first time in four
months, the EPA's index of leading indicators fell below the 50 per cent
line between 'boom and bust,' while household spending was down 1.8 per
cent.
Japanese government officials are concerned that the yen's rapid
appreciation and political instability are undermining prospects for
recovery.
There are doubts about the ability of the Liberal Democratic party, which
has lost its parliamentary majority, to push through measures such as income
tax cuts.
Political instability has prompted Japanese businesses to turn to the Bank
of Japan, which is resisting calls for the official discount rate to be cut
from 2.5 per cent to 2 per cent, arguing that the present level is not a
barrier to economic recovery.
Meanwhile, Mr Mieno told a conference of regional bankers they must continue
to confront their growing pile of non-performing loans and attempt to
improve asset quality.
He has encouraged banks to deal with the problem more quickly than the
Finance Ministry, which again yesterday suggested that the loans be written
off in the 'longer term'.

FT  23 JUL 93 / Guerrillas in new offensive against Israel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROGER MATTHEWS, Middle East Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE danger of a big military confrontation in south Lebanon increased
sharply yesterday after Iranian-backed guerrillas launched a new offensive
against Israeli positions and those held by their local allies.
At least one Israeli soldier died in the attacks launched by Hizbollah, the
Lebanese Shia militia, and by the radical Palestinian faction, the Popular
Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command, headed by Ahmed
Jibril.
They attacked several positions within Israel's self-declared security zone
in south Lebanon using artillery, rockets and heavy machine gun fire.
Several members of the South Lebanon Army, financed and armed by Israel,
were also reported to have been wounded in the attacks.
Israel has reinforced its presence in the south of Lebanon during the past
10 days in response to Hizbollah attacks on July 8 and 9 which cost the
lives of five Israeli soldiers. Lt. Gen. Ehud Barak, the Israeli army chief
of staff, warned this week that an attempt to wipe out guerrilla bases would
be inevitable if the attacks did not cease.
Mr Mohsen Dalloul, Lebanon's defence minister, responded that the entire
country would be mobilised if it faced a large-scale invasion.
'We will not stand idly by in the face of aggression. We shall fight with
all means at our disposal,' he said in an interview on Voice of Lebanon.
Damascus radio has also warned that an attack on Lebanon would be considered
as aggression against Syria.
Israel hit back against yesterday's attacks with artillery fire and
helicopter gun - ships were in action against suspected guerrilla positions.
The fighting comes at a delicate moment in Middle East peace negotiations,
with Mr Warren Christopher, the US secretary of state, planning a visit to
the region later next week in an effort to persuade all parties to resume
negotiations in Washington next month.
Hizbollah and its Palestinian allies in south Lebanon are opposed to the
peace process which they believe will only result in a formal capitulation
to Israeli occupation of Arab territory.

FT  23 JUL 93 / Egypt and IMF in accord on debt relief deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CAIRO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EGYPT and the International Monetary Fund have agreed on a draft letter of
intent for a three-year extended fund facility which would trigger the debt
relief of about Dollars 3bn (Pounds 1.98bn) owed to the Paris Club of
creditor nations, and which charts the next phase of the country's
structural adjustment reforms.
The letter sets the terms for Egypt's second agreement with the fund since
it resumed relations with the agency in 1991. The proposed reforms will make
the country's progress towards a more open, free-market economy
'irreversible', Mr Abdel-Shakour Sha'alan, director of the fund's Middle
East department, said in Cairo.
The letter will go before the fund's board for final approval at a meeting
scheduled for September 17.
Board approval is expected to depend on Egypt first taking a series of
measures on tax and trade liberalisation.
Approval would then lead to the relief of 15 per cent of Egypt's outstanding
Paris Club debt, as it stood in May 1991 when Egypt struck its first IMF
agreement, and an accord with sovereign lenders to tie debt relief to
progress on economic reforms.
Fifteen per cent of the total debt - which then stood at more than Dollars
20bn - was written off in July 1991 and Paris Club creditors have said
further 20 per cent will be relieved if Egypt satisfies the terms of a this
second IMF agreement.
Under the first accord, Egypt cut its budget deficit to 3.5 per cent of GDP
from 20 per cent, halved inflation to 12 per cent, liberalised exchange and
interest rates, freed prices, eased import restrictions and began to cut
tariffs.
Mr Sha'alan said inflation under the proposed second agreement was set to
fall to 7-8 per cent, with the budget deficit falling to about 2.5 per cent
of gross domestic product, largely through increases in tax coverage.
He said Egypt was unlikely to draw on the Dollars 600m credit attached to
the new facility, given the accumulation of hard currency reserves of about
Dollars 16bn during the previous agreement.
'If we continue with the reforms for three years, I can imagine the economy
growing at 5 or 6 per cent annually,' Mr Sha'alan told Al-Ahram newspaper
yesterday.
That, however, will depend on Egypt having more success with structural
reforms than it has had with fiscal and monetary changes.
Economic growth is at present flat, thanks partly to the effect on tourism
of recent terrorist attacks but mostly to Egypt's sloth in revitalising the
private sector and reforming loss-making public sector industries.
Egypt's privatisation programme is well behind schedule, mired in
bureaucratic complexities and political fears about the social effects of
unemployment.
The new agreement would set targets for the number of public-sector
companies Egypt should bring to the point of sale - but the government has
so far sold only a handful of the 85 companies and assets slated for sale
under the first agreement.

LEFT-WING rebels who took control of the northern town of Estel in Nicaragua
on Wednesday surrendered to government troops yesterday after a day of heavy
fighting which left 40 people dead and more than 100 wounded.
Several hundred of the rebels, veterans of the war in the 1980s against the
US-backed Contras, had taken control of the town and cut the Pan-American
highway in protest at the government's austere economic policy.
They were led by a former Sandinista major who commanded an elite
counter-insurgency battalion.
The army deployed about 2,000 troops to retake the town, backed by armoured
vehicles and helicopter gunships. However, it said that the heavy weapons
had been used sparingly to minimise civilian casualties.
The rebels' attack was the most serious challenge to the authority of the
government of President Violeta Chamorro since she took power from the
left-wing Sandinistas in April, 1990.
Calling themselves the Workers and Peasants Revolutionary Front (FROC), the
rebels had demanded finance for small farmers and craftsmen, and free health
and education and lifetime pensions for some 100,000 demobilised troops.
They also want to stop gold mines and sugar and banana plantations being
privatised.
However, the government had refused to negotiate, and a spokesman for the
army, which continues under Sandinista control, earlier described the rebels
as 'delinquents' who would be pursued into the mountains and destroyed.
While condemning the rebels, the leadership of the Sandinista party (FSLN)
has called on the government to take urgent action to alleviate growing
poverty in the countryside.
Deep rifts have recently appeared within the party. The radical wing,
supported by leaders of trade unions and peasant farmers, wants to break
away from what has evolved into a coalition government of social democrats,
other centrists and FSLN moderates.
The army, under General Umberto Ortega, is firmly behind the government.
However, the government is now being attacked from both right and left as
austerity measures implemented over the past two years have cut social
services sharply and increased unemployment.
A loose alliance of right-wing and left-wing rebels in the mountains has
been skirmishing with the army for the past year. They are thought to number
around 1,500.

FT  23 JUL 93 / Castro looks to the dollar for help: Legalising foreign
exchange aimed at saving economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR 30 years no Cuban has legally possessed a US dollar or any other foreign
currency because of a law as much an instrument of economic control as
defiant symbol of Cuban nationalism.
But with the economy in ruins and recent measures at resuscitating it having
failed, President Fidel Castro is looking for salvation from the former
enemy. His government is set to legalise the possession of all foreign
currency, perhaps his most significant market economic reform yet.
Mr Castro first aired the proposal at the end of last month before the Cuban
parliament. Last week Mr Carlos Lage, the reform-minded minister in charge
of the economy, made it official. He told visiting foreign businessmen that
new laws legalising possession and use of dollars would soon be presented to
parliament.
Currency convertibility is being proposed partly in the hope that it might
encourage the 1m Cuban-Americans to send hundreds of millions of dollars a
year to impoverished relatives in Cuba. Under US law, an American citizen
can send a relative in Cuba up to Dollars 300 (Pounds 200) a quarter.
But the political consequences would be far-reaching. While Cubans are
increasingly using dollars as the only currency of value, and buying goods
with it on the black market, the proposed reform would cause the government
to cede control over the distribution of wealth. A Communist party
apparatchik may find himself worse off than a dissident with generous donors
in Miami.
The details of the law have still to be made public. Still, Mr Lage told
foreign journalists that they would have an 'undeniable social impact,
giving certain persons independence and access to goods, and create
divisions that have not been customary since the revolution'.
Cuban officials accompanying the visiting businessmen earlier sketched out a
scheme where a Cuban would swap the donated dollars for dollar vouchers,
with which he could buy goods in 'dollar shops', while giving the government
much needed foreign currency. As long as such dollar shops offered fair
prices, the black market would lose much of its point.
Eventually the so-called parallel market in non-rationed goods, which closed
in 1991 because of the economic crisis, might open again with all
transactions carried out in dollars. The reforms, as one European diplomat
commented in Havana, would constitute a necessary step in creating market
prices for all non-rationed goods.
With prices pegged to dollars in the parallel (non-rationed) market, it is
likely the peso would be devalued from the official rate of one to one. Even
now, because of an informal 'dollarisation' of the economy, one dollar buys
60 pesos in the black market.
At this exchange rate, the typical monthly salary now buys between Dollars 2
and Dollars 4 - or two to four bottles of cooking oil on the black market.
With peso salaries worth so little, the government might come under pressure
to liberalise wages and allow workers, such as farmers, to sell some of
their goods freely. While Mr Lage said wages would not be set in dollars, he
pointedly did not exclude a return to the free market in some farm products
that existed for a while in the mid-1980s.
He said the latest economic opening 'was not part of a definite or final end
but part of an on-going process'.
The willingness to legalise the dollar and risk the political costs is a
measure of the dire state of the Cuban economy and of the failure so far of
a limited economic opening to improve conditions. The overtures to foreign
capital are believed to have brought in just Dollars 500m over the past
couple of years, according to Mr Andrew Zimbalist, a Cuba expert at Smith
College, Massachusetts. This is a fraction of the annual aid and subsidies
Cuba used to receive from the former Soviet bloc.
Since the collapse of the Soviet bloc in 1989, the Cuban economy is reckoned
to have shrunk by about half, while imports have fallen from Dollars 8.1bn
to Dollars 2.2bn last year. This year the economy is likely to be reduced by
another 10 per cent, says Mr Zimbalist, in part because of this year's
wretched sugar crop, which is forecast at 4.2m tonnes, 40 per cent down from
last year.
While the disintegrating economy has yet to provoke signs of overt and
organised opposition to Mr Castro, daily life is becoming increasingly
difficult. Electricity blackouts from anything up to eight hours are common,
Havana residents often wait three hours for a bus, and basic necessities
such as soap and cooking oil are unavailable in shops for weeks at a time.
The lack of spare parts and energy means most factories are closed, as
attested by thousands of people roaming Havana streets in working hours
apparently with nothing to do. A recent outbreak of more than 45,000 cases
of a neural disease that can cause blindness has been attributed in part to
malnutrition.

<TEXT>
THE Clinton administration is planning to reduce drastically the number of
charges in its indictment of Mr Christopher Drogoul, the former manager of
the Atlanta branch of Italy's Banca Nazionale del Lavoro accused of making
Dollars 5bn of illegal loans to Iraq.
The Justice Department's formal court filing of the new indictment, which is
expected to eliminate as many as 275 of the 347 counts, could come as early
as today. Judge Ernest Tidwell, who will preside over the Atlanta trial
which begins on September 8, was informed of the change by prosecutors last
week.
Officials involved in the long-running BNL case say many of the charges
about to be dropped appear to relate to allegations that Mr Drogoul misled
the US government about the loans. If this is so, it would amount to a tacit
admission that at least some US government agencies had knowledge of the
Iraqi loans.
The BNL indictment, first brought in February 1991, charged Mr Drogoul with
false statements to bank regulators, money laundering, defrauding BNL's Rome
headquarters and misleading the US government.
The Justice Department has yet to address the issue of BNL loans being used
to fund US and European companies that contributed to Iraq's missile,
nuclear and chemical weapons projects.
Controversy has dogged the case for two years and Democratic allegations of
a cover-up by the Bush administration were made during last year's
presidential election campaign.
Former president George Bush recently received a subpoena from Mr Drogoul's
lawyers to testify in the trial.
In a related development, it has been learned that the US Federal Reserve,
which has re-opened its BNL investigation, is planning to question bank
officials in Rome next month.

NICARAGUAN troops, backed by helicopter gunships and armoured vehicles,
yesterday counter-attacked against rebels who seized control of a provincial
capital and barred the Pan- American highway on Wednesday.
Heavy fighting was reported to have killed 30 people and injured 70 in and
around the northern city of Estel. The fighting is the most serious
challenge to the authority of President Violeta Chamorro's government since
she took power from the left-wing Sandinistas in April 1990.
The rebel troops are left-wing veterans from the war in the 1980s when
US-backed Contras tried to overthrow the Sandinista government. They are led
by a former Sandinista major who commanded an elite counter-insurgency
battalion.
There is growing concern that if the army cannot regain control in the next
24 hours, further towns in the north will fall, and rioting might break out
in the capital and elsewhere. But, for the moment, the government has ruled
out state of emergency.
Calling themselves the Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Front (FROC),
the rebels are demanding finance for small farmers and craftsmen, and free
health and education and lifetime pensions for some 100,000 demobilised
troops. They also want to stop gold mines and sugar and banana plantations

THE US Justice Department is considering pursuing an anti-trust action
against Microsoft, the world's largest personal computer software company,
following failure of the federal trade commission to reach a decision on the
case after a three-year investigation.
On Wednesday the commission deadlocked 2-2 over whether to accept a staff
recommendation to issue an administrative complaint against the company -
the second time it has failed to agree on the case.
Ms Ann Bingaman, President Bill Clinton's new anti-trust chief at the
Justice Department, acknowledged interest in reviewing the case. Ms Bingaman
said she had not yet seen the Microsoft papers, but signalled that the
administration would take a tougher line on anti-trust issues than its
Republican predecessor.
'We plan to get pro-active looking at anti-competitive conduct,' she said.
The case stems from complaints by competitors that Microsoft uses
anti-competitive practices to achieve its dominant role in the market.
They allege that Microsoft has attempted to raise false concerns among
customers that its Windows program does not work properly with operating
system programs sold by competitors. There are also complaints that
Microsoft's program-licensing methods are designed to exclude competitors.
Microsoft expressed satisfaction at the outcome of the FTC meeting.
'The commission has investigated a number of complaints raised by Microsoft
competitors. We are gratified that, after an exhaustive and conscientious
review, the FTC has determined that these allegations, regarding Microsoft's
business practices, do not justify issuing an administrative complaint,'
said Mr William Neukom, Microsoft vice president of law and corporate
affairs.
Novell, Microsoft's chief competitor in the PC software market, emphasised
that the case remained open, and that no decision had been reached because
of the voting deadlock. Mr Neukom said the commission's vote should not be
characterised as deadlock. 'A motion was made to issue a complaint, the
motion failed.'
However, Commission insiders said the FTC refrained from closing the case to
allow for a trial if the Justice Department took up the matter.
Microsoft dismissed as a 'wild reach' suggestions that the Justice
Department would take up the case. 'It would amount to an admission by the
FTC that they are not capable of handling this kind of investigation,' said
Mr Neukom.
Nonetheless, both Microsoft and its competitors yesterday began intensive
lobbying of the justice department.

<TEXT>
THE backroom battles surrounding the election of a new president of the
European Bank for Reconstruction and Development reached new heights
yesterday.
The last-minute extension of the nomination period has plunged the bank into
a potentially damaging diplomatic battle in which the bargaining chips
include not only the EBRD presidency but also the location of the European
Central bank and a host of other top EC jobs.
Italian officials yesterday claimed that postponement of the deadline had
come at the initiative of Mr Jacques Delors, head of the EC Commission, who
sought to avoid a damaging row among the 12.
Although the bank itself insists that the decision to postpone for a week
was made by Mrs Anne Wibble, chairman of the board of governors, officials
within the bank yesterday admitted that the surprise entry of Mr Guiliano
Amato, the former socialist Italian prime minister, left the governors
embroiled in tortuous last-minute negotiations.
At present, the election for Mr Jacques Attali's successor contains four
confirmed candidates - Mr Jacques de Larosiere, governor of the bank of
France, Mr Amato, Mr Leszek Balcerowicz, former Polish finance minister and
Mr Henning Christopherson, EC economic commissioner.
Until Mr Amato entered the contest, Mr de Larosiere was regarded as the
leading contender. The French argued that since Mr Attali had been elected
for four years, a French candidate should succeed him, at least for the
re-maining two years of Mr Attali's term.
The Germans were widely believed to accept this, in exchange for agreement
that the European central bank would be sited in Frankfurt. The British, who
previously had French support in locating the EBRD in London, were
understood to pose no objection. And though other countries - particularly
the East Europeans - were less than happy at the apparent French fait
accompli, EC officials were keen that the Community should be seen to be
presenting a united front.
Last week European finance ministers agreed the Community should endorse one
candidate.
However, by yesterday it was clear that this attempt at unity was
foundering.
Although President Francois Mitterrand had asked Chancellor Helmut Kohl to
support the nomination of Mr de Larosiere as EBRD president during informal
talks in Germany last Tuesday, Mr Kohl did not commit himself, but instead
hinted that if Mr de Larosiere were to take over for the remaining two-year
term, preparations should also be made for putting into place a successor,
possibly Mr Amato.
Meanwhile, according to Italian officials, Mr Ciampi discussed with Mr Amato
his willingness to be considered for the EBRD job prior to the Tokyo summit,
and then sounded out Mr Kohl on the likelihood of an Italian candidate
obtaining sufficient consensus.
Faced with this last-minute manoeuvring, the governors decided to postpone
the deadline, apparently, according to bank officials, without the knowledge
of the bank's board of directors who met yesterday to discuss the recent
audit report.
Italian officials said the postponement would be used to hammer out
agreement on a common candidate endorsed by all EC members.
Mr Ciampi, the former governor of the Bank of Italy, feels strongly that his
country has been under-represented at the senior level in international
institutions.
This was not because of lack of opportunity but because successive
governments have never sought a protagonistic role in international affairs
and few Italians have volunteered for such jobs.
Which way Germany and the US jump in choosing Attali's successor will now be
crucial in the diplomatic battle.

Switzerland, the country's largest bank, on charges that its chairman, Mr
Nikolaus Senn, assisted political pay-offs to the Italian Socialist party,
writes Ian Rodger. UBS said it had received a letter from the commission
confirming that nothing improper or illegal had been done.

The Netherlands plans to liberalise its telecommunications infrastructure in
1995 by allowing the country's railway company, cable television companies
and electricity utilities to lease their lines and cables to business
customers, writes Ronald van de Krol in Amsterdam. The use of the lines will
be limited to data communication and to 'closed user' networks, as in the
case of internal communication between a company's offices around the
country.

The drive by Mr Felipe Gonzalez, the Spanish prime minister, to clean up his
Socialist party's image claimed its first victim yesterday when a leading
party figure resigned over his connections with a group of construction
companies, writes Tom Burns in Madrid.
The resignation of Mr Jose Maria Mohedano as secretary general of the
socialist parliamentary party has considerable novelty value in Spain, where
hitherto serious corruption allegations have had only limited political
consequences. Mr Mohedano said he had resigned in order not to 'damage the
party's image' and stressed that his conduct as a legal adviser to disgraced
real estate promotor, Mr Jose Luis Gomez-Pinto, had been strictly
professional.

RUSSIA'S parliament yesterday approved a new 1993 budget with a soaring
deficit that could wreck government efforts to control the money supply and
750 per cent annual inflation, Reuter reports from Moscow.
The parliament, with a free-spending reputation and packed with deputies
opposed to President Boris Yeltsin's reforms, relaxed the purse strings with
projected spending of Rbs44,700bn (Pounds 30bn).
This dwarfed expected revenues of Rbs22,300bn and will produce a deficit of
Rbs22,400bn, up from an earlier Rbs8,500bn target.
Parliament also passed a new law placing the central bank firmly under its
control.

FT  23 JUL 93 / Cagliari kept in jail a month without being questioned
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Gabriele Cagliari, the former chairman of Eni, the Italian state oil
concern, who committed suicide in his Milan prison cell on Tuesday, was kept
waiting at one stage during his imprisonment for a month without any
interrogation by magistrates.
This wait was revealed yesterday by Mr Giovanni Conso, the justice minister,
in a statement to the Senate on the circumstances surrounding Mr Cagliari's
death.
It immediately fuelled the debate over the magistrates' use and abuse of
their powers of detention. However, Mr Francesco Borelli, the Milan
attorney-general, rejected criticism that Mr Cagliari had been forgotten in
jail. He said during this time his evidence had been cross-checked and other
witnesses heard in connection with the cases.
Mr Cagliari was arrested on March 8 on charges of corruption and falsifying
accounts relating to a power station contract won by an Eni subsidiary. On
two subsequent occasions, on April 24 and May 26, further similar charges
were pressed relating to different episodes of corruption. According to Mr
Conso, the 67 year-old former Eni chairman was not questioned from June 15
to July 17.
In another development underscoring the judicial problems raised by the
nationwide corruption investigation, the appeal's court has settled an
acrimonious dispute between Milan and Rome magistrates. The dispute centred
on which set of magistrates exercised responsibility for a case of
corruption involving the ministry of posts and the allocation of television
licences.
The appeals court declared Rome had the authority because the bulk of the
investigation originated there. The row had earlier seen the magistrates
acting as rivals, with one person being apparently arrested on separate
occasions for a similar offence by both Milan and Rome.

FT  23 JUL 93 / Volkswagen's reply: Discovery of data seen as link with
ex-GM executive
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Excerpts from the statement issued by Volkswagen:
the investigation relates to documents which were not at the disposal of
Volkswagen AG.
2. Volkswagen AG cannot comment on details of the press release issued by
the Darmstadt Public Prosecutor's Office. Despite numerous requests to
inspect the contents of the boxes, to date the defence counsel of the
affected employee, who has again confirmed that no secret documents of Opel
AG or General Motors Corporation had been found in his possession, has been
denied access. The conduct of the Public Prosecutor's Office has thereby
prevented the employee from giving his views on the contents of the box.
Evidently the Public Prosecutor's Office can only base its assessment of the
contents of the boxes on information from Adam Opel AG/GM Corporation, which
makes it completely one-sided.
3. The comments of the Public Prosecutor's Office that Mr Lopez had part of
the documents translated into German is easily explained: managers who
operate on a global basis naturally have talks and presentations translated
into the local language.
The press release by the Public Prosecutor's Office does not give the
supervisory and management boards of VW any reason to reproach Mr Lopez.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE struggle between the Treuhand, the agency charged with privatising
eastern German industry, and hunger striking potash miners could influence
the pace of investment in eastern Germany, a government official said
yesterday.
The issue at stake is the future of Bischofferode potash mine in the eastern
state of Thuringia, where, for 23 days, 40 miners have been on hunger strike
in an attempt to prevent the mine closing.
The miners insist Bischofferode should not be sacrificed to facilitate the
merger of the potash industry in western and eastern Germany. The Treuhand
this month completed the merger of the east German Mitteldeutschen Kali
mines with its western counterpart, Kali + Salz, a subsidiary of BASF, in a
move to make the industry more competitive, reduce capacity, and at the same
time, save five of the remaining potash mines in eastern Germany.
Since then, 40 of the 700 miners at Bischofferode have been on hunger
strike, despite a recent compromise offer by the Treuhand, the federal
government and the authorities in Thuringia to keep the mine open until
December and guarantee the jobs for a further 2 1/2 years. The miners have
rejected this, saying they want the mine to be kept open permanently, even
though it is one of the most inefficient in the region.
Yesterday, following talks with miners' representatives, the Treuhand, the
chancellery and the government said the merger of Mitteldeutschen Kali and
Kali + Salz would go ahead, and the commitment to pay the workers at
Bischofferode until late 1995 would be honoured.
'There is a danger that the continuation of the hunger strike would worsen
the investment climate in a region where investment is urgently needed,'
said Mr Friedrich Bohl, Mr Helmut Kohl's chief of staff.
Government officials fear that if the Treuhand gives into the strikers'
demands, a precedent will be set for other miners to use the strike weapon
to prevent the closure of other unprofitable pits.
However, if one of the strikers were to die, opposition to the Treuhand's
plans to conclude the privatisation of the two giant brown coal fields at
both Mibrag and Laubag, as well as the energy sector, would increase.

Excerpts from the Darmstadt prosecutor's statement:
Investigative proceedings have now been opened, in addition to those against
Mr Lopez and Mr Gutierrez, against two other former employees of Opel AG who
also moved to VW.
On 22.06.93 four boxes of documents located in a property in Wiesbaden
Breckenheim were made available to. . . police. The two former employees of
Opel AG against whom preliminary proceedings have also been initiated, lived
there. In addition to papers the boxes contained files, overhead
transparencies and slides.
Examinations so far show that these are documents from Adam Opel and GM. In
the meantime, some of the documents have been evaluated and clarified by
extensive examination of witnesses. According to this it would seem that the
documents handed over contain data from the technical development centre of
Adam Opel and are also related to the small car project (O-car). These
documents were only available to top representatives of the management. The
documents included sales strategies, cost savings and information about the
new Vectra.
Some of the overhead projection transparencies and photographic slides were
(allegedly) assembled, and translated into German, at the express wish of Mr
Lopez. Investigation will continue, with special attention to witnesses from
VW.

FT  23 JUL 93 / Health service reforms hit drug sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DRUG sales in western Europe were virtually stagnant during the first five
months of the year, following health care reforms in Italy and Germany
earlier this year.
Sales to pharmacies in the seven largest markets in the five months to May
fell from Dollars 20.727bn (Pounds 13.8bn) last year to Dollars 19.422bn,
although after excluding exchange rate changes they increased 0.9 per cent,
according to IMS International, the London-based market research company.
That compares with 8 per cent growth for the whole of last year. The seven
countries represent about 85 per cent of west European sales. The German
market fell from Dollars 5.797bn last year to Dollars 5.18bn after the
introduction of reforms in January. The decline in local currency terms was
11.1 per cent.
Italian sales were also affected by reforms which took effect in April.
Revenues dropped from Dollars 4.708bn last year to Dollars 3.704bn. In lira
terms, the fall was 1.8 per cent.
The French market, Europe's largest and the world's third biggest after the
US and Japan, continued to rise. Sales were up from Dollars 4.846bn to
Dollars 5.181bn, an increase of 6.5 per cent in local currency. Modest
health care reforms are in the process of being implemented and a more
comprehensive package is expected next year.
The growth of the UK market continued, up 11.6 per cent in local currency
terms, although in dollar terms it fell from Dollars 2.162bn to Dollars
2.045bn. A package is expected to be introduced to control the increase in
the UK's national health service drugs bill.
Spanish sales continued to grow fast, up 13.6 per cent excluding exchange
rate factors, but down in dollar terms from Dollars 2.017bn to Dollars
1.996bn.
The largest therapeutic category remained cardiovascular medicines, although
this market fell by 3.1 per cent from Dollars 4.609bn to Dollars 4.201bn.
Doctors in Germany are understood to have been prescribing cheaper heart
drugs.
Sales of alimentary and metabolism treatments, which include anti-ulcer
drugs, increased 0.1 per cent excluding exchange rates, although in dollar
terms they declined from Dollars 3.497bn to Dollars 3.262bn.
In local currency terms, sales of central nervous system medicines were up
3.9 per cent, antibiotics and anti-virals rose 8.8 per cent.
The EC formally agreed yesterday to set up an agency to manage a new scheme
for authorising medicines in the EC single market. The European Agency for
the Evaluation of Medicinal Products is set to begin work on January 1 1995,
but only if EC leaders have agreed on a headquarters site. Contenders
include the UK, Denmark, Ireland and the Netherlands.

<TEXT>
INTERNATIONAL mediators Lord Owen and Thorvald Stoltenberg yesterday
postponed peace talks in Geneva until Sunday following intense Serb
bombardments of Sarajevo and other enclaves in Bosnia.
Mr Alija Izetbegovic, Moslem president of Bosnia, earlier yesterday said he
could not attend peace talks while his capital was under attack.
'Unfortunately, up to this moment, there are no signs that attacks are
diminishing,' he said in a letter to the peace envoys. 'The offensive around
Sarajevo also is not diminishing. As I am writing this letter, the city is
being intensely shelled.'
The Serbs renewed their barrage early yesterday morning from positions on
the hills surrounding the city, UN officials said. They also reported return
fire from the besieged Bosnian defenders.
At the same time, Serb forces were stepping up attacks on Brcko,
north-eastern Bosnia, in a push to widen their land corridors running across
northern Bosnia and linking Serbia with Serb-held territory. In his letter,
referring to Serb attacks on Brcko, Mr Izetbegovic said 'surface-to-surface
missiles have been used today, which is a new negative element. Casualties
and damage are enormous.'
UN monitors yesterday confirmed reports that regular units of the Croatian
army were fighting across the Bosnian frontier in Mostar, the south-western
city. The UN Security Council and the European Community have repeatedly
warned Croatia it could face punitive sanctions, like neighbouring Serbia,
if it continued to back the violent carve-up of Bosnia.
Croatia, in particular its powerful defence minister Gojko Susak, who
controls Croat policy in Bosnia, has so far ignored international warnings
and denied that Croatia has despatched its troops. Bosnian radio reported
two battalions of the Croatian army was fighting in Mostar reinforcing the
Croatian Defence Council in its attempt to seize control of the area and
expel tens of thousands of Moslems from the city.
The postponement of the talks is not likely to improve the position of Mr
Izetbegovic, who has been under pressure to come to the negotiating table
for talks on the republic's three-way ethnic partition.

BUSINESS confidence is improving among German managers, who see the
recession as bottoming out, according to a report by Ifo, the Munich
economic institute.
The study, which each month questions 500 managers in Germany's largest
companies, says the business community is now less pessimistic over
prospects for the German economy. An increasing number of businessmen think
that economic activity has reached its lowest level and will not decline
further in the next six months, the report says.
Industrial orders in June remained at the same level as the previous month,
arresting this year's downward trend. However, Ifo notes that production
cuts will continue as German industry faces low domestic demand and
continuing restructuring.
The report says unsold stocks remain high and businessmen expect prices to
fall in coming months.
The outlook differs in various sectors of the economy. In the chemical
sector, export-driven growth is expected because of the strong dollar.
Machinery producers remain pessimistic about the domestic market but also
say that export possibilities will increase in coming months. Similar views
are expressed in the motor industry.
Exceptions are found in the construction industry and in retailing in
western Germany, but their counterparts in the east say business is picking
up and are optimistic over the future market potential.

FT  23 JUL 93 / Probe of VW officers widens: Discovery of data seen as link
with ex-GM executive
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
CRIMINAL investigations into alleged industrial spying by top Volkswagen
executives have been intensified after the discovery of copies of
confidential General Motors data.
Prosecutors in Darmstadt have widened the probe into possible links between
Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, who defected from GM to become a VW
director in March, and the data found in a Wiesbaden house.
Mr Lopez, head of group purchasing and production, is at the centre of
investigations which now involve two former occupants of the house, Mr Jorge
Alvarez Aguirre and Mr Ramon Piazza. Both men are ex-GM employees who
followed Mr Lopez to VW on March 22, after he abruptly left the US group on
March 15.
The announcement of the wider investigations came yesterday from Mr Georg
Nauth, a senior public prosecutor in Darmstadt. Responding to Mr Nauth, VW
issued a statement headlined 'No documents found in Wolfsburg' - the
company's headquarters.
The response was the second in two days in which the company appeared to
distance itself from the employees under investigation. It said the
documents had not been found 'at the disposal' of Volkswagen. Four boxes
found in the Wiesbaden house contained documents, overhead projection slides
and transparencies from Adam Opel, GM's German subsidiary, and the US
parent, according to the prosecutor's statement. Some of the data allegedly
related to Opel's secret small car project, code-named the O-Car. Other
information concerned sales strategies, cost-cutting plans and the Vectra
model.
Some of the slides and transparencies had been translated into German at the
express wish of 'the accused' - Mr Lopez - the statement added.
The prosecutor claimed that, while still head of global purchasing at GM,
having already discussed moving to VW with Mr Ferdinand Piech, the German
group's chairman, Mr Lopez asked for translations from English of around 150
slides containing details of purchasing and manufacturing plans. Their
discovery in the former home of the two former Opel managers, both of whom
now work for VW and have denied having documents, is the link with Mr Lopez
which the Darmstadt prosecutors said they were seeking.
In its response to the prosecutor's statement VW complained that the lawyer
defending 'the affected employee', who 'had again confirmed that no secret
Opel or GM documents had been found in his possession', had not been allowed
to see the papers.
The prosecutor's statement gave VW no reason to reproach Mr Lopez, it said.
Earlier this week VW claimed that a civil court ruling in a separate but
associated case concerned individuals while they were still employed by GM,
and was 'not Volkswagen's concern'.

THE European Commission yesterday took action over more than Dollars 200m
(Pounds 133m) of state aid to industries in Italy and Austria.
In separate decisions, the Commission recommended withdrawal of favourable
EC tariffs for two motor plants and a television factory in Austria,
involving General Motors, Steyr Nutzfahrzeuge, and Grundig respectively.
It also banned payment of Dollars 120m of Italian government subsidies to
Cartiere de Garda, a paper company in northern Italy owned by Bertelsmann,
the German publishing empire.
The Commission's decisions reflect the tough line on state aid adopted by Mr
Karel Van Miert, the Belgian commissioner responsible for competition
policy. In the Austrian cases, the Commission made clear that it could
soften its stance if Vienna cut subsidies.

FT  23 JUL 93 / Christian Democrats seek path to salvation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE fate of Italy's discredited Christian Democrat party will be decided at
a four-day special assembly starting today.
Devastated by the nationwide corruption scandals, divided by internal
squabbles and flabby from 45 years enjoying the spoils of state, the party
faces further fragmentation unless it can incorporate the best of its
Catholic traditions in a new reformist party.
The party may, however, be beyond recovering its electoral appeal and
traditional role in the centre of the Italian political spectrum.
With the encroachment of the populist Lombard League in the north and the
continued strength of the former communist party of the Democratic Left
(PDS) in central Italy, the Christian Democrats will have to fight hard to
remain a national party. The party also has to find a raison d'etre to
replace its traditional cold war role as an anti-communist alliance. On the
economic front, the party swings between free market aims and nostalgia for
a strong state presence, summed up by the slogan at the assembly: 'No to
state capitalism but no to capitalism without the state.'
Invitations to the assembly have been carefully vetted. All parliamentarians
who have received notice from magistrates for alleged corruption and other
serious crimes have been excluded. This has effectively disqualified the old
party barons. Mr Giulio Andreotti, active in the formation of the party in
1942, and the Christian Democrat politician who has held office the most,
has not been invited.
Mr Mario Segni, leader of the referendum movement who three months ago left
the party after 16 years, has been invited but declined to attend.
In all there will be 45 deputies, 15 senators and 10 European MPs, plus
special guests. The main confrontation is expected to be between Mr Mino
Martinazzoli, the party leader since October 1992, and Ms Rosi Bindi, the
deputy from the Veneto. Mr Martinazzoli sees the party as a leaner
organisation aiming for the centre ground, redefining its role with the
church but remaining strongly Catholic and Liberal/Social Democratic in
political inspiration.
Ms Bindi claims the party has failed to clean itself up quickly enough and
remains too influenced by the old guard. Aware of the success of the League
in her home territory, she sees a new 'popular party inspired by Christian
ideals whose priority is beating the League'. But in areas such as Naples or
Rome, where the League does not count, such a strategy is too narrowly
focused.
She has already formed in the Veneto a Popular party (a party of this name
was dissolved by Mussolini in 1926 but provided the inspiration for the
Christian Democrats) and is ready to go her own way. If she does, the
Christian Democrats will either splinter or become more regionally rooted.

THE European Commission yesterday acted on more than Dollars 200m (Pounds
133m) of state aid to industries in Italy and Austria.
In separate decisions, the Commission recommended the withdrawal of
favourable EC tariffs for two motor plants and a television factory in
Austria, involving General Motors, Steyr Nutzfahrzeuge, and Grundig

The Commission's decisions reflect the tough line on state aid adopted by Mr
Karel van Miert, the Belgian commissioner responsible for competition
policy. In the Austrian cases, the Commission made clear that it could
soften its recommendation to the Council of Ministers if Austria responded
by offering to cut subsidies.
The Austrian decisions are controversial because they come in the middle of
negotiations on accession to the EC. The cases all involve products which
are competing with EC industries.
State aid amounting to 15 per cent (Ecu48.9m) of an Ecu324.2m (Pounds 245m)
investment in a General Motors Austria plant making cylinder heads and
gearboxes at a plant at Aspern, near Vienna.
A 15.1 per cent subsidy (Ecu24.3m) for rationalisation and extension of a
plant making heavy vehicles at Steyr, most of which would be exported to the
EC. The total investment is valued at Ecu162.9m.
State aid amounting to 10 per cent (Ecu7.25m) for an Ecu72.5m investment for
rationalising production of television sets at a Grundig plant in Vienna.
The Commission decision on the Cartiere case followed comments from the
French, German and British governments, a British paper manufacturer and an
Austrian industrial federation.

FT  23 JUL 93 / Yugoslav government devalues dinar by more than 80 per cent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Yugoslav government yesterday devalued the dinar by more than 80 per
cent to help deal with a sanctions-related economic slump and soaring
inflation, Reuter reports.
The new rate was set at 13.6m dinar per dollar, up from 2.4m. That
represents a fall of 82.35 per cent in the dinar's value against the US
currency and it was the eighth dinar reduction since April 1992. The deputy
prime minister, Mr Jovan Zebic, announced the devaluation shortly after the
flourishing black market exchange rate for the dollar peaked at 15.5m
dinars, around 12 times more than the largely meaningless official rate.

FT  23 JUL 93 / Ship of state shudders on day of destiny
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT WAS a moment of history. Labour MPs punched the air and shouted 'hold the
front page' to the Commons press gallery even before the final vote was
announced.
The government defeated, Mr John Major tried to look dignified as he sat,
ready to read from the sheet of paper he had already placed on the despatch
box.
His attempts to conjure an image of serene determination had been shattered
like a still pond hit by a boulder. The prime minister had tried to see
Maastricht as a determined swan, inexorably drifting towards ratification.
It was a day for a spot of fishing or baiting the opposition parties, he
implied.
But beneath the surface, government business managers paddled frantically to
stop the ship sinking. Even an understanding - if not quite a deal - with
the nine Ulster Unionist MPs was not enough.
Last night, as the cabinet met for the third time in a day, Downing Street
officials were playing the ultimate card - the threat of a general election.
The drama had lasted all day. Cabinet ministers met; the whips began their
calculations. On the terrace at lunchtime, it was jolly weather for messing
about with votes.
By afternoon a shaft of July sun through the high windows of the Commons'
chamber turned the prime minister's grey hair to a bright silver as he
opened the defence for the government.
On the benches opposite sat the menacing figure of Mr James Molyneaux,
Ulster Unionist leader, and - in an eagle's nest position in the gallery -
the bespectacled Mr James Cran, a Tory Eurosceptic ring-leader.
As rational debate turned to fractious political point-scoring, it was clear
the plot was being hatched elsewhere. Mr Richard Ryder, the chief whip, was
not in his usual seat; Mr Molyneaux held his order papers to his lips as he
conferred with colleagues.
At first, Tory Eurosceptics were confident. Later their song changed. 'The
social chapter is difficult for some of our boys to vote for,' admitted one.
By evening, as Mr Major gave his end-of-term pep talk to the 1922 Committee,
there was loud desk-thumping. Later news of an emergency cabinet meeting
triggered deep Tory fears that his appeal to loyalty would not be enough.
As the 10pm vote approached, government whips raced along Westminster
corridors, Tory Eurosceptics gathered. The nine Ulster Unionist MPs enjoyed
a rare burst of publicity. 'I am always delighted to accept a sinner
returning home,' Mr Major said as Mr John Carlisle renounced his Euro-rebel
links.
With his meek grin and the air of a man staking his political reputation on
the Commons' eventually backing him, the prime minister might have chosen
words direct from the Old Testament: 'Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we
die.'

FT  23 JUL 93 / Major stakes all on confidence vote: Humiliating defeat for
prime minister - Tory rebels deal blow over Maastricht treaty
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR last night staked the government's future on ratification of
the Maastricht treaty by threatening a general election unless the House of
Commons supports him in a confidence motion later today.
The dramatic decision, endorsed by an emergency meeting of the full cabinet
after a day of anguish for the government at Westminster, followed a
humiliating defeat over the treaty's social chapter.
Last night senior ministers were confident of victory but there was
widespread acknowledgement that Mr Major's political authority had been
further undermined.
It is the only confidence motion tabled by the government - rather than by
the Labour opposition - during the Conservatives' uninterrupted term of
office since 1979 and one of only a handful in modern political history. It
represents Mr Major's last chance to remain as prime minister.
Despite dire warnings, a total of 23 Conservative MPs joined opposition
parties to deny the government the votes it needed to ratify finally the
Maastricht treaty with its social chapter opt-out.
But, as Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, tabled an amendment to today's
confidence motion to force the government to embrace the social chapter,
most of the rebels indicated they would not oppose the government again.
The defeat forced Mr Major to table a confidence resolution for debate later
today which also demands the authority to ratify the treaty with Britain's
opt-out from the social provisions intact. Senior ministers, including Mr
Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, immediately warned that if the government
lost it would resign, obliging the Queen to call an election which would
almost certainly result in a Labour victory.
Amid scenes of fury in the Commons chamber and in the lobbies of
Westminster, Mr Clarke and other cabinet members dismissed as 'fantasy' any
suggestion that Mr Major would resign but the government would survive under
another prime minister, if the motion was lost.
The ministers conceded that the vote was the 'last throw of the dice' in Mr
Major's efforts to end the year-long civil war in the Tory party over
Maastricht. But they voiced optimism that the rebels would be forced into
line and the prime minister would survive.
After a day of high drama, Mr Major managed to fight off the Labour party
amendment which might have obliged him to abandon the social chapter
opt-out.
Amid extraordinary scenes of government anger and opposition elation, MPs
were first tied at 317 votes to 317 votes on the Labour amendment. Miss
Betty Boothroyd, the Speaker, then gave her casting vote to the government.
But an alliance of opposition parties and dissident Tory MPs rejected by 324
to 316 the government's call for the authority to press ahead with
ratification.
The switchback voting, which saw hardcore Conservative Euro-sceptics join
with the opposition parties against the prime minister, left a
constitutional stalemate.
The government defeat - which saw 15 Conservative Euro-sceptics lining up
against it in the first vote and 23 in the second as well as a number of
abstentions - came despite an apparent deal struck by the government to win
the support of nine Ulster Unionist MPs.
Ministers appear to have offered the Unionists assurances of the
government's commitment to maintaining Northern Ireland's position in the UK
and to promoting democracy in the province.
Facing opposition calls for his resignation, Mr Major read from a prepared
statement to demand that MPs pass a resolution: 'This House has confidence
in her Majesty's government on the adoption of the protocol on social policy
provisions.'
The legislation enacted earlier this week to give force to the treaty says
the government cannot finally ratify it until MPs have decided one way or
another on whether they want the government to scrap the social opt-out.
The votes came after a day which saw Mr Major and his cabinet colleagues
make a series of desperate but vain pleas to Tory rebels to end the bitter
struggle over Europe which has drained the prime minister's authority.
Some of the Euro-sceptics returned to the government fold to reject the
Labour demand for incorporation of the social chapter but enough continued
to defy the prime minister to deny him victory.
Mr Major earlier issued an unequivocal warning that he was ready to defy the
Commons if it had voted for the social chapter. Accusing his opponents of
cynicism and political opportunism, the prime minister said that failure to
ratify Maastricht would destroy British influence within the European
Community.
In a passionate and emotional debate which saw Mr Smith accuse the
government of creating a 'sweatshop economy' in Britain by rejecting the
social chapter, Mr Major told the Tory rebels that whatever the outcome they
would not wreck the entire treaty.
Mr Smith challenged the prime minister immediately after the vote, accusing
him of using a confidence vote to exclude Britain from the benefits of the
social chapter because he could not win on any other basis.
Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, warned that his party would
continue to oppose the government. But ministers appeared confident that
they could continue to rely on the support of the Ulster Unionists.

FT  23 JUL 93 / Victory may not heal shattered authority
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
He will win today. But at what cost?
As MPs poured from the Commons chamber after last night's government defeat
Mr John Major's cabinet colleagues spoke as one. It was not the prime
minister's future on the line in today's confidence vote. It was the
government's.
The ever-gregarious chancellor, Mr Kenneth Clarke, held forth to
journalists, explaining again and again that the only alternative to victory
was a general election. The strategy had been agreed by the whole cabinet.
Mr Clarke, the heir apparent to the leadership, was ready to go down in
flames with his neighbour.
The warning to the Tory Eurosceptics who have fought beyond all expectation
to wreck the treaty was crystal clear. Defy Mr Major again and you will get
a Labour government. You will get also a treaty with, not without, the
socialist social chapter. In the clamour someone even suggested that
September 2 had been pencilled in as the election date.
The sceptics took the point. An MP who had just defied his party for the
umpteenth time admitted defeat. He would back Mr Major. Maastricht would be
ratified.
Others die-hards who have forged a party within a party - the Conservatives'
very own Militant Tendency - agreed. A handful might fight to the end - up
to a half a dozen might conceivably court expulsion from their own party -
but not enough to topple the government.
But there was another, reluctant, consensus among many of those who gathered
to vilify the Tory rebels and reflect on their government's future. A
victory today will not be enough to restore Mr Major's shattered authority.
It may in the end prove impossible to repair.
Nor will the ultimate sanction heal the deep schism opened up by more than a
year of civil war over Europe. Some Tories wondered whether the party is now
ungovernable.
More than 20 backbenchers voted against Mr Major despite the fiercest
campaign in recent political history to force them into line. Another 20
would have liked to join them. Thirty or 40 more would refuse privately to
condemn the rebels.
A confidence motion can be used once, but Mr Major cannot threaten to take
his party beyond the brink again. Next time, he would be forced to stand
down.
It will take more than today's vote to restore the Conservative party's will
to govern and to rebuild Mr Major's leadership. Fair or not, he does not
command enough respect in his party to be certain of his future.
Mr Major thinks otherwise. He insists the breathing space provided by the
summer parliamentary recess might provide time for the economic recovery and
the feel-good factor to refloat his battered, stumbling administration.
Perhaps it will. But early today amid the anguish of defeat few Tories would
bet on it.

FT  23 JUL 93 / Support for franc as ERM faces turmoil
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING, PETER JOHN and STEPHANIE FLANDERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS,, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESSURE on the European exchange rate mechanism intensified yesterday as
the Bundesbank intervened heavily to support the French franc while the
Spanish, Portuguese and Danish currencies slid down the ERM currency grid.
The franc held its ground, hovering just over a centime above its ERM floor
and closing at FFr3.418 against the D-Mark. In late trading in New York it
was at around FFr3.4085.
The Bank of France did not confirm reports that it was buying francs to prop
up the currency, but Mr Christopher Potts, economist at Banque Indosuez in
Paris, estimated that the bank had spent up to DM10bn (Pounds 3.8bn)
yesterday in its attempts to support the currency.
The peseta, which only recently was at the top of the European monetary
system ladder, crashed through its ERM central rate of Pta79.11 to reach new
lows against the D-Mark, before closing at Pta79.84. In New York it was
around Pta79.65. The escudo closed in Europe at 100.25 against the D-Mark,
having begun the week at 97.10. In New York it was around 99.94.
The Danish krone appeared in danger in early trading yesterday but recovered
to close in London at DKr3.8805 against the D-Mark.
Market attention focused on the franc, however, prompting the French central
bank to take a significant step against speculators by suspending its five
to 10 day lending facility, replacing it with overnight funds at the same
7.75 per cent interest rate.
The decision will make it more difficult for speculators to borrow francs
with the intention of selling and repurchasing them more cheaply after any
devaluation.
The French authorities also suspended the facility in January. The overnight
interest rate was then raised by 2 per cent. Currency analysts said that the
battle against the franc had entered a new and more serious stage. 'Until
now it has been something of a phoney war,' said Mr Potts at Banque
Indosuez. 'Today, for the first time we have seen very heavy selling
pressure.'
Mr Edmond Alphandery, the French economy minister, yesterday reaffirmed the
government's commitment to the franc's current ERM parity.
In an interview published in Le Figaro, he said: 'The markets have to
understand that our determination is total.
'The priority is monetary stability. The cornerstone is the maintenance of
the parity between the franc and the D-Mark.'
Yesterday's move by the French central bank was seen as just one step in the
defence of the franc.

FT  23 JUL 93 / Major ready to defy Commons on social chapter: Prime
minister calls emergency cabinet meeting before crucial vote
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR last night staked his administration's future on ratification
of the Maastricht treaty with an unequivocal warning that he was ready to
defy the House of Commons if it voted for the social chapter.
In a stormy, angry debate as MPs prepared for last night's crucial votes on
whether Britain should accept the treaty's social provisions, Mr Major said
nothing would deflect him from ratification of the treaty. But with the
outcome still on a knife-edge, the prime minister was forced to summon an
emergency cabinet meeting to discuss the options in the event of a defeat.
Accusing his opponents of cynicism and political opportunism, the prime
minister said that failure to ratify Maastricht would destroy British
influence within the European Community.
Conservative party managers last night were still struggling to secure
endorsement of Britain's social chapter opt-out with a combination of
blatant arm-twisting, backstairs bargaining and passionate pleading.
But with the Ulster Unionists still wavering, no one was confident of a
government victory. There was speculation that the cabinet was considering
offering them a series of concessions, including the creation of a Commons
committee with the right to look at security in the province.
Mr Major sought to step up the pressure on Tory opponents of the treaty with
an impassioned plea for loyalty and unity at a packed meeting of the
backbench 1922 committee only hours before MPs were due to vote.
He warned that imposition of the social chapter would risk aborting the
economic recovery now underway, driving out British businesses and jobs to
overseas competitors and undermining the flow of overseas investment in the
UK.
The prime minister told the Tory rebels that whatever the outcome they would
fail in their attempts to wreck the entire treaty.
Dismissing suggestions that he might be forced to embrace the social
chapter, he said the enactment earlier this week of the European Communities
(Amendment) bill had provided the authority for ratification of the original
treaty. He added: 'Rarely in recent history has parliament shown its will so
effectively. Today's debate is an attempt to frustrate that will.'
His comments - signalling his readiness to defy the alliance of opposition
parties and Tory Eurosceptics ranged against him - provoked outrage and
warnings of a constitutional crisis from opposition leaders.
Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, accused Mr Major of threatening to ride
roughshod over the will of parliament, warning that the social chapter
opt-out would turn Britain into the 'sweatshop of Europe'.
But Mr Major said that yesterday's debate had no relevance to the
ratification process: 'Parliament is no longer debating the Maastricht
treaty. The bill is now an act. In due course the treaty will be ratified'.
Emphasising that Britain could not renege on its commitments, he told MPs:
'If we wilfully throw away our capacity to defend our interests and promote
our policies in that (European) market, I believe this country will pay a
dear price for that folly in the years to come.'
Major urges Tory rebels to think again, Page 7

FT  22 JUL 93 / International Company News: IRI gains breathing space with
tax-credit windfall of L2,000bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IRI, Italy's biggest state holding company which has total group debts of
about L73,000bn (Dollars 45.68bn), is set to receive around L2,000bn in
unpaid tax credits.
The funds, part of a L3,500bn package of tax credits being reimbursed to
various companies, should give the group a breathing space pending further
restructuring and asset sales.
The IRI group lost L4,809bn after tax last year. Losses at many operations -
notably Ilva (steel) and Iritecna (construction and general contracting) -
have continued to rise, while expected privatisation receipts have so far
fallen behind schedule. As a result, the group expects to lose about
L5,200bn in 1993.
Details of which companies would receive the tax credits were due to be
announced last night following cabinet approval this week for a decree
authorising repayment.
The L3,500bn represents the second tranche of L7,500bn in tax credits
authorised to be paid last March. About L4,000bn of the total has already
been allocated.
IRI has already raised about L1,000bn this year by selling the dividends and
tax credits on shares in some of its profitable subsidiaries over the next
three years. Further funds are due from the sale of the Italgel and Cirio,
Bertolli, De Rica subsidiaries of its SME foods unit.
However, the timing on the SME disposals has already slipped substantially,
and may fall further behind the original schedule.
A court in Naples, SME's legal base, has still to approve the outcome of a
special shareholders' meeting last month which authorised splitting the
company - a vital step to privatisation.
The delay means the deadline for final offers for the two subsidiaries on
sale, which has already been postponed to July 26, may have to be put back
further.
Finanziaria Ernesto Breda, the holding company controlling the defence
activities of the state-owned Efim group, now in voluntary liquidation,
yesterday revised its 1992 loss to L589.3bn from L539.3bn, barely a month
after approving the original figure.
The revision follows new information, which only came to the attention of
FEB's board this week, about possible difficulties recovering funds due from
the L255bn sales in 1991 of stakes in two defence subsidiaries.

<TEXT>
LEIF HOEGH, one of Norway's biggest shipowners, yesterday announced
first-half pre-tax profits up sharply to NKr471m (Dollars 64.45m) from
NKr120m in the same period last year.
The improvement was helped by a NKr258m gain from the disposal of assets, a
stronger dollar, improved markets for tankers and dry bulk carriers, and
lower interest payments. Mr Olav Geir Foss, director, forecast full-year
pre-tax profits of about NKr400m, up from NKr278m in 1992.
Earlier, the shipowner forecast operating profit in 1993 would rise to about
NKr350m from NKr309m in 1992.
Mr Foss said the value of the group's share and bond portfolios had also
increased.
Group freight revenue in the period rose to NKr1.21bn from NKr1.08bn as
operating profit increased to NKr176m from NKr161m. Bona Shipholding, the
group's tanker and dry bulk carrier operation, boosted first half operating
profit to NKr67m from NKr21m.
The advance was attributed to stable freight rates for oil products from
North Africa to Europe and the US, and to higher rates for dry bulk cargoes
such as grain, coal and phosphates.
The group's car-carrier operation saw operating profit decline to NKr115m
from NKr128m, mostly because of the disposal of two vessels and a weaker
trend in the market.

FT  22 JUL 93 / International Company News: Saab sees possible return to
profitability next year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
SAAB Automobile, launching its all-important 900 model, said yesterday it
saw the possibility of a return to profit next year for the first time since
General Motors of the US bought a half-share in the company in 1989.
Mr Keith Butler-Wheelhouse, the Briton brought in by GM last year to head
Sweden's traditional rival to Volvo, declined to make a firm forecast,
warning that the gloomy outlook in world car markets, especially in Europe,
where sales have slumped 17 per cent this year, continued to cloud Saab's
prospects.
But, he added, 'I prefer to say that we have brought down the break-even
point for the company to about 80,000 units sold per year and we intend to
sell significantly more than that next year. So if nothing else changes we
should be in the black next year.'
Mr Butler-Wheelhouse acknowledged that the success of the new 900, which
will compete against the Mercedes C class, the BMW 3-series and the Audi 80,
was vital for Saab, which in the past four years has accumulated losses of
more than SKr10bn (Dollars 1.25bn) and swallowed a further SKr8bn in two
capital injections by GM and its Swedish co-owner, Saab-Scania.
He insisted that Saab was not in a 'do or die' position. He said even if
sales did not hit the high levels Saab hoped for, the company had the funds
and the support of GM and Saab-Scania to continue to develop its next new
model, an upgrade of the luxury 9000 car, due within five years.
Mr John Fleming, marketing chief, said Saab had set a sales target of 45,000
cars in the first year for the 900. The new car is a complete re-vamp of the
old 900 based on many Opel/Vauxhall components but with a distinctive body
styling and additional engineering to give it a clear Saab identity.
Saab said the new model cost SKr4.5bn and took 3 1/2 years to develop.
Savings from the link with GM were put at 30 per cent. Mr Fleming said the
car would be priced slightly below its main rivals.
The chief worry for Saab is the steep decline in its main markets. It sold
only 35,800 cars in first half of the year, compared with 86,800 in all of
1992 and 109,500 in 1989. Sales in the US - its biggest market - and Europe
were down nearly 30 per cent. In Sweden, Saab is battling against a slump
which has seen overall car sales fall from a peak of 340,000 in 1988 to an
expected 130,000 this year.
The 900 will sell hard on Saab's commitment to safety and low exhaust
emissions as well as performance. In Sweden cars will be fitted with a
'black box' to record vital data in crashes, an idea widely canvassed in the
UK.
The two-litre turbo model, one of four engine types ranging from a
two-litre, four-cylinder standard engine up to a 2.5-litre V6, will offer a
so-called 'sensonic' automatic clutch operating by touching the gear lever.

FT  22 JUL 93 / Russian truck maker plans modernisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD

   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
KAMAZ, Russia's main supplier of trucks, has embarked on a modernisation
programme to boost its competitiveness in the world truck market, according
to Mr Nikolai Bekh, the company's general director.
The programme will include the purchase of up to 100,000 truck engines from
foreign companies to make up for a shortfall following a fire at the
company's main engine plant in April. The 230,000 engine-a-year capacity
plant, in the city of Naberezhnie Chelnyin in the Russian republic of
Tatarstan, was destroyed, with damage estimated up to Dollars 1bn.
Mr Bekh said the fire, which wrecked not just the plant but also Kamaz's
plan to increase production by 25 per cent, did allow the management to
start from scratch in developing a new strategy for the truck business.
A new plant is now being built at a cost of Dollars 150m plus Rbs20bn; it
will produce 100,000 engines a year and should be completed by the end of
1993. However, up to 100,000 engines must be imported to produce the new
trucks for which there is now an enormous pent-up demand.
Mr Bekh denied a story in a Moscow newspaper yesterday that a deal was about
to be signed with Mercedes for the supply of 25,000 engines at a cost of
Dollars 300m. 'It's only a proposal,' he said.
Mr Bekh said the average cost of a truck engine made in the west was too
high and made the outright purchase of such a large number impossible for
the company. However, he has proposed three possibilities for solving the
problems.
First, the government would itself buy 25,000 engines abroad, which Kamaz
would then put into the trucks which have been made but await engines.
Second, the government could sell oil to Kamaz at domestic prices, and let
the company sell it abroad at world prices, using the difference to buy
engines.
Third, the government could sell hard currency to Kamaz at one tenth of the
present market rate - just over Rbs1,000 to the dollar.
Mr Bekh, one of the most prominent of Russia's younger industrialists, said
the new strategy now being pushed through at his enterprises would result in
the production of trucks 'of a world class'. In collaboration with a group
of foreign companies, including the long-time associates Cummins Engines and
Rockwell International, the company is revamping the chassis, braking
systems and cab design of the ageing models still being produced.

FT  22 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: Dunhill falls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A profits warning from Dunhill, the luxury goods and tobacco group, sent the
shares reeling and also impacted on Rothmans. Dunhill chairman Lord Douro
told the agm that a 'convincing recovery' would be now needed in markets
such as Japan to avoid a significant reduction in the company's operating
profits this year. The recovery under way in the UK and US was described as
being 'only hesitant'.
Dunhill shares closed 17 down at 340p. Rothmans fell 10 to 670p. On a
brighter note, shareholders learnt that plans to restructure Dunhill,
Rothmans and Richemont to create the Vendome luxury goods group are on
track, with meetings to vote on the proposals set for September.
Under the reconstruction, the three groups will split their tobacco and
luxury goods businesses into two new quoted companies, Vendome and Rothmans.
International trading group Hanson shed a penny to 234p after the company
said the strike at its Peabody mining subsidiary would cost Pounds 29m for
the three months to the end of June.
Lonrho firmed 1 1/2 to 130 1/2 p after the group said it had agreed the sale
of its 50 per cent stake in German metals trading concern Krupp Lonrho for
DM282.5m. The company said the proceeds were to be used to reduce debt.
Brokers' recommendations helped BAT Industries shake off Tuesday's gloom
that led to a retreat after Philip Morris, its US rival, confirmed that
provisional price cuts made earlier this year were to be extended to other
premium brands.
The shares bounced 7 to 437p in trade of 4.4m, with both NatWest Securities
and Strauss Turnbull said to be positive on the stock.
Among oil issues, volume in Lasmo jumped to 10m after a series of agency
crosses during the afternoon. The day's turnover included two large crosses
at 135 1/2 p, and a smaller block of around 500,000 that was dealt at 138p.
The shares continued to recover and closed 3 1/2 up at 137 1/2 p.
In the rest of the oil sector, fears of an oil glut continued to dampen
enthusiasm for Shell Transport, which slipped a further 5 to 603p. However,
bargain hunters lifted British Petroleum into positive territory and it
closed a penny firmer at 288p after trade of 5.8m shares.
A positive rating upgrade by a UK stockbroker helped Cable and Wireless rise
sharply in early trade before the shares faded away to close unchanged at
759p. BZW added Pounds 20m to its current year forecast, lifting it to
Pounds 1.035bn, and attributed this to strong trading in its key markets.
Slight disappointment at the lack of trading news at Vodafone's annual
meeting left the shares 7 cheaper at 436p.
The recommendation from Lehman Brothers made earlier this week continued to
boost Reuters ahead of next week's figures. The shares moved 16 higher to
1408p.
Container rental group Tiphook dropped another 16 to 197p as dealers
continued to fret about the company's financial position. Tiphook announced
losses last week after changing the way it reported its figures.
National Express moved forward 8 to 223p after confirming its planned
acquisition of East Midlands Airport. The company, however, warned that its
coach operating business was trading below expectations following a poor
response to fare changes and aggressive pricing by British Rail.
Agm talk of an improving trend, albeit tempered by some concern over
international economic prospects, left Pilkington a penny easier at 131p.
Pre-results nerves bit into Reed International, which lost 6 to close at
640p. The company is due to declare its interims in a fortnight's time.
Anglo-Dutch foods group Unilever advanced, helped by a BZW buy note, before
fading to finish 2 down on balance at 947p.
Continued worries about the funding of British Aerospace's regional jets
joint venture with Taiwan further depressed BAe shares, which ended 12
weaker at 388p after volume of 1.8m.
Strong demand for VSEL ahead of today's annual meeting saw the shares
strengthen 27 to 890p.
Worse than expected figures at a US rival led to selling of shares in
engineering group Siebe, which finished 7 lighter at 485p but above the
day's worst.
A change of recommendation from Smith New Court from buy to hold in BICC
left the shares 8 down at 398p, while it was profit-taking that was said to
be responsible for a decline in Powell Duffryn of 10 to 541p.
Television stocks refused to bow to the market's malaise and turned in
creditable performances. Anglia TV was star of the show with an advance of
13 to 325p. It also benefited from a buy recommendation from NatWest
Securities - the only television stock to do so in an anaylst's note which
reported a slight increase in advertising revenue last month against
expectations of a small decline.
Central TV moved up 10 to 1958p; Grampian 'A' added 3 at 227p;
Yorkshire-Tyne Tees TV gained 3 at 198p and Scottish TV put on 2 at 516p.
Carlton Communications was the only stock to slip, relinquishing 5 to 730p.
Ground lost in the UK newspaper tabloid price wars continued to be clawed
back by United Newspapers, which added a penny at 522p on the back of the
success of its recent rights issue.
The newspaper group, which publishes the Daily Express and Daily Star,
announced that its rights issue was 95.7 per cent taken up.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In an otherwise poor session, shares in defence and electronics group GEC
bucked the market trend after a large institution moved to buy the stock.
Fund management group Robert Fleming was believed to have issued a buy order
for GEC. The institution was reported to have placed its order with BZW,
which was known to have a large buying order early in the session.
The stock responded by rising 5 to 329p, in hefty volume of 7.5m shares.
Broker Williams de Broe yesterday reiterated its buy recommendation on the
stock, suggesting it should be on a premium rating given its exposure to the
cyclical cycle.

FT  22 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: Food retailers hard hit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOOD retailers again suffered the fallout from widespread profits downgrades
and shares fell back across the sector. Argyll Group bore the brunt of
analysts' cutbacks as sector specialists reacted negatively to the agm held
on the previous day, and to the cautious note struck by Sir Alistair Grant,
its chairman.
Argyll was hit by downgrades from Hoare Govett, NatWest Securities and Smith
New Court, among others, with profits forecasts receding by around 5 per
cent to a range of Pounds 445m to Pounds 465m. Tesco was another retailer to
suffer cuts to its forecasts, Hoare and Smith both downgrading the stock.
The latter broker also reduced figures for J. Sainsbury and Asda.
Underlining its continued negative stance on the sector, one broker said
yesterday that it expected both Argyll and Tesco shares to underperform the
market by around 30 per cent over the next 12 months, and by some 16 per
cent against the sector.
Low growth in food prices is partly blamed by both brokers and company
executives for the faltering outlook. Sir Alistair said on Tuesday that food
price inflation was running below 1.5 per cent, significantly beneath
expectations in the stock market. Worries over the impact of discounting,
lower margins and market saturation have also underpinned the raft of
downgrades that have dogged the sector for the past five months.
Yesterday, as shares retreated, an afternoon rally suggested that a
short-term floor may have been found, although retailing analysts expect
that to be breached in time. Asda slipped a penny to 61 3/4 p, Argyll 7 to
295p in turnover of 7.2m shares, Kwik Save 12 to 658p and Tesco 2 to 202p.
Sainsbury recovered to close unchanged at 450p.

FT  22 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: Economic data little help for shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GOOD NEWS on the domestic economy was barely enough to sustain the London
stock market yesterday in the face of disturbing money supply figures from
Germany. UK stocks gave ground again ahead of today's important Maastricht
debate in the British parliament, and next week's important by-election test
for Mr Major's government.
However, the market bounced successfully from the Footsie 2,800 area.
Equities closed well above the worst of the day as investors took an
increasingly favourable view of the strong rise in domestic retail sales in
June and a significant improvement in the non-EC trade deficit.
The fresh round of good news on the UK economy, taken in tandem with a sharp
rise in annualised M3 money supply in Germany, had, once again, the perverse
effect of damping down hopes for an early cut in UK base rates. This
counter-balanced yesterday's firmness in sterling which was unhelpful for
British exporting firms.
After opening a shade firmer, equities drifted easier, brushing off the news
of a cut in repurchase rates in Germany, a prospect identified a week ago.
London stocks gave ground as sterling rose sharply after the disclosure that
UK retail sales had risen by 1.3 per cent in June, much stronger than
expected, and without restraining an excellent non-EC exports performance.
The day's low point saw the FT-SE 100 Index down by 22.1 at 2,801.8, but the
threat to the Footsie 2,800 mark brought buyers in. By the close the market
had rallied to a final reading on the FT-SE 100 of 2,814.1, leaving a loss
on the day of 9.8 points and a total fall of nearly 29 points over the past
two sessions.
Although market turnover remained relatively high, with Seaq volume of 554m
shares comparing with 604.9m on Tuesday, strategists doubted whether the
institutions had participated in the late rally. This week has, according to
analysts at several major firms, brought signs of increased selling by the
investment funds.
In the previous session, retail business was worth Pounds 1.46bn, a further
advance on last week when daily customer business jumped to Pounds 1.33bn
from Pounds 1.1bn a week earlier, according to statistics from NatWest
Securities.
This rise in investment activity in equities by genuine investment sources
at a time when shares have been falling has raised fresh concern over the
near-term outlook in a UK equity market which now appears to have reacted
too quickly earlier this year to expectations of economic recovery.
Yesterday's economic data indicated very favourable news on the domestic
economy, commented Mr Ian Harnett at Strauss Turnbull. However, he added
that in the continued uncertainty over the recovery in corporate profits,
sector analysts are likely to hold enthusiasm in check.
Thus, although store and retail issues were firm yesterday, queries were
raised in the stock market over the possible trend of retail profit margins
in this highly competitive sector.
The stock market was also held back by continued pressure on the
pharmaceutical issues from across the Atlantic and by weakness in the banks,
where fears that the sector is overvalued prompted a wave of profit-taking.

FT  22 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CAUTION again ruled the day in stock index futures as dealers refused to be
moved by good retail sales figures, Christine Buckley writes.
Institutional players were notable by their absence and there were few
buyers of the September FT-SE 100 contract, although sellers pushed up the
day's volume to quite a strong showing at 11,526 contracts.
The September contract started trading at 2,832, some 8 points up from its
previous finish, and its high of the session - only one point ahead at 2,833
 -was quickly reached. Thereafter it was downhill all the way.
The retail sales figures failed to pep up sentiment as bearish market
stories on the retail sector and fears over brand names took their toll.
Weak performances on the French and German markets added to the gloom, as
did fading hopes of German interest rate cuts.
As the opening of Wall Street approached, the contract sunk to the day's low
of 2,802. An afternoon rally pushed it up to a close of 2,818, about a point
ahead of its fair value premium to cash.
A low profile was similarly the order of the day in traded options, which
mustered a volume of 24,010 contracts.
The highest of the stock options was Lasmo, which traded 2,245 lots,
although 2,000 of these were down to one broker buying 1,000 of the August
puts and selling 1,000 November puts.

FT  22 JUL 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow at record despite worries
over Fed policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
A LATE afternoon rally lifted the Dow Jones Industrial Average to a record
level yest-erday, but market sentiment remained negative as uneasiness about
the Federal Reserve's monetary policy pushed market interest rates higher,
writes Karen Zagor in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended 10.62 higher at 3,555.40 after
showing a loss for most of the day. However, declines on the big board still
led rises by 1,051 to 901, underscoring the market's bearish tendencies, and
the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was off 0.13 at 447.18. The Nasdaq composite
slipped 1.82 to 700.08. NYSE volume was 278.6m shares.
Losses were more severe in the bond market, where the benchmark 30-year bond
fell  7/8 to 106 15/16 , yielding 6.621 per cent. Bonds have fallen steadily
since Tuesday, when Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, told
congress that US inflation was disappointing. His remarks sparked fears that
the Fed might tighten monetary policy.
Compaq Computer climbed Dollars 3 1/2 to Dollars 49 in very heavy trading
following the release of second-quarter earnings which met analysts'
forecasts. Compaq's ability to meet investor expectations was in contrast to
the performance of many other computer companies this quarter, most notably
Apple Computer, which disappointed investors last week with weak
third-quarter earnings.
In Nasdaq trading Apple's share price continued to erode after a one-day
hiatus on Tuesday. The stock was quoted Dollars  5/8 lower at Dollars 26 1/4
. Also in the technology sector, Intel shed Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 51 1/8
after a court ruled against the company in copyright litigation with
Advanced Micro Devices, Dollars  1/8 up at Dollars 24 3/4 .
UAL, parent of United Airlines, rose Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 138 3/8 after
the carrier's three biggest unions announced terms of their offer to
management. The unions, which last week said they would offer significant
cost reductions in exchange for a large stake in the airline, said they
would grant Dollars 3.6bn in labour concessions in return for a 60 per cent
stake.
Second-quarter results contributed to share price gains elsewhere in the
sector. USAir firmed Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 16 1/8 , although the company
said its results for the quarter trailed earlier expectations, reflecting
sluggish economic conditions. USAir posted operating income of Dollars
66.2m, against the previous operating loss of Dollars 67.9m.
The escalation of the tobacco industry price war hit the sector. RJ Reynolds
regained its morning loss to close unchanged after saying it would
consolidate three price levels into two in response to competitor Philip
Morris's permanent price cuts. The latter retreated Dollars 7/8 to Dollars
47 5/8.
Canada
TORONTO resumed its decline in fairly heavy trading, with gold issues
leading the way.
The TSE 300 index shed 8.8 to 3,867.4 and falls outpaced advances by 402 to
285. Volume came to 51.3m shares valued at CDollars 602.1m. The golds group
lost 1.3 per cent as the bullion price in New York fell USDollars 3.30 to
USDollars 388.65 an ounce.
Yesterday's drop marked the fifth fall in the past six sessions. After
closing just below the 4,000 mark on July 2, the 300-share index has tumbled
about 130 points.

FT  22 JUL 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei edges ahead as
Australia hits five-year high

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
UNCERTAINTY over political events and a gloomy outlook for the economy
discouraged investors, and business was slow as the Nikkei average gained
marginal ground, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei finished 42.91 higher at 20,080.91 after a day's low of 19,972.60
and high of 20,117.71. After institutional investors and foreigners
rearranged their portfolios during the first 30 minutes of trading, the
index remained around the 20,000 level, in line with index-linked activity.
Volume totalled 250m shares, against 236m. Traders noted the absence of
public pension and insurance funds. Declines led rises by 523 to 420, with
220 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks edged up
1.69 to 1,636.32 and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index firmed 0.44 to
1,244.39.
Weak economic figures suggested that while the economy has hit a bottom, the
wait for a rebound would be prolonged. A fund manager said that with the
economy moving in an 'L shape' it is unlikely that aggressive buying would
emerge in the short term.
Weak household spending figures indicated sluggish consumer confidence,
while the government's leading indicator fell below 50 per cent, the
boom-bust line, for the first time in four months.
Investors were also discouraged by reports that leading manufacturers,
including Toyota and electronics manufacturers, will lengthen their summer
holidays to curb output.
Stocks linked to East Japan Railway, which will have its shares listed on
the Tokyo Stock Exchange on October 26, were actively traded.
Advertising for the stock sale, by JR East and brokers, started yesterday.
Nippon Express, the parcel delivery company, rose Y10 to Y1,050 and Keisei
Electric Railway gained Y10 at Y1,260.
The lack of fresh news prompted speculative trading. Nikkatsu, the most
active issue of the day, firmed Y1 to Y20 and Nagase, a chemical maker, put
on Y20 at Y1,190 on rumours that a subsidiary was seeking to be listed.
Hazama, the construction group involved in several bribery scandals, lost
further ground, closing Y13 down at Y444.
Profit-taking depressed issues which had risen earlier on reports that DDI,
a telecommunications company, would apply for listing. Kyocera fell Y70 to
Y6,230 and Ushio retreated Y13 to Y950.
In Osaka, the OSE average rose 50.97 to 22,175.59 in volume of 20.8m shares.
Roundup
PACIFIC Rim markets found their own reasons for a series of mostly strong
performances.
AUSTRALIAN shares finished at their highest level since October 1987, with
local demand spurred by hopes of a cut in interest rates, perhaps after the
release of inflation and trade figures next week.
The market was also supported by strong European and Asian demand for blue
chip issues, and the All Ordinaries index ended 12.4 higher at 1,818.5 in
turnover of ADollars 436.9m.
NEW ZEALAND advanced to a three-year high, with encouragement for equities
coming from the bond market and an opinion poll giving the ruling
conservative National party a seven-point lead over the opposition Labour
party, ahead of the election later this year. The NZSE-40 index closed
15.59, or 0.9 per cent, ahead at 1,729.50.
KUALA LUMPUR climbed 2.1 per cent to an all-time peak amid strong
institutional buying of blue chip stocks after the market's recent
correction. The composite index was finally 15.70 up at 761.60 following
late profit-taking that had limited gains after index-linked stocks had led
the surge.
MANILA posted a record close, with local dealing fuelled by gains made on
Wall Street by Philippine Long Distance Telephone.
The composite index surged 31.09 to 1,681.86 as PLDT added 35 pesos at 1,050
pesos.
SINGAPORE rebounded on renewed institutional buying of blue chips after news
that Singapore Telecom's flotation would be carried out in stages, freeing
up the market's near to medium-term liquidity.
The Straits Times Industrial index finished 31.33, or 1.7 per cent, stronger
at 1,805.67.
KARACHI was again higher after further comments by Mr Moeen Qureshi, the
caretaker prime minister, reiterating a continuation of liberal economic
policies. The KSE index advanced 13.42 to 1,320.33.
BOMBAY edged forward on renewed buying by speculators from other centres
such as Calcutta and Ahmedabad. The BSE index closed 20.66 up at 2,126.15.
HONG KONG saw an early rally run out of steam, leaving the Hang Seng index a
net 6.83 off at 6,839.98 in turnover that shrank to HKDollars 2.35bn.
Stock prices opened higher and the index climbed more than 40 points at one
stage in the morning as optimism about the Sino-British talks sparked
buying.
But the mood changed in the afternoon, following news that the US could take
action against China if it continued to sell missiles to Pakistan.

FT  22 JUL 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): German M3 data counterbalance
repo rate cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE rise in German M3, coupled with a growing, but not universal, belief
that the Bundesbank is now unlikely to cut interest rates again before its
summer recess, left many markets weaker yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT liked a repo rate cut of 13 basis points to 7.15 per cent, but the
DAX index still incorporated Tuesday's post-bourse declines to close 15.18
lower at 1,823.81. In the afternoon, prices wavered in response to a rise in
Germany's M3 money supply growth indicator to 7.1 per cent, against the 6.6
per cent expected by most analysts.
Turnover fell from DM9.2bn to DM8.2bn. Mr Nigel Longley of Commerzbank said
that the bank was still a bull of the market, on indications that M3 will
get into its target 4.5 to 6.5 per cent growth 'corridor' in the second half
of this year, and in the expectation of a key interest rate cut next week.
Profit-taking hit both cyclicals, strong in the June quarter, and more
defensive stocks like utilities which have picked up in the past few days.
Daimler dropped DM9.50 to DM6.80 in carmakers, Thyssen shed DM7.50 to DM206
in steels and Viag, the ultility-based conglomerate, lost some of its recent
excitement with a fall of DM4.90 to DM393.30. However Mr Longley, like other
dealers, thought yesterday's fall a healthy reaction after a 140-point DAX
gain in just over a fortnight.
PARIS anticipated weakness in the bond market and fell sharply before
picking up some strength just before the close. The CAC-40 index ended off
20.91 or 1 per cent at 1,947.53, after a day's low of 1,939.
Turnover was estimated at FFr2.3bn.
In the automotive sector Peugeot closed FFr10 lower at FFr608 while Valeo
went against the trend with a rise of FFr8 to FFr897.
Flemings, in a recent research document on the European automotive industry,
gives a fairly positive long-term outlook for Peugeot, in spite of a gloomy
earnings outlook for 1993 and 1994. However, the brokers remark that efforts
by the group to improve productivity and keep manufacturing costs in check
should help it raise earnings potential from 1995 compared with other
European car manufacturers.
In contrast, James Capel yesterday issued a sell note on Valeo, which has
risen 22 per cent since its year's low in May, arguing that there is
considerable downside risk if the 'vague expectations of some form of a
corporate deal involving Cerus' (which has a 35 per cent stake in the group)
do not develop.
BSN was the day's most active issue, as the shares declined another FFr9 to
FFr833, with selling seen from the UK.
Unconfirmed reports of a possible agreement in the dispute between
Eurotunnel and TML contributed to the shares gaining 90 centimes or 2.5 per
cent to FFr36.30.
Alcatel slipped FFr4 to FFr641 after it said that it was buying a unit of
Northern Telecom of Canada, thereby creating the world's biggest undersea
cables group.
ZURICH regained a measure of composure after some heavy early selling had
continued Tuesday's market correction. The SMI index finished 9.0 lower at
2,315.1, after a day's low of 2,281.6.
UBS bearers again led the market lower, losing SFr6 to SFr1,119, while
Nestle, actively sold by foreign investors, dipped SFr16 to SFr1,032.
Insurers picked up after Tuesday's falls as it became clear that much of the
US flood damage was not insured. Zurich Insurance bearers and registered
shares added SFr38 and SFr40 respectively, both to SFr1,190.
Brown Boveri continued against the trend, adding SFr18 to SFr875.
MILAN made a firm start, before worries about the weakness of the lira
against the dollar and the D-Mark prompted a round of profit-taking which
left the Comit index 3.37 lower at 558.37.
A rise to 9.66 per cent in the average rate at the Bank of Italy's
repurchase tender, compared with the previous 9.34 per cent, was also higher
than the market had been expecting.
Olivetti's strong run came to an abrupt halt with a fall of L88 or 4.8 per
cent to L1,818, although it remains supported by expectations that it will
win the franchise for Italy's second mobile telephone operator.
Ferruzzi picked up another L25 or 6.5 per cent to L409.5 and Montedison was
L29.5 or 4.5 per cent higher at L680 on rising hopes for the rescue plan
being arranged by creditor banks.
AMSTERDAM's weakness continued with a fall in the CBS Tendency index of 1.0
to 116.2.
Nedlloyd rose on early reports that it might be seeking joint ventures or
mergers for its container shipping division, before falling back on a denial
by the group, to close off 10 cents at Fl 39.00.
Unilever pulled back from a year's low, ending off 60 cents at Fl 187.10
while DSM fell Fl 1.10 to Fl 96.90 ahead of second quarter results next week
which are expected to be disappointing.
STOCKHOLM ended its recent rally as domestic interest rates were increased
and profit-taking set in. The Affarsvarlden general index lost 13.30 to
1,142.40 as turnover slipped to SKr914m from SKr963m.

FT  22 JUL 93 / World Stock Markets: Brazil slips 4% after defeat of wages
bill
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN PITT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Many of the world's emerging markets suffered modest downward corrections
last week, with Brazil slipping some 4 per cent in dollar terms.
Brazil's fall, as measured by data provided by the IFC, a member of the
World Bank, followed the government's defeat on a wages bill which had aimed
to limit monthly wage increases. Subsequently, President Itamar Franco
vetoed the bill, and this week the market has again rallied.
Mexico, one of the world's laggards in performance terms so far this year,
has attracted the attention of First Boston's equity strategists. They have
recently recommended an overweight position in Mexico over the next quarter,
based on factors which include 'positive economic news, attractive
valuations and the imminent signing of the Nafta side agreements'.
The Indonesian market has shown a strong performance in dollar terms since
January. While it is one of the world's more illiquid markets, a point noted
by Baring Securities in a recent country review, the market has rallied by
30 per cent in the first half of 1993.
Baring comments that the rally has been led by forecasts of a projected
earnings recovery in 1994 and a reduction in interest rates. Daily turnover
has also recovered substantially, the broker comments, from Dollars 13m in
April to above Dollars 31m at the start of June.
A consolidation is forecast in the third quarter, with activity picking up
by the year-end on expectations of improved 1994 earnings, Baring concludes.

FT  22 JUL 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Sterling roller-coaster gains
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE POUND yesterday made erratic progress on the foreign exchanges, showing
early strength against both the dollar and the D-Mark which later proved
difficult to sustain.
During the morning, European currency traders seemed to shrug off worries
about today's Maastricht vote in the House of Commons, as sterling gained a
pfennig against the D-Mark, and more than a cent against the dollar. By the
end of trading, however, the UK currency had only built on these gains in
the case of the dollar, finishing 1.3 cents higher at Dollars 1.5145. Its
rise against the D-Mark had been trimmed to  3/4 pfennig at DM2.5725 by the
close.
Sterling's haphazard movement came as markets tried to weigh a new batch of
healthy domestic figures against the political trials facing the government
and the retreating prospect of German interest rate cuts. Retail sales rose
by 1.3 per cent in June compared with the previous month, while exports last
month climbed to their highest ever level. In the end, political instability
appeared to have been the least important factor.
The better than expected UK figures were decisive against the dollar, said
analysts, because the markets seem to be expecting quite poor economic
figures to come out of the US in the months ahead.
This would explain the dollar's fall the previous day, in spite of the
upbeat comments by the chairman of the Federal Reserve in his testimony
before congress on Tuesday. This would usually have boosted the US currency
but traders believe the desire to sell the dollar will continue.
Sterling's gains against the D-Mark were restrained by the fact that many
traders now think that unacceptable domestic monetary growth is going to
keep German interest rates high for a while longer.
Meanwhile, the currency markets did not appear to be too concerned about the
political uncertainties overshadowing British events.
'Foreign investors are tending to view the Maastricht vote the same way as a
number of MPs,' said Mr Julian Callow, international economist at Midland
Global Markets in London. 'They do not really understand the issue and are
just hoping it will all blow over. At the end of the day, most in the market
probably think Mr Major will win, but at the moment the pound is really only
reacting to economic news.'
The dollar also lost ground against the D-Mark, ending at DM1.6985, more
than a pfennig down on the day. The US currency finished New York trading at
DM1.6975.
The Bank of France announced that it had bought French francs, as traders
focused again on whether the French government can withstand an absence of
German interest rate cuts at next week's Bundesbank council meeting. The
French currency finished at FFr3.415 per D-Mark, a little above the previous
day's FFr3.417 close.

FT  22 JUL 93 / Money Markets: German M3 worries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHANIE FLANDERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ODDS lengthened yesterday for a cut in German official interest rates
before the Bundesbank's summer recess with the news that German monetary
growth had risen to an annualised 7.1 per cent, writes Stephanie Flanders.
Forecasters had predicted that the growth in German M3 would be around 6.6
per cent. This would have skirted the edges of the German central bank's
target range, giving it some leeway to reduce official rates at next week's
council meeting. But the revelation that money growth had accelerated in
June compared to the previous month's figures left many seeing little chance
of a pre-recess rate reduction.
Rumours that the figures would disappoint had spread through European
markets on Tuesday. But the Bundes-bank's decision yesterday to allow a
lower repo rate of 7.15 per cent, compared with 7.28 per cent last week,
left many analysts not knowing what to expect.
'The balance of market opinion now considers a discount rate cut unlikely,'
said one London-based economist. 'Particularly when we could see German
inflation figures of around 4.4 to 4.5 per cent sometime over the next few
days.'
The new pessimism remains tempered, however, by the fact that the new pact
left the repo rate only 45 basis points above the current German discount
rate of 6.75 per cent. There are those who think that the Bundesbank will
feel uneasy entering the thin markets of the summer recess with only this
limited scope to react to renewed ERM tension.
Amid such imponderables, European money market rates were a little subdued
in yesterday's trading. But both D-Mark and French franc future contracts
fell in response to the German money supply data. The D-Mark September
contract closed at 93.16, down 11 basis points from the previous day.
September Pibor futures were similarly affected, dropping 13 points to
finish at 92.69.
In London money markets, conditions tightened through the day due to a
lingering shortage, initially forecast at Pounds 1.3bn but later revised
upwards to Pounds 1.45bn. Overnight rates started the day at around 6 3/4
per cent, but rose consist-ently to reach 8 per cent towards the close.
Trading in sterling futures was also affected by the German data, with
September sterling ending 8 points lower at 94.04.

FT  22 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Support package agreed for
Russian energy sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RUSSIA'S HARD-pressed energy enterprises appear to have won massive
government credit to assist them in meeting the demands of the coming
winter. At a meeting with energy industry ministers on Tuesday evening they
also seem effectively to have secured the halting of the privatisation
programme in the oil, gas and coal sectors and further curbs on foreign
investment in their industries.
Mr Alvin Yeriomin, chairman of the parliamentary committee on industry who
attended the meeting, said yesterday that the participants agreed an
expensive package of support for energy - following weeks during which heads
of the enterprises had all complained loudly of being starved of credits and
investment, and warned of collapse by the end of the year. The meeting was
attended by Mr Oleg Soskovets, first deputy prime minister for industry and
energy and Mr Yuri Shafrannik, the energy minister.
Among the issues agreed, according to Mr Yeriomin, were:
The government would settle outstanding debts between the enterprises,
estimated at about six trillion (million, million) roubles (Pounds 3.8bn);
Special government subsidies would be provided for coal and geological
research within the existing budget, amounting to Rbs2 trillion;
Prices would be kept down by agreement between supplier and producer or,
failing this, by 'administrative means' - ie, by government decree;
Low interest credits amounting to Rbs1.8 trillion should be available to the
energy sector by September;
The privatisation of the oil companies should be 'stabilised' - by calling a
halt to the break up of corporations and retaining a controlling parcel of
shares in the hands of the government;
The law on foreign investment should be amended, taking into account the
'specific features' of the fuel and energy complex - with possible
additional conditions attached to future concessions to foreign companies -
probably requiring use of Russian equipment.
The meeting, which took place under the aegis of the Russian parliament and
with the attendance of Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, the parliament's speaker, did
not include a representative of the finance or privatisation ministries -
and thus may still be controversial within the ranks of the government.
However, if approved, it shows the continuing and growing power of the oil
'barons' in dictating terms for an industry that provides some 70 per cent
of hard currency earnings as well as the country's fuel needs.
An attempt by Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian President, to liberalise the
price of coal by a decree last month has effectively been neutralised by an
agreement to raise the coal price only by the level of inflation for the
immediate future. An attempt by the government to establish a special fund
to support mining communities thrown out of work because of pit closures by
increasing value added tax by 3 per cent was rejected by parliament earlier
this week.
Mr Soskovets said last week that the 'price for coal should be set at a
level which avoids a loss of competitiveness in the adjacent branches of
industry' - especially the steel and aluminium industries, now earning
precious hard currency by selling abroad at low prices.

AMBASSADORS FROM 13 tobacco-exporting countries are fighting a provision
slipped into the US Budget Bill that would require US cigarette
manufacturers to use a minimum of 75 per cent of domestically-grown tobacco
in their products.
Under the provision, inserted by Senator Wendell Ford, a Kentucky Democrat,
cigarette producers would face substantial penalties for using more than 25
per cent imported tobacco.
'For years, US representatives in the Gatt Uruguay Round negotiations and
elsewhere have been consistently fighting against this kind of provision in
the name of free trade and for the benefit of both consumers and efficient
producers,' the ambassadors said in a letter to Representative Kika De La
Garza, who heads the house committee on agriculture.
Signatories to the letter were the ambassadors from Brazil, Argentina, Costa
Rica, Chile, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras,
Panama, Colombia, Malawi, Zimbabwe and India.
An aide to Senator Ford said the measure was necessary to protect domestic
tobacco growers from the 'growing influx of tobacco coming into the
country'.

FT  22 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Opec faces worst crisis since
1986 says Iran
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries is facing its worst crisis
since 1986, when oil prices collapsed almost overnight, Mr Gholamreza
Aqazadeh, the Iranian oil minister, said in Tehran.
Mr Aqazadeh was referring to the Dollars 3 a barrel fall in oil prices since
May because of over-production by member countries and the threat of an
Iraqi return to the oil market.
In 1986 prices fell from Dollars 30 a barrel to about Dollars 15 within a
few days because of over-production.
Opec has called an emergency meeting for next Wednesday to try to calm the
market.
Baghdad has been discussing with the United Nations a possible one-off oil
sale worth Dollars 1.6bn (Pounds 1.1bn).
But traders think progress with Iraq on weapons monitoring issues could see
a wider lifting of sanctions and a partial return to the export market.
Mr Aqazadeh, speaking on Tehran radio, said Opec must accommodate Iraq
within the existing production ceiling and that Kuwait should be persuaded
to sign the conference resolution.
Opec's last meeting broke up when Kuwait refused to sign the producers' club
accord to restrain output and said it would prime its own taps to produce as
much oil as it could.
Mr Jean Ping, Gabon's oil minister and current Opec president, held talks in
London yesterday with his Kuwaiti counterpart, Mr Ali Ahmed al-Baghli, in an
effort to persuade him to delay the emirate's production increase.
Oil prices edged up by 25 cents to close at Dollars 16.85 a barrel in London
trading in response to Kuwait's apparent willingness to re-enter Opec's
fold.
Mr al-Baghli said he might put off his demand for a quota increase to 2.16m
barrels a day (b/d) until October if other members curbed their own
production.
Kuwait is currently producing about 1.7m to 1.8m b/d and had been planning
to boost output by about 100,000 b/d up to the end of September.
Other members are also ignoring their quotas and the organisation as a whole
is producing between 24.3m and 24.5m b/d compared with a ceiling of 23.6m
b/d set at the last meeting.
Mr Ping must try to reinforce production discipline or at least to build a
consensus for action to be taken at the next meeting.
Mr Ping's next stop on his present tour of the Middle East is Saudi Arabia
where he will hold talks with Mr Hisham Nazer, oil minster of Opec's largest
producer, whose support will be vital to any deal.
In the meantime, the oil market remains nervous but fairly quiet while
traders consider Opec's possible next move.
Prices are likely to be volatile in response to any headline news that
emerges from the organisation.

FT  22 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Coffee growers' retention
scheme gaining in credibility
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LATIN American coffee retention scheme looks increasingly likely to
start as planned at the beginning of October, according to London analysts.
'We have got to give a lot of credibility to the retention scheme,' said Mr
Lawrence Eagles, analyst with GNI, the London futures brokers, yesterday.
'The retention scheme is gaining in credibility,' agreed Mr Peter Kettle, of
ED &amp; F. Man, the London trade house.
The scheme aims to take 20 per cent of participating countries' production
off the world market. Producers want to force prices well above the
historically low levels that they have suffered since the collapse of the
International Coffee Organisation's export quota system in 1989.
Producing countries believe that a cumulative Dollars 10bn has been wiped
off the value of the coffee they have sold over the past four years. Last
March saw the collapse in disarray of the last of a series of meetings at
the International Coffee Organisation aimed at reviving the international
agreement.
Colombia and the Central American producers of top quality arabica coffees
immediately started to explore ways of forcing the market up. The
breakthrough came at the beginning of this month at a meeting in San
Salvador when Brazil, the biggest producer, proposed the retention of 20 per
cent of exports.
When the New York arabica futures traders returned from their Independence
Day holiday, prices rose by more than 5 cents a lb. London's second position
robusta contract touched Dollars 1,000 a tonne.
However, widespread scepticism soon emerged about the ability of the
producers to create viable rules for their retention scheme. That scepticism
appears to be evaporating.
On Tuesday Colombia and Central American producers said after a meeting in
Guatemala City that they had sufficient controls to implement a retention
scheme in October. 'Colombia and Central American countries are ready to put
retention into practice. Each one of the countries has rules to retain
coffee and to control retention efficiently,' they told the Reuter news
agency.
Eight African countries, including the Ivory Coast, Uganda and Kenya, are
thought to be ready to join the scheme, according to a report from
Knight-Ridder. African producers are due to meet on August 16 and 17 in
Kampala.
If those eight countries back the Latin Americans, the proportion of world
coffee production represented by the scheme will rise from just over 50 per
cent to more than 64 per cent.
The Latin American countries meet in Rio de Janeiro on July 29 and 30 to
thrash out the workings of the scheme and officially to inaugurate a new
Association of Coffee Producing Countries.
Last week coffee prices were once again on the upward path over fears of
frost in Brazil. The fears have disappeared, but prices have not retreated
far. Last night the London September price closed at Dollars 997 a tonne -
compared with Dollars 926 just before the San Salvador meeting and Dollars
862 a tonne as the ICO talks collapsed at the end of March. New York's
nearby arabica contract was 72.20 cents a lb in late trading last night,
compared with a low this year of 51.70.
Mr Eagles believes the producers had no option but to try to transfer the
balance of power from consumers to producers once the ICO talks had failed.
'It will be difficult for them to stick together,' he said, but the economic
pain they had suffered might be sufficient if they were not too ambitious.'
Mr Kettle pointed out that after the interminable ICO negotiations, the
markets were now seeing some real action. 'There has been a remarkable
degree of agreement about everything so far,' he added.

CLEANING UP more than 550,000 abandoned hardrock mines in 32 US states could
cost between Dollars 32bn and Dollars 71.5bn, according to a report by the
Mineral Policy Centre, a Washington-based mining reform lobby group, reports
Reuter from Washington.
Hardrock mining is the extraction of metals such as gold, silver, copper,
iron, uranium, zinc and nonfuel minerals such asbestos, gypsum, phosphate
rock, sulphur by surface or underground mining methods. Abandoned hardrock
mine sites include underground mine openings, open pits and waste rock
piles.
The report, Burden of Gilt, calls for an establishment of a national
hardrock abandoned mines reclamation programme that would include a
nationwide inventory of sites on public and private lands.
It also urges a minimum of Dollars 400m a year to fund the programme from
fees and royalties on the mining industry.
The report was immediately attacked by the Mineral Resources Alliance, the
trade association for the mining industry, and Senator Larry Craig,
Republican, Idaho.
'They admit they don't know how many sites, therefore they don't know the
cost of clean-up,' said Senator Craig, author of the Mining Reform Act,
which has already passed in the Senate. He suggested the cost would be much
lower.

FT  22 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Output goals leave China with
feed gap - Changes in eating habits are posing problems for the future
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LYNNE O'DONNELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GROWING affluence of the urban Chinese is leading to changes in eating
habits that could make the country one of the biggest markets for feed grain
and a net importer by the end of the century.
Despite China's almost desperate desire to be self-sufficient, consumption
of animal and dairy products is growing each year by up to 6 per cent while
the value of crop output is rising each year by barely 1 per cent.
'It's not a long way off that China will be a net feed importer,' says Mr
Jeff Brown, representative in Beijing of the US Feed Grains Council. 'We are
looking at a nationwide steady 5 to 6 per cent increase in the consumption
of meat, milk and eggs, per capita per annum.'
Last year, according to official figures, China produced 34.5m tonnes of
ready-to-use feed, known as compound feed, for livestock and poultry, an
increase of 7.5 per cent on the year before. China is the world's biggest
producer of meat and eggs but industry officials in Beijing say less than
one third of all poultry and livestock receive compound feed.
The officials estimate that, with private production factored in, China's
actual compound feed production was probably closer to 50m tonnes, but the
figure remains a fraction of the 200m tonnes produced each year by the US.
Analysts say China's production of feed grains - maize, sorghum and
soyabeans - can in no way keep pace with long term demand.
'Soyabeans are the way of the future,' says one Western feed grain industry
executive. 'Demand for (soyabean) feed has gone up by 50 per cent in four or
five years, from 4m to 6m tonnes.'
He puts annual soyabean demand at 12m tonnes. China grows an annual average
of some 10m tonnes, exporting about 3.5m tonnes either as beans or meal.
China's GDP grew by 12 per cent in 1992. Official figures show that crop
output value was up 1.2 per cent on 1991, and animal husbandry output was up
by 6.1 per cent. The total value of agricultural production was reported to
be USDollars 150m.
With those figures on the board and with seemingly fantastic agricultural
output goals to achieve by the end of the century, China's only option for
maintaining production at a level that can keep pace with demand would
appear to be the import of huge amounts of feed grains.
For instance, China wants to increase egg production by 10 per cent a year
by 2000 and double per capita consumption by then from the present 100 eggs
a year to 200. To achieve that, the chicken population would have to grow to
the same level as the human population and China is expected by the turn of
the century to be home to more than 1.3bn people.
'Can they hit that?' asks a Western industry observer of Beijing's egg
production target. 'No way. Because that alone would need an extra 10m
tonnes of soyabean meal a year and (China) cannot afford it.'
Pork and poultry production goals would add another 5m tonnes to soyabean
meal demand, boosting China's total annual need by the end of the millennium
to more than 20m tonnes.
'They are going to have to slow down,' says another expert. 'Prices are
going to have to limit demand and that's a trend we are already noticing.
Prices went up 80 per cent between February and August last year and though
they're back down, they're still 50 per cent higher than they were a year
ago.'
Shortages after this year's spring harvest were exacerbated by farmers who
held on to soyabeans for later planting in the hope of taking advantage of
higher prices. However, with little agricultural sophistication and almost
no forward planning, this could do little more than to follow up the
shortage with a glut.
The shortage also squeezed the availability of supplies to meet China's
export obligations. Inability to fulfil soyabean export contracts to Japan
and South-east Asia caused such friction for Beijing that it quietly began
looking around on the international market for up to 500,000 tonnes of
soyabean meal.
The US has also been working hard to convince China that corn gluten meal is
an economically-viable alternative to Peruvian fish meal as a livestock and
poultry feed source. According to the US Feed Grains Council, China is the
only Asian country not using imported corn gluten meal, which is Dollars 150
a tonne cheaper than Peruvian fish meal and was expected to be imported this
year in at least trial quantities.
Total US exports of corn gluten meal in 1990 were 535,000 tonnes. 'So even
if China imports 50,000 to 100,000 tonnes, it would be a significant market
to us,' says the council's Mr Brown.
A US agriculture official predicts that China's demand for maize must also
rise to meet growing feed needs.
'In the past few years, China has become self-sufficient in a lot of things
they weren't self-sufficient in before - vegetable oil, cotton, corn
(maize), and protein meals like cotton seed meal, rape seed meal, corn meal,
all of them feed products,' he says.
'But we think they'll be after more corn pretty soon because they can't keep
pace with demand. They don't even know what real demand is.'
Another western expert in Beijing observes: 'The Chinese don't like to hear
that they'll be importing because they're such sticklers for
self-sufficiency.
'But anyone who's honest, even at high levels, admits that the day will come
that they'll be importing feed for the livestock industries. They'd like
that to be 10 years off, we believe it's eight, and the more bullish
projections give it five years'.

TIN hit fresh 20-year lows on the LME as half-hearted support near Dollars
5,000 a tonne for three-month metal was decisively broken. Dealers said sell
stops were triggered below the previous low of Dollars 4,990. Talk that
fresh shipments of Far Eastern metal are heading for Europe underlined
negative fundamentals. ALUMINIUM'S advance was scuppered by selling and
resistance near Dollars 1,230 a tonne for three-month metal and the market
eased back to end at Dollars 1,221.50. Dealers said recent speculative
buying and good support below Dollars 1,200 suggested that the market might
have bottomed out. There is also likely to be caution over the possible
closure of Alcan's Kitimat smelter, as 275,000 tonnes of capacity is
threatened by possible strike action on Friday. Chicago WHEAT futures were
mostly firm on some concern about losses of US wheat yields and quality
because of the rain in the Central and Northern Plains, traders said. The
harvest has been stalled in some areas and slowed in others and the ripening
crop in the Northern Plains is receiving more rain than it needs. Warmer and
drier weather is needed to help ripen the crop and aid harvesting.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Australian Wool Realisation Commission has for two weeks reported
relatively heavy sales, reaching almost 25,000 bales. Buyers needed to cover
sales to China, transacted in Australia and in types and for delivery which
clearly meant using the stockpile as a source of supply. In the latest week
Russia was mentioned as a buyer, at normal premium prices and with payment
before release of the wool. Though the quantity was small at 3,500 bales
this is being taken as a hopeful market pointer for when auctions are
resumed.

<TEXT>
THE NEW York Mercantile Exchange and the Bolsa de Mercadorias &amp; Futuros in
Sao Paulo, Brazil, have agreed to sign a memorandum of understanding to
explore areas of potential co-operation, the exchanges said yesterday,
reports Reuter from New York.
The exchanges said they would discuss sharing information on technical,
market, regulatory and business issues, and explore the potential for joint
projects that would mutually benefit the exchanges and their memberships.
'It's very, very preliminary and we haven't even looked at the potential
areas yet,' a Nymex official said.
Mr Patrick Thompson, the exchange's president said: 'As two of the world's
leading commodity exchanges, sharing ideas and information will not only be
advantageous to our institutions and memberships, but also to the world
commodity industry'.
Nymex is the world's largest oil market, offering trading in crude, heating
oil, gasoline, natural gas and propane, as well as platinum futures and
options and palladium futures.
The statement said BM &amp; F, according to Futures Industry Association
figures, was the world's sixth largest commodity and futures exchange, with
daily volume of about Dollars 2bn.
It trades gold, interest rates, coffee, stock index futures, US dollars,
soyabeans, cotton and live cattle.
BM &amp; F said the memorandum would be an important step towards
'globalisation' of the two markets.

FT  22 JUL 93 / Government Bonds: German M3 data send European sector
tumbling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN and KAREN ZAGOR
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HIGHER-than-expected German money supply data sent European government bond
markets tumbling yesterday as hopes for general interest rate cuts took a
knock.
Speculation that Germany's M3 figure for June would come in above 7 per cent
filtered into the market on Tuesday, and half an hour before the data were
released there was a wave of sell orders throughout Europe.
The actual headline figure of 7.1 per cent was distorted by a surge in
repatriation of international assets, which often represents a correction
following earlier central bank intervention. Once that was removed, there
were few signs of inflationary pressure.
However, the details were preceded by comments from Mr Johann Wilhelm
Gaddum, the vice-president designate of the Bundesbank, who said that if M3
was outside the target range of between 4.5 and 6.5 per cent there was no
justification for a rate cut.
The chain of events dented confidence that the Bundesbank would cut official
rates next Thursday. Ms Alison Cottrell, international economist at Midland
Global Markets, said: 'Mr Gaddum's comments on the importance of the M3
target will not have been a coincidence. If the foreign exchange figure
(between France and Germany) is not too appalling this points to the council
sitting tight.'
One of the three senior economists at SG Warburg said: 'Beforehand, we were
two-to-one in favour of a cut. Now we are all in favour of not cutting.'
Earlier in the day, the German central bank carried out its weekly repo
operation at 7.15 per cent, allocating DM66.6bn against expiring funds of
DM75.6bn. Some economists took heart from the willingness to ease in the
face of the money supply figures, but others said the central bank had no
choice because the commercial banks were cash heavy following the recent
speculation against the French franc and had very little need of funds.
German bund futures for September traded on Liffe fell from 96.09 to 95.83.
THE Bundesbank's perceived unwillingness to ease further in the face of high
money supply added to the pressure on the French franc and spilled over to
the French debt market yesterday.
French government bond futures traded on the Matif broke through a key
support level and fell more than half a point to 119.74.
The argument was that if Germany does not cut, France might have to raise
rates to relieve speculative pressure on the currency. If rates go higher
for any length of time the bond market - which has remained attractive
because of low inflation - will begin to look expensive.
One dealer said yesterday: 'We have seen the seeds of a shift in the bullish
sentiment. The big question is whether the domestic investors will remain
faithful.'
UK government bonds largely survived the impact of supposedly booming high
street sales, but the added pressure of high German M3 data was too much and
gilts ended weaker along the yield curve.
The rise in retail sales hit short-dated maturities which anticipate base
rate forecasts, but the impact was muted as economists said the boost merely
reflected price cutting and not a rise in consumer spending.
LONGER-dated US Treasuries fell steeply as the market continued to register
fears that the Federal Reserve may tighten monetary policy. The prospect of
greater supply of Treasuries and corporate paper also depressed prices.
The benchmark 30-year government bond lost  3/4 of a point during the day,
and was trading late in the afternoon at 106 19/32 , yielding 6.612 per
cent. The short end of the market held up better, with the two-year note
down  3/16 , to yield 4.107 per cent.
Sentiment was bearish in the wake of Mr Alan Greenspan's testimony before
Congress on Tuesday. The chairman of the Federal Reserve had predicted that
the economy would continue to firm through the rest of this year and into
1994. He also forecast GDP growth of more than 3 per cent for the second
half of this year.
Mr Greenspan's remarks about 'disappointing' inflation prompted speculation
that the Federal Reserve might tighten monetary policy to check inflation.
The prospect of new calls on investors' cash also depressed the market.
During the afternoon the Treasury said it would auction Dollars 16bn of
two-year notes and Dollars 11bn of five-year notes next week. New corporate
bond issues and the prospect of an estimated Dollars 4bn of bonds from
municipal borrowers added to the fears that heavy supply would push yields
higher.

ITOCHU Corp, the Japanese trading house, is to set up a Dollars 2.5bn
medium-term note programme in the first move by a Japanese company following
the Ministry of Finance's latest deregulation, Reuter reports from Tokyo.
The ministry last week allowed Japanese corporations to issue foreign bonds
overseas under a programme through which issuers can launch bonds quickly up
to a certain ceiling. The system will help shorten the time taken to issue
foreign bonds to three days from two weeks, the ministry said.
The programme, to be listed on the London Stock Exchange, will be set up
later this month. It is likely to issue Euroyen bonds first under the
programme, where the firm can issue bonds in most major currencies with
maturities of more than four years.

FT  22 JUL 93 / International Capital Markets: Walt Disney doubles size of
100-year offer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WALT Disney, the US entertainment group, yesterday became the first borrower
in nearly 40 years to raise money through an issue of bonds in the US market
with a maturity of 100 years.
The size of the issue, redeemable July 15 2093, was doubled to Dollars 300m,
fuelled by a demand from US bond investors for higher returns in the face of
record-low Treasury bond yields.
The bonds were priced yesterday morning in New York to yield 95 basis points
over the benchmark 30 Treasury bond. They were estimated to offer investors
some 15-20 basis points above what they might have received had the company
issued 30-year bonds: a 40-year issue from McDonald's, the hamburger chain
(which like Disney is a weak double-A credit), was recently launched at a
yield spread of 75 basis points, and was yesterday trading at a spread of 80
basis points over the long Treasury bond.
The Treasury market rally has already brought a flurry of 50-year
transactions this year, from Texaco, Boeing and Ford among others. The last
100-year deal is thought to have been a 1954 issue by Chicago &amp; Eastern
Illinois, a railway company, with a coupon of 5 per cent.
The Disney deal, which was offered at par with a coupon of 7.55 per cent, is
callable after 30 years. It has an average duration of roughly 13 years,
making it only slightly longer than a comparable 30-year bond, said Mr Mark
Seigel, head of corporate bond underwriting at Morgan Stanley.
Demand had shown that the yield pick-up was seen by investors as an adequate
compensation for this increase in duration, he said.

FT  22 JUL 93 / International Bonds: Guilder interest prompts Fl 1bn issue
from Denmark
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOVEREIGN and corporate borrowers yesterday tapped the international bond
market in various sectors, with some keen to take advantage of demand for
the more stable European currencies in view of recent turbulence in the
exchange rate mechanism.
The Kingdom of Denmark launched a Fl 1bn, five-year deal which was priced to
yield 20 basis points over the new state loan - the 6 1/4 per cent bond due
1998.
ABN-Amro, the lead manager, said Denmark wanted to take advantage of strong
investor demand for guilders. The government recently raised Fl 9bn with its
new five-year state loan, and the lead manager felt there was still demand
for this maturity.
With both the French franc and Danish krone under attack, some investors are
keen to switch into the core currencies of the D-Mark and the guilder, and
the latter is seen as enjoying better economic fundamentals with a low
inflation background. The bonds held their yield spread at around 20 basis
points.
In the equity-linked sector, SG Warburg Group launched a 15-year convertible
bond which was increased to Pounds 91m from Pounds 80m to meet very strong
demand from continental and UK fund management groups.
Although the share price fell back, participating banks said there was very
little evidence of investors switching out of the equity to buy the
convertible bonds, adding that the issue attracted a 'different class of
investors' to the traditional equity investor. The steady pound and strong
UK bond background apparently attracted continental investors.
The convertible bond was issued at par and rose to trade at 102.5 on the bid
side, as demand far outstripped supply. SG Warburg pointed out that
restrictions on the total size of the deal meant that the issue could not be
raised further.
Against other recent Euro-sterling convertible bond issues, the Warburg deal
has a relatively low coupon of 6.5 per cent. The conversion price was set at
Pounds 8.54, giving a conversion premium of 18 per cent over where the stock
was trading at launch.
The Kingdom of Sweden launched a Pta20bn reverse floating rate note, the
first time such an instrument has been issued in this currency according the
BBV, lead manager. The deal was increased from Pta15bn with the coupon fixed
at 10.75 per cent for the first year and thereafter allowed to float at 18
per cent minus six-month Libor.

FT  22 JUL 93 / International Capital Markets: Setback for CBOT as deal
falls through
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A YEAR-LONG negotiation by the Chicago Board of Trade to acquire a New-York
based government securities dealing house has fallen through, halting the
exchange's plans to enter the cash government bond dealing business, writes
Laurie Morse.
Last July the CBOT agreed to acquire EJV Brokerage, an electronic broker
owned jointly by affiliates of six New York banks and brokerage houses. The
CBOT is the world's largest futures exchange, and trades futures and options
on US government bonds and notes.
The EJV acquisition has languished in Washington for over nine months under
Securities and Exchange Commission consideration. The CBOT said that rising
costs due to the delay in receiving regulatory approval forced EJV to
withdraw from the deal.

ISRAEL yesterday announced results for its state-owned sector and gave an
indication of the progress of the privatisation programme.
State companies lost Shk220.3m (Dollars 78.6m) last year following a
combined loss of Shk1bn by Israel Aircraft Industries and Israel Military
Industries. But companies in which the government has sold partial stakes -
such as Bezeq, the communications monopoly, and Israel Chemicals - increased
profits.
'The four utilities - electricity, water, transportation and
telecommunications - are in an expansion phase, while defence activity is
shrinking,' said Mr Yossi Nitzani, director of the Government Companies
Authority.
Excluding the defence industries, state-controlled companies showed a profit
of Shk801m, a 13 per cent increase over 1991. Bezeq announced profits of
Shk207.4m, up from Shk186.5m in 1991. Israel Electric overturned its 1991
loss of Shk79.4m to post profits of Shk184m, while Israel Chemicals improved
profits to Shk180.9m from Shk171.6m.
Mr Nitzani said that during the first five months of this year the
government sold Dollars 615.8m worth of companies, compared with total
divestment last year of Dollars 632.6m.

FT  22 JUL 93 / International Company News: G30 sets new benchmark for
derivatives industry - Tracy Corrigan assesses the latest report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
What sets yesterday's Group of 30 report on derivatives activity apart from
the clutch of reviews published in recent months is not the thrust of its
conclusions, but rather the detail and scope of its recommendations.
Unlike the reviews already published - most importantly by the Bank of
England and the Bank for International Settlements (the Promisel report) -
the G30 report was written by, and primarily for, market practitioners.
It has little to add to the regulatory debate on derivatives, and indeed
eschews some of the important issues that trouble regulators.
For example, Mr Paul Volcker, a former regulator and chairman of G30, notes
in his foreword to the report the 'virtual absence of comment about the
appropriate level of capital requirements . . . Plainly the authors believe
that the amount of capital needed to support derivatives exposure is a
matter of judgment for individual institutions.'
Indeed, the potential weak spot of the report, in spite of the status of the
G30, is that it is largely compiled and written by bankers, with a vested
interest in promoting a positive view of their market.
However, the recommendations, which provide the most detailed guidelines on
managing derivatives business to date, are expected to be studied closely by
market participants - although they may find some of the smaller ones,
particularly those involving information technology, expensive to implement.
The recommendations may be used by regulators as a benchmark for good
derivatives management.
According to Mr Paul Sproos, publisher of Swaps Monitor, a trade
publication, the recommendations 'set extraordinarily high standards. I do
not think that there is a single swaps dealer who meets all of them in
full.'
The report makes a total of 20 recommendations, backed by research into
practice among market practitioners and end-users conducted by Price
Waterhouse, accountants.
The Price Waterhouse survey, which is only sporadically quoted, has not been
published with the recommendations. The most important are:
Senior management should determine and control derivatives activity.
The Price Waterhouse report found that two-thirds of firms responding to the
survey involve senior management in authorising traders to commit the firm.
That means up to a third of senior managers may be broadly unaware of how
their derivatives business is run.
Dealers should mark their positions to market (adjust the valuation of their
positions in line with market movements). The survey found that more than
half the end-users do not follow this practice although most plan to do so.
The report gives detailed recommendations on market valuation methods, which
are subject to wide variation, according to the survey.
Dealers should run stress simulations to determine how their portfolios
would perform in worst-case scenarios. Stress testing is conducted mainly by
large dealers, according to the survey.
Credit risk should be reduced by broadening the use of netting provisions
(allowing banks to focus on net rather than gross exposure) and by ensuring
that contracts can be legally enforced across different jurisdictions.
There should be independent market and credit risk management, so that this
is separated from the dealing function.
The recommendations were welcomed as fair by the International Swaps and
Derivatives Association (ISDA), the industry's trade association. 'It's a
question of fine-tuning but they are likely to contain some things that are
not being done even in the largest firms,' said Mr Joe Bauman, chairman of
ISDA and head of derivatives business development at Citibank.
Meanwhile, a number of reports on the derivatives market are still in the
pipeline, including three studies in the US by the Securities and Exchange
Commission, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and, most important,
the General Accounting Office.
If the conciliatory tone of reports published so far persists, it may be
that the heat is off the derivatives industry, and regulators' concerns have
been largely addressed.

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LEADING creditors of Daiichi, the Japanese real estate company facing
financial difficulties, have agreed to forego interest on loans to aid the
restructuring of the group.
Mitsui Trust &amp; Banking, Yasuda Trust &amp; Banking, Nippon Credit Bank, and Chuo
Trust &amp; Banking will waive until March 1995 the 3 per cent interest on total
debts of Y300bn (Dollars 2.8bn).
The waiver is expected to ease Daiichi's debt burden by about Y9bn a year.
The move will hit the banks, which face mounting bad loans.
In March last year, the four banks lowered interest rates on loans to
Daiichi, which has some Y550bn in total debt. Daiichi plans to ask other
creditors to lower interest to 0.5 per cent.

price

<TEXT>
ANGLOVAAL, the South African gold mine group, increased taxed profits by 84
per cent to R71.2m (Dollars 21.4m) in the June quarter, against the
preceding three months.
Most of the turnround was attributable to Hartebeestfontein, the group's
flagship mine, which raised taxed profits to R56.1m from R36.4m.
The improved profits were mainly due to a 15 per cent increase in the
average gold price received for the mine's underground operations.
The turnround at Loraine, a marginal mine threatened with closure, was also
an important contributor. The mine made a R9.4m profit in the quarter after
a R2m loss for the previous quarter. The results show, for the first time,
the benefits of a seven-day working week - an exemption from the government
 -for a full quarter. This led to a 30 per cent increase in gold production.
Eastern Transvaal, the other large mine in the group, lifted taxed profits
to R5.4m from R4.2m.

FT  22 JUL 93 / International Company News: Gengold gains 31% to R100.3m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE 10 mines in the Gengold group posted a 31 per cent increase in net
profits to R100.3m (Dollars 30.3m) in the June quarter over the previous
quarter. The group was helped by cost controls and a firmer gold price.
The result was largely due to improved performances at Beatrix,
Buffelsfontein and Kinross. It was achieved on a fall in gold production to
16,742kg from 17,156kg - but an average price rise of 5.5 per cent to
R34,766 per kg.
Mr Gary Maude, managing director, said the better price required the group
to move from using hedging as a survival technique to using it as insurance
against a sudden fall in the price of gold.
He said the group had last sold gold forward in May and would be busy
winding up existing forward positions until May next year. At current gold
prices, Gengold's profits would be 25 per cent to 30 per cent higher were it
not for the group's hedging programme.
The group has used the better gold price to increase capital expenditure,
which at R39.7m was 105.3 per cent higher than in the previous quarter.
Mr Maude said large capital projects would probably be started if, in six
months, the strong gold price had been maintained.
However, he stressed the mines' priority was to secure dividends and that
capital expenditure would not come at their expense.
One disappointing feature of the results was the performance of Grootvlei.
Mr Maude said its future remained threatened, even at the higher gold price,
unless it improved its operational performance.

FT  22 JUL 93 / International Company News: Nortel sells UK marine cable arm
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS and JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALCATEL-Alsthom has agreed to buy STC Submarine Systems, the UK-based
underwater cable business of Canada's Northern Telecom, for about Pounds
600m (Dollars 899m).
If it clears regulatory hurdles in London and Brussels, the acquisition will
form part of Alcatel Cable, creating the world's largest underwater
telecommunications cable group, with estimated total sales of about Ecu800m
(Dollars 727m) last year.
Alcatel-Alsthom said that the deal would expand Alcatel Cable's geographical
coverage in a rapidly growing market. 'It is a very dynamic market as a
result of the growth of international telecommunications,' the company said.
The sale is a further stage in Northern Telecom's rationalisation of its UK
STC business, acquired in 1990. The company, which last month forecast a
second-quarter loss and replaced its chairman, has been under pressure to
focus on core businesses.
Besides STC, Northern Telecom has no other undersea cable activities. In the
past two years it has largely disposed of STC's distribution, service and
cable manufacturing concerns.
Mr Ian Craig, president of NT's European division, said: 'This has been in
prospect for some time. We are concentrating our UK business on switching,
transmission, radio and microwave: this deal means no lessening of our
commitment to the UK in those fields.'
Alcatel stressed the benefits to be gained from pooling the two groups'
research and development activities. With research in undersea cables at the
leading edge of fibre-optic technology, it expects the acquisition to
strengthen other aspects of its business.
The new group's main competitor for undersea cables are AT&amp;T, the largest US
operator and telecoms manufacturer, and Fujitsu of Japan. The purchase
reflects Alcatel's determination to strengthen its European base as the EC's
telecommunications market is opened to competition.
Alcatel Cable has been increasing its market share following the acquisition
at the beginning of 1992 of the cable business of AEG, the German industrial
group.
Analysts in Paris said the purchase would increase the debt of the Alcatel
cable subsidiary, which is estimated at more than FFr5bn (Dollars 862m). But
they did not expect any dilution of earnings this year.
STC Submarine Systems, which is based in Greenwich, London, had sales of
Ecu300m in 1992 and has about 1,200 employees. Alcatel Cable has annual
sales of more than Ecu5bn and employs about 28,000 people.
Mr Craig claimed Northern Telecom got a very good price for the sale. 'We
might have settled for substantially less three years ago.'
In 1990, Northern Telecom paid Pounds 1.9bn for STC, and the submarine
systems division is estimated to account for about 20 per cent of the sales
of the former group. The sale leaves Northern with 5,200 employees in the
UK.

FT  22 JUL 93 / International Company News: NTT Data may seek listing on
Tokyo SE
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By AGENCIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NTT Data Communications System, the computer software services arm of Nippon
Telegraph and Telephone (NTT), may be floated on the Tokyo stock exchange
next year, agencies report.
Mr Masashi Kojima, NTT president, said he would like the move to be made as
soon as possible: 'Everything will depend on the market's condition and we
have to choose the right time'.
NTT Data became an independent entity within NTT, Japan's large
telecommunications group, in 1988. By the end of the current year to March
1994, it will have business reports for five consecutive fiscal years as
required by the Tokyo stock exchange.
In addition to the disclosure criterion, the exchange requires 'a great
number of outstanding shares' and a good spread of shareholders, but the
exchange does not disclose specific numerical criteria.
Mr Kojima expected the proceeds of the flotation to ease the subsidiary's
heavy burden of interest payments.
NTT Data is Japan's biggest company specialising in computer system
integrations. It enjoyed sharp sales and profit growth during its first
three years.
Although the weakness of the economy has slowed sales growth in recent
years, the company was weathering the recession comparatively well because
of its large share of sales to the public sector, the company said.
Initial investment for each project sometimes amounted to hundreds of
billions of yen because half NTT Data's business involved leasing of
computers together with software. This inflated the company's need for
funds, and has resulted in a heavy financing burden, the company said.
For the year ended March, 1993, NTT Data's sales rose 10 per cent to
Y433.5bn (Dollars 4bn). Pre-tax profits tumbled 34 per cent to Y10.2bn.

MARION Merrell Dow, the pharmaceuticals group 70 per cent-owned by Dow, the
large US chemicals company, yesterday reported earnings down 85 per cent, to
Dollars 29m from Dollars 197m, for the second quarter to 30 June.
The company was hit by a special Dollars 180m restructuring charge for its
US business. It was also affected by falling sales of its leading medicines.
Without the special charge, net income would have been down 20 per cent at
Dollars 158m, according to the company. Mr Fred Lyons, president and chief
executive, pointed out that the results were better than during the first
quarter.
Turnover for the quarter fell 17 per cent to Dollars 750m from Dollars 908m.
Sales of the heart drug Cardizem, its best-selling medicine, dropped 9 per
cent to Dollars 210m, after US patents expired last year. However, its new
once-a-day Cardizem CD generated sales of Dollars 125m, up 166 per cent.
Seldane, an anti-histamine, generated sales down 11 per cent, from Dollars
296m to Dollars 263m. Sales of Nicoderm, the smoking cessation patch, fell
71 per cent to Dollars 24m against last year's figure. Sales of Nicorette
gum dropped 60 per cent to Dollars 40m.
Research and development spending for the quarter fell from Dollars 125m to
Dollars 115m, while sales, general and administrative spending dropped from
Dollars 286m to Dollars 270m.
Earnings per share fell from 70 cents to 10 cents.
Johnson &amp; Johnson, the US pharmaceuticals and consumer group, posted
second-quarter earnings up 9.5 per cent, to Dollars 495m from Dollars 452m.
Turnover increased 3.8 per cent to Dollars 3.54bn from Dollars 3.41bn.
However Mr Ralph Larsen, chairman and chief executive, said sales growth had
been slowed by weak economies in several markets, the strength of the
dollar, and healthcare reforms in several important international markets.
The consumer division's sales rose 1.6 per cent to Dollars 1.18bn from
Dollars 1.17bn.
Domestic turnover rose 1.2 per cent to Dollars 608m from Dollars 601m.
Turnover at the pharmaceuticals division rose 3.3 per cent to Dollars 1.12bn
from Dollars 1.1bn. In the US, it increased 9.5 per cent to Dollars 428m,
due to the introduction of new products such as Procrit, a treatment for
anaemia, and Leustatin, a medicine for hairy cell leukaemia.
These gains were offset by a decline in sales of Hismanal, an
anti-histamine. Non-US sales fell to Dollars 691m from Dollars 692m because
of healthcare reforms.
Sales of the professional division, which markets wound products, medical
equipment and dental and ophthalmic products, increased 6.3 per cent to
Dollars 1.24bn, from Dollars 1.17bn.
Earnings per share rose 10.3 per cent to 75 cents, from 68 cents.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MAYTAG, the US appliances group which owns Hoover Europe, yesterday reported
a 12 per cent increase in second-quarter net income, helped by more
efficient production in North America.
It reported net income of Dollars 21.3m, or 20 cents a share, compared with
Dollars 18.9m, or 18 cents, in the same period of last year - in spite of a
rise in its effective tax rate from 36 per cent to 41.6 per cent.
Sales totalled Dollars 753.3m, down 2.2 per cent, which the company said was
due to currency conversion factors, the sale of its microwave oven business,
and lower vending equipment sales.
In the first quarter, Maytag took a Dollars 30m charge to cover the costs of
a Hoover travel promotion in the UK which backfired.
First-half net income, including that charge, totalled Dollars 10.8m,
compared with a Dollars 263m loss last year after accounting changes.

non-recurring items.
A 3 per cent increase in turnover from a year ago, to Dollars 1.75bn, was
driven almost entirely by higher volume, with modest price rises largely
offset by currency factors, the company said. The healthcare division saw a
12 per cent increase in turnover, driven by a 15 per cent increase in drug
sales. Sales of animal health products grew 2 per cent, while turnover in
consumer healthcare products declined 2 per cent.
'This volume growth, combined with improved product mix and our ongoing
effort to control expenses, is resulting in our income growing considerably
faster than our sales,' said Mr William Steere, chairman.
Operating costs were cut to Dollars 988.7m from Dollars 1.2bn a year before,
while spending on research and development rose from Dollars 214m to Dollars
231m. The company's figures were boosted by a Dollars 60m pre-tax gain from
the sale of its 40 per cent interest in Minerals Technologies, partially
offset by restructuring charges of Dollars 33m.
Earnings per share rose to 79 cents a share (73 cents excluding the net gain
from the share sale), up from 66 cents a year ago.
First-half net income of Dollars 582.8m was ahead of the Dollars 234.6m of
the first six months of 1992, which was struck after accounting changes
reduced reported results by Dollars 283m. Pfizer's shares closed at Dollars
60, up Dollars  5/8 on the day.
Pharmaceutical sales at Bristol-Myers Squibb fell 1 per cent during the
second quarter compared with a year ago. The company blamed the drop on
lower sales of its Capoten cardiovascular drug and government
cost-containment measures in Germany and Italy.
However, sales of consumer healthcare products, medical devices and
nutritional products all rose strongly, resulting in a 3 per cent growth in
sales overall, to Dollars 2.8bn.
Net earnings rose to Dollars 520m, or Dollars 1.01 a share, up from Dollars
488m, or 92 cents a share, in the same period in 1992. First-half net net
income was Dollars 1.1bn, or Dollars 2.12 a share, against Dollars 789m, or
Dollars 1.53, last year.

FT  22 JUL 93 / International Company News: Disposals gain boosts General
Dynamics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GENERAL DYNAMICS yesterday reported a 58 per cent rise in second-quarter
earnings from continuing operations, while fellow US defence contractor
Northrop reported a 4 per cent increase in net income.
General Dynamics, which has been shrinking through asset sales to cope with
huge overcapacity in the US defence industry, reported earnings of Dollars
57m, or Dollars 1.80 a share, from continuing operations. These are against
Dollars 36m, or 82 cents in the same period last year.
Sales totalled Dollars 793m, down from Dollars 852m.
The latest quarter was boosted by a non-recurring gain of Dollars 9m, or 28
cents, from the recognition of previously-deferred gains from asset sales.
The per-share earnings figure was helped by the company's repurchase last
July of some 30 per cent of its stock.
The nuclear submarines business increased the earnings rates for 688 class
and Trident vessels, while the armoured vehicles business lifted income due
to productivity increases and expanded production for foreign markets.
Businesses which General Dynamics classifies as discontinued, but not yet
sold, earned Dollars 4m, compared with Dollars 50m a year ago, when the
figures included Dollars 44m from businesses sold in the past year.
For the six months the company reported earnings from continuing operations
of Dollars 98m, up from Dollars 66m.
Northrop, meanwhile, reported second-quarter income of Dollars 53m, or
Dollars 1.12 a share, compared with Dollars 51m, or Dollars 1.08 a share.
Sales totalled Dollars 1.31bn, down 9 per cent on the same period of 1992.
The company attributed the increase in net income primarily to improved
operating profits in its aircraft business and a lower loss in missiles and
unmanned vehicles.
Figures in the second quarter last year were depressed by a Dollars 9m loss
provision.

RISING sales in the US and Asia helped Mitel, the Canadian telephone
equipment maker, to record a profit of CDollars 3m (USDollars 2.4m), or 2
cents a share, for the quarter ended June 25, writes Robert Gibbens in
Montreal. This compares with a loss of CDollars 7m, or 10 cents, a year

Mitel, which makes telecom switches, semiconductors and computer systems,
said productivity gains also helped.

<TEXT>
MARTIN Marietta, the US defence contractor which took over GE Aerospace in
April, recorded a 25 per cent rise in second-quarter net income due to a
first-time contribution from its acquisition.
Net income rose to Dollars 124m, from Dollars 99m in the second quarter of
1992, on sales up from Dollars 1.6bn to Dollars 2.6bn. Earnings per share on
a fully-diluted basis fell to Dollars 1.98 from Dollars 2.06, reflecting an
increase of 14.5m in the shares outstanding as a result of a convertible
stock issue connected with the GE transaction.
New debt associated with the takeover took gearing to 41 per cent by the end
of June, which the company described as 'manageable'.
For the first half, before the effect of a change in accounting for
retirees' health benefits, post-tax profits were Dollars 200m, or Dollars
3.62, compared with Dollars 174m, or Dollars 3.57, in the first six months
of 1992.
Around Dollars 1.2bn of sales in the second quarter came from the company's
new electronics division, forged after the takeover. This unit achieved an
operating margin of 9 per cent, compared with a 10 per cent margin in the
space division.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LSI LOGIC, the US semi-conductor manufacturer, reported record net income in
the second quarter, compared with a loss in the same period last year.
The turnround was achieved by increased revenues and tight expense controls.
Net income was Dollars 13.1m, or 27 cents per share, compared with a loss of
Dollars 5.9m, or 13 cents, in the same period a year ago.
The earnings were at the high end of Wall Street expectations.
Revenues in the second quarter advanced to Dollars 177.1m, up 16.6 per cent
from Dollars 151.8m in the second quarter a year ago.
For the first six months of 1993, net income was Dollars 23.7m, or 49 cents
a share, against a loss of Dollars 5.5m, or 12 cents, in the first half of
1992. Revenues were Dollars 346m, up 14.4 per cent from Dollars 302.4m in
the same period last year.
LSI, which specialises in Application Specific Integrated Circuits (Asics),
chips tailored for specific customer applications, said demand was 'healthy
in the second quarter with the US and European markets leading the way'.
'Increased revenues and tight expense controls were the primary reasons for
the company's improved financial performance in the second quarter,' said Mr
Wilfred Corrigan, chairman and chief executive.
'Operating expenses as a percentage of revenues were reduced to 27.3 per
cent in the second quarter of 1993 from 36 per cent in the second quarter of
1992.
'Operating income, pre-tax income and net income were all at record levels
in the second quarter of 1993.'

UNITED Technologies, the US high-technology group, reported a 12 per cent
drop in second-quarter net income as sharply lower profits at its Pratt &amp;
Whitney aero-engine business offset improved performances in most other
parts of the group.
Net income was Dollars 130m, or 89 cents a share, compared with Dollars
148m, or Dollars 1.03, for the same period last year. Revenues were Dollars
5.6bn, down from Dollars 5.7bn.
Mr Robert Daniell, chairman, said operating profits from businesses other
than Pratt grew 19 per cent, compared with last year.
Pratt, which has suffered from the downturn in the airline industry,
reported operating profits of Dollars 6m, down from Dollars 122m a year ago.
Revenues dropped from Dollars 1.8bn to Dollars 1.7bn.
Lower sales of engines and spares were offset by revenues from the
renegotiation of several aircraft leases relating to prior-year engine
deliveries.
Mr Robert Daniell, UTC chairman, said Pratt was showing an improvement from
the first quarter, with an increase in commercial engine parts orders in the
first six months.
UTC's flight division, which includes Sikorsky, the helicopter manufacturer,
produced operating profits of Dollars 96m, up from Dollars 63m, on revenues
of Dollars 898m, down from Dollars 983m.
Otis, the elevator group, made Dollars 98m, up from Dollars 84m on revenues
of Dollars 1.14bn compared with Dollars 1.12bn. Carrier, the air conditioner
company, made Dollars 85m, down from Dollars 93m, on revenues of Dollars
1.24bn, down from Dollars 1.27bn. Automotive made Dollars 53m up from
Dollars 42m, on revenues of Dollars 640m against Dollars 633m.
For the six months UTC had net income of Dollars 194m, or Dollars 1.31 a
share, compared with Dollars 242m, or Dollars 1.79 last year before
accounting changes.

SPRINT, the US tele-communications group, reported a 58 per cent increase in
second-quarter net income from continuing operations, due to strong growth
in its long-distance operating income.
Income from continuing operations was Dollars 165m, or 48 cents a share,
compared with Dollars 104m, or 31 cents, a year earlier. This excludes a
Dollars 44m, or 13 cents a share, after-tax gain it made last year from the
sale of telephone properties in Ohio. Revenues rose 9 per cent to Dollars
2.8bn.
Net income totalled Dollars 157m, or 46 cents, compared with Dollars 148m,
or 44 cents.
Sprint, the third-largest long-distance carrier in the US, said this
business saw operating income of Dollars 121m, against Dollars 45m last
time. The profits were a slight improvement on the first quarter.
Revenues rose 10 per cent to Dollars 1.51bn, compared with Dollars 1.38bn a
year ago and Dollars 1.49bn in the first quarter. Minutes of use rose 9 per
cent on a year ago but were down 1 per cent on the first quarter.
Mr William Esrey, chairman, said the record long-distance results reflected
the introduction of new products.

<TEXT>
COLGATE-Palmolive, the US consumer products group, yesterday reported a 14
per cent increase in second-quarter earnings, despite weak economic
conditions in most of the developed world.
The company had net income of Dollars 142.4m, or 86 cents a share, compared
with Dollars 124.4m, or 75 cents, in the same period of last year. Sales
dipped 1 per cent to Dollars 1.78bn, due to currency fluctuations, though
unit volume was steady with a year earlier.
Mr Reuben Mark, chairman, said the earnings increase was due to the
company's commitment to increased profit margins. This had been achieved by
reducing overheads, streamlining worldwide manufacturing, and 'the continued
shift of product mix to our more profitable product categories'.
The gross profit margin rose from 47.1 per cent to 48 per cent, and the
after-tax return on sales moved up from 6.9 per cent to 8 per cent.
The company's biggest business - oral, personal and household care -
achieved 'healthy sales advances' in the developing world, which helped
offset decreases in the mature economies. Latin American sales were up 11
per cent.
Although European sales from this segment fell 10 per cent because of poor
economic conditions and currency factors, operating profit percentages
improved thanks to restructuring. US sales were down 4 per cent in unit
terms and 6 per cent in dollar terms.
However, Colgate said this was a considerable improvement on the first
quarter.

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GTE, the largest local telecommunications group in the US, yesterday
reported a 6 per cent increase in second-quarter net income. It was helped
by solid growth in telephone calling volume, but held back by a Dollars 74m
pre-tax charge for job cuts.
The company announced net income of Dollars 438m, or 46 cents a share,
compared with Dollars 412m, or 45 cents, in the second quarter last year.
Revenues dipped from Dollars 5.06bn to Dollars 4.92bn.
The revenue dip reflected 'lower government-communications sales and
continued competitive price reductions to domestic long-distance companies,
which offset solid volume growth in telephone operations'.
The charge for the voluntary job severance programme worked through at
Dollars 46m, or 5 cents a share after tax. GTE said when this was excluded,
earnings per share rose 13 per cent to 51 cents.
Mr Charles Lee, chairman, said telephone operations had a strong quarter,
with healthy volume growth and lower domestic operating costs.
For the six months, net income totalled Dollars 898m, or 94 cents a share,
compared with Dollars 805m, or 88 cents in 1992 before accounting changes.
Revenues totalled Dollars 9.74bn, up from Dollars 9.89bn.
In telephone operations, minutes of use of GTE's network for long-distance
calling grew at an annual rate of 7.5 per cent, while total access lines
increased 4 per cent.
Around 6,400 employees, or nearly 8 per cent of the domestic telephone
operations' workforce, accepted various voluntary separation programmes
during the period. This will reduce future operating costs by more than
Dollars 250m annually.
Revenues from the telecommunications products and services business, which
includes cellular telephones, saw operating income rise to Dollars 87m from
Dollars 57m, on revenues down at Dollars 995 from Dollars 1.08bn.
The increase in income was attributed to higher revenues and efficiencies in
mobile cellular, as well as cost reductions in the government systems
business.

Net revenue rose to Dollars 1.44bn from Dollars 1.39bn while operating

First-half results were distorted by extraordinary charges this year and

COMPAQ Computer's earnings more than tripled in the second quarter as the
company gained ground in the personal computer market.
The group also reported record sales for the fourth consecutive quarter of
Dollars 1.63bn, a 97 per cent increase over the Dollars 827m for the same
period last year.
Net income rose to Dollars 102m, or Dollars 1.21 a share, at the high end of
analysts' estimates. In the same period last year net income was Dollars
29m, or 35 cents.
'With this record-breaking performance we are continuing to move Compaq
toward our goal of becoming the number one PC manufacturer in the world,'
said Mr Eckhard Pfeiffer, president and chief executive. Compaq ranks number
three behind IBM and Apple Computer.
The group said its share of the world market increased significantly. Unit
shipments were up about 150 per cent over the second quarter of 1992 while
worldwide PC market unit shipments rose about 25 per cent.
European revenues were up 58 per cent, Compaq said, making it the slowest
growth market for the company.
Operating expenses increased substantially, with costs of sales jumping to
Dollars 1.2bn from Dollars 577m in the second quarter of last year,
reflecting the increased sales volume. Compaq said it had increased spending
on expanding its distribution channels, research and development and
advertising, compared with the first quarter. 'These increased expenditures
represent a strategic investment, to reach a greater number of customers
with a broader range of products,' the company said.
In late 1991, Compaq abandoned its traditional 'premium pricing' and
initiated an aggressive pricing strategy to win market share. Since then it
has launched a broad range of low-priced PCs, sparking an industry-wide
price war.
'Compaq will continue to aggressively pursue market share with a significant
range of competitively priced leadership products,' Mr Pfeiffer said.
Later this year, the company will introduce a new line of powerful 'servers'
for use in PC networks, as well as a new line of PCs designed and built by
Compaq aimed specifically at customers in the small office and consumer
market segments, he added.
For the first half, Compaq reported net income of Dollars 204.6m, or Dollars
2.44, compared with Dollars 74.3m, or 88 cents, in the first half of 1992.
Revenues jumped to Dollars 3.2bn from Dollars 1.6bn.

FT  22 JUL 93 / International Company News: The challenge bestowed by excess
 -A look at Karl Otto Pohl's role at Sal Oppenheim
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A former central banker in his early sixties recently landed what may count
as the perfect job: part-time chief executive of an ancient, aristocratic
bank which has so much money it does not know quite what to do with it.
The man is Mr Karl Otto Pohl, president of the Bundesbank for 12 years until
July 1991, and the bank is Sal Oppenheim, the largest and one of the oldest
of Germany's select breed of private banks.
'I am no big private banker,' confides Mr Pohl. 'I am something of an
outsider.'
Outsider though he may claim to be, he looks thoroughly at home in the
private banking world.
Anointed in May this year as 'speaker' of the bank's elite board of
personally liable managing directors, Mr Pohl spends just over half his time
on the affairs of the bank, which was founded in the year of the French
revolution.
'I see myself not as chief executive of the bank but as chairman,' he
explains. 'I chair the board meeting. I represent the bank in the outside
world.
'I bring this heterogeneous troupe together,' he continues, alluding to his
fellow partners and to the 50 members of the Oppenheim and related families
who own the bank in its entirety.
'Together with Alfie (Baron Alfred von Oppenheim, chairman of the bank's
supervisory board), I develop a strategy for the bank,' he says.
The strategic problem is easy to identify: what to do with the Cologne-based
bank's vast capital resources. With more than DM1bn (Dollars 500m) in 'core'
equity capital, Sal Oppenheim dwarfs fellow German private banks such as B.
Metzler or Trinkaus &amp; Burckhardt. Its balance sheet is as big as that of
leading UK merchant banks such as Schroders or Kleinwort Benson, and more
than twice as big as Rothschild's. But with around 700 employees, it has
only a fraction of the staff of many less well-capitalised institutions.
While other German banks are struggling to comply with capital adequacy
rules requiring a minimum of 4 per cent core capital, Sal Oppenheim has 12
to 13 per cent. This is down from a peak of 18 per cent after some recent
acquisitions, 'but it is still too high,' Mr Pohl concedes. Core capital of
'DM300m-DM400m would be enough for a bank of this size,' he says.
Although the Oppenheims have always been prosperous, this superfluity of
capital dates back only a few years, to 1989. In the bank's 200th
anniversary year, it decided to sell its majority stake in the Colonia
insurance company.
The proceeds of the sale to the French Victoire group have never been
disclosed, but the figure is authoritatively rumoured to be in excess of
DM4bn. Of this, a quarter went to the tax authorities. A further DM1bn-plus
went directly to Oppenheim's 50 shareholders. The balance went to the bank
and core capital jumped overnight from DM180m to more than DM1bn.
For Sal Oppenheim, the sale of the holding has ensured the bank will be able
to remain independent for generations to come. Although there are formally
dozens of institutions in Germany classified as private banks, most are now
majority owned by larger institutions - for example, Trinkaus &amp; Burckhardt
is controlled by the Midland Bank and Schroder Munchmeyer Hengst by Lloyds
Bank.
Oppenheim, owned by sixth- and seventh-generation family members, is one of
the few that are totally independent: another, much smaller example is the
Frankfurt-based Metzler bank, owned and managed by 11th-generation family
members. But, thanks to the disposal of the Colonia stake, Oppenheim is in a
class of its own.
This is underscored by the five-fold increase in the bank's core capital.
This is the main measure of a bank's balance sheet power, providing the
resources for future growth via new lending business. However as Mr Pohl
explains, 'of course our lending business did not quintuple as well'.
Despite the bank's ancient business links to 90 per cent of Germany's
largest companies, there was not enough good quality credit business around.
'Our future is not in classical commercial banking,' Pohl reflects, 'the
margins are too small. We will carry on in this area but it simply isn't the
business of the future.'
The search was on for a new strategy. With the help of the McKinsey
consulting firm, Mr Pohl and Baron Alfred set in motion a process of
restructuring which has divided the bank's business into four main areas.
The first is straightforward commercial lending; the second, financial
markets activities - including trading in currencies, equities and futures
and options; the third is private client services; and the fourth is asset
management for institutional investors (with more than DM20bn under
management).
If this gives the bank a more rigorous structure - each of the four
divisions has been made a separate profit centre for the first time in the
bank's history - it does not solve the problem of how to deploy the bank's
capital profitably.
Acquisitions may provide the answer: in the past two years Sal Oppenheim has
bought a Zurich-based fund management company and has spent DM200m buying
the Hypobank Rheinboden, a mortgage bank. But these alone do not give a new
dimension to the bank's business.
One area of potential expansion is Anglo-American-style merchant banking
business. 'Astonishingly, in view of our corporate connections,' says Mr
Pohl, 'we play only a very small role in merchant banking. We want to build
this one up.' This may mean - although Mr Pohl is not prepared to comment on
this - buying a London-based merchant bank.
The problems of the bank which has too much money are far from pressing, and
for Mr Pohl, the search for a new direction for Sal Oppenheim is less than a
full-time occupation. The former central banker spends nearly half his time
outside the bank, busying himself with 12 other boardroom posts and a host
of honorary positions.

FT  22 JUL 93 / International Company News: AMR, USAir back in black in
second term
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
TWO of the biggest US airline groups - USAir and AMR, owner of American
Airlines - struggled back into profit in the second quarter of this year
after the effects of a prolonged price war and recession in their home
market.
However, both companies said their results were disappointing, and Mr Robert
Crandall, AMR chairman, called current profit margins 'wholly inadequate'.
He added that AMR's revenues and costs remained 'clearly out of balance. In
the absence of either stronger levels of demand or higher yields, present
trends will not result in satisfactory earnings.'
Mr Seth Schofield, president of USAir, said his company was 'encouraged' by
its improvement in operating income, but added: 'We are disappointed that
our earlier expectations for the second quarter did not materialise due to
sluggish economic conditions.'
The results of both companies were ahead of analysts' expectations, and
helped to push up their shares.
Mr Kevin Murphy, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, said: 'It's an improvement
after last year's devastating fare wars, but they're still not operating in
full recovery mode.'
AMR reported net earnings of Dollars 47m, or 39 cents a share, after taking
a Dollars 79m charge for the retirement of 31 DC-10 aircraft and an
adjustment which added Dollars 67m to passenger revenues.
Leaving aside these factors, earnings were Dollars 59m, or 55 cents a share,
compared with a loss of Dollars 65m, or 86 cents, on a comparable basis in
the 1992 quarter.
For the half-year as a whole, net earnings were Dollars 25m, compared with a
net loss of Dollars 175m in the first six months of 1992.
Revenues in the second quarter reached Dollars 4.21bn, up from Dollars
3.59bn, while the company's yield (the average paid by each passenger to fly
one mile) rose by nearly 11 per cent to 13.77 cents (13.31 cents before the
one-off revenue adjustment). Operating costs climbed by 8 per cent to
Dollars 3.85bn
USAir, in which British Airways has a minority stake, reported net income of
Dollars 5.8m in the three months to the end of June, compared with a loss of
Dollars 131m in the same period in 1992, although this was reduced to
Dollars 12.6m after the cost of paying dividends on preference shares.
The loss per share, after the preference dividend, was 23 cents against
Dollars 3.07 a year ago.
Revenues advanced by 7 per cent to Dollars 1.81bn, while operating expenses
fell by nearly 10 per cent to Dollars 1.75bn. The half-year net loss was
Dollars 72.1m, against Dollars 224.9m in 1992.

windfall

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IRI, Italy's biggest state holding company which has total group debts of
about L73,000bn (Dollars 45.68bn), is set to receive around L2,000bn in
unpaid tax credits.
The funds, part of a L3,500bn package of tax credits being reimbursed to
various companies, should give the group a breathing space pending further
restructuring and asset sales.
The IRI group lost L4,809bn after tax last year. Losses at many operations -
notably Ilva (steel) and Iritecna (construction and general contracting) -
have continued to rise, while expected privatisation receipts have so far
fallen behind schedule. As a result, the group expects to lose about
L5,200bn in 1993.
Details of which companies would receive the tax credits were due to be
announced last night following cabinet approval this week for a decree
authorising repayment.

FT  22 JUL 93 / International Company News: Saab sees a return to profit
next year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TROLLHATTAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SAAB Automobile, launching its all-important 900 model, said yesterday it
saw the possibility of a return to profit next year for the first time since
General Motors of the US bought a half-share in the company in 1989.
Mr Keith Butler-Wheelhouse, the Briton brought in by GM last year to head
Sweden's traditional rival to Volvo, declined to make a firm forecast,
warning that the gloomy outlook in world car markets, especially in Europe,
where sales have slumped 17 per cent this year, continued to cloud Saab's
prospects.
But, he added, 'I prefer to say that we have brought down the break-even
point for the company to about 80,000 units sold per year and we intend to
sell significantly more than that next year. So if nothing else changes we
should be in the black next year.'
Mr Butler-Wheelhouse acknowledged that the success of the new 900, which
will compete against the Mercedes C class, the BMW 3-series and the Audi 80,
was vital for Saab, which in the past four years has accumulated losses of
more than SKr10bn (Dollars 1.25bn) and swallowed a further SKr8bn in two
capital injections by GM and its Swedish co-owner, Saab-Scania.
He insisted that Saab was not in a 'do or die' position. He said even if
sales did not hit the high levels Saab hoped for, the company had the funds
and the support of GM and Saab-Scania to continue to develop its next new
model, an upgrade of the luxury 9000 car, due within five years.
The chief worry for Saab is the steep decline in its main markets. It sold
only 35,800 cars in first half of the year, compared with 86,800 in all of
1992 and 109,500 in 1989. Sales in the US - its biggest market - and Europe
were down nearly 30 per cent.

FT  22 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Eve Group improves 27% to Pounds 4.15m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRE-TAX profits of Eve Group, the specialist contractor, jumped by 27 per
cent from Pounds 3.26m to Pounds 4.15m during the 12 months to the end of
March - in spite of enduring the 'worst construction industry recession for
half a century.'
The company has increased dividend payments every year since it floated on
the USM in 1986. The final dividend this time is raised to 7.3p making a
total of 10p (9.7p) for the year.
Following the better-than-expected results, the shares rose 23p to 400p.
Profits would have been even higher but for a Pounds 500,000 provision
against its commercial property interests. Turnover rose from Pounds 39.1m
to Pounds 53m while earnings per share increased by more than a fifth from
22.5p to 27.4p.
The outcome also included Pounds 265,000 representing five months' profits
from Graham Bros, the Middlesbrough-based specialist electrical contracting
and engineering company, acquired last autumn.
Eve's strength is its specialist contracting division, which is one of only
a handful of companies carrying out work for the National Grid Company,
erecting transmission lines and pylons. The division also erects
transmission towers for radio, telecommunications and television companies.
The division's turnover and profits have remained strong in spite of
recession in the rest of the construction industry, which has prompted a
sharp fall in margins in Eve's general building business.
Construction profits, which includes specialist contracting and general
building, rose by a quarter from Pounds 3.15m to Pounds 3.95m. This was
despite a fall in the division's profit margins from 8.6 per cent to 8.2 per
cent, said Mr Gerald Hough, managing director.
Profits from Trakway, which provides portable roadways for construction
sites, exhibitions and concerts, rose from Pounds 656,000 to Pounds 2.88m,
helped by an increase in pop concert work, said Mr Hough.
Property development losses rose from Pounds 104,000 to Pounds 576,000 after
the Pounds 500,000 provision.
Construction industry analysts said they expected the group to make profits
of at least Pounds 5m this year, provided there were no further provisions.

First Maryland Bancorp, the wholly owned US subsidiary of Allied Irish
Banks, yesterday reported profits up 27 per cent to Dollars 31m (Pounds
20.6m) for the second quarter of 1993.
This brings the outcome for the first six months of the year to Dollars
59.5m, an increase of 34 per cent over the comparable period of 1992, and
representing a return on assets of 1.29 per cent and a return on equity of
16.47 per cent.
Improvement in net interest margin from 4.48 per cent to 4.7 per cent, an
increased volume of earning assets and higher non-interest income, including
securities gains, were the principal contributors to the rise in profits,
directors explained.

FT  22 JUL 93 / UK Company News: National Express buys East Midlands Airport
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NATIONAL EXPRESS, the motor coach services group, is expanding into airport
management with the acquisition for Pounds 27.1m of East Midlands
International Airport at Castle Donington, Leicestershire.
The purchase marks the first privatisation of a leading regional airport.
East Midlands is the fourth largest in the UK.
Last month National Express emerged as the leading bidder of four contenders
for the airport, and has since been negotiating the price with accountants
KPMG Peat Marwick, which acted for the local authority owners.
National Express is funding Pounds 3.75m of the consideration through a
placing of 1.8m new shares, which represent about 5 per cent of the capital,
at 210p a share. Yesterday the shares moved up 8p to 223p.
The issue has been underwritten by Morgan Grenfell; Smith New Court
Corporate Finance are brokers.
However, the bulk of funding comes from the group's own cash holdings
(Pounds 5.8m) and from Pounds 17.5m of medium-term bank debt. This borrowing
means the group is taking on gearing which, by the end of this year, should
be 50 per cent.
The airport's net asset value is Pounds 10.3m higher than the purchase price
at Pounds 37.4m and it is generating cash. In the year to last March its
pre-tax profits rose to Pounds 3.36m on turnover of Pounds 17.8m, from
Pounds 2.48m on turnover of Pounds 15.8m.
As an investment the airport stands alone. Mr Adam Mills, deputy chief
executive, said that any capital expenditure until about the end of the
century could be funded internally. 'The airport has the resources to do
most things it wants to do in the foreseeable future.'
National Express takes over the airport from the Derbyshire, Leicestershire
and Nottinghamshire County Councils and the Nottingham City Council. The
other contenders to buy it were a management buy-out team, Lockheed, the US
group, and Regional Airports, a privately-owned UK company.

FT  22 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Verity seeks Pounds 5.9m in move to reduce
borrowings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER FRANKLIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN A move to reduce gearing and strengthen its balance sheet, Verity Group,
the USM-quoted company which manufactures and distributes Wharfedale and
Mission loudspeakers, is seeking to raise Pounds 5.9m net of expenses via
two placings and an open offer.
Directors said that, in the light of the forecast loss of up to Pounds 4.25m
for the year to June 30 and the resultant diminution in net assets, an
injection of fresh funds was necessary to secure the company's future.
Verity proposes to raise Pounds 4.9m via a placing and open offer of 83.3m
shares at 6 1/2 p each.
Qualifying shareholders will be entitled to apply for the new shares on a
19-for-23 basis. Verity's management is committed to subscribe (subject to
clawback) for Pounds 1.8m of the shares.
There will be a separate placing of 15.4m shares, also at 6 1/2 p, with
Tomei, a Hong Kong-based manufacturer of electronic and electrical products
which acts as a distributor for Verity's products.
Because Tomei has conditionally subscribed for a fixed number of new shares,
shareholders will not be entitled to a clawback.
Following the placing Tomei will hold about 7.7 per cent of Verity.
In addition to the offers, Bank of Scotland will subscribe Pounds 1.5m for
preference shares in Verity Investments, a wholly owned subsidiary.
The proceeds of the subscription will be used to fund the purchase of the
Huntingdon property from Centralforce Holdings, from which Verity acquired
the Mission and Cyrus brand names in September 1992.
These proceeds will in turn be used by Centralforce to repay the mortgage on
the Huntingdon property and to reduce group borrowings.
As a result of the proposals Verity's gearing will be reduced to about 34
per cent and net assets increased to some Pounds 7.8m.
In order to enhance the marketability of Verity's shares, the directors have
applied to the Stock Exchange for a full listing. Dealings are expected to
begin at August 19.

FT  22 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Worthington looks to current year
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
WORTHINGTON Group, the Staffordshire-based textile accessories company, saw
pre-tax profits tumble 38 per cent over the 12 months to March 31.
The decline - from a restated Pounds 1.06m to Pounds 652,000 - reflected the
continuing disappointing performance of the button wholesaling and trimming
operations.
However, Mr Jack Grant, chairman, sounded an optimistic note: 'The first
quarter of the current year has seen significant improvements in all trading
operations . . . problems in our button business appear to have now been
resolved.'
Turnover improved to Pounds 14m (Pounds 13.6m). Comparisons for the previous
year were restated to allow for the merger accounting of Hulme Holmberg and
Atorp, acquired in August.
Mr Grant said the group planned further expansion, both through organic
growth and acquisition.
The final dividend is held at 1.1p making a total of 1.6p (1.4p), payable
from earnings of 3p (4.3p) per share.

FT  22 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Renishaw shares fall on profit warning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES IN Renishaw, the engineering group that makes specialist measuring
equipment, fell 34p to 240p yesterday after the group warned its profits
would not meet market expectations.
It said pre-tax profits for the year ended June 30 would be 20 to 25 per
cent lower than the maintained Pounds 9m expected by the City.
Germany, France and Japan, its main markets, were still suffering from
worldwide recession. The group relies heavily on selling its measuring
probes to makers and users of the industrialised world's machine tools.
Mr Ben Taylor, assistant chief executive, said Renishaw had also sold
forward some of its export earnings, including most of its D-Marks, just
before sterling was forced out of the ERM last September.
Had this approach not been adopted, devaluation would have allowed
translation gains to draw the sting from the lack of trading recovery in
Japan and Germany.
Renishaw said that while profits would fall below market expectations this
year, there were 'indications of increased activity in the North American
market, growing demand in the UK and indications of substantial potential
demand in the Far East.'
Demand for new products, like its scanning products and microscopes, were
also 'encouraging'.
The group would also benefit this year from sterling's departure from the
ERM.
At the end of June the group realised sales in Germany and Japan
particularly had been softer than expected.
Mr Taylor said margins had also come under some pressure, particularly from
some customers who had promised discounts to their customers and wanted
Renishaw to share some of the pain.

At June 30 1993 net asset value of Scottish American Investment stood at
163.1p, a rise of 10.9p over the December 31 figure.
On June 30 1992 the value was 135.6p.
There is a second interim dividend of 1.15p, making 2.29p to date. Directors
are forecasting an increase of 6.4 per cent to 4.63p in the total, which
will more than compensate shareholders affected by the reduction of tax
credits.
In the first half of 1993 income totalled Pounds 8.31m (Pounds 8.81m). Net
revenue amounted to Pounds 3.84m (Pounds 4.58m) for earnings per share of

Exmoor Dual Investment Trust, the split-capital vehicle which concentrates
its portfolio primarily on similar such trusts, reported a net asset value
of 34.8p per ordinary share as at May 31, down from the value of 63.2p a
year earlier.
The figure of 61.1p per income share showed little change over the 12
months, while net asset value per zero coupon preference share improved from
158.4p to 178.9p.
Attributable revenue for the nine months to end-May amounted to Pounds
602,455 (Pounds 558,975) for earnings of 6.83p (6.34p) per income share.
A third interim dividend of 2.7p makes an unchanged total to date of 7.8p.
Directors reiterated that the total for the year would be maintained at
10.55p but that the distribution would probably have to be reduced next
year.

A near-Pounds 2m advance in pre-tax profit was achieved by PSIT, the
property investor and developer, in the year to March 31.
In the UK, it concentrated on managing and upgrading existing properties and
planning for future development where the signs of recovery were more firmly
based.
Income from investment properties came to Pounds 18.6m (Pounds 16.6m), and
from investment securities it was Pounds 2.15m (Pounds 2.88m). Interest
payable was Pounds 11.1m (Pounds 11.4m) and pre-tax profit Pounds 8.67m
(Pounds 6.72m).
Earnings per share worked through at 5.1p (4.04p) and the final dividend is
2.625p for a total of 4.125p (3.75p).
The value of property investments was static at Pounds 235m. UK properties
had fallen in line with the market but that was offset by increases
overseas. Net value per share rose from 140p to 142p.

FT  22 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Medeva moves to rebuild investors'
confidence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MEDEVA, the rapidly growing UK drugs company that has suffered a halving in
its share price since issuing a profits warning on Monday, yesterday said it
will eschew 'further major acquisitions' for the time being.
In a letter to shareholders, Mr Bernard Taylor, chairman, said: 'The scale
of the fall in the company's share price would appear to reflect wider
concerns than could be accounted for by the revised profits forecast alone.'
The board recognised the company would have to face 'new constraints' with
an overriding challenge being to rebuild investor confi-dence.
Medeva's share price fell a further 8 1/2 p yesterday to 102p, bringing the
fall to 114p since Monday, when the company said it would make pre-tax
profits of between Pounds 43m and Pounds 47m in 1993, about Pounds 10m below
market expectations.
Rebuilding confidence would 'crucially depend' on the company's actual
profit performance in the future.
Mr Taylor said that the company's growth had been based on acquisition and
organic growth.
Medeva describes its strategy as capturing synergies between companies it
acquires, on revitalising products it buys, developing new products and
investing in the resulting growth opportunities.
'Looking ahead, the board believes that shareholders will be looking for
renewed evidence of the success of this strategy before any further major
acquisitions are contemplated.'
After its Pounds 94m rights issue in April, which repaid all debt and left
the group with a strong balance sheet, Medeva said it had about Pounds 100m
which it could deploy in acquiring more companies.
The company would still make 'smaller scale tactical acquisitions', the
letter said.

FT  22 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Hanson warns of mine closures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HANSON, the Anglo-American conglomerate, said the US miners' strike had cost
its Peabody subsidiary Pounds 29m in the three months to June 30 and warned
of permanent closures of certain mines and a 'noticeable effect on Peabody's
profit'.
Lord Hanson, chairman, said Pounds 15m of the loss occurred in June when a
total of 15 Peabody locations were on strike for part of the month and
extensive sabotage to equipment occurred. There were also slowdowns by union
workers at the mines that operated during the period.
He said that despite repeated requests, the United Mine Workers of America
refused to resume bargaining with the official multi-company bargaining
group, and appeared to be heading for a long confrontation.
'This will not only bring disastrous consequences for the employees involved
and possible permanent closures of certain mines, but, as already disclosed
at the recent Hanson EGM, will have a noticeable effect on Peabody's
profit.'
The strike at St Louis-based Peabody is part of a larger walk-out at mines
operated by a number of big US coal companies. The union said about 16,000
miners were on strike. The UMWA is trying to obtain guarantees that its
members can have jobs at new mines opened by Peabody and others when
existing mines run out of coal.
Lord Hanson said: 'The number of Peabody mines on strike, governed by the
labour contract with the UMWA, has now increased to 18 out of 22. Seven
other US mines, however, involving approximately half of Peabody's
production, are not affected and remain profitable.
'This strike is entirely a matter for the management of Peabody and the UMWA
to negotiate and settle, but unless the UMWA is prepared to start
negotiations immediately, Peabody's results for the three months ended
September 30 1993, could be affected at a similar rate.
'The UMWA is attempting to coerce Hanson into forcing Peabody to submit to
totally unacceptable terms, something we shall never do. Were a settlement
to be made on the terms demanded by the UMWA, Peabody's future
competitiveness and profit would be permanently blighted. Hanson is prepared
to accept the short-term costs to its shareholders to ensure Peabody's
long-term competitiveness.'
Hanson's shares closed 1 1/2 p lower at 232 1/2 p.

FT  22 JUL 93 / UK Company News: BA to franchise its brand name to smaller
airlines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH AIRWAYS is to franchise its name to small independent airlines,
starting with UK carrier Cityflyer, in a move that mimics the strategy of
its large US rivals.
Cityflyer will sell all its scheduled services under the British Airways
Express brand name. It will pay BA a royalty for its use and for marketing
services.
It will keep its staff and financial independence but switch to BA livery
and uniforms. The airline already has a sales and reservations deal with BA.
Mr Robert Ayling, BA managing director, said yesterday that the deal was
attractive because 'capital was not at risk and income is guaranteed.
'We have seen this work successfully in the US and we are looking at at
least one other possible (similar) transaction'.
American Airlines, for example, franchises the name American Eagle to small
carriers which then feed local services into American large hub airports.
BA's next target for a franchise is likely to be Maersk, the Danish carrier.
The two airlines have close links and between them control Brymon European
Airways, formed last year from the merger of Plymouth-based Brymon Aviation
and Birmingham European Airways.
Cityflyer formerly operated flights for the holiday tour operator
International Leisure Group, until that went bust in 1991. It was saved by a
management buy-out and now flies to Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany,
Ireland, the Channel Islands and within the UK.
The deal is part of BA's strategy to cut costs in less profitable
activities. Recent changes include moving maintenance from Heathrow to
Cardiff Airport, and the establishment of BA Regional to operate flights out
of non-London airports with staff on lower wages.

FT  22 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Dunhill shares fall on disappointing
quarter
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES IN Dunhill Holdings fell 27p to 340p yesterday as Lord Douro,
chairman of the luxury goods group, said that results for the first quarter
had been 'disappointing', and that there was little sign of recovery in its
key markets, particularly Japan.
Speaking at the annual meeting he said: 'A convincing recovery would now be
needed to avoid a significant reduction in operating profit from that of
last year.' He added that it was too early to assess the outlook for the
full year with any precision.
Lord Douro also said that the reconstruction of Dunhill, Richemont and
Rothmans was proceeding on schedule.
Shares in Dunhill fell almost 12 per cent from 379p to 355p on June 4 as the
group revealed lower pre-tax profits for the year to March 31 and issued a
warning for the current term.
Mr John Yates, chairman of Airsprung Furniture, told the annual meeting that
management accounts for the first quarter showed sales ahead of last year;
profits, however, were lower, albeit in line with budget. The shares fell
19p to 469p.

FT  22 JUL 93 / UK Company News: NW Water gets 90% take-up for scrip
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
NORTH West Water, the privatised water company, yesterday said that it had
received elections for its enhanced scrip dividend in respect of some 322m
shares - about 90 per cent of its issued capital.
The company, which is unlikely to have any mainstream corporation tax
liability for some time due to substantial capital allowances, made the move
to help it eliminate unrelieved advance corporation tax. It intends to
direct the money saved to its international business.
The enhanced scrip option was equivalent to a dividend of 21.405p. Swiss
Bank Corporation, which agreed to purchase new shares at a value equivalent
to 20.9769p, yesterday said that shareholders representing about 81m shares
(25 per cent of the elections) had accepted its offer.
The reference price determining the number of new shares issued under the
scheme will be announced next Wednesday.

FT  22 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Warburg seeks Pounds 91m via bond issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SG WARBURG Group yesterday launched an Pounds 80m convertible bond, quickly
increased in size to Pounds 91m, in its first capital raising exercise since
1987.
Mr Simon Leathes, chief financial officer, said that while the group has no
pressing need for capital, 'we were concerned that two years from now we
might want additional capital and market conditions may not be right'.
He did not specify how the group intends to use the funds except to say it
will probably be devoted to the investment banking division, where Warburg
hopes to expand its trading for its own account and its derivatives
business.
The offering will count as Tier 2 capital for regulatory purposes, raising
the total capital for Warburg in that category to Pounds 240m.
Warburg does not publish its capital ratios for regulatory purposes, the
internationally accepted measure of a bank's balance sheet. But Mr Leathes
said the group is 'well above' regulatory minimums.
However, the ratio of Warburg's shareholders' funds to gross assets, an
important measure of balance sheet strength, fell in the past year from 5.9
per cent to 4.6 per cent. Mr Leathes said that the ratio at the end of 1992
had been unusually high by historical standards. When all the shares on the
new issue are converted, that ratio will rise to just above 5 per cent, he
said.
In the year ended March 31, Warburg earned a return on capital in the
investment banking division of 10.3 per cent, 8.7 per cent after
discontinued operations. That is lower than the group average return on
capital of 14.7 per cent for the year just ended.
Warburg's brokers, Cazenove, had sounded out institutional shareholders in
June but found there was limited support for such a capital raising exercise
at that time.
The securities, which may be called at par by Warburg in 1998, carry a
coupon of 6.5 per cent and are convertible into Warburg shares at 854p, a
premium of 18 per cent above the share price at launch of 729p.
Warburg's shares yesterday closed 10p lower at 719p.
If all the shares are converted, they will dilute existing shareholders'
stakes by just under 5 per cent.

FT  22 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Page proposal for Hoskins lapses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A PLAN by Mr Adam Page, founder of Midsummer Leisure, to reverse some of his
businesses into Hoskins Brewery, one of Britain's smallest quoted brewers,
has formally lapsed although both parties say they remain committed to the
deal, writes Catherine Milton
Completion of the deal to inject three Fatty Arbuckle's theme bars into
Hoskins in return for 41 per cent of its equity, was subject to notice being
sent to shareholders by July 16.
This date could not be met partly because of calls for clarification from
the Stock Exchange and partly because of Hoskins' own due diligence. The
delays meant that three successive completion deadlines were missed.
Hoskins said: 'Discussions are still continuing with a view to resolving the
outstanding matters in relation to the acquisition.

FT  22 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Looking to be a bigger wheel - AirBoss
Ground Engagement's expansion plans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AIRBOSS Ground Engagement, which makes a unique puncture-proof
wheel-and-tyre system, is launching a new phase of expansion that could
generate rather more City interest than normal for a company with 19
employees and two years of losses.
AirBoss will begin volume production at its Didcot factory in the next few
weeks of a new size of tyre designed for the front of backhoe loaders, or
for all four wheels of a dumper or articulated wheel loader.
The AirBoss tyre, launched in 1991, has already made tracks in the market
for skid-steer loaders, small multi-purpose machines such as the European
market-leading Melroe Bobcat.
The tyre comes in slot-together non-pneumatic sections bolted to a
specially-designed rim, and is marketed as the answer to punctures.
But according to Mr Andy Helby, AirBoss managing director, 'It bugged us
that we only had a tyre for skid-steers. We knew that we'd be unlikely to
get rich like that.'
The entrance of Abingdon-based AirBoss into a much bigger potential market
might look like something of interest only to construction equipment
insiders, but its corporate history suggests otherwise.
AirBoss is the wholly owned trading subsidiary of Select Industries, known
until 1991 as Courtwell Group. Courtwell was formerly the Bear Brand hosiery
group, and was created in early 1990 when Bear Brand bought Leisure
Investments for Pounds 80m.
In May 1990, Leisure Investments, whose interests included the Aspinall
casino in London and the Lingfield racecourse, went into receivership.
Courtwell sold its remaining businesses and became a cash shell with Pounds
3m.
After examining about 60 business prospects, Courtwell settled on the new
Australian-invented tyre system, and in 1991 obtained the European licence
from Perth-based AirBoss.
The result is that some 14,000 former shareholders in a range of activities
including casinos and hosiery now hold shares in Select, whose only business
is the Abingdon company.
So far, investors have not had much to show for their shares. Select
incurred pre-tax losses of Pounds 1.36m and Pounds 1.18m in 1992 and 1991
respectively, and paid no dividends.
Yet, helped by the good prospects for the wheel system, Select made a
successful Pounds 4.5m rights issue last year to fund the continuing
development of new wheel sizes. AirBoss, which retains rights to most of the
rest of the world apart from North America, is injecting a further Pounds 5m
over the next three years to increase its stake in Select to 50.5 per cent.
Mr Edward Vandyk, the former Courtwell chairman who is now chief executive
at Select, says he does not expect the group to be profitable until late
1994 at the earliest.
Shares in Select are currently traded under rule 535(2), but Mr Vandyk says
the company has applied to join the Unlisted Securities Market to have a
more 'credible' market position.
But it does not need to raise new money, and still has to receive Pounds 6m
of the money already raised. 'This is the sort of project that has to be
equity financed,' says Mr Vandyk.
Select's turnover has already jumped from Pounds 91,000 in 1991 to Pounds
465,000 last year, and is running at a higher rate again this year as the
tyre's advantages become better known and AirBoss develops its European
sales network.
AirBoss is talking to a number of backhoe loader producers about the tyre
system, but recognises that it needs between 20 and 25 wheel sizes to
exploit fully the construction equipment market.
The challenge for AirBoss will be to speed up new product development, in
co-operation with AirBoss in Australia.
'The big wheels need a lot of R&amp;D,' says Mr Helby. 'We started with
scaled-up versions of the smaller wheels, but there are different challenges
as the segments rub together . . . but we do expect to get quicker.'

FT  22 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Reduced finance charges help Aim improve to
Pounds 3.6m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRE-TAX profits at Aim Group, the maker of aircraft interior fittings,
improved from Pounds 3.11m to Pounds 3.63m in the year to April 30, but the
rise was entirely attributable to reduced finance charges.
Operating profit declined to Pounds 4.01m (Pounds 4.43m) as margins were
eroded in a difficult market with aircraft cancellations and postponements.
Mr Jeff Smith, chairman and chief executive, said: 'Under the circumstances
we were pleased it was such a small decrease.'
Finance charges fell to Pounds 378,000 (Pounds 1.32m) on the back of the
disposal in May last year of the contracting division. The sale realised
Pounds 2.7m net cash including the release of some bank debt.
Turnover fell to Pounds 41.7m. Total sales in the previous period were
Pounds 58m, including Pounds 15m from contracting.
Aim completed one refurbishment order for the VC10 within the first two
months of its year and only started another, for the SAAB 2000, this spring.
Mr Smith said: 'At the end of the day, more and more people are flying and
you clearly can't fly without aircraft. Quite what the timing of any upturn
will be is obviously a question of opinion and debate. My view is 1995 but I
could be wrong.'
The company did not adopt the new FRS 3 accounting standard. Mr Smith said
he thought the standard would have been 'confusing'. Under the new rules a
Pounds 181,000 one-off gain on the disposal of the contracting division
would have been included in pre-tax profits instead of being taken below the
line.
Mr Smith said: 'I am quite happy with criticism if it comes. Given the
timetable of the disposal it makes a great deal more sense to do it this
way.'
A recommended final dividend of 6p brings the total for the year to 7.5p
(6.5p). Earnings per share improved to 16.6p (13.7p).

FT  22 JUL 93 / France starts with the cream: First bites at the
privatisation menu
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE handful of companies chosen yesterday to launch France's ambitious
privatisation campaign this autumn suggests the government is keen to do the
easy bit first.
Its strategy is to achieve a smooth start to the sale of the 21 companies
named in its privatisation programme, while maximising receipts to the
state. The companies selected yesterday - among the most attractive assets
in the state's industrial portfolio and with potential combined receipts of
FFr77.5bn-FFr94bn (Pounds 8.80bn-Pounds 10.7bn) - are likely to represent
the best chance of success.
Elf-Aquitaine, the country's biggest industrial company and one of the
world's largest oil groups, Rhone-Poulenc, one of the largest international
chemicals companies, and BNP, one of the country's biggest banks, are the
principal companies in the first batch for the privatisation block.
Banque Hervet, a relatively small retail bank with an estimated market value
of about FFr1bn was the fourth company on the list. The state insurance
groups, UAP and AGF, which had been tipped to be part of the first group
were omitted, a reflection of the current difficulties of the French
insurance market.
The three principal groups are familiar to domestic and international
investors. They all have quotations on the Paris bourse, following the issue
of shares and 'certificats d'investissment' (non-voting preference shares).
This will facilitate the task of pricing the issues.
With the exception of Elf, they have existing shareholders which could
provide the basis for a 'noyau dur' - a core of stable investors. The
inclusion of BNP may prepare it to be a core shareholder in other privatised
groups.
'This is pretty much the cream of the state sector,' said one merchant
banker in Paris. 'The problems will come further down the list.'
For the moment, however, the effects of recession in France and difficulties
in some of their sectors may have given the cream a slightly sour taste.
Mr Loik Le Floch-Prigent, chairman of Elf, has warned of a 25 per cent fall
in operating profits in the first half of the year - the result of weakness
in the basic chemicals market and of sharp price falls in fertilisers.
'The major difference from the previous period is that these businesses took
a sharp move downwards and we didn't have the opportunity to compensate with
other areas,' Mr Floch-Prigent said yesterday.
Similarly, Mr Michel Pebereau, who took over as chairman of BNP in May,
warned last month of a substantial fall in profits for the first six months
of the year. Faced with a sharp increase in small business failures and the
depressed property market, profits are expected to fall to FFr500m-FFr550m
in the first half, compared with FFr1.33bn.
Rhone-Poulenc is confronted with what Mr Jean-Pierre Tirouflet, its finance
director, describes as 'one of the most serious crises in the chemicals
industry in recent history'.
But the various candidates have been implementing restructuring programmes
which, according to analysts, have strengthened their operations and left
them well placed to benefit when economic conditions improve.
Since Mr Floch-Prigent was appointed chairman in 1989, Elf has expanded its
downstream activities through a series of acquisitions. These include the UK
assets of Amoco and Occidental. Under Mr Jean-Rene Fourtou, Rhone-Poulenc
has reduced its exposure to the troubled fibres sector and base chemicals,
and expanded its presence in higher value products such as pharmaceuticals.
BNP has embarked on a cost-cutting programme and has been quicker than most
of its French counterparts to provide for bad loans.
As a result of their various strategies the groups believe the worst is
over. Analysts expect Rhone-Poulenc's net profits to increase from FFr1.5bn
in 1992 to FFr1.8bn this year. Elf is expected to see some recovery in
healthcare and to have a lower interest bill because of reduced rates.
The various groups have been busily preparing themselves for sale.
Rhone-Poulenc has made a series of disposals to reduce a debt:equity ratio
of 80 per cent at the end of last year. Earlier this month, for example, it
sold its 35 per cent stake in Roussel-Uclaf, the speciality chemicals
business, for about FFr4.5bn.
At BNP, Mr Pebereau has brought his experience of privatisation from Credit
Commercial de France, which was successfully sold under the previous
conservative government in 1987. Yesterday, Elf reduced the minimum number
of shares that investors can buy from 100 to 10. For the French Sid,
therefore, a stake in the oil group would now cost about FFr4,000 compared
with FFr40,000.
The French government is confident of adequate domestic demand. Officials
cite the success of the Balladur bond, issued earlier this month. The bond,
which is convertible into equity in privatisation issues, attracted
FFr110bn, almost three times the target amount.
Ultimately, of course, the appetite for privatisation shares will depend on
the price. But with trickier propositions further down the list - such as
Bull, the indebted computer manufacturer, and Usinor Sacilor, the
loss-making steel producer - the government will be keen to ensure that the
price is right for the first on the block.
Michel Pebereau         Chairman Banque Nationale de Paris
                        Estimated value of state's 73% holding:
                        FFr 25-29bn
Loik Le Floch-Prigent   Chairman Elf-Aquitaine
                        Estimated value of state's 51.4% holding:

FT  22 JUL 93 / STC costs Northern Telecom Dollars 500m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON

<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NORTHERN Telecom, of Canada, has outlined a big restructuring plan,
including a Dollars 500m write-down on its investment in STC, the UK
telecommunications group which it bought two years ago.
The action is aimed at correcting deep-seated problems in its global
telecoms equipment business.
Announcing a second-quarter loss of more than Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m), the
Toronto-based company said it was selling its submarine systems division to
Alcatel of France; cutting its workforce by 9 per cent; and launching a
drive to improve its digital-switching software. The STC write-down amounts
to almost a third of the Dollars 1.8bn of goodwill established at the time
of its acquisition in March 1991.
Mr Jean Monty, who became Northern's chief executive earlier this year, said
that the investment in STC 'has not lived up to expectations in the
short-term'.
Of the total restructuring package, Mr Monty said: 'It's good to bring it
all at the same time and make sure that we have nothing to hide. We're
tackling the issues head-on.'
Weak economic growth in Europe has hit sales and earnings of the STC
businesses, which are now integrated into Northern's own operations. But Mr
Monty said that the writedown and the sale of the submarine business 'does
not detract from our determination to penetrate the European market'.
The company has set aside Dollars 158m for a project to improve the software
used in its central-office switches, the computers which route telephone
calls. A compartmentalised team of more than 1,000 people has been set up to
produce a platform for new software features. The new products are due out
in 1995.
The extent of Northern's problems is evident in its financial performance.
It suffered a second-quarter loss even before the Dollars 940m after-tax
special charges, and has raised the possibility of another loss in the third
quarter. The loss before the extraordinary items was Dollars 88m, or 36
cents a share, compared with earnings of Dollars 72.3m, or 28 cents, a year
earlier. After special charges, the loss was Dollars 1.03bn, or 28 cents.
Revenues dropped 4 per cent to Dollars 1.87bn. Gross margins slumped to 30.8
per cent of revenues from 39 per cent last year.
The biggest drop in revenues and margins was in central-office switches.
Price competition is intense, especially in North America and Europe. Sales
of switching software also fell.
Mr Monty described the second-quarter operating results as 'extremely
disappointing and unacceptable'.
Investors shared his opinion, driving Northern's share price down by Dollars
1 5/8 to close at Dollars 22 7/8 in New York.

FT  22 JUL 93 / Lonrho to get Pounds 109m from sale to Krupp
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LONRHO, the international trading group, will receive DM282.5m (Pounds
109.4m) for its 50 per cent stake in the trading company which it owns
jointly with Krupp-Hoesch, the recently merged German steel and engineering
group.
The German group has agreed to buy out the stake which Lonrho acquired from
Krupp in 1988 for DM200m. Shares in Lonrho rose 1 1/2 p to close at 130 1/2
p after it announced the deal, which will cut the UK group's gearing from 35
to 27 per cent.
Mr Dieter Bock, Lonrho's joint chief executive, said no more significant
disposals were planned. The group has reduced its debt from more than Pounds
1bn a year ago to about Pounds 480m by selling property in Germany and its
newspapers and Volkswagen/Audi sales operation in the UK.
Lonrho had been approached by Krupp-Hoesch, formed last year by the merger
of Germany's second and third-largest steel producers. Mr Bock said the
enlarged group wanted to expand the trading arm, which would have required a
big injection of capital from Lonrho to maintain its stake - 'basically, it
was worth more to them than to us'.
Although Mr Bock would like to focus Lonrho on three main business areas -
mining, hotels and agriculture - he said the group would continue to be
involved in trading activities such as motors - particularly in Africa,
where there was scope for joint ventures.
Lonrho's shares fell to a low of 59p last year after the group announced the
controversial sale of a stake in its Metropole Hotels group to the Libyan
government.
Mr Bock acquired 18.8 per cent of the company after paying Mr Tiny Roland,
Lonrho's chief executive and driving force, a premium 115p per share for
half of his 15 per cent stake in December, and then supporting a rights
issue. Mr Bock, a property developer and hotel owner, was confident he would
be able to announce the appointment of two or three non-executive directors
by the end of the year.
Asked about the source of his money, he said simply: 'My businesses.' He
controls private companies registered in Germany and the Netherlands, and
said he was well known to Deutsche Bank, the German parent of Morgan
Grenfell, the London merchant bank.
He is working almost full-time on Lonrho business, but has not yet been
paid. The new non-executives would decide his salary. 'I can't work forever
without a salary, but I am receiving dividends and I can wait.'

FT  22 JUL 93 / Sage shares plummet after profits warning on US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SAGE Group's share price fell by 119p to 385p yesterday after the
Newcastle-based business software company issued a 'short-term' profits
warning related to two subsidiaries operating in the fiercely competitive US
market.
The company said that Remote Control International, acquired recently, had
incurred restructuring costs. It had also brought forward development
spending on a new version of its Telemagic software for organising business
contacts, a product designed to work under Microsoft's Windows.
DacEasy, the group's US accounting software subsidiary, had been adversely
affected by the introduction of competitors' Windows products ahead of its
own, due out this autumn. Costs had been reduced and the products
repositioned in less price-sensitive market segments.
The rapid growth of Windows-based software in the US has caught several
software companies by surprise. Products designed to run under Windows now
account for about 60 per cent of the US software market.
Sage is the second UK-based high growth stock this week to be marked sharply
lower following a profits warning. On Monday Medeva's shares lost almost
half their value after the fast-growing drugs company said profits would
fail to meet expectations.
Sage said its pre-tax profits and earnings per share for the year to
September 30 'will be lower than general market expectations', but ahead of
those reported for last year.
Last year it made Pounds 8.85m pre-tax on turnover of Pounds 27.3m.
Following a 24 per cent increase in interim profits, most industry analysts
had been expecting a full-year figure of Pounds 10.8m-Pounds 11.1m. After
the announcement, forecasts for the current year were downgraded to around
Pounds 9.5m, with earnings of about 32p per share.
Most analysts, however, left pre-tax forecasts for next year little changed
at about Pounds 12m.
Mr David Goldman, Sage's chairman, said the company had decided to issue the
statement 'to lay some ghosts'. He emphasised that the measures at RCI would
enhance its prospects and the company remained 'absolutely confident' about
next year's outlook.
'It is a minor blip,' said Mr Goldman.

FT  22 JUL 93 / The last picture show from Elstree
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE credits are finally rolling at Elstree Studios. No longer will cries of
'darling' and 'luvvie' echo around the sets.
After more than 20 years of changes of ownership and rescues, the British
Hollywood, in the unlikely setting of Borehamwood, Herts, a million miles
from Sunset Boulevard, is to close.
This time even Superman, Indiana Jones and Luke Skywalker, all characters
who have walked the sets, seem unlikely to save the studio where the first
British 'talkie' was made and Laurence Olivier, Ralph Richardson and James
Mason made their screen debuts.
The last important feature film to be made there was, perhaps appropriately,
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, completed in 1989. Since then the
studios have been used for television films and commercials.
Elstree's owner, Brent Walker, the property and leisure group struggling
under Pounds 1.3bn of debts, said yesterday that the facilities had been
'substantially under-utilised'.
Despite 'vigorous efforts' Brent Walker had been unable to find a buyer for
the studios, and could no longer afford to subsidise film production there.
The news brought an outcry from the beleaguered British film industry. Mr
Wilf Stevenson, director of the British Film Institute, said the closure
'will be damaging to the long- term prospects of a UK cinema industry'.
After Brent Walker bought the studios in 1988, for Pounds 32.5m it sold part
of the land for a Tesco superstore.
In 1990 Brent Walker agreed with the local council, Hertsmere, that the site
would be used for film-making for the following 25 years. It could forfeit a
Pounds 10m bond if the property is used for other purposes.
Brent Walker is now applying to the Land Tribunal for an amendment of its
agreement so that it can redevelop the town-centre site.
Brent Walker has promised development will be 'as sympathetic as possible',
although this may be poor recompense for the Borehamwood locals, used to
seeing Harrison Ford and Sean Connery in the newsagents.
Fade . . . and CUT.

FT  22 JUL 93 / EBRD confirms dropping of claims against Attali: Italy
nominates former PM Amato as new bank chief
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT and ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Bank for Reconstruction and Development yesterday confirmed it
is to drop claims against its former president, Mr Jacques Attali, over his
alleged financial mismanagement.
The announcement came as Mr Guiliano Amato, former socialist Italian prime
minister, became the latest nominee in the vote for the bank's new
president, which had been due to start today.
According to the terms of his resignation agreement, Mr Attali has waived
his rights to a termination fee, worth more than Pounds 147,000, in exchange
for a 'full and final settlement' over any claims the bank might have in
connection with the critical audit report submitted by Coopers &amp; Lybrand
last week. The bank's board is due to meet in London today to discuss the
further implications of the audit report.
Mr Attali's official resignation came as the final deadline was due for
nominations for his successor. As intense behind-the-scenes negotiations
continued, the bank announced the deadline for nominations had been extended
by a week 'to allow the governors more time for consultation'.
The bank yesterday confirmed that at least three candidates have been put
forward. These include Mr Amato and Mr Leszek Balcerowicz, former Polish
finance minister. Sources within the bank have also suggested Mr Henning
Christopherson, currently EC economics commissioner, Mr Jaques de Larosiere,
governor of the Bank of France, and an unnamed Russian candidate are
possible candidates. Mr de Larosiere is judged the strongest candidate and
is supported by the Germans and British. Although the new president will be
elected for a four-year term, there is speculation that he might serve only
the remaining two years of Mr Attali's tenure, opening the way for a
compromise candidate.
'There is a strong feeling here that the French have a moral right to
succeed Mr Attali,' a source at the bank yesterday said. 'This will not be a
vote in the normal sense. It will be all about negotiations and pressure.'
Italy decided to nominate Mr Amato at the last minute, after high-level
consultation with its partners.
However, as Italy already has a deputy-chairmanship through Mr Mario
Sarcinelli, a former senior treasury official, election of Mr Amato as
president would require a reshuffle of the board.
The move suggests Mr Amato's sudden candidature is a compromise move by
Italy to produce a prestigious figure who might appeal to Anglo-Saxons, the
French and Germans as well as eastern Europeans.
The Germans are believed not to have put forward their own candidate in case
this would undermine their campaign to have the European central bank
located in Frankfurt.
Similarly, the British are believed to be supporting the French candidacy in
return for a previous agreement to locate the bank in London. However, some
east European countries have argued that they have a moral right to see an
east European in the post.
Once nominations have close, the list of candidates will be put to the 56
board members, representing 54 countries. The votes will be weighted
according to the number of shares each country holds.
The vote, which will be conducted by post, is expected to take about 21
days.

FT  22 JUL 93 / Investors win case over home income schemes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INVESTORS who were given bad financial advice when trying to free the
capital in their homes won a decisive victory in the High Court yesterday.
The judgment, in favour of increased compensation rights, could result in
more than 150 compensation claims for a possible total of Pounds 2m, based
on average payouts to date by the Investors Compensation Scheme.
The compensation scheme is managed by the Securities and Investments Board,
the regulatory body for the financial services industry, for claims made
against authorised investment firms in default.
The High Court ruled against the scheme by deciding that investors who took
out a home income plan before August 28 1988 - the day the scheme came into
existence - would be entitled to compensation in some cases. The ICS had
argued that claims could only be made by investors who took out a plan on or
after that date.
Lord Justice Glidewell and Mr Justice Cresswell also ruled that the ICS was
not right to halve the amount of compensation to a surviving spouse.
Mr Richard Barnett, of solicitors Barnett Sampson, which represents 450 home
income plan claimants, said that the decision showed 'good common sense' and
that the ICS had unfairly interpreted the rules for payouts.
The SIB welcomed 'the clarity given to difficult technical issues' but said
it was studying the judgment to see how it would apply before making a
decision on whether to appeal.
The ICS has paid compensation of Pounds 16.3m to 1,300 home income plan
investors to date, an average of just over Pounds 12,500 per claim. The
maximum compensation given by the ICS is Pounds 48,000 per claim.
Investment-linked home income schemes were marketed in the 1980s as a way
for investors - most of them elderly - to unlock capital in their homes by
taking out mortgages and investing the proceeds in investment bonds, which
were meant to cover the repayments and provide extra income.
Returns were affected by poor stock market performance, which left many
investors in financial difficulties. Where the schemes were sold as 'safe'
investments, investors have a case for compensation against their advisers
for negligent advice.
In the case brought before the court, Aylesbury Associates was the firm of
advisers which had given bad advice to an investor to take out a home income
plan. The High Court said the investor was eligible for compensation for
losses made as a result of further bad advice relating to the plan given
after August 28 1988.

FT  22 JUL 93 / Three top groups head French sell-off agenda: Government
lists 21 companies for privatisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING and DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE French government yesterday named three of the country's leading
industrial and financial groups to spearhead its ambitious privatisation
programme.
The planned sale of Elf-Aquitaine, the oil group which is France's largest
industrial concern, Rhone-Poulenc, the chemicals group, and Banque Nationale
de Paris (BNP) could raise more than FFr90bn (Pounds 10.31bn), brokers
estimated last night. The first sale is due this autumn.
The three groups are among the biggest and most solid institutions in the
state sector and had been expected to figure among the first to be sold off.
The fourth concern named yesterday was Banque Hervet, a small
property-oriented bank, which acknowledged its surprise at being included in
the first wave of the state sell-off.
The scale of the share sale, aimed at international as well as French
investors, will depend on market conditions and whether the state decides to
sell its stakes entirely or in tranches. The proceeds will fund public
housing and infrastructure to help pull the economy out of recession, as
well as to restrain the budget deficit, estimated this year at FFr317bn.
Mr Edouard Balladur's government has named another 17 companies for sale.
Since many of these currently suffer losses - such as Bull, the computer
company, and Air France, the airline - it has set no deadline for the
completion of its programme.
The conservative government hopes in the longer term to reduce significantly
the size of what is western Europe's largest public sector after Italy.
Heads of the companies selected yesterday have said that privatisation would
not alter their strategies, which have allowed for partial sales of
state-owned shares even under the preceding Socialist government.
'I am the manager of the company, not the owner,' said Mr Loik Le Floch
Prigent, Elf's president, shortly before the sell-off announcement.
Privatisation will facilitate the raising of the new capital that the
heavily-indebted French state has been increasingly unable to provide.
Yesterday's announcement is to be followed within two weeks by the naming of
a special privatisation committee, which will value the four companies with
the help of domestic and international banking advisers.
The finance ministry did not exclude the possibility that the government
might make changes at the top of the four companies before privatisation.
By naming four companies in three different sectors for early sale, the
government has given itself the flexibility to decide in September which it
will float off first.
It is generally confident about the demand for privatisation shares,
following the success of the Balladur bond issue this month. The bond, which
can be converted into equity of privatised companies, raised almost three
times the target amount.
The privatisation bill allows the government to retain a golden share to
maintain strategic control over companies involved in sensitive sectors such
as energy, defence and high-technology. President Francois Mitterrand named
Elf among several companies which required 'extreme caution' in putting them
into private hands.

Zeneca would doubtless prefer to see its shares back above the 600p rights
price before announcing its first results as an independent company. But
even an upbeat message and a solid set of figures next week is unlikely to
give the market more than fleeting encouragement. The 4 per cent fall in the
shares this week - without good reason other than another bout of nerves
about the outlook for the pharmaceuticals sector - underlines that deeper
forces are at work. The company owes Lady Luck at least a vote of thanks for
making sure the downward lurch did not happen during the rights period.

FT  22 JUL 93 / The Lex Column: SG Warburg
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
After its abortive approach to the market last month, SG Warburg had to
ensure that any fresh attempt to raise capital was a conspicuous success.
Hence yesterday's Pounds 91m convertible bond issue was attractively priced
and targetted more to continental investors than the City institutions who
snubbed it in the first place. The fact that Warburg has persevered
underlines a need for additional comfort where capital is concerned.
Warburg does not publish its BIS ratios and says with astonishing candour
that the measure it does publish - shareholders' funds as a percentage of
year-end assets - is not very meaningful. But the ratio did fall to 4.6 per
cent from 5.9 per cent last year.
The new capital will also give Warburg flexibility in trading on its own
account. Notwithstanding the lavish fees it can expect to earn from BT3 and
corporate clients from Zeneca to Richemont, Warburg must focus more on
trading to improve on its woefully inadequate rates of return. The danger,
highlighted by yesterday's Group of 30 report on derivatives, is that such a
strategy also involves increased risk. One has to hope Warburg has learned
the lessons from last year's losses in the bond market.

If the French authorities are looking for lower German interest rates to
support the franc, they will not have had much encouragement from
yesterday's money supply figures. An M3 growth rate over 7 per cent leaves
the Bundesbank little leeway to relax without losing credibility.
The bank could point to the strength of the D-Mark and Germany's low bond
yields as mitigating worry about inflation. It also notes that consumer
prices, which rose 4.2 per cent in the year to June, are a lagging
indicator. But higher insurance premiums mean July's figure, due next week,
will again be high. That will make it even harder for the bank to lower
rates before the summer holidays.
Since the bank's money market repurchase rate is now only 40 basis points
above the discount rate, there is not even much scope for the kind of
piecemeal easing which has now become familiar. Besides, foreign exchange
markets increasingly consider that France's economic problems call for more
than the mere establishment of a slow downward trend in European interest
rates. Since the franc is at the bottom of the system, Germany could place
the onus on France to follow Denmark in raising rates if its currency hit
the floor. But France could then end up looking as silly as the UK did last
September.

FT  22 JUL 93 / The Lex Column: Northern Telecom
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Northern Telecom's foray into Europe always looked badly timed. By writing
down the value of its investment in STC the company has admitted as much.
Price erosion in the US is the main culprit behind yesterday's
second-quarter trading loss, but conditions in Europe have scarcely been
better since Nortel took a shine to STC in 1990. Having failed to build a
bridgehead in continental Europe as well, it has been if anything more
exposed than the indigenous competition.
While Nortel's overseas business will bear its share of restructuring,
though, restoring North America to profit will be the priority. Cutting
costs is an obvious first move. Making up lost ground in product and service
standards may prove more challenging. The drive to improve software
standards is overdue, but that effort could end up costing more than the
Dollars 158m (Pounds 105.3m) provided yesterday.
On that basis, the decision to sell STC's submarine cables business makes
perfect sense. Despite turning in decent profits, the business was never
much of a fit with Nortel's interests in switching and transmission
equipment. Disposal should bring in more than enough to cover the cash costs
of restructuring and software development. Always assuming, that is, that
the competition authorities in London and Brussels are happy to see Alcatel
leap-frog AT&amp;T to take the lead in submarine cables.

FT  22 JUL 93 / The Lex Column: Coal's black future
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It is hard not to feel a pang of sympathy for British Coal's management. The
corporation has made striking productivity improvements in recent years
without compromising safety. Overhead costs have been halved over the past
four years while colliery costs per tonne have fallen by 41 per cent in real
terms since 1985. Yet, as its annual results make clear, British Coal still
has a huge way to go before it could become a viable private sector
enterprise. Every move towards that goal, meanwhile, is picked apart in the
political piranha pool.
Undoubtedly, the more savagely the government allows British Coal to cut
capacity, the easier it will be to privatise the remainder. While its main
supply contracts remain in place until 1998, there is a profitable seam of
British Coal assets which could feasibly be sold. The snag is it may take no
more than a dozen pits to supply the electricity generators' needs, given
that 33m tonnes of surplus coal already sits in their stockyards. This,
though, would entail an even more drastic pit closure programme than the one
the government originally balked at. Moreover, after 1998 the risks will
multiply enormously. It will be difficult to negotiate a contract with the
generators on repeat terms; near-impossible to compete freely with overseas
open-cast coal.
British Coal has made a reasonable fist of managing the orderly decline of
the coal industry. The government will not find it easy to persuade anyone
in the private sector to pay to take it on.

FT  22 JUL 93 / Easy option or unnecessary risk: A look at the debate
surrounding the explosive growth of new financial instruments
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
They could be about to bring the world's financial system to its knees, or
they could be among the most beneficial products created by the financial
industry. The trouble is, so few people understand derivatives that the
debate about these new-fangled instruments has hardly got beyond a handful
of bank trading floors.
Derivatives - the term covers futures, options, swaps and a growing array of
more arcane products - are instruments whose value is based on some other
asset, such as a currency, interest rate or share price. An option on a
currency, for example, gives the holder the right to buy the currency at a
predetermined level from the person who sold the option: if the currency
rises on the foreign exchange markets, the value of the option will go up.
Options like these may be used by corporate treasurers and others to hedge
their future currency cashflows - or just to speculate.
To their supporters, such instruments have brought new flexibility to the
management of financial risks for companies, investors, government agencies
and others. To their critics, they have opened a Pandora's box, creating
complex risks that few users and traders of derivatives know how to handle.
The financial industry had its own say yesterday in the shape of a report
from the Group of 30, a Washington-based think-tank. It concludes that
derivatives make a 'favourable and substantial' contribution to economic
activity - though some banks need to think harder about how they manage the
risks attached to derivatives.
Other studies this year have reached a similar conclusion, including one
from the Bank for International Settlements, the Basle-based club of central
bankers. The view that derivatives have been generally beneficial could yet
be challenged, however, as financial regulators, particularly in the US,
continue to scrutinise the subject.
Derivatives have become popular because they make it possible to hedge or
take risks in a way that could not be done before, and because they make
existing hedging and risk-taking cheaper. Also, by using an interest-rate
swap, a company can change the structure of its liabilities, exchanging a
fixed-rate liability for a floating-rate one (the entity on the other side
of the swap - usually a bank - takes the opposite position). Such liability
management is entirely new.
The returns on assets can be shifted around in much the same way: a
shareholder could swap the return on equity for the return on, say, a
commodities index. Derivatives have thus given a whole new meaning to the
way companies, investors and others manage their assets and liabilities.
Derivatives have also brought down borrowing costs for large borrowers by
making it possible for them to take advantage of pricing inefficiencies in
different markets. For tax, regulatory or other reasons, a company may be
able to borrow more cheaply in a currency it does not need than in one it
does.
The World Bank, one of the biggest borrowers internationally, raised Dollars
3.6bn-worth of currencies for which it did not have a use in the 12 months
to the end of June, swapping the money into the dollars, yen and D-Marks
which it lends. This enabled it to reach a wide range of investors around
the world, says Ms Jessica Einhorn, the bank's treasurer: 'It allows us to
use the world's capital markets to diversify our borrowings into a pool of
currencies, and to lock in our borrowing at a lower cost.' The bank reckons
it saved 40 basis points (0.4 percentage point) a year in interest charges
in the past 12 months.
McDonald's, the US-based hamburger chain, uses the swaps market to reduce
the cost of financing new hamburger restaurants abroad. In Denmark last
year, a swap helped save 1.5 percentage points a year on the financing costs
of new restaurants. Mr Carelton Pearl, treasurer, says: 'I'm just trying to
get the lowest-cost hamburgers for our customers.'
Thriving markets have developed in swaps and other new financial products,
in the process creating one of the most profitable activities for the
handful of large banks which dominate the business. In the first half of
this year, trading profits at the biggest US banks climbed sharply, much of
it driven by derivatives.
Sophisticated computer systems and highly qualified staff are needed to
price derivatives correctly and to enable the banks which sell derivatives
to manage their own risks. This has limited the number of institutions able
to trade, and added a premium to their efforts. Companies and investors have
been prepared to pay the banks' big profit margins on such products for the
benefits they convey - a clear case of a technological leap forward that has
benefited those financial institutions which made the investment early
enough.
Derivatives look set to revolutionise the banking industry for other reasons
as well. The business of taking deposits and making loans - the traditional
credit intermediation process of banks - has declined as large companies
have turned to the securities and commercial paper markets to raise money
from investors directly. But by setting themselves up in the derivatives
business, banks have been making themselves useful again to big companies.
While loan growth has stopped or gone into reverse at most big commercial
banks in the US and UK, there has been a steady growth in the credit risks
taken on by banks through their derivatives activities.
The process has been most marked at the US banks JP Morgan and Bankers
Trust, which have moved fastest into the derivatives business. At Bankers
Trust, off-balance sheet credit risks from derivatives now exceed loans
recorded on its balance sheet. Bankers Trust and JP Morgan have become the
most profitable big commercial banks in the US, making a return on equity of
more than 20 per cent each last year. Other big banks struggled to get into
double figures.
It is not difficult to see why regulators have expressed concern at the pace
of growth in derivatives. Mr Gerald Corrigan, president of the Federal
Reserve Bank of New York, warned last year: 'High-tech banking and finance
has its place, but it's not all it's cracked up to be . . . The growth and
complexity of off-balance sheet activities and the nature of the credit,
price and settlement risk they entail should give us all pause for concern.'
The banking industry has hardly covered itself with glory in the past
decade, stumbling from the third-world debt crisis at the start of the 1980s
to the popping of the credit-induced bubble in property and other asset
markets at the end of the decade. If bankers are unable to handle credit
risks they have dealt with for generations, can they deal with the new risks
associated with derivatives?
In addition, the stock market crash of 1987 has left a lingering suspicion
of high-tech trading techniques. Computer-driven 'portfolio insurance',
which was meant to limit the risk of loss from a fall in share prices, was
suspected of having hastened the collapse in 1987. To critics, the safety
offered by the sort of hedging techniques used by derivatives traders could
turn out to be just as illusory.
There is some evidence to support this fear. Last September's currency
crisis in the European exchange rate mechanism led some interest rate
derivatives markets to dry up, making it impossible for derivatives traders
to hedge the risks they were running. The financial markets had proved more
volatile and less liquid than derivatives traders had assumed.
Although the prospect that a bank's trading strategy will go wrong prompts
the most frequent expressions of concern, the real danger from derivatives
probably lies elsewhere - in the lack of an adequate infrastructure to
support these fast-growing markets, and a shortage of people, including
senior bank executives, who understand derivatives.
The lack of infrastructure stems from the speed with which the markets have
grown: the legal, accounting and regulatory framework of the financial
markets has failed to keep up. Also, banks have put more effort into their
'front offices' (the traders and supporting computer systems which conduct
the business) than their 'back offices' (the administrative support
functions such as internal valuation and reporting, and settlement).
Without efficient administration, trading activities could founder. As Mr
Bill Rhodes, vice-chairman of Citicorp, says: 'Very often that's the one
thing that's missed. If there's one thing that concerns me, it's that the
back office is set up properly.'

FT  22 JUL 93 / Leading Article: Running Japan
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FOUR DAYS after Japan's inconclusive election, the shape of the likely
ruling coalition has still not emerged. Nor is it clear whether the net
result of these political upheavals will be a shift in power towards the
politicians, away from the bureaucrats who have effectively governed the
country during the past decades of Liberal Democratic party hegemony. Little
wonder, with at least one political party suggesting that budget-drafting
should become the prerogative of elected officials, that these are nervous
days at the Ministry of Finance.
Surely, the bureaucrats say, we have enough to concern us without worrying
whether Japan's pork-barrel politicians are about to undo a decade of fiscal
aus-terity in a spree of tax cuts in the run-up to a second elec-tion.
Inconsistently perhaps, the bureaucrats are also worried by the weak
economy: recent data on retail sales and the monetary aggregates suggest
that confidence remains depressed, while industrial output is still falling.
Moreover, the politicians are already judged to have conceded too much to
the US by committing the ministry to take further action, if necessary, to
reduce the trade surplus. Worse still, US administration officials may soon
be back demanding that the agreement be supplemented with numerical targets.
The bureaucrats should act while they can. Now more than ever, given the
current confused state of Japanese politics, the Ministry of Finance is in
charge.
The obvious way to revive the economy, and thus pre-empt the risk of panic
measures later on, is to ease monetary policy now. Policy remains much too
tight, given the depressed state of bank lending, while underlying
inflationary pressures remain non-existent.
The best way to block US demands for numerical and sectoral trade targets is
to pre-empt the inevitable complaint that Japan has failed to live up to the
spirit of the agreement. That means taking steps now to revive demand for
imports.
A possible way to prevent politically motivated tax cuts later in the year
would be for the ministry to propose a substantial, but temporary, income
tax cut now.
The combination of an interest rate cut and a temporary tax cut would thus
kill three birds with one macro-economic stone. And it could only add to the
Ministry of Finance's reputation for far-sighted prudence and political
savvy. This would serve the bureaucrats well when the horse-trading over
governmental responsibilities really begins.

The subject of the paper he was sitting? One of the most common offences for

Few if any Japanese diplomats have vaulted as effortlessly over cultural
barriers as did Kazuo Chiba, Japan's ambassador in London from 1988-91.
Mastering even the self-deprecating after-dinner funny, he is remembered
affectionately by many.
Now freed from what he calls his 'sanitised' diplomatic persona, Chiba
exceeded even his admirers' expectations yesterday when he launched a
pamphlet on EC-Japanese trade relations, co-produced by the Royal Institute
of International Affairs and its Japanese opposite number.
First, he set himself a tongue-twister few other Japanese would attempt, by
using 'irrelevant' and 'irreverent' in the same sentence.
Then he recalled how former French prime minister Edith Cresson had insisted
on telling Arthur Dunkel, the previous Gatt director general, in Chiba's
presence that 'les Japonais trichent, je le sais', not realising that he
understood French.
And finally he asserted that Karel van Wolferen, author of The Enigma of
Japanese Power, had 'lived 25 years with a Japanese woman as a partner but
without learning our language: no wonder he finds Japan an enigma'.
After which, perhaps feeling he had overdone it just a shade, he added:
'Let's forget about the 25-year partner. I understand she's a hairdresser.'

Let's hear no more carping from bankers about the Pacific hagfish. The
scales of justice have at last proved it innocent.
Pacific hagfish is the source of 'eel skin leather' used to make wallets,
which has been blamed for damaging the magnetic strips on credit cards. But
though the allegation has been swallowed hook, line and sinker by banks'
customer service staff, they caught a tartar in passing it on to Edward
Melvin.
An American biologist with special research interests in the hagfish, he
promptly investigated. The rumour just doesn't hold water, he now says. The
real culprit is the magnetic clasps fitted to many eel-skin wallets.

Mere heart surgery will not be a sufficient excuse for MPs to miss tonight's

On the government side, ailing cabinet ministers Michael Heseltine and John

Meanwhile, the fit in body, of whichever political persuasion, will be aware

be debated tomorrow - completely disrupting the planned annual cricket match

Even aficionados of the Personal columns of the Daily Telegraph could be
excused a degree of puzzlement at the abbreviation CIB which appeared
against four of yesterday's 11 entries.
Alongside expressions of deep gratitude to St Jude for lending a hand 'once
again' in some undisclosed enterprise, as well as the daily reading courtesy
of the Bible Society, were a selection of messages targeted at Westminster's
Eurosceptics and anyone else whose eyesight was up to it. 'Speak for us,
don't flinch, kill treaty', 'Unelected Euro-bureaucracy abhored', and other
such subtle morale boosters.
The Campaign for an Independent Britain's honorary secretary, Sir Robin
Williams, agrees that it is 'not our normal way of promoting ourselves'.
But, lacking a comfortable supply of central funds, the 2,300 plus
membership is 'encouraged to shoot off ammunition at any target they can
think of'.
Denied a referendum on Maastricht, some members apparently felt strongly
enough to finance personally their three-line entries.
Not previously alerted to the fruits of his branches' labour, Sir Robin's
response, when told that the entries were flanked by an appeal from a jilted
lover, was heartfelt.
'It really is forlorn that sort of advertisement, don't you think?'

FT  22 JUL 93 / Personal View: Challenge of balancing power in Bosnia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MATE BOBAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The general perception that the new political proposal for Bosnia and
Herzegovina is the demise of the republic is simply wrong. Rather, the
proposal to create a confederal form of government between the three
constituent peoples of Bosnia and Herzegovina represents a real hope for
peace, and possibly a last opportunity to prevent a permanent division of
the country.
The new plan is a variation on the Vance/Owen plan. It is being formulated,
as was the earlier plan, under the auspices of the international community.
Lord Owen and Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg are mandated by the European Community
and other parts of the international community to guarantee that the plan is
fair to all three sides.
The Owen/Stoltenberg plan will ensure the integrity of the Bosnian state,
while accepting the reality that has divided the country along three lines.
It will be a middle road between the two extremes: the yearning by the
Bosnian president, Mr Alija Izetbegovic, for a strong centralised state and
earlier claims by Mr Radovan Karadzic, leader of the Bosnian Serbs, that
Bosnia and Herzegovina should not exist at all.
The Owen/Stoltenberg plan will also have some fundamental elements of the
Cutilliero plan - creation of a confederate state delineated along ethnic
lines. The Cutilliero plan was signed by all three sides in Lisbon in March
1992. Regrettably, Mr Izetbegovic later rescinded his signature.
The eight-point Cutilliero criteria for delineation will be used.
Territorial distribution will focus on economic value rather than on surface
area. Under this formula, Moslems could receive two units, the Bihac area
and the Sarajevo-Tuzla-Zenica triang1e. The industrial production capacity
of these represents a proportion of Bosnia's gross domestic product that is
greater than the Moslem proportion (44 per cent) of the population.
The Owen/Stoltenberg plan will accept the reality that Bosnia and
Herzegovina can exist only as a voluntary union of its three constituent
peoples. Calls for a multicultural and multinational Bosnia and Herzegovina
are lofty goals and should be the ultimate objective, but the reality of
Bosnia and Herzegovina is that its electorate chose to belong to purely
ethnic parties and to vote along ethnic lines - Croat, Moslem and Serb.
This reflects not so much a lack of commitment to democracy and the
tolerance of diversity as the deep-seated fear of government in a society
conditioned by a legacy of ethnic-based oppression. Four centuries of
domination by the Ottomans were followed by the post-first world war
dictatorship of the Serbian monarchy and then by the Serbian-dominated
communist Yugoolav government.
Ethnic dominance is a particular concern to Bosnian Croats, who are the
smallest of the three groups. This should concern Mr Izetbegovic as well.
One often overlooks the fact that, given the casualties in this war, it is
almost certain that the Serbs will emerge as the largest population group
and possibly a majority in Bosnia and Herzegovina after the war.
In a country where the largest ethnic group dominates, the challenge,
therefore, is to devise a political system that creates a credible balance
of power between the three peoples.
In some respects the Owen/Stoltenberg plan will resemble the first
constitutional arrangement of the US. Confederation was the foundation of a
democratic model of government widely considered the best in the world. The
Articles of Confederation of 1781 formed the nucleus of trust and
co-operation between the autonomous-minded 13 colonies which had differing
needs, interests and political aspirations. No other initial form of
government could overcome the mistrust in a centralised government's ability
to respect individual, group, religious and economic rights.
For those who insist that, no matter what it is called, this is the end of
Bosnia and Herzegovina, I say: you are absolutely wrong. This is the only
way that Bosnia and Herzegovina can survive - as an arrangement that allows
for balance of political power. Confederation is the way to prevent what
would become one-party rule in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
We must not build what could became an ethnic party dictatorship in Bosnia
and Herzegovina. We should look to build a genuine and sustainable democracy
instead. Confederation will do that. At the moment, just as in 1781, nothing
else can.

FT  22 JUL 93 / Leading Article: New leader for the EBRD
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE EUROPEAN Bank, as its departed president, Mr Jacques Attali, liked to
call the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, needs a new
start. It will soon get a new boss, but it also needs redefinition and
restructuring. Only then might it prove more than an expensive and
embarrassing failure.
Mr Attali's legacy is not all bad. The founding-president had two
achievements: the most important was to have been chief spokesman for the
needs of his clients; the second was to establish the institution. The next
president must build on both.
Ideally, that person would combine the qualities of two candidates, the
experience of the reforming ex-finance minister of Poland, Mr Leszek
Balcerowicz, and the knowledge of international financial institutions of
former International Monetary Fund managing director, Mr Jacques de
Larosiere. The winner could also use the development banking skills of the
World Bank's Ernest Stern and the political clout of former British prime
minister, Lady Thatcher. Such a paragon is unavailable. But the EBRD has to
get as close to that ideal as possible. Its new chief must at the least
possess knowledge of the economic task ahead, impeccable integrity and
political weight.
Selection of a man like Leszek Balcerowicz would have attractions. It would
symbolise the reunification of Europe; would put someone from eastern Europe
in an important pulpit; and would endow the EBRD with relevant experience at
its highest level. But there are questions. Does Mr Balcerowicz, for all his
achievements, have the political and managerial skills the job needs?
Equally, would anyone from a client state of the EBRD be able to command the
attention of western governments on contentious policy issues, such as
trade?
If it is to be someone from the donor countries, Mr de Larosiere looks the
most credible candidate yet to emerge. This is not because France has a
'moral claim' to a job that was won in an unsavoury horse trade with the
British and then filled by a man who has proved unsuitable. Nor is it
because there is a shortage of French officials in high places. With Michel
Camdessus at the IMF, Jacques Delors at the Commission of the European
Communities and Jean-Claude Paye at the OECD, France is more than adequately
represented. The case for Mr de Larosiere is that he has vast relevant
experience.
Choosing a new president will not be enough. The bank must itself be
restructured if it is to help restructure former communist countries. Since
Europe has no shortage of private merchant banks, the EBRD's existence
cannot be justified as a public sector one. More fundamentally, lending by
the EBRD directly to private projects is neither a necessary nor a
sufficient condition for development of healthy economies based on the
private sector. Existence of a public institution like the EBRD is justified
by its ability to contribute simultaneously to the formulation of policy,
development of institutions, financing of infrastructure and direct lending
to private projects. The bank should be organised not by types of projects,
but by countries, and possess a substantial permanent presence on the
ground.
The question facing the EBRD is not just who should lead it, but what it is
for. The new president should follow Mr Attali's example by speaking up for
the countries in transformation. But he (or she) must also lead an effective
development institution. The EBRD is not that now. Its new president must be
able to make it one.

FT  22 JUL 93 / Leading Article: UK aerospace
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK's House of Commons trade and industry committee has a hankering for
old-fashioned industrial policies. Earlier this year it called for a panoply
of controls and subsidies to shore up the coal industry. Yesterday it served
up a similar recipe for the aerospace sector: a five-fold increase to Pounds
100m a year in government subsidies; more generous aid to launch new
products; and possible additional hand-outs to help companies convert from
military to civilian products. All this, it said, was necessary to prevent
the industry suffering irreversible damage as a result of unfair competition
from heavily-subsidised overseas rivals.
Such talk is unduly alarmist. Though the industry is going through a
difficult patch following sensible cuts in military spending after the cold
war and the recession in civil aircraft, its underlying position in world
markets is strong. Rolls-Royce has built up a large share of the aero-engine
market, British Aerospace is a shareholder in Airbus, which has taken the
number two slot behind Boeing in civil aircraft manufacture, and the
industry continues to perform well in winning overseas military orders.
The committee's call for subsidies is ill-judged. This is not just because
hand-outs breed dependency, cost taxpayers money they can ill afford and
assume that the government is better at picking winning technologies than
the market ' a theory that has been disproved by bitter experience.
In this case, subsidies would be peculiarly counter-productive because they
could help trigger an international subsidy war which Britain would be
ill-placed to win. Although many governments aid their aerospace industries,
such hand-outs are kept in check by last year's agreement between the
European Community and the US. The Clinton administration has been itching
for an excuse to unpick the deal, following pressure from stricken US
manufacturers, and it would be unwise in the extreme to give him one.
Fortunately, the government is unlikely to go down the subsidy route, though
it will pick up the committee's ideas about better dialogue between
officials and industry. But this does not mean that government could not do
still more to enhance the industry's competitiveness. It should push for a
multilateral agreement which rolls back subsidies even further than last
year's deal and includes more countries within its remit. It should also
urge other European governments to abandon Airbus's quasi-political status
and convert it into a normal public company run on purely commercial lines.
Such action could be called an industrial policy, but it would be very
different from the committee's.

FT  22 JUL 93 / Letters To The Editor: Streamlining is enough for regulatory
system
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Sir GORDON DOWNEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Lex suggests ('Prudential regulation', July 12) that legislation is the
only way to improve the regulation of retail financial services. It is not.
The new Personal Investment Authority can deliver higher standards of retail
regulation and crack down on fraud and malpractice. It will set tough
measures of competence for the industry as a whole and introduce a single
system for the resolution of complaints.
I am not alone in arguing this approach. A growing number of institutions
and leading industry figures take the same view. Those who call for
statutory regulation are not all seeking the same solution. The fact is that
our present regulatory structure is statute-based but benefits from the full
participation of practitioners who understand the industry in which they
operate.
We have had more direct forms of supervision by government in the past, and
these were much criticised for their ineffectiveness. Do we really want to
go down a track which has failed investors so many times before?
Five years ago the government decided to institute a system of
self-regulation and this has undeniably delivered considerable benefits for
the protection of the investing public. What is now required is a
streamlining of the present system, which will build upon the achievements
of self-regulation, while rectifying its weaknesses.
I strongly urge consumer bodies and all parts of the industry to co-operate
with us in designing the Personal Investment Authority in a way which will
command widespread confidence.

FT  22 JUL 93 / Economic Viewpoint: Clues to rising unemployment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
By any standards the unemployment rate in western industrial countries is
alarming. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development expects
the total in its 24-member countries to reach nearly 36m in 1994 - some 19m
in the EC. On top of these are an estimated 3.7m people who have been
'discouraged' and 9.3m part-time workers who say they would prefer to work
full time.
The unemployment estimates are equivalent to an unemployment rate of 8 1/2
per cent for the whole of the OECD, but 11 1/2 -12 per cent for the EC. For
all President Bill Clinton's grumbling, the US has an unemployment rate of 7
per cent, expected to drop to 6 1/2 per cent with economic recovery; and in
sharp contrast to Europe's economy, unemployment has not been on a rising
long-term trend.
On equivalent definitions, the worst-hit countries are Spain and Ireland
with unemployment rates in excess of 20 per cent. Among the larger European
countries, both France and unified Germany are in the course of overtaking
the UK in the unemployment stakes: all three have rates not very far from
10-12 per cent. Sweden, once presented as a labour market model, now has an
unemployment rate of nearly 7 1/2 per cent. There is much the same effective
rate in Japan if allowance is made for the exceptionally high number of
Japanese discouraged workers and unrecorded jobless. The best performers are
still found in the Alpine states of Switzerland and Austria, with
unemployment rates of 4 1/2 -5 per cent - though still higher than a decade
ago.
Faced with this challenge, OECD economists say, in the italicised
introduction to a so-called editorial chapter of the July Employment
Outlook: 'To respond effectively, policy needs to exploit the
complementarity between sound macroeconomic policies, aimed at creating the
right environment for economic agents to take long-term decisions about
saving and investing, and structural policies aimed at making labour and
product markets more adaptable.'
Politicians of different countries and persuasions, both supporters and
opponents of the Social Chapter, seem happy to sign declarations embodying
this mind-numbing OECD-speak. But the unanimity is achieved at too high a
price.
The British chancellor, Kenneth Clarke, put it better in Frankfurt on
Monday, when he said that Europe's labour markets are 'over-rigid,
over-regulated and over-priced'. Regulations and high overheads to pay for
social security are just as much a cost to employers as excessive wages and
have a similar effect on jobs.
To say that economic growth will not cure hard-core unemployment is itself a
half truth. Clarke suggests that a European growth rate averaging 2-3 per
cent a year is required simply to halt - eventually - the rising
unemployment tide. In that case a higher growth rate is still required to
reduce unemployment - unless it is seriously thought that extra workers
would make a negative contribution.
There are still only two respectable diagnoses of high unemployment:
inadequate demand and pricing out of work. Almost for the first time since
the second world war, inadequate demand growth is an important force.
Whether because of the legacy of past tight monetary policies, or because of
the debt overhang, total cash spending - measured by Nominal gross national
product - in the Group of Seven countries has risen by only 3 1/2 per cent
in the past 12 months, compared to the 5 1/2 -6 per cent which would be
required to secure reasonably non-inflationary growth. Budget-balancing
exercises should be put on ice until demand growth is clearly recovering (as
it is in the UK).
The word 'structural' - or better hard-core - can legitimately be used for
that part of unemployment which would not be permanently reduced by demand
expansion. It is this element which has been rising, from one business cycle
to the next, and which is especially bad in Europe.
The proximate explanation for this hard core is pricing people out of work:
that is pay and other labour costs which make workers unprofitable to
employ. This is clearly related to the radical-right emphasis on dole rates
which discourage people from accepting low-paid employment. The two come
together in the probability that without the dole, pay rates would drop, as
people would have to price themselves into work to survive. I prefer the
pricing-out formulation because it leaves space for institutional and
psychological forces which - quite apart from the dole - stop pay shifting
to market-clearing levels.
Although mention of pricing out of work always leads to protests, hardly any
of the indignant responses put their finger on the real weaknesses of the
thesis, which is its timelessness. Why should pricing out of work have got
worse from the 1960s to the 1970s, from the 1970s to the 1980s, and the
1980s to the 1990s?
The OECD almost unwittingly provides a clue in a chapter dealing with
widening pay differentials among those who remain in work. These
differentials are measured in the chart by the ratio of the pay of those 10
per cent down from the top in the earnings distribution to those in the
middle ('the median'). It is also measured by the ratio of those in the
middle to those who are 90 per cent of the way down.
Almost every country has shown an increase in the ratio of top to median
earnings, especially among males. The estimates are of pay before tax and
social security contributions. In some countries, such as the US and UK, the
rise started in the late 1970s, but everywhere it became more acute in the
1980s. Michael Prowse explained on the facing page in yesterday's FT that in
the US there has been an absolute fall of more than 10 per cent in the
earnings of those at the bottom. In the UK there was also a widening of the
gap between the bottom 10 per cent and the median. The main exception to
these trends is Germany, which may explain some of the present difficulties
in the German labour market. Although this cannot yet be shown statistically
differentials have become not only larger but more unstable, especially in
the executive groups.
According to the OECD, very little of the increased earnings dispersion is
due to structural shifts such as the move from industry to services. For the
rise in dispersion has been very similar within each business sector. The
Employment Outlook does state, however, that technological change has raised
the productivity of highly skilled workers more than unskilled ones; and the
1980s saw a rise in the 'education differential'.
But even within groups of similar education and work experience, pay
differentials grew. In a daring dive into common sense the OECD writers
suggest 'an increased importance for skills not measured by educational
qualifications, such as the ability to work with other people' and also
payments more closely geared to performance.
The moral for unemployment suggests itself. If pay differentials had to
widen so much even with an ever-growing departure from full employment, how
much more would they have to widen to price all workers into jobs? It is not
just a question of all pay or average pay being too high, but of some pay
relative to others. The causal forces have come from changes in market
relativities.
As there are obvious resistances to relative pay moving to market-clearing
levels, both from the operation of the benefit floor and from other
frictions, the tensions showed themselves in higher unemployment. In the US,
and perhaps now in the UK too, tensions are showing themselves in bigger pay
differences and less secure jobs.
Unemployment, less stable employment and greater differentials are three
ways in which a more diversified and volatile labour market is making itself
felt. The third may be the least bad of the three choices.

FT  22 JUL 93 / Letters To The Editor: Few realise real cost of a pension
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr R W NEATE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Hugo Dixon unfortunately fails to appreciate that the cost of a decent
pension is not grasped by the majority ('The best judges', July 19). Hence
only a relatively small proportion of personal pension contracts take in
contributions other than the National Insurance rebates.
In Pilkington, top-ups were provided by the employer to those retiring in
1945-60 to ensure long-serving employees had pensions of up to 40 per cent
of final salary. Pensions generated by the base money purchase scheme
established in 1919 were not adequate, despite contributions more than
comparable with current NI rebates.
Under the current Pilkington approach to pensions, the employer contribution
is a defined percentage, but final salary type benefits are provided by the
trustees (50 per cent member-elected). If surpluses are generated, the
trustees decide the application; equally, if a deficit emerged, the trustees
would have to manage the situation, perhaps by cutting future accrual or
asking the members for more.
Lastly, on the question of linking pensions to a member's contributions we
also provide a scheme (like the State Earnings-Related Pension Scheme) in
which benefits are related to career long contributions, the contributions
being up-rated in line with an average earnings index. Again, it has 50 per
cent member trusteeship and a defined employer contribution.

BEYOND THE WALL: Germany's Road to Unification
By Elizabeth Pond
Brookings Institution Pounds 22.50 367 pages
Of the many wonderfully described events leading up to the collapse of the
Berlin Wall in Elizabeth Pond's book, there is one that is particularly
poignant. In early October 1989, when the people of Leipzig were beginning
to shake off their fear of the Stasi, or secret police, Kurt Masur, director
of the Gewanthaus Orchestra, and five other Leipzigers, drafted an appeal
for calm. The eloquent document was printed on smudged carbon copies and
read out to thousands gathering at the Nikolai Kirche, focal point of
growing opposition to the communist regime.
To make sure the message would get through, Masur recorded the statement and
had it broadcast by the local radio station. Afterwards, he returned to the
Gewandhaus to conduct that night's concert. It was as if it was entirely
natural for a classical conductor in his 60s to help shape a peaceful
revolution in one of the world's most highly militarised countries in the
late 1980s.
Yet, as Pond shows, the revolution could have ended in bloodshed and death.
The Stasi and East German police were heavily armed. The authorities,
expecting violence, had ordered blood supplies to be flown to hospitals in
Leipzig. But nothing happened. The Stasi held back. Their orders from Berlin
were confused. And, once the people had found their voice and courage, the
leadership crumbled.
There are many reasons why East Germany's communists caved in so easily.
Pond argues that the communists were out of touch not only with the rapidly
changing mood in the country but also with events in the rest of eastern
Europe. They thought they could buy time by merely tinkering at reform. But
communist leaderships were falling one by one elsewhere. Had Erich Honecker,
or his inebriated successor, Egon Krenz, used force, East Germans would
simply have voted with their feet by leaving the country through Hungary.
Indeed, once Hungary refused to send back the thousands who had sought
refuge through the summer of 1989, they realised they had found a way around
the wall. It was the beginning of the end of the party's omnipotence.
The collapse of the wall would not have been possible, however, without
Mikhail Gorbachev. Here Pond is at her best. Gorbachev had to be careful not
to rush German unification for fear of alienating hardliners in Moscow.
Bonn, Washington and London worked hard to preserve his fragile power base
through judicious statements reassuring the then-Soviet Union about Nato's
role in a united Germany. This gave them a chance to work out the mechanics
of unification.
Pond, who has relied on German and US sources, rather than British or
French, shows that the US state department believed early on unification was
inevitable. It realised, however, that unification was moving much faster
than Britain wanted. Indeed, Margaret (now Lady) Thatcher was more than
sceptical about the merits of a united Germany, fearing a bigger Germany
would upset the balance of power in the European Community and Europe
generally. Yet, once unification was sealed, Helmut Kohl, basking as first
chancellor of the new united Germany, shifted his attention to anchoring
Germany into Europe and made the realisation of the Maastricht treaty a
priority.
In retrospect, perhaps Kohl has devoted attention to Europe which could have
been better spent helping foster understanding between the two halves of
Germany. Pond's book, too, might have given more attention to the internal
dynamics of German unification and looked forward to how it might work
itself out.
On many levels, Germany continues to experience a revolution. Unlike the
countries of eastern Europe, which are making a slow transition to the
market economy and democratic institutions, eastern Germany is being
completely transformed. Its entire economic, social and political base has
been uprooted and replaced by western German institutions. Judges, school
teachers, diplomats, factory managers and professors have been sacked or
replaced.
The result has been debilitating in one important respect: eastern Germany
has not yet produced local political elites. No wonder the easterners
complain about colonisation by the westerners, who in turn resent how deeply
they are digging into their pockets to pay for unification.
There have also been profound effects on economic and foreign policy. The
high cost of modernising eastern Germany means Bonn is slowly reconsidering
the consensus-based corporate capitalism which shaped Germany's postwar
development in favour of more competition. East Germany itself is too small
a market to force this change. Yet the way in which the east Germans -
backed by the Treuhand, the agency overseeing privatisation, and the finance
ministry - are beginning to demand greater access for foreign investors,
particularly in the energy and electricity sectors, shows they are not
prepared to accept monopolies being imposed on them.
Unification has also meant that Bonn is having to decide the role it is
prepared to play in international organisations, particularly in the United
Nations. This has meant much soul-searching - predictable, according to Pond
 -about the tasks Bonn, Washington and the EC should perform in the
post-cold war era.
But this quest, contrary to Mrs Thatcher's grim predictions, has not created
a pushy Germany. If anything, unification has exposed Europe's, and
Germany's, limitations in dealing with the consequences of the collapse of
communism, as the Balkans confirm.
As for Kurt Masur, unification has allowed him to bask in his own new-found
freedom by conducting in New York.

FT  22 JUL 93 / Letters To The Editor: Defence budgets should fund
peacekeeping
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Professor RONALD DORE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In all the recent discussion of the restructuring of the United Nations
 -including Edward Mortimer's perceptive piece 'Limits of world order' (July
21) - one constant theme is the shoestring financing of peacekeeping
operations.
But I see no mention of one particular and important item in the proposals
of Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary-general, of last July - his Agenda
for Peace document. It was a simple one; would member states please shift
their funds for UN peacekeeping from their foreign office to their defence
ministry budget. It is, after all, rational functional budgeting. The UN and
national forces are alternative means to the end of national security.
It makes sense in other ways. Defence budgets are universally bigger.
Defence chiefs get committed at the budgeting stage to operations which they
might be called on to carry out. And the chances will be increased of
shifting from contingency to regular financing, thereby making possible the
creation of permanent UN command structures which can prevent the sort of
muddled mismanagement - and waste of resources and lives - that has vitiated
the Somalia operation.

FT  22 JUL 93 / Letters To The Editor: Hopes of more road schemes being
abandoned
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ASHLEY D DEACON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Mr John Stewart, chairman of the Alliance Against Road-building
(Letters, July 14), is quite right: there is indeed a growing movement
calling for a shift in emphasis by the Department of Transport away from
road-building and a rethinking of the government's multi-billion pound roads
programme.
The Oxleas Wood decision has not only given that movement added momentum, it
has also encouraged those currently challenging DoT road-building proposals
at public inquiries. Speaking from personal experience, coming as it did in
the middle of a lengthy and gruelling cross-examination by counsel for the
DoT at the A36 Salisbury by-pass inquiry, the Oxleas Wood decision was an
enormous morale booster.
In the 'little man's' battle against the DoT's big guns, the Oxleas Wood
decision was only the latest in what, it is to be hoped, will be a
lengthening list of abandoned road schemes from a government that listens to
public opinion, recognises the financial constraints it faces, and is
politically astute enough to modify its policies accordingly.

FT  22 JUL 93 / Letters To The Editor: Employee-shareholder control of wage
inflation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PETER INGRAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Ivan Cohen (Letters, July 13) takes issue with my suggestion that
institutional shareholders might be able to exert a beneficial influence on
wage bargaining on the grounds that these shareholdings are owned by the
employees affected. To criticise the proposal on these grounds is to miss
the point. Employees are too frequently the stake-holder in the company most
adversely affected by wage inflation. If employees, via their pension funds,
can exert a cost discipline that avoids inflationary wage outcomes, current
costly solutions such as high unemployment might be better avoided.
Mr Cohen is mistaking a desire to avoid inflationary wage growth for a
proposal to 'check wages'. The two are not the same thing. It is affordable
real wage growth that employees require and if employees, through their
shareholdings, can assist this process, while avoiding the distortion of
inflation and the existing remedy of unemployment, then it can only be to
their benefit as well as to that of the corporate sector as a whole.

FT  22 JUL 93 / Arts: Funding threat to Lieder contest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On Tuesday, in the Old Library of the City of London Guildhall, the Walter
Gruner Lieder Competition completed its sixth finale. This event, a biennial
feature of the annual City of London Festival, is the world's only musical
competition of any importance devoted to Lieder - the point was underlined
by the distinguished baritone Benjamin Luxon, the Gruner jury chairman, in a
pre-results-giving address.
It perhaps needs underlining the more because, as Luxon also made clear,
there seems to have arisen a question-mark over the competition's future
survival. A bequest left by Gruner (an admired Lieder pedagogue at the
Guildhall School) after his death in 1980 has been up to now the source of
funding (together with sponsorship from the festival itself). The Gruner
cash has now run out. Unless an alternative source can be found, the sixth
edition is in all likelihood the last.
This matters. Though in principle competitions are a wasteful way of
spotlighting the world's new and important musical talents, the Gruner
offers only a relatively small first prize (Pounds 5,000 plus a Wigmore Hall
recital); its spotlight is therefore not injuriously bright, and the
seriousness with which it has always been undertaken makes the competition
less of a strain on those young talents than many of similar stature. As
Luxon also suggested, in a world in which opera is currently the musical
'market leader', the value of an event in which the less showy artistic uses
of the singing voice are insisted upon grows ever greater.
A competition that began with Olaf Baer as its first winner, and that has
had Simon Keenlyside, Anna Steiger, Thomas Lander and Ruth Ziesak among
subsequent alumni at various levels, has surely justified its usefulness.
This year the first prize was withheld (as it was two years ago) - always a
let-down, but to my mind an entirely justifiable decision.
The de facto champion, the German tenor Christian Elsner, took second prize;
he was rumoured to have sung his final round suffering a heavy cold, but
clean, fresh tone, musical sensitivity and expressive blandness - hardly a
phrase explored for any dramatic implication - are features of his
performance that are probably preserved even when the voice is healthier.
The other finalists, the Canadian bass-baritone Nathan Berg and the Dutch
baritone Geert Smits, shared fourth prize (the third was also withheld);
this seemed rather a snub to Berg's lively, pinpoint powers of
communication, but at the same time an eminently arguable response to the
not-quite-finished vocal techniques of both young men.
So, a rather disappointing conclusion to a competition that is itself at the
crossroads. But that is no reason to hope for anything other than its
continued existence.

FT  22 JUL 93 / Arts: A dark Orlando - Aix Festival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The festival at Aix-en-Provence has a distinguished history, which it
preserves proudly. A videotheque, set up by the town, holds an archive of
opera productions back to 1959, which is available to the public, every
individual aria instantly accessible, free, in well-appointed video viewing
rooms - surely a unique resource.
A glance through the catalogue suggests that Aix has traditionally put the
emphasis on singers. Audiences here are always ready to applaud good
singing, while they reserve a peculiarly French cacophony of boos, catcalls
and whistles for producers and conductors to whom they have taken a dislike.
But there can be justice in their verdicts: none of this year's three
productions drew as much strength from its subject as it might.
The most successful was Orlando, produced by Robert Carsen. For a producer
this opera must be either a dream or a nightmare. In one of his most daring
scores Handel ran together a wildly heterogeneous succession of moods -
light comedy, magic, lavish theatrical effects, romance and black tragedy,
all derived from the story of poor Orlando, whose obsessive love drives him
headlong into madness.
It was this last aspect which interested Carsen. Faced with the familiar
problem of how to deliver Handelian opera to a present-day audience, he
determined to confront the opera's dark side. No magic power was allowed any
influence over events; the characters were driven by their own psychological
demons.
What was asked of Felicity Palmer was a portrayal of the title-role
emotionally so frank as to make one want to avert one's eyes. Full-frontal
anguish, naked pain were put before us. As a sheer outpouring of feeling it
was enormously impressive, as exhausting for us as it must have been for
her, but it was achieved at a price: the vocal performance became a
relentless onslaught of raw chest notes, tipping over into wild exaggeration
in the celebrated mad scene. Surely the early part of the role might have
been played a little more easily?
For light relief there were scenes of mundane everyday life. As the
shepherdess Dorinda, Rosa Mannion washed her smalls in the brook and ironed
them in the kitchen later, all the while singing with delectable
spontaneity. Her long second-act aria was the evening's winner. Rosemary
Joshua sang with some beauty of tone as Angelica, deserving of a more
interesting princely consort than Jennifer Lane's Medoro. Harry van der Kamp
as the sorcerer Zoroastro, reduced to a businessman in a shabby raincoat,
was left without his magic powers or much charisma.
Ultimately there was no place for sorcery in a production which wanted human
weakness to shoulder responsibility for human actions. The wonders, both
magical and scenic, in Orlando were missing. Too many cliches, too. (The
naked girl extra must have felt chilly as the night closed in - the
performance did not end until after 1am.) But Antony McDonald's simple,
trendy sets looked good and nothing that Carsen did distorted the
characters.
As so often, a late 20th-century production style was teamed with carefully
considered 18th-century musical practice. For Handel (though not Mozart) Aix
prefers period instruments these days. William Christie directed his group
Les Arts Florissants with a light touch. Altogether, a performance not
without interest for the archives.
Aix-en-Provence festival continues until July 28.

FT  22 JUL 93 / Arts: From Twin Peaks to a trough of tedium - Cinema
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STORYVILLE (15)
Mark Frost
TANGO (15)
Patrice Laconte
BAMBI (U)
Walt Disney
As one of the principal writers of Twin Peaks and Hill Street Blues, Mark
Frost was responsible for some of the more daring and accomplished work to
hit the small screen in recent years. It is therefore a surprise and a
disappointment that his movie debut, Storyville, should be an anaemic
formula thriller, lacking the dramatic drive and quirky detail of his
previous work.
Set in and about New Orleans, Storyville concerns itself with Cray Fowler, a
young lawyer from a wealthy Louisiana dynasty who is running for Congress.
His ill-considered tryst with sexy karate instructor Lee (Charlotte Lewis)
lands him in big trouble when her pimp father is murdered after secretly
filming them making steam in a jacuzzi. Lee is accused of the crime and Cray
decides to defend her, in the process uncovering some disturbing facts about
his own father's death. Murder, mayhem and scandal ensue, resulting in a
courtroom scene that ends in a slow motion gunfight (including the judge)
just as the plot teeters on the edge of pure confusion.
Storyville starts out looking like a hot-blooded Southern political
thriller, thought it soon loses its way, branching out to include racial
politics, murky family relations, Vietnam atrocities, oil scandals, even
transvestitism. Frost as director proves to be competent if a bit slow,
though as a writer he seems not to understand that a 100-minute movie
requires more discipline than a television series. Every time the movie
threatens to become comprehensible Frost switches tracks. There are so many
loose ends here that it winds up resembling a ball of yarn after being
discovered by a kitten. After a while you feel that there is really no
reason to pay attention.
As for the cast, some turn in stridently hammy performances, such as Jason
Robards as a drunken family patriarch and Piper Laurie, who behaves as if
she had just wandered in from a Tennessee Williams play. Others, like Spader
and Joanna Whalley-Kilmer as a tough lawyer, merely look stricken. The
film's only bright spot is the presence of Michael Warren and Charles Haid,
the duo who played Hill and Renko on Hill Street Blues. Haid is robustly
vulgar as a pornographer, while Warren, balding gracefully, sums up
proceedings best of all when he proclaims that 'there's a mighty big turd in
the punch bowl.'
If Frost's film wanders off down too many thematic avenues, then Patrice
Leconte's Tango suffers from the opposite fate. Early on, it promises to be
a fulsome black comedy examining that dark part of every married man's
psyche that wishes for his wife to be out of the picture - permanently. But
after sounding this intriguing and potentially resonant note, Leconte bangs
away at it until it rings hollow.
The film deals with Paul (Thierry Lhermitte), a philandering husband whose
wife turns the tables on him when she finds out about his cheating. She has
a very public affair, then leaves him. At first he thinks her absence is a
blessing, but he soon discovers that he cannot be happy as long as he knows
that she is off betraying him somewhere.
He asks the advice of his confirmed bachelor uncle (Philippe Noiret), who
suggests that Paul should kill her, reasoning that a being a widower is a
lot less taxing on the mind than being divorced. They hire Vincent (Richard
Bohringer) to do the job, who several years earlier had killed his own wife
when he discovered her infidelity. The three set off on a search for their
prey that will eventually lead them to Africa, where Paul's wife is working
for a medical charity.
Leconte's previous films, especially Monsieur Hire and The Hairdresser's
Husband, were exquisite blends of Gallic whimsy and real feeling that were
able to catch the viewer off-guard without ever alienating him. And for its
first half-hour Tango promises to do the same, captivating us with a brand
of dark comedy that manages to be charming in spite of its seemingly
unpleasant subject matter. The best scenes are the opening ones, in which
Vincent, a skywriter, is cuckolded by a wife who watches him paint the sky
while she is with her lover. Vincent suspects something is up and tries to
spy on her, but she realises that he is nearby upon seeing that the
skywriting is not his.
However, such wonderfully inventive moments cannot sustain what is a rather
flimsy film. By the midway point Leconte seems to run out of ideas and
starts repeating himself. The film loses its freshness, it stops surprising
us and descends into a sort of manic predictability that leaves the viewer
cold. There is a pointless fight with a truck driver, a senseless sequence
of aerial acrobatics with two teenage girls. Even a cameo by Carole Bouquet
seems artificial, her cool beauty serving as an illustration to the
director's thematic agenda rather than an alluring summons into the heart of
the film. With Tango, the music stops long before the dancing is over.
*****
I wonder, if Bambi were made today and given a Royal Premiere, which member
of the gun-toting, blood-sporting Windsors would dare show their face and
thereby risk being set upon by an audience of children hungry for revenge?
Actually, they need not worry - by today's standards of cartoon carnage,
Bambi's off-screen violence will probably fail to raise many young eyebrows,
whereas 50 years ago it sent kids and parents alike blubbing from the
theatre.
Although it remains far better than most things for children, it must be
admitted that Bambi is not always up to Disney's high standards, somehow
just missing that blend of humour, sentimentality and menace that made other
Disney animated films so great. And I wonder how many parents are up to
explaining to their five-year-olds what all those couples of rabbits and
skunks were hurrying off to do during the spring sequence? Still, anyone who
has to read a review to decide whether or not to see Bambi either has no
kids or does not pay any attention to them.

FT  22 JUL 93 / Arts: Daphne's secret love - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Daphne and Gertie] Even if you have not read the recent biography of Daphne
du Maurier, you may well have heard that its hottest revelation is the
passionate friendship that at one time developed between du Maurier and
Gertrude Lawrence. (What a shock] Those of us who were born after Lawrence's
death had never even thought of linking their names. Du Maurier was not,
after all, a character in Star, the naff Lawrence bio-pic of my youth.) Here
is the play that brought the two women together. Du Maurier wrote it, as a
response to another love-affair, in a fortnight in 1948; Lawrence was the
actress selected to play the leading role. It ran at the Aldwych for 15
months; Lawrence - who died in 1951 - never again acted on the London stage;
du Maurier wrote no other play.
Now September Tide returns to London for the first time in 43 years. A
romance with a difference, its action occurs in 1948. Stella Martyn, a
widow, is visited in Cornwall by her daughter Cherry and her new son-in-law,
Evan Davies, a talented painter. Stella, a romantic woman and loyal mother,
is possessed by old-style values ('Thank Heaven I had Puritan parents who
brought me up with a pre-1914 mentality'), whereas both Cherry and Evan are
somewhat Bohemian. She believes in marriage based on love, while they are so
modern as to sleep in separate rooms. (Daughter to mother: 'Your generation
thinks of nothing but sex.') But Evan falls seriously in love with his
mother-in-law, and Stella discovers reluctantly that she feels the same way
about him. What happens after that (ie all Act Two) I shall not disclose
here.
Though I can imagine this forming the basis for a good movie, as has so much
of du Maurier's fiction, September Tide steers too close too often to
dramatic cliche. 'What are you trying to tell me?' 'Everything. Nothing. All
I know is the world has become a different place.' A storm arrives with such
convenient timing that Cherry has to spend a night away from home. Everyone
keeps up the romantic-novel view of Cornwall as a place where men are men
and women have the wind in their hair.
But the cliches it sets up: Stella makes the kind of entrance that great
actresses used to love, with a basket full of roses, but promptly knocks
over Evan's painting box. And in general the text has more wit, and a
stronger period sense, than the current cast reveals.
Susannah York, for all her loveliness and bloom, never looks like a woman
who harks back to pre-1930 music or manners, and she makes Stella so
sensible and ordinary that she irons over the role's dry and debonair
humour. (On hearing from Evan that Cherry is a mediocre painter: 'What a
blessing she did not go in for singing. Such an expensive training. The art
school was comparatively cheap.') Moment by moment, York makes sense of the
role; but as a whole her Stella is so middle-of-the-road that she knocks the
wind out of this story's sails.
Brendan Coyle has the right brooding intensity for the role of Evan. As
Cherry, however, Francesca Hunt overdoes the bright eyes and teeth; and
overdoes the upper-middle-class combination of hearty manners and pinched
little voice. None of the other roles is remotely three-dimensional in
conception or performance.

FT  22 JUL 93 / Arts: The Savoy rises from the ashes - Ballet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
London's Savoy Theatre re-opened on Monday, entirely rebuilt after the
terrible fire that gutted it in February 1990. It is good to report that
Basil Ionides' charming Art Deco interior has been scrupulously recreated:
the silvery auditorium, the carpets and painted ceilings, the period
ironwork and lighting, are all there, spankingly fresh and as stylish as
ever. (Only one regret: the theatre curtain is still hideous).
The Savoy has in its time housed dancing, albeit the stage is too small for
anything ambitious in scale. Its most celebrated occupant was George
Balanchine's dazzling but ephemeral troupe, Les Ballets 1933, whose brief
season was backed by Edward James as a gift to his wife, the Viennese dancer
Tilly Losch. Now the honour falls to English National Ballet to christen its
new stage this week with two triple bills.
The opening programme had as its centre-piece Olga Roriz' Seven Silences of
Salome, over-sibilant as to title, but tough as to dance content. (I
reported on its creation earlier this year). It features seven men who are
got up in a rag-bag of women's attire over trousers, and who behave as if in
the throes of delirium tremens. There is an obscurely argumentative
programme note, and the suggestion that what Roriz is giving us is a ragout
of Chippendales with more than a dash of feminist exegesis.
In the event, Silences triumphs over its ingredients, thanks to Roriz'
ability to make taut, anxious dance and to the splendid performances of the
men, among whom Denzil Bailey's rhythmic versatility, Thomas Edur's pure
style and Stephen Sherriff's psychic concentration, are outstanding. It is a
strong work, excellently suited to this stage, and it reveals a great deal
about the sure talents of the dancers involved.
Nothing in the rest of the programme made any comparable effect. Frederick
Franklin's Raymonda Grand Pas is the statutory classical divertissement,
with Petipa's dances cleverly adapted, but it demands truly grand dancing.
Among the soloists, Agnes Oaks and Irena Pasaric looked happy in their
pretty variations: these solos are jewels that they wore with the right
assurance. The rest was as subdued as the dreary powdered shoes worn by the
women: dancers ought to realise that the fashion for marshmallow shoes is
hugely unflattering to their feet. Light reflected from satin gives shape
and clarity to the foot, and to movement.
Wayne Sleep provided a romp to close the programme. This is Savoy Suite,
which makes jokes about Gilbert and Sullivan - whose music is given in a
brash arrangement - and marks the re-opening of the theatre with a great
deal of energetic activity. On these terms it is merry enough as an
occasional piece, and it ends with a resourceful dance for gondoliers (of
course). But its life-expectancy is not great.
English National Ballet is at the Savoy Theatre until 24 July. Programme
varies.

FT  22 JUL 93 / Technology: On the road to a slicker operation - The Peugeot
plant in Coventry has adopted leaner manufacturing, standardisation and a
just-in-time philosophy / Software at work
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLAIRE GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The assembly line at Peugeot's Ryton plant in Coventry stops and a group of
men and women converge on one car. There is an urgent, almost wordless, team
effort, with people pulling, prodding and drilling at parts of the car, an
embryonic Peugeot 405, before they rush back to their production jobs along
the line. The delay while the problem is fixed in just 10 seconds. Then the
line restarts and the vehicle's individual build-chart receives a tick and a
comment.
'Quality is something you build in; it can't be inspected into a vehicle'
says Colin Poynton, materials handling manager at Ryton. Two hours
previously, the car did not exist. In another 10 hours, it will roll off the
assembly line, ready to drive away. The people around the assembly line
appear to be performing a precise, high-pressure formation dance, in an
endless race with the slow-moving line. The plant produces right and
left-hand drive 306 and 405 family models for the UK, New Zealand, Cyprus
and parts of Africa and left-hand drive vehicles for most of Europe.
The process of building a new car has come a long way since Henry Ford
decreed 'any colour so long as it's black'. Customers hold the whip hand on
choice of specification and colour. Each car that comes off the line has
been specified, with dozens of choices already made, down to the colour of
the seats, trim and even the fascia. More than 57 per cent of the cars'
contents originate in the UK.
Computerisation was introduced to the Ryton plant in 1985. It had to come to
grips with the immense changes brought about by 'lean manufacturing', but
now has a smooth kanban operation - a Japanese-derived form of stock control
 -in which parts are replenished within five, and sometimes only two hours.
'We're continually aiming to reduce the stock we hold,' explains Poynton. He
recalls when the cavernous factory was filled almost to the roof with
racking for components and the metal 'stillage' trays used for large
sub-assembled parts. Now, the stacks carry only the parts used for the cars
within view and fork lift trucks pass constantly up the empty aisles
replenishing the queues, carrying parts that have been assembled and
delivered in a couple of hours.
'There was a time when everybody wanted to build up stocks, and make time
for themselves. There is a different attitude now. What we want is a
consistent work rate, keeping the stock level right. Now it's second nature,
but only as a benefit of re-education,' says Poynton. The slick operation
puts high demands on suppliers to Peugeot Talbot, the UK operation of the
French group. In common with many manufacturers, Peugeot is developing
'partnership' deals, aiming for one supplier per part. The suppliers for its
8,300 components have been reduced from 600 to 380. In the case of the
fascias, the supplier, Hills Precision Components, is nearby, but most
communications are done through electronic data interchange (EDI). Poynton
gives as an example the eight cars being built for New Zealand.
'Until we have the first four on the line here, we won't even pass the order
for the fascias and seats to the supplier for the next four.' Twelve times a
day, faxes arrive on the HPC shop floor, specifying fascia assemblies for
delivery to Ryton. There is a precise requirement for each one, including
left or right-hand drive and four colours. The company assembles them from
its stock, and delivers the completed components within two hours. Seats,
door casings and steering wheels are on continuous order, in a constant flow
for individual cars. Part of the job was creating single supplier
relationships, along the same lines as Peugeot Talbot.
This meant reducing the supplier base to 250 reliable 'partners' for the
3,000 or so different components. Even when the system of Bill McGilvray,
the supply manager, had halved the inventory, he estimated that around
Pounds 550,000 worth was 'still floating around in the manufacturing
process'. This is another classic manufacturing conundrum, as people tend to
squirrel away their own supplies - a 'just in case' mentality that
undermines 'just-in-time' methodology. 'It was difficult to get across who
owned that material. People always think there's something else on the way,
but it doesn't work like that.'
Peugeot Talbot is a part-owner of HPC, and its largest customer, but by no
means its only one. From 1987 onwards, HPC's customer base expanded to
include Jaguar Cars, Rover and Honda. Its product range, once limited to
soft trim and plastic moulding, was extended to include the entire seat,
steering wheels and fascias. With a 20-fold increase in turnover between
1983 and 1993, it became clear that new systems were needed to accommodate
the variety of work and customers.
Two years ago, HPC decided to invest in a broader-based manufacturing system
that would support all aspects of the cycle. The decision came at a time
when an associated company in HPC's parent group was reviewing and
standardising software systems. HPC decided to tap into central expertise,
and took a version of the Data 3 package from its French parent. A steering
committee, and a constant updating of skills eased the introduction of the
new system at HPC. Nevertheless, the implementation was not without hiccups,
mainly because of problems with customisation and associated training
requirements.
In 1991, HPC was falling so far behind schedule that it decided to take the
French version of the system from its parent. This is used throughout France
and Europe, with new releases verified centrally before implementation. This
results in group-wide standardisation, well worth the effort of using
screens in French according to McGilvray. The Data 3 software now provides
full control over in-process stocks, enabling HPC to pass some of the
just-in-time philosophy on to its own suppliers.
McGilvray has been able to introduce some local flexibility. For instance,
he buys foam from an English supplier and uses a local transport company to
provide a buffer by storing the foam, a sort of halfway house which saves on
space at the HPC site.
'Data 3 has focused us on how we look at the business in a structured way.
The mentality has changed. At the monthly meetings on sales and operations
planning, we now look at what's happened, and at the next four months and
its implications, something we could not have done before.'
Both Poynton at Peugeot Talbot, and McGilvray at HPC, have had to give up
individual systems that have served them well, in the cause of
standardisation. McGilvray misses his trusty Adds Mentor receiving system
which in some areas provided more tailored functions than Data 3. But both
managers were enthusiastic about the benefits of standardisation and
improvement of communication throughout the Peugeot group.
'More resources going into standardisation means more ideas' says Poynton.
'We now have the benefit of people throughout Europe feeding good ideas into
the system and thinking of ways to improve it.'
BUZZWORDS
LEAN MANUFACTURING (originated at Toyota), refers to the production of a
varied product with fewer people, less space, and a smaller inventory,
underpinned by flexible MRP II (Management Resources Planning) software.
This also means multi-skilled teams and flexible mechanisation, catering for
volume and variety.
JUST-IN-TIME (JIT) systems, refers to the process where each component is
flagged by a card (kanban). When the rack, bin, or container is empty, the
return of the card down the line to the shop floor indicates the need to
replenish the bin. At Peugeot Talbot the kanban is an electronic barcode and
messages are sent electronically.

growth

<TEXT>
GLOBAL advertising expenditure is not experiencing the kind of upturn that
has been predicted by some pundits at the start of 1993, but in the UK at
least there are indications that the worst of the recession may be over.
The media buying and planning company Zenith - part of the Saatchi and
Saatchi group - forecasts international real growth of 0.5 per cent this
year, compared with real growth of 0.2 per cent for 1992.
In its latest advertising expenditure review of 38 international markets,*
Zenith offers a patchy outlook for advertising spend in Europe's seven
biggest markets, which account for 93 per cent of the European Community's
consumers.
In real terms, spending on all forms of advertising in 1993 is forecast to
grow by 0.5 per cent in Belgium; to shrink by 5.8 per cent in France; to
increase by 1.7 per cent in Germany; to rise by 1.1 per cent in Italy; to
drop by 1.1 per cent in the Netherlands; and to decline by 2 per cent in
Spain.
There are predictions that the market will increase by 1.9 per cent in the
UK.
Nor is the North American market predicted to come surging out of the
recession, with real increases of less than 1 per cent a year forecast for
the current and also the next two years. For significant improvements, Asia
and the Pacific areas are still in advance of other regions.
The report forecasts real growth of 1.5 per cent in 1993, 3.6 per cent in
1994 and 4.4 per cent in 1995, which is more than double the international
average forecast for each year.

FT  22 JUL 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Pink Lady regains
her fizz - The growing market for ads aimed at Hispanic and black audiences
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two years ago Gaymer Group brands director Gary Holloway had a problem: how
to revive Pink Lady, a sparkling perry drink whose sales were looking
distinctly flat.
Advertising and promotion campaigns by some of the leading agencies in the
UK had failed to stem the decline and the demise of the 30-year-old brand
seemed only a matter of time.
It was then that research carried out for the company identified strong
demand for Pink Lady in areas of London with a large black population. The
idea of targeting this group of drinkers was born, the specialist agency
WM&amp;P was hired and the task of putting the fizz back into Pink Lady had
begun.
Advertising agencies which focus on Britain's ethnic minorities are not only
relatively new - WM&amp;P was formed in 1989 - they have provoked considerable
controversy within the industry.
Notwithstanding some notable and apparently successful campaigns - such as
Pink Lady - doubts remain about the viability of reaching an audience that
represents 5.5 per cent of the British population and is highly fragmented.
Others question the social consequences.
WM&amp;P's founders - former Collets Dickenson &amp; Pearce executive Werbayne
McIntyre and Pauline Robinson, who worked in PR promotion in the UK record
industry - insist that a black agency can perform an important role. Besides
Gaymer, its accounts have included HP Bulmer, Southwark Council, food
company Vee Tee Rice the Metropolitan Police (for whom it conducted a
recruitment campaign).
'We have the specialist knowledge of how to communicate with the different
ethnic minorities in Britain, not necessarily because we are black but
because we have an empathy for the things we are dealing with,' says
McIntyre.
For Pink Lady WM&amp;P decided on a two-pronged approach when it won the account
in 1991. The 'above-the-line' campaign was aimed at the wider market and was
centred on posters, the latest of which hit the streets in May in
multi-racial boroughs of London showing 'cool, fun-loving party people'. It
was backed up by advertising on radio stations.
The 'below-the-line' campaign was targeted at the core audience of black
people through promotions and sponsorship at night clubs, carnivals and
black beauty exhibitions.
Having halted the decline in the first year of the campaign, UK sales this
year are up 5 per cent on a year ago, and up 8 per cent in London. Holloway
is even thinking about using the same approach to promote some of the
company's other brands.
Another agency - Media Reach, formed in 1986 - targets the UK's 1.4m Asians
who speak Urdu, Bengali, Gujarati, Punjabi and Hindi. Its biggest client to
date has been the Central Office of Information (COI) for which it ran 14
radio and newspaper campaigns in the various Asian languages last year.
'Our advantage is that we can communicate with consumers in a language and
culture they understand,' says Javed Hussain, accounts and media director at
Media Reach. 'After all, many products and themes are not common to us.'
Despite its use of Media Reach, recent COI research suggests that the case
for always using a different kind of agency remains unproven. The research
showed that English-speaking ethnic minorities are as likely to read a
general newspaper as one specifically targeted at them.
'What really matters to us is getting the message over in the most
cost-effective way,' adds the COI.
That is just one of the problems. As John Tylee, associate editor of
Campaign, the industry magazine, points out: 'There is only a limited amount
of work for a black agency in the UK. The market is heavily fragmented and
thus not easy to reach. It is perhaps mainly useful only for those products
that gear themselves to a specific market such as cosmetic products.' He
thinks an agency specifically geared to the ethnic minorities will find it
hard to make money in the UK.
John Hegarty, creative director and chairman of Bartle Bogle Hegarty, one of
the leading UK advertising agencies, is more hostile. 'There is a case for
an agency that talks to, say, women or certain age groups, but an agency
identified by race is a dangerous concept. It is a divisive force in our
society and such examples as exist in the US show the failure of that
society. I just hope it does not happen here.'
That may be wishful thinking. Vince Cullers of Chicago, the US's oldest
black advertising agency, started in 1956, says it is looking at the UK as a
base for its agency, not only to service the Caribbean and Africa, but also
the rest of the European Community.

FT  22 JUL 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Complementing the
mainstream - The growing market for ads aimed at Hispanic and black
audiences
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One of the latest and most effective US television advertisements from Avon,
the US cosmetic company, portrays a child gently touching the face of its
mother, associating a new skin-care product with youth, family and purity.
The advertisement was memorable for Avon because it was produced in Spanish,
shown on the two US Spanish-language networks and was culturally tailored to
the child-loving Hispanic audience. Soon after being aired, the product
'Anew' became the number one skin lotion for US Hispanics.
Similar successes in Hispanic marketing can now be found throughout
corporate America, as big companies wake up to the implications of a rapidly
growing Hispanic market of some 24m consumers. Last year Hispanics spent an
estimated Dollars 221bn (Pounds 147bn) - about 5 per cent of the US total.
Coca-Cola, which in common with Avon has a dedicated Hispanic marketing
department, recalls that five years ago it made just five creative Hispanic
television and three radio spots in the year. Now it makes 20 Hispanic
television spots a year, and 10-12 radio ads, and enjoys a commanding lead
in the soft-drinks market for Hispanics.
While companies such as Coca-Cola also target advertising at other
minorities, such as blacks or Asian-Americans, this complements rather than
substitutes mainstream advertising. Such minorities do not have their own
language or television network, making it harder to target them as a group.
Most Hispanics, by contrast, do not fully understand English, prefer when
possible Spanish to mainstream Anglo television, and rarely read
English-language newspapers and magazines. That leaves big companies, keen
to capture Hispanic market share, little choice but to air Spanish-language
ads.
The result has been something of a boom in Spanish-language advertising,
with scores of Hispanic advertising companies setting up in the past decade
to cash in on the growth. In 1991, Hispanic agencies billed Dollars 733.5m,
up from Dollars 350.1m in 1988, according to Hispanic Business, a
California-based magazine.
Riding the crest of the wave are the two Spanish-language networks,
Univision and Telemundo. While over-burdened by debt, their revenues have
increased by an average 20 per cent a year since 1987. Joaquin Blaya, who
moved from chief executive of Univision to head of Telemundo last year,
says: 'For years we could not even get to see companies. Now we are being
called all the time to make presentations.'
The Hispanic marketing is fed not just by large numbers of Hispanics, but by
expected growth over the next decade. By 2000 Hispanic population is likely
be more than 30m, and will be at the point of overtaking blacks as the US's
largest minority. Consumer spending will have risen to Dollars 438bn, about
7 per cent of the then total, according to a study by DRI/McGraw Hill.
Hispanics already account for one out of four new households, according to
Doug Darfield, vice-president at Univision, and are crucial to businesses
hoping to capture new markets, especially in household goods. Since many
have just arrived in the US, they are easily influenced by advertisements,
not having well-established consumer tastes.
Hispanic advertisements that are straight translations of English ones
usually fail to work. Hispanics are younger, more family-orientated and less
knowledgeable about US consumer culture than Anglos. Even when mainstream
Anglo-style advertisements are translated, many Hispanics do not respond to
appropriately and may not even understand them.
US companies have drawn up distinctive campaigns to draw Hispanics to their
products. In Texas Coca-Cola runs advertisements with a well-known Hispanic
singer, Selina, hoping to convince Hispanic customers that Coca-Cola is
'talking to me, is relevant, says who I am', according to Bonnie Garcia, the
head of the Hispanic consumer market department at Coca-Cola.
Often companies have to tailor advertisments to local Hispanic markets,
since Hispanic consumers vary. The wealthy Cuban-American in Miami has
little in common with the poor Mexican-American in southern California, or
the Puerto-Rican in New York. Car advertisements in Miami might thus show a
flashy sports car, but in southern California a pick-up truck.
Occasionally companies send different, even conflicting messages to Anglo
and Hispanic consumers. Lionel Sosa, of Sosa Bromley Aguilar &amp; Associates,
contrasts an Anglo campaign of Western Union, that stresses speed at which
money is delivered ('the fastest way to save money'), with the Hispanic
slogan that stresses the safety ('uniting families for 120 years').
Not all Hispanic ads are so successful. David Flynn from the Hispanic arm of
GSD&amp;M, an agency in San Antonio, Texas, recalls a Hispanic ad for an
insurance company that portrayed an elderly woman in a nursing home, lauding
the benefits of her insurance coverage. Hispanics look after their ageing
parents and grandparents at home.

FT  22 JUL 93 / Technology: Consultant's Critique - Software at work
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN GRUMBALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The relationship with software suppliers is complicated. While Hoskyns
markets Data 3 in the UK, it does not have the rights in France. When
updates are released to ECIA plants in France, the French supplier has no
interest in helping Hoskyns - a direct competitor - to maintain the UK
version. HPC has the choice of missing updates or taking them in French. Its
choice of the latter must delight the parent company which encourages
workers to study foreign languages.
Making parts to order, rather than having long production runs has demanded
greater flexibility of Hill's staff. While McGilvray expected resistance,
the workers actually value the variety. This is in line with the predictions
of job design experts who suggest job satisfaction can be improved by
increasing variety and autonomy.
Underlying this is an implicit trust in the workforce. Twenty years ago,
wildcat strikes would have made the whole thing impossible. No manager would
have risked holding only a few hours' stock.
'Just in time' is an effective technique but a finely balanced one. Traffic
delays could bring production to a halt.
HPC keeps a five-day buffer of foam via a transport company. The foam
belongs to the manufacturer and does not appear on HPC's balance sheet. HPC
pays a small premium to hold the reservoir nearby. Such 'off-balance sheet'
stockholding must be a business opportunity for other intermediaries.
McGilvray has brought may changes to HPC, which has affected the bottom line
 -turnover and profit have increased dramatically. This is the acid test for
any system.
Lessons from this study:
Effective use of IT can transform production capability.
Just-in-time merely pushes your stockholding problem on to someone else.
Opportunities may be created for intermediaries to hold buffer stocks as
off-balance sheet items.

FT  22 JUL 93 / Accountancy Column: Food for thought in Polly Peck's bitter
harvest - Andrew Jack argues that the profession could have done more to
highlight problems in the group's affairs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE story of Polly Peck International, the fruit-to-electrics group, which
went from wonder stock to insolvency within a few weeks in 1990, is almost
as sorry a tale for accountancy as it is for Mr Asil Nadir, its founder.
The most prominent finger of blame must point to Mr Nadir, who has illegally
fled to his native northern Cyprus, jumping bail conditions while awaiting
criminal prosecution for theft, and facing civil action for the recovery of
misappropriations totalling at least Pounds 371m.
The reputations of those who have pursued him - notably the Serious Fraud
Office, the Stock Exchange and the Inland Revenue - are not entirely
untarnished. But the episode has shown many facets of accountancy in an
equally poor light: preparers and users of accounts, standards, auditors,
administrators and professional bodies.
It appears that Meyna. the group's Turkish fruit business, has a turnover
one-fifth of that claimed for it in the group accounts. Against reported
trading profits of TL195bn (Pounds 11.6m) for the first six months of 1990,
the management accounts for the full year show gross profits of just TL13bn
and an overall net loss.
Whether this could have been detected earlier is open to question. There is
evidence that Nadir blatantly misled his auditors on at least one occasion,
by failing to discuss his interest in 1989 in Impexbank, a Turkish bank
which was instrumental in channelling Polly Peck funds into his own personal
and private business activities.
But there were other areas which arguably should have aroused more suspicion
at the time. Meyna was one of several PPI subsidiaries whose reported
performance did not tally with reality. It was listed as the UK's second
largest capital investment in Turkey and was apparently generating
substantial sales. Yet local traders suggest it had no more than 5 per cent
of the market, and the margins were mysteriously well in excess of those of
its competitors.
In northern Cyprus, Sunzest, PPI's fruit exporter, was apparently supplying
more oranges than the island's entire annual crop; while Unipac, its
packaging company, seems to have been producing more boxes than there was
fruit to fill them.
While this evidence was anecdotal - and could usefully have been
supplemented by a few more trips from investors and commentators to the Near
East while PPI was still trading - other information in the published
accounts should have raised some eyebrows.
The geographical split shows profits from operations in the near and Middle
East consistently above 25 per cent, and still consistently furnishing
two-thirds of group profits in 1989 when its contribution to turnover had
fallen to 35 per cent. The ratio of net purchase of tangible fixed assets to
depreciation was also abnormally high.
Stocks, debtors and work-in-progress all strangely grew year by year to
substantial levels, more than doubling between 1988 and 1989 alone. So did
the number of days in debtors, creditors and stock. Were these figures ever
verified, or considered recoverable?
This is all before considering the frequently highlighted treatment of
foreign currency, by which Polly Peck booked to profits large amounts of
interest from cash on deposit in high-inflation, soft currency regions,
while pushing the exchange losses on conversion through reserves.
Equally, there was the delicacy of the group's cash position. Recasting its
latest source and application of funds statement to the format of FRS 1, the
Accounting Standard Board's cash flow equivalent, shows net outflows from
operating activities of Pounds 129m in 1989 alone - and rising fast.
Both the foreign currency and cash positions can be derived from the
published accounts, though they were apparently neglected or dismissed by
investors boosting the shares and analysts helping hype them even days
before the group went into administration.
Much more important was the large amount of cash supposedly on deposit in
northern Cyprus, and the highly material profits claimed as generated in the
region. Stoy Hayward, PPI's group auditor, says it relied for the audit of
these subsidiaries on Erdal and Co, a small local firm which it introduced
to Horwath International, the network to which it is affiliated.
Mr Paul Hipps, Stoy's senior partner, says two partners and one or two
managers went to northern Cyprus each year to examine Erdal's working
papers, and sometimes visited Turkey. He says the firm had no choice in
selecting Erdal, which was chosen by PPI.
The senior audit partner on the job has since died, it has no copies of the
working papers it inspected in northern Cyprus and Erdal refuses to supply
any now. Other auditors argue that if Stoy had doubts about the quality of
Erdal's work, it could have conducted its own audit on the subsidiaries, or
qualified the PPI accounts. It did neither.
The administrators to Polly Peck also cannot entirely escape criticism.
Their strategy of initially co-operating with Mr Nadir in the hope of
realising high proceeds seemed logical, but failed. Their approach since,
including considerable litigation, has so far cost more than the recoveries
it has generated. Current estimates give creditors up to 4p in the pound.
More important, the role of the disciplinary processes of the Institute of
Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, and the conduct of one of its
largest members, are unfortunate. Accountants from Coopers &amp; Lybrand carried
out many projects for PPI over the years and yet became administrators in
spite of ethical rules banning appointments when there has been a
'continuing professional relationship'.
Coopers claimed its internal systems were not able to pick up the conflicts.
That seems surprising in a firm offering computer consultancy to others, and
also since Mr Richard Stone, one of the administrators, was head of
corporate finance during some of the time his department was conducting work
for PPI.
The institute, as so often, appeared bound by existing archaic rules, which
limited the fines to just Pounds 1,000 to each of the two administrators,
and an examination of its systems.
Analysis with hindsight may be unfair, but it is likely to be causing a wry
smile on the lips of Mr Nadir. He would have had far less chance to throw a
smokescreen around his own conduct if those who tackled him had been more
unblemished in theirs.

FT  22 JUL 93 / Wales and south-west continue to recover
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM, Wales and West Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RECOVERY is continuing in Wales and south-west England, according to the
latest quarterly surveys by chambers of commerce.
Manufacturing is leading recovery in Wales with exporting companies showing
similar growth to the previous quarter, says the Wales Chamber of Commerce
and Industry.
A significant change is that 50 per cent of manufacturers report an increase
in home sales. The service sector is still lagging, with 38 per cent of
companies showing growth but 23 per cent declining.
Overall, confidence is high, with two-thirds of companies expecting improved
sales in the next 12 months. Thirty per cent of companies have increased
their investment plans for capital equipment.
An increase in investment plans is also reported in the south-west. A survey
by the Bristol Chamber of Commerce and Initiative says that nearly one in
three manufacturing companies plan to increase investment, with fewer than
one in 10 intending to cut it. In the service sector more than one in four
have increased investment plans, with 6 per cent planning cuts.
More than 60 per cent of companies have seen increases in sales in the last
quarter, with less than 10 per cent registering falls. Nearly half of
manufacturing companies say exports and orders are up, with about one in six
reporting falls.
In both regions smaller businesses plan to employ more staff. Larger
manufacturers are still shedding staffing.
