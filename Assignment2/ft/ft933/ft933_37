FT  22 JUL 93 / People: A bigger bite of the burger for Adamson
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
James Adamson, appointed chief operating officer of Grand Metropolitan's
Burger King worldwide operations in August last year, steps up to chief
executive officer.
He succeeds Barry Gibbons, who remains chairman of Burger King, but will now
undertake a broader management role, working with Ian Martin, GrandMet's
chief operating officer, on international brand development.
Gibbons, former chairman and managing director of GrandMet retailing,
masterminded the restructuring of the US fast food chain after its
acquisition in the 1989 takeover of Pillsbury. He is a member of GrandMet's
strategic operations committee, and has been tipped as a future main board
director.
Adamson (above) joined Burger King, which now operates 6,800 restaurants in
48 countries, at the end of 1991 from Revco, the US retail drug store chain,
where he was executive vice president, marketing.
As president of BK's business in the US, he was responsible for improvements
in service, marketing and profitability in the company-owned US outlets and
in the past year has led BK's expansion into new overseas markets.
In addition to his present worldwide operational responsibilities, he will
now assume overall management of marketing, finance, quality assurance, and
legal, personnel and external affairs.

FT  22 JUL 93 / Estate agents say market is still fragile
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FURTHER evidence of a slow-down in the pace of recovery in the housing
market is provided by a survey of more than 100 estate agents published
today by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors.
The institution has warned the chancellor not to introduce measures in his
autumn Budget which might undermine any recovery in house sales and prices.
It said: 'The recovery is still evident but it remains fragile. As we enter
the summer holiday period activity has slackened in line with the
traditional seasonal trend.'
Mr Peter Hayward of Peter Hayward Associates in Carlisle, Cumbria said:
'June has seen a tailing off in the level of demand from purchasers in spite
of attractive interest rates. The progressive surge in the market from the
turn of the year appears now to have dissipated.'
The institution said only 9 per cent of agents polled in England and Wales
reported increases in house prices in the previous three months. Most
reported static prices and 8.5 per cent reported falls.
Michael Everett, estate agents in Epsom, Surrey, said: 'A continued shortage
of new instructions is slowing the market and now causing difficulties in
completing sales.'
The institution said that the price expectation of prospective sellers was
still too high while buyers expected to find bargains.
This had led to a shortage of properties for sale with many sellers waiting
for signs of price rises before putting properties on the market.
A separate report by the Woolwich building society has estimated that the
number of home owners trapped in homes worth less than their mortgages has
fallen by a fifth as a result of price rises this year.
The society said price rises since March meant that about 350,000 owners,
mostly those who would have bought homes since last autumn, should no longer
be suffering from negative equity.
The largest fall is estimated to be in the south-east, where the number of
households with negative equity dropped by 51,000 to 404,000. Overall the
number of homeowners suffering from negative equity is estimated to have
fallen from 1.8m to 1.45m.
The society said that this was encouraging, but warned that the recovery in
the housing market remained fragile. It forecast that prices would rise by
only 1.7 per cent this year, leaving 1.25m householders still trapped in
homes worth less than the money they had borrowed to pay for them.

FT  22 JUL 93 / Building orders increase by 6%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONSTRUCTION orders jumped by 6 per cent during the three months to the end
of May compared with the corresponding months last year, according to
figures published yesterday by the Department of the Environment.
Orders also rose by 2 per cent compared with the previous three months.
Building industry leaders, however, said the figures belied the extent of
the downturn rather than pointing to a recovery in the industry, which was
still depressed in many parts.
Miss Joanne Cutler, economist at the Building Employers Confederation, said
that March had been a particularly good month for orders in the public
sector as authorities had rushed to spend their budgets before the end of
the financial year.
This had distorted comparisons with previous quarters. Indeed the
depart-ment's figures showed that orders had fallen in the two following
months, said Miss Cutler.
Contractors were particularly concerned that the government might reduce
public investment on construction as part of its effort to reduce a Pounds
50bn public sector borrowing requirement. This would compound recent
increases in the price of building materials which were squeezing
contractors' profit margins.
Government figures also revealed a 13 per cent increase in orders for
private housing and a 2 per cent increase in private industrial orders
compared with the corresponding months last year.

FT  22 JUL 93 / Non-EC trade gap narrows to Pounds 613m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A STRONG rise in the value of exports to countries outside the European
Community helped narrow the UK's non-EC trade gap last month.
The visible trade deficit - just under half the total of UK trade - narrowed
for the fourth successive month to a seasonally adjusted Pounds 613m in
June, compared with Pounds 770m in May.
The June deficit was the lowest for three years.
A 4.5 per cent month-on-month increase in export values was behind the
encouraging news. The sharp rise took exports to their highest ever levels
and encouraged hopes that buoyant manufacturing exports are leading the UK
out of recession.
Against the sharp rise in export values, import values rose by only 1 per
cent month-on-month.
The underlying deficit, which excludes oil and erratic items such as
aircraft and precious stones, dropped to Pounds 538m in June from Pounds
854m in May, the smallest deficit since July last year.
The good performance by exports was spread fairly evenly across industry.
The Central Statistical Office said that measured by volume, and excluding
oil and erratic items, exports and imports were rising by between 0.5 per
cent and 1 per cent per month.
In the past three months export volumes excluding oil and erratic items rose
by 15 per cent compared with the previous quarter and were 5.5 per cent
higher than figures for the corresponding period a year ago.
Underlying import volumes rose by 14 per cent on the previous quarter and 3
per cent compared with a year ago.
The trends since August last year - just before sterling left the exchange
rate mechanism of the European monetary system in September - show how UK
exporters have bene-fited from the pound's devaluation.
Export volumes excluding oil have risen by 21.5 per cent since August, while
import volumes have risen by 13.5 per cent.
The figures also indicate that exporters are using the competitive edge won
through devaluation to raise their prices.
The CSO said that since August last year, prices of non-oil exports to
countries outside the European Community have risen by 7.5 per cent.
Import prices measured on the same basis have risen by 10.5 per cent.
The UK imported more oil than it exported last month. The deficit in oil
trade was Pounds 196m compared with a small surplus of Pounds 13m in the
previous month.
For the third consecutive month, the UK exported more to the US than it
imported, sustaining a small surplus of Pounds 88m compared with a surplus
of Pounds 3m in the previous month.
Elsewhere, apart from the oil exporting countries, UK trade was in deficit.
A positive picture of the economy is presented in two surveys of business
confidence and business activity published yesterday.
The enterprise barometer, calculated by 3i, Britain's largest venture
capital group, measures business confidence among the owners of the private
businesses backed by 3i. It was at its highest level for nearly five years
in June.
A survey by the Association of British Factors and Discounters found a 25
per cent increase in the turnover of its members' clients to Pounds 4.7bn in
the second quarter of the year. This was the largest year-on-year increase
for more than six years, said the associ-ation.

FT  22 JUL 93 / Early summer sales lift retail figures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SHARP rise in retail sales volumes last month has supported indications of
a broadly based recovery.
The upturn was helped by an early start to the summer sales and a rebound
from May's poor figures for clothing, which were caused by wet weather.
Seasonally adjusted retail volumes rose 1.3 per cent in June to register a
3.9 per cent increase from June last year, the Central Statistical Office
said yesterday.
In the second quarter of the year sales volumes were 0.5 per cent higher
than in the first quarter, with shops selling food and household goods doing
particularly well.
The British Retail Consortium, a trade body for the sector, said retailing
had seen a 'sustained recovery' in the first half of the year. Although
retailers were encouraged, they remained concerned 'at the lack of solid
consumer confidence'.
The consortium said uncertainty in the housing market continued to hold back
purchases of furniture and carpets, while sales of televisions, hi-fi units
and video machines were low. Sales of healthcare and do-it-yourself products
were relatively buoyant.
The figures provide little evidence of any spurt in shopping activity, which
accounts for about a quarter of gross domestic product.
In the second quarter retail volumes were up 3.1 per cent from the
corresponding period last year, after a year-on-year rise of 3.4 per cent in
the first quarter. Between the fourth quarter of last year and the January
to March period sales volumes rose 1.7 per cent.
In the first half of this year sales volumes rose 2.3 per cent from the
second half of last year, after a 1 per cent increase between the first and
second halves of 1992.
Sales of most categories of retail goods appear to have been helped by heavy
dis-counting, largely in big stores.
Not allowing for seasonal variations and on a value basis, average weekly
shop sales in June are estimated by the CSO to be Pounds 2.74bn, only
marginally up on the Pounds 2.72bn in May and just below the Pounds 2.75bn
in April. The figure for June was 6 per cent up from June last year.
Volumes of clothing and footwear sold rose 8.9 per cent in June - a freak
result triggered by unusually low sales the previous month. Volumes of food
and household goods rose 0.3 per cent and 0.5 per cent on the same basis.
Compared with the second quarter of last year sales volumes in the latest
three months were up 2.9 per cent for food retailers. The comparable figures
for shops selling household goods and clothes and shoes were 8.5 per cent
and 2.5 per cent respectively.
Retailers selling a mixture of food and non-edible products saw sales
volumes increase 4 per cent in the second quarter compared with 12 months
earlier.

SPP, the Swedish life group, has reorganised the management structure of its
international property portfolio so as to integrate its UK subsidiary London
&amp; Edinburgh Trust, which incurred a loss of Pounds 448.6m in 1992, more
closely into its investment division. The regional holding company boards
have been replaced by a divisional structure.
Nicholas Sheehan is chief executive of the UK Property division; Gerald Kaye
is chief executive of the Continental Europe Property division; David
Sherwood is chief executive of the North America Property division and
Charles Saunders chief executive of Pacific Property division.
A group of former LET executives have formed Bawn Management, a property

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Cedric Scroggs, chief executive of Fisons, the pharmaceuticals and
scientific equipment company, has abolished the position of managing
director of the scientific equipment division.
Scroggs, who headed the division for 11 years, has decided the three
businesses - Curtin Matheson Scientific in the US, Fisons Scientific and
Fisons Instruments - enjoy little synergy and there is little point in
having an additional layer of management to deal with them.
Robert Lankester, 51, managing director of the scientific equipment
division, has therefore resigned from the company and the board.
Lankester joined Fisons in 1982 as group financial controller, and became
chairman of the horticulture division, now in the process of being sold, in
1989. He was made managing director of the scientific equipment division in
April 1992.
There will be a handful of redundancies at Fisons' hq and the heads of the
three business units within scientific equipment will report to Scroggs.

FT  22 JUL 93 / Pounds 800m in savings tax rebates unclaimed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORE THAN 6m people have failed to claim back Pounds 800m owed to them by
the Inland Revenue, the Commons public accounts committee reported
yesterday.
The money relates to tax paid on savings accounts since the abolition of
composite rate tax in April 1991.
Most of the potential claimants are pensioners, children and married women
not at work whose income is less than the annual allowance of Pounds 3,445
and so do not have to pay tax on interest earnings. They are eligible to
receive interest income gross of tax.
Thousands of other claimants with earnings below Pounds 6,000, who pay
income tax only at the lower 20 per cent band, are also failing to claim
back tax that has been charged on their accounts at a rate of 25 per cent.
In its report published yesterday the committee says it notes the Revenue's
efforts to encourage people to claim, and adds that it considers the Revenue
'should now establish the reason for the substantial shortfall in claims'.
The claimants are owed an average of about Pounds 130 each, the committee's
report says.
In spite of official encouragement for people to claim, including extensive
television and newspaper advertising, fewer than 1 1/2 m eligible people
have applied for refunds.
The report says the Revenue believed 'misunderstanding and a reluctance to
get involved in form filling' were responsible for lack of claims.
To complicate matters, a further 1m people have registered incorrectly,
again due to 'misunderstanding'.
Only five of the 24 Inland Revenue offices set up to deal with the expected
claims for repayment are used for this purpose. Of the remainder, four have
been closed and 15 diverted to other uses. The committee says it was worried
by the 'waste of expenditure'.
The report was also critical of apparent reluctance by the Revenue to
investigate the tax affairs of farmers, who are suspected of widespread
evasion.
The Revenue told the committee that farming 'had its own special mysteries,
and that there was a risk these could discourage the ordinary tax
inspector'.
The committee says: 'We do not regard this as an acceptable reason for not
pursuing tax in what appears clearly to be a high-risk area.' The Revenue is
also criticised in the report for duplicating repayments of corporation tax
and petroleum revenue tax totalling Pounds 50.4m.
The duplications were a result of 'serious systems' failures'.

FT  22 JUL 93 / MPs call for state aid to aerospace
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE AEROSPACE industry could suffer 'irreversible damage' without more
government support, a cross-party committee of MPs said yesterday.
The Commons trade and industry committee said aerospace was falling victim
to heavily subsidised competitors from other countries. Mr Richard Caborn,
its Labour chairman, called on the government to multiply its aid to the
sector five-fold to Pounds 100m.
The report said the UK aerospace industry's sales grew 1.5 per cent a year
between 1980 and 1991, less than half the rate of its main industrial
rivals. France had overtaken the UK to occupy the number two position behind
the US.
Without extra government help, the committee said, 'there is the possibility
of a gradual loss of market share as its technologies are surpassed by
competitors and ageing products fail to be replaced.' It added: 'The damage
would be done before it became obvious and would probably be irreversible.'
The committee put forward 19 recommendations, including one that the
Department of Trade and Industry conduct or commission a regular survey of
the level of government support for the industry compared with the support
given overseas. Other recommendations include:
The DTI funding more prototype development.
The government considering launching aid guarantees and defering payback to
help companies which develop products without launch aid.
The government and the aerospace industry compiling a national technology
acquisition plan for both military and civilian needs.
Parliament debating the Ministry of Defence's proposed purchase of a US
military transport aircraft to replace the RAF Hercules.
The report also called for a study of how to assist the conversion of
defence resources to civil use. But Mr Cranley Onslow, a Tory member of the
committee, said the government should not provide cash for companies to
diversify.
The Society of British Aerospace Manufacturers said the report's
recommendations 'reflect the solid consensus operating within the industry'.
The MoD and the DTI said they would be studying the report.
The select committee and the society welcomed the DTI's decision to adopt a
national strategic technology plan for aeronautics proposed by the DTI
aviation committee.

FT  22 JUL 93 / Travel brochure waste criticised
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TRAVEL industry throws away about 40 per cent of the 120m holiday
brochures printed each year, with many packages dumped unopened in bins and
skips, a report published yesterday says.
The report by Green Flag International, an environmental group set up in
1990 with support from tour operators, says the total annual cost of
printing holiday brochures is Pounds 86.5m - Pounds 20 for each booking.
Brochure printing accounts for more than 1m trees each year.
Only 10 per cent of UK tour operators use recycled paper or soluble inks,
the report says. A similar proportion operate a system enabling agents to
return unused brochures. Only 25 per cent sought environmental guidance on
brochure production.
Tour operators said recycled paper was unsuitable for brochures because it
was not strong or white enough and soluble inks were not of sufficiently
high quality.
Nearly two-thirds of the 30 travel agents questioned said they disposed of
unwanted brochures in council bins or skips. Only 17 per cent used a
recycling company.
Tour operators and travel agents said the best way to reduce waste would be
to improve brochure distribution. Travel agents said tour operators could
assist by delivering brochures only when ordered and by packing them in
smaller quantities.
The large tour operators said they intended to target their brochures more
carefully, sending the largest number to the best-performing travel agents.
Currently, the typical large operator works with between 4,000 and 4,500
travel agents.

FT  22 JUL 93 / Sedgefield battles with surprise rivals: With the new map of
assisted areas due tomorrow Chris Tighe reviews the fight for funds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN THE government reveals the redrawn map of assisted areas Mr John
Litherland, planning director for Sedgefield district council, will be
listening on his personal stereo at the office. It will be a tense moment.
For years the County Durham district has battled to replace jobs lost by the
rundown of traditional industries in its area. But this time round its
economic development team has been astonished to discover the identity of
its rivals.
For the announcement, expected tomorrow, will be of equal interest in the
south-east.
At a conference on economic development held as the recession hit southern
areas, Mr Litherland found himself in the company of delegates from the home
counties - even, he recalls, from Hertfordshire - searching for ways to
tackle the unfamiliar problem of unemployment.
'There was a degree of suspicion at their presence from people from the
longstanding assisted areas,' he admits. Caution, it seems, was merited.
'They were learning very quickly.' Just how quickly can be judged from the
intense competition unleashed last June when the government announced its
assisted areas review.
The map designates development areas and lower-ranked intermediate areas
where companies which set up or expand can qualify for regional selective
assistance and regional enterprise grants.
About 2,000 submissions pleading to retain, or gain, designation swamped the
Department of Trade and Industry.
Sedgefield district has more at stake than most. Its south-west is in the
Bishop Auckland travel-to-work-area, currently a development area. The rest
of the district is in Durham travel-to-work-area, an intermediate area.
According to DTI figures assistance grants worth Pounds 45.4m were approved
between 1984 and 1992 for companies in the Bishop Auckland area. In the
Durham area the figure was Pounds 12.5m.
Mr Litherland realised there could be no complacency about the review. The
Bishop Auckland area's jobless rate of 11.7 per cent, just 1.4 percentage
points above the British average, means its development area status could be
at risk.
The Durham status looks vulnerable too, due to below national average
unemployment. But by scouring the league table of the 322
travel-to-work-areas, Mr Litherland's team found a possible trump card.
Durham ranks seventh in youth unemployment.
Development area rating, Mr Litherland argues, is imperative to attract
job-creating inward investors. Sedgefield has netted many inward investors
including the Japanese electronics group Fujitsu, whose microchip
manufacturing site at Newton Aycliffe, an eventual investment of Pounds
600m, has been promised Pounds 30m in regional selective assistance.
Yet, in spite of many years of regional grants Sedgefield's job creation is
not even standing still.
The growth of small businesses has been unable to compensate for heavy job
losses by bigger companies. Total employment in the district fell from
35,000 in 1981 to 31,340 at the end of 1989.
Mr Litherland's southern rivals argue that they too face the challenge of
economic restructuring. But Mr Litherland said: 'The move out of recession
is likely to evaporate their problems. In our case it's going to be a
continuing battle to attempt to achieve self sustaining growth.'

FT  22 JUL 93 / Science research reforms detailed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT yesterday unveiled details of reforms aimed at directing
academic research in engineering and biology more closely to the needs of
industry.
The changes to science and technology research councils' areas of
responsibility, outlined in a white paper in May, include the dismantling of
the Science and Engineering Research Council and the creation of research
councils for biotechnology and biology (the BBSRC), and particle physics and
astronomy. (the PPSRC).
Other areas of the Science and Engineering Research Council's responsibility
will go to existing research councils in medicine, the natural environment
and engineering and physical sciences.
After the changes, which take effect from April next year, grant committees
will not have to divide one budget between such different areas as radio
astronomy and manufacturing technology.
The new research councils will also allocate research grants guided by the
advice of technology foresight exercises also established by the white
paper. These exercises are scheduled for next year to identify promising
areas of research for British industry.

FT  22 JUL 93 / Mercury's regulation plea
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MERCURY, the main competitor to British Telecommunications, yesterday called
for more 'focused' regulation of the telecoms industry. It also warned
against over-regulation.
Its call came in its response to draft proposals by Oftel, the industry
regulator, which would force BT to account separately for its 'retail' and
'network' businesses in an attempt to promote greater competition.
Rather than full accounting separation on Oftel's model, Mercury wants Oftel
to concentrate on prices that BT charges competitors for 'bottleneck'
services - those over which it has a virtual monopoly. The most significant
is access to BT's local network to 'deliver' calls the last leg of their
journey.
Mr Terry Rhodes, Mercury director of competition policy, said: 'We want to
see more focused regulation, not an increase in regulation all round.'
Mr Rhodes welcomed BT's proposal for a 'menu' of prices for particular
services as 'a big step in the right direction' - but said that the basis
for apportioning costs for each service needed to be refined.
Mercury's submission marks a significant development in its attitude to
regulation, reflecting its status as an increasingly effective competitor to
BT. The cable TV companies, still fighting to establish themselves, want to
see a bigger Oftel able to monitor and check BT's activities in detail.

FT  22 JUL 93 / Aid plan for Harris Tweed launched
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A Pounds 10M PLAN to revitalise the ailing Harris Tweed industry in the
Western Isles was launched yesterday.
If successful it will safeguard 400 jobs for weavers in Lewis and Harris.
As part of the plan, weavers will be asked to switch to new looms which
produce a cloth 150cm wide. Mr Derick Murray, a Lewis producer, said: 'All
our research shows the requirement of the international market is 150cm. Our
present 75cm width is just not favoured by clothing manufacturers.'
The new looms could cost each weaver about Pounds 4,000 - 30 per cent of the
total cost. The rest will be funded through the package on offer from
Western Isles Enterprise and the European Community.
Other elements of the Harris Tweed strategy are a Pounds 2m investment in
Stornoway's tweed finishing mills and a further Pounds 2m to be used on
promotion and marketing.
Highlands and Islands Enterprise expects to invest Pounds 3.8m, with the
mills and weavers putting up Pounds 4.25m. The rest of the Pounds 10m is
expected to come from further grants. Earlier this week the Harris Tweed
Authority was established to promote and protect the industry.

FT  22 JUL 93 / National Trust moves to promote organic farming
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NATIONAL Trust, the largest private landowner in England and Wales, is
to promote organic farming among its 1,200 tenant farmers.
Responding to demand from some of its 2m members, the trust yesterday said
it would launch an appeal in September to raise up to Pounds 250,000 for an
organic farming development fund to encourage farmers to reduce their use of
chemical fertilisers and pesticides.
The fund will assist farmers who wish to convert to organic methods and help
develop markets for their produce.
Mr John Young, the trust's rural affairs adviser, said: 'We're constantly
looking at methods of farming that are likely to be sustainable and have
less potential for damaging the environment.'
He added: 'Organic farming has the potential for moving out of its rather
cranky image to being a serious part of farming. If the trust can assist
people to see where organic farming has a future and where it hasn't, that
will be helpful.'
The trust owns 580,000 acres, of which 45 per cent is tenant-farmed.
Half-a-dozen of the trust's farms already use organic methods and others
have expressed interest, but Mr Young conceded that conventional farmers may
need convincing before they convert, given the risks and costs involved. He
saw the main potential for change in hill-farming, which accounts for more
than half the trust's farmland and already uses traditional methods.
The organic movement accounts for only 0.1 per cent of all farmland, while
organic produce has just 0.4 per cent of the food market, according to the
Soil Association, its main promoter. Further help for the organic movement
is expected from the government this autumn with the launch of a Pounds 1m
organic aid scheme.

FT  22 JUL 93 / Fears over IT tendering found
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CIVIL SERVICE computer specialists believe that contracting out government
information technology work to the private sector will reduce the quality of
the work and lead to a worse service for the public.
A survey published today in Government Computing magazine found that 60 per
cent of central government IT staff believe that contracting out would lead
to lower-quality work, while 70 per cent say that it would be bad for
standards of service and more than 80 per cent believe that data would be
less secure.
Companies bidding for Civil Service IT work believe these fears reflect
uncertainty in the service over the protracted period needed to put work out
to tender and to consider bids.
Mr John Staples, director of public-sector sales at EDS-Scicon - the company
leading one of the two consortia shortlisted for managing the Inland
Revenue's IT function - said: 'Because of the government's policy of open
procurement, people have a longer period of worry. Given the circumstances,
this result is understandable.'
The survey also found widespread concern among government IT staff over
salaries, pensions and job security if IT moves to the private sector.

FT  22 JUL 93 / Cable channels in satellite transfer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNITED ARTISTS Programming (UAP) will today launch two channels on the Astra
satellite system - Discovery and Bravo.
Both channels are already available to cable networks in the UK through
low-power satellites. The transfer to the latest Astra satellite extends
their reach and means that Discovery - with mainly documentary-entertainment
programmes - will be available to more than 3.3m homes in the UK and a total
of 6.8m homes in eight European countries.
Bravo, whose output is based on cult series such as The Man From UNCLE and
films such as Casablanca, will be available to more than 2.5m homes capable
of receiving cable or satellite in the UK.
From the beginning of September Discovery and Bravo will also be part of the
14-channel subscription package being marketed by British Sky Broadcasting,
the satellite venture in which Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, has a
stake.
Channels joining the BSkyB package will each receive 15p per subscriber per
month.
UAP - which is owned by TCI of Denver, the world's largest cable television

FT  22 JUL 93 / Goldman faces Maxwell action
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRUSTEES of two pension schemes formerly controlled by Robert Maxwell are
considering filing legal claims against Goldman Sachs, the US investment
bank, for up to Pounds 56m in connection with transactions it handled on
behalf of the schemes, the Commons social security committee was told
yesterday.
The funds are the proceeds of 25,000 shares in Maxwell Communication
Corporation purchased from the Mirror Group Newspapers scheme and the
Maxwell Communication Corporation works scheme by Goldman Sachs on the
instructions of Mr Kevin Maxwell on May 29 1991. The shares were later
re-purchased from Goldman by two Liechtenstein-based trusts controlled by
Maxwell family interests.
Goldman Sachs has said it was acting on Mr Kevin Maxwell's instructions when
it paid the proceeds not to the pension schemes but to Bishopsgate
Investment Trust, which Mr Kevin Maxwell described as a nominee company for
the pension-fund manager.
Separately, Mr Brian Tatch, chairman of the board of trustees to the MCC
works scheme, told the committee that he had met early yesterday with the
Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief regulatory watchdog,
regarding possible help in compelling Goldman Sachs to return the assets.
Mr Tatch said SIB informed the trustees that it is unlikely to have any
jurisdiction since the transaction appeared to have been booked in New York.
Mr Shaw has asked if the Securities and Exchange Commission, the US
watchdog, is investigating the transactions.
The pension funds have argued that Mr Kevin Maxwell did not have legal
authority to order specific transactions on behalf of the schemes, and that
Goldman Sachs should have taken more care to determine whether his
instructions were proper.
Goldman Sachs said yesterday: 'Detailed information about the trades has
been provided to all regulatory authorities which have asked about them. We
would expect to do the same if any additional inquiries are made. We believe
we acted properly in connection with these transactions.'

FT  22 JUL 93 / Arts body may face 10% cut in funding
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR PETER BROOKE, the national heritage secretary, yesterday asked the Arts
Council to report on how it would cope with a cut of 10 per cent or Pounds
700,000 in its administration costs.
But he said he did not intend to press it to adopt radical streamlining
proposals made in a Pounds 60,000 government-commissioned review by Price
Waterhouse, the management consultants.
Mr Brooke reaffirmed in a Commons statement the 'arm's-length principle' for
arts funding, saying the government's role was to set the council's 'legal,
financial and institutional framework'.
He said: 'It is not for the government to seek to intervene in matters of
artistic judgment, although there can be occasions when ministers can
properly act as a conduit for public and political opinion.'
MPs were told the council had until October to review its range of
activities.
Mr Brooke added that the council's membership would be cut from 20 to 16.
In the spring Mr Brooke asked Price Waterhouse to review the workings of the
council. It came up with three options, saving Pounds 429,000, Pounds
847,000 or Pounds 2.2m.
Mr Anthony Everitt, the council's secretary-general, said the announcement
was good news and 'a victory for common sense'.

FT  22 JUL 93 / Ministers threaten global acid rain target
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN international compromise on acid rain targets could be jeopardised by the
government's desire to protect demand for British coal.
A cabinet committee meeting last week agreed, after considerable
inter-departmental wrangling, that Britain would negotiate at a meeting next
month in Geneva for a cut of only 70 per cent in sul-phur emissions from
power stations - less than previously indicated.
Other countries, including Germany and Norway, will back tougher targets of
cuts up to 90 per cent for the new protocol for the European Commission for
Europe, which includes most European countries, the US and Canada. An
agreement is likely to be included in the EC Large Combustion Plant
Directive, which applies to power stations.
Britain's resistance to the toughest targets stems from the Department of
Trade and Industry's concern that power generators would then want to burn
more imported coal, which has a lower sulphur content than British coal, or
to increase the proportion of electricity generated from gas.
The Department of the Environment is concerned that this goes against years
of improved sulphur controls and will again earn Britain the tag 'dirty man
of Europe'. Tighter targets, though, will have to be accepted.
The government's consultation paper on sustainable development, launched
yesterday, said that new technology 'should have dealt with the main sources
of acid rain in the next 10 to 20 years' but that 'a few sensitive, upland
areas' would still be 'at risk'.
A senior DoE official said that by publishing the paper 'we are opening up a
large number of issues although we know that some of them are cans of worms
politically'.
The paper warns that economic growth and road traffic will make it difficult
to stabilise carbon dioxide emissions, implicated in global warming, after
the year 2000. The UK committed itself at the Rio Earth Summit last year to
bringing emissions back to 1990 levels in the year 2000.
The government seeks responses to the paper by September 30.

THE AFTERMATH of recession and a surge in development activity in the late

Thorpe, property advisers, have found.
Demand fell last year because of recessionary pressures, including the fall
in town-centre rents, which removed business parks' cost advantages. The

levels in 1989.

FT  22 JUL 93 / Privatised training provider fails
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ASTRA TRAINING Services, which was formed from the government-run Skills
Training Agency three years ago to operate former Department of Employment
training centres, is understood to have called in the receivers.
Astra, which has headquarters in Sheffield and operates training centres
throughout the country, provides services for companies and for Training and
Enterprise Councils. It is the biggest private-sector provider of training.
The government paid a Civil Service management buy-out team Pounds 11m to
take over 45 of the Skills Training Agency's 60 centres. Eight of the
centres were subsequently closed in a management effort to cut costs as
Astra, which was training about 12,000 people a year, ran into financial
difficulties. The original workforce of 2,500 at privatisation has been cut
to about 1,000.
Astra suffered in the recession as companies took more rigorous control of
their training budgets, restricting the numbers of staff sent for training
and the range of courses.

FT  22 JUL 93 / British Coal reveals loss of Pounds 588m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH COAL warned yesterday that more pits may have to close as it
announced losses for last year of Pounds 588m and outlined its most
pessimistic prognosis yet for coal sales.
Mr Neil Clarke, chairman, said that if electricity generators ran down coal
stocks at the rates they had indicated, there would be room in the market
for only about 8m tonnes in the next two years.
That is less than half than that expected when the coal white paper was
published three months ago. In addition Mr Clarke said that sales would be
concentrated heavily in 1994-95. 'Unless we can get more sales of coal to
generators then some closures will be required,' he said.
He would not predict how many, but executives at British Coal believe the
corporation will struggle to provide a future beyond the end of this
financial year for more than a handful of the 12 pits reprieved in March.
Mr Clarke said it was also possible that some of the 12 could replace 19
pits previously considered to be core mines.
In the year to March 27, operating profits improved for the third
consecutive year, up Pounds 123m to Pounds 545m. But a net profit of Pounds
185m in 1991-92 turned into a Pounds 588m loss as exceptional costs -
including providing for pit closures, the loss of 21,000 jobs since October
and writing down assets - amounted to Pounds 1.02bn. Turnover fell from
Pounds 3.99bn to Pounds 3.88bn. Deep-mine profits rose by Pounds 127m to
Pounds 341m.
Mr Clarke's forecasts assume that the generators will decrease their stocks
from 33m to 10m in the next two years. The scale of British Coal's sales
problem is highlighted by the amount of coal being stockpiled at pit heads.
Between 150,000 and 250,000 tonnes are being stored each week.
Mr Clarke said that 18 companies had paid the Pounds 10,000 bond necessary
to allow them to take part in the first stage of the bidding to run 19 pits
no longer wanted by British Coal. None was an international mining company.
Mr Clarke's salary rose from Pounds 228,900 to Pounds 234,360. Mr Kevan
Hunt, employee relations director, said the highest-paid miners were now
earning more than Pounds 50,000 a year.

FT  22 JUL 93 / BR maintenance arm to be sold
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH RAIL'S train maintenance activities, which employ 2,400 people
around the country, are to be privatised next year, the government announced
yesterday.
The move could mean heavy job losses because the operations will have to
compete with the private sector in an industry burdened by overcapacity. The
activities to be sold are the maintenance depots at Eastleigh, Doncaster,
Wolverton and Glasgow and other facilities at Chart Leacon, Ilford, and
Swindon.
The depots are responsible for heavy maintenance and repair of BR rolling
stock. Lighter maintenance activities will stay with BR - but on
privatisation will pass to Railtrack, the proposed track-owning company of
the railway.
Mr Roger Freeman, minister for public transport, said train maintenance was
suffering from overcapacity because of advances in rolling stock technology
in the last 20 to 30 years.
But he said the privatisation of BR's maintenance depots could bring
benefits because they would have greater freedom to diversify and compete
for work outside the railway supply industry.
The depots to be sold had a combined turnover of Pounds 228.3m in the
financial year 1992-93, but made only marginal profits.
Mr Freeman said he expected the depots to be sold either to private sector
companies or to internal buy-out teams, but he added: 'No one is going to
pretend in current economic circumstances that the sale will yield
significant sums of money.'

FT  22 JUL 93 / Thorp uranium testing faces court challenge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE POLLUTION inspectorate will today ask local councils and government
agencies for their response to proposals for uranium tests by British
Nuclear Fuels at its Thorp reprocessing plant at Sellafield.
Greenpeace, the environmental pressure group, said last night that if the
inspectorate allows the tests to go ahead without full public consultation
it will challenge the move in the courts on grounds that it prejudges the
outcome of the public consultation on Thorp's future, due to start within
weeks.
The consultation, expected to be completed by the end of the year, will
determine whether the government gives the Pounds 2.8bn plant a licence to
start full operation.
BNF has asked the inspectorate to let it run radioactive material through
Thorp's pipes to detect any technical problems at the plant, which has taken
nearly 10 years to build. It says that by commissioning the plant now, it
would save two months' delay in beginning full operation.
Greenpeace said that the tests would produce radioactive waste as the
uranium would contaminate pipework in the building. It said that the
government had not justified the creation of that radioactive waste.

FT  22 JUL 93 / Struggle to find mining investors: Operating profits are up
but, coal's future looks even more uncertain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT WAS hardly the perfect prelude to privatisation. Yesterday's results from
British Coal were not the worst in the corporation's 45 years in the public
sector - but they are potentially more harmful.
The reported losses for 1992-93 of Pounds 588m compare to the biggest loss
of Pounds 5bn in 1990 after the corporation initiated a capital
restructuring. But coming just months before the government is due to
present its coal privatisation bill to parliament they increase the
difficulties ministers have in persuading financiers and industrialists that
British Coal has a healthy future in the private sector.
The government will argue, as British Coal executives did yesterday, that
last year's losses were exceptional, brought about by an unusual combination
of heavy asset write-offs and pit closure costs.
The figure they will stress is the operating profit of Pounds 545m, some
Pounds 123m higher than the previous year and bettered only in 1986 when
there were unusual circumstances following the national pits strike. This is
indeed a success story and reflects a growing ability to bring costs under
control.
There has been an impressive increase in productivity to 7.49 tonnes per
manshift - after a doubling to 6.34 tonnes per manshift between 1985-86 and
the end of last year. Meanwhile overhead, or 'above pit', costs have been
halved in the past four years.
Both trends will continue in the current year as the corporation proceeds
with plans to reduce by half the number of white-collar staff and takes
advantage of government proposals to allow changes in working patterns among
miners by, for example, allowing them to work longer shifts.
Next year's operating profits will be affected by a fall in the price of
coal to electricity generators and a potential further decline in the
contribution from opencast operations which was, until last year, a
significant element in profits growth. In 1992-93, opencast contributed
Pounds 160m to operating profits, down from Pounds 171m in 1991-92.
The main factor affecting opencast was the increasing difficulty of winning
planning permission. Increased concern about the environment is likely to
reduce tonnages - down from 16.7m to 15m last year - still further.
Next year's exceptional losses are likely to be less onerous than in
1992-93. Mr Ray Proctor, British Coal finance director, said yesterday that
the Pounds 636m write-down of assets and stock, taken as an exceptional
loss, was intended to reflect the fall in prices in the current five-year
contracts with generators.
This means they are unlikely to be repeated when the corporation outlines
its annual report for this year, probably the last before privatisation.
Exceptional costs associated with pit closures will, however, recur in
1993-94. Last year's Pounds 235m is associated with 18 pits kept open for
more than six months after British Coal announced their closure.
Most of them are still being maintained, but not mined for more than three
months into this financial year. More pit closures are on the way among the
12 mines reprieved in March and possibly among the 19 core pits.
These closures will cost money to implement and will dent this year's
profitability and British Coal's image further. They may, however, help to
assure potential purchasers that the corporation is down to a size that the
market can sustain and that exceptional costs will end before the industry
is privatised.
The government's ability to sell British Coal will depend on a variety of
factors, including whether it splits the corporation up and whether it
underwrites potential subsidence. The crucial factor for any prospective
purchaser will be whether the coal can be sold.
The difficulty in predicting that was underlined yesterday when Mr Neil
Clarke, British Coal chairman, said the outlook had worsened considerably
since the white paper in March as nuclear power and gas had performed better
than expected.
British Coal now believes that on top of contracts it already has with
electricity generators there will be space in the market for 11m tonnes of
black fuels - coal or oil or orimulsion - which it could compete for.

FT  22 JUL 93 / Lottery launched with Dollars 10m first prize
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR STEFAN Mandel, the man who mastermined a controversial Dollars 27m win in
the US Virginia Lottery last year, yesterday launched what he claimed was
the world's richest lottery.
Mr Mandel announced in London that Globalot, a consortium of private
investors of which he is chairman, had been awarded a 50-year licence to run
an international lottery by Gibraltar.
The lottery, which will be drawn every three months, will have a first prize
of Dollars 10m (Pounds 6.66m), five second prizes of Dollars 1m each, 10
third prizes of Dollars 500,000 each as well as 20 prizes of Dollars 50,000
and 5,000 free tickets for the next lottery.
Higher first prizes such as the recent Dollars 100m prize in the US result
from the rolling over of jackpots.
Mr Mandel said that his lottery would not compete with low-ticket-price
lotteries such as that being launched in the UK next year. Tickets would
cost Dollars 100 and be bought directly from Globalot in Gibraltar by bank
draft or credit card.
Unlike the UK national lottery, where proceeds will go to good causes such
as charities, the arts, and sport, only 5 per cent of the proceeds of the
Globalot lottery will go to unnamed charities.
Advertising such a lottery is against the law in the UK and a number of
other European countries so Globalot will advertise in specialist media  -
such as international flight magazines.
A total of 300,000 tickets will be on sale for each of the Gibraltar
lotteries.
Mr Mandel, an Australian accountant, caused a sensation last year when he
put together a syndicate of more than 2,500 businessmen, each investing
Dollars 8,000, to use his system for winning lotteries.
The syndicate spent a total of Dollars 20m on tickets in Virginia to win a
Dollars 27m prize. Mr Mandel said: 'They made a 30 per cent profit and they
have still got their initial investment.'

FT  22 JUL 93 / MPs' BBC probe extended to ITV
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Commons national heritage committee, which is looking into the future of
the BBC, has decided to extend its range to include ITV.
Sir George Russell, chairman of the Independent Television Commission, and
top executives of the leading ITV companies will be called to give evidence
when the committee resumes its main hearings in October.
Mr Gerald Kaufman, the former Labour foreign affairs spokesman who chairs
the committee, said: 'We do not see how you can look at the BBC alone. If
you are looking at the BBC then you have to look at the whole spectrum of
British broadcasting and see how it will affect the future of the BBC.'
ITV companies are now being asked to submit evidence to the committee. The
government plans to publish a white paper on the future of the BBC early
next year as part of the process of renewing the corporation's royal
charter, which runs out at the end of 1996.
Earlier this month three senior ITV executives from Central, London Weekend
Television and the ITV Network Centre were called before the committee over
the proposal to move News at Ten. The executives received a hostile grilling
and it is clear that many of issues raised then persuaded the committee that
they wanted to hear more.

FT  22 JUL 93 / Business parks' vacancies hit 20%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE AFTERMATH of recession and a surge in development activity in the late
1980s has left a fifth of office space in business parks empty, DTZ Debenham
Thorpe, property advisers, have found, Vanessa Houlder writes.
The vacancy rate, higher than any other sector in the property industry,
reflects the immaturity of the market. Business parks emerged in the late
1980s as a result of a relaxation of planning controls and tenants' desire
to escape from town centres. Development reached a peak in 1990 when 17m sq
ft of space in business parks was built.
Wales and the east Midlands has the greatest proportion of empty space in
business parks, with 40 per cent on offer. The lowest rate is in Yorkshire
and Humberside with 10 per cent vacant.
Demand fell last year because of recessionary pressures, including the fall
in town-centre rents, which removed business parks' cost advantages. The
take-up of space last year fell to 3m sq ft, a 75 per cent drop on the peak
levels in 1989.
The most important users of business parks are the public sector and
industrial companies, which accounted for 45 per cent of all space occupied
on business parks between 1990 and last year.

FT  22 JUL 93 / Brooke launches fresh review of Arts Council
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR PETER BROOKE, the national heritage secretary, yesterday announced a
further review of the operation of the Arts Council, ignoring three
recommendations by Price Waterhouse, the consultants.
He told the House of Commons yesterday that the council had been given three
months to analyse its activities, assuming a cut in its costs of 10 per
cent, or Pounds 700,000. The council was free to outline what improvements
in its service it could make if it was subject to a smaller grant cut.
Mr Brooke reaffirmed the independence of the council, but made it clear he
was exploring ways to make it more accountable.
In the spring Mr Brooke asked Price Waterhouse to review the workings of the
council and suggest savings. It came up with three options, saving Pounds
429,000, Pounds 847,000 or Pounds 2.2m. The third option would drastically
reduce the council's role.
Mr Brooke confirmed the arm's-length principle on which the council is run,
but added: 'There could be occasions when ministers can properly act as a
conduit for public and political opinion.'
In the Commons yesterday, there was widespread criticism from MPs of the
council's recent decision to remove grants from 10 regional theatre
companies. Mr Brooke has suggested that the council explain the decision,
perhaps to the national heritage select committee.
Mr Brooke is shortly to decide on the size of the council's 1994-95 grant.
This year it is responsible for distributing Pounds 225m in government
subsidy to arts organisations.
Under presure from Mr Brooke the council may be forced to backtrack on its
policy of switching funding away from theatres towards contemporary dance
and the visual arts.
Mrs Ann Clwyd, shadow national heritage secretary, said the further review
meant 'more delay - more paralysis by yet more analysis'.

FT  22 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Brussels cocktail circuit wonders
if Major will stay the course
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
'WHEN will Mr Major go?' a senior Scandinavian diplomat inquired recently.
'And who will replace him?' The fate of Mr John Major's premiership has
generated much talk on the Brussels cocktail and caviar circuit.
The advantage of speculating about Mr Major and potential successors is that
it diverted diplomats' attention from some unpleasant truths.
The first is that less that two months after Danish voters gave new life to
Maastricht the treaty is again in difficulty. Whatever the outcome of
today's Commons votes, Lord Rees-Mogg's High Court challenge could delay
final ratification until late autumn.
Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, hinted at further delay after a
routine meeting of EC foreign ministers in Brussels. But he also pointed out
that Britain was not alone. Germany also faced legal problems with the
treaty.
Most EC leaders have been too polite to allude to the hearing before the
Federal Constitutional Court in Karlsruhe on whether Maastricht conforms
with Germany's constitution. Many preferred to ignore it.
Yet it is slowly dawning on the European Commission that the legal challenge
in Karlsruhe is serious. Perhaps the most important question is how Article
20 of the Basic Law, which says that 'all state power is rooted in the
people', can be reconciled with a treaty which transfers some of this power
 -the part dealing with economic and monetary policy - to new European
authorities of limited democratic accountability.
Assuming that the treaty is not derailed in the UK or Germany, Brussels has
a new deadline for ratification: January 1 1994. This coincides with the
second stage of economic and monetary union as set out in Maastricht.
Nevertheless the date is a full 12 months after Maastricht was originally
due to come into force. Earlier threats that the UK and (then) recalcitrant
Denmark risked being cut loose by the rest of the Community unless they
completed Maastricht ratification by July 1 1993 now look rather empty.
What is striking is how the recrimination of 1992 has evaporated in 1993. A
mood of sullen resignation permeates Brussels, best captured by Mr Jacques
Delors, president of the European Commission. Laid low with sciatica, he has
been unusually subdued, though this week's dawn deal on regional aid with
the member states shows his appetite for the big occasion.
Finally, there is the social chapter. Many Europeans wonder how Mr Major can
ignore a Commons vote in favour of an amendment which supporters claim would
nullify the treaty opt-out won by Britain in the Maastricht negotiations.
All EC member states believe that ratification of the treaty is more
important than Britain accepting the social chapter. But if Maastricht is
ratified, Britain's absence from the social policy table would become highly
contentious.
Mr Zygmunt Tyszkiewicz, secretary general of Unice, the European employers
confederation, argues that Britain's absence could mean the 11 pressing far
ahead of what business wants or needs.
Mr Tyszkiewicz wonders whether Mr Major's social chapter opt-out will look
so smart in say, five years' time, when a future UK government might decide
to return to the table, and would then have to accept a body of EC social
legislation on which it had no influence.

FT  22 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Maastricht warning to High Court
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN and JOHN WILLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MISS BETTY Boothroyd, the Speaker, yesterday delivered a stern warning to
the High Court not to trespass on the rights of the Commons when dealing
with the legal challenge to the Maastricht treaty launched by Lord
Rees-Mogg.
She stressed that she would 'take with great seriousness any potential
questioning of our proceedings in the courts'.
But one constitutional expert last night questioned whether the Speaker's
statement was relevant to the case brought by Lord Rees-Mogg.
Professor Trevor Hartley of the London School of Economics pointed out that
Lord Rees-Mogg was not challenging parliament in the courts. The application
for a judicial review was on the decision by the government to ratify the
treaty when only part of it has been approved by parliament.
'There have been cases when the courts have clashed with parliament,' he
said. 'But Lord Rees-Mogg's action is challenging the government, rather
than parliament.'
Miss Boothroyd made clear her determination to uphold the rights of the
Commons by making a public statement in response to a complaint by Mr Tony
Benn (Lab Chesterfield) instead of following normal procedure and dealing
with the matter by private letter.
He suggested that the process of judicial review invoked by Lord Rees-Mogg
was being extended with the courts being asked to decide whether parliament
as well as the government had exceeded its powers.
Miss Boothroyd refused to allow Mr Benn to open a discussion today on
whether the High Court had already breached Commons privileges before the
start of the debate on the government's refusal to accept the protocol to
the treaty on social policy.
In refusing to accord precedence today to Mr Benn's motion referring the
matter to the committee of privileges, Miss Boothroyd noted that MPs had
already approved the Maastricht bill before the High Court dealt with Lord
Rees-Mogg's application on Monday.
She said the bill was still being considered by the House of Lords at that
time so peers had to decide whether their privileges had been breached.
To cheers, she cited the protection given to parliament by the Bill of
Rights which placed a statutory prohibition on the questioning of its
proceedings.
Miss Boothroyd said the relevant article stated: 'The freedom of speech and
debates or proceedings in parliament ought not to be impeached or questioned
in any court or place out of parliament.'
She emphasised: 'I am sure that the House is entitled to expect, when the
case referred to by Mr Benn begins to be heard on Monday, that the bill of
rights will require to be fully respected by all those appearing before the
Court.'
Miss Boothroyd explained that a recent decision made by the House of Lords
in its judicial capacity permitted the courts to assess the significance of
words spoken in the Commons during the passage of bills in order to assist
in the interpretation of statutes. She said: 'This has exposed our
proceedings to possible questioning which was previously thought to be
impossible.'

FT  22 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: PM plays for high personal stakes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HE cannot afford to lose. The Maastricht treaty will survive a government
defeat in today's Commons vote on the social chapter. The same cannot be
said with confidence of Mr John Major.
Defeat could come in more than one form. Enough MPs might support Labour's
amendment demanding that British ratification is delayed until Mr Major
embraces the social chapter. A majority might vote down the government's own
motion asking for parliament's approval to complete the process.
The whole procedure could be left in limbo if neither Labour nor the
government score a decisive victory.
But the treaty would remain recoverable - through another vote in the House
of Commons, through a confidence motion which would force Tory Euro-sceptics
into line or through some combination of both.
The battle might drag on until the autumn but of one thing the cabinet's
most powerful members are certain: however difficult ratification might
prove the government could not survive abandonment of the treaty.
But speculation about the constitutional and legal manoeuvring which would
follow a defeat - much of Labour's rhetoric about the 'will of parliament'
smacks more of opportunism than constitutionalism - obscures the central
political point.
Maastricht is Mr Major's treaty. It was once his triumph. The social chapter
opt-out he negotiated for Britain was part of that now-tarnished victory. If
he cannot now command a majority for it in the House of Commons, his own
already much-diminished political authority could evaporate completely.
The parliamentary battle over Maastricht has dragged on now for 16 months,
widening and deepening the wounds which Europe has always inflicted on the
Conservative party. In the process Mr Major has lost much of the instinctive
respect that Tory backbenchers traditionally accord their leaders.
No one expects that a defeat today would trigger an immediate crisis for Mr
Major's leadership - particularly if it is followed by the expected
government victory in any confidence vote. But the prime minister would be
still more vulnerable to another outbreak of Tory panic in the autumn.
Within a few days the Christchurch by-election is expected to paint another
devastating picture of the government's unpopularity in the country. Mr
Major can then claim the refuge of the long summer parliamentary recess -
and hope that the strengthening economic recovery refloats his premiership.
But he should not underestimate the level of disenchantment in his own
party. His administration is perceived from within to lack coherence and
direction. His enemies are not alone in talking about the possibility of a
different leader.
So tonight he must win. He might well. In spite of the seemingly impossible
arithmetic thrown up by the combined forces of the opposition parties and
the Euro-sceptics, the mood at Westminster suggested that somehow the
government would find enough votes to scape through. Mr Major cannot afford
to admit any other option.

FT  22 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Government faces gloomy arithmetic
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE parliamentary arithmetic still looks against the government for
tonight's vote.
In theory the Conservatives should be able to rely on 332 MPs, giving them a
majority of 18 over all the opposition parties. Since Sir James Kilfedder,
the Ulster Popular Unionist MP has said that he will vote with the
government tonight, the paper majority rises to 20.
On this basis it would take only 11 Tory rebels to vote with the opposition
to defeat the government. Or the majority could be overturned if a smaller
number of rebels voted with the opposition and other Euro-sceptics
abstained.
Almost all the opposition parties have a clear interest in voting against
the government. Labour itself makes up 269 of the total. The 21 Liberal
Democrats are set to line up with Labour, along with the four Plaid Cymru
MPs, the four SDLP MPs, the three Scottish Nationalists and the three
Democratic Unionists.
The unknown factor is the Ulster unionists, with nine MPs, the fourth
largest party in the Commons.
While it is unlikely that they would vote with the government even if a deal
were reached, they might all abstain. If so, the government's paper majority
would rise to 29. This would mean that for ministers to be defeated 15
Tories would have to vote against their party. Again, if some sceptics
abstained, a government defeat would be achieved with fewer rebels voting
with the opposition.
State of the parties:
Conservative                              332
Labour                                    269
Liberal Democrats                          21
Ulster unionists                            9
Plaid Cymru                                 4
SDLP                                        4
SNP                                         3

FT  22 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Separate votes heighten uncertainty
over treaty - Not once but twice MPs will tonight stream through the lobbies
then crowd into the Commons chamber to hear the result of the social chapter
vote. Though they will be voting on the same issue, the two separate votes
mean that by the end of this evening the Commons could have reached any one
of four decisions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
What is the first vote?
MPs will vote first on Labour's amendment to the government motion.
This would say that the government should not ratify the Maastricht treaty
until it has committed itself to the social chapter.
What happens if it is passed?
MPs decide whether to approve the motion as amended. Normally this is a
formality. But with Maastricht nothing is simple and the Euro-sceptics
threaten to force a vote, even if the government reckons that one defeat is
enough and abstains at this point.
What happens if the motion as amended by Labour is passed?
Labour insists it would force the government to accept the social chapter.
Privately, ministers say that the government could press ahead to ratify the
treaty as signed, perhaps after a further debate.
Whatever its legal force a defeat would mean a motion of confidence in - or
censure of - the government early next week.
Although that debate too would be dominated by the social chapter, all sides
expect the government would win the vote.
What happens if Labour's amendment is defeated?
Ministers breathe a sigh of relief. But there is still a second vote, on
whether MPs approve the original motion, which merely notes the social
chapter.
But if the government defeats the opposition and the rebels on the first
vote, surely it will do the same on the second?
Not necessarily. Some Euro-sceptics see their best chance in frustrating
ratification in the 'limbo' or 'stalemate' scenario, in which having
rejected the amendment the Commons rejects the motion as well.
The Maastricht Act requires both Commons and Lords to have come to
resolutions on the social chapter before it comes into force.
Since rejecting a motion is not coming to a resolution on the social chapter
as the legislation requires, the act cannot take effect.
Unless it does, the UK cannot ratify the treaty.
Would that mean that the Maastricht treaty was dead because the UK could not
ratify?
No, but it would mean that a further debate, in which MPs did accept a
motion - any motion - on the social chapter, would be needed before the UK
could ratify.
Hardened rebels say that another debate would simply be a repeat performance
leading to a further government defeat.
But it is difficult to believe that the government would not win a later
debate, perhaps with help from the minor parties.
Does that mean that if MPs approve the Labour amendment but vote down the
motion as amended, then the same applies?
Yes. For the stalemate scenario to work it does not matter whether it is the
original or amended motion that MPs reject in the second vote.
So the only way to be certain that this is the last parliamentary debate on
Maastricht and the social chapter is for the government to win both votes
tonight?
Yes. It could be the government's most powerful argument.

FT  22 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Agreement reached over BR pension
plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN and ALISON SMITH

<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT and the trustees of the British Rail pension scheme reached
agreement yesterday on a plan to protect payments to pensioners after
privatisation if the scheme's investment income falls sharply.
Announcement of the agreement came in time to defuse a potential revolt in
the Lords over BR pensioners.
Lord Peyton of Yeovil, the former Tory transport minister, had tabled an
amendment to the privatisation legislation to safeguard pensioners'
benefits. Earlier this month he led a successful revolt against the
government when the Lords insisted that BR should be allowed to bid for
franchises.
The agreement was sought by the trustees of the scheme who warned that
future pensions could be 'at risk' without a government guarantee.
Under the agreement, the closed scheme to be set up for current and deferred
pensioners will be protected by an absolute guarantee to provide pension
payments uprated annually in line with the retail prices index. The closed
scheme may not use more than 40 per cent of any future surplus to enhance
benefits, with the remaining 60 per cent to be set aside as reserves.
The government will also appoint a director of the trustee company set up to
run the closed scheme whose consent will be required before any surplus is
distributed to members. The director will also need to agree overall
investment strategy and other matters which could have a big impact on the
scheme's finances.
For those BR employees who stay in the Joint Investment Scheme to be set up
in connection with private-sector rail employers following privatisation,
the government 'restates its commitment to ensuring that people retiring
from BR do so on terms no less favourable than hitherto'.
Earlier during yesterday's committee stage discussion of the bill the
government won by five votes a move to alter the procedures for dealing with
the pension schemes after privatisation in order to give pensioners the
right to petition parliament. The proposal was rejected by 151 votes to 145.

LABOUR leads all of Britain's local authority associations, following the
election of a Labour chairman by the Association of District Councils, John
Authers writes.
The ADC, which had been chaired by Conservatives continuously since it was
formed in 1974, elected Ms Margaret Singh, a Labour councillor from Reading,
Berkshire, at its biennial meeting yesterday.
But Labour does not have overall control of the ADC, and the previous Tory
chairman, Lady Elizabeth Anson, is now deputy chairman. Labour has 58 seats
on the ADC's council, with 55 for the Conservatives, 17 Liberal Democrats
and 11 Independents.

FT  22 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Smith to be first Labour leader to
address CBI
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR'S rapprochement with industry will take a further step in November
when Mr John Smith becomes the first leader of the party to address the
annual conference of the Confederation of British Industry.
Mr Smith also beats Mr John Major to become the first leader of one of
Britain's main political parties to address the CBI annual conference since
they began in 1977.
Mrs Margaret (now Baroness) Thatcher was invited in 1984 but pulled out at
the last moment to attend the funeral of Mrs Indira Gandhi, the Indian prime
minister. Mr Major has so far only addressed smaller CBI conferences and
dinners.
The CBI yesterday said the invitation to Mr Smith was part of efforts to
broaden the scope of its annual conference rather than an attempt to send a
political message to Downing Street. Even the attendance of ministers at the
annual gathering of Britain's industrial leaders is a relatively new
innovation, it said.
But Mr Smith is certain the use the opportunity to stress Labour's
commitment to gearing economic policies towards promoting manufacturing
industry through investment and training - and to attack the government's
record on the economy.
Addressing the CBI is a logical extension of the so-called 'prawn cocktail'
circuit of City lunches by senior Labour spokesmen before last year's
general election.
Last year Mr Howard Davies, the CBI's director-general, spoke at the annual
conference of the Trades Union Congress and is due to address a conference
later this year on manufacturing organised by the AEEU craft union. That
conference will also be addressed by Mr Smith.

FT  22 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: MP says report shows need for extra
teachers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN EXTRA 6,710 teachers will be needed next year to stop class sizes in
England and Wales rising, according to a report compiled by the Department
for Education and leaked yesterday to a Labour MP.
The report, drawn up by the Education Settlement Working Group, a body
involving representatives of local education authorities and civil servants
from the education and environment departments, predicts that the number of
nursery and primary pupils will rise by 66,000 next year, while secondary
pupils will increase by 54,000.
This would lead to an estimated pupil-teacher ratio of 17.99 to one (up from
17.66:1 in 1992-93, and 17.44:1 in 1991-92). The extra teachers would be
needed to stop the ratio increasing.
Mr Stephen Byers, the MP who published the report, said: 'If the government
is serious about providing high standards in our schools, they must respond
in a positive way to this report. Failure to do so will condemn a whole
generation of school children to a sub-standard education.'
A demographic shift and increased staying-on rates among 16-year-olds who
might previously have left school and looked for work are blamed for the
increase in numbers.
Local-authority associations meet Mr John Gummer, the environment secretary,
today to negotiate levels of standard spending. They are likely to use the
estimates in calling for extra funds.
The report's publication follows a letter to Mr John Patten, the education
secretary, from Mr David Hart, general secretary of the National Association
of Head Teachers, which said that pupil-teacher ratios had risen to an
unacceptable level.

FT  22 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Deal seems more likely than before
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A DEAL between the government and Unionist MPs appeared more of a
possibility last night as Mr John Major offered soothing words on the
province's constitutional future, Ralph Atkins writes.
As Ulster Unionist MPs said privately that they were looking for an
'enduring' agreement that would result in Northern Ireland being governed
more like other parts of the UK, the prime minister held out the prospect of
the province's constitutional status being written into a new Anglo-Irish
agreement.
No deal is expected to be struck until hours before tonight's vote. But Mr
Major said in a letter to Mr Kevin McNamara, Labour's Northern Ireland
spokesman, that talks could lead to a replacement to the 1985 Anglo-Irish
agreement and 'should provide the opportunity for an unambiguous
acknowledgement by all concerned of Northern Ireland's status within the
UK.'

FT  22 JUL 93 / World Trade News: Gatt in new study of banana regime
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DEVELOPING countries from rival groups of banana producers clashed yesterday
in the ruling council of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade over the
European Community's controversial banana import policies, Reuter reports
from Geneva.
The debate went on for three hours before being suspended until the next
session in September, according to trade officials. However, they said that
Gatt had now formed a panel to report on whether the EC's new regime, which,
like its predecessor, has also split the Community, violated international
fair trade rules.
Jamaica, a member of the Africa, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) group of former
colonies of European states, appealed for rejection of an earlier panel
report which declared the EC's previous banana import regulations to be in
violation of Gatt rules. 'Its conclusions could destroy the future of 69
developing nation states,' said Jamaica's ambassador, Mr Richard Pierce.
Costa Rica argued for approval, speaking for five Latin American states
whose bananas are subject to heavy EC duties and import ceilings.
The EC blocked approval of the report last month, but has since introduced
new rules imposing a tariff quota of 2m tonnes a year on non-ACP imports.
Earlier, the council agreed to work for early admission of Saudi Arabia as a
full member after the kingdom's application won support from Middle East and
Asian states.
The latter argued that Saudi entry would help Gatt move towards bringing in
all the world's trading states.

FT  22 JUL 93 / World Trade News: Few trade disputes are hard as steel -
Nancy Dunne finds that one company's protection could be another's ruin
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE WORK stations in the factory's tool and die room are decorated with
American flags. One also bears a slogan: 'Don't mess with the USA. Defend
firearms.'
This apparent fount of US chauvinism produces millions of tiny steel motor
vehicle fixtures a year, some so precise that they have a permissible error
margin less than half the width of a human hair. The star of the shop's many
production lines - a spark plug gasket - is judged so superior that it has
captured nearly 100 per cent of the US market and 15 per cent of Europe's.
The shell of H K Metalcraft of Lodi, New Jersey, is as meticulously crafted
as its products. It is cavernous, dazzlingly white with a single blue stripe
like a belt around its middle.
Safety and quality awards hang in the factory's reception area along with a
large photograph of its 52 beaming employees.
In the US there are thousands of small parts producers such as Metalcraft,
employing some 6m-8m workers. Mr Raymond Hopp, the president, is one of
those entrepreneurs President Bill Clinton wants to encourage with tax
breaks, manufacturing centres and other government aid.
But Mr Hopp is discouraged and dreading next year when the imported steel he
uses may be either unavailable or more expensive. He is one of the 1,200
members of the Precision Metal Association, which represents the US
metal-forming industry and uses half the flat-rolled steel in the country.
Flat-rolled prices have been rising since the US Commerce Department last
year began to investigate complaints from domestic steel producers that
imports from 19 countries have been subsidised or dumped - sold at 'less
than fair market value'.
If on July 27 the International Trade Commission of the US finds that the
imports have damaged American steel companies, then tariffs of up to 109 per
cent will be made permanent, and domestic prices will climb still higher.
Small steel users claim they employ more than 30 workers for every worker
employed by the giant steel companies, whose job may be saved by the dumping
and countervailing duties. But the small companies have little presence in
Washington, where massive layoffs from the giant steel companies have
attracted the most attention.
In an attempt to raise the profile of small companies such as Mr Hopp's,
1,400 small steel using companies have joined with steel traders of the
American Institute for International Steel; Nucor Corporation, the
successful mini-mill steel producer; and Rockwell International, the
aircraft manufacturer, to form the Coalition of American Businesses for
Stable Steel Supplies.
Mr Jon Jensen, the coalition spokesman, insists that steel imports are
bought for quality rather than price and are, in fact, purchased at prices
higher than those charged by domestic producers.
'Almost all imported steel purchased by PMA members is high precision
product not manufactured by US steelmakers,' he says.
He cites one example after another of companies injured by the steel
tariffs: an east coast manufacturer of baseball cleats (grip studs under
baseball shoes) forced to rely on lower quality American steel; a Midwestern
maker of electric wares whose steel prices have risen 10 per cent; a
California car parts manufacturer who says that the US steel he must buy to
replace imports is often rusty on arrival.
Because he has contracts with a steel service centre, Mr Hopp has yet to
suffer extensively from the new tariffs and duties but next year those
contracts will expire. If imports are less accessible, his business could
suffer. For one product he uses a high quality Japanese steel required by
the customer - a Japanese 'transplant' vehicle supplier.
For another he uses an imported high carbon steel, manufactured by only two
companies in Europe. It too is specified by his customer, a domestic vehicle
producer. And US car companies are now 'fussy, intolerant of error because
their customers are intolerant of poor quality'.
He is sceptical about the dumping and countervailing duty regime, observing
that every country subsidises in one form or another, and companies must
adapt.
'The product that made 50 per cent of our business in 1974 makes up 2 per
cent of our business today. We were making standard washers, and the
Japanese put us out of business. Then the Koreans put them out of business,
and the Taiwanese put them out of business and the People's Republic of
China put them out of business.
'That was a low-tech item. We have had to develop products which require
intellectual property. We have had to price the products aggressively. We
have had to compete, stay up to date, and continuously adapt to new
processes and conditions,' says Mr Hopp.
The only way he can adapt to the tariffs, he says, is to lay off two or
three workers. These are the good, high paying jobs Mr Clinton promises to
create. Highly trained by the company, most Metalcraft workers can perform
at least three jobs, when needed.
The average worker has been with the company for 10.5 years, receiving
bonuses at the end of profitable years.
Mr Hopp believes that if steel prices continue to rise he will lose the
European market share he struggled to gain over six years as well as some of
his American customers. Sales last year were Dollars 8m (Pounds 5.3m) and
could rise to Dollars 9.5m-Dollars 10m this year. Mr Hopp says he could add
jobs if he were not 'constrained in an artificial way'.

JAPAN'S construction ministry is making it less difficult for foreign
companies to enter the country's building materials market, an official told
Reuter in Tokyo.
Complex quality controls have made builders reluctant to use foreign
products in public works projects. They have had to check whether they
cleared the Japanese Industrial Standard and then apply for ministry
approval. Materials had to be checked at the construction site.
In future, contractors can entrust testing to two of the ministry's
affiliated research and testing organisations. The two will then issue
certificates to the contractors.

Joint venture hangs on lifting of embargo by Clinton administration

COCA-COLA has struck a Dollars 24.5m (Pounds 16.3m) deal to produce soft
drinks in Vietnam as soon as the US trade embargo is lifted, challenging its
rival Pepsi-Cola in the struggle for a fast-developing market of nearly 70m
people.
A contract to form a joint venture has been signed by Coca-Cola Indochina, a
company comprising bottlers F&amp;N Coca-Cola of Singapore and Thai Pure Drinks,
and Chuong Duong Beverage Factory, a former Coca-Cola bottler now controlled
by the ministry of light industry.
The money will be spent only if the Clinton administration lifts the
embargo, which could happen before the end of the year. US companies are
already allowed to sign - but not execute - Vietnamese contracts, and this
month Washington stopped blocking Vietnam's attempts to borrow from the
International Monetary Fund and other multilateral lenders.
Much of Coca-Cola's investment will go towards modernising Chuong Duong's
factory in Ho Chi Minh City.
More than 500m bottles of Coca-Cola a year were sold before the north's war
with the US and its south Vietnamese allies.
Pepsi-Cola and its partner International Beverage Company, a combination of
Singaporean investors and Vietnamese local government organisations, have
already announced plans for a Dollars 10m investment in Vietnam.
Pepsi officials say they could start production at a modern Ho Chi Minh City
factory within two weeks of the embargo being lifted; IBC already produces
Cadbury Schweppes carbonated drinks at the plant.
Miss Vietnam, 17-year-old Ms Ha Kien Anh, is to feature in Pepsi television
commercials that will be shot soon in Bangkok.
Pepsi has stolen a march on Coca-Cola in establishing bottling facilities in
both Burma and Cambodia, but Coca-Cola is a better known name than Pepsi in
much of south-east Asia, especially Vietnam.
Thousands of cases of canned Coca-Cola are smuggled into Vietnam and
Cambodia from neighbouring countries.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRANCE is planning to present proposals before the end of this month which
would give the European Community similar weapons against unfair trade to
those of the US, a senior French official said yesterday.
The government of Mr Edouard Balladur is expected to finalise next week
proposals aimed at making EC anti-dumping procedures 'more rapid and
automatic and less prone to political interference', while also broadening
the Community's scope to take unilateral action against unfair trade
practices.
They are likely to dispel any impression that France has 'gone soft' on the
Uruguay Round trade talks following its acquiescence in the June agreement
between the EC and the US to set a limit on European oilseeds production and
in this month's agreement among the G7 countries on tariff cuts to present
to other Gatt partners in Geneva.
France also plans to make new farm trade proposals in early September in
advance of the special joint council of EC foreign and farm ministers that
it has requested. The government still hopes enough of its Community
partners will realise that last November's Blair House agreement with the US
needs renegotiating.
On French calculations, the deal would cut the EC share of world cereal
exports from 15 to 8 per cent over six years. France also complains that
Brussels has yet to make provision for imports of 2m extra tonnes of cereals
and some 700,000 tonnes of meat which Washington claims the EC would have to
take in as a result of the Blair House deal.
The thrust of the French plan to make Europe's 'commercial defences' more
like those of the US would:
Set a strict timetable for the Commission to follow in receiving
anti-dumping complaints, opening inquiries, and imposing provisional duties.
The Commission would have less discretion to set aside, or delay, dumping
investigations on political grounds as Paris complains it has done in the
case of steel imports from eastern Europe.
Give the Commission less discretion to end dumping investigations by
accepting promises from exporters to raise their prices in the EC market.
Remove the reference to Gatt procedures in the EC's 1984 legislation which
effectively means the EC can only retaliate unilaterally against non-Gatt
member countries. Without this clause the EC would have the equivalent of
the US's retaliatory Section 301 at its disposal, Paris believes.

THE United Nations will continue to use force, as necessary, to disarm the
Somalia militias but recognises that the time has come for some 'fine
tuning' of the operation, a UN official said last night.
Responding to strong criticisms of UN tactics, particularly by Italy and
Germany, Mr Kofi Annan, under-secretary general for peacekeeping worldwide,
reaffirmed that the UN force 'has not detracted from its original mandate to
become a military operation.'
Disarmament of the Somali factions that have caused heavy UN casualties
would be pursued 'forcibly' in order to create a secure environment for
humanitarian aid and help rehabilitate Somalia. Mr Annan addressed delegates
in New York after another official complained in Geneva about the disparity
between spending on 'military protection' and humanitarian relief.
Mr Jan Eliasson, UN under-secretary general for humanitarian affairs,
estimated that the international community would be spending Dollars 10 on
military operations in a budget of Dollars 1.5bn over 12 months for every
dollar spent on relief. He said there was a risk that military actions in
Mogadishu could marginalise the UN's humanitarian role.
However, Mr Annan said that, for the first time, the Security Council had
approved enforcement measures to achieve humanitarian goals. Only the
Council could change the force mandate in response to what he termed 'the
Aideed distraction' - the attacks on the UN by General Mohammed Farah
Aideed's militias.

FT  22 JUL 93 / Nigerian poll talks boycotted

<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Ibrahim Babangida's plan to re-run Nigeria's presidential
elections on August 14 was set back yesterday when the Social Democratic
party boycotted a meeting called to arrange the poll, writes Paul Adams in
Lagos.
The SDP decision comes as the rift widens between the military government
and an increasingly critical judicial system and the press. General
Babangida this week banned recourse to the law courts by opponents and
threatened more curbs on press freedom. There is increasingly bold criticism
of the annulment of the June elections by elder statesmen and active
politicians of both parties, and detailed press reporting of divisions and
indecision within the ruling military hierarchy.
Yesterday's meeting had been called by the National Electoral Commission
(NEC) under a new chairman, Professor Edet Uya, responsible for organising
fresh elections. So far only one party is prepared to take part, the
National Republican Convention (NRC), which claims its poor showing in June
was because the polls were flawed and accuses the SDP of using illegal
tactics.
The SDP candidate, Mr Moshood Abiola, who had a clear lead when counting was
stopped, says fresh elections are unjustified. Mr Abiola has taken the
government to the high court in Lagos to restrain it from holding fresh
elections, and applied to the Supreme Court to overrule the annulment of the
June 12 polls.
However, one of the four recent military decrees seems to have deprived Mr
Abiola of legal recourse by depriving the courts of jurisdiction in suits
challenging the poll annulment.
Critics of the government say the new timetable is impracticable and the SDP
has warned that any attempt to hold elections in Lagos and other big cities
of the south-west, heartland of Mr Abiola's support, will lead to violence.
Gen Olusegun Obasanjo, former head of state, and other retired civilian and
military leaders have twice in the past week condemned President Babangida's
manipulation of the electoral process, coupled with warnings of catastrophe
for Nigeria if the government continues on its course.

RIVAL faction leaders are circling above Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the Japanese
prime minister, who is supposed to resign at a meeting today of his Liberal
Democratic party to take responsibility for its loss of a parliamentary
majority.
The rush to replace Mr Miyazawa, who has refused to admit that he will
resign, became particularly unseemly yesterday, as the ailing Mr Michio
Watanabe, the foreign minister, announced that he would 'stake my life' on
leading the party and the country.
His comment had eerie overtones, as Mr Watanabe, whose health has clearly
deteriorated in recent months, was hospitalised twice in the past year, once
for a 'gallstone' problem and again for a 'cold'.
He is widely reported to be suffering a far more serious illness.
The bickering among the LDP's five factions suggests that the party does not
realise that it has lost its grip on power and must find a coalition partner
to ensure that its candidate for prime minister is chosen at an
extraordinary session of parliament early next month.
Mr Hiroshi Mitsuzuka, the head of the party's largest faction, also wants to
be the next leader, although both he and Mr Watanabe have opposed the reform
of the political system and are likely to be unacceptable to most of the
LDP's potential coalition partners.
Newer parties such as the Japan New party and the Japan Renewal party,
itself a former LDP faction, will face criticism from members if a deal is
done with an old-style LDP faction head.
A more acceptable candidate would be Mr Toshiki Kaifu, who was dumped by the
LDP as prime minister two years ago after proposing political reforms
similar to those now being debated.
An opinion poll conducted by Jiji, the Japanese news agency, found that 19
per cent of respondents preferred Mr Kaifu as the next prime minister,
topping the 12.7 per cent of Mr Tsutomu Hata, the JRP leader, and the 9 per
cent of Mr Ryutaro Hashimoto, the former finance minister.
However, Mr Mitsuzuka was thought a 'desirable' prime minister by only 0.2
per cent of those surveyed, and the outspoken Mr Watanabe did a little
better at 1.6 per cent.
Apart from his health problems, Mr Watanabe is generally viewed as too
erratic to be prime minister.

FT  22 JUL 93 / Accord reached in Hyundai dispute
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
LABOUR and management at Hyundai Motor reached a tentative wage accord at
dawn yesterday as several thousand riot police gathered outside the
company's plant ready to suppress a month-long strike.
The 11th-hour agreement, which is expected to be approved by the
20,000-member workforce tomorrow, is seen as breaking the back of the labour
dispute that has disrupted South Korea's largest industrial group. Hyundai
Motor is the biggest of the nine Hyundai companies now engaged in some form
of industrial action.
The government on Tuesday ordered that Hyundai Motor workers immediately
suspend their action or face a confrontion with 10,000 riot police deployed
to the car facility in the southeastern city of Ulsan.
With the government's threat to use force, labour and management quickly
reached a compromise settlement. The company trade union agreed to accept a
4.73 wage increase instead of the 16.5 pay rise it had been seeking.
In return, the company increased fringe benefits, including special
allowances, higher bonuses, and housing subsidies, and more holidays.
Meanwhile, 1,000 police conducted a raid on the facilities of Hyundai
Precision &amp; Industry in Changwon to oust 400 workers who had barricaded
themselves inside the plant for the past three days.
The government said the raid was justified because the company is a defence
contractor, whose employees are forbidden by law to strike.
Although the new civilian government of Mr Kim Young-sam has promised to
improve labour relations, it said its use of emergency powers to end the
strike was necessary because the dispute threatened national economic
recovery. The dispute has reduced GNP growth by 0.17 per cent and cut
exports by 0.32 per cent for 1993, according to the Bank of Korea, the
central bank.
Hyundai estimates sales losses at Hyundai Motor, the country's leading motor
vehicle maker, amount to Won390bn (Pounds 325m), followed by Won78bn at
Hyundai Precision &amp; Industry and Won69bn at Hyundai Heavy Industries, its
shipbuilding unit.

FT  22 JUL 93 / Israel debates new stance on Palestinians: Peace talks
initiative
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   JERUSALEM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ISRAEL is hammering out a new formula to present to the Palestinians to
unblock the Middle East peace process, Mr Shimon Peres, foreign minister,
said yesterday.
In an interview in Jerusalem Mr Peres said the government was moving towards
a compromise package which would seek to sidestep the two thorny issues
blocking the 21-month-old peace talks - territorial control over Arab East
Jerusalem and legal jurisdiction over settlers in the occupied territories
during an interim period of Palestinian self-government.
Mr Peres said among the incentives Israel could offer the Palestinians in
return for acceptance of such a package were: greater economic assistance in
the occupied territories; a commitment in principle by Israel that the final
status of a Palestinian entity will be confederation with Jordan; and the
so-called 'Gaza first' option - handing over control of the occupied Gaza
strip to a Palestinian authority immediately, leaving the status of the
occupied West Bank to later negotiations.
After 10 rounds of talks, the foreign minister said, both sides had become
bogged down by definitions and difficulties of convincing their
constituencies that they had not given anything away. 'We are trying to meet
the problems and build a package both sides can accept,' Mr Peres said.
'Let us sign what we agree on now and leave the rest to later,' he said.
Mr Peres said the advantage of the 'Gaza first' option was that it avoided
the problem of control of Arab East Jerusalem and the problem of Jewish
settlers - most of whom live in the occupied West Bank.
He also said the idea of confederation was a good compromise to all sides
because it 'calmed' Israeli fears of an aggressive independent Palestinian
state and 'calmed' Palestinian fears because it committed Israel to giving
back occupied land.
But he said a final accord on confederation could not be negotiated now
because that would need an agreement on borders which could only be drawn up
after an interim period of confidence building. 'We can talk about final
status now without defining it,' he said.
Mr Peres restated that the government would not offer any new compromise
over Arab East Jerusalem. He also said the visit of Mr Warren Christopher,
the US secretary of state, to the region soon was meant to keep the talks
alive.
On peace talks with Syria the veteran Labour politician said the government
was still waiting for a Syrian commitment to full peace before specifying
how far it was prepared to withdraw from the occupied Golan Heights.
However, he said he believed President Hafez al-Assad was preparing the
Syrian public for full peace.

FT  22 JUL 93 / Kenyans close bank in bid to placate donors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE KENYAN government has closed down a scandal-tainted local bank, an
important step towards mending relations with the World Bank and other
donors.
Exchange Bank and its sister trading company Goldenberg International were
at the centre of a scandal based on 'ghost exports' of gold and diamond
jewellery to Switzerland and Dubai.
By forging export receipts for more than Dollars 50m (Pounds 33.3m) worth of
jewellery, Exchange Bank was able to bid for scarce foreign exchange at
central bank auctions and obtain a 35 per cent refund from the government on
its fictitious exports.
When Exchange Bank ran into trouble in May the Central Bank of Kenya bailed
it out with an advance of Ks15bn (Pounds 128m) in short-term Treasury bills.
To date there is no evidence that this has been repaid.
The scandal was one of the big issues worrying the World Bank and
International Monetary Fund. IMF officials, who have visited Kenya four
times in as many months, had insisted that action be taken to clean up the
financial system as a pre-condition for resumption of balance of payments
assistance, suspended in November 1991.
On Monday a short statement signed by Mr Musalia Mudavadi, finance minister,
said Exchange Bank was being closed immediately following the results of an
external audit into its operations.
'Its records are not in order and not kept up to date. Moreover, there is
evidence of malpractice,' Mr Mudavadi's statement said. 'Its management has
tended to engage in speculative activities which are not only inconsistent
with established banking practices but are prejudicial to the interests of
depositors and the general public.'
Four other financial institutions, dubbed 'political banks' due to the
patronage they enjoy from high-ranking members of government, are also being
subjected to external audits at the request of the IMF. The opposition
FORD-Kenya party, which has led a campaign to expose the activities of the
'political banks', yesterday welcomed Mr Mudavadi's decision.
'Exchange Bank, along with a handful of other banks, threatened the fabric
of Kenya's financial and economic infrastructure and are a major cause of
our inflation problems,' said Mr Robert Shaw, FORD-Kenya's economic
spokesman.
Mr Shaw urged the government to arrest and charge the owners and directors
of the bank with economic sabotage. He said government and central bank
officials who aided Exchange Bank in its operations should be dismissed and
prosecuted.
Mr Mudavadi, who took over the finance portfolio in January, has won the
respect of foreign bankers in Nairobi for his efforts to clean up the
banking system.
Financial corruption lies at the heart of the political patronage enjoyed by
leading members of President Daniel arap Moi's government, but foreign
bankers question whether Mr Mudavadi has sufficient clout within government
to force the sacking of corrupt officials.
Vice-President George Saitoti, the former finance minister, who is also
minister for planning and development, last month defended the operations of
Exchange Bank in parliament, saying he had approved them in compliance with
the law.

FT  22 JUL 93 / Violence pervades path of progress: Patti Waldmeir says
western-style democracy may not solve South Africa's problems
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATTI WALDMEIR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE is a simple explanation for violence in South Africa: the African
National Congress and the Inkatha Freedom party are fighting for power ahead
of the first multi-racial elections, while the police either exacerbate or
at least fail to halt the killing.
If only the truth could be as simple as the explanation.
For the real causes of violence are manifold and baffling, to insider and
outsider alike, but certainly politics is only part of the problem.
Depending on the township, or hostel, or rural area where violence takes
place, 'the problem' can involve everything from a negligent or frightened
police force, to right-wing provocation, from commercial rivalry over taxi
routes to ethnic hostility.
At Port Shepstone, on Natal's palm-fringed Indian Ocean coast, where well
over 200 people have died since South African politics were liberalised four
years ago, the clash involves two centuries, two generations, two forms of
culture - every bit as much as the two standard political contestants, the
ANC and Inkatha.
While the white town of Port Shepstone, 100km south of the port of Durban,
looks like any other small rural town in the industrialised world, the
hinterland is Africa: traditional Zulu chiefs rule by a strict tribal
hierarchy inherited from the great Zulu kings of the 19th century - and the
standard of living recalls the last century, as much as the political
structure.
Everyone agrees that the trouble in Port Shepstone - which began with the
1989 killing of an 'induna' or village headman, by radical young men who
challenged his authority - did not begin as a political conflict.
Armstrong Zondi, one of the angry young men involved in the 1989 violence,
says the flashpoint was the local induna's decision to levy a R36 (Pounds 7)
annual charge on every youth over 16 - a crippling charge in an area with
little youth employment, viewed as simple extortion by the local community
which accused the induna of corruption.
Armstrong admits that the youths 'necklaced' the induna (he burnt to death
after having a flaming tyre placed over his head), causing the local 'nkosi'
(chief) to flee in terror. The community then elected a local council to
replace the banished tribal authority.
Since then, the chief, Nkosi Ndwalani has fought back with a vengeance,
returning to his seat with arms, and engaging in a conflict which has left
scores dead on both sides: radical youth, exposed to more modern ideas of
egalitarianism, have fought men like the chief, whose vested interests
incline them to protect the traditions of an ancient culture.
Inevitably, the political parties have weighed into the battle, with the
young 'comrades' supporting the ANC (and receiving its backing), and their
elders operating under the banner of the traditionalist Inkatha party (which
controls the government of the KwaZulu black homeland, the authority which
appoints the chiefs and pays their salaries).
The two sides called a truce late last year until the April assassination of
ANC leader Chris Hani raised temperatures once again. Now the murders have
started again.
Nkosi Ndwalani, holding court in his home atop a steep hill with fine sea
views, says the problem is simple. 'Where the people accept my role as
tribal authority, there is peace.' His indunas and councillors, who creep
with bent head and servile gesture into his presence, assent quietly.
In the valley nearby, Armstrong says the ANC is not fighting the chiefs:
'the chiefs stand for our customs and I don't think we should do away with
our customs.' But they must abandon their authoritarian ways and act
democratically; they will lose most of their traditional powers and be left
mainly as cultural figureheads (though ANC officials make the unlikely
promise that an ANC government will pay them more for this role than they
currently receive from KwaZulu).
This, like so many of South Africa's conflicts, is a battle which
western-style democracy will find hard to resolve. As other African
countries have discovered, tribal customs and values can become sources of
tension if ignored or overridden by governments. It is a lesson which any
new leader ignores at his peril.

MOVES to damp economic activity in China will lop about 1 percentage point
off Hong Kong's economic growth next year, Mr Hamish Macleod, the colony's
financial secretary, said yesterday, Simon Holberton reports from Hong Kong.
He said he accepted predictions by private economic forecasters that the
colony's growth would be affected by the measures announced in China to deal
with overheating. However, he stood by his March budget forecast of 5.5 per
cent growth in gross domestic product for 1993. He would not make a 1994
prediction but most forecasters expect about 4.5 per cent.
He said he believed the Chinese authorities would be successful in cooling
economic growth on the mainland. 'When the centre (Beijing) makes it plain
that it has a policy priority, sends teams to the provinces, and shifts
people from their jobs I think it will be taken seriously.'

FT  22 JUL 93 / UN will not ease sanctions against Iraq
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE United Nations Security Council yesterday agreed that full-scale
sanctions must remain in force against Iraq, regardless of reported progress
on the issue of eliminating the country's weapons of mass destruction.
However, Britain's Sir David Hannay, the Council president, emphasised that
the decision was not 'judgmental' in advance of a report members were due to
receive today from Mr Rolf Ekeus, a senior UN official. Mr Ekeus completed
negotiations with Baghdad this week on a weapons inspection programme.
Iraq agreed to long-term monitoring after provoking a crisis by refusing
surveillance cameras at two missile sites. The change in approach was
related to an attempt by President Saddam Hussein to have sanctions lifted.
The imposition of sanctions is reported to have caused serious shortages of
food and medicines and fuelled soaring prices.
Sir David termed Mr Ekeus's success 'extremely welcome' but he added that
what the Council wanted from Iraq were 'deeds not words'. Mr Saddam has a
record of broken promises that have repeatedly brought Iraq into
confrontation with the UN, only to see him back off under the threat of
possible military action.
Talks between Iraq and the UN on a limited resumption of Iraqi oil exports
remained suspended last night as officials still awaited an announcement by
Baghdad on the return of its negotiating team to New York.
Sir David made it clear in remarks to reporters that an eventual deal would
not result in the automatic release of Dollars 1.6bn (Pounds 1.06bn) worth
of Iraqi oil approved by the Council nearly two years ago. This would
require a new resolution on the basis of a report by Mr Boutros Boutros
Ghali, the secretary-general, and a determination whether Iraq had complied
with all relevant conditions.
Much of the proceeds of the proposed limited sale, which would continue for
six months and involve about 550,000 b/d, would be spent on food, medicines
and other humanitarian needs.
Although both the UN and the Iraqis have been tight-lipped about the
negotiations, it is widely believed that UN monitoring may be an obstacle
for Baghdad. Reuter adds from London: Mr Douglas Hurd, UK foreign secretary,
yesterday promised British support for a new international campaign to free
Kuwaitis still held in Iraq after the Gulf war and warned Baghdad the west
had not ruled out the use of force.
He said Iraq's 'persistent failure' to account for missing Kuwaitis and
other nationals held since the 1991 war to eject Iraq from Kuwait would be
raised at the UN Security Council review of sanctions.

Rebels operating from Afghanistan shelled a border post in Tajikistan on
Tuesday night, injuring at least two Russian soldiers, the commander of
Russian troops in the former Soviet republic said yesterday, Reuter reports
from Moscow.
He told local journalists that the rebels, who fled to Afghanistan last year
after being defeated in a near civil war, had shelled the southern 10th
border post.
The two injured men were serving with the Russian 201st motorised infantry
division, which has been pressed into action to help border guards and Tajik
troops deal with the rebels.
Moscow reacted swiftly after a big rebel attack last week in which 25 border
guards were killed, sending in troop reinforcements to the Central Asian
republic and setting up a new command structure to help counter the attacks.
Russia's Itar-Tass news agency reported serious clashes in the area and said
the situation at a string of border posts along the mountainous frontier was
'extremely serious'.

US officials said earlier in the week in Washington that the administration,

mounting evidence that China was shipping M-11 missile technology to
Pakistan, would be raised by Mr Warren Christopher, secretary of state, when

India's northeastern states were cut off from the rest of the country
yesterday as floods, which have caused the deaths of more than 500 people in
the north and west, spread to new areas, Reuter reports from New Delhi.
United News of India agency said army and air force personnel were trying to
restore railway links in the northeast, broken on Tuesday night after a
railway bridge was washed away in West Bengal. The only highway linking
Assam to Bengal and the Indian mainland was also under water, it said.

President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt was set to win parliamentary approval last
night to run unopposed for a third six-year term as the country's leader,
Mark Nicholson writes from Cairo. The vote is a formality since 98 per cent
of the People's Assembly's 454 elected members have already sworn their
support for his nomination.
His nomination must then be endorsed by a referendum in October, when he
will need a simple majority of votes cast. This too is expected to be little
more than a formality; he secured 97 per cent of the vote last time.

FT  22 JUL 93 / Small streams bring big floods: The mighty Mississippi and
the little River des Peres
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DOWNTOWN St Louis remains safe and dry behind its massive floodwall, but the
city's southern fringes have begun to suffer in earnest after weeks of
relentless rain.
With the ground waterlogged and drainage streams already filled to
overflowing, every new thunderstorm sends the Missouri and Mississippi
rivers ever higher to set new flood records.
But although the Mississippi reached a new crest yesterday at 47 feet, it
remained 5 feet below the lip of the city floodwall.
It was a much smaller stream, the River des Peres, which took its revenge on
south St Louis, backing up to submerge newly-built homes down on the flood
plain and even older houses that survived the floods of 1973 unscathed.
The River des Peres is a drainage ditch built by President Franklin
Roosevelt's Works Progress Administration in the 1930s, but the rising
Mississippi had reversed its flow, driving it upstream. Two inches of rain
on Tuesday evening swelled it even further and swept away hundreds of yards
of sandbag levees that had held back its sewage-laden waters.
'This is much worse than 1973. It flooded right enough, but not like this,'
said Mr Mike Coric, a printer who came to the US as a refugee from Croatia
28 years ago.
Fifty yards downhill from Mr Coric's house, Hannover Street disappears into
a sullen, brown lake, its surface disturbed only by the water spilling
vainly from a handful of pumps.
A sign reading 'Sightseers get out' stands guard at the water's edge.
'Those houses down there were all built in the last 10 years. People knew
they were on the flood plain, but I guess the city ran out of land,' Mr
Coric observed.
A few miles away, Mr Don Rutledge yesterday began taking down the sandbag
wall he had built around his antiques business. After a week without
electricity, his concern now is to dry out his sodden basement, but he fears
the task will be a long one.
'Most everybody got water in their basements. When you pump it out of the
basement it goes into the sewers, and with the sewers all backed up, it just
goes back into your basement,' Mr Rutledge said.
Forecasters have had difficulty predicting when the Mississippi will crest
because the basin is so full of water. But water levels are now expected to
start falling, although the need to release water from swollen containment
reservoirs will slow the fall.
However, the weather system which has caused this year's heavy flooding
remains stubbornly static over the Midwest.
Hot moist air from the southeast continues to meet a cold front over the
Mississippi basin and the rain will not let up until this weather system has
moved along.
Federal money is expected to start flowing quickly. The House of
Representatives was due to vote yesterday on an emergency aid bill whose
total has already risen in a week from Dollars 2.48bn to Dollars 2.98bn
(Pounds 2bn), and may climb even higher before it has passed both chambers
of Congress.
Around Dollars 1.15bn of the emergency money will be directed to farmers,
with Dollars 815m more going to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
Money will also be provided to allow the Army Corps of Engineers to repair
levees, locks and dams along the river.

FT  22 JUL 93 / Meanwhile in Belgrade, only the mint works:
Sanctions-wracked economy sees inflation nearing 700% a month
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA SILBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SIGNS in Belgrade's supermarkets warn: 'Caution, prices are one thousand
times higher than marked.'
After more than two years of footing the bill for wars in neighbouring
Croatia and Bosnia and 13 months of United Nations sanctions, the Serbian
economy has reached a new low.
'Even God almighty could not help turn the economy around,' says Mr Ljubomir
Madjar, a Belgrade University economics professor.
It will get worse. However, analysts are divided over whether the Serbian
people are close to the point where they will turn against their government
and demand an end to its support for what the rest of the world regards as
Serb aggression in Bosnia.
The dinar, the Yugoslav national currency, is collapsing by the hour. The 5m
dinar note, the highest denomination, is worth about 50 German pfennings.
New denominations of 10m and 50m dinars will be issued on Monday. The D-mark
yesterday was valued at about 21m dinars for bank giro transactions.
In a speech recently to government officials, Mr Vojislav Tomic, director of
the state treasury, said: 'The country is in the most difficult situation in
its history . . . the mint is working on three shifts printing bills
non-stop, but there is still not enough cash.'
Cashiers and accountants throw up their hands in despair, hard-pressed to
keep track of the astronomical figures, often in the thousands of millions:
Inflation in June was 366.7 per cent. Economists this month estimate that
prices are rising at about 12 per cent a day, a monthly rate of 690 per
cent.
Industrial output fell by 41.9 per cent in the first five months of this
year. This followed a 21.4 per cent drop in 1992. Gross national product per
head has shrunk from Dollars 3,060 in 1989 to Dollars 350.
Serbia currently allocates 20 per cent of its shrinking GNP in aid to Serbs
in Croatia and Bosnia, although economists believe the real figure is closer
to 40 per cent.
Some 60 to 70 per cent of Serbs live below the poverty level. A typical
basket of consumer goods costs Dollars 60, but the average monthly salary is
half that, says Mr Miroljub Labus, a Belgrade University economics professor
and opposition deputy in the federal parliament.
Electricity prices have been raised 512 per cent this month alone.
More than half of Serbia's factories have temporarily closed; some
economists say the rest may shut this autumn.
The government of what remains of Yugoslavia this month minted an estimated
400,000bn dinars to purchase summer wheat. But farmers, most of whom
immediately converted sackloads of dinars into hard currency on the black
market, still lost on the transaction. Many have refused to sell their crops
as a result and there will be shortages this winter.
In Serbia's fertile northern province of Vojvodina, private bakers say they
are going on 'holiday' rather than accept the miserable government price
controls for bread.
Government-imposed controls, rather than the sanctions, appear to have given
rise to chronic shortages of flour, milk and cooking oil.
As bad as it looks, however, Serbs tend to compare themselves with their
neighbours who, in a state of war, are even worse off.
'The scenes on television of destruction and death acts as a warning not to
react in protest against the situation,' Mr Tomislav Popovic, a Belgrade
economist has said.
Serbia, under President Slobodan Milosevic, blames the mess on the
sanctions, channelling popular anger towards the west. In the
state-controlled press, sanctions are mentioned only in concert with the
word 'unjust'.
Most Serbs see the sanctions, including an oil embargo, as incomprehensible.
They believe Serbs are fighting a war of self-defence.
For example, western newspapers yesterday reported how Serb forces had
launched an offensive on Mount Igman near Sarajevo, while Serbian
state-controlled newspapers reported that the Moslems were continuing their
fierce offensive.
Meanwhile, smuggling and speculation have to some extent made up for the
emptying store shelves.
Most city dwellers appear to survive by living off their country cousins.
'People at the market simply hang around waiting for their relatives to
finish the work day. They know that their cousins, no matter how distant,
will give them what's left,' says one pensioner.
In the last few weeks, discontent has led to employees staging widespread
industrial action, including rail workers from Montenegro, air traffic
controllers from Belgrade and car workers from the giant Zastava car plant
in Kragujevac and its small arms division.
Mr Madjar says: 'The sanctions are like a time bomb. The reserves will run
out. Then the factories will stop one by one. . . .'

ABOUT 300 former Contra rebels and discharged soldiers attacked the northern
Nicaraguan city of Esteli yesterday and seized two police stations, radio
reports said, Agencies report from Managua.
One attacker was reported killed and another person wounded in the attack,
the biggest outbreak of violence since Mrs Violeta Chamorro was sworn in as
president in April 1990, ending a decade of civil war between the
US-supported Contras and Nicaragua's Sandinista government.
Radio Sandino, the broadcasting station of the Sandinista movement, said the
rebels also tried to capture the nearby towns of Ocotal, Condega and La
Trinidad, all north of Managua. It did not say if they succeeded.
Military officials were quoted on Radio Nicaragua as saying the rebels had
seized control of the city. Reports said the army, which is still under
leftist Sandinista control, had begun rushing troops to the area.

FT  22 JUL 93 / Three sides 'to attend Bosnia peace talks'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Foreign Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LEADERS of Bosnia's three warring factions have agreed to meet in Geneva for
a final round of peace talks that will begin tomorrow, Lord Owen and Mr
Thorvald Stoltenberg, the international mediators, said yesterday.
A spokesman for the mediators said they had been given 'indications' that Mr
Alija Izetbegovic, Bosnia's Moslem president, would attend along with Serb
and Croat leaders.
However, Mr Willy Claes, the European Community peace envoy, said last night
that Mr Izetbegovic stressed to him in Sarajevo yesterday that Croat forces
must allow passage of emergency relief and the Bosnian Serb advance on
Sarajevo must be halted before he could attend the talks.
Mr Claes said Mr Izetbegovic said he was ready to go to Geneva 'very soon'
but that he could not give a precise date.
The mediators' spokesman said Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader,
had given an undertaking to 'order a pause' in the advance against Bosnian
positions on Mount Igman on the outskirts of Sarajevo.
He said Mr Izetbegovic was to call a similar halt in Moslem offensives in
central Bosnia, while the Croats were to halt attacks around Mostar.
Serb forces continued to press forward earlier yesterday on Mount Igman.
'The battle for Igman is the fight for all of Bosnia,' said Bosnian radio.
Serb forces are using at least 40 tanks in their assault on Igman. The
troops are understood to be under the personal command of General Ratko
Mladic, head of Bosnian Serb forces.
If they succeeded in taking Mount Igman, they could advance up to the River
Miljacka, which runs through Sarajevo. Mr Karadzic has said the Serbs want
to divide the city along the Miljacka, the so-called green line separating
predominantly Serb districts from the rest.
Serbian and Bosnian media yesterday reported heavy clashes around Brcko,
north-eastern Bosnia.
Serb forces had also sent 31 tanks and 40 armoured vehicles around Gorazde
for their attack on the Moslem 'safe area', it said.
The radio, in what it called proof of 'ethnic cleansing' by Croats, reported
that Croat-held radio in Mostar, in the south, was broadcasting information
every hour on how Moslems could travel abroad.

FT  22 JUL 93 / Medelln seeks change of image: A look at efforts to rescue a
city from the shadow of drugs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARITA KENDALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER years of being known as the world's cocaine capital, Medelln is trying
for a change of image.
Business has joined local government and some 400 non-government
organisations to try to pull the community out of drug-related social
disintegration and violence.
Some 30,000 young people have been murdered over the last decade, according
to Medelln's former mayor, Mr Omar Florez, but tensions have eased
considerably since the last big bomb in January and there are signs that a
few factions of the neighbourhood militia groups are prepared to disarm.
Rumours of another 'imminent' surrender by trafficking chief Pablo Escobar
circulate constantly, reflecting the assumption that he has lost so much of
his support structure that he cannot evade capture indefinitely.
An anti-drug campaign has been launched with the slogan 'Medelln, world
prevention capital'. But there is so much more to Medelln than drugs, gunmen
and Escobar that the slogan does it no justice.
Located in a deep valley at the heart of the rich agricultural and mining
region of Antioquia, Medelln became Colombia's leading textile centre early
this century. Migrants flooded in from the countryside, yet somehow public
services kept pace with the poor communities stretching up dangerously steep
hillsides, and more than 95 per cent of the city's 1.8m inhabitants have
water, electricity and sewerage.
Antioquia's textile industry was thoroughly modernised during the 1980s, and
clothing is the country's top manufacturing export. Although Medelln
businessmen agree that it was essential to open up the economy, they
criticise the government's inability to control cheap, cocaine-funded
contraband and the lack of a coherent import policy - textile and tobacco
industries are having a particularly rough time, which could push
unemployment up again.
'The image of Medelln abroad is such that foreign investors don't even come
here - but we do need foreign capital to bring in new technology. The next
phase of industrial development will have to be in electronics, services.
Our regional companies have been very closed against outsiders to protect
themselves from drug trafficking money. Now we'll have to look outwards,'
says Mr Juan Guillermo Jaramillo of the ProAntioquia group.
Employment and education are usually singled out as the key factors in the
violence equation. 'Secondary school places have been increased by 10,000
but another 40,000 are still needed, as well as technical equipment,
libraries, laboratories. . . We have to provide training opportunities at
the same time so school leavers can get jobs,' says Mr Jorge Orlando Melo,
the presidency's special counsellor for Medelln. 'There have been a lot of
small-scale projects and people feel the municipality is doing something,
relations with the authorities have improved - people are animated and
involved.'
High on the mountainside above the centre, trucks grind up through the
neighbourhood of La Primavera with passengers perched on the bumpers - the
uphill fare is 250 pesos (21 pence) and the fare down only 150 pesos. A
United Nations-backed social programme aims to help this and other
substandard neighbourhoods by strengthening community organisations,
improving housing and consolidating infrastructure, especially schools,
recreation facilities and roads.
The densely packed small brick houses have to be shored up with stone walls
because of geological instability. In 1987 more than 400 people were killed
in a mud avalanche a few hundred metres from La Primavera.
Many of the city's hillside communities are reached by stairways rather than
streets, and rubbish-filled gullies complicate communications.
Great hopes are fixed on the Metro, which, after long delays and financing
hiccups, is due to start operating in 1995. It is forcing a re-think of
Medelln's transport system, as well as creating openings for land use
changes and new developments around stations.
In the meantime, though, street sellers, thieves and rubbish recyclers mill
under elevated sections in the city centre and buses clog the streets.
Medelln had one of the first development plans in the continent and the
local administration is considered unusually efficient and honest. In order
to decentralise and encourage community participation, the municipal
government is building up a network of subcentres where services and taxes
can be paid, documents processed and legal advice sought.
Industry has already begun to decentralise and the Metro will speed the
process by pushing up land values along the central corridor. New plants and
flower farms have sprouted in the upland valley near the airport but one of
the city's limitations is its poor road connections to Bogota and the
Atlantic and Pacific ports.
Some Antioquenos joke that cocaine trafficking is just another aspect of the
region's much-vaunted pioneering spirit and money ethic. Others, such as Mr
Jaramillo, recognise that a crisis had been looming for some time, and drug
trafficking was simply the 'detonator'.
Although the economy of Antioquia grew faster than the national average last
year, three top export earners - coffee, bananas and gold - are seriously
affected by world price and quota problems. Medelln's industry is also
highly concentrated and unemployment cycles tend to be relatively deep and
stubborn.
But Mr Jaramillo undoubtedly reflects regional spunk when he says: 'We're
not resigned here - new paths are always opening up.'

FT  22 JUL 93 / Action on US urban aid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Clinton administration yesterday sent its community banking proposals to
Congress, asking lawmakers for Dollars 382m (Pounds 254.6m) funding over the
next four years.
The proposed Community Development Banking and Financing Institutions Fund
is the administration's main programme for urban and rural aid.
Mr Lloyd Bentsen, Treasury secretary, told the House banking committee
'distressed' communities needed a sustained and comprehensive financing
mechanism to gain entry into 'mainstream America' in a manner 'devoid of
long-term subsidy'.
The fund will lend money to community development financial institutions,
such as credit unions and neighbourhood banks, most of which must provide
matching money. It may lend up to Dollars 5m per application to any insured
local financing group, and up to Dollars 2m for uninsured institutions.
Assistance from the fund may be used to develop or support commercial and
community facilities that produce jobs; create or expand businesses; provide
basic financial services to poor people; provide mortgage aid to the poor;
and finance low-income housing. It may also provide technical assistance
grants.
Congressman Henry Gonzalez, chairman of the committee, said that although
the proposal was 'a step in the right direction. . . it is not the elixir
for our nation's dying communities.' He said many areas could not even
absorb credit because they had so many unemployed and so few jobs.
'Enacting this bill does not excuse the federal government from implementing
a more comprehensive urban policy that addresses the lack of housing, health
care, educational and economic opportunities and the prevalence of crime,
drugs and violence,' he said.
The American Bankers Association also saw the funding request as only 'a
good starting point'. It wants commercial banks brought into the programme
to provide 'a huge pool of capital for community development'.
As the administration's proposal now stands, only institutions 'principally
engaged' in community development lending would qualify.

FT  22 JUL 93 / FTC fails to reach anti-trust decision on Microsoft
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US Federal Trade Commission failed for a second time yesterday to reach
a conclusive decision on whether to bring an anti-trust action against
Microsoft, the world's largest personal computer software company.
The FTC's three-year anti-trust inquiry remains open, although the
commission yesterday voted down a staff recommendation to file a complaint
against Microsoft. This follows an earlier vote in February, when the
commission was deadlocked over whether to take action.
The case stems from a battle between Microsoft and its competitors in the
software industry, who allege that Microsoft has used anti-competitive
tactics to achieve its dominant role in the market. Microsoft holds a 98 per
cent share of the world market for personal computer operating systems that
run on IBM-compatible PCs, and is the market leader in several other
segments of the PC software market.
The FTC, which conducts proceedings in private, concluded its meeting in
Washington without comment. Microsoft, however, said the company had been
informed the FTC had voted not to issue an administrative complaint,
although it added it was given 'no further indication from the FTC as to the
status of the non-public investigation of the company'.
However, Novell, Microsoft's largest competitor in the PC software market,
disputed Microsoft's statement. 'The commission deadlocked (with two vote
for and two against) on whether to file suit against Microsoft, and in a
second vote deadlocked on whether to close the case,' said Mr David
Bradford, senior vice-president and general counsel for Novell.
'The commission voted on whether to issue a complaint against Microsoft and
the motion failed,' countered Mr William Neukom , Microsoft vice-president
of law. 'That is an important and positive development for Microsoft.'
The company has been under investigation by the FTC since June 1990.
Throughout, it has denied any wrongdoing and said that it was continuing to
co-operate with the commission.
It is conceivable, Mr Neukom said, that the FTC staff could bring the case
before the commission again. 'But they have already had two bites at us. It
would be highly unusual for them to try again.'
Novell, however, called on the US Justice Department to take up the case.
Such a transfer would be unusual, but not unprecedented, said Ms Wendy
Goldman Rohm, author of a soon-to-be-published book on the Microsoft
anti-trust investigation. 'The two agencies have procedures in place to
exchange documents for law enforcement purposes. I expect the FTC to receive
a request from the Justice Department for key documents from the Microsoft
case within 30 days.'
Mr Neukom said Microsoft had maintained from the beginning 'that it competes
in an honest and ethical manner and has not violated the anti-trust laws.'

mechanism to gain entry into 'mainstream America' in a manner 'devoid of
long-term subsidy'.
The fund will lend money to community development financial institutions,
such as credit unions and neighbourhood banks, most of which must provide
matching money. It may lend up to Dollars 5m per application to any insured
local financing group, and up to Dollars 2m for uninsured institutions.
Assistance from the fund may be used to develop or support commercial and
community facilities that produce jobs; create or expand businesses; provide
basic financial services to poor people; provide mortgage aid to the poor;
and finance low-income housing. It may also provide technical assistance
grants.
Congressman Henry Gonzalez, chairman of the committee, said that although
the proposal was 'a step in the right direction. . . it is not the elixir
for our nation's dying communities.' He said many areas could not even
absorb credit because they had so many unemployed and so few jobs.
'Enacting this bill does not excuse the federal government from implementing
a more comprehensive urban policy that addresses the lack of housing, health
care, educational and economic opportunities and the prevalence of crime,
drugs and violence,' he said.
The American Bankers Association also saw the funding request as only 'a
good starting point'. It wants commercial banks brought into the programme
to provide 'a huge pool of capital for community development'.
As the administration's proposal now stands, only institutions 'principally
engaged' in community development lending would qualify.
Mr William Brandon Jr, president of the association, said banks, which can
muster vast financial and human resources, ought to be brought into the
scheme. 'Every dollar of capital can support Dollars 8 to Dollars 12 in new
loans,' he said.

FT  22 JUL 93 / Clinton aide in apparent suicide
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton has lost a friend and political ally with the death
of Mr Vincent Foster Jr, who apparently took his own life six months after
coming to Washington from Arkansas to work as deputy counsel in the White
House.
Administration officials were stunned by the death of Mr Foster, who was
found shot dead in a McLean, Virginia, park.
The only immediate explanation offered was depression over the barrage of
negative publicity surrounding the firing of seven employees from the White
House travel office on charges of mismanagement.
In the fall-out, the White House stood accused of a wide range of political
misdemeanours including cronyism, abuse of power and an attempt to misuse
the FBI. The counsel's office was criticised for failing to contain the
incident. Mr Foster kept Mrs Hillary Rodham Clinton informed about the
alleged mismanagement of the travel office.
Ms Clinton and Mr Foster had been partners at the Rose law firm in Little
Rock, Arkansas, before Mr Clinton's election. His death is a reminder that
in many administrations, people come to Washington with high hopes and leave
frustrated after the exposure to the national media and the close scrutiny
that come with serving the president.

FT  22 JUL 93 / Riot report raps Dinkins
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE chances of Mr David Dinkins gaining re-election as mayor of New York
this autumn have been hit by the publication of a report which strongly
criticises his handling of four days of violent disturbances in the city in
1991.
The report was drawn up for New York's Democratic Governor Mario Cuomo. It
blames Mr Dinkins, also a Democrat, for failing to act decisively enough to
prevent disturbances in the Crown Heights area of Brooklyn from escalating
into four days of violent confrontation between blacks and Jews. The report
calls it 'the most extensive racial unrest in New York City in over 20
years'.
The report will provide ammunition for Mr Rudolph Giuliani, the Republican
candidate in the November 2 election, who lost the 1989 race to Mr Dinkins
by only 2 percentage points.
Crown Heights is a touchstone for two of the most important issues:
allegations that Mr Dinkins is an indecisive leader, and the need for the
city's mayor to ameliorate New York's perpetual racial tensions.
Mr Dinkins won the 1989 poll with an estimated 35 per cent of Jewish votes,
and the report could erode his standing among this important electoral bloc.
His support among Hispanics may also have been weakened by the decision in
May of Mr Herman Badillo, the community's Democratic elder statesman, to
join the Giuliani ticket and run as the city's financial comptroller.
The Crown Heights trouble was sparked off when an car driven by a Hasidic
Jew went out of control and killed a seven-year-old black child. In the
ensuing disturbances, a Hasidic scholar was engulfed by a black mob and
stabbed to death.
The report, overseen by the state's director of criminal justice, Mr Richard
Girgenti, rejects allegations that Mr Dinkins had instructed police to let
black youths 'vent' their anger after the child's death.
But it found the mayor slow to appreciate the scale of the violence taking
place in Crown Heights, a lack of effective co-ordination in the City Hall
command structure, and a 'leadership vacuum' at the highest level of the
police department.

FT  22 JUL 93 / Pounds 8.5m spent searching for Escobar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARITA KENDALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A year after his escape from jail, drugs cartel leader Mr Pablo Escobar is
still on the loose, probably hidden by loyal followers in the Medelln area.
The government has spent over Pounds 8.5m hunting for him and his henchmen,
making 12,000 raids and searches and arresting 1,400 people, Sarita Kendall
writes.
A newly fortified jail houses 25 of the most wanted gunmen and traffickers
captured or re-captured over the last year. On several occasions Mr Escobar
has apparently been close to surrendering. For nine months he responded to
the chase by planting massive car bombs in Bogota and Medelln. But the
police claim to have broken up the bombing groups and have seized seven
tonnes of dynamite as well as hundreds of weapons.
Heads have rolled for his escape - four generals, three colonels, 11 other
officers, 36 guards and soldiers and the former vice minister of justice
have all been charged in connection with the breakout.
But as President Cesar Gaviria comes up to the last year of his presidency,
Mr Escobar's escape and continued liberty remains the biggest embarrassment
of his administration.

FT  22 JUL 93 / Bundesbank target is broken again
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CONFLICTING signals emerged yesterday over the course of German monetary
policy when money supply exceeded the target range set by the Bundesbank for
the third month in a row.
Hopes that the central bank would be able to speed up its phased reduction
of interest rates were raised earlier in the day when the Bundesbank made a
deeper than expected cut in the minimum money-market securities repurchase
rate.
According to provisional figures released yesterday by the Bundesbank, the
M3 broad money measure climbed at an annualised, seasonally adjusted rate of
7.1 per cent in June.
On Tuesday night Mr Johann Gaddum, a member of the Bundesbank's directorate,
had said that the money supply target range of 3.5-5.5 per cent growth was
attainable, but conceded that progress towards the goal was not 'over the
hill'.
Coming after 6.9 per cent growth in May, yesterday's figure was both a
surprise and a disappointment for economists who had hoped for a lower
figure, perhaps within the 4.5-6.5 per cent target range.
The poor figures, reflecting growth in public sector borrowing, led
economists to predict that the Bundesbank would not move to cut headline
interest rates at next Thursday's meeting of the policy-making council, the
last time the council meets again before September.
Earlier in the day, however, the Bundesbank made a deeper than expected cut
in the repo rate, the rate at which the Bundesbank provides wholesale funds
for the market. It fell to 7.15 per cent, down from 7.28 per cent last week.
This was better than traders' expectations of a fall to 7.18-7.20 per cent
and brings the repo rate closer to the floor set by the discount rate,
currently at 6.75 per cent after being reduced by half a percentage point at
the beginning of July.
The latest Bundesbank monthly report said that a brightening of the monetary
environment was one reason for the generous cuts in the discount and Lombard
rate on July 1.
Talk of another July rate cut was sparked earlier this month by speculative
pressure on the French franc and Danish krona in the exchange rate mechanism
of the EMS.
But the speculative pressures have since abated, shifting the markets' focus
back to Germany's domestic monetary goals. 'With M3 running at such a high
level it will be difficult for the Bundesbank to justify any further cuts,'
said Mr Hermann Remsperger, chief economist at the BHF-Bank yesterday. The
figures showed that lending to businesses and private individuals rose at a
seasonally-adjusted annualised rate of 7.5 per cent in the first half of
year.
'The chance of another rate cut is virtually zero now,' said Mr Klaus
Baader, UBS Phillips &amp; Drew economist in London.
The Federation of German Banks said that a further rate cut would encourage
economic growth in Germany, which is mired in recession, but it said the
central bank had to move carefully because of stubbornly high inflation and
the need to maintain confidence in the D-Mark. German bankers are concerned
that if rate cuts came too rapidly the D-Mark would come under pressure.
A central factor behind the unexpected increase in M3 was a rise in foreign
currency assets of the banking sector.
The reason for this puzzled economists, but Ms Alison Cottrell of Midland
Global Markets Research in London said it probably reflected the effects of
the Bundesbank's previous currency market intervention.
Meanwhile, the next provisional inflation figures are likely to show
consumer prices rising at 4.3 per cent, up from 4.2 per cent in June and
more than twice the Bundesbank's long-term target of 2 per cent.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE uncomfortably high German money supply figure added to concerns over the
prospects for the French franc yesterday, writes Peter John in London.
Economists feared that if Germany does not ease monetary policy soon France
will have to raise rates to support its currency, a possibility that had
been dismissed until yesterday. 'Tensions within the ERM mean that Germany
is obliged to pursue a monetary policy which is easier than is fully
appropriate under domestic inflationary conditions,' said Mr Thomas Mayer at
Goldman Sachs in Frankfurt yesterday. He pointed out that France is obliged
to keep interest rates higher than the fundamentals require.
The franc was marginally firmer at Ffr3.41.50 against the D-Mark, just over
1.5 centimes above its ERM floor. However, French government bond futures
went through a key support level to close more than half a percentage point
lower.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The emergence of Mr Edouard Balladur as a possible contender for the
presidency appears to be playing on the nerves of his patron and party
leader, Mr Jacques Chirac, who has rebuked the prime minister for not
marking a sharper policy 'rupture' with the preceding Socialist government,
writes David Buchan in Paris.
A report by the Liberation newspaper that Mr Chirac used a lunchtime meeting
on Monday with coalition leaders to chide Mr Balladur for not pursuing
distinctive polices on the economy, education and defence was yesterday
confirmed by some of the participants.
Mr Chirac, who stayed out of the government to remain free to run for the
presidency in 1995, seems to have been irked at Mr Balladur's failure to
curb rising unemployment, at his acquiescence in President Mitterrand's
decision to defer parliamentary consideration of private school funding, and
at the prime minister's agreement with the Socialist president that France
should continue its suspension of nuclear tests.

Mr Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation is likely to be a leading applicant to
run Poland's first commercial national television network, writes
Christopher Bobinski in Warsaw.
The company is considering applying jointly with the Polish Investment
Consortium, set up this week, which comprises local banks, privatised
companies and wealthy businessmen.
Under Polish legislation foreigners are limited to a 33 per cent share in
broadcasting companies. The Bertelsman Corporation from Germany as well as
Mr Silvio Berlusconi from Italy have also shown interest.
At the moment state-run television has two channels. A recently established
independent Radio and TV Council will consider applications in the autumn
for the licence to run the third private channel.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEGOTIATIONS between Poland and its London Commercial Club creditors for a
reduction in Warsaw's Dollars 12.1bn bank debt were suspended indefinitely
yesterday,
The Polish side rejected the banks' proposals as 'not acceptable'. Mr
Krzysztof Krowacki, the chief negotiator, said: 'We did not expect such a
tough approach. The banks have been sending out signals that we would be
offered something serious. That is apparently not so.'
Poland is seeking an agreement for a reduction of its 1 debt to more than
300 commercial banks similar to the two-stage, 50 per cent debt reduction
agreed with the Paris Club on Dollars 33bn of official debt in April 1991.
In May Poland and the banks agreed to enter negotiations on the basis of
three principles which linked an eventual debt reduction agreement to
Poland's capacity to pay and its existing agreement with the Paris Club.
Mr Krowacki, who is being advised by Kidder Peabody, the US merchant bank
and the US law firm, White &amp; Case, said: 'If the banks come up with a
proposal in line with the three principles or are prepared to discuss our
proposals, we would return to the table immediately. But there are no plans
for this at present.'
No comment was available from the banks last night.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE insider dealing commission of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange yesterday
pointedly failed to clear Mr Franz Steinkuhler, the former union leader, of
insider dealing in the shares of a Daimler-Benz holding company.
Without naming the former head of IG Metall, Germany's powerful engineering
union, the commission said it had been unable to pursue one individual who
had made self-incriminating remarks because that person had not signed the
voluntary code under which insider dealing is regulated in Germany.
The commission said that under current laws it had no powers to pursue
further the individual, who is understood to be Mr Steinkuhler. He bought
nearly DM1m (Pounds 300,000) of shares in Mercedes Holding (MAH), the bulk
the day before an announcement on April 2 which led to a sharp rise in the
price of MAH shares. The shares had risen before the announcement. At the
time Mr Steinkuhler was on the supervisory board of Daimler-Benz.
It is understood that Mr Steinkuhler did not accept the anti-insider code
retrospectively as some people have done in order to allow the commission to
complete its enquiries. Mr Steinkuhler denied dealing on the basis of inside
knowledge gleaned from his position on the board, but he resigned from the
Daimler board as well as his union position.
The commission said yesterday that it could be assumed that the rise in the
MAH share price prior to the announcement on April 2 was not caused by
people trading on the basis of inside knowledge.

FT  22 JUL 93 / GM-VW inquiry statement due

<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRESH light is expected to be shed on the industrial espionage battle
between General Motors and Volkswagen later today when criminal
investigators are due to issue their first formal statement since they
started the search for evidence in late April.
The Darmstadt state prosecutor's office, which took up the investigation at
GM's request after Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua defected from GM to VW
in March, said its statement would cover progress so far.
Most interest is focused on recent finds, especially four boxes discovered
on July 12 in a Wiesbaden apartment previously occupied by two of Mr Lopez's
colleagues. The duo quit GM's German subsidiary, Adam Opel, shortly after Mr
Lopez was appointed production and procurement director at VW. The cartons
are known to have contained details of a secret new car model, but it is
understood that further confidential information was also discovered.
Mr Lopez and his associates, backed by VW and the group's supervisory board,
have consistently denied that they took or delivered any secrets to VW.
The state prosecutors, who launched their probe after GM established grounds
for suspicion of industrial spying by presenting affidavits from its
employees, have already interviewed more than 30 employees of the US-based
automotive group.
VW staff have also been called in, but it is understood that Mr Lopez and
his associates who joined him at VW when he quit General Motors, have yet to
be interviewed.
Mr Lopez and Mr Jose Manuel Gutierrez, his closest aide at GM and now at VW,
are believed to be on holiday. Personal testimony and affidavits from GM
staff played a key role in a Hamburg court ruling earlier this week in which
VW failed to prevent Der Spiegel news magazine from continuing to publish
allegations of industrial espionage against VW and its employees.
Opel said yesterday that if VW pressed on with a full court hearing to try
to reimpose a gag on Der Spiegel, it expected its employees would be
prepared to appear again to support the magazine's case.
Volkswagen confirmed that it was considering restarting legal proceedings
after this week's setback, but it wanted to see the court's reasoned opinion
on the rulings first. According to VW, it could be several weeks before the
written opinion is ready.

<TEXT>
THE Italian government has begun an inquiry into whether Milan magistrates
had behaved correctly in denying Mr Cagliari bail on five occasions and
keeping him in prison for 133 days, writes Robert Graham.
Mr Cagliari was found dead in his Milan prison cell on Tuesday. An autopsy
carried out yesterday confirmed he had committed suicide.
A formal announcement on the cause of death must wait 60 days; but officials
said after the brief autopsy carried out in the presence of one of the Milan
magistrates that Mr Cagliari had taken his life. The Milan magistrates
themselves, clearly shaken by the suicide, were reported to be keen to have
the inquiry - convinced they will be vindicated. This was the ninth suicide
among those under investigation in the nationwide corruptions scandals.
Mr Cagliari had been arrested on March 9 on charges of corruption,
falsifying accounts and illicit financing of political parties and two other
sets of similar charges were subsequently pressed relating to ENI. He
admitted ENI had been used for illicit funding of political parties but
refused to incriminate friends and colleagues. Press comment yesterday
highlighted Mr Cagliari's suicide as a gesture of protest. 'It is appalling
that in a civilised country one chooses to speak out using such a gesture,'
commented La Stampa. Suicide in prison, the paper said, is a terrible
gesture when it derives 'not from desperation but a rational decision'.

FT  22 JUL 93 / Swedish companies look overseas for salvation: Gustavsberg's
response to recession at home and internationally-high production costs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE name Gustavsberg may not have the international resonance of Volvo,
Electrolux or Ericsson, but within Sweden it has been a leading brand name
for more than 150 years. It is a rare Swede who has not drunk from coffee
cups adorned with its anchor symbol, washed in its basins and baths - or sat
on a Gustavsberg loo.
The company is not just famous for its products; it has a long history on
the forested island of Varmdo, off Stockholm, and is noted for its very
Swedish tradition of looking after its workers.
But as with much else in Sweden's struggling economy, things have changed
radically at Gustavsberg as the young chief executive battles to keep the
company competitive.
Like many medium to large Swedish companies it increasingly finds that the
joint pressures of recession at home and internationally-high production
costs force it to cut domestic production and look overseas for survival.
Mr Lennart Evrell, chief executive at Gustavsberg, explains the strategy:
'Since 1990 we have sold and left different business areas in Scandinavia
where we thought we were not going to be able to keep an
internationally-competitive position. Then we have acquired companies
outside Sweden in areas in which we want to be.'
The result at Gustavsberg has been a transformation of the company's
traditional profile as a domestically-oriented producer. The process began
in the late 1980s with the shedding of a number of companies to establish a
core of four divisions - pipes, taps, sanitary ware and baths and showers.
Among the units sold off in 1987 was the china tableware factory that dated
back to 1825 and which symbolised Gustavsberg to many people. It is now
owned by a Finnish company which will end all production on Varmdo this
year.
In 1990 Gustavsberg made a strategic leap by buying Koralle, a German
manufacturer of shower cubicles, making it Europe's second biggest shower
box maker.
But recovery was still far off, prompting KF, the big co-operative
conglomerate which owns Gustavsberg, to bring in Mr Evrell from the
engineering group Atlas Copco.
He has pushed on with the restructuring. He has closed Gustavsberg's factory
making pipe lengths - no advantage of scale for a Swedish producer - and
concentrated on joints and bends where more added value can be achieved. A
plant making steel baths has shut with production shifted to a German
associate - a decision made more expensive by the devaluation of the Swedish
krona last autumn, but one which still makes long-term sense, Mr Evrell
insists.
The result has been dramatic. Overall sales have dipped only marginally to
SKr1.35bn (Pounds 113.4m) last year. But operating profit in the first four
months of 1993 reached SKr23m, compared with SKr2.2m in the whole of 1991.
Most striking of all, two thirds of sales are now outside Sweden, compared
with just one third in 1990. Where once there were around 2,000 employees in
Sweden, there are now only 600, out of the total group workforce of 1,300.
Out of 20 companies in the Gustavsberg group, 13 are outside Sweden.
Mr Evrell intends to continue the trend and he says it is one that most
Swedish companies are following. He stresses, too, that a company like
Gustavsberg does not solve its problems by shifting abroad. With Europe in
recession, the danger is that a company buys itself on to a higher profits
base - but one where the line is still pointing down.
Sweden is looking next year to exports - or internationally-based companies
 -to restore some growth to the economy. But the example of Gustavsberg
suggests that it will be slow going - and that it will do little to help
bring about a turnround in unemployment at home.

FT  22 JUL 93 / Suicide note castigates Milan magistrates' methods: 'I can
no longer bear this disgrace. We are trested like dogs in kennels' -
Gabriele Cagliari
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Extracts of the letter written by Gabriele Cagliari, former ENI chairman, to
his family before committing suicide on July 20. The messages to his wife
and children have been omitted.
ONCE more I am about to cause great grief. After intense thought, I have
decided I can no longer bear this disgrace.
Ways of behaviour common to almost everybody - including the very same
magistrates, even those in Milan - have become criminal.
Some of us have been caught and exposed to public pillory and anger. The
heavy hand of the law, unbalanced and unjust, has done the rest. We are
treated like non-persons, like dogs in kennels.
I have been here for over four months, illegally detained. There is no risk
of me repeating anything I am accused of; nor is there any risk of me
tampering with evidence relating to these accusations since I possess no
powers of decision or action, neither am I going to alter any document since
I have none.
As for me leaving the country, I have no passport or identity card. On top
of this I am 67 years old and the law lays down that to be kept in such
degrading conditions there have to be exceptional circumstances.
But as you are aware the motives for this pitiless treatment are different
and the magistrates themselves repeatedly say so, even though this never is
placed on the formal record (of the interrogations) as it should be.
The magistrates' aim, and in particular those in Milan, is to force each one
of us to make an irrevocable break with what they call our 'world' (the
corrupt politico-economic system).
Each one of us, already compromised in the public eye for being under
investigation - or worse still arrested - is expected to 'collaborate'. Such
'collaboration' involves betrayals and denunciations and one ends up as they
want you being classed as an 'outcast'.
I am convinced the magistrates regard prison as no more than a tool of the
trade for psychological torture, regardless of peoples' lives being at
stake.
As I have said we are like dogs in a kennel, and any public prosecutor can
pick on us to show off to his colleagues that he can be tougher and smarter
than the person who did the same thing a few days ago or a few hours back.
Even among them there are the same market forces of competition - with the
difference that in this case they are playing with other people's skins.
In these circumstances I cannot accept any justice they hand out to me. They
are destroying the very base of the rule of law and are moving on a path
that leads towards authoritarianism.
I want no part of this.
Today the trials - and not only those in Milan - are tragic farces, with
disproportionate sentences handed out by judges who scarce know the cases or
who have fallen asleep during the sessions and then make up their minds in
five minutes behind closed doors.
The few of us who have fallen into the hands of this system of 'justice'
risk becoming the scapegoats in the national tragedy being created by this
revolution.
I am convinced however I must reject such a scapegoat role.
I feel above all else a husband and father, then a committed and honest
worker who has sought to enhance a little our name: someone who has
contributed his tiny part in advancing the cause of this country in the
world. I won't let this be sullied by anyone involved in the 'clean hands'
(corruption enquiry). I ask this of you as I seek your forgiveness for this
farewell that is final.

FT  22 JUL 93 / Fears for image of German industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PUBLIC confidence in the leadership of Volkswagen is ebbing as Germany's
most influential newspapers begin to consider that General Motors' claims of
industrial espionage might, after all, be more than a 'campaign' against its
main German rival.
Nothing had yet been proved and nothing had been decided, said the
Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ) yesterday. However, it commented,
Tuesday's ruling by a Hamburg civil court that Der Spiegel, the news weekly,
could continue reporting on the most damaging allegations, had 'cast a clear
shadow' over VW. The suspicions were still only suspicions, but they were
gaining weight, according to the FAZ said.
The paper noted recent remarks by Mr Klaus Liesen, chairman of the VW
supervisory board, that the affair was a campaign by Adam Opel, GM's German
subsidiary, which damaged the whole automobile industry. However, it said:
'Above all it is damaging VW during a delicate restructuring phase.' The
need for explanations was increasing. 'If the suspicions harden, then the
situation will become especially tight for (VW) chairman Ferdinand Piech,
who is linked for better or worse with Lopez.' Tuesday's court ruling
indicated that the judge set more store on affidavits and testimony from GM
employees than on statements from Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua,
Volkswagen's new production director, and Mr Piech.
The weekly Die Zeit newspaper was more direct. It asked if Mr Lopez could be
taken seriously when he spoke with a 'forked tongue' over a mooted car
factory in his Basque homeland.
His accounts varied depending on whether he was speaking in Spain or
Germany, Die Zeit said.
If the allegations hardened that Mr Lopez had stolen secret GM documents,
the VW supervisory board would have no choice but to fire him immediately,
the paper added. If that did not take VW's name out of the headlines: 'Then
it will be a matter of the head of Piech, who is not good at acting as
though he knows nothing.'
Until yesterday the quality press, apart from Der Spiegel which has printed
dozens of allegations against Mr Lopez and his associates, had reported
developments in the affair in dead-pan fashion, in barest detail, and
virtually without comment, apart from the occasional use of the word
'unique'.
'The dimensions of the case are not conceivable to them (editors),'
explained one German observer. 'They cannot imagine that a company at the
top of German industry could be involved in such an affair.'
At the same time, there was a general feeling that Germany had enough
economic and unemployment problems without the press undermining or damaging
a company as important as Volkswagen, he added.
Yesterday even Bild Zeitung, the mass circulation daily, which has in the
past concentrated mainly on the curiosity value of Mr Lopez, his eating
habits and management methods, reflected the changed mood.
'Is Lopez on the way out?' asked the headline on its front-page report on
the Der Spiegel ruling.

FT  22 JUL 93 / Nadir puts case with dossier of court transcripts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By AGENCIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FUGITIVE businessman Mr Asil Nadir last night released a 60-page dossier of
documents, court transcripts and letters in an effort to prove his view that
he would not get a fair trial in Britain, agencies report.
Hundreds of copies of the dossier were sent to politicians, church leaders
and news organisations. Much of the contents refers to court hearings
subject to a contempt of court order and cannot be published.
Claims in the dossier refer to allegations made by Mr Michael Mates, the
former Northern Ireland minister, in the Commons that the prosecuting
authorities tried to bring pressure on the trial judge, Mr Justice Tucker.
Mr Nadir, the former chairman of the collapsed Polly Peck conglomerate, fled
to northern Cyprus in May while awaiting trial on 13 charges of theft and
false accounting.
The SFO said last night: 'There's nothing new about these court documents.
They have been circulating for some time. We were in court and we do not
need to look at them.'
The dossier's introduction says its purpose is to reveal for the first time
what happened behind 'closed courtroom doors'.
Its aim is 'to bring to the attention of politicians, opinion-formers in the
media and churchmen and libertarians, the fabrications and distortions' in
the lead-up to the trial.
Mr Nadir says in a letter accompanying the dossier that he was not intending
to show contempt for British law. 'I left the country because I did not see
why, if found guilty as a result of the constant tampering with my trial, I
should then languish in jail for years . . . until someone decided to take
up my case and proved my innocence.'
'I doubt very much that 'Free the Belgravia One' would strike a chord with
the sympathies of the British people, however great the miscarriage of
justice.
'It became increasingly evident that the behaviour of the prosecution
amounted to a miscarriage of justice in the making,' he adds.

FT  22 JUL 93 / Bankers brush aside fears over derivatives market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE and TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A GROUP of the world's top bankers has brushed aside fears that the Dollars
4,000bn (Pounds 2,600bn) derivatives market threatens the international
banking system.
The Group of Thirty, a Washington-based think-tank chaired by Mr Paul
Volcker, former head of the US Federal Reserve, concludes in a report
published yesterday that no new regulations are required. However, it says
market participants should implement stricter internal controls.
The long-awaited recommendations on these sophisticated financial
instruments contrast sharply with concerns voiced recently by Mr William
McDonough, new chairman of the New York Fed, and with warnings last year by
his predecessor, Mr Gerald Corrigan, that the market might be running out of
control.
Derivatives are instruments, such as futures, options and swaps, whose value
is based on an underlying cash market in stocks, currencies, interest rates
or commodities.
To their supporters, they have brought greater flexibility to the management
of financial risks of companies, investors, government agencies and others.
To their critics, they have created complex risks that few users and traders
know how to handle.
The G30 concedes the instruments are complicated but rules out fresh
regulatory initiatives. It calls for a deeper understanding of derivatives
and says senior management should closely monitor the use of such
instruments. It argues that risk is diminished if users observe strict
internal controls.
Mr Volcker, in a foreword to the report, says: 'The critically important
contribution of this study has been to define a set of sound risk management
practices for dealers and end users.' The G30 report concurs with recent
reviews of derivatives by the Bank of England and the Bank for International
Settlements.
A Bank of England official said the G30 report seemed 'in keeping' with its
own derivatives report issued in April.
Many of the group's findings - that public disclosure of derivatives
exposures is inadequate; that wider acceptance of multi-product netting
agreements is needed; and that accounting practices for derivatives must be
standardised - are not new.
The report sidesteps the controversial issue of capital adequacy that
underlies the unease about derivatives trading.
Sir Dennis Weatherstone, chairman of investment bank JP Morgan and leader of
the G30 study group on derivatives, said the main problem facing the
derivatives industry had been a lack of understanding.
'We have made substantial progress in this area,' said Sir Dennis.

FT  22 JUL 93 / Major in last plea to Maastricht rebels: Speaker tells
courts not to interfere with rights of Commons over treaty
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR will today stake his political authority on a last-ditch plea
to Conservative Eurosceptics to end the party's year-long civil war over
Maastricht by voting against the treaty's social chapter.
But last night the outcome of today's crucial House of Commons debate on the
treaty remained uncertain, with both sides claiming enough votes to ensure
victory when MPs troop into the Commons lobbies at 10pm.
The tortuous ratification process also took another extraordinary twist when
Miss Betty Boothroyd, the Speaker of the House of Commons, delivered a sharp
warning to the courts not to interfere in the proceedings of the House.
In a statement in response to representations from Labour MP Mr Tony Benn
about the court action against Maastricht ratification launched by Lord
Rees-Mogg, she strongly defended the sovereignty of parliament. Citing the
1689 Glorious Revolution's Bill of Rights, she said she took 'with great
seriousness' any questioning in the courts of proceedings in the Commons.
Her comments strengthened expectations at Westminster that the courts are
likely to throw out the challenge which begins in the High Court next week.
As party managers counted pledges, the bald arithmetic appeared still to
point to a government defeat in the Commons vote. Underlining the expected
closeness of the vote, Mr Major last night met potential Tory rebels
individually to persuade them to fall into line.
About a dozen Tory Eurosceptics said they were committed to join the Labour
and Liberal Democrat parties in voting for an opposition amendment which
would prevent ratification unless and until the government accepted the
social chapter. Up to a dozen more said they planned to abstain rather than
support the government in the hope that a Labour victory would derail the
ratification process.
Those figures suggested that unless he makes a deal to win the support of
the nine Ulster Unionists before tonight's vote, Mr Major's majority of 18
will be wiped out.
But speculation that the government would do such a deal intensified last
night when Mr Major raised the possibility of negotiating a successor to the
Anglo-Irish agreement.
Senior ministers also took comfort from a handful of defections from the
Eurosceptic camp, suggesting that, as on a previous occasion last autumn,
the rebellion might crumble in the final hours before the vote.
The best that more dispassionate Westminster insiders could offer was a
'hunch' that Mr Major would scrape through, drawing a line under the most
bitter battle in modern parliamentary history.
That impression was reinforced by a public display of studied calm among
Tory party managers and ministers, suggesting that they are confident of
victory. But ministers warned that the government would press ahead with
ratification even if defeated.
Mr Major will open today's debate with a warning that the imposition in
Britain of the social chapter would wreck hopes of an economic recovery. He
will follow that with a plea for loyalty at a private meeting of the
backbench 1922 committee just hours before the Commons vote.

FT  22 JUL 93 / Clarke hails 'all-round' upturn: Chancellor renews warning
that tax rises may be needed to cut deficit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN and EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN is experiencing an 'all-round recovery' that was 'good and balanced
so far', Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, said yesterday as new figures
confirmed rising business activity in Britain's high streets and a narrowing
trade gap.
But Mr Clarke warned that growth this year would not suffice to cut the
budget deficit as much as needed.
He said that 'further government action' might be necessary in another
indication that the government is considering raising taxes while limiting
public expenditure in its first unified Budget in November.
In a two-hour session before the Commons Treasury and Civil Service
committee, Mr Clarke said the size of the deficit - estimated by the
Treasury in March at Pounds 50bn in 1993-94 - was 'the biggest single thing'
that he had to tackle.
Unless the deficit was reduced, recovery would be constrained and it might
be difficult to keep interest rates down, he said.
The chancellor disclosed that the Budget would be on November 30, but told
the committee he had not yet started to think about its specific contents.
However, he did say the Conservative party preferred to have indirect
taxation take a bigger share of the tax burden than direct taxes.
Mr Clarke was careful not to sound euphoric about Britain's present economic
performance, at one point describing the recovery as 'incipient'. But his
testimony to the committee, just two months after he moved into Number 11
Downing Street, came at the end of a fortnight of favourable economic
indicators and shortly before provisional figures tomorrow are expected to
show good growth in gross domestic product in the second quarter.
Figures yesterday showing a surprisingly strong jump in retail sales and
strong export growth added to evidence that the UK recovery is not as
vulnerable as initially expected. Seasonally adjusted retail sales volumes
rose 1.3 per cent in June for a 3.9 per cent increase on the corresponding
month last year, the Central Statistical Office reported.
Other official figures showed that the value of exports to countries outside
the European Community jumped to their highest ever levels last month,
reducing the non-EC trade deficit to Pounds 613m, its narrowest since July
1991.
The figures added to sterling's recent strength, with the pound closing in
London  3/4 of a pfennig higher against the D-Mark at DM2.5725. Against the
dollar it was just over a cent higher at Dollars 1.5145, with little change
against either currency in New York.
Several MPs asked Mr Clarke if he was worried that sterling's recent rise
would hurt recovery. But the chancellor said the pound's rise since he took
office had been 'modest' and reflected 'underlying economic reality' such as
the healthier performance of the economy.
Mr Clarke said inflationary pressures in Britain were weak but pointed out
that forecasters envisaged inflation rising by the end of the year.
Yesterday's economic news failed to enthuse the stock market, partly because
investors saw less chance of an early interest rate cut. The FTSE 100 share
index dropped 9.8 to 2814.1.

FT  21 JUL 93 / International Company News: Decision on Efim legal action
expected next week
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FOREIGN bank creditors of Italy's Efim state holding company should know
next week whether a majority has voted for legal action against the company,
and, possibly, the Italian government.
The vote followed a tense 3 1/2 -hour meeting of foreign bank creditors in
London last week at which bankers were asked to consider various options,
including legal action.
The increased tension between foreign bank creditors, which provided about
L3,500bn (Dollars 2.2bn) of Efim's total borrowings of about L8,800bn to
financial institutions, follows mounting dissatisfaction among creditor
banks at the failure to receive initial repayments, a year after Efim was
put into voluntary liquidation.
Shortly before initial repayments were due at the end of April, a
representative of Mr Alberto Predieri, the special administrator running
Efim, said the situation would be frozen until a dispute over swap contracts
undertaken by Efim was resolved.
The issue has since been overshadowed by the European Commission's refusal
to approve the Italian government's repayment plans.
However, one banker involved said: 'Even if the Commission gives its
approval tomorrow, the Italians will not pay us back until the swaps are
sorted out.'
The dispute has incensed foreign bank creditors and raised a serious point
of principle.
Although only one transaction is involved, bankers are trying to reconstruct
whether other transactions may be at risk.
Last October, Bankers Trust terminated a swap contracted by Efim on the
grounds of default.
The previous month, it had informed Mr Predieri and the Italian Treasury
that the conditions of the swap were not being respected, and that it could
be terminated.
The matter remained unnoticed until April, when officials from Mr Predieri's
office told bankers no repayments would be made until the issue of the swap
was resolved.
Terminating the swap, believed to include foreign exchange and interest rate
elements, affected Efim's finances because of last year's lira devaluation.
Details of the transaction have not been revealed. However, termination has
increased Efim's foreign exposure in lira terms.
'I don't think the sums we are talking about are at all large in comparison
with the principal and interest due on Efim's debts,' said Mr John Reffell,
a banker at Chase Manhattan in London, who is chairing the activities of the
group of agent banks involved in Efim's foreign loans.
'It's a question of principle that's involved. You can't just demand that a
swap be reinstated. That goes completely against market practice. The issue
at stake is much broader than just Efim.'
Bankers also argue the swaps were contracted independently of the loans.
'The banks involved in the loans are independent of the bank doing the swap.
Moreover, the latter didn't necessarily swap the whole amount,' said one
banker.

FT  21 JUL 93 / German car production sinks lower in June
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE slight improvement in German car orders, detected during May, ground to
a halt again last month, the VDA automobile industry association said
yesterday.
June production of all vehicles, adjusted to allow for an extra working day
this year, was 29 per cent lower than a year earlier at 344,000. Unadjusted
output was down 25 per cent, the association said.
Despite last month's setback, the decline in the car industry appeared to
have reached the bottom, it added, but conditions for commercial vehicle
makers were continuing to deteriorate in a slump which has now entered its
third year.
June's poor performance brought the cumulative decline in motor
manufacturers' output to 25 per cent for the first half of this year. In
absolute figures, car production has tumbled 625,000 to 1.975m.
Output of light trucks up to 6 tonnes fell 34 per cent or 37,000 units to
72,000 between January and June, while output of other commercial vehicles
was down 36 per cent compared with the same period last year.
Most manufacturers have dealt with the slump by closing their works for at
least one day a week for most of the year so far, while tackling the
industry's structural problems with radical cost- and job-cutting
programmes.
Meanwhile, the industry has been busy reducing heavy stocks of vehicles
which accumulated when the forecast recovery in international markets failed
to appear at the end of last year.
Inventories were further bloated by a sudden slump in domestic demand after
the summer holiday period last year, when the post-unification sales boom
ran out of steam.
The German trade enjoyed a brief surge late last year, inspired by buyers
rushing to avoid the effects of a one percentage point increase in value
added tax in January, before continuing its decline.
There are still no clear signs of overall improvement in Germany, where
recession and fear of unemployment are still affecting demand, but there are
some indications that foreign car markets may be coming off the bottom. Car
exports, which account for around half the industry's output, were 19 per
cent lower in June than in the same month last year, after being 25 per cent
and 24 per cent lower in the two preceding months.
Overall, car sales abroad are 20 per cent down in the six months to the end
of June.
The VDA, which in May reported a small improvement in car orders for the
first time this year, said government plans to increase fuel taxes next
January were hampering recovery.
At the start of the year most German manufacturers forecast a 20 per cent
drop in domestic car sales for 1993 and a decline of around 10 per cent in
Europe as a whole. New registrations in the European Community in the first
half were down 19 per cent, according to the European motor manufacturers'
association.

FT  21 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: Reuters gains
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A strong recommendation for Reuters from Lehman Brothers ensured that the
shares remained in positive territory, adding 8 at 1392p, in a poor day in
the market.
Mr Alastair Smellie at the US investment bank believes that Reuters'
'unrivalled market penetration, its quality and visibility of earnings,
enormous financial strength and accelerating growth prospects more than
justify its current premium rating'. He predicted that the stock would rise
to 1600p within the next year. The company reports interim figures next
week.
Chemicals manufacturer BOC Group rose 6 to 655p as Hoare Govett recommended
the stock. The broker said the shares have underperformed by 20 per cent
this year and look good value. At the same time, Hoare downgraded Laporte
from Pounds 114m to Pounds 110m for this year, citing tough trading
conditions. The shares fell 17 to 578p.
Results from SmithKline Beecham came in at the top end of market forecasts,
helping the shares put on 3 at 419p. Pre-tax profits grew 15 per cent to
Pounds 601m from Pounds 521m. Mr Robert Bauman, the chief executive, said
the group's performance was satisfactory, but he warned of an increasing
degree of uncertainty in the drugs sector due to economic and regulatory
pressures.
Meanwhile, selected drugs stocks bounced from their recent weakness as
investors looked for bargains. Wellcome advanced 17 to 621p and Glaxo 8 to
531p.
Calm came to the second day's trading in the new BT partly-paid shares and
they closed a halfpenny ahead at 168 1/2 p. Turnover was 41m, against
Monday's 187m, as the profit-takers faded and the stock settled into a
narrow trading range. BT ordinary were unchanged at 413 1/2 p.
Second line hotel issues, battered in recent sessions following the
suspension of Resort Hotels, staged a modest rally, although confidence in
the UK economic recovery remained uncertain. Stakis, helped by reinforced
positive stances from Hoare Govett and Smith New Court, firmed 3 to 55p in
volume of 1.2m. Friendly Hotels moved up 4 to 202p.
British Aerospace retreated 18 to 400p amid talk of an oversupply of defence
equipment on the market and further concern about the financing of BAe's
planned Pounds 250m regional jets joint venture with Taiwan. However, the
company's chairman said he was confident that the financing problems would
be solved shortly.
Among motor issues, GKN added 8 at 461p and T&amp;N improved 4 to 194p, with
agency broker Henderson Crosthwaite said to have been the day's big shoppers
with a view that next month's UK new car registrations should benefit both
component suppliers.
Profit-taking left Siebe 5 lighter at 492p. Strong demand for Vosper
Thornycroft following a recent visit from institutions saw the shares rise
16 to 629p. A stock shortage continued in VSEL, which climbed 15 to 863p. A
squeeze also drove Hunting 9 ahead to 236p. Bargain hunters for Meggitt
helped to reverse the recent decline in the stock. The shares hardened 3 to
105p.
The first day of dealings in engineering group Quadramatic cheered the
market. Having made its debut at 123p, the stock ended 5 higher at 128p.
In the transport sector, US selling continued in Tiphook, sending the stock
further into retreat following last week's figures which revealed a loss.
The shares closed 17 lower at 213p, but after having been lifted off the
bottom by bargain hunters.
An announcement from Ocean Group that it had won a multi-million-pound
six-year contract from Procter and Gamble for the distribution of P&amp;G's
detergents in Spain coincided with news that it is to invest Pounds 18m in
constructing an automated distribution centre in that country. The shares
gained 4 at 292p.
A technical boost buoyed Campari, the sporting clothes company. Some demand
and a dearth of sellers pushed it up 5 to 138p.
Reports that National Westminster Bank had collected details of customers'
political affiliations overhung the banking sector. NatWest dropped 15 to
491p, with talk that it may soon call on investors for cash also doing the
rounds. Lloyds receded 9 to 579p, while Barclays gave up 14 to 478p.

FT  21 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: Argyll weakens
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There was yet more gloomy news on the food retailing sector as Argyll, which
owns the Safeway supermarket chain, made a disappointing trading statement.
The shares had risen in pre-market trading on hopes of higher than expected
sales.
While these were largely in line with market forecasts, they were
accompanied by a warning from the company that: 'Sales inflation influenced
in part by the highly competitive trading conditions continues at record low
levels.' Market pessimism at food price inflation levels, combined with
tighter margins, had led to several downgradings of the sector in recent
weeks.
Yesterday, Argyll declined 11 to 302p, its lowest level for 18 months, in
turnover of 7.1m. Kwik Save shed 7 to 670p, J. Sainsbury 8 to 450p and Tesco
5 to 204p.

FT  21 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: Utilities strong
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Utilities were seized as a port in the storm as nervous investors grew
increasingly concerned about prospects for economic recovery and retreated
into defensive stocks.
The regional electricity companies made the most powerful gains, with the
stocks boasting attractive yields and trading on the back of a strong
per-formance on the previous day when 10 of them went ex-dividend.
Such a strong showing increased interest in 'recs' and fuelled a squeeze on
the stocks.
One analyst forecast the recs' fortunes to ride the wave for a little while
to come, stressing that their popularity is underpinned by sound finances.
'There is certainly no reason to be selling them.'
Eastern Electricity moved up 9 to 484p, East Midlands made the same gain and
ended at 466p and London put on 11 at 494p, while Northern advanced 13 to
523p, South Wales 12 to 553p and Yorkshire 14 to 522p.
Water utilities bounced against the market trend in more modest fashion.
Anglian rose 4 to 475p, North West gained 4 at 467p, Southern moved up 7 to
490p and Yorkshire ended 5 higher at 491p.

<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FRESH shivers of apprehension were sent through companies with strong brand
products as Philip Morris, the US tobacco group, announced that the
provisional price cuts it made earlier this year would now be extended to
some of its other premium brands. It also said that the reduction in the
price of its top-selling Marlborough cigarette brand would be made at the
wholesale level. BAT Industries, Unilever and Cadbury Schweppes all fell
sharply on the news, although BAT later recovered on speculative buying.
Fears over the effect of price cuts by leading brand manufacturers in
reponse to cheaper alternatives has been plagueing related stocks for some
time. Earlier this month, Procter and Gamble caused dismay among its peers
by announcing a series of price cuts, which impacted in particular on
Unilever, one of its main competitors,
Although yesterday's news affected sentiment, speculation ahead of the move
last week had already put implications of the day's developments into the
BAT price and the stock soon rallied. Dealers also pointed out that the
issue was not finally decided and that Philip Morris was also raising some
cigarette prices.
BAT finished just a halfpenny off at 430p, after 418p, following hefty
turnover of 10m shares. Unilever had a more torrid time, its shares tumbling
17 to 949p, the lowest price since September last year. Cadbury weakened 11
to 433p.

FT  21 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: Worries from the US hit blue chips
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A UK stock market already discouraged by the lukewarm investment reception
for the BT3 issue on the previous day took a turn for the worse yesterday
afternoon after Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of the US Federal Reserve,
characterised this year's US inflation trends as 'disappointing'.
Early gains in London were sharply reversed and the FT-SE 100 Index was down
by 24.3 before losses were trimmed after a rally on Wall Street. The final
reading of 2,823.9 on the Footsie left a fall on the day of 19 points.
The setback was led by a sharp fall in stock index futures. Downward
pressure on equities was said to be moderate, however, with trading in the
BT issues still making up about 10 per cent of overall turnover.
The market was helped at first by a firmer tone in pharmaceutical shares.
However, the initial gain of 6.1 on the Footsie began to melt away after a
hesitant start by the September future contract on the index. Lacking any
further excitement from the BT stocks, the equity market hung fire until a
sell-off in stock index futures sounded the alarm ahead of Mr Greenspan's
prepared address to the US Senate Banking Committee.
Disappointment with the news of 3.3 per cent annualised growth in UK M4
money supply eased after comments on the outlook for domestic inflation from
UK economists, but broader confidence was damaged by Mr Greenspan's
discouraging views on inflation across the Atlantic.
Firmness in sterling reduced the chances of a cut in domestic base rates,
thus undermining one of the few remaining props beneath near-term confidence
in equities. As the close of trading drew nigh, optimism was fast
disappearing and there was a ready audience for suggestions that a big UK
bank might announce a large rights issue this morning. However, many traders
scouted such rumours.
The gloom over the market was also shown in another modest decline by second
line issues, bringing a dip of 6.3 to 3,205.0 in the FT-SE Mid 250 Index.
But trading in the second liners was down to about 58 per cent of the day's
Seaq total of 604.7m shares. On Monday, when business was boosted by the BT3
issue, Seaq reported 760.4m shares dealt, for a retail worth of Pounds
1.51bn.
Consumer sectors paid little heed to the latest report from the
Confederation of British Industry, which indicated that June brought the
sixth consecutive monthly rise in UK retail sales.
The CBI report also said that the sales recovery was patchy, lending support
to the stock market's doubts about the economic recovery in the UK.
The slide in the market was the more disturbing for market strategists
because the drugs sector, which has been a significantly bearish drag on UK
equities, was firmer yesterday. Doubts were expressed as to the likely
duration of the rally in pharmaceutical stocks and traders looked keenly
yesterday for signs that the international fund managers were prepared to
return to a sector which has cost so many of them dear in the setback.
With valuations of the UK stock market still under question, and the
domestic poli-tical outlook now in jeopardy, equity analysts sounded
unwilling to be drawn on the short term prospects for share prices.

FT  21 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A QUIET morning proved to be the calm before the storm in stock index
futures after gloomy signs for the US economy tested investors' nerves,
Christine Buckley writes.
Virtually ignoring the mid-morning UK money supply figures, dealers reacted
actively to pessimistic remarks from the Federal Reserve on the US inflation
rate and sold the FT-SE 100 September contract down. Fears were further
fuelled by speculation over the possibility of an interest rate rise in the
US.
Such a violent reaction proved the poor underlying state of the futures
market, according to one trader, who did not expect much promise to be seen
before the August bank holiday. Some market watchers fear that the
underlying support level of 2,780 for the September contract may soon make
an appearance in trading.
The contract greeted the day at 2,858 and enjoyed a brief spell at 2,863
before slipping back. The Fed's remarks pushed it to the day's low of 2,820
at about 3.30pm. A slight rally left it closing at 2,824 after 9,933
contracts traded. It trailed its fair value premium to cash by 1.9 points.
Traded options had a lacklustre day with trade edging up only slightly to
20,879 lots from Monday's total. The FT-SE 100 option took the lion's share,
at 8,493 contracts. Of stock options, only British Airways deals exceeded
1,000 lots, reaching 1,261.

aid general tone

<TEXT>
Wall Street
A REVIVAL in the technology sector helped Wall Street to move higher
yesterday after posting early losses, writes Karen Zagor in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished a net 9.50 ahead at 3,544.78 after
falling more than 17 points initially. The more broadly based Standard &amp;
Poor's 500 gained 1.28 at 447.31, while the Nasdaq composite advanced 6.07
to 701.90. Trading volume on the New York SE amounted to 277m shares.
Stocks lost ground at the outset after Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of the
Federal Reserve, said inflation was disappointing this year. Although the
major indices had turned higher by midsession, overall market sentiment was
mixed and, on the big board, declining shares outnumbered those rising by
1,054 to 866.
Most of yesterday's share price movements were tied to quarterly results
announcements. Sears Roebuck, the Chicago-based retailer, jumped Dollars 4
1/8 to Dollars 50 1/8 on the back of second-quarter earnings of Dollars 1.51
a share, excluding special gains. A year ago the company earned 85 cents a
share.
Merck, the world's biggest drugs group, firmed Dollars 1 to Dollars 33 1/8 .
The company posted operating income of 61 cents a share, up from 56 cents,
and said it would cut 2,100 jobs this year, against a previously announced
figure of 1,000.
A number of big US banks posted better credit quality and strong foreign and
other trading profits. In spite of improved results, Citicorp eased Dollars
 1/4 to Dollars 31 3/4 , Nationsbank slipped Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 49 and
Chemical Bank held steady at Dollars 39 3/4 .
In Nasdaq trading, the technology sector turned higher after several days of
being battered by Apple Computer's weak third-quarter performance. Shares in
Apple, which have fallen sharply since late last week, put on Dollars 1 1/4
at Dollars 26 7/8 .
The sector picked up after BMC Software unveiled strong first-quarter
earnings late on Monday. BMC forged ahead Dollars 5 5/8 to Dollars 56 1/8 .
Also in the sector, Microsoft rose Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 80 1/2 , Intel
Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 52 and Lotus Development Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars
37 3/8 .
IBM, however, slipped Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 42 7/8 in New York SE trading,
reflecting investor concern about the company's dividend and the fear of
more restructuring charges.
Canada
TORONTO closed mixed after fairly heavy trading. The TSE 300 index finished
a modest 8.4 up at 3,876.1 but declining issues outscored advances by 382 to
339. Volume totalled 57.9m shares, up from Monday's 48.2m, and trading value
rose to CDollars 587m.
Eight of the 14 sub-indices closed higher, led by conglomerates, up 2.0 per
cent.

FT  21 JUL 93 / World Stock Markets: Bolsa looks for signals as Spanish
economy recedes - The post-election mood
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Spain's stock market professionals are making an intense study of the
government that Mr Felipe Gonzalez, the newly reappointed prime minister,
selected last week.
The Bolsa is looking for government signals that will hint at future
interest rate movements and possible fluctuations in the value of the
peseta. Until it is certain that it is reading such messages correctly, its
watchword is extreme caution.
This is understandable. The signals so far are conflicting, while the
economic problems are all too clear.
Spain is in recession. Growth estimates for this year vary between zero and
minus 1 per cent, and the financial community has clear ideas about what has
to be done. Public spending must be stopped in its tracks, it says, unit
labour costs must be reduced demonstrably and private sector borrowing must
become substantially cheaper.
Next week the national statistics institute will publish its labour force
survey for the second quarter of the year. This is expected to show that
107,000 jobs were lost between April and June, raising the unemployment rate
by one percentage point to 22.7 per cent and the jobless total to 3.4m.
Surgical measures are required to kick start the economy, and the Bolsa into
action. Unless the government has shown its hand forcefully by the time
these first-half employment figures are published, the peseta could come
under pressure.
Already there is widespread dismay over the public deficit. By May it had
grown by 24.4 per cent against the first five months of last year and was
already close to the total deficit forecast for 1993.
The political situation, however, is fluid. It is not yet clear just how far
Mr Gonzalez's new team is willing or able to take the required surgical
measures.
The new economy and finance minister, Mr Pedro Solbes, a technocrat and a
non-socialist, says he plans an austere budget and so, indeed, does Mr
Gonzalez. But the prime minister also says that he wants to maintain social
spending at its present levels, and that he wants a social pact with the
unions.
The unions, which recently have been negotiating wage increases of more than
6 per cent, at least 1.5 percentage points above inter-annual headline
inflation, say they are willing to moderate their wage claims; but in return
they will want the government to shelve a planned overhaul of Spain's rigid
hiring and firing rules.
Just about the only good news on the economic front is that the recession
has hampered imports and narrowed the trade deficit. The January to May
accumulated trade deficit was down by 38 per cent compared with the first
five months of last year, and it represented 4 per cent of GDP against 6.1
per cent at the end of last year.
Much more good news, nevertheless, is necessary. Calling for government
action, market players use macho images: 'Now is the time to take the bull
by the horns,' says one. This means, among other things, recognising that
current social spending is unsustainable; and taking on the unions.
Gestemar, the securities arm of the March group, wants 'a swift and strong
reduction in interest rates to 8 per cent or even lower (down from the
current intervention rate of 11 per cent) during the next 12 months'. It
also wants the peseta to fluctuate within its ERM range, or 'even leave the
system if necessary'.
The 'cut and run and go for growth' argument is doing the rounds in Madrid
but, so far, it has made little impact among senior policy makers. This is
principally because Spain needs to import capital and can ill-afford an
over-weakened currency that will raise the cost of its borrowing.
A more likely scenario is a halfway house, in which the government will be
more forceful than many in the market currently expect, although less so
than they say is necessary.
The budget will be more restrictive than in the past, the unions will be
more reasonable and unit labour costs will ease somewhat. Interest rates
will come down only very gradually, tracking the Germans, and the peseta,
which has remained generally below Pta77 to the D-Mark, could slide towards
its central parity of Pta79.11.
In these circumstances some observers think it wise to give the Bolsa a rest
for a while. By the end of May, in advance of the political uncertainties
and the worsening economic figures, Madrid's market had put on some 20 per
cent. At the beginning of this year, this was the gain that most analysts
had expected for the whole of 1993.

KARACHI yesterday recorded one of its biggest gains this year, with the KSE

The index finished 26.69 stronger at 1,307.43 in response to assurances from
Pakistan's interim government, led by Mr Moeen Qureshi, the new prime
minister, that liberal economic policies would remain on track.
Mr Nasir Ali Shah Bukhari, chief executive of brokers Khadim Ali Shah
Bukhari, said the market was picking up because 'short-term uncertainties
were over' with the ending of the six-month long political crisis.

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PROLONGED uncertainty over the political situation and tomorrow's trial of
Mr Shin Kanemaru, former kingmaker of the Liberal Democratic party, sent
share prices lower in tandem with a weak futures market, writes Emiko
Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei average closed 112.92 down at 20,038.00, having opened at the
day's high of 20,123.11 and fallen to the session's low of 19,977.40 in the
afternoon.
Volume totalled 240m shares, against 266m. Declines led advances by 697 to
249, with 210 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks
shed 10.05 to 1,634.63 but, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 0.02 to
1,244.36.
The index was initially depressed by arbitrage linked selling, later losing
further ground on profit-taking. Traders said that while prices were
supported by hopes of credit easing, weak fundamentals kept the index from
rising above the 21,000 level.
Calls for the resignation of Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister,
heightened. Mr Juniichiro Koizumi, stepped down from his post as minister of
post and communications yesterday, adding pressure on Mr Miyazawa to resign.
A fund manager at Nippon Life, the leading life assurer, said that it was
not the time to increase exposure to stocks. 'The elections left us with a
vague uncertainty, especially over the course of the economy,' he added.
Brokerage houses declined, with the sector falling 1.4 per cent, due to
prospects of weaker profits in light of the equity market's recent low
activity. Nomura Securities retreated Y50 to Y2,030.
Profit-taking depressed stocks which were higher early in the week on
reports of the listing of DDI, a new telecom company. Ushio dropped Y19 to
Y963 and Kyocera lost Y160 to Y6,300. However, trading companies with links
to DDI firmed, with Itochu rising Y7 to Y572 and Mitsubishi gaining Y10 at
Y1,070.
Hazama, the construction concern, fell Y19 to Y457 as the company was
implicated in another bribery scandal.
Nikkatsu, the bankrupt movie producer and distributor, was the day's most
active issue, falling Y4 to Y19.
In Osaka, the OSE average lost 137.00 to 22,226.56 in volume of 23.3m
shares. Ono Pharmaceutical fell Y50 to Y5,550.
Roundup
PACIFIC Rim markets experienced mixed fortunes.
HONG KONG rebounded after early weakness and the Hang Seng index was finally
33.09 up at 6,846.81 as local, Japanese and US demand picked up on
expectations of positive results from the current round of Sino-British
talks.
AUSTRALIA pushed forward through the 1,800 level, led by strong advances by
BHP and CRA. The All Ordinaries index ended 9.9 higher at 1,806.1 in
turnover of ADollars 319.6m. BHP rose 20 cents to ADollars 14.68, while CRA
added 24 cents at ADollars 13.60.
TAIPEI edged down in turnover that shrank to its lowest level since January.
The weighted index finished 9.97 lower at 3,907.84 amid concern about the
economy and political tensions ahead of the ruling Nationalist party's
congress in August.
MANILA blue chips advanced to catch up with the strong performance of
secondary issues, and the composite index rose 29.07, or 1.8 per cent, to
1,650.77.
SEOUL was again restrained by the labour disputes at Hyundai and the need
for financial institutions to meet by-monthly reserve requirements tomorrow,
but the composite index managed a 0.5 improvement to 749.88.

FT  21 JUL 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Zurich slips 2 per cent on
profit-taking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A WEAK start on Wall Street was a contributory factor to losses on many of
the late closing bourses, writes Our Markets Staff.
ZURICH finally succumbed to a round of profit-taking after its recent strong
run which left the SMI index down 57.9 or 2.4 per cent at 2,324.1, after a
day's low of 2,317.3.
The selling pressure built up in the absence of domestic buyers and with
many foreign investors now turning their attention elsewhere.
Mr Frederick Hasslauer, of Swiss Volksbank in Zurich, believes that the
market could see a further downward correction of around 3 per cent in the
next two weeks.
'The market has been strong since the start of the year, with a rise of 15
per cent since the beginning of May,' he said. 'On the back of that, a 5 per
cent correction from the top of the market would be seen as a healthy sign
from a chart point of view and by the market.'
UBS bearers led the market lower, shedding SFr42 to SFr1,125, while selling
by London investors left Nestle down SFr27 at SFr1,048. Roche certificates
continued under pressure, dipping SFr110 to SFr4,895. Brown Boveri continued
to buck the trend. A SFr18 rise to SFr857 was attributed to market rumours
that a US broker had placed the shares on its buy list.
FRANKFURT inched up to a new high in the official session, but lost it in
the post-bourse as the Swiss market fell. The DAX index rose 2.70 to
1,838.99 before an Ibis-indicated 1,826.52 in the afternoon.
Turnover eased from DM9.4bn to DM9.2bn. The worst casualties in the post
bourse were, first, shares of which the market had cause to be wary and,
secondly, those which had excited speculators and investors over recent
days.
Volkswagen saw the adverse ruling it feared in the Spiegel/Lopez case,
incorporated Monday's post-bourse weakness to fall DM6.80 to DM351 on the
session, and shed another DM4.50 to DM346.50 in the afternoon yesterday.
Daimler fell DM13.50 overall to DM679.50.
BASF gained DM3.40 on its Russian and gas pipeline initiatives, and then
lost DM4.40 to DM260.50 in the afternoon; in utilities, improved sentiment
in Viag, which itself put on DM4.70 to DM412.20, reflected on RWE, which
gained DM6.70 to DM412.20; but RWE lost DM4.20 of that after hours.
PARIS followed other bourses lower in the afternoon session after early
trading had been lent some support by industrial production data which
showed a 0.2 per cent rise in May against a 0.6 per cent decline a month
earlier.
The CAC-40 index closed off 13.26 at 1,968.44, after a high of 1,986 and a
low of 1,964, in turnover estimated at some FFr2bn.
BSN extended Monday's FFr15 fall as fears continued to develop that branded
products mare likely to face aggressive competition from non-brands. The
shares closed down FFr10 at FFr842.
In the automotive sector Peugeot dropped FFr15 to FFr618 and Michelin
FFr6.10 to FFr168.50; while Euro Disney picked up from its day's low of
FFr56.90 as selling developed following the overnight close in New York of
its parent, Walt Disney, which fell to a new 1993 low. Euro Disney finally
closed off 20 centimes at FFr58.00.
AMSTERDAM fell back sharply in late trading on technical selling and some
profit-taking and the CBS Tendency index closed the day off 2.2 or 1.8 per
cent at 117.2.
Stocks which had made impressive movements on Monday slipped back, including
Nedlloyd, down Fl 2.70 to Fl 39.10, after its 10 per cent gain the day
before.
Among other declines, Unilever lost Fl 5.50 to Fl 187.70, DSM Fl 2.20 to Fl
98.00 and Elsevier Fl 2.30 to Fl 135.50.
KLM fell Fl 1.20 to Fl 32.20 and denied reports that merger talks with other
European airlines had almost reached an agreement. After the close the
airline said that it was to combine all flights to and from the US with
Northwest Airlines, its US partner.
MILAN drew strength from the strong performance of Fiat and Generali and the
Comit index advanced 6.61 to 561.74.
Rumours of an announcement before the end of the month on an asset sale or
international accord helped Fiat L187 ahead to L6,948. Generali put on L331
to L40,200.
Olivetti, L53 or 3 per cent higher at L1,818, remained in demand amid
speculation that it will shortly break Sip's mobile telephone monopoly.
Montedison, L65.70 or 11 per cent higher at L656.70, and Ferruzzi, L32.30 or
9 per cent ahead at L381.80, remained volatile after news of the death of
the former ENI chairman, Mr Gabriele Cagliari. Montedison is involved in a
judicial investigation over its involvement in Enimont, a former joint
venture with ENI.
STOCKHOLM remained strong, the Affarsvarlden general index putting on 3.60
to 1,155.70, in spite of further easing in Ericcson B shares, down SKr13 to
SKr365.

FT  21 JUL 93 / Money Markets: German rate puzzle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHANIE FLANDERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN markets were yesterday awash with speculation about German interest
rate cuts, as the Bundesbank offered few clear signals either way, writes
Stephanie Flanders.
On Monday, many in European money markets were preparing for lower German
rates, claiming that the Bundesbank's two-day currency pact led the way for
a lower fixed repo rate in this week's tender round. But yesterday the
German central bank announced a variable rate repo tender, not the clear
signal of future rate cuts which optimists had anticipated.
Analysts are divided as to whether German interest rates will fall before
the Bundesbank's summer recess. Arguing against are those listening to
rumours that German M3 growth in June, to be released some time this week,
will have been higher than the 6.6 per cent which most forecasters
predicted.
Yesterday morning there were unsubstantiated claims that it would be closer
to 7 or even 7.5 per cent, which would make it more difficult for the German
central bank to lower rates at next week's council meeting.
Dealers, who continue to anticipate a German rate cut, claim that the
current, relatively high, level of reserves among German banks will ensure
that a lower repo rate emerges from this morning's tender: perhaps 7.20 per
cent, down from last week's 7.28 per cent. This, they claim, would not rule
out an official rate reduction next week.
Renewed ERM worries took French money market rates back up to the higher
levels of last week. French three-month money ended at around 7.68 per cent
on the bid side, up nearly 40 basis points from Monday's bid of 7.30 per
cent.
In London money markets, analysts reported a general return to economic
fundamen-tals in the pricing of UK instruments. This, they said, was driving
the rise of ster-ling, but would only translate fully into domestic money
markets until the outcome of tomorrow's Maastricht vote in the House of
Commons is known.
At the short end of sterling markets, overnight money traded at 5 3/8 per
cent for most of the day, and closed at much the same level. The Bank of
England more than met a Pounds 1.55bn shortage in technical operations in
the morning and afternoon.

FT  21 JUL 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Sterling attracts buyers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHANIE FLANDERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE POUND put on a strong performance yesterday in European currency
markets, in spite of the uncertainty hanging over the UK government and a
mixed batch of econ-omic figures, writes Stephanie Flanders.
Sterling made rapid gains against the D-Mark in the morning's trading,
reaching DM2.5750, before slipping during the afternoon to close at
DM2.5650, still a pfennig higher on the day. At first glance, the pound's
strength was surprising, when the possibility of a government defeat over
the Maastricht treaty tomorrow and subdued monetary growth figures might
have sent the currency in the other direction.
Analysts, however, said sterling was being driven higher by the sense that
it was a better investment opportunity than other currencies. The ERM
currencies were yesterday again focused on the future prospects for German
interest rate cuts, while the yen - still overshadowed by Japan's current
political vacuum - suffered further losses yesterday due to a larger than
expected fall in the country's leading indicators.
In continental Europe, the French franc lost ground once again against the
D-Mark, finishing in London at FFr3.417, a centime below Monday's FFr3.407.
The Italian lira suffered even more against the D-Mark, ending at L935.3,
down L8.5 from Monday's finish of L926.8.
Although the yen continues to be sidelined by events in Europe, the Japanese
currency fell yesterday when the country's index of leading indicators
dropped from 63.6 to just 30. As a result, the yen declined to Y164.12
against sterling during the afternoon, down from a previous close of Y162.5.
It later recovered to end at Y162.8.
With the outlook cloudy for Japan and the core European currencies so
unattractive, Britain's generally encouraging economic figures of recent
weeks continue to attract dealers to sterling, argue many analysts.
'The sterling exchange rate is determined by the UK markets, not British
politics,' said Mr Christian Dunis of Chemical Bank in London. 'Compared to
what is driving most currency movements, House of Commons votes are somewhat
esoteric.'
For most of the day the dollar conspicuously failed to gain from tensions in
the ERM. But the chairman of the Federal Reserve's comments to congress,
indicating that the next move in US rates will be up rather than down, took
the American currency higher in afternoon trading. The dollar finished at
DM1.7090, up from DM1.7055. But in New York it closed at DM1.6997.
The American unit also recovered against sterling, having fallen as low as
Dollars 1.51 in the early afternoon. At the end of trading in London, the
dollar stood at Dollars 1.5015 to the pound, a little below the previous
Dollars 1.4985. In New York it retreated to end at Dollars 1.5105.

FT  21 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: India aims for palm oil boost
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   CALCUTTA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ITC AGRO-TECH and Mac Industries are among a group of companies which,
encouraged by the federal government, plan to build integrated palm oil
complexes in India.
For technologies to promote oil palm plantation and set up crushing and
refining factories they are turning to Malaysia, the world's largest
producer of palm oil and India's most important supplier.
During the period of the present five year plan, ending in 1996-97, the
official target is to have at least 80,000 hectares (195,000 acres) under
oil palm. This, however, constitutes only a small proportion of the nearly
575,000ha identified as suitable for oil palm cultivation by an expert
committee appointed by the agriculture ministry.
Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka, the two southern states, each with the
potential to grow oil palm over 250,000ha, will emerge as the most important
centres for the crop. ITC and Mac have taken the first steps to promote oil
palm plantation in Andhra Pradesh. ITC, whose partner in the venture is
Kumpulan Emas of Malaysia, has already been allocated 20,000ha by the Andhra
Pradesh government. It will eventually have 100,000ha under oil palm. Both
companies are importing seedlings from Papua New Guinea to set up nurseries.
According to industry officials, the success of oil palm cultivation in
India will depend largely on the quality of farm services support provided
to the growers by the companies, which must be ready to buy oil palm fruits
at 'remunerative prices'.
Initially, however, the companies will need financial assistance from the
government, which believes that oil palm plantation on a large scale could
make the country self sufficient in edible oil and also release high value
oils, such as sunflower, for export.
The government is considering the imposition of a levy on the vegetable oil
industry to finance the support of oil palm cultivation.
Oil palm is the highest yielding oil plant, with the productivity ranging
from three to five tonnes of oil per hectare.

FT  21 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Nellore cultivates a taste for
seafood - The Indian region is ideal for aquaculture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SHIRAZ SIDHVA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SCORCHING hot sun and the treacherous terrain of Nellore in Andhra
Pradesh, South India, may be hostile for humans, but it is ideal for
aquaculture. Here, the cultivation of aquatic livestock, such as prawns,
shrimps, scampi, squid and lobster, under controlled conditions is being
encouraged by the Indian government to increase exports.
Responding to the growing demand for seafood worldwide, with quick returns
on comparatively low investments, several large Indian companies, including
ITC, the tobacco, agri-products and hotels company, the Bombay-based
Hindustan Lever and Tata groups, the Delhi-based Thapar group, the
Madras-based MRF Tyres and Britannia Biscuits are all entering the lucrative
aquaculture market. In Nellore, which has the right degree of salinity in
the water and is naturally shielded from the vagaries of the cyclone, 20
semi-intensive, export-oriented units have sprung up in the last year alone.
Shrimps accounted for 71 per cent or Rs9.79bn (Pounds 210m) of the country's
Rs13.73bn seafood exports last year, and could be used to increase India's
dismal 1.14 per cent share in the Dollars 40bn global seafood market. The
country, with its 7,500km coastline and an estimated 1.2m hectares (3m
acres) of coastal area ripe for exploitation by shrimp farmers, has distinct
advantages over its three main competitors, China, Thailand and Indonesia.
China, the world leader in the farmed shrimp market, exports Dollars 1.5bn
of shrimps a year, 21 per cent of the Dollars 7.2bn global market. To
achieve a similar level of production, India would need to develop 90,000
hectares of land for shrimp cultivation - 7.5 per cent of the total land
available for shrimp farming - compared with the 27,000ha at present devoted
to that purpose.
Other advantages like cheap labour and land costs could push India to the
top of of the shrimp export league from its present 4.5 per cent share of
the global market. The Ministry of Commerce's Marine Products Export
Development Authority, which promotes aquaculture and runs a 10ha
demonstration farm in Nellore, is working toward bringing an additional
14,000ha under shrimp farming. 'But India will have to cultivate an
additional 90,500ha of land to be the world's foremost shrimp exporter,'
said an official of the commerce ministry. 'Traditional methods of
aquaculture are still being used, though farmers are realising how
dramatically they can increase their yield by switching to semi-intensive
aquaculture. Shrimp exports have increased by 23 per cent in the last four
years, and we reckon that total earnings from shrimp exports could touch
Rs90bn by the year 2000, taking us to the top.'
Breaking into the fiercely competitive world market has not been easy,
according to Mr Elias Sait, managing director of Alsa Marine and Harvests, a
Madras-based aquaculture company, with farms and processing factories in
Nellore, Puri and Bhubaneswar in Orissa, Vizag in Andhra Pradesh, Calcutta
and Cochin. Alsa Marine, with an export turnover of Rs340m, was one of the
first Indian companies to market branded Indian shrimps to the European and
Japanese markets, and many other companies are following suit.
At present, however, 95 per cent of India's seafood exports are unbranded,
with large consignments being block-frozen, instead of packaged for
super-market shelves.
Indian aquaculture companies, besides looking to markets in Japan, which has
been the largest importer of Indian seafood, Europe, the US and the Middle
East, are also collaborating with foreign companies to be able to compete
internationally. The Madras-based Aquamarine Food Products, which recently
began operations at its fully export-oriented project in Nellore, has
marketing tie-ups with seafood distributors Fiesta Mart, Beaver Street
Fisheries of the US and Itoman, Toyo Kosuisan of Japan to market its branded
and bulk products.
Sprawling over an area of 160ha, with 132ha of waterspread, in Nellore,
Aquamarine's hatchery, farm and processing-cum-packaging unit uses technical
assistance from Hanaqua International of Taiwan, the leader in aquaculture
techniques.
Mr S. Vijaya Kumar, Aquamarine's managing director, said the integrated
project cost Rs185.9m, but with a large grow-out area and higher yields per
hectare, the business should yield good dividends within a year.
'Aquaculture is going to be big business in the 1990s,' he said. He could
well be right, with more than 30 Indian companies entering the fray and
investing a total of Rs10bn in new projects over the next year.

London's robusta COFFEE futures closed firmer but below the day's highs. The
market was showing signs that it might be poised to break above its recent
range. Roasters appeared to be trying to increase their cover and origins
appeared to be cutting sales in the expectation of further gains. Producer
talks on a retention scheme were beginning to be taken seriously by the
trade after initial scepticism. Brazil, in particular, has been more
supportive than some expected. Chicago SOYABEAN futures were sagging at
midsession on profit taking, tied to ideas that the market was extremely
overbought. Trading was choppy as the market continued to digest numerous
reports and opinions about the extent of flood-damage to the crop in the
western US Midwest. 'There is a lot of profit taking and nervousness,' one
trader said. Three-month COPPER see-sawed routinely either side of Dollars
1,900 a tonne on the London Metal Exchange with support around Dollars 1,890
providing a pivotal rallying point. Three-month ALUMINIUM broke higher in
early afternoon trading on US buying which found sellers backing away.

FT  21 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Nickel prices crash to 6-year
lows as stocks rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NICKEL PRICES crashed to fresh six-year lows on the London Metal Exchange
yesterday as stocks reached a record.
Metal for delivery in three months fell through the Dollars 5,000-a-tonne
level to close down Dollars 109 at Dollars 4,913.50 a tonne, equivalent to
Dollars 2.23 a lb. Stocks in LME warehouses rose by 1,322 tonnes to 97,104
tonnes.
Mr Angus MacMillan, of Billiton-Enthoven, part of the Royal Dutch/Shell
group, said that the fall reflected 'a combination of ever-worsening
fundamentals'.
The first half had seen strong consumption of nickel by the stainless steel
industry, tight supplies of stainless steel scrap and less metal exported
from the CIS. This led to a draw-down of LME stocks in June, which fell from
96,000 tonnes to 85,476 tonne at the beginning of this month.
But exports from the CIS had resumed just as stainless steel scrap was
becoming readily available, said Mr MacMillan. 'The downward pressure will
be maintained,' he predicted. 'We are heading for 100,000 tonnes of stocks
this autumn.'
Mr William Adams, analyst with Rudolf Wolff, said the market had been
looking to trade down.
'There's not an awful lot of optimism around at the moment,' he said,
putting support at Dollars 4,800 a tonne for three-month metal.
Lead prices held steady after overnight news that Doe Run's lead smelter at
Herculaneum, Missouri had ceased production over the weekend because of the
flooding of the Mississippi river. Analysts told the Reuter news agency that
other lead mining and refining facilities in the area might be threatened by
the floods, although they are not as near to the river as the Herculaneum
smelter.

HYDRO ALUMINIUM of Norway has joined Indian Aluminium, an associate of Alcan
of Canada and Tata Industries to promote a 1m tonnes-a-year, export-oriented
alumina (aluminium oxide) project in the Koraput district of Orissa, India.
Alcan and Alusuisse will be supplying technology for the project.
According to Mr Tapan Mitra, managing director of Indian Aluminium, the
Rs22.5bn (Pounds 485m) project should start production by 1996-97. Nearly 25
per cent of the cost will be in foreign exchange.
Some of the alumina will be sold in advance to raise finance for the unit.
It is also proposed to get some toll smelted into aluminium abroad.
The new company to be formed to implement the project will take on leases of
bauxite (aluminium ore) mines in Orissa with estimated deposits of 200m
tonnes.

<TEXT>
THE SHANGHAI Metal Exchange has rejected applications from several major
overseas firms, saying China is not yet ready for foreign members, according
to official reports, reports Reuter from Beijing.
The exchange's deputy director, Mr Hu Yuezheng, quoted by the official China
Daily, said American Express, Merrill Lynch and Samsung Company of South
Korea had sought seats on the exchange but were refused.
'The time is not ripe,' Mr Hu said. 'We will not rush into recruiting
international members, as foreign organisations have started trading in (the
exchange) through Chinese members.'
Mr Hu said foreign members could not be recruited as long as the quality of
Chinese metal lagged behind international standards, the futures trading
rules did not conform to international norms and a multi-currency exchange
system was not in place to facilitate settlement.
The Shanghai Metal Exchange has 55 Chinese members serving nearly 1,700
clients.
Trading was active in the first half of 1993. By the end of June, turnover
had reached 145bn yuan (Pounds 16.8bn) - three times the total for the whole
of 1992, the China Daily said.

FT  21 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Jittery oil market awaits Opec
action
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A JITTERY World oil market looked to the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting
Countries for action this week to halt the collapse in prices that has been
caused by expectations of Iraq's return to the export market.
But although member countries have agreed to meet in Vienna next Wednesday,
their room for manoeuvre is severely limited. The uncertainty surrounding
Opec's action and the likelihood of an Iraqi agreement with the United
Nations on oil exports will add to price volatility in the coming week.
'It is very difficult for Opec to do anything, the best they can hope for is
that Iraqi exports hit the market in the fourth quarter when demand will be
higher,' said Mr Geoff Pyne, oil analyst at UBS in London.
The recovery in oil prices from a three-year low of Dollars 15.98 a barrel
in London on Monday to Dollars 16.71 yesterday bears witness to the market's
faith in Opec's ability to deal with the situation. The organisation is at
its best when managing a crisis and a collapse in price has in the past
galvanised it into decisive action.
Mr Jean Ping, Gabon's oil minister and current president of Opec, set off
for Saudi Arabia yesterday on the first leg of his tour of the Middle East,
where he will be seeking to build some degree of consensus ahead of the July
28 meeting. But some industry observers see Opec's moves as little more than
a cynical attempt to talk up the oil price.
'I'm not sure they have enough goodwill to take any decisive action,' said
Ms Irene Himona, analyst at Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull securities
house, in London.
Opec has at least achieved a short-term aim of improving oil prices, even
though many buyers are steering clear of the market until some of the
uncertainty is cleared away. If the organisation is unable to follow through
with any attempt to staunch the flow of its own oil and make room for Iraq
in the market, it could face a price collapse of several dollars.
However, its hands will remain effectively tied until it knows the terms of
any oil accord reached between Iraq and the UN. The Iraqi government is
still considering a draft deal reached last week, but there are many
technical details to be clarified.
Oil prices collapsed over the weekend and fell further on Monday following
the Baghdad government's expression of willingness to comply with UN
requirements over monitoring of missile sites. Although this is not directly
connected to the oil talks it is seen as improving the chances of agreement
being reached on a Dollars 1.6bn oil sale to pay for humanitarian aid.
One problem for Opec is that its members are all producing at more than
their current output ceilings and Kuwait is steadily building up its own
production after refusing to sign on to the organisation's last accord.
Opec's overall ceiling is 23.6m barrels a day but the flow of members' oil
is believed to have reached between 24.3m b/d and 24.5m b/d.
A first step for Mr Ping would be to persuade members to improve their
performances on adherence to the existing quotas. Traders point out that
Opec countries have mostly sold their crude for August and would be unable
to cut exports immediately. But they could trim production in order to stick
to their quotas from September.
Towards the end of the year oil demand picks up for seasonal reasons, which
makes the timing of any Iraqi oil deal crucial.
Fourth quarter demand for Opec oil could be as high as 26m b/d, which gives
the organisation room to accommodate some 500,000 b/d from Iraq as well as
higher Kuwaiti output, as long as the other member countries keep production
within their current quotas.
The real haggling for Opec will come if the Iraqis win agreement for an
earlier return to the market. That could result in other member countries
having to cut their existing output if they wanted to prevent prices
collapsing. But Opec has had so little success in its past few meetings -
with most countries continuing to produce flat-out regardless of their
agreed ceilings - that it will be extremely difficult to apportion cuts.
'After the mess they made of the last meeting, I don't think they would be
able to convince even the hall porter in the Vienna Marriott if they say
they're cutting back immediately,' said one trader with a major oil company.
Other analysts point out that the organisation needs to develop a game plan
for dealing with the situation after the return of Iraq to the market, as
the Dollars 1.6bn one-off sale could be followed by a wider lifting of
sanctions.
'They have no aces up their sleeves, but they need to remove the uncertainty
over what they might do when Iraq comes back,' said Mr Joe Stanislaw,
analyst with Cambridge Energy Research Associates in Boston.
With oil prices having dropped by about Dollars 3 a barrel over the past
month, the producers' cartel needs to reach swift agreement on any action it
can take to support the market, even if that only involves some smart
talking.

FT  21 JUL 93 / Government Bonds: Investors shrug off Maastricht vote and
gilt auction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN and KAREN ZAGOR
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK government bond market took the details of the forthcoming gilts
auction and nervousness over tomorrow's Maastricht vote in its stride.
Short-dated maturities held steady with the declining hopes of a further cut
in base rates countered by the impact of a firm pound. Middle-dated
maturities shrugged off the impending supply pressure from next week's
auction.
The Bank of England said it would auction Pounds 3.25bn of 7 per cent stock
dated November 2001. The stock will be payable in three instalments and be
free of tax to overseas residents.
The new issue was trading between 18.08 and 18.10 on a when-issued basis
yesterday. The size of the auction came as no surprise, but the market had
predicted a maturity of 2000.
There was some additional encouragement in a fall in M4, the broad measure
of money. The figure came in at minus 0.2 per cent on the month against
expectations of a rise of 0.5 per cent. The fall was, in fact, a reflection
of high government borrowing, which has been draining cash from bank
accounts.
At the ultra-long end, the continuing belief in enduring low inflation saw
the 8 3/4 per cent stock dated 2017 rise  7/32 to 108 17/32 with investors
seizing on any weakness to buy in.
SWIRLING speculation on money supply figures and views on today's interest
rate signals sent German government debt prices lower yesterday. German bund
futures for September traded on Liffe fell 0.16 to 96.08.
Initially, a rumour swept through the market that the German M3 money supply
figure, which is expected today, would come in at 7.2 per cent, far higher
than the target range of 6.5 per cent. If that were the case, the
inflationary pressures would push back hopes for a rate cut.
The market also focused on a long interview with Mr Lothar Muller, a
Bundesbank council member, who poured cold water on ideas of future rate
cuts. Mr Muller has already spoken out against the practice of relaxing
monetary policy without evidence of easing in the recession.
Finally, the two-day reverse repo carried out on Monday at 7.15 per cent was
seen as setting a floor for short-term rates. Dealers said, although the
Bundesbank could have carried out the same operation with T-Bills, that
would have signalled a lower floor of 7 per cent. Economists expect a tight
repo of around 7.18 per cent today. This will drain money from the system
following the recent intervention to support the heavy selling of D-Marks
for French francs.
ITALIAN government bonds were hit by a weak lira and a row brewing between
the central bank and the government.
The currency is suffering because of the government's desire to cut interest
rates further. Mr Carlo Ciampi's government is at odds with the central
bank, which says it should not.
Further interest rate cuts will help the short end of the yield curve.
However, political uncertainty is never encouraging for the long end, and
the 10-year futures contract for September traded on Liffe slipped 0.21 to
104.44.
US TREASURY prices slipped as the market digested comments by Mr Alan
Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, and players started to hedge
against an expected Dollars 3bn paper issue by the Tennessee Valley
Authority.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was  5/32 lower at
107 7/16 , yielding 6.550 per cent. At the short end, the two-year note was
down  5/32 , to yield 4.056 per cent.
In testimony before Congress, Mr Greenspan said this year's inflation news
was disappointing and added that further progress on inflation would not be
easy. 'Inflation expectations, at least by some measures, appear to have
tilted upward this year, possibly contributing to price pressures,' he said.
His comments triggered fears that the Fed might tighten short-term rates to
muffle inflation, which hurt shorter-dated maturities.
There was little reaction to the unchanged June housing starts numbers. May
housing starts were revised to show a rise of 4 per cent.
The Federal Reserve intervened in the open market to arrange Dollars 2.5bn
of customer repurchase agreements when Fed funds were trading at 3 1/16 per
cent. Fed funds ended the day at 3 per cent.

FT  21 JUL 93 / International Capital Markets: European futures links
encounter local opposition - Exchanges are slow to give up autonomy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The ambitions of Europe's thriving derivatives exchanges have spawned plans
to forge links aimed at a broader investment base. However, in practice,
exchanges are finding it more difficult than imagined to sacrifice total
autonomy.
In the past decade, 18 derivatives exchanges have sprung up in Europe. They
support 98 different futures and options contracts, excluding options on
individual shares.
Many of the smaller exchanges have successful stock derivatives - index
futures and equity options - even though their underlying stock markets are
quite illiquid, and barely contemplating international expansion.
The best example of cross-border links is Fex, an alliance of European
derivatives exchanges that plans electronic connections across borders
between London, Stockholm, Zurich, Amsterdam and Vienna. Budding exchanges
in Spain and Italy hope to join the group. Germany's Deutsche Terminborse
(DTB) and France's Matif are also discussing a link.
Amsterdam's electronic derivatives exchange, the European Options Exchange
(EOE), and the London arm of its Swedish counterpart, OMLX, have already
linked systems in the first stage of the Fex agreement, allowing joint
access to their respective stock index products. To date, it is the only
such alliance successfully consummated.
The pace of this co-operation may be checked by the realities of joint
ventures, including protectionist concerns from the exchanges' less robust
cash markets.
The board of Soffex, Switzerland's futures and options exchange, dealt a
blow to the Fex agreement last week when it ordered work on cross-border
links and foreign memberships to stop. Switzerland is struggling to
construct a national electronic stock market (the EBS) to replace its three
regional exchanges.
The three big Swiss banks which dominate Soffex's board are expected to
govern the EBS when it emerges. Analysts say the banks may have stifled
Soffex out of fear that international links would bleed away Switzerland's
stock market to London. 'The banks may see the need to build up a good Swiss
stock market (before opening it up to foreigners). By putting off the Soffex
links, they may be buying time,' says Mr Ruben Lee, managing director of the
UK consulting firm, Oxford Finance Group.
The price of delaying co-operation, Mr Lee says, is, increased competition.
London already accounts for about one-fifth of Swiss stock trading, and
Liffe, London's futures and options exchange, has been singularly successful
at capturing foreign currency-denominated financial contracts.
The decision to constrain the derivatives market long enough for the cash
market to catch up has serious implications for Soffex and its Fex partners.
Soffex's volume is posting records, but with the electronic link, the
exchange 'would have had a lot more market-makers, and a lot more liquidity,
and we would have created business for our partner exchanges as well,' said
Mr Daniel Grossreider, Soffex vice-president.
Other planned links are proving difficult to consummate. By co-operating,
exchanges lose some control over their own business. Liffe and the Chicago
Board of Trade last month abandoned discussions to share government debt
contracts.
The larger exchanges are turning toward joint marketing efforts in
preference to links, viewing them as easier and more practical. The smaller
derivatives exchanges, however, have more to gain from links, since they
have fewer overlapping members.

FT  21 JUL 93 / International Bonds: Long-dated D-Mark offering attracts
foreign interest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN currencies provided the talking point of the international bond
market yesterday, as market participants focused on a substantial long-dated
D-Mark issue from LKB Baden Wurttemberg Finance and an aggressively-priced
Eurolira deal from GECC.
Recent tensions within the European exchange rate mechanism and a shortage
of 10-year D-Mark denominated Eurobonds provided the main impetus for the
launch of LKB Baden Wurttemberg Finance's DM1bn deal, according to Deutsche
Bank, book-runner for the issue. It said currency strains were likely to
prompt more D-Mark issues.
The bonds were sold mainly to foreign investors who want to hold D-Mark
assets in view of the recent turbulence in the foreign exchange markets.
The LKB Baden Wurttemberg bonds, which have a triple-A rating, were priced
to yield 18 basis points over the 6 3/4 per cent bund due 2003, providing an
annual yield of 6.705 per cent.
By late afternoon, the bonds were trading within fees at 99.36 bid, having
kept the yield spread of 18 basis points over the bund.
The launch of yet another aggressively-priced Eurolira deal - a L200bn,
10-year issue from GECC - drew a stream of fairly caustic comments from
rival Eurolira specialists.
Credito Italiano, book-runner to the deal, said there was still good retail
demand in Switzerland and the Benelux countries for Eurolira bonds, given
the relative stability of the currency and the prospect of falling interest
rates.
The deal comes hard on the heels of a tightly-priced issue from the World
Bank, which yielded 9.47 per cent at full fees. GECC's bonds have a coupon
of 9.55 per cent and yielded 9.51 per cent at full fees.
Market participants complained that the yield pick-up of four basis points
over the World Bank issue looked mean, while even Credito Italiano conceded
that the deal was 'on the aggressive side'.
Abbey National, the UK financial services group, announced yesterday it
hoped to tap the nascent Dragon bond market, adding another corporate name
to the steady list of borrowers in south-east Asia.
The bank, which has a Aa2/AA credit rating, is expected to raise between
Dollars 200m and Dollars 300m in the three- to five-year maturity range.
Abbey National said it was keen to broaden its investor base in Asia using a
Dragon bond, an international bond offering listed in Hong Kong or
Singapore, and aimed at investors in the region.
Standard &amp; Poor's, the US rating agency, has improved its long-term outlook
on the Peoples Republic of China to positive from stable.
The agency confirmed China's BBB foreign currency debt rating and its A-2
short term currency debt rating. However, the agency noted: 'Recent
political events neither ensure that reform will proceed without
interruption nor clarify long-standing questions about China's potentially
difficult leadership succession.'

LOWER unit costs and a higher gold price helped the three gold mines in the
Johannesburg Consolidated Investments group to a strong advance in profits
for the three months ended June, compared with the preceding quarter.
After tax and capital spending, group profits rose by 61 per cent to R58.8m
(Dollars 17.6m).
Western Areas lifted earnings by 102 per cent to R22.2m after tax and
capital expenditure; Randfontein rose by 26.7 per cent to R34.4m; and Joel
made a profit of R2.2m.
The average yield of the mines rose for the sixth consecutive quarter to
4.81 grammes/tonne while unit costs fell to R27,583/kg.
The average gold price received rose by 4.2 per cent to R35,181 per kg.
For the first time, JCI disclosed its hedging activities. The three mines
have hedged about 50 per cent of their production in the year ahead at
prices of R36,300 to R37,400 per kg. The current gold price is about R42,440
per kg.
Mr Kennedy Maxwell, chairman of the gold and uranium division, said that if
current gold prices were maintained, the portion of production hedged would
come down 'quite considerably'.

Dollars 702m to Dollars 658m, writes Martin Dickson.
The results were in line with its recent warning of lower-than-expected
profits, due to weak economies, a new pricing policy and a lack of product

CAPITAL CITIES/ABC, the television and newspaper group that controls the ABC
Television network, reported second-quarter net income of Dollars 151m, or
Dollars 9.21 a share, up from Dollars 147.5m, or Dollars 8.84, a year ago.
Net revenue rose to Dollars 1.44bn from Dollars 1.39bn. Operating income was
almost flat at Dollars 270.7m against Dollars 268.7m.
Broadcasting revenues rose 5 per cent to Dollars 1.18bn from Dollars 1.12bn,
while operating income edged 3 per cent higher to Dollars 244.5m from
Dollars 236.6m. Earnings for ABC Television fell.
The company blamed the fall on weak advertising demand and provisions for
job cuts. Operating income from television stations and radio, however,
increased significantly.
Publishing revenues fell 6 per cent to Dollars 255.9m from Dollars 273.5m,
and operating income from the business dropped 9 per cent to Dollars 36.3m
from Dollars 40.1m.
First-half results were distorted by extraordinary charges this year and
accounting charges in 1992. Including these items, first-half net income was
Dollars 210.2m, or Dollars 12.77, on revenues of Dollars 2.62bn against
earnings of Dollars 46m, or Dollars 2.72, on revenues of Dollars 2.49bn in
1992.
Stripping out an extraordinary charge, consolidated net income rose to
Dollars 222.4m from Dollars 189.3m. Operating income rose to Dollars 411.6m
from Dollars 366.6m.

UNITED Technologies, the US high-technology group, yesterday reported a 12
per cent drop in second-quarter net income as sharply lower profits at its
Pratt &amp; Whitney aero-engine business offset improved performances in most
other parts of the group.
Net income was Dollars 130m, or 89 cents a share, compared with Dollars
148m, or Dollars 1.03, for the same period of last year. Revenues were
Dollars 5.6bn, down from Dollars 5.7bn.
Pratt, which has suffered from the downturn in the airline industry,
reported operating profits of Dollars 6m, down from Dollars 122m a year ago.
Revenues dropped from Dollars 1.8bn to Dollars 1.7bn.
Mr Robert Daniell, UTC chairman, said Pratt was showing an improvement from
the first quarter, with an increase in commercial engine parts orders in the
first six months.
UTC's flight division, which includes Sikorsky, the helicopter manufacturer,
produced operating profits of Dollars 96m, up from Dollars 63m, on revenues
of Dollars 898m, down from Dollars 983m.
Otis, the elevator group, made Dollars 98m (Dollars 84m) on revenues of
Dollars 1.14bn (Dollars 1.12bn). Carrier, the air conditioner company, made
Dollars 85m (Dollars 93m), on revenues of Dollars 1.24bn (Dollars 1.27bn).
Automotive made Dollars 53m (Dollars 42m), on revenues of Dollars 640m
(Dollars 633m).
For the six months UTC had net income of Dollars 194m, or Dollars 1.31 a
share, compared with Dollars 242m, or Dollars 1.79 last year before
accounting changes.

MARTIN Marietta, the US defence contractor which took over GE Aerospace in
April, recorded a 25 per cent rise in second-quarter net income due to a
first-time contribution from its acquisition.
Net income rose to Dollars 124m, from Dollars 99m in the second quarter of
1992, on sales up from Dollars 1.6bn to Dollars 2.6bn. Earnings per share on
a fully diluted basis fell to Dollars 1.98 from Dollars 2.06, reflecting an
increase of 14.5m in the shares outstanding as a result of a convertible
stock issue made in connection with the GE transaction.
New debt associated with the takeover took gearing to 41 per cent by the end
of June, which the company described as 'manageable'.
For the first half, before the effect of a change in accounting for
retirees' health benefits, post-tax profits were Dollars 200m, or Dollars
3.62, compared with Dollars 174m, or Dollars 3.57, in the first six months
of 1992.
Around Dollars 1.2bn of sales in the second quarter came from the company's
new electronics division, forged after the takeover. This unit achieved an
operating margin of 9 per cent, compared with a 10 per cent margin in the
space division, which recorded sales of Dollars 850m.

McGRAW-HILL, the US-based publishing and information services group,
reported a 17.3 per cent rise in second-quarter net income, buoyed by a jump
in profits at Standard &amp; Poor's, the credit rating agency.
McGraw-Hill raised net income to Dollars 43.18m, or 88 cents a share, up
from Dollars 36.79m, or 75 cents, in the same period of last year, on
revenues up 1.4 per cent to Dollars 490.9m.
The group's financial services business produced a 25.1 per cent increase in
operating income on a 14.5 per cent rise in revenue, thanks to Standard &amp;
Poor's, which continued to benefit from new issues volume in the US and
international securities markets.
The JJ Kenny business also showed 'fine growth' as investments in technology
led to productivity gains.
Information and publication services saw an 8.2 per cent drop in revenue and
a 20.6 per cent fall in operating profits. Advertising at Business Week
magazine fell 16 per cent in April and May, and did not begin to regain
momentum until June.
Educational and professional publishing suffered a Dollars 2.1m drop in
operating profits, and broadcasting was down 12.7 per cent.
However, the group's share of the MacMillan/McGraw-Hill School Publishing
Company's profits rose 72.4 per cent, to Dollars 11.2m.
Mr Joseph Dionne, chairman, said the slow growth of the US economy would
mean a 'challenging second half for some of our businesses, particularly in
advertising and construction.
'But continued growth in financial services from new financing, new products
and global expansion should keep us moving ahead.'
For the first half the company reported income up 18.9 per cent at Dollars
58.43m on revenues 2 per cent ahead at Dollars 957.8m. Earnings per share
were Dollars 1.19, against Dollars 1.00.

GUANGZHOU Shipyard International yesterday came to the Hong Kong Stock
Exchange for HKDollars 307m (USDollars 39m) with an issue which will result
in 42.7 per cent of the company being sold to the public.
The shipyard is the third of nine Chinese state enterprises to be listed on
the exchange.
GSI will issue 145m 'H' shares at HKDollars 2.08 a share to give a
prospective price earnings ratio of 8.3 on estimated 1993 net earnings or
not less than Yn85m (Dollars 14.8m). In addition, the company will issue
12.4m 'H' shares to independent third parties.
Proceeds will be used to increase working capital. GSI's principal
activities include shipbuilding, container manufacturing and ship repair.
The company - which builds naval as well as civilian vessels - is one of the
eight largest shipyards in China and is controlled by the China State
Shipbuilding Corporation.
The company can build ships up to 40,000 dwt and has an annual capacity of
150,000 dwt; it has plans to increase ship size to 60,000 dwt and annual
capacity to 200,000 dwt. GSI's annual container manufacturing capacity is
18,000 TEUs (twenty feet equivalent units). Most are exported.
GSI made a net profit of Yn67.6m for 1992, up 42.3 per cent. Turnover was
Yn848.6m, against Yn586.4m.
According to the company's prospectus, dividends paid to foreign investors
will be subject to a 20 per cent withholding tax. Last year GSI had net
tangible assets of Yn640.9m.

ELI LILLY, the US pharmaceuticals group which went through a shake-up of top
management last month, reported a 6 per cent advance in sales for the second
quarter of 1993, compared with the same period a year earlier, confounding
the more gloomy market predictions.
Net income rose to Dollars 346.8m, or Dollars 1.18 a share, from Dollars
340.2m, or Dollars 1.16. The result was ahead of market expectations,
although still below the Dollars 1.23 a share achieved in the first quarter
of this year.
Sales totalled Dollars 1.56bn, compared with Dollars 1.48bn in the second
quarter of 1992, led by growth in international markets. The rise came in
spite of moves by Germany to contain spending on drugs, the company said.
Pharmaceutical sales in the US were dampened by the effects of Medicaid
rebates, the growth of institutional buying of drugs through managed-care
programmes, and continued competition in anti-infective drugs.
Lilly has been hit by concern over its failure to produce new big-selling
drugs, which contributed to the resignation last month of Mr Vaughn Bryson,
chief executive.
Spending on research and development rose to Dollars 470m in the second
quarter, up 11 per cent on a year earlier. The company said this reflected
'the increased number of compounds that are entering the final phases of
clinical research'.
Before the effect of accounting changes, net income for the first half fell
by Dollars 102m to just over Dollars 1bn, pushing earnings per share down
from Dollars 2.66 to Dollars 2.45.
However, after accounting changes, earnings rose from Dollars 2.26 to
Dollars 2.42 a share.

<TEXT>
A US-New Zealand consortium has paid NZDollars 328m (USDollars 179m) for New
Zealand Rail. It plans eventually to float some of the company - possibly 40
per cent - on the local stock market.
Ms Ruth Richardson, New Zealand's minister of finance, said the deal, which
includes the inter-island ferry service but excludes NZ Rail running track,
is after NZDollars 62m of debt repayment.
The consortium consists of Wisconsin Central Transportation, the biggest
railway operator in the US, Berkshire Partners of Boston, a US equity
investment group, and Fay, Richwhite, the New Zealand merchant bank.
Fay, Richwhite said the flotation was planned for 1996 at the earliest once
NZ Rail was able to demonstrate a consistent earnings performance under
private ownership. Last year it made an after-tax profit of NZDollars 36.3m.
Wisconsin Central operates across 2,000 miles of track in the US and Canada.
Mr Ed Burkhardt, president, said his company intended to remain a long term
investor in NZ Rail which would roughly double the size of Wisconsin
Central.
He said there were similarities, as his company's focus was on the haulage
of forestry, coal, pulp and paper and dairy products.
Mr Burkhardt said employee numbers at NZ Rail were 5,000, down from 27,000
in 1984. He said that while Wisconsin Central had 1,050 staff the companies
were different. His company did not run a large ferry service or passenger
trains which were more labour intensive.
The New Zealand government will retain the right to introduce another
operator on the railway line if freight and passenger traffic falls below 50
per cent of current volumes.
Ms Richardson said NZ Rail would continue to receive a government subsidy at
around the current level of NZDollars 28m a year. NZR also receives a
regional bodies subsidy. She said these would assure continuation of the
passenger service. NZ Rail would need a NZDollars 600m capital injection by
the end of the decade and another NZDollars 800m by 2010.

ROCKWELL International, the California-based high technology group, recorded
a 20 per cent increase in third-quarter net income and forecast that
full-year earnings per share would be at least 15 per cent higher than last
year.
The group reported net income of Dollars 147.2m, or 66 cents a share,
compared with Dollars 122.6m, or 55 cents, in the same period of last year.
Sales rose from Dollars 2.7bn to Dollars 2.8bn.
Mr Donald Beall, chairman, said third-quarter figures were ahead of the
company's expectations, with three of its four business units reporting
substantial earnings increases - aerospace and automotive were each up 38
per cent while electronics, the group's largest business, was up 28 per
cent.
The fourth, graphics, had a loss, due to 'continued depressed worldwide
newspaper printing press markets'.
The company said, however, that it was beginning to see signs of an upturn
in demand for large newspaper presses.
For the first nine months, net income was Dollars 411.9m, or Dollars 1.87 a
share, up 19 per cent over the Dollars 344.9m, or Dollars 1.54, reported the
previous year prior to accounting changes.
Mr Beall said the third-quarter figures demonstrated performance
improvements through company-wide initiatives in 'progressive management
practices'.
Aerospace's return on sales was up 3 percentage points, while electronics
and automotive were up almost 2 percentage points.

LOWER unit costs and a higher gold price helped the three gold mines in the
Johannesburg Consolidated Investments group to a strong advance in profits
for the three months ended June, compared with the preceding quarter.
After tax and capital spending, group profits rose by 61 per cent to R58.8m
(Dollars 17.6m).
Western Areas pushed up its earnings by 102 per cent to R22.2m after tax and
capital expenditure; Randfontein increased its profits by 26.7 per cent to
R34.4m; and Joel made a profit of R2.2m.
The average yield of the mines rose for the sixth consecutive quarter to
4.81 grammes/tonne while unit costs fell to R27,583/kg.
The average gold price received rose by 4.2 per cent to R35,181 per kg.
One result of the better price was that employees received, for the first
time, a metal price bonus.
Taken together with cost containment bonuses, the group paid out bonuses
totalling R8.1m during the three months.
A second result was that JCI chose, for the first time, to disclose the
extent of its hedging activities.
Mr Kennedy Maxwell, chairman of the gold and uranium division, said
yesterday that, given the reversal over the past few months in the bullion
price trend, shareholders were obviously anxious to know the extent to which
mines had made forward sales.
The figures reveal that the three mines have hedged about 50 per cent of
their production in the year ahead at prices of R36,300 to R37,400 per kg.
The current gold price is about R42,440 per kg.
Mr Maxwell said that if current gold prices were maintained, the portion of
production hedged in future would come down 'quite considerably'.

CUNO, North America's sixth largest newsprint producer, was profitable in
the second quarter with higher shipments, slightly better prices and lower
interest costs, writes Robert Gibbens in Montreal.
Net profit was CDollars 800,000 (USDollars 625,000) for the three months,
against a loss of Dollars 19m. Sales were Dollars 134m, up 26 per cent. The
performance has led to a much reduced six-month loss of Dollars 3.5m,
against one of Dollars 31.1m a year earlier. Half-year sales rose 23 per
cent to Dollars 262m.
The company went public last year when the Chicago Tribune sold a majority
interest. Its eastern Canada mills are leaders in the production of
recycled-content newsprint.

forming an alliance aimed at the Asia media market with Telstra, Australia's
biggest telephone company, Reuter reports from Canberra.
Industry sources said the state-run Telstra has informally advised the
Australian government that the alliance would pursue investments in such
services as pay television and home shopping.
This is the third recent deal between News Corp and Telstra. They plan to
take a substantial stake in Seven Network, the Australian television
operator: and they are also in a consortium bidding to operate pay
television in Australia.
Any alliance would combine the expertise of Telstra with News Corp's media
experience and access to TV material.
News Corp owns newspapers, magazines, the US-based Fox and its subsidiaries
Fox Network and Twentieth Century Fox plus 50 per cent of BSkyB, the UK
satellite broadcaster.

FT  21 JUL 93 / International Company News: PepsiCo ahead 13% at Dollars

PEPSICO, the US food and soft drinks group, yesterday reported a 13 per cent
increase in second-quarter net income, with strong growth in its snack foods
and beverage business more than offsetting lower profits on the restaurants
side.
The company reported net income of Dollars 426.8m, or 53 cents a share, up
from Dollars 378.8m, or 47 cents, in the same period of last year. Net sales
rose 15 per cent to Dollars 5.89bn.
For the first six months the group reported net income of Dollars 687m, or
85 cents, compared with Dollars 613m, or 76 cents, before accounting changes
in the same period of 1992.
Pepsi said that in the latest quarter its international operating profit
rose 32 per cent. Excluding acquisitions within the last year, sales and
operating profit improved 8 per cent and 11 per cent respectively.
Mr Wayne Calloway, chairman, said he was pleased the company managed to
achieve double-digit earnings per share growth, on top of a 21 per cent
increase in the same period of 1992, despite the cost of a new initiative at
its Pizza Hut restaurant chain.
Worldwide restaurant earnings dropped 5 per cent to Dollars 166.3m on sales
12 per cent ahead. Earnings at Pizza Hut dropped 15 per cent to Dollars
66.5m, with both US and international profits down. The fall in US profits
was due partly to the launch of the new Bigfoot Pizza, a larger, more
value-oriented dish, while the international side suffered from continued
volume declines in Australia and losses in Spain.
Kentucky Fried Chicken saw earnings drop 15 per cent to Dollars 42.4m.
However, snack food profits rose 18 per cent to Dollars 276.3m on a 21 per
cent increase in sales, and beverage earnings rose 18 per cent to Dollars
341.5m on sales up 13 per cent.
The product tampering hoax in the US, where syringes were alleged to have
been found in Pepsi cans, occured after the end of the quarter.

HONEYWELL, the US electronic control systems group, reported a drop in net
income and revenues for the second quarter.
Sales were Dollars 1.45bn, down from Dollars 1.49bn in the same period last
year. Net income was Dollars 71.4m, or 53 cents a share, including an
after-tax gain of Dollars 13.9m, or 10 cents, from the settlement of a
lawsuit with Unisys. The gain was offset by special charges of Dollars 13.3m
after taxes to improve productiv-ity.
In the same period last year, net income was Dollars 81.8m, or 58 cents a
share, including Dollars 7.4m, or 6 cents, after-tax from litigation
settlements.
Second-quarter operating profit, excluding special charges, was Dollars
131.7m, compared with Dollars 152.3m last year.
'We are delivering solid financial performance in the face of very difficult
business conditions worldwide,' said Mr Michael Bonsignore, chairman and
chief executive.
In addition to a cyclical decline in the commercial aviation industry, the
company's difficulties have been compounded by the deepening recession in
Europe, especially in Germany, he added.
'Despite the difficult environment, we expanded research and development
investment by 15 per cent,' Mr Bonsignore said. During the quarter,
Honeywell purchased Dollars 64m in shares as part of its five-year, Dollars
600m share buy-back programme.
Honeywell's space and aviation business was down sharply in the quarter,
with operating profit of Dollars 48.5m on sales of Dollars 424.7m, compared
with an operating profit of Dollars 61.4m on sales of Dollars 460.9m in the
same period last year.
First-half income was Dollars 128.7m, or 95 cents a share, against Dollars
50.7m, or 36 cents, last year. Sales were Dollars 2.89bn, against Dollars
2.97bn a year earlier.

FT  21 JUL 93 / International Company News: Amdahl loss worse than expected
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AMDAHL reported heavier than expected losses for the second fiscal quarter
as its revenues dropped by one-third.
The US mainframe computer manufacturer said poor economic conditions,
particularly in Europe, and a trend toward decentralised computer systems
had reduced the volume of its business.
Net losses for the quarter were Dollars 23.7m, or 21 cents a share, on
revenues of Dollars 463.2m against net income of Dollars 16.9m, or 15 cents,
on higher revenues of Dollars 693m in the same period last year.
First-half losses were Dollars 263.4m, or Dollars 2.32, including after-tax
charges of Dollars 177.4m in the first quarter, when the company cut back
manufacturing capacity with the loss of 1,000 jobs. In the first half of
1992, net income was Dollars 21.3m, or 19 cents. First-half sales were
Dollars 843.9m, against Dollars 1.19bn last year.
Amdahl said it had cut costs during the quarter by reducing its workforce
and closing surplus manufacturing facilities. It also reduced inventories
and cut capital spending.
The company added that the shift away from central mainframe computers
towards networks of smaller computers was more pronounced in some industry
sectors than others. It said a customer survey suggested growth in mainframe
computer sales would vary widely depending on the business involved.
Last month Amdahl and Electronic Data Systems formed a joint venture
software company, the Antares Alliance Group, which is working on software
that will speed the development of applications programs.
Last week, Amdahl also announced an agreement with Fujitsu, the Japanese
computer manufacturer, and ICL of the UK to collaborate in the development
of a common UNIX operating system for the companies' computer products.
Fujitsu holds an equity stake in Amdahl and owns ICL.

<TEXT>
WARNER-LAMBERT, the large US drugs group, reported a 6 per cent improvement
in second-quarter earnings to Dollars 189.9m, or Dollars 1.40 a share, on
sales which rose 6 per cent to Dollars 1.45bn.
A year earlier, the company earned Dollars 177.8m, or Dollars 1.32, on sales
of Dollars 1.37bn.
A 29 per cent advance in consumer sector sales outside the US offset a 2 per
cent decline in the US and a 6 per cent drop in worldwide pharmaceutical
sales to Dollars 532m from Dollars 566m. US pharmaceutical sales were hit by
the loss of some Dollars 34m in sales related to manufacturing and
regulatory compliance issues in Puerto Rico.
Mr Melvin Goodes, chairman and chief executive, said the company was close
to reaching a settlement with the Food and Drug Administration over its
manufacturing plants, mainly in Puerto Rico.
Earlier this month, the company said the planned settlement, in the form of
a consent decree, would reduce earnings.
'At this point, its financial impact appears to be manageable,' said Mr
Goodes. 'However, coupled with the delay in Cognex (a treatment for
Alzheimer's disease) approval, it will undercut our ability to generate
double-digit earnings growth for the year.'
For the first half, Warner-Lambert posted net income of Dollars 372m, or
Dollars 2.75 on sales of Dollars 2.78bn, against Dollars 341.5m, or Dollars
2.54, on sales of Dollars 2.68bn.

CINCINNATI MILACRON, the US machine tools and plastics machinery group,
yesterday announced more than doubled second-quarter operating earnings, but
expressed concern about the condition of US and European economies.
Operating net rose from Dollars 2.77m, or 10 cents a share, to Dollars
5.83m, or 18 cents. The latest figure excludes a Dollars 4.4m charge for
early extinguishment of debt, while the 1992 figure excludes a Dollars
700,000 gain from a loss carry-forward.
For the first six months, operating net earnings jumped from Dollars 3.88m,
or 14 cents a share, to Dollars 10.1m, or 33 cents. However, the latest
figure excludes both the Dollars 4.4m charge and a charge of Dollars 52.1m
for accounting changes. The 1992 figure excludes a Dollars 900,000 gain from
carry-forwards.
Revenues jumped from Dollars 185.6m to Dollars 237.2m in the latest quarter,
taking the six-month total to Dollars 458.2m, against Dollars 345.6m.
Mr Daniel Meyer, chairman, said Milacron's first-half results were on
target.

<TEXT>
MONSANTO, the US chemicals group, yesterday unveiled a sharp rise in
second-quarter earnings led by a strong performance by its agricultural
businesses.
This more than offset a decline in underlying operating income from its
chemical segment and lower operating income from its NutraSweet artificial
sweetener operations.
Net income was Dollars 200m, or Dollars 1.66 a share, on sales of Dollars
2.23bn, compared with Dollars 105m, or 86 cents, on sales of Dollars 2.05bn
last year. Operating income climbed to Dollars 326m in the latest quarter
from Dollars 185m.
Operating income from the agricultural group rose more than 50 per cent to
Dollars 258m, adjusted for a pre-tax charge of Dollars 19m last year.
Mr Richard Mahoney, chairman and chief executive, said: 'The single largest
contributor to worldwide agricultural growth this year has been the rapid
adoption of minimum tillage techniques by farmers, a trend which was further
accelerated by exceptional weather conditions.'
Agricultural sales grew to Dollars 743m from Dollars 532m.
Operating income from Monsanto's chemical group rose to Dollars 75m from
Dollars 59m, but the 1992 quarter included a pre-tax extraordinary charge of
Dollars 41m.
The company blamed weak economic conditions in Europe and Japan for the
performance of its chemical operations. Chemical sales slipped to Dollars
933m from Dollars 967m.
The Searle pharmaceutical unit posted an operating loss of Dollars 37m,
against a loss of Dollars 53m last year, while sales rose to Dollars 368m
from Dollars 314m.
NutraSweet recorded operating income of Dollars 42m on sales of Dollars
186m, compared with Dollars 48m on sales of Dollars 232m.
First-half net income was Dollars 341m, or Dollars 2.83, on sales of Dollars
4.17bn, against a net deficit of Dollars 283m, or Dollars 2.30, on sales of
Dollars 4.02bn a year ago. Stripping out the impact of accounting charges,
Monsanto earned Dollars 257m in the 1992 period.

FT  21 JUL 93 / International Company News: Eli Lilly issues warning on
profits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ELI Lilly, the US drugs group, warned that profits this year were likely to
be at the lower end of most analysts' predictions and could fall in 1994.
Mr Randall Tobias, in his first presentation to analysts since taking over
as chief executive last month, said the company would have to dig deeply
into costs: 'Our overhead structure evolved during a very different era.'
Downward pressure on drugs prices and increasing research and development
costs meant that the company's 1993 earnings were likely to be at the lower
end of the Dollars 4.45-Dollars 4.75 a share predicted by analysts.
The continuation of these pressures, and the possibility of a higher tax
charge resulting from the Clinton administration's economic programme, 'will
challenge Lilly to stay even with 1993 results next year,' Mr Tobias said.
He added that the company's cash flow remained robust and its debt levels
low.
Lilly, which has suffered from the lack of successful new drugs from its
research, used the meeting to announce it had signed a licensing agreement
with Eisai of Japan.

ESC Wagons, the consortium building shuttle-train carriages for the Channel
tunnel, has raised the amount of its legal claim against TransManche-Link,
the tunnel's main contractor, writes Bernard Simon in Toronto.
Bombardier, the Canadian transport group which heads ESC, said yesterday it
was still trying to negotiate a settlement of the dispute over additional
work required to meet TML's changed specifications. But Bombardier said it
planned to press its claim in court if it did not receive 'an early and
positive reaction'.
ESC is claiming a total of FFr3.39bn (Dollars 584.5m), compared with the
FFr2bn claimed last December. The company said the difference reflected
further 'delays and disruptions resulting from TML's actions'.

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US BANK shares rose in early trading yesterday on earnings reports that
pointed to a marked recovery in the quality of real estate and commercial
loan assets, although profit-taking later left some shares down on the day.
Wells Fargo, the California-based bank hit by troubled property lending,
said net income for the second quarter rose to Dollars 149m, or Dollars 2.46
a share, compared with Dollars 82m, or Dollars 1.33, a year ago.
Although income fell and costs rose, the figures were boosted by a sharp
fall in loan-loss provisions to Dollars 140m, down from Dollars 300m last
time.
However, the company said it was still concerned about the Californian
economy. Net loan write-offs were Dollars 138m, against Dollars 184m a year
ago.
Net interest income fell to Dollars 658m from Dollars 671m as loan volume
declined slightly and interest margins remained steady. Other income rose to
Dollars 275m from Dollars 271m. Operating expenses advanced by 5 per cent,
or Dollars 25m, to Dollars 531m.
Due to lower provisions, return on equity for the period rose to 16.73 per
cent, from 12.1 per cent in the first quarter and 9.55 per cent a year ago.
Net income for the first half was Dollars 257m, or Dollars 4.18, compared
with Dollars 201m, or Dollars 3.42, last time.
Declining provisions also helped fuel a 22 per cent advance in net income
for the quarter at NationsBank, the North Carolina-based 'super-regional'
bank which has grown by acquisition into the nation's fifth largest. The
charge for credit losses fell to Dollars 110m from Dollars 150m a year ago
as net income jumped to Dollars 306m, or Dollars 1.19, from Dollars 251m, or
98 cents fully-diluted.
The advance came in spite of 'a still less-than-robust economic recovery,'
said Mr Hugh McColl, chairman. First-half net income reached Dollars 787m,
or Dollars 2.28, from Dollars 561m, or Dollars 2.22, in the first half of
1992.
Loan growth was 'exceptionally strong' during the period, the company said,
with total outstanding loans rising by Dollars 2.8bn, or 16 per cent, from
the previous quarter. Return on equity was 14.65 per cent, against 14.21 per
cent.
Banc One, the Ohio-based super-regional bank which also counts itself among
the 10 largest in the US, reported net income of Dollars 282m, or Dollars
1.01, up from Dollars 243m, or 87 cents a year earlier. First-half after-tax
profits were Dollars 569m, up from 1992's restated Dollars 425m.
Second-quarter results were lifted by a rise in the net interest margin to
6.3 per cent from 5.96 per cent.
The takeover in May of The Boston Company, a trust and investment management
company, led Mellon Bank to report second-quarter net income of Dollars 99m,
or Dollars 1.32, compared with Dollars 90m, or Dollars 1.41, after the
effect of a favourable tax position a year before (Dollars 64m, or Dollars
0.95 a share, excluding the one-off tax treatment).
Net interest revenue was Dollars 314m, up from Dollars 281m a year before,
while fee income climbed to Dollars 281m from Dollars 203m.
Leaving aside the effects of the Boston acquisition, the income figures
would have been Dollars 300m and Dollars 243m respectively. Provisions for
credit losses fell to Dollars 35m, from Dollars 50m, while return on equity
rose to 13.69 per cent from 11.37 per cent (before the one-off tax benefit).
First-half net income was Dollars 133m, or Dollars 1.63, down from Dollars
176m, or Dollars 2.77, last year.

Dollars 775m charge

MERCK, the world's biggest drugs group, yesterday said it was taking a
pre-tax Dollars 775m second-quarter charge to cover voluntary redundancies
and other cost-cutting measures.
The group added that it would cut about 2,100 jobs by the end of this year,
about 1,100 more than previously announced.
Stripping out the charges, Merck posted a 9 per cent rise in underlying
second-quarter profits to Dollars 693.6m, or 61 cents a share, against
Dollars 643m, or 56 cents, last year. Including restructuring charges, Merck
recorded net income of Dollars 172.6m, or 15 cents, in the 1993 quarter.
Sales rose 8 per cent to Dollars 2.57bn from Dollars 2.37bn.
The second-quarter figures were in line with analysts' expectations,
although below Merck's traditional double-digit earnings growth.
Nevertheless, Wall Street was enthusiastic about the restructuring plans,
and at mid-session shares in Merck were Dollars 1 3/4 higher at Dollars 33
1/2 in a declining market.
Merck said it had cut about 2,100 jobs since March, significantly above its
earlier short-term goal of reducing its work force by 1,000.
Many of these positions will be eliminated permanently. In the longer term,
Merck plans to continue streamlining its facilities and trimming its
workforce, mainly outside the US, starting next year.
Mr Roy Vagelos, chairman and chief executive, said the reduced employment
costs should save more than Dollars 140m annually.
For the first half, Merck posted net income of Dollars 786.3m, or 69 cents,
against Dollars 740.3m, or 64 cents, a year ago.
Excluding the restructuring charges in 1993 and charges for accounting
changes in 1992, earnings rose 9 per cent to Dollars 1.31bn from Dollars
1.2bn.

FT  21 JUL 93 / International Company News: Income from trading main factor
behind rise at Chemical Bank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RECORD income from trading was the main factor behind a 59 per cent rise in
net income at Chemical Bank in the second quarter, to Dollars 381m, writes
Richard Waters.
In common with other big US banks, Chemical reported a sharp rise in income
from trading in foreign exchange and other financial markets, up at Dollars
298m from Dollars 170m in the same period in 1992.
The bank also recorded a 7 per cent rise in net interest income, to Dollars
1.175bn.
Provisions for credit losses rose to Dollars 363m, from Dollars 345m a year
ago, although provisions for the first half as a whole were down at Dollars
675m, from Dollars 720m in the corresponding period.
Mr Walter Shipley, president, said that the bank had seen a 'sharp
improvement in credit quality' during the quarter, with non-performing
assets falling by Dollars 843m.
Second quarter earnings per share were Dollars 1.39, against 83 cents in the
same quarter of 1993.
First half net income rose to Dollars 755m, or Dollars 2.70, from Dollars
500m, or Dollars 1.83, in the 1992 period.
Chemical estimated that its Tier 1 capital ratio had risen to 7.6 per cent
by the end of June, from 7.0 per cent at the end of the first quarter.

FT  21 JUL 93 / International Company News: Sears, Roebuck back in black
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SEARS, Roebuck yesterday said it had returned to profitability, reporting
record second-quarter earnings of Dollars 580.6m, or Dollars 1.51 a share,
excluding unusual items, compared with Dollars 325.5m, or 85 cents, for the
same quarter last year.
The diversified US group is in the middle of a restructuring, having spun
off the last of its Dean Witter Reynolds brokerage unit. It has also sold 20
per cent of Allstate Insurance, and all of the Coldwell Banker property
group.
The unusual items include a gain of Dollars 635.1m from the initial public
offering of Allstate Corp, a Dollars 145.3m charge for debt reduction, and a
Dollars 64m loss on its sale of Coldwell Banker Residential Services. If
these items were included, Sears' second-quarter earnings were Dollars
1.01bn, or Dollars 2.63 per share.
Sales from Sears' continuing operations increased 5.6 per cent to Dollars
12.16bn, from Dollars 11.51bn a year ago.
Its core retail merchandising group had second-quarter income of Dollars
162.5m, on sales from continuing operations of Dollars 6.85bn, compared with
year-ago earnings of Dollars 131.1m and sales of Dollars 6.46bn. Sears
pulled out of its loss-making catalogue business during the second quarter.
Mr Edward Brennan, chairman, said the record second quarter was the result
of the successful repositioning programme and improved operating performance
of its core businesses.
Sears' results include those of the merchandising group, the 80 per cent of
Allstate it still owns, and the Homart Development property group.
In its first publicly-reported earnings as a publicly-traded company,
Allstate announced second-quarter earnings of Dollars 396.7m, or 94 cents,
compared with Dollars 229.6m, or a pro-forma of 53 cents per share in the
second quarter last year.
Sales rose 4.2 per cent to Dollars 5.23bn, from Dollars 5.02bn last year.
Underwriting losses fell to Dollars 1.7m, down from the loss of Dollars
253.8m the second quarter of 1992. Catastrophe losses for the second quarter
were Dollars 118.6m, against Dollars 275.4m in the second quarter of 1992.
Dean Witter Discover reported second quarter income of Dollars 157.1m, up 42
per cent on a comparable basis from the second quarter of 1992. On a per
share basis the results were 92 cents, up from a pro forma 57 cents in 1992.
Second quarter revenues were Dollars 1.42bn.
The company's spin-off from Sears, Roebuck was completed June 30.

FT  21 JUL 93 / International Company News: Philip Morris falls 22% as
cigarette profits slump
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PHILIP Morris, the US food and tobacco group, yesterday announced a 22 per
cent drop in second-quarter net earnings as its US cigarette profits slumped
following April's sharp cut in the price of its Marlboro brand.
Net earnings were Dollars 1.1bn, or Dollars 1.20 a share, down from Dollars
1.35bn, or Dollars 1.48, in the same period of last year on revenues which
rose 4.2 per cent to Dollars 15.79bn.
Mr Michael Miles, chairman, said that the group's consumer businesses other
than US tobacco were continuing to enjoy solid profits group, up 13.3 per
cent for the quarter.
The company's announcement on April 2 that it would not make any US premium
brand cigarette price increases, and was cutting the price of Marlboro, led
to a reduction in wholesale inventories.
This meant a 21.5 per cent decline in second-quarter US cigarette volume to
47.5bn units. Philip Morris said that primarily due to this reduced volume,
and increased marketing expenses associated with the price cuts,
second-quarter operating income for domestic tobacco was down 53.1 per cent
at Dollars 684m.
However, market share growth in the premium segment and in discount sales
meant Philip Morris's retail share of the US tobacco market reached a record
43.6 per cent in the quarter.
The pricing strategy for premium products, and improved prices on discount
products, 'allow for future profits growth off the newly established base,'
the company said.
International tobacco operations saw operating income rise 15.6 per cent to
Dollars 577m on revenues 25 per cent ahead at Dollars 4bn. Marlboro's
international sales volume rose 2.2 per cent to 58.7bn units.
North American food operations had operating income 9.9 per cent higher at
Dollars 667m, while revenues rose 1.6 per cent to Dollars 5.4bn.
International food produced income of Dollars 269m, up 13 per cent, on
revenues 19.9 per cent ahead at Dollars 2.5bn, due primarily to acquisitions
and growth in confectionery, partly offset by currency movements.
Its Miller brewing company made Dollars 140m, up 21.7 per cent, on revenues
1.1 per cent higher at Dollars 1.2bn.
For the half year, the group reported net earnings of Dollars 2.27bn, or
Dollars 2.58, compared with Dollars 2.45bn, or Dollars 2.68, in 1992.

   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FOREIGN bank creditors of Italy's Efim state holding company should know
next week whether a majority has voted for legal action against the company,
and, possibly, the Italian government.
The vote followed a tense 3 1/2 -hour meeting of foreign bank creditors in
London last week at which bankers were asked to consider various options,
including legal action.
The increased tension between foreign bank creditors, which provided about
L3,500bn (Dollars 2.2bn) of Efim's total borrowings of about L8,800bn to
financial institutions, follows mounting dissatisfaction among creditor
banks at the failure to receive initial repayments, a year after Efim was
put into voluntary liquidation.
Shortly before initial repayments were due at the end of April, a
representative of Mr Alberto Predieri, the special administrator running
Efim, said the situation would be frozen until a dispute over swap contracts
undertaken by Efim was resolved.
The issue has since been overshadowed by the European Commission's refusal
to approve the Italian government's repayment plans. However, one banker
involved said: 'Even if the Commission gives its approval tomorrow, the
Italians will not pay us back until the swaps are sorted out.'
The dispute has incensed foreign bank creditors and raised a serious point
of principle.
Although only one transaction is involved, bankers are trying to reconstruct
whether other transactions may be at risk.

FT  21 JUL 93 / International Company News: KPN floats into land of the
giants - The disposal of the Dutch telecoms group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RONALD VAN DER KROL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
With the third tranche of the privatisation of British Telecom completed,
the next event in the world calendar of telecommunications privatisations is
likely to be the flotation of Koninklijke PTT Nederland (KPN).
The sale of the Dutch PTT, widely expected to take place in the first half
of 1994, probably in the spring, is likely to produce firsts at home and
abroad.
The company, which analysts say is worth between Fl 16bn (Dollars 8.4bn) and
Fl 22bn, will be sold in stages, with next year's tranche likely to be the
Netherlands' biggest privatisation and the first of a household name. The
Dutch government has said that it is prepared to sell two-thirds of the
company.
The KPN flotation will mark the first time that a national government in
Europe has opened up its postal operations to outside investors. Fortunately
for the Dutch state, which is seeking the highest possible price for its
shares, KPN's postal subsidiary, PTT Post, is one of only two postal
services in Europe that make a profit. The other is the British Post Office.
Although the inclusion of the Netherlands' postal operations in the
flotation is unfamiliar to most investors it is not expected to drag down
the price at which KPN is floated. This is partly because PTT Post
contributes just under 20 per cent of profits compared with 80 per cent by
PTT Telecom, the telecommunications arm which is more directly comparable
with other privatised telecommunications companies such as British Telecom.
Mr Manus Fleskens, an analyst at Barclays de Zoete Wedd in Amsterdam, noted
that the Dutch postal service was highly-automated and well-managed and
produced a consistent record of profits. 'It has good prospects for the
future, both in expanding its size of operations and its profits generally.'
Although the Netherlands has a mature telecommunications market, KPN is
regarded as a solid player because its costs are low and because its home
market is internationally-orientated, generating lucrative international
telephone traffic. In a recent research report, Morgan Stanley described KPN
as being in the forefront of telecommunications and postal liberalisation in
Europe, while BZW rated it as potentially 'the most attractive of the
European quoted telephone companies'.
In 1992, KPN posted net profit of Fl 1.67bn on turnover of Fl 15.6bn, a rise
of 3.4 per cent on the year before.
Predictions for the value of KPN hinge not so much on investors' perceptions
of the postal activities as on the company's expected dividend policy. KPN
pays out 40 per cent of net profits to the Dutch state, and initial
indications are that this level will not be raised significantly in the
first few years after privatisation.
Partly balancing this, Dutch regulators are expected to adopt a relatively
benign attitude to post-privatisation pricing of postal and
telecommunication services, meaning that KPN will not face overly strict
constraints on either of its businesses.
So far, analysts have assigned a broad Fl 16bn-Fl 22bn range for the total
value of KPN, meaning that a first 30 per cent tranche could be worth more
than Fl 5bn. Much will depend on the climate of the Amsterdam bourse next
year; the details of the flotation legislation that is being examined by
parliament; and, to a lesser extent, whether the government will want to
build in incentives to entice private shareholders.
Last month, the Dutch state chose NM Rothschild &amp; Sons, the British
investment bank to advise on all aspects of the sale, including the
flotation price.
KPN has chosen another Anglo-Saxon investment house, Goldman Sachs, to act
on its behalf. Dutch banks, passed over in the Netherlands' most significant
privatisation since the flotation of DSM, the chemicals group, in the late
1980s, are expected to win prominent roles in the underwriting syndicate.
Unlike the British government, the Dutch government has never given any
priority to increasing the country's base of small shareholders through
privatisation. Incentives are therefore more doubtful, although not ruled
out.
Rather than pursuing ideological goals, the state's sell-off is designed to
bolster KPN's position in the fast-changing world of telecommunications and
postal services.
KPN is smaller than BT, AT&amp;T and other privatisation candidates such as
Deutsche Telekom of Germany, but it is determinedly trying to compete with
its bigger rivals in providing telecommunication services to multinational
companies.
Its vehicle for this competitive and expensive area of international
telecommunications is Unisource, a venture with Sweden's Televerket and
Swiss Telecom. This pits the Dutch company against BT's Syncordia and the
French-German joint venture Eunetcom as well as against AT&amp;T's Worldsource
partnership.
By buying shares in KPN, investors will not be gaining access to one of the
dominant companies of the industry. However, KPN's attraction lies in its
plucky and nimble efforts to hold its own and expand its influence in a
global sector where national barriers are swiftly being dismantled.

<TEXT>
KLM Royal Dutch Airlines said yesterday all its flights to the US from
Amsterdam would operate as code-sharing services with Northwest Airlines,
the US carrier in which it owns a minority stake.
The joint flights are due to begin in late September and will cover all 11
KLM destinations in the US.
The decision means that the airlines will fly their existing routes between
the US and Amsterdam under a new dual flight number based on the old
Northwest and the old KLM code. 'By operating through joint ventures, the
airlines can present their combined product through a central reservation
system, optimising service to customers,' the airlines said.
The use of a single flight number combining both airlines' codes is designed
to encourage Northwest passengers to transfer to KLM flights, and vice
versa.
Since the start of the summer season, the airlines have experimented with
code sharing on flights to Minneapolis/St Paul, Detroit and Boston. The
eight other cities that will be added are New York, Chicago, Washington,
Atlanta, Orlando, Houston, Los Angeles and San Francisco.

FT  21 JUL 93 / International Company News: Marginal rise for Siemens at
nine months
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NET profits at Siemens, Germany's biggest electrical and electronics group,
rose by 1 per cent to DM1.32bn (Dollars 776m) in the first nine months of
the financial year to the end of June.
Siemens said business had been 'robust' in the nine months against the
background of a weak world economy. Group turnover climbed by 2 per cent to
DM55.8bn while order intake fell back by 5 per cent to DM59.9bn.
Business outside Germany compensated for a downturn in the domestic market.
Turnover in Germany dropped 3 per cent but abroad rose 6 per cent to
DM30.7bn.
Although the pattern was repeated with new orders, where there was a 12 per
cent drop in Germany offset by a 2 per cent increase abroad, Siemens said
this was not to be taken as a sign of a worldwide recovery.
The company said the growth in orders outside Germany was due to a number of
large projects in plant-building and systems, rather than economic recovery.
The strong expansion in infrastructure business - which had lasted for the
past three years - had reached a plateau, albeit at a high level, Siemens
said. Business with industrial customers had weakened further, whereas there
had been an increase in transportation and energy production systems.
Together with construction-related products, these had been the areas of
most substantial growth in turnover.
In common with other large German companies, Siemens has moved to cut staff
numbers in a bid to reduce costs. At the end of June, the group employed
401,000 people worldwide, down from 413,000 at the beginning of the
financial year. Despite this 3 per cent staff reduction, personnel costs
rose by 6 per cent to DM26.3bn. Investments totalled DM4.7bn, down from
DM6bn in the comparable period last year.

BIL GT, the financial group built around Bank in Liechtenstein, has reported
a 53 per cent jump in consolidated net income in the first half of 1993 to
SFr69m (Dollars 46m).
Like other banking groups based in the Swiss market, the group has benefited
from an unusual combination of rising and active securities markets,
declining interest rates, large inflows of funds and relatively stable
expenses.
BIL GT said all its companies contributed to the overall increase in assets
under administration to SFr44.8bn at June 30, up 16 per cent from a year
earlier. Assets under management rose 21 per cent to SFr24.6bn.
A 25 per cent advance in group revenues to SFr255m resulted from a
substantial increase in net interest income and brokerage earnings together
with increased investment management fees and higher dealing profits.
Administrative expenses were up only 10 per cent, and most of it was
attributed to the higher business activity level.
The directors said they were confident of achieving 'a good business year'.

FT  21 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Carlsberg-Tetley deal with Eldridge Pope
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CARLSBERG-TETLEY and Eldridge Pope are forming a trading alliance designed
to widen distribution and boost market share of their beer brands.
Under the agreement, Carlsberg-Tetley - created earlier this year from the
merger of the UK brewing operations of Carlsberg and Allied-Lyons - will
become the principal supplier of lager, led by the Carlsberg and Castlemaine
brands, to Eldridge Pope's 180 pubs.
It will also acquire the Dorset-based brewer's beer wholesaling business for
Pounds 5.8m, giving it access to other free trade pubs and further
strengthening its position in the Wessex area. The operation last year made
a profit of Pounds 425,000 on turnover of Pounds 8.2m.
Regional distribution of the combined portfolio will be handled by Eldridge
Pope from Dorchester. Carlsberg-Tetley's depot in Bournemouth will close at
the end of the year.
Carlsberg-Tetley will sell Eldridge Pope's Thomas Hardy and Royal Oak cask
ales as part of its national portfolio elsewhere in the country and will
sign a three-year production contract with the Dorchester brewery.
The Dorset brewer is to strengthen its own sales team to expand sales to
wholesalers, including other brewers, retail pub groups and the take-home
market.
Eldridge Pope's wholesale wine operations will continue to supply customers
throughout the country but Carlsberg-Tetley will distribute wines in in the
Wessex region.
The deal should help to consolidate Eldridge Pope's recovery from costly
hotel and computer ventures. Mr Christopher Pope, chairman, said yesterday
that the company's objectives were to become a leading pub retailer, develop
its brands nationally and expand its wine wholesaling.
'This alliance gives us the opportunity to move forward on all three fronts
at once', he stated.
Funds from the sale of the beer wholesaling operation would be used for
improvements to the company's pubs and possible expansion of the estate.
Mr Don Marshall, Carlsberg-Tetley's managing director, said the alliance
would strengthen sales and distribution of the company's brands in more than
550 outlets in the Wessex region and offer cost savings from the merged
operations.
Shares in Allied-Lyons closed 3p up at 548p while Eldridge Pope shares,
quoted on the USM, gained 5p to 104p.

FT  21 JUL 93 / UK Company News: EFM seeks Pounds 50m for smaller companies
investment trust
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EDINBURGH Fund Managers, the international fund management group, yesterday
announced the launch of EFM Small Companies Trust to take advantage of what
it believes is a favourable economic climate for investment in the sector.
The trust aims to raise Pounds 50m through a placing and public offer.
James Capel, broker to the launch, has already placed Pounds 37.5m from
directors and institutions and is seeking another Pounds 12.5m through the
public offer.
The trust has a simple capital structure of 50m ordinary shares with one
warrant attached to every five shares, at 100p each.
Each warrant will give the shareholder the right to subscribe to one
ordinary share at 100p in any year from 1994 to 2008.
The public offer begins today and closes on August 11. Dealings in the
shares are expected to start on August 19.
Investment will be in companies with a market capitalisation of Pounds 100m
or less, and returns will be measured against the Hoare Govett Smaller
Companies Index.
Mr Iain Watt, managing director of EFM, said: 'We now believe that the
economic climate for investment in small companies will produce some
excellent opportunities of which this new company can take advantage.'
He believes that small companies were undervalued while sentiment towards
them was improving.
EFM already has a small companies unit trust, with Pounds 78.3m under
management at the beginning of July.
This has regularly been top or within the top five performing funds in the
sector in the 10 years to July 1, according to Finstat.

FT  21 JUL 93 / UK Company News: St Andrew Trust lifts net assets 15%
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ST ANDREW Trust, the smaller companies trust now controlled by the
Ecclesiastical Insurance Office, reported a net asset value of 287.2p per
share as at June 30.
Mr David Ross Stewart, chairman, said: 'The rise in net asset value per
share of over 15 per cent (against the year-end value of 249.5p) is a
welcome vindication of our faith in smaller companies.'
Year-on-year net asset value showed an increase of 26 per cent.
Attributable revenue at this Martin Currie-managed trust dipped to Pounds
1.21m (Pounds 1.22m) for the six month period. The chairman added: 'Our
revenue from dividends is holding up well despite a general slowdown in
dividend growth and significantly lower interest rates on our cash
deposits'.
The trust's Japanese portfolio expanded by more than 50 per cent over the
period and 'good moves from other Far East markets fully justified our
international stance', he added.
Overseas investment currently accounts for almost 32 per cent of the
portfolio.
The interim dividend is maintained at 2.7p, payable from earnings of 3.51p
(3.56p) per share.

FT  21 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Marling cuts deficit to Pounds 9.6m -
Disposal of Spanish arm and acquisition in Germany completes refocusing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN A busy period of rest-ructuring and rationalisation, Marling Industries
reduced pre-tax losses from Pounds 27.9m to Pounds 9.6m in the year to March
31.
The new management team, led by chief executive Mr David Abel Smith since
January 1992, has been refocusing the group on its core activities of safety
belt webbing and industrial textiles.
It has engineered the real reduction of employee numbers across the group by
25 per cent to 678 jobs; it has completed the planned disposal programme
with yesterday's announcement of the sale of Murtra Group, its principal
Spanish businesses, for a nominal Pta1; and has simultaneously moved the
group into a new, though related, product area with the DM7.4m (Pounds 2.9m)
acquisition of Muller Group.
Muller, which is based in central Germany, makes elasticated products for
the 'growing' incontinence products market as well as sports bandages and
knitted elastic bands.
The cash acquisition is being funded by a 1-for-10 rights issue of up to
16.1m new ordinary shares at 19p apiece. This is the second cash call in a
year - the first was for Pounds 18m to fund restructuring. As part of the
purchase Marling is to refinance DM10m of Muller's debt at 7.25 per cent
(currently 10.75 per cent).
Earlier in the year Boalloy, the commercial vehicle body maker, was sold to
certain of its managers, and the automotive safety airbags joint venture has
been sold to Electrolux Autoliv, Marling's partner.
Yesterday the group finished clearing the decks with the disposal of Murtra.
Mr Abel Smith cited other UK companies withdrawing from Spain - Amstrad and
British Vita - and explained that the Spanish economy had collapsed since
the Barcelona Olympics.
Marling had already largely reorganised Murtra, but it would have still
needed 'significant cash injections'. It was the poorest performing part of
the group, incurring operating losses of Pounds 1.7m and a deficit of Pounds
2.6m before tax. Marling stands to gain deferred consideration of up to
Pounds 1.5m depending on its future profitability.
Mr William Rollason, finance director, pointed out that Marling's earnings
per share from the continuing businesses - excluding Murtra and
'non-operational items' (Pounds 581,000 on the sale of a German property,
Pounds 6.32m provisions for the Spanish operations, and Pounds 1.4m for
Boalloy) - were 1.54p, against losses of 11.3p last time.
Under the same calculations, turnover grew to Pounds 54.7m (Pounds 52.3m),
operating profits were Pounds 4m (losses Pounds 1.6m) and pre-tax profits
amounted to Pounds 2.1m after interest payable of Pounds 1.9m (Pounds 2.2m).
He added that as the cost reductions from productivity and efficiencies
started to take effect, the operating profit margin improved to 7.4 per
cent.
However, the official figures, compiled on an FRS 3 basis, show that
turnover declined from Pounds 102.7m to Pounds 79m, with continuing
operations contributing Pounds 73.4m (Pounds 74.8m). Total operating profits
amounted to Pounds 2.09m (losses Pounds 6.4m): here continuing operations
pitched in Pounds 2.37m (losses Pounds 2.46m).
Interest payable took Pounds 2.98m (Pounds 3.47m). Borrowings before the
Murtra sale were Pounds 15.8m and, after losing its Pounds 3.1m debt,
gearing will stand at 69 per cent. Losses per share were 7.8p (69.55p).
On the basis of continuing operations, a final and only dividend of 0.65p is
proposed (0.3p).

FT  21 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Bromsgrove expands in US and wins new
orders
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BROMSGROVE Industries yesterday announced an acquisition in the US for
Dollars 3.5m (Pounds 2.33m) in cash and loan notes, and new orders which
reflected its investment in specialist niche markets.
The acquisition is of the Montgomery Group, a Houston-based precision
machinist servicing the international oil and gas extraction industry.
Montgomery employs 25 people and in its last financial year recorded
turnover of Dollars 3m.
A subsidiary, Thornton Precision Forgings, is to supply compressor-vanes for
the Pratt &amp; Whitney F100 engine.
Initially the contract is worth Dollars 200,000 and is Thornton's first
significant US military order.
Rover Group has transferred the casting of 16 engine components to BSK
Aluminium, the Droitwich-based company.
Initially worth Pounds 450,000 annually, the contract could be worth Pounds
750,000 if machining was brought in-house.
BSK has also won orders, potentially worth up to Pounds 2.8m per year from
1994, for component supply to vehicles not yet officially announced.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
PRE-TAX losses at Prospect Industries increased, as expected, from Pounds
737,000 to Pounds 1.24m in the six months to March 31.
Traditional seasonality was exacerbated by recent acquisitions, said Mr
Philip Wilbraham, chairman.
Full-year figures would encompass the benefit of the Davenport purchase and
the main trading period of Dunn International, and the interim dividend is
lifted to 0.275p (0.25p) to reflect expectations for the second half.
The group provides specialist engineering services to the power generating
and process industries. For the previous 12 months to September 30 it made
pre-tax profits of Pounds 4.44m.
Turnover in the half year jumped from Pounds 14.7m to Pounds 22.1m, and
orders books were in excess of Pounds 75m, against Pounds 25m last year. The
winning of the turnkey repair and maintenance contract at Ferrybridge Power
Station by Dunn was probably the most significant contract gained.
Losses per share came to 0.56p (0.47p).

increased sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ELONEX, the privately-owned personal computer manufacturer, reported lower
full-year profits despite a 35 per cent increase in turnover.
Pre-tax profits in the year to April 30 slipped from Pounds 9.08m to Pounds
6.83m on turnover which increased from Pounds 57.8m to Pounds 78m.
Mr Michael Spiro, finance director said: 'Last year was generally a
difficult period for the UK computer industry with deepening recession, a
price war intensified by cheaper product ranges from the multinationals, and
a 25 per cent fall in the value of sterling.'
While many of Elonex's rivals in the fiercely competitive PC market have
reported heavy losses, and in some cases have disappeared, he said Elonex
had 'managed to hold its own in the marketplace.'
Despite the downturn in profits the company, which had net current assets of
Pounds 13.2m (Pounds 10.5m) and capital and reserves of Pounds 17.5m (Pounds
12.4m) at the end of April, still plans a flotation 'in due course.'

FT  21 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Anglian Water links to exploit US
privatisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ANGLIAN WATER is to form a joint venture with American Water Works, the
largest water utility in North America outside government hands, to exploit
privatisation of municipal waste water services in the US.
The move follows establishment of a similar venture between Yorkshire Water
and an Indianapolis-based water company.
Both joint ventures have begun the process of tendering to operate two large
waste water, or sewage plants, for the municipality of Indianapolis.
Together with Lyonnais des Eaux-Dumez and Generale des Eaux, the two French
groups which are also tendering, the European water companies are exploiting
an opportunity that has arisen since the US Environment Protection Agency
decided to experiment with limited privatisation.
The European water industry believes it is significantly more efficient at
running sewage plants than the US municipalities have proved to be. One UK
industry estimate suggests the Indianapolis plants could be operated with
half their current staff levels.
If the limited experiment with privatisation is rolled out to other US
cities, European water companies could be well positioned to carve out a
significant market share, UK industry executives said.
Initially, the US municipalities will be seeking tenders to operate their
plant. Full privatisation will have to wait longer. Federal law currently
prevents the sale of assets, like many of the municipal water treatment
plants, that were built with substantial Federal grant assistance.
Mr Chris Mellor, finance director of Anglian, the UK's largest privatised
water company, said his joint venture would seek operating and maintenance
contracts and opportunities to control waste water systems in the US.
Anglian and American are each paying Dollars 100,000 (Pounds 67,000) into
the venture to fund working capital needs of what will initially be a
marketing company.
Following criticism of diversifications made by other privatised water
companies, Mr Mellor stressed that Anglian was not diversifying but
expanding into a related area.
He said American Water had only limited experience in waste water and
Anglian had no experience of operating in the US. The two were therefore a
natural fit.
US privatisation presented substantial export opportunities, Mr Mellor said.
American Water Works owns 125 water utility systems in 20 states, has assets
worth Pounds 1.5bn and annual revenues of Pounds 430m.

FT  21 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Brasway falls to Pounds 0.8m despite cost
cutting
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER A period of cost cutting and structural change, pre-tax profits of
Brasway showed a sharp decline, from Pounds 1.25m to Pounds 776,000, over
the year to May 1.
The result was bolstered by an exceptional profit of Pounds 751,000 on the
sale in April of Brasway Tube, which incurred a loss of Pounds 167,000 over
the period.
Group turnover fell Pounds 3.5m to Pounds 30.4m.
The company said that of this decline Pounds 2.5m was accounted for by
Brasway Tube.
Mr Mark Swaby, chairman, said that despite the disappointing figures a final
dividend of 0.27p is proposed. This will make a total of 0.51p (0.58p) for
the year, payable from earnings per share of 0.69p (1.15p).
Following the disposal of the Brasway Tube business the group acquired
Winster Hose for a sum not exceeding Pounds 2.41m.
Winster, which makes hoses, couplings and assemblies for the mining,
agriculture and construction industries, will be integrated with the group's
Europower business.
Mr Swaby said that after the restructuring the balance sheet remained
healthy, with gearing of 33 per cent at the end of April.

FT  21 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Not yet first choice for fashion - The
image problems facing House of Fraser
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHOPPERS VISITING stores such as Rackhams, Army &amp; Navy and Dickins and Jones
may never realise they are shopping in a House of Fraser shop - unless they
happen to notice the group logo on the carrier bag.
After House of Fraser's eight years as a private company owned by the Fayed
brothers, the investment community may be similarly unaware of the full
extent of its retail empire. Overcoming the City's scepticism and ignorance
is one of the biggest tasks the group faces before its flotation next year.
Although the department stores have effectively been run as a separate
business, in spite of the presence of Mr Ali Fayed as chairman, they have
often been swallowed up in the publicity surrounding the Fayeds and the
flagship Harrods store.
No 1980s takeover battle was more ruthlessly fought than that for House of
Fraser, pitting the Fayed bothers, Mohamed and Ali, against Mr Tiny Rowland
and his Lonrho trading conglomerate.
'One cannot deny that there is in some quarters a credibility problem,'
admits Mr Brian McGowan, the man brought in to replace Mr Fayed as
non-executive chairman and to prepare the chain for flotation. Mr McGowan,
48, was sufficiently convinced of House of Fraser's strengths to postpone
his retirement.
One strength, he believes, is its assets base. House of Fraser has 59 stores
with total floorspace of almost 5m sq ft. About 90 per cent of the property
is freehold - with a value of about Pounds 250m.
The chain stretches from Inverness to Plymouth, trading under names such as
Rackhams, Dingles, Army &amp; Navy, Dickins and Jones, Binns and Frasers.
Mr McGowan believes another strength of the business is that many of the
stores are popular and well established retailers with customer loyalty
built up over 100 years or more.
Moreover, he says, rumours that the company has been starved of cash since
it was bought by the Fayeds in 1985 are untrue. Capital investment has been
about Pounds 100m over the last five years, and the shape of the chain has
changed significantly.
In 1985, it had 93 stores. Many smaller, underperforming stores have been
closed, while new stores have opened in the Lakeside retail park at
Thurrock, at Meadowhall near Sheffield, Leicester and Milton Keynes.
The store closure programme means turnover has been relatively static. For
the year to January, sales were Pounds 695m, little different from the
figures for 1990 or 1988.
But operating profits increased from Pounds 21.6m to Pounds 36.8m. The
company said yesterday that sales up to the end of June were running 7 per
cent ahead of last year.
Mr Andrew Jennings, House of Fraser's managing director since 1992, says the
rationalisation programme is largely complete.
While isolated closures may still occur, the company is now left with a core
store base, which it can gradually expand, largely through out of town
developments.
The way forward, he says, is to continue the programme begun last year of
cutting costs and repositioning the business as the first-choice destination
for fashion clothing and accessories as well as 'fashionable' furniture and
housewares.
The number of full-time equivalent staff fell from 10,500 people to 8,300 by
January 1993, and the ratio of full-time to part-time staff changed from
about 60:40 to about 40:60, resulting in a Pounds 6m saving on wage costs.
Layers of management have been removed, and new systems are allowing further
productivity improvements.
Mr Jennings is continuing to look at the product mix, reducing and focusing
the range and the number of suppliers.
The company has some way to go in making the most of its retailing space.
According to a recent report by Verdict, the retail market research company,
sales per square foot at House of Fraser stores last year were only Pounds
143, compared with Pounds 195 for the Debenhams chain, and Pounds 408 for
the John Lewis Partnership's department stores.
However, its operating margin, at 5.3 per cent, was well above Debenhams'
4.0 per cent, although it lagged behind John Lewis's 5.8 per cent.
Mr Nick Bubb, retail analyst at Morgan Stanley, said the City would remain
suspicious of House of Fraser until it had chance to examine the company's
figures for the last seven years, and would take a lot of convincing that
the chain could look forward to profits growth.

FT  21 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Ocean Group to expand in Spain
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Ocean Group, the industrial and distribution services company, is to build
an Pounds 18m automated distribution centre near Barcelona.
Ocean said the 22,000 sq m facility would significantly strengthen its
position as a distributor on the Continent through McGregor Cory, its
specialist subsidiary.
The announcement coincides with the award of of a six-year, multi-million
pound contract by Procter &amp; Gamble for Serralta, McGregor Cory's Spanish
subsidiary, to distribute detergents and household cleaning products in
Spain.
Ocean said it believed that the Barcelona development would be the first
multi-client facility of its kind in Spain. As well and Procter &amp; Gamble, it
would distribute for a number of McGregor Cory's Spanish-based customers,
including Mars Effem, Pryca and Schweppes.
The facility is expected to begin operations in autumn next year and
generate turnover of more than Pounds 10m in its first 12 months.

FT  21 JUL 93 / UK Company News: SB's future clouded by expiry of US patent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SMITHKLINE Beecham's ability to overcome the inevitable damage which will be
inflicted next May by the expiry of the US patents of Tagamet, its
best-selling product, will be crucial to the group's future.
Tagamet, an anti-ulcer treatment that was once the world's best-selling
drug, still generated sales of Dollars 1.1bn (Pounds 730m) last year. Of
these about Dollars 650m were in the US. The division's turnover last year
was Pounds 2.8bn.
'This is bad news. Anyone who thinks the patent expiry won't have a
substantial impact on SB is going to be disappointed. The drug still has
substantial sales and is very profitable,' says Mr Jan Leschley, head of
SB's pharmaceuticals arm, and the group's chief executive designate.
SB's strategy is to launch an over-the-counter version of Tagamet and to
generate growth through new products.
A slight hiccup in the first element of the strategy is that before the
merger of SmithKline of the US with the UK group, Beecham, the American
company sold the OTC distribution rights for Tagamet in the UK to Wellcome.
Mr Leschley refuses to discuss the issue, which he describes as delicate.
Meanwhile the company has lodged its dossier to the US Food and Drug
Administration for the medicine to make the switch to OTC status.
As for generating growth through new products, Mr Leschley stressed the
success of Paxil, its new anti-depressant, Relafen, an arthritis drug,
Kytril, an anti-nausea product, and Havrix, a hepatitis A vaccine. These
generated Pounds 96m in new sales during the second quarter, compared with
Pounds 212m for the whole of last year.
The US launch of Paxil has outpaced that of the market leader among the
advanced selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors, Eli Lilly's Prozac. SB's
drug has captured 15.6 per cent of new prescriptions during the second
quarter, compared with 6 per cent in February when it was launched. The
medicine has 24 per cent of the whole UK anti-depressant market and 20 per
cent of the Dutch market.
Relafen's performance in the US was described by Mr Leschley as
'tremendous'. Kytril was doing well, and the roll-out of Havrix was
extremely successful, he said.
However, SB's strategy for continued growth may be held up by the worsening
environment for drugs companies. European drugs sales during the second
quarter were up only 1 per cent. Turnover in Germany and Italy, where
healthcare reforms have been introduced, fell 9 per cent and 15 per cent
respectively. In France and the UK sales were up 10 per cent and 8 per cent.
Mr Leschley said: 'I'm not optimistic about Germany and Italy for the full
year. And there's no doubt that in France, the UK and Spain we will see
cost-containment measures introduced in the near future.'
SB's response will not be like that of Merck, the world's largest drugs
group, which yesterday announced further redundancies, said Mr Leschley.
'We have no plans whatsoever to make across-the-board lay-offs. That is not
to say there will not be redundancies in selective pockets. We've just laid
off 100 sales representatives in Germany,' he said.

FT  21 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Marine Midland shows 82% advance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MARINE Midland Bank, the US subsidiary of Hongkong and Shanghai Bank,
yesterday reported an 82 per cent increase, from Dollars 43.6m to Dollars
79.3m (Pounds 52.8m), in net profits for the first half of 1993.
The New York-based regional bank, which has Dollars 17bn in assets, said
that second quarter net profits grew by a more modest 10 per cent to Dollars
45.3m (Dollars 41m).
Net interest income in the second quarter was Dollars 186.6m (Dollars
178.9m) with the increase partly due to the improved quality of Marine's
loan portfolio.
However, the bank incurred a Dollars 56.1m loss in non-interest income
reflecting an extraordinary Dollars 127.7m net write-down of mortgage
servicing rights to reflect high refinancing levels.
This loss was more than offset by the release of Dollars 115m in provisions
for loan losses. The release of the provisions, and the resulting drop in
the allowance for loan losses to Dollars 391.2m, reflected the continuing
decline in non accruing loans and net commercial charge offs.
The allowance represented 79.2 per cent of non-accruing loans at the end of
the first half, compared to 65.6 per cent a year earlier.
The bank ended the first half with an increased Tier 1 risk-weighted capital
ratio of 9.61 per cent, compared to 8.67 per cent a year earlier.

FT  21 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Poor second half leaves Reliance Security
down 68%
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
RELIANCE Security Group suffered badly in the second half and over the year
to April 30 experienced a 68 per cent plunge in pre-tax profits.
The shares dropped 13p to 117p.
The dividend, however, is maintained at 4.5p, the final being 3.4p to which
directors waived half their entitlement. Earnings per share came to 3.5p
(10.2p).
Turnover rose to Pounds 68m (Pounds 63.4m) and pre-tax profit worked through
at Pounds 1.11m (Pounds 3.42m), struck after further losses of Pounds 1.2m
(Pounds 900,000) in developing the electronic surveillance business towards
the critical mass in sales needed to generate profits.
Also, for this year, there was an exceptional debit of Pounds 352,000
relating to reorganisation of central support services and operations
administration.
Mr Brian Kingham, chairman, said that despite recession the group had
continued with a number of investment programmes which had been costly but
would more than compensate in the strength gained from market position.
For the current year he forecast a recovery in earnings, even without a
significant change in market conditions.

FT  21 JUL 93 / SmithKline up 18% in quarter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SMITHKLINE Beecham, the Anglo-US healthcare group, reported an 18 per cent
rise in pre-tax profits for the three months to June 30 to Pounds 294m, from
Pounds 249m the previous year.
Turnover in the second quarter increased 19 per cent from Pounds 1.26bn to
Pounds 1.51bn and the results were flattered by currency gains. Excluding
exchange, sales of continuing operations rose 8 per cent and trading profits
10 per cent.
The company made an exceptional profit of Pounds 37m on the sale of its hair
care products to Wella. The profit from the Dollars 320m (Pounds 212m)
disposal of its personal care brands to Sara Lee and a provision for the
restructuring of the remaining consumer brands will be made in the third
quarter.
The pharmaceuticals division reported a 13 per cent rise in trading profits
Pounds 157m to Pounds 177m on sales up 22 per cent to Pounds 834m. However,
at constant exchange rates sales and trading profits were only 7 per cent
and 11 per cent higher.
SB said the second quarter last year had been particularly strong. Sales of
SB's new products, Paxil, Kytril, Relafen and and Havrix, fell between the
first and second quarter this year from Pounds 107m to Pounds 96m. The
company blamed destocking in the US after the launch of Paxil earlier this
year.
Drugs sales in Europe rose only 1 per cent. Growth in the UK and France only
partly offset steep declines of 9 per cent and 18 per cent in Germany and
Italy, following healthcare reforms.
Mr Bob Bauman, chief executive, warned that the healthcare market was
becoming more difficult to forecast and the long-term impact of the
challenging economic and regulatory environment was not clear.
Animal health trading profits increased 22 per cent from Pounds 9m to Pounds
11m on sales up 21 per cent to Pounds 91m.
At constant exchange rates sales and trading profits were rose 6 per cent
and 20 per cent.
Consumer brands operating profits rose 4 per cent from Pounds 34m to Pounds
36m, on turnover up 20 per cent to Pounds 320m.
Excluding currency exchange, sales rose 9 per cent and profits were flat.
Trading profits at clinical laboratories reported trading profits up 19 per
cent from Pounds 19m to at Pounds 22m, on sales up 38 per cent from Pounds
144m to Pounds 201m.
Excluding currency exchange, sales were up rose 16 per cent and trading up
rose 18 per cent. The figures were flattered by acquisitions.
A second quarter dividend was declared of 2.533p per A share, 4.756 cents
per equity unit and 23.78 cents per equity unit ADR.

FT  21 JUL 93 / Loan quality boosts Citicorp
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A SHARP drop in write-offs on property and commercial loans and a fall in
loan-loss provisions fuelled a profits recovery at Citicorp, the US's
largest banking group, in the second three months of the year.
The group's results echoed the improvement in credit quality reported by
other US banks in recent days, due to firmer property prices and the first
clear signs that the patchy US economic recovery is feeding through to
banks' customers.
Record income from trading in the foreign exchange and securities markets
also lifted Citicorp's after-tax profits, which reached Dollars 446m (Pounds
296m), up from Dollars 143m in the same period in 1992.
Write-offs on property and commercial loans at the banking group fell to
Dollars 297m, down from Dollars 380m in the first quarter and well below the
peak of Dollars 792m in the last quarter of 1991.
Lower losses on north American commercial property were behind the
improvement: credit losses dropped from Dollars 527m in the second quarter
of 1992 to Dollars 251m. Provisions for commercial and property loan losses
made during the quarter were Dollars 273m, down from Dollars 583m a year
before.
Income from trading in financial markets soared to Dollars 572m, from
Dollars 314m a year earlier, topping the quarterly record for a US bank set
by JP Morgan only a week ago with Dollars 431m. Some Dollars 352m (up from
Dollars 193m) came from foreign exchange.
Leaving aside the lower credit charges and gains from trading, profits
remained sluggish, contributing to a Dollars  1/4 decline in the group's
share price to Dollars 31 3/4 by close. Mr John Reed, chairman, said revenue
growth had been held back by 'troubled economies in the developed world',
but that developing countries had grown strongly.
Earnings per share in the second quarter reached 82 cents, up from 25 cents.
For the first half net income was Dollars 1.1bn, or Dollars 2.06 a share,
compared with Dollars 326m, or Dollars 0.61 a share, in the first six months
of 1992, after an accounting change. The group's key tier one capital ratio
rose to 5.7 per cent from 5.3 per cent at the end of March.

FT  21 JUL 93 / Philip Morris extends price cut to premium cigarettes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PHILIP Morris, which shocked the US tobacco industry in April by temporarily
slashing the price of its Marlboro cigarettes, yesterday made the 20 per
cent price cut permanent and extended it to other premium brands, including
Virginia Slims and Benson &amp; Hedges.
The move confirms that the price of Marlboro, the best-selling cigarette in
the US, was out of line with cheap discount products before the cut on April
2, known as 'Marlboro Friday'.
Philip Morris said that the price cut had reversed Marlboro's slide in
market share. Its US tobacco profits have, however, been hit hard by the
cuts.
The company, which also makes food and drink products, yesterday announced
second quarter earnings of Dollars 1.1bn (Pounds 730m), down 22.2 per cent.
The results and its price action had been expected on Wall Street and its
shares closed up Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 48 1/2 .
The discount sector, which consists of cheap branded goods and unbranded
generic cigarettes, has grown rapidly in recent years at the expense of
premium brands and now accounts for 40 per cent of the US market. Philip
Morris, one of the largest companies in the discount market, also announced
pricing changes in this area.
It said it would push up the price of its most heavily discounted brands and
move less heavily discounted brands down to that level, creating a two-tier
price structure rather than the present three tiers. None of the cuts
affects markets outside the US.
Other manufacturers seem bound to follow the premium price cuts but may not
raise the price of deeply discounted brands. RJ Reynolds, the other leading
US tobacco company, said it would match Philip Morris' action at both ends
of the market.
Philip Morris said Marlboro's market share, which bottomed out at less than
22 per cent in March after eight months of decline, had risen to 22.6 per
cent in May, according to Nielsen, the market research company. Its own data
suggested the July share might rise to 24 per cent. Growth had been coming
at the expense of both premium brands and discount cigarettes.
Philip Morris added that the price changes would not affect the forecast
made in April of operating earnings from its US tobacco business falling by
as much as 40 per cent this year.

FT  21 JUL 93 / Jobs cuts force charge on Merck
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MERCK, the world's biggest drugs group, yesterday said it was taking a
pre-tax Dollars 775m (Pounds 516m) second-quarter charge to cover voluntary
redundancies and other cost-cutting measures.
The group added that it would cut about 2,100 jobs by the end of this year,
about 1,100 more than previously announced.
Stripping out the charges, Merck posted a 9 per cent rise in underlying
second-quarter profits to Dollars 693.6m, or 61 cents a share, against
Dollars 643m, or 56 cents, last year. Including restructuring charges, Merck
recorded net income of Dollars 172.6m, or 15 cents, in the 1993 quarter.
Sales rose 8 per cent to Dollars 2.57bn from Dollars 2.37bn.
The figures were in line with expectations and Wall Street was enthusiastic
about the restructuring plans. Merck's shares rose Dollars 1 to close at
Dollars 33 1/8 .
Merck's job cuts will cost Dollars 450m. In the longer term, Merck plans to
consolidate and streamline manufacturing facilities and distribution centres
at a cost of Dollars 325m.
As a result, Merck will make futher job cuts, largely outside the US,
starting next year.
Mr Roy Vagelos, chairman and chief executive, said the reduced employment
costs should save more than Dollars 140m annually.
For the first half, Merck posted net income of Dollars 786.3m, or 69 cents,
against Dollars 740.3m, or 64 cents, a year ago.
Excluding the restructuring charges in 1993 and charges for accounting
changes in 1992, earnings rose 9 per cent to Dollars 1.31bn from Dollars
1.2bn.

FT  21 JUL 93 / House of Fraser on the block: Flotation designed to enable
Fayed brothers to repay debts but keep Harrods
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY and ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FAYED brothers yesterday announced plans for the flotation of the House
of Fraser department store chain next year - excluding the Harrods flagship.
The brothers believe the flotation of the 59-store chain will enable them to
pay off their debts while allowing them to keep Harrods, always seen as the
main object of their takeover of House of Fraser. They acquired the group
for around Pounds 600m in 1985 after a battle with Lonrho, the conglomerate.
House of Fraser said the Fayeds had been advised by SG Warburg, their
advisers, that a flotation was in the best interests of the chain and of the
brothers. The group had not ruled out the possibility of a trade sale, but
'we are not anticipating that'.
Warburg is thought to have valued the stores at more than Pounds 500m,
although analysts expressed scepticism at this.
Mr Ali Fayed stepped down as chairman of the stores chain yesterday and will
be replaced by Mr Brian McGowan, former chief executive of Williams
Holdings. The flotation is expected by early summer next year. The Fayeds
will retain no stake in the stores and their holding company name will be
changed.
As well as Harrods, the brothers will retain control of Turnbull and Asser,
the upmarket shirtmaker, the Kurt Geiger shoe chain, the Barkers shops and
office complex in Kensington, the Carlton Highland Hotel in Edinburgh, and
the Harrods depository in London.
A management buy-out of the stores in April is believed to have failed
because the management was unable to raise the Pounds 320m asking price.
In the same month, the Fayeds sold their 10.6 per cent stake in the Sears
retailing group, rousing speculation that the group was in financial
difficulties with debts of about Pounds 650m.
House of Fraser group denied yesterday the Fayeds were under financial
pressure, and said they had arranged a refinancing in April.
Before taking on the job, Mr McGowan insisted that he should be able to
resign without having to give any notice to the Fayeds. 'That preserves my
independence.'
Mr Derek Higgs, managing director of SG Warburg, asked Mr McGowan to take up
the non-executive chairmanship a month after the bank had satisfied itself
that the stores were a good candidate for flotation.

FT  21 JUL 93 / McGowan rises to the bait of the big float
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For a man who was looking forward to spending his time fishing, it appears
to be an odd appointment. Mr Brian McGowan's chairmanship of the House of
Fraser Stores may be non-executive, but as he conceded yesterday, his rod
may have to stay at home for longer than he originally planned.
The idea of working on a flotation, which he regards as 'meat and drink',
was too enticing to turn down after the disappointment of not pulling off
any big deal at Williams Holdings for several years. Mr McGowan does not
officially step down as chief executive from the industrial conglomerate
until the end of the year, although he has passed on most of his duties to
his successor Mr Roger Carr.
Mr McGowan says he is aware, however, that accepting the chair of the House
of Fraser Stores was not without its risks. While the HoF is to be kept a
separate autonomous business there is always the possibility that Mr
McGowan's image could be tainted by working for the Fayed brothers.
The takeover of the House of Fraser by the Egyptian brothers was one of the
most controversial in UK corporate history. They were able to mount their
bid when Lonrho, the international conglomerate, sold its 29.9 per cent
stake in the HoF to the Fayeds for Pounds 138.3m in 1984.
Mr Tiny Rowland, Lonrho's chief executive, believed initially he could work
with the Fayeds. He had sold them the HoF stake because Lonrho had been
twarted in its hostile bid for Harrods and its parent House of Fraser in
1981 when the Monopolies and Mergers Commission ruled it to be against the
public interest.
Subsequently, Mr Rowland fell out with Fayeds, left the HoF board and Lonrho
bought a new 6 per cent holding in HoF. In March 1985 the Fayeds bid about
Pounds 600m for HoF and Lonrho sold its HoF shares in the market, which were
bought by the Fayeds.
Mr Norman Tebbit, the then Secretary of State for Trade, dropped the 1981
bar on the Lonrho bid - three days after the Fayeds gained control. He
decided not to refer the deal to Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
But the brothers were publicly censured, first by the Department of Trade
and Industry and then last year by the Takeover Panel.
The panel said statements made by the Fayeds during the takeover about their
business interests and income-generating capacity may have created a
misleading impression of their ability to finance the takeover.
The takeover has been the focus of a long-running legal battle between the
Fayeds and Mr Rowland, who has ferociously pursued a campaign against the
brothers. Lonrho still has pending an action against the Fayeds claiming
damages.
Mr Mohammed Fayed and Mr Ali Fayed, his brother, dismissed the panel
conclusions as 'a minor matter' based on the critical report by Department
of Trade inspectors.
But Mr McGowan accepts that it was more unwelcome publicity which
contributed to the poor image of the brothers, which he believes in the main
to be unfair.
'When I was first approached by Warburg (advisers to the stores group) to
become chairman of the House of Fraser, I had, like most people, a number of
preconceived, ill-informed ideas of the Fayeds, most of which turned out to
be wrong.'
He now describes them as 'absolutely charming'.
But as far as Mr McGowan is concerned, the history of the Fayeds is
irrelevant to the impending flotation of the stores which he says are being
kept completely independent from the brothers.
The Fayeds will have no representatives on the board and 'no influence
whatsoever'. If they try to exert any influence over the business Mr McGowan
says he will resign.
However, after getting to know the Fayeds, Mr McGowan is confident that they
will not change their mind over the planned flotation or try to influence
his running of the company.
He nevertheless admits: 'One cannot deny that there is in some quarters a
credibility problem. That is one of the reasons for the long period between
the announcement and the flotation.'
He says he was delighted to find out that the Fayeds invested Pounds 100m in
the stores over the past five years and has satisfied himself that there is
'no black hole'.
House of Fraser has given itself until late spring or summer next year to
put its message across, by which time trading figures for 1993 will be
available.
An adviser to the Fayeds said: 'The two brothers know that they cannot try
and change the terms of Mr McGowan's contract in any way. Mr McGowan does
not have to give any notice if he decides to resign. The brothers know that
if Mr McGowan were to resign and take up fishing again it would be
enormously harmful.'

FT  21 JUL 93 / High job turnover means poor training, says OECD
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COUNTRIES with the highest levels of job mobility are generally failing to
provide adequate training, according to the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development.
In its annual report on employment, published yesterday, the Paris-based
think-tank of 24 industrial nations warns that deregulation of the labour
market can conflict with the goal of a well trained, well paid and stable
workforce.
The report, which makes veiled criticism of labour market developments in
the UK and the US in the 1980s, appears to reflect the influence of the US
administration.
'It seems clear that the major asset of OECD countries is the quality of
their labour,' Mr Tom Alexander, a senior economist at the OECD, said. 'It
is important that that quality is consistently reinforced and renewed.'
The report says young people in France, Germany and Japan, where employment
stability is greater, are more likely to receive formal training than those
in the US, which has a relatively high job turnover.
The US experience of strong employment growth combined with a fall in real
wages for the lowest paid workers 'has given rise to concerns' that jobs can
be bought only at wages that create a class of working poor.
The OECD is also concerned about the rise in the number of part-time and
temporary workers, especially in Europe, some of whom are offered 'only
sub-standard employment and income security'. It found that 20-30 per cent
of part-time workers would prefer a full-time job and that in some European
countries 60-80 per cent of temporary workers are seeking full-time jobs.
The report says it is difficult for countries with a high job turnover to
copy the special relationship between workers and companies found in Japan.
It supports 'industrial relations systems which are structured to enhance
worker participation in the enterprise'.
An analysis of 13 OECD countries found average job tenure to be 8.7 years,
with the US at the bottom end on 6.7 years and Japan at the top with 10.9
years.
Unemployment rates of more than 10 per cent are present in half of the OECD
countries and the overall figure is expected to peak at just under 9 per
cent (36m) in the second half of 1994, a similar percentage to the last peak
in 1983. Unemployment is restraining pay rises with unit labour cost
increases in the business sector slowing to 2.5 per cent in 1992.

FT  21 JUL 93 / The Lex Column: Philip Morris
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The noxious smoke which Philip Morris blew over other consumer products
companies when it first cut the price of Marlboro cigarettes grew thicker
yesterday. Its decision to make the price cuts permanent provoked fresh
fears about brand values.
The UK market, though, appears to have particular trouble peering through
the smog. It knocked the shares of both Unilever and Cadbury-Schweppes,
which are in wholly unrelated businesses, while leaving those of tobacco
giant, BAT Industries, untouched. This may owe something to Philip Morris's
simultaneous decision to raise the price of its discount cigarettes. The
market's reaction seems perverse nonetheless.

FT  21 JUL 93 / The Lex Column: UK economy
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
After last week's good news on industrial production and unemployment, the
deceleration of M4 money supply growth is disconcerting. But the slippage
may not be as serious for recovery as it looks. It reflects a shift in
corporate financing habits, whereby bank debt is being securitised through
the issue of new equity capital or fixed-rate bonds. June alone saw
companies raising some Pounds 3.5bn in the equity market, thanks partly to
the flurry of rights issues from the property sector.
Such balance sheet restructuring bodes well for future economic activity,
especially since consumers show signs of being prepared to borrow again. The
recovery may not be running away with itself, but it is not exactly
faltering either.

FT  21 JUL 93 / The Lex Column: Allied-Lyons/Eldridge
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The deal between Allied-Lyons and Eldridge Pope neatly illustrates the
dilemma facing regional brewers in the UK. Eldridge needs the marketing
muscle of a large brewer such as Allied-Lyons to promote its cask ales
nationally. Without that or some similar arrangement it would not make much
sense to stay in brewing. But in return it is having to open up its retail
network to Carlsberg and Castlemaine lagers, giving Allied's new
Carlsberg-Tetley venture a toe-hold in a region where it is
under-represented. Eventually that could extend to Allied's ales as well.
The prospect of such additional volume serves to make more sense of Allied's
Carlsberg alliance.
The benefits do not, of course, accrue to just one side. Carlsberg-Tetley
will have to compete on price to attract the lager drinkers - they surely
cannot be louts - of Bournemouth and Christchurch. Eldridge Pope will
receive Pounds 6m to invest in its retail estate as well as some additional
contract brewing. In the long run, though, it is difficult to see the
arrangement as a panacea. Eldridge's best hope lies in retailing, not in
struggling to remain in brewing. Its Thomas Hardy and Royal Oak bitters will
be guest ales under Allied's wing. There is a surplus of brands as well as
brewing capacity in the beer market. Some will not survive.

FT  21 JUL 93 / The Lex Column: House of Fraser
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A new chapter will soon be written in House of Fraser's colourful history.
Sadly, it may prove rather dull after what has gone before. Next year, the
company should return to being a respectable listed company with assets of
some Pounds 250m and sales of Pounds 700m. By then, the whiff of cordite
from the infamous Rowland-Fayed feud may have fully blown away. There is
little doubt the flotation reflects the financial pressure on the Fayeds,
however much they may care to window dress the sale. Despite this year's
refinancing, the brothers are still saddled with a mountainous burden of
debt.
That said, House of Fraser has hardly been starved of investment in recent
years. Unlike Harrods, it does not appear to have been subject to the
fanciful whims of its proprietors. Ahead of the flotation, House of Fraser
will be run as an independent company but will face a stiff challenge
overcoming historical prejudice. The pukka presence of Warburg as sponsor
reassures. The surprisingly swift re-emergence of Mr Brian McGowan on the
corporate scene as chairman represents another plus. Fishing, it seems, has
only limited attractions after all.
A price of Pounds 350m-Pounds 550m should be attainable from the flotation -
although this depends on how much debt House of Fraser carries. The toughest
task for management, though, may be persuading investors the company has
much growth potential after five years of flat sales and thin profits.
Department stores have long been viewed as the dinosaurs of the high street.
Yet, Nordstrom in the US has shown there is life in the concept. House of
Fraser has now to show it can be as nimble too.

FT  21 JUL 93 / The Lex Column: SB's patent cure
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Drugs prices can go down as well as up. The prices charged by SmithKline
Beecham to big buyers of managed healthcare in the US were 5 to 10 per cent
lower in the first half of this year than last. Since the company expects
such bulk buyers to account for a rising proportion of sales, price
deflation has further to run even without government intervention. Drugs
prices have fallen this year in Germany and Italy as a result of government
reforms. The chances are that similar measures will follow elsewhere in
Europe.
All credit to SmithKline Beecham, then, for increasing pharmaceutical sales
in both the US and Europe. But not all drugs companies have been blessed
with a stable of promising new products at such a critical moment. Self-help
will be required elsewhere to protect margins and keep earnings on a rising
trend. The Dollars 775m restructuring charge taken by Merck yesterday, and
cuts announced by Marion Merrill Dow last week, will not be the last. Having
been through the pain of merger, SB may have less fat to cut. If a handful
of big buyers soon account for the lion's share of its US sales, though, its
2,000-strong US sales force will look extravagant.
The expiry next year of the US patent on Tagamet, SB's big-selling ulcer
treatment, will be a test. But the impact on earnings should be offset by a
timely currency gain. There is also the promise of an over-the-counter
version of Tagamet. Judging by the performance of the shares during the
great de-rating of the sector, the market now regards SB's consumer
marketing expertise as a useful spread of risks.

FT  21 JUL 93 / VW suffers further setback in legal battle with GM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
VOLKSWAGEN lost more ground in its legal battle with General Motors of the
US when a Hamburg court yesterday permitted publication of further detailed
allegations of industrial espionage by senior executives at the German motor
group.
Der Spiegel, the German news magazine, welcomed the partial lifting of a
temporary injunction, imposed on it last month. It had claimed that Mr Jose
Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, now production and procurement director at VW,
had 'not adhered strictly to the truth' over events surrounding his
departure as a GM director earlier this year.
VW admitted yesterday that the court had 'extensively' accepted the
magazine's claimed right to report suspicions. But it quoted a statement
last week from Mr Harald Ficus, the presiding judge, who told the open
hearing that the court would not make any decisions on the truth or untruth
of the suspicions.
VW shares, which fell last Friday after the oral hearing, dropped DM6.8 to
DM351 yesterday, although the ruling had not been made by the time the
market closed. Traders said the fall was due to US selling by people
speculating on the court's ruling.
Although GM was not directly involved in the civil action, which was heard
last Thursday and ruled on yesterday, the allegations published in the
magazine are at the heart of a criminal investigation being undertaken by
state prosecutors in the light of the US group's accusations.
The court removed the gag preventing reporting of 11 mostly highly
contentious issues. These include the claim central to GM's charges,
reported by Der Spiegel, relating to the alleged removal by Mr Lopez and
several former GM colleagues who followed him to VW of boxes of confidential
GM price lists, secret construction plans and car model studies.
VW responded to the court's findings by pointing out that the magazine
remained gagged on several issues.
The magazine was freed from reporting restrictions on claims, which 'give
the impression or allow the impression to be drawn that Mr Lopez and
colleagues who changed to VW with him took with them any secret GM or Opel
(GM's German subsidiary Adam Opel) documents and delivered them to VW'.
One key to the court's decision lay in evidence presented last week by Mr
John Howell, director of business planning at GM Europe, who 'specifically
remembered' giving Mr Lopez 100-150 documents the day before Mr Lopez
announced his departure.
The documents included details of new models, including a top secret mini,
the O-Car. Mr Lopez told last week's hearing: 'I obtained at my request only
documents concerning the rejected project (for a revolutionary low-cost
production plant) on which I had worked on for a year and a half. As I
remember it was a matter of four charts. These four charts are still in my
office at GM.' GM says searches of offices vacated by Mr Lopez and
colleagues have failed to find any of the secret documents which the US
group claims they had before they left for Germany.

FT  21 JUL 93 / British Gas to freeze prices for householders: Move comes a
week before MMC delivers verdict
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH GAS will freeze prices for its 18m household customers this year
even though the formula which governs its domestic prices shows room for a 1
per cent increase.
Mr Norman Blacker, managing director of British Gas's UK gas business, said
the company would await the outcome of the Monopolies and Mergers Commission
inquiry into the gas industry before deciding the next move on prices. The
commission's verdict is due to be delivered at the end of next week and
British Gas does not want to become involved in a price wrangle before that.
Mr Ian Powe, director of the Gas Consumers' Council, said: 'Only British Gas
would boast about holding monopoly prices steady when the MMC is within a
week of delivering its report. Any other decision would have been
universally condemned.' A complex formula keeps gas price rises 5 percentage
points below the rate of inflation. This would suggest a price cut, but
British Gas said the other part of the formula, which is based on North Sea
gas and other energy prices, allowed the company to raise prices by 1 per
cent.
Sir James McKinnon, director general of Ofgas, the regulator, said the 1 per
cent price increase would have amounted to less than  1/2 p a therm, which
probably would have been swallowed up in administrative costs.
British Gas said it was unlikely to change its prices before the end of the
year. The company normally reviews prices in April and October.
British Gas also published the results of a study by Mori and Gallup
researchers which found that consumers were opposed to standards of service
being jeopardised by price cuts. The company was forced by its regulator to
cut prices twice last year. Ofgas said the company should have known without
commissioning a survey that customers were very satisfied with the service
package conceived by the regulator and agreed by British Gas.
Sir James said: 'Value for money is a combination of price and standards of
service. British Gas cannot now trade service standards at the expense of
price.'
The survey found that 93 per cent of customers oppose cutting spending on
providing instant responses to gas leaks. It found that consumers would be
prepared to pay more to maintain British Gas's responsibilities to the
community as a whole.
British Gas said that a third of its industrial market was supplied by
competitors who served 34 per cent of industrial users - up from 28 per cent
at the end of last year. Rivals had also captured 15 per cent of sales in
the commercial market, which was opened to competition last year.

FT  21 JUL 93 / Fed stresses real interest rates as monetary guide
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US Federal Reserve is putting increased emphasis on real interest rates
as a guide to monetary policy, Mr Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve
chairman, said yesterday in a generally upbeat assessment of US economic
trends.
He warned Congress, however, that financial markets were likely to react
negatively and push up long-term rates if budget negotiations this month
failed to achieve the Clinton administration's goal of Dollars 500bn (Pounds
334bn)in deficit reduction over the next five years.
Mr Greenspan said the US economic recovery appeared to have regained
momentum after a series of setbacks earlier in the year and predicted growth
at an annual rate of close to 3 per cent in the second quarter, after only
0.7 per cent growth in the first quarter. During the year as a whole the
economy was likely to grow by about 2.5 per cent, he said.
Delivering his twice yearly monetary report on Capitol Hill, Mr Greenspan
said the relationships between money and national income and prices had
largely broken down, depriving the monetary aggregates of their usefulness
as guides to policy.
The Fed had thus decided to put increased weight on the level of real
interest rates as a monetary guide-post because of their 'key bearing on
longer-run spending decisions and inflation prospects'.
It was important to prevent real rates moving too far from a long-term
'equilibrium rate' - the rate consistent with steady non-inflationary
growth. If interest rates were held below this level for too long,
inflationary pressures would grow, leading eventually to another economic
contraction, Mr Greenspan warned. In a strong hint that the next move in
short-term rates would be up, he noted that real short rates had been 'in
the neighbourhood of zero' for nine months. Long-term real rates were
appreciably higher, indicating that financial markets expected a rise in
short rates.
Mr Greenspan said the Fed had revised down its growth forecasts to a
'central tendency' of 2.25-2.5 per cent this year compared with a projection
of 3-3.25 per cent in February.
The Fed has also grown more pessimistic on inflation, following sharp price
increases early in the year. The latest forecast is for an increase in the
consumer price index of 3-3.25 per cent this year against a projection of
2.5-2.75 per cent in February.

FT  21 JUL 93 / Pole nominated to take over as EBRD president: Balcerowicz
is only east European to emerge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Financial and Foreign Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Leszek Balcerowicz, the former Polish finance minister, was yesterday
nominated to succeed Mr Jacques Attali as president of the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development, the only east European candidate to emerge
for the post.
Mr Balcerowicz, who was responsible for leading the 'shock therapy'
transition to a market economy under the Mazowiecki government, was
nominated by the Polish government in spite of strong signs that the post
will go to a western candidate.
Nominations for the vacancy, created by Mr Attali's resignation last week,
close today.
Mr Henning Christopherson, the EC economics commissioner, is thought to be
the other of two candidates whose written nomination was received at the
bank's London headquarters yesterday.
The French government, however, has notified Mrs Anne Wibble, the Swedish
finance minister and chairman of the EBRD's board of governors, of the
candidacy of Mr Jacques de Larosiere, governor of the Bank of France. Mr de
Larosiere is regarded as the leading contender.
The French government claims wide international support for Mr de
Larosiere's candidacy, although the prime target of its lobbying has been
fellow EC countries. France has claimed a moral right to field the successor
to Mr Attali, following its 1990 arrangement with Britain that London would
get the bank's site in return for France providing the EBRD's president.
Ms Hanna Gronkiewicz-Waltz, the Polish central bank chairman, submitted Mr
Balcerowicz's nomination yesterday afternoon, pointing out in her letter
that no candidate from eastern or central Europe had yet been considered.
Since he left the finance ministry in 1991 Mr Balcerowicz has stuck to
academia, although he has advised the Ukrainian and Lithuanian governments
on economic reform. He is a supporter of strict monetarist discipline.
Although he was praised by western governments for steering Poland through
the most difficult part of its economic reforms after 1989, his candidacy
faces difficulty in gaining widespread support from western governments.
But political sources in Warsaw yesterday pointed out Ms Gronkiewicz-Waltz
would not have gone ahead if the west had been united on a single candidate.
They also claimed there had been encouragement from the US and 'World Bank
circles'.
Mr Christophersen's candidacy enjoys broad support among the Scandinavian
and Mediterranean countries, but he has yet to receive clear support from
Germany, according to EC officials in Brussels.

FT  21 JUL 93 / Leading Article: Clarifying the green agenda
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
RECESSION AND growing awareness of the cost of implementing the world's
green aspirations have pushed environmental concerns down the political
agenda. After a decade of enthusiasm for regulation and international deals
on the environment, it is a time for priorities.
The best reason for acting in environmental questions is when there is a
risk to health and safety. Many environmentalists go further, arguing that a
duty exists to preserve the environment for posterity, whether or not health
is at risk. Lady Thatcher spoke of this generation's responsibility for a
'full repairing lease' on the planet in her 1988 speech to the Royal
Society.
That approach, captured in the notion of 'sustainable development', is
problematic. Many economists find it incoherent, since consumption of
perishable, non-renewable resources, such as oil, cannot be sustained
indefinitely. At its purest, the notion of 'sustainability' amounts to a
plea for conservation for its own sake, be it of whales or of particular
habitats, like rainforests. This position enjoys public support,
particularly in rich countries. But governments should carefully distinguish
conservation from concern about threats to people's physical well-being.
They should also be clear about the price they are willing to pay for the
preservation of blue skies or rare animals.
If health and safety are to be put first, global warming, the subject of one
of the two treaties at the Rio summit last year, should be viewed as the
most important single global risk. The threat of a rise in the planet's
temperature from growing concentrations of carbon dioxide and methane in the
atmosphere has not yet been proven: some scientists believe that clouds and
the oceans might counteract the change. Nevertheless, warming would cause
widespread social and agricultural disruption, if it were to occur, while
achieving better knowledge will take decades of research. Given the slowness
of international negotiations on curbing emissions as well, the issue should
be tackled urgently.
Rio sidestepped other important questions, notably population growth, to
which more attention should be paid. Similarly, it gave little time to trade
questions, though recent challenges to the proposed North American free
trade agreement and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade show how
environmental worries may lead to protectionism.
But the environmental concerns that merit attention are not only global
ones. Governments should also pay attention to local miseries. Urban air
pollution, for example, is suspected of causing rising asthma levels.
Equally important are contaminated land and mismanaged rubbish tips, while
noise is among the main complaints in rich countries and polluted water in
poor ones.
Nevertheless, not all environmental concerns deserve the attention they are
given. Ozone layer depletion, for example, poses far less of a threat than
global warming. Now that curbs on many of the chemicals responsible are in
place, ozone levels will correct themselves naturally over decades.
Governments should also cast a sceptical eye over recycling and renewable
energy. Those two issues have become a moral crusade for the green movement.
Yet their economics and even their environmental benefits are questionable.
Arguably, the most overblown issue of all is preservation of biodiversity,
the number and distribution of species, which was the subject of Rio's
second treaty. Maybe plants deep in tropical jungles contain hitherto
unknown medicines. But the sensible response is to catalogue the species and
preserve some of each, in a modern-day Noah's Ark.
Choices need to be made. If environmentalists insist that all things green
are equally important, they are likely to lose their influence. If
governments are distracted by items of minor importance from the
campaigners' agenda, they will not be effective. Sound environmental policy
requires clearly stated priorities.

FT  21 JUL 93 / Leading Article: Rough justice
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN THE history of Italy's corruption scandals comes to be written,
Gabriele Cagliari may occupy a special place. In apparently killing himself
in a Milan jail, the former ENI chairman has shone a grim light on the
magistrates' ever-expanding investigations into links between politics and
business. What is exposed is scarcely a picture of justice. Cagliari had
been held for 133 days on a range of charges on which he could normally have
expected bail. The magistrates are accused of trying to force him into
self-incrimination. It is hard to escape the impression that what the
Italian judiciary calls 'preventive detention' has become a severe
infringement of citizens' rights.
Hitherto, the widespread assumption has been that the vigorous means adopted
by the magistrates were justified by the end: breaking the rotten system
under which Italy has been governed for the last four decades. The question
now is whether they have gone too far. To ask this is not to suggest
systematic injustice: the people who have walked into the investigators' net
are by admission almost all guilty of misdemeanours from making illegal
party contributions to extortion.
But the process still leaves an uncomfortable impression. It is being
carried out amid a welter of press leaks that seem to presume guilt and
offer suspects no public opportunity to defend themselves. Moreover, the
magistrates' zeal in bringing accusations is not matched by an expeditious
judicial system. Prosecutions can take 10 years to come to trial and, when
they do, a staggering 75 per cent fail. At this rate, the courts will still
be digesting current investigations long after many more of the culprits
have died.
The problem - for the magistrates as much as for their suspects - is that
Italian justice is currently operating in a political vacuum. An entire
system is on trial, not just a few hundred corrupt politicians and
businessmen, and the current legislature is too discredited to come up with
a workable political solution. This week's events merely reinforce the
pressing need for fresh elections and comprehensive constitutional reform.
But until a new parliament with such a mandate is in place, the judiciary
will have to strike a more careful balance than it has of late between
prosecuting the guilty and respecting the rights of the individual.

Radio buttons will soon be too hot to handle. Into the franchise ring step
Dame Shirley Porter, who quit politics and became chairman of LBC, and
Charlie Cox, until recently LBC's managing director.
Yesterday, Cox turned up as managing director of The London Radio Company,
which is hell-bent on ousting LBC from its frequencies.
So LBC promptly called its lawyers. It claimed that Cox, once the youngest
manager of a large metropolitan radio station in Australia, and who resigned
a week before LBC's application for new licences was delivered to the Radio
Authority, had given legal undertakings not to do anything to help any LBC
competitor.
But Bert Hardy, chairman of The London Radio Company whose heavyweight
investors include Associated Newspapers, Reuters and Independent Television
News, says Cox is only prevented from helping a rival until September. 'He's
off to Australia on holiday,' says Hardy. It just so happens that the
franchises will be awarded in September or October.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
While Westminster ponders Maastricht, the Foreign Office is abuzz with the
pithier little matter of who moves into the permanent undersecretary of
state's gracious seat next August.
Sir David Gillmore, whose rather unusual path to the top of the diplomatic
service included three years at Reuters as well as a spell teaching for the
Inner London Education Authority in the late 1960s, has been in place since
1991.
A highly popular but unflashy PUS, he briefly leapt to the limelight last
September administering the very public wigging of the former German
ambassador amid the ERM turmoil. Gillmore doesn't turn 60 until August 1994,
but the FCO hates to be rushed and four names are already in the air.
Sir Robin Renwick, 55, the British ambassador credited with restoring
relations after the saga of Clinton's passport during the presidential
election, has been mentioned, as has Sir John Kerr, 51, permanent
representative to the EC in Brussels. Sir Nigel Broomfield, 56, ambassador
in Bonn, has the advantage of knowing Gillmore from Moscow in the early
1970s. And there is Sir John Weston, 55, the UK permanent representative to
Nato.
Meanwhile Sir David Hannay, the all-star permanent representative to the UN,
is not thought a likely contender. The FCO is certainly keen to reward him
for his time in New York but, at 58, he may be a shade too old.
The current betting is on Weston. Renwick will be left where he shines, in
the field; and Kerr, who has done his best in the uphill task of keeping
Britain at the heart of Europe for three years, is young enough to have
another crack at the best job in Whitehall.

The government's assault on red tape, which yesterday yielded a mere 217
pages of report by the 'efficiency scrutiny team', was off to a bad start
when ministers flatly rejected one of its key proposals - the creation of a
national red tape quango.
Nor will the country's embattled small businessmen be exactly cheered by
John Gummer's selfless proposals for tape-cutting at the Department of the
Environment. Earmarked for immediate attention are several Seal Fishery
Acts, which principally affect Canadian fisherman in the north Pacific.

FT  21 JUL 93 / Observer: Saab trolls for elks
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Fingers crossed today that Keith Butler-Wheelhouse will turn up on time for
the all-important launch of the new Saab 900 model. The genial Brit, who was
brought in by part-owners General Motors last year to drive the beleaguered
Swedish car maker out of the woods, admits to having got lost there himself
last week. Turning up at work an uncharacteristic 45 minutes late, he
explained that he and his dog on their morning run had strayed by 6kms
through the forest near the company's home town of Trollhattan.
The presence of Butler-Wheelhouse - who led the management buy-out of GM's
South African operation eight years ago - and of the American John Fleming
in the marketing role testifies to the concern at GM, 50 per cent owner with
the Wallenberg family since 1989, that Saab should finally turn the corner
after four years of deep losses.
To this end and with its home market very much in mind, the new 900 was
tested on its ability to withstand collisions with elks - a not infrequent
occurrence on Swedish roads. Saab engineers insist that there is no safer
car on the road when it comes to a head-on encounter with a large deer. But
what about Saab's other cherished reputation - for producing the world's
greenest, as well as safest car? Don't worry, the engineers say. We used a
dummy elk.

FT  21 JUL 93 / No easy answers to job questions: Rising employment and wage
flexibility have gone hand in hand in America's market economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It may seem ironic that President Bill Clinton has taken the lead in
proposing an international 'jobs summit' this autumn. Many of his Group of
Seven colleagues would regard the current US unemployment rate as a mark of
success rather than failure.
In the recession, the US jobless rate peaked at less than 8 per cent. It has
already fallen to 7 per cent, well below the double-digit rates projected
for much of the European Community. By EC standards, the US barely
understands the meaning of the phrase 'long-term unemployment': according to
OECD figures, in 1991 (a recession year) only 6 per cent of the jobless in
north America were out of work for 12 months or more, against nearly 50 per
cent in the European Community.
The US's job creation record over the past two decades, meanwhile, is often
cited as a classic illustration of the virtues of flexible labour markets.
In spite of temporary setbacks during recessions, non-farm employment has
grown at a staggering pace: from 71m in 1971 to 110m this June, an increase
of 55 per cent.
No other large industrial country has come near to matching this
performance. The US generated jobs twice as quickly as Japan over this
period and more than five times as rapidly as leading European economies
such as Germany, France and Britain.
And nearly all the job growth in the US was in the private sector. Until the
mid-1980s, when private sector employment began to expand slowly, most
European jobs were created by public-sector agencies and thus financed by
higher taxes.
Yet the Clinton administration draws little comfort from this impressive
record. Far from considering his own labour market as a paragon of virtue,
Mr Clinton frets that:
The jobs miracle may be over - US employment has barely increased in three
years;
Real wages have grown very slowly for two decades, raising doubts about the
quality of jobs;
Pay differentials are growing, leading to unprecedented inequality of family
incomes.
Behind these specific worries lies an inchoate fear: that increasingly
fierce competition from east Asia and parts of Latin America is reducing the
proportion of Americans that can afford the trappings of a 'middle-class'
lifestyle, such as a vacation home and college education for their children.
The point was brought home in a recent speech by Mr Richard Gephardt, the
Democratic leader in the House of Representatives. He recalled visiting a
Sanyo plant in Tijuana, Mexico, which manufactures circuit boards for TV
sets. The workers apparently achieved higher quality and productivity than
their counterparts in Sanyo's Japanese or US plants, yet earned only about
Dollars 1 an hour.
The moral he drew was that Dollars 1 an hour labour in countries such as
Mexico or China 'can equal or surpass our labour in simple or very
complicated manufacturing tasks'. In other words, in an intensification of
the trends of the 1980s, foreign competition might drive down the wages even
of highly skilled American factory workers.
Worries about the quantity - as opposed to the quality - of US jobs seem
exaggerated. By the standards of past business cycles, jobs are admittedly
being created slowly during the present recovery: employment has only just
surpassed the pre-recession peak reached in the summer of 1990. But many
pundits forget that labour force growth has also slowed down.
Provided wages can adjust, in a market economy there is usually a close
relation between the growth of the labour force (the numbers seeking jobs)
and growth of employment. Between 1971 and 1990 the US created far more jobs
than any other industrial economy, largely because of unusually intense
demographic pressures: the arrival in the workforce of the outsized 'baby
boom' generation, the shift of women into paid employment and substantial
immigration - 6m people entered the US in the 1980s alone, the largest
influx since the early years of the century.
The most striking difference between the US and Europe today is that few
Americans fear severe structural unemployment. Most forecasters - including
the Clinton administration - expect a cyclical economic recovery to reduce
the unemployment rate to 5.5-6.0 per cent by 1996, which is not far above
most estimates of 'full employment'.
In some respects such projections create a misleading impression. Jobless
rates in the US tend to be below those in Europe partly because only about
60 per cent of the jobless qualify for unemployment insurance. Benefits are
worth only about a third of previous earnings, compared with more like
two-thirds in continental Europe. And they last only six months, except in
recessions when temporary extensions are granted.
This means that many jobless Americans drift out of the labour market and
are classified as 'economically inactive' rather than unemployed. The
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development has calculated
'non-employment' rates (which consist of the officially jobless plus the
inactive) that cast a less favourable light on US labour markets. During the
1980s, 12 per cent of men aged 25-54 were not in the formal labour market,
compared with an average of just over 11 per cent in 16 large industrial
countries. Withdrawal from the labour market is an especially severe problem
for poor young men in inner cities.
But if the availability of jobs (except in recessions) is often taken for
granted, nearly all US pundits are preoccupied with two alleged
manifestations of the low quality of much of the service-sector employment
created in the 1980s: the slow pace of real wage growth and the rising
inequality of family incomes. Since 1973, hourly compensation (wages plus
fringe benefits) has increased by only about 11 per cent after allowing for
inflation, or little more than 0.5 per cent a year, a far slower pace than
in most other industrialised countries. The disappointing performance of
real wages has to be seen, however, as a quid pro quo for the exceptional
growth of employment since the early 1970s. In some ways it is surprising
that real wages rose at all.
Nevertheless, the US is the only leading industrialised country where many
low-income workers have experienced substantial real pay cuts. After
adjusting for inflation, the hourly wages of men with 12 or fewer years of
schooling fell about 20 per cent between 1979 and 1989. During the same
period comparable workers in the UK experienced a 12 per cent increase in
inflation-adjusted earnings.
According to a study by Mr Lawrence Katz, chief economist at the US
department of labour, and Mr Richard Freeman of Harvard University, the
growing discrepancy between the wages of high- and low-skilled workers in
the 1980s has contributed to levels of income inequality unprecedented in
postwar US history and without parallel in other advanced economies. During
the 1980s, the real incomes of the richest 20 per cent of families rose
about 20 per cent while those of the bottom 40 per cent were static.
The UK was the only other country to experience a sharp rise in inequality.
Katz and Freeman found no evidence of increasing wage inequality in Germany
or the Netherlands and only a slight increase in differentials in countries
as diverse as France, Sweden, Japan and Australia.
Yet all industrialised countries have had to cope with the same structural
changes, such as a secular shift in the composition of output from
manufacturing to services and stiffer competition from low-wage producers in
the developing world. So why has wage inequality risen faster in the US (and
to a lesser extent Britain) than elsewhere?
Part of the answer may lie in differences on the supply side of labour
markets. In both the US and the UK, the rate of expansion of higher
education slowed significantly in the 1980s as compared with the 1970s. So
the rate of growth in the supply of highly educated workers declined. Yet
the relative demand for highly educated workers if anything grew faster,
reflecting the export of low-skilled jobs to developing countries.
In the US, the supply-demand imbalance contributed to a sharp increase in
the wage premium for college-educated workers. In countries such as Germany
and France, where the relative supply of highly educated workers was better
maintained in the 1980s, the pay of college-educated workers did not rise to
anything like the same extent.
Katz and Freeman also note that the US and Britain saw a much sharper
contraction of union membership than most other industrialised countries. In
the US, where unionised workers enjoy wage rates 20-25 per cent above those
in non-organised plants, the decline in union membership in the 1980s may
have accounted for as much as a fifth of the total rise in wage inequality
in the decade.
But this is not the whole story. In the US pay has grown more unequal even
among employees with the same qualifications in the same industries subject
to the same labour laws. For example, pay rates for lawyers vary more than
they once did. This broader trend may reflect attempts by US companies to
become more competitive by linking pay much more closely to individual
performance, which is often only loosely related to formal qualifications
and job titles. In most other countries, there are many formal and informal
obstacles to such an individualistic approach: in effect the more productive
are obliged to subsidise the less productive.
For many Europeans, US labour markets will seem an unattractive role model.
Stagnant real wages, rising inequality and limited job security will strike
many as a high - perhaps unacceptable - price to pay for relatively low
jobless rates. Many Americans are deeply troubled by such trends: Mr Clinton
won last year's presidential election in large part by capitalising on the
feelings of insecurity created by the Darwinian labour markets of the 1980s.
His formula for restoring the 'American dream' of steadily rising living
standards for middle-income families involved heavy reliance on 'social
democratic' policies that in the EC are now increasingly seen as the cause
of labour market rigidities. Mr Clinton signalled he would help low-income
families by raising the minimum wage substantially and debated the merits of
new payroll taxes to pay for social reforms, such as universal healthcare
and more extensive industrial training. His agenda also included giving
workers a stronger 'voice' in corporate decision-making, especially in the
non-unionised sector.
Yet as he learns more about the potential costs of interventionist labour
market policies in the EC, Mr Clinton may find himself counting the
blessings of the US's more flexible system. If he borrows from Europe it
will be in uncontroversial ways, for example by upgrading US vocational
education, easing the school-to-work transition for non-academic students
and improving 'active labour market policies', such as counselling and
retraining services for the unemployed.
But the EC can possibly learn a great deal from the US. The most important
lesson is that in a dynamic, open market economy, some sectors will always
be in relative decline. There will thus always be downward pressure on the
relative (and sometimes absolute) wages of some groups of workers. If these
pressures are resisted indefinitely, it is hardly surprising if the result
is an insupportable level of structural unemployment.
If there is a cure for pain inflicted by low-wage competition from the likes
of China and Mexico, it probably lies in a policy that all governments
endorse yet on which few can show much tangible progress: improvements in
the quality of education and training that raise the productivity of the
workforce. But as the timescale involves decades rather than years, such
improvements cannot be expected to serve as a substitute for greater wage
flexibility.

FT  21 JUL 93 / Leading Article: Red tape
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
EXCESSIVE regulation imposes unseen costs on business that raise prices,
stifle innovation and lose jobs. In February, the prime minister launched a
crusade against the red tape that appears to be engulfing the UK. Six months
on, little has yet been achieved, though some worthwhile initiatives were
launched at yesterday's Downing Street seminar on deregulation.
Certainly if the list of deregulation measures put forward by departments is
anything to go by, Mr Major's crusade is flagging. Campaigners against
growing red tape have more in their sights than allowing shops to stay open
later or creating more 'family pubs'. The environment department's promise
to repeal the Seal Fisheries Acts will not impress small businesses
wrestling with the complexities of environmental legislation. As for the
transport department, top of its list of deregulation measures is a green
paper on regulating mini-cabs - hitherto unregulated. This is the
traditional Whitehall approach of selling departmental priorities under the
guise of the latest prime ministerial initiative.
Some useful ground-clearing measures were agreed yesterday. Around 400
regulations have been targeted for further scrutiny. A deregulation bill is
promised for the next session of parliament. Future regulations will be
tested for their impact on small businesses and whether their costs are
commensurate with the benefits. There will also be encouragement for
legislators to specify the outcome of actions rather than attempting to
control the details of business processes.
All of this is welcome, but whether it is successful in cutting through red
tape will depend on how it is implemented. The people who drew up
yesterday's unconvincing lists of deregulation measures may not be the best
people to entrust with this task. A report supervised by the Cabinet Office
Efficiency Unit proposed a commission to give deregulation much greater
clout. The government has sensibly rejected such a quango - creating another
bureaucracy to fight bureaucracy would be particularly inappropriate. But
the deregulation drive needs a stronger push with the prime minister's
active participation. A special Cabinet Office unit to co-ordinate action is
called for, modelled on Sir Peter Levene's highly successful Efficiency
Unit.

FT  21 JUL 93 / Letters to the Editor: Tax-efficient pay rises ease
unemployment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From PETER DUBOFF
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I read with interest your editorial, 'Changeable forecasts' (July 17),
and would like to expand upon a theory as to why the two key indicators -
retail price inflation and unemployment - have recently been so favourable.
I specialise in the activity known as profit-related pay, an area of tax
legislation designed to motivate employees by relating a proportion of their
pay to company profits, with that profit-related element being paid without
deduction of tax. The untaxed element can be up to 20 per cent of gross pay,
or Pounds 4,000, whichever is lower.
Over the last year, virtually every profitable business employing more than
30 staff has either put in place a PRP scheme or is actively considering it
for its next financial year. This is because, in most cases, an
appropriately devised PRP scheme can effectively substitute up to 20 per
cent of existing salaried pay with tax-free profit-related pay without
recourse to movements in the company's profits. This will have the effect of
providing employees earning up to Pounds 20,000 per annum with pay increases
of up to 5 per cent net or gross equivalent increases of 7.5 per cent at no
cost to the company.
Businesses are actively introducing PRP at a time when they would normally
otherwise have offered a pay rise in lieu. In other cases, where industries
are hit by recession or where employers are more greedy, staff are being
asked to accept gross pay reductions of up to 5 per cent while still being
promised higher net salaries.
This can allow an employer to avoid making redundancies that would otherwise
have been necessary.
More than 1.2m employees were in PRP schemes by March 1993 and their number
is likely to have increased substantially since then. While the impact that
PRP is having on wage inflation and unemployment figures is healthy, one
should be aware of the corollary effect it is having on tax revenues
collected through the PAYE system.

FT  21 JUL 93 / Strategy to win a sea battle: How a civilian shipyard helped
VSEL cut costs and gain a Royal Navy order
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When two of the UK's biggest shipbuilders competed for the same Royal Navy
contract recently, one of them had to emerge the winner. But for Tyneside's
Swan Hunter and VSEL of Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria, there was more at stake
than one helicopter carrier.
After the Ministry of Defence rejected Swan Hunter's Pounds 220m bid in May,
the receiver was called in and 2,200 workers face unemployment. The MoD's
acceptance of VSEL's bid, cheaper by about Pounds 50m, gave the UK's
specialist submarine builder a re-entry into surface ships after a decade's
absence.
Now the National Audit Office, the government spending watchdog, has been
asked by the House of Commons defence committee to check if the competition
was fair. It is expected to report next week on how the two companies, with
more than two centuries of shipbuilding experience between them, came to
offer bids of such disparity.
The answer is likely to stem from the different approach each company took
to meeting the navy's needs.
Swan Hunter wanted to do all the work itself, and estimated that building
the ship would consume 7,000 man years (the amount of work done by one
worker in one year). VSEL, by contrast, divided the work into navy and
civilian parts, and gave the merchant parts to a civilian shipbuilder,
Kvaerner Govan. VSEL and Kvaerner Govan say they need fewer than 2,500 man
years to build virtually the same ship.
Although the rival bids were for similar ships, the thinking behind each
design differed. While Swan Hunter believed the ship was entirely military,
VSEL thought the design was basically a merchant ship with military hardware
bolted on.
The difference between a warship and a merchant ship is more than a matter
of guns and engines. Military ships are more technologically demanding.
Their reliability must be higher, with vital components protected from the
shock of battle. They need computerised fire management and back-up
electronics to make it more likely that control and communications systems
would survive attack.
In a warship, this equipment is packed in hulls made from ultra-thin metal
plating to reduce weight, even though welding thin metal is slow and
difficult work.
Not surprisingly, navy ships are expensive: a small frigate costs between
Pounds 100m and Pounds 150m, more than twice the price of the costliest of
merchant ships.
Unusually, the MoD's specification for the helicopter carrier did not call
for a normal warship, but was a hybrid of military and civilian components.
The hull is to be of merchant standard, but many of the fittings are
military.
This combination posed a problem for VSEL and Swan Hunter, both essentially
navy suppliers, although Swan Hunter has in recent years tried to broaden
its skills.
The Swan Hunter yard has a long and illustrious history in the commercial
sector: in 1907 it built the Mauretania liner, one of the largest liners of
its time, and merchant ships were big business in the 1960s. This ended when
the yard was consigned to making warships as part of the nationalised
British Shipbuilders in 1977-86.
But it had recently returned to building some merchant ships after almost
two decades devoted to warships. Since privatisation seven years ago, it has
won contracts to build cranes for the offshore oil industry, a River Tyne
ferry and a ship designed to work in the Antarctic. The number of its
merchant contracts peaked at one-quarter of its workload in the early 1990s.
Last year, management felt able to say it had the UK's only design team with
the experience and expertise to build both warships and merchant vessels.
VSEL, by contrast, has concentrated on defence work, largely Trident
submarines. So it decided that the merchant ship aspects of the helicopter
carrier - at least half the work of building the ship - could be done by a
yard with no navy experience.
The result was a plan to build a hull, helicopter platform and engines. This
structure would qualify as a merchant ship and be built to merchant
standards set by Lloyd's Register, the ship classification society. It would
then sail to Barrow-in-Furness to have military kit fitted.
As prime contractor, VSEL picked its subcontractor carefully. Kvaerner Govan
has been owned by one of Europe's most successful merchant shipbuilders,
Norway's Kvaerner Industrier, since 1988.
The yard, on Clydeside, has for several years been building gas carriers,
which are among the more advanced merchant ships on the seas. The safety
standards needed in gas carriers mean that Kvaerner Govan is more
experienced than some other merchant yards at the specialised welding and
automated disaster management systems that would be useful for the
helicopter carrier.
The MoD specifications for the helicopter carrier are, in some areas, less
exacting than Kvaerner Govan's standards for gas carriers. The helicopter
carrier's welds need be checked with X-rays only at random points, according
to Kvaerner Govan. The welds on gas tanker hulls, however, must pass a
comprehensive X-ray examination.
With the help of its parent, Kvaerner Govan has invested Pounds 35m in
equipment to cut costs. This is on top of the public money that went into
the yard before 1988 when it was owned by the nationalised British
Shipbuilders. It hopes to break even this year for the first time under
Kvaerner Industrier's control.
This investment is underlined by equipment differences between Swan Hunter
and Kvaerner Govan. Both build sections of ships under cover to improve
productivity: work can continue during bad weather, and workers perform
better in the warm and dry. But Kvaerner Govan can build much more under
shelter than Swan Hunter. Most of the Pounds 35m went on covered units for
ship sections weighing up to 1,500 tonnes, more than seven times the size
possible in Swan Hunter's covered units.
These differences alone could account for a substantial difference in costs
between the yards. But beyond them, there are long-standing structural
differences between merchant ship and warship builders in general that could
widen the gap further.
Warship yards acknowledge that they cost more to run. 'If you gave a
merchant shipyard a warship contract, it would be cheaper than if you gave
the same contract to a navy yard,' says Mr Bob Mulligan, technical director
at Vosper Thornycroft, a Southampton-based naval shipyard.
The reason is that a navy yard has higher overheads than civilian rivals,
says GEC, which owns the Yarrow navy yard, on the River Clyde. Extra staff
are needed to oversee the development, construction and installation of each
part of a warship, such as hull, early warning systems and weapons, and
report to opposite numbers in the MoD.
'Across all defence production there is a much greater requirement for
liaison between the manufacturer and the customer. They (the military) want
a detailed breakdown of overheads and work done in regular progress
reports,' says GEC. 'A commercial yard does not need to have those people in
place.'
In the past, the impact of such structural differences on costs has not been
tested, because merchant and warship yards have not competed for the same
contracts. Now the helicopter carrier experiment may have set a precedent
for future MoD contracts.
Indeed, the MoD is determined to press ahead with further contracts mixing
defence and civil components, whatever the National Audit office report
says.
'This was not a one-off,' says the MoD. 'The result is that there will be
rewards for industry, but there will be increased risk too.' Deals combining
military and civilian contractors are part, it says, of its policy to pass
on the risk from taxpayers to suppliers.

FT  21 JUL 93 / Letters to the Editor: Relocation move means double taxation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JOHN W SPIRLING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The Treasury will have surpassed itself with the efficiency of
impending legislation which will not only raise a tax, but also a tax on a
tax. This is the inevitable result of the only option left to major
companies relocating employees after the government's proposed new tax on
relocation expenses is implemented.
Responsible companies pay only the expenses necessary to achieve a rapid
relocation, the employee not being out of pocket. Typically, the cost of
this (including agent's fees, solicitor's fees, duty charges, bridging
costs, etc) is more than double the Pounds 8,000 non-taxable limit suggested
by the chancellor in March.
From August the employee will be required to pay tax on expenses in excess
of this limit. In reality the employer will pay the employee an additional
amount sufficient to meet both the cost of the tax and the tax on the
additional amount.
The net result? Companies are doubly taxed on a necessary expense.
Expanding, multi-location companies are disproportionately penalised. Is
this really the most appropriate way to increase government income?

FT  21 JUL 93 / Letters to the Editor: Matters of record regarding council
leader's resignation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Councillor DAVID WEEKS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, You carried an article by John Authers on July 15 about Westminster
City Council ('Troubles mount for Tory council'). May I put on record three
points. In particular, Mr Authers said that the council's managing director,
Mr Montacute, refused to publish certain letters. Mr Authers did not ask me
if he could see them. Had he done so I would have made them available to
him.
My resignation statement makes clear that I resigned as leader of the
council 'as a result of political disagreements over my approach to the
council's management'. Other reasons which you have suggested were not
relevant.
With regard to the housing policy of designated sales, this is in full
operation and is one of our most popular policies among our council tenants.
At the last council meeting tenants of a further estate requested that they,
too, should be allowed to have 'designated sales' status.
I cannot anticipate what the district auditor may report on the subject.
What I can tell you is that the council obtained the advice of leading
counsel about it on three different occasions: in 1987, when the policy was
first implemented; in 1989 when the Labour party first made the allegations
that you described; and in 1993, in the light of new papers which have been
requested by the district auditor. On every occasion the QC confirmed that
the policy was legal.
No action has been taken following the raid on my office by the managing
director because no action was needed. Only 11 sheets of paper were
involved; they were all perfectly legal.

former leader of the council,

Sir, David Buchan's article on homegrown petrol concludes with the assertion
that some EC member states are less than enthusiastic about biofuels because
of their adverse environmental and industrial effects ('France samples
homegrown petrol', July 15).
While this is undoubtedly true, at a time of burgeoning deficits, a loss of
tax revenue of up to Pounds 3bn across the Community, plus a slightly
smaller sum in other agricultural support costs, may also cross their minds.

FT  21 JUL 93 / Limits of world order
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD MORTIMER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'If it ain't broke, don't fix it,' said Mr Douglas Hurd, UK foreign
secretary, last January, answering a question about the membership of the UN
Security Council. The system was working well. The existing five permanent
members had at last found the cohesion necessary to play the role assigned
them by the United Nations Charter. So why risk paralysing the council by
introducing new members, especially since it would be very difficult to know
where to stop?
No doubt the case for admitting Germany and Japan was strong, based on their
economic importance - though they would have to match that with a bolder and
more direct role in world security if their candidature were to be taken
seriously. (A pause at this point for the British and French to thump their
chests: Our troops are in the Gulf, Bosnia, etc. Where are yours?)
But don't imagine that the two-thirds majority in the General Assembly
required for amendment of the charter would be available for two extra
permanent members from the rich north, unless the poor south's importance
were also recognised. We should find ourselves enlarging the council's
membership to 20 or more, and giving vetoes to problematic countries like
India and Brazil, or even Indonesia and Nigeria. Where would your new world
order be then?
I paraphrase, of course. Indeed, I caricature. But that has been the gist of
the British argument for opposing change. There are two things wrong with
it.
First, it is too self-serving. Britain's interest - or at least the interest
of the UK foreign office - in preserving the trappings of being a great
power long after the reality has gone is too obvious for the merits of the
case to command attention.
The case sounded much more persuasive than it ever has in the mouths of
British ministers or diplomats when, last week, it was put by a young German
scholar, Marc Weller of the Cambridge Research Centre for International Law,
arguing against his own country's campaign for permanent membership.
The second problem is that its main premise is dubious. Are we sure that the
UN Security Council 'ain't broke'?
It is true that the vehicle is now in motion, with one great power firmly in
the driving seat, which is better than when it was immobilised by rival
drivers yanking on the hand brake. But the steering column looks
increasingly ropey, the needle on the petrol gauge is well into the red, and
many of the passengers have no confidence in the man at the wheel. Should we
wait until it has ground to a halt again, or careered right off the road,
before attempting an overhaul?
Many things about the UN need to be re-thought. The membership of the
Security Council is only one of them, and perhaps not the most directly
relevant to immediate problems. More countries with vetoes may well not be
the answer, and certainly an increase in the weight of rich countries at the
expense of poor ones would make things worse. If the number of permanent
members is to be increased, the veto should either be scrapped and replaced
with a system of weighted voting, or there should be provision for an
override when the majority is large enough.
First, though, we should all think harder about what we actually want the
Security Council to do. Its primary responsibility under the charter is 'the
maintenance of international peace and security'. It has no direct
responsibility for the maintenance of peace and security within states and
it is not equipped for that task. It has slid into it for three reasons:
War and insecurity within states have a tendency to spread across
international frontiers, for example in the cases of Cambodia and Iraq.
In many conflicts which start within states the existence of the state or
its frontiers becomes the central issue, as is the case with Yugoslavia.
Public opinion in western countries, which at present dominate the council,
no longer feels that its responsibility to try to halt bloodshed stops at
the frontiers of a sovereign state, since images of bloodshed and misery now
leap across frontiers and oceans into every western living-room.
No man is an island. That is perhaps more true today than when John Donne
said it. The urge to 'do something' is natural and admirable. But to act on
it is frivolous and irresponsible unless we first measure the size of the
task and forge instruments capable of performing it.
To restore order and rebuild society in countries where it has completely
broken down requires sizeable armies and the will to use them. It requires
confiscation of sovereignty and the imposition of external rule - temporary,
no doubt, but measured in years rather than months. Either a single country
has to undertake this task - that was the old way, but is any country now
willing to do it? - or a supranational authority has to be set up specially
for the purpose, with procedures and chains of command carefully worked out.
If anyone asked me to take charge of Somalia, for instance, I should want a
very broad mandate, authority to hire and fire all UN personnel within the
country, both civilian and military, and to use force against any local
group that challenged my rule. I should want a guaranteed budget and at
least a three-year term, to be shortened only by a unanimous vote of the
council.
I rather doubt if I should get it. If I did, how could I guarantee that
mayhem would not again break out on my departure, as it did in so many
countries when imperial rule came to an end?

Sir, Leslie Crawford, in her article, 'Rising death toll stokes Somali
hatred against UN' (July 14), gives a lucid and impartial account of the
tragic events in Mogadishu and of the causes of them.
What should possibly be added as a comment is the urgent need to reform the
structure of the United Nations - in the light of the radical changes that
have occurred on the world political scene - giving more powers to the
general assembly.
Should this not take place, the organisation will remain, as it undoubtedly
is today, nothing more than a screen behind which the US hides the most
controversial aspects of its foreign policy. This will lead many emerging
countries of the world to share a feeling of suspicion and mistrust towards
what will increasingly be regarded as a hypocritical international tool.

FT  21 JUL 93 / Arts: Air of limbo in Munich - At the Opera Festival Andrew
Clark reviews two new Bavarian State Opera productions of Strauss and
Shostakovich
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After a year on the move, while algae were removed from the expensive new
hydraulics system in Munich's National Theater, the Bavarian State Opera is
back in its home for the July opera festival, specially extended this year
to six-and-a-half weeks. Wolfgang Sawallisch has gone, Peter Jonas has yet
to arrive. Despite the pleasure of being back in familiar surroundings,
there is an air of limbo. That much was clear from Die Frau ohne Schatten
and Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk, which - along with La traviata, to be staged
later this week by the avant-garde director Gunter Kramer - are the
festival's new productions.
The Strauss was new to Munich, but was first seen last November during the
company's tour of Japan. Its prime motivator was Sawallisch, whose long
association with Japan and admiration for its culture prompted the idea of a
Kabuki interpretation - at first sight quite plausible, given the opera's
pseudo-oriental setting. By the time the production reached Munich, however,
it had lost Sawallisch and two members of the original cast, and the Kabuki
actor-director Ennosuke Ichikawa was not present to restage it. The result
had the taste of a poorly reheated meal.
The visual language of Kabuki (designs by Setsu Asakura and Tomio Mohri)
produced some striking stage pictures in the naive fairy-tale world of the
Emperor: ceremonial costumes, gilded head-dresses and exotic back-cloths,
including an awesome Buddha-like image of the Emperor turning to stone. Most
eloquent of all was the pagoda-setting for the Empress's dream in Act 2,
haunted by a red-plumed human Falcon whose preening gestures would have done
credit to an oriental aviary. True to Kabuki style, the action had a ritual
mime-like quality, and there was some authentic stage magic.
But when it came to characterising the more mundane surroundings of Barak's
world - a mosaic of strip-curtains and the headscarf-and-smock costumes of
central Asian nomads - the Kabuki experiment began to founder. Now needing
to animate the stage according to the rules of European theatre, Ichikawa
had nothing to say. Barak and his entourage had about as much expressive
vitality as paper cut-outs, while the Empress scuttled around like an
outsize, out-of-place geisha. Unlike Jean-Pierre Ponnelle's Cologne
production of the late 1970s, which also took Kabuki as its reference point,
Ichikawa's Frau showed no synthesis of theatrical traditions. At best, it
taught Munich's opera-goers something about Kabuki; at worst, it was an
expensive gimmick, which failed to scratch the surface of this problematic
work.
The cast, dominated by Americans, was unable to make up the deficit - or
justify festival seat-prices. The Kabuki style gave Luana DeVol's Empress
little scope for personality, and she lacked the vocal radiance for the
part. Kenneth Garrison's Emperor, looking like a mobile museum dummy, had a
wretched time with Strauss's awkward tenor writing and was mercilessly
booed. Despite their hamstrung impersonation of Barak and his wife, Alan
Titus and Janis Martin sang well - particularly Miss Martin, who is in
better voice than ever. Reinhild Runkel missed the witch's venom which has
distinguished her Nurse on previous occasions. In the pit, Horst Stein
proved a reliable guide to Strauss's musical architecture and instrumental
delicacies - without matching the fluidity and sense of inexorable sweep
that lifted Sawallisch's performances.
The Shostakovich production, sung in German, at least had in Hildegard
Behrens a singer-actress capable of carrying the show alone. Katerina
Ismailova is a part to which Behrens's talents are perfectly matched: here
was the personification of human vulnerability and frustrated sexuality,
every note and gesture wedded to the heartfelt emotions being expressed.
But what a shapeless, mediocre staging] Too blunt for satire, too
superficial for tragedy, the action unfolded like a cheap catalogue of bonk
and bestiality, punctuated by moments of unintentioned comedy. The German
film director Volker Schlondorff made the fatal mistake of 'choreographing'
Shostakovich's brilliantly descriptive interludes, for some of which the
brass section of the orchestra trooped on stage like a village band -
undermining the already fragile technical control of the conductor, Peter
Schneider. There was no hint of the grotesque, no sense of the epic course
of destiny, no engagement with the work's radical film-like quality - nor
any compensating atmosphere in the grey geometric ramps and gauzes designed
by Viktor Volsky.
Kenneth Riegel proved that Sinovy need not be a wimp to be credible. Donald
McIntyre, with what voice that remains, captured the geriatric randiness of
the despotic Boris. Alfred Kuhn gave a delicious cameo as the degenerate
priest. Kurt Schreibmayer, a handsome blonde Sergey, demanded more of his
light tenor that it had to offer. In all, a limp, misdirected evening.

<TEXT>
Lehar's operetta was the last foray this season by the Glyndebourne Festival
to the South Bank. Like its earlier Beatrice et Benedict and Fidelio, The
Merry Widow last Sunday (two more to come, tonight and Thursday), had no
pretence at staging; and like the Berlioz, it has too much dialogue in
foreign-speak for a concert. The same hopeful solution was adopted: scrap
the speeches, and hire an amusing English narrator to sketch the action
between the musical numbers, which will be sung in the original language.
For Beatrice John Wells' narration was widely reported to be less amusing
than facetious, intrusive and interminable. The Widow had different
problems. The narrator's script, commissioned from Tom Stoppard, was built
upon the conceit that a marginal character should recount the action whilst
smugly imagining himself to be a central figure in it (cf. Stoppard's
Travesties). There were a few clever jokes, often about the absurdities of
the plot; Dirk Bogarde's arch delivery had its moments.
What the narration and the expensive programme-book failed to do, however,
was to tell the audience what most of the singing was about. Though each
number is founded neatly upon some metaphor - or a histrionic slogan, like
'I am a respectable wife]' - no clues were given us. The net effect was that
the verbal convolutions of Stoppard's narrator were interrupted from time to
time by tunes sung to obscure foreign words.
That said, I must say also that this Lustige Witwe boasted an appealing
international cast, and in Franz Welser-Most a conductor thoroughly attuned
to Lehar. He milked his muted strings for maximum sentiment, aptly, in the
'Vilja' song and elsewhere; the LPO rose to a creditable Schwung in every
waltz, and they and their conductor brought off their pressurised up-tempo
reprises with eclat. The Glyndebourne Chorus were crisp and lusty (some of
them stepped efficiently into minor roles too). Among the diplomatic
personnel, Robert Poulton's Baron Zeta bristled brightly.
As the widow Hanna, Felicity Lott visibly enjoyed the whole performance and
was coolly ravishing in 'Vilja'. There will be CDs for sure, and on them her
soft-grained soprano will carry over the ensembles; live in the Festival
Hall, however, she had not the diamond-cut edge to slice through. Her forte
is 'silvery', not vocally commandeering in the manner of a seasoned operetta
star.
The tenor John Aler was properly stylish and wimpish as lovelorn Camille.
His adulterous Valencienne, Elzbieta Szmytka, played the soubrette by the
classical rule-book, with too little scope to display the lively creative
gifts we admired in her recent Wigmore Hall recital. As Hanna's inamorato
Count Danilo, the ultra-tall, virile, expansively laid-back American
baritone Thomas Hampton might have seemed a raw cartoon; in fact he captured
the airs of a classy European spiv to the hilt, lacking only a husky
undertone of vulnerable feeling.
Without that, we felt no real stab of dismay when he decided to retreat to
the decadent swirl at Maxim's. Yet little stabs like that are what earn
halos for Lehar settings of silly stories: the plot-mechanics may creak, but
he finds occasions - just often enough - to match professionally crafted
tunes to honestly felt situations. In the verbose circumstances of this
Merry Widow, we could not be struck by that as much as we might have been.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
The Kirov brought Le Corsaire into the season's repertory on Monday night.
It is a preposterous, jolly staging. The corsair's vessel sails under the
flag of convenience of 'Petipa', but its real identity is Carry on
Slave-trading. The ballet's relationship to any historical antecedents is,
shall we say, tenuous. Many editorial hands have been at work on production
and score - what we see is nearer Indiana Jones than Byron. Amid piratical
goings-on, lovely girls, Pashas, and a squad of Turkish troops who have fed
too well on rahat loukoum, there are fascinating set pieces of choreography
that have survived from Petipa's recensions of this celebrated 19th-century
spectacular. They are surrounded by manic scenes that the Kirov artists play
tongue-in-cheek, treading with supreme skill a tight-rope between emotional
extravagance and farce. The staging, like its spatch-cocked score, makes no
sense other than as an excuse for the company to have fun and then grip us
with tremendous classic dancing. I don't think it is Le Corsaire - but I
don't know what else to call it, and I enjoy every minute.
Chief pleasure on Monday was Konstantin Zaklinsky as the slave-trader
Lankedem. Zaklinsky is a spiffing comedian. Under the handsome trappings of
the premier danseur there is a fortunately ill-hidden farceur. Whether
chaffering over slave prices in the first scene or persuading the heroine to
administer a Mickey Finn in a ludicrous bunch of flowers to the infinitely
boring hero, Zaklinsky is a joy. He knows exactly how too-far to go, and in
a cast more sober-sided than the piece deserves, he was a beacon of physical
wit and of the light-hearted manner that must keep the drama alive.
The hero, Conrad, is a thankless role, but not as thankless as Alexander
Kurkov showed us. His side-kick Ali - whose reward in life is the tricky
bits in the famous pas de deux, which turns out to be a pas de trois, with
Conrad as the mari complaisant - was Farukh Ruzimatov. His locks more
tangled than heretofore, and looking as if he were in search of a production
of Hiawatha, Ruzimatov struck serpentine poses and gave us self-parody
rather than performance. Yulia Makhalina was the heroine, Medora, very
brilliant in technical effects, the conquering virtuoso ever in search of
challenges. She provides dancing of aggressive virtuosity, and Medora's
character is lost in the steps. I found Irina Shapchits delightful in the
second ballerina role of Gulnara. Her dancing is so sweetly, featly done
that you warm to the sheer charm of her technical fluency and to the
character she establishes with such gentleness.
The key to the production is the Jardin Anime, a classical show-piece which
is well-preserved Petipa, and a beguiling reminder of his manner. Cohorts of
girls in pink group themselves, bearing garlands. Fountains play. Makhalina
and Shapchits nip through variations, each according to her temperament (and
the contrast between bravura and grace is in itself intriguing). The prelude
to the scene also offers soloist roles with more Petipa variations - in
which I admired Larissa Lezhnina and Irina Sitnikova. All of this epitomises
the evening: sparkling classic dance embedded in an exotic setting. And I
suspect that some of Petipa's work was ever like that. It is, on any terms,
worth seeing.
The Kirov Ballet continues at The Coliseum with mixed programmes until July

Having suffered periodic back pain for 20 years I shall watch Doc Martin's
Casebook (7.30 BBC1) with fascination and scepticism. Doctors stand in
relation to back pain as clergymen do to god: it is all faith and mumbo
jumbo. They know nothing for sure, work entirely in the dark, and success
(rare) is a matter of pure chance.
If we cannot have another British police series as good as Between The
Lines, and the Americans are producing nothing to compare with Kojak or Hill
Street Blues, I suppose third best - an Australian series - will just have
to do. Presumably the broadcasters feel that in Police Rescue they do at
least speak English, or a close approximation. In today's episode there is
derring-do on a skyscraper and a crane.
The last of Channel 4's tribute to the late Juris Podnieks, Camera Of
Courage, deals with events in Latvia and Armenia just prior to the collapse
of the Soviet Union (9.00). BBC2's season of repeats of The Wednesday Play
from the 1960s offers an early Dennis Potter: 'Where The Buffalo Roam',
starring Hywel Bennett as a retarded Welsh teenager (9.00).

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER DUNKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
So it is over. What are we to do now on Saturday nights? We have seen
Hermann walking back down that long country road - bringing to mind the old
Start-Rite ad, even though the trees were missing - towards his home
village. His three vows have all been broken. He said he would never return
to Schabbach. He said that after his family's cruel destruction of his
ecstatic boyhood affair with Klarchen he would never love another woman. And
he vowed that his only love would be music.
Now he has returned to Schabbach. He has admitted his love for Clarissa. And
although he has established himself as a composer and a relatively rich man
(perhaps from film scores and jingles, it is one of the practical details
which never became entirely clear) his future could lie anywhere. More to
the point, music is not his only love: people and places have exerted their
power over him and the ideals of the young man who set out so long ago, as
it now seems, have been re-forged on the anvil of life, in the heat of
experience.
For 13 weeks we have been watching that anvil and feeling the heat. The
Second Heimat: A New Generation was a sequel to Edgar Reitz's extraordinary
and hugely successful Heimat. The first series told the story of a whole
generation of Germans, from the first world war to the 1980s. Set in a
village in the Hunsruck, it had a feeling for its period, a sense of place,
and a cast of vividly realised characters which gave the serial much of the
power of a soap opera. Yet its ambitions went way beyond those of any soap:
its themes ranged from social history to technological development; from
ambivalent attitudes towards Nazism to the meaning of patriotism and
attachment to landscape. It was one of the most powerful and impressive
works ever shown on television.
That first series occupied around 16 hours. The second, with 13 episodes of
two hours each, lasts 26 hours and every minute of both series was -
astoundingly - written, directed and produced by Reitz. You might
conceivably conclude that the first work was some sort of anomaly. With the
second, which is in certain ways even better than the first, Reitz has
proved beyond question that he has a huge talent. Furthermore if it is not
unique, he has so far proved uniquely capable of getting the backing to put
his work on the screen for these remarkable periods of time, enabling him to
use drama to explore modern life in a way that has scarcely been attempted
by anyone else.
The only British television dramatist who has tried anything vaguely similar
is Frederic Raphael (The Glittering Prizes, After The War) and even
Raphael's keenest fans could not pretend that his series had the same scope.
Reitz's breadth of vision is Tolstoyan, and future generations will surely
look to Heimat 1 &amp; 2 as a key work of the late 20th century.
We are told that 'heimat' means much more than homeland: Reitz has said it
is 'the distant and yet familiar world in which memories and their images in
the mind's eye are one'. As the 13 episodes of The Second Heimat: A New
Generation have flowed past, the importance of both parts of that unwieldy
title have become increasingly apparent. This new series has been deeply
concerned with the new Germany: the country where large businessmen drive
large Mercedes, and bourgeois flat hunters queue dutifully for a rare though
expensive vacant flat in Munich (illustrated with one of Reitz's typically
striking images: an endless helix of clients, turning and turning up a
staircase).
That is the new homeland. But the series has been even more concerned with
the 'new generation': the young Germans whose parents were either Nazis ('My
father was a pilot; helped bomb Guernica; got a medal for it; wore it next
to his heart . . .') or, nearly as bad in the eyes of the new generation,
failed to prevent Nazism. Given that this appalling double bind is not
something that British viewers have had to live with, it is amazing how
universal has been the appeal of the series.
It began in 1960 with Hermann Simon, played with overwhelming charm by Henry
Arnold, arriving from the country to study music at the academy in Munich.
It ended in 1970 with Hermann pursuing Clarissa across Europe, to spend the
night, finally, in her arms - not, characteristically for these two, in bed,
but on the floor of a small Amsterdam hotel. There was a dreadful moment
when it seemed that Reitz was about to have them gaze into one another's
eyes, swear undying love, and wander hand in hand into the sunset across
some canal bridge.
Having been so compellingly truthful for 25 hours about the ambivalence of
modern sexual relations in general and those of Hermann and Clarissa in
particular; having brought the character of Clarissa, played with such power
and poignancy by Salome Kammer, through marriage to her cello (Reitz cast a
genuine cellist in the role which paid tremendous dividends, then, by all
accounts, fell in love with her and now lives with her) to partnership with
Volker and a child, and finally abandonment of the cello in favour of
passionate adherence to feminism - after all that it would have been
appallingly cowardly to opt for a Barbara Cartland finale. But of course
Reitz did not.
Such sentimentality would have been wholly uncharacteristic. Although Reitz
has always conveyed his story by way of a personal odyssey (13 actually
since each episode has concentrated on a different character, though
Hermann, Clarissa, Juan, Schnusschen and so on have remained central) part
of his purpose has been to chart the change in moral attitudes during our
lives and in this he has been impressively, sometimes chillingly, honest.
From the early sixties and the tendency of students to quote Spinoza while
playing the Beatles, via the era of sex, drugs and rock and roll, to 'les
evenements' when everyone had to debate the ideology of every action, then
to the violence typified by the Baader Meinhof gang, Reitz has catalogued
the mores of the decade.
In contrast to the embarrassment with such matters on British television, he
has been particularly successful at dealing with sex. During the episode
when Hermann played Chopin while one girl rubbed ointment into the
police-inflicted wound on his back, another fed him whipped cream off her
finger, and a third merely gazed up at him in adoration, sexuality hung in
the air like incense in a cathedral. Yet there was not a thing that
Sexfinder General Lord Rees-Mogg could have put his finger on. In another
episode where Hermann and Schnusschen made love while baby-sitting the
sexual atmosphere was jokey, delightful and matter-of-fact in a way that is
impossible to imagine in a British television drama. It really was, in that
over used phrase, true to life, as was so much of this huge work.
Yet The Second Heimat was no documentary. The reason why Saturday nights
will seem so empty now is that, like every great creator of fiction, Reitz
created a wholly convincing world that we could opt into. For 13 weeks we
have lived with Hermann and Rob, Helga and Stefan, the tragic Reinhard, and
even little Lulu, Hermann's daughter who ended up with a definite character
of her own. Reitz's genius is not that he has recreated so accurately some
of the key social and ethical landmarks of our lives, but that he has done
so as the background to a gripping story about people who have sometimes
seemed more real than our own friends.
Whenever Reitz wants to take Hermann and Clarissa, Elisabeth and Trixi on
into the 1970s it cannot be too soon.

FT  21 JUL 93 / Business and the Environment: And polluted flows the Po -
Agricultural waste has taken its toll of Italy's main waterway
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This is the time of year when thousands of tourists descend on Italy's
Adriatic coast, one of Europe's holiday magnets, and hotels from the Venice
Lido to Rimini start raising prices and dusting off 'full up' signs.
Few on the packed beaches will be bothered much about the state of the
Adriatic. The disastrous summer of 1989, when an invasion of algae blackened
beaches and left hoteliers facing ruin, has been long forgotten.
But although less conspicuous than in the past, water pollution remains the
Adriatic's Achilles heel. Italian scientists do not know where the algae
came from and why they grew so alarmingly. Pending an explanation, local
tourist bosses will continue watching the waters carefully for signs of a
revival.
Most observers agree one of the keys to the problem is the River Po, Italy's
main waterway and one of Europe's prime arteries. Terminating in a broad and
beautiful delta just south of Venice, it passes through Piedmont, Lombardy
and the Veneto - three of the country's biggest, most industrial and most
heavily farmed regions - before reaching the sea. About 37 per cent of
Italian industry is in the Po basin, while the resident population is nearly
16m - more than a quarter of the total.
In the past three decades, the Po has become synonymous with pollution. Big
riverside cities, such as Turin or those nearby, like Milan, have used it as
their dustbin. Urban sewage, though treated, has not always been up to
standard. At smaller towns and villages along the river, enforcement has
sometimes lapsed.
Many big businesses also depend on the Po as a free resource or a drain.
Cooling water from riverside power stations drives up river temperatures,
harming what marine life is left. Environmentalists warn that dumping rules
are far from foolproof, while industry adds a potent cocktail of phenol,
solvents and toxic metals.
But the biggest pollutant is agriculture, according to Roberto Passino, the
man in charge of the authority for the Po basin, the main watchdog over
water quality and the riverside environment.
The Po valley is Italy's biggest stretch of flat land, making it ideal
farmland in a largely mountainous country. Agricultural traditions stretch
back for centuries; the ricefields around Pavia have even influenced
northern Italy's cuisine, with risotto as popular as pasta.
Rice growing is one of the worst offenders, Passino says. The pressure to
compete against cheaper Asian producers means farmers use pesticides heavily
to control crop damage and improve yields.
Pesticides, weedkillers and fertilisers pervade north Italian agriculture.
Farmers have started cutting back to save money, but much damage has already
been done, he says. The worst has come through chemical seepage into the
water table, affecting local drinking water. About 70 per cent of drinking
water in the Po valley comes from underground reserves.
Chemicals have also found their way into the Po, damaging water quality
along the river and eventually the Adriatic.
However, it is livestock, not farming, which represents the greatest threat,
warns Passino. The surge in pig farming in the past 30 years has triggered a
vicious circle of pollution. While the size of herds has soared, the space
available has remained virtually constant. 'The quantity of waste produced
is immense,' he says. Though some can be used as natural fertiliser, that is
only a fraction of the total. Chemical treatment - the main alternative -
has been limited so far and is not always adequate. Transportation, another
option, is expensive and potentially hazardous because of accidents.
Breeding pigs is part of local culture, particularly around Parma. But the
industry has grown exponentially through its own growth and the rise in
diary farming.
Reggio Emilia, next door to Parma, is synonymous for Italians with Parmesan
cheese. As dairying expanded, farmers looked for profitable sidelines for
waste dairy products. Pigs provided the answer.
No one is talking about closing down pig breeders or doing away with
Parmesan, Passino stresses. But other countries with heavy concentrations of
livestock farming, such as the Netherlands and Denmark, have pursued much
more interventionist policies to ensure breeding is distributed more evenly
around a region.
In spite of the challenges facing the Po, Passino tries to remain
optimistic. 'It's not true that it's a grossly polluted river - though there
are sections which are especially bad. The Rhine is much worse. What I say
is that it could be much better than it is.'
Creating the authority was a big step forward. 'For the first time, we are
putting people round a table and getting them to work together. Our main
function is to prepare a plan for the Po and then supervise its
implementation', he says. 'First, we need to think about how feasible
various steps might be, then start talking about implementing them.'
One strategy will be to persuade farmers to use chemicals more sparingly.
Passino has four immediate suggestions to change agricultural attitudes:
Greater price controls over pesticides and weedkillers to deter excessive
use.
Better weather information for farmers, so that repetitive use of chemicals
 -necessary after an unforeseen rainstorm - can be minimised.
Enforcing charges for the use of water, which is now virtually free, to
limit the use of chemicals.
Moving away from single-crop farming, which weakens the soil and requires
greater use of chemical fertilisers to raise yields.
And the Adriatic? Passino, one of Italy's leading experts on water quality,
says it has always suffered from pollution. 'Pollution in the Po is
certainly a contributor. But it's not the only one, and it's not the single
most important factor.'
In time, he hopes the river authority's efforts to monitor and co-ordinate
regional policies will improve the water quality. But he has no illusions
about how long it will take.
'It took 25 years to achieve the first results cleaning up the Thames.'

FT  21 JUL 93 / Business and the Environment: A clearer path through the
numerical maze - Designers need a simple method of assessing green criteria
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH ALDERSEY-WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
European companies tend to put the cart before the horse when it comes to
making their activities environmentally cleaner. Only a small part of their
efforts goes towards ensuring that their products are designed from the
start to meet 'green' criteria, as well as be attractive and useful.
Yet designers can make a positive contribution to environmental improvement.
Despite accusations that its members tend to encourage consumption and
built-in obsolescence, the design profession appears keen to help create
greener products.
Designers are well positioned to advance the cause of environmentally
responsible industry, since they appreciate consumers' moods and have the
ear of manufacturers.
Their problem has been the tidal wave of data on the environmental impact of
the many materials that designers use - 200 types of plastic alone.
Designers are poor at making sense of all this. 'Industrial designers are
not trained to interpret information that is presented in a scientific way,'
according to Paul Burall, author of Green Design.
Yet these data are vital for life-cycle analysis (LCA), emerging as the
common practice for assessing the environmental impact of manufacturing
options.
Current waste management practices do not generally consider the
manufactured product itself as part of that waste. This anomaly shows up in
LCA. There is a growing belief that manufacturers should take responsibility
for their products' environmental impact after sale. Germany, for example,
plans legislation that will force manufacturers of electronic consumer goods
to take back their products and ensure recycling.
One difficulty is to insulate often innumerate designers from the tedious
arithmetic of LCA for each material they may want to use. Just as designers
seldom do the stress calculations that ensure their product will not fall
apart, so they should not be personally responsible for the green
calculations, according to Phil Seeney of the PA Consulting Group. For
complex projects, the answer may lie in product development teamwork in
which an LCA expert joins forces with engineers and designers.
Meanwhile, the emphasis is on giving designers a foolproof ready reckoner
for routine use. One programme aimed at developing a common LCA methodology
called Milion has been developed by the Eindhoven-based European Design
Centre and funded by the Dutch National Reuse of Waste Research Programme.
In a pilot project, six companies volunteered to design or redesign a
product according to Milion's criteria.
The results show that 'environmentally elegant' products that use fewer
materials and energy are possible for the same or lower production costs, a
finding of interest to industries that too readily dismisses greening as an
additional expense.
In Sweden, companies, including ABB, Electrolux and Tetrapak, are
participating in a national programme for ecological product development.
The key to their system's workability lies in the calculation of an
'environmental load value' for each material or manufacturing process
choice. This value is calculated as the product of an 'environmental index'
and the quantity of material or energy.
Each environmental index is calculated from a detailed LCA. Designers can
thus use a simple constant and do not become embroiled in the theory and
mathematics of the LCA itself. The technique can be used to compare the
relative merits of steel or aluminium car body parts, for example. It takes
into account the energy needed to extract the two materials as well as the
quantity of material required to form the component, and the energy
consumption of the car in use in both cases.
Philips, the Dutch electronics concern, has established an even simpler
points system for the various materials and processes its design department
might use. Each material has its figure of merit; there is another figure
for the degree to which that material is from recycled sources; others for
additives, glues and finishes; and still others for various manufacturing
processes. The designer simply tots up the relevant figures.
Results are approximate but still useful, for example enabling comparison of
environmental criteria between different countries where Philips has the
option of manufacturing a product. It is important that the data be
quantitative but also simple, says Philip White, in charge of environmental
design research at Philips Corporate Industrial Design Centre. 'Limited use
of numbers is fine with designers. But with engineers anything that doesn't
use numbers is suspect.'

that suggest it is sticking to a status quo approach rather than making an
attempt to change the make-up of the board or the role of the governors.
In the role of vice-chairman, it has swapped one former Labour Treasury
minister with another.
Lord Cocks of Hartcliffe, a former parliamentary secretary to the Treasury
and former government chief whip, takes over from Lord Barnett, former chief
secretary to the Treasury, whose term of office at the BBC runs out at the
end of this month.
Bill Jordan, president of the Amalgamated Engineering and Electrical Union
has been re-appointed for a second five year term as a BBC governor and
Margaret Spurr, headmistress of Bolton School, girls' division also becomes
a governor.
The retiring governors are John Roberts of Merton College, Oxford, whose
term expired in March, Baroness James, the novelist and Keith Oates,
managing director of Marks and Spencer, whose terms run out at the end of
this month.
Two further governors have to be appointed to bring the board up to full
strength.
Lord Cocks, MP for Bristol South from 1970-1987, will receive an annual
salary of Pounds 14,715 for the part-time job. The other governors get
Pounds 7,360.

CITIBANK has appointed Nigel Kempner and Stephen Musgrave to run London
Capital Holdings, a newly formed property subsidiary.
London Capital Holdings was formed when Citibank took over the assets of
Rands-worth Trust, after the receivership of Randsworth's parent company.
The deal, which was an unusual example of a bank taking control of a UK
property company, had its origins in the 1989 Pounds 258m acquisition of
Randsworth by JMB Realty, a US investment group, which was financed by
Citibank. The collapse in the UK property market resulted in a large book
loss for Citibank.
Kempner and Musgrave, who were directors of Rands-worth between 1987 and
1993, have been appointed joint managing directors. Tony Brooks, finance
director of Citibank International, has been appointed to the board, as have
Stephen Karper and James Maguire, both directors of Citibank's UK Real
Estate Department.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
June de Moller was reading for the bar and had every intention of becoming a
barrister - until she became completely fascinated by commerce. After
various jobs in the printing industry more than 20 years ago, she joined a
small printing company called Tangent Industries which was run by two
brothers - Michael and David Green.
Yesterday June de Moller became managing director of the company that grew
out of Tangent - Carlton Communications, the media group now capitalised at
Pounds 1.46bn. She replaces Keith Edelman who was headhunted to replace
David Dworkin as chief executive of Storehouse, the retail group.
De Moller has run individual divisions of Carlton, where she has been a
director since 1983, but for the past two years has been in charge of
corporate strategy and business development. 'I think that extra experience
in strategy from a more global view made the difference,' says de Moller. At
46 she is a non-executive director of Anglian Water and on the board of the
Riverside Mental Health Trust.
At the same time as promoting de Moller, the Carlton board has reorganised
directors' responsibilities.
Thomas Epley, chief executive of Technicolor, Carlton's video cassette and
film duplication subsidiary, joins the board with responsibility for group
video and film services.
Nigel Walmsley, chief executive of Carlton Television, the ITV company which
holds the London weekday licence, will now be responsible for all
broadcasting and software businesses including Pickwick, the video producer
and distributor.
Both will report to de Moller, who never did become a barrister. She will
have direct responsibility for Carlton's television equipment businesses.
Bernard Cragg, Carlton's finance director, will take on the extra
responsibility of strategy.

FT  21 JUL 93 / Management: A guarantee of satisfaction - Case study: ISS
Belgium sees levels of new business grow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The marketing potential of a quality assurance standard is well illustrated
by the experience of ISS Belgium - that country's second largest contract
cleaning company and part of the international, publicly quoted ISS group,
writes Tim Dickson.
Obtaining ISO9000 last May was one stage in a much wider quality programme
which ISS Belgium's managing director Theo Dilissen claims has transformed
customer perceptions and made an impact on his bottom line.
It quickly became clear to Dilissen when he was appointed in July 1989 that
the best way to increase turnover was to reverse the old acquisition
strategy and concentrate on organic growth. 'Contract cleaning is
essentially a commodity business and buyers are largely interested in
price,' he explains. 'We wanted to promote a service-based culture which
would distinguish us from our competitors.'
Market research demonstrated the real problem was the poor image of the
contract cleaning industry as a whole. 'There was a general feeling of
scepticism about the services offered by us and our competitors.'
Training for first line managers and cleaning staff is a key element of the
ISS approach, but Dilissen was convinced right from the start that ISO9000
certification would represent a customer guarantee. 'It does not guarantee
good performance in itself,' he says. 'What it does is imply that the
quality standards you have agreed with your customer will be kept. It's an
assurance particularly during the upheaval which happens when a customer is
changing his contractor.'
A survey of 500 professional buyers by ISS Belgium earlier this year
demonstrated that the company's name awareness had risen to 44 per cent from
5 per cent in 1989. Its link with the ISO certification was recognised by 83
per cent of respondents and 65 per cent said the quality standard was 'a
significant advantage'.
Even more important, the levels of new business gained each year leaped
dramatically, from BFr25m-BFr35m a year before 1989 to a projected BFr230m
(Pounds 4.3m) in 1993. Operating profits rose 70 per cent in 1992 and are
expected to increase a further 29 per cent this year. ISS Belgium has total
turnover of BFr1.6bn and 2,200 employees.
The Belgian example is seen as a model within ISS Europe, whose chief
executive Waldemar Schmidt believes ISO9000 'communicates professionalism'.
He says that in the UK 'we can't use it as a marketing tool because everyone
else has it', but implies that the company can steal a march on competitors
elsewhere in Europe.

FT  21 JUL 93 / Management: A victim of its own success - Controversy over a
BSI standard threatens to discredit the issue of quality
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
David Franklin had been supplying one large supermarket with air fresheners
for 14 years. Suddenly, he was given three months' notice that unless his
south London company registered for BS5750, a quality management standard,
it would be dropped from the supplier list.
'It would have cost us Pounds 4,000 to obtain BS5750,' says Franklin,
managing director of the company which bears his name. For a business with
turnover of Pounds 750,000 and a workforce of only seven, he says, the
quality standard would have been an unnecessary burden.
Fortunately, Franklin was able to convince the supermarket buyer that the
standard would not mean a better product but would push up his costs. The
buyer backed off but Franklin knows other businessmen who have not been so
lucky.
Companies around the country have been coming under pressure from their
customers to conform to BS5750, frequently after many years of trouble-free
dealings.
BS5750 was launched in the late 1970s to improve the poor quality image of
British industry and was taken up in Europe as EN29000 and around the world
as an international standard ISO9000. But it now threatens to damage the
reputation of the British Standards Institution (BSI), which created it, and
more importantly, discredit the issue of quality across a large sector of
British business.
The furore over BS5750 has forced BSI to set up a special committee to
review the problems caused to smaller companies. It is looking at ways of
simplifying the implementation of the standard for small firms and reducing
costs.
So concerned has BSI become at the growing controversy that last week it
made the first of a planned series of presentations to the press to explain
the standard and the role of BSI.
'I want to clear the air because there are a lot of misconceptions about BSI
and its terms of reference,' said Viv Thomas, BSI chairman. 'BS5750 is a
national asset which BSI designed and exported around the world.'
Setting quality standards for your suppliers is nothing new. The Ministry of
Defence and the nationalised industries have long had codes and guidelines
to ensure they got value for their large purchasing budgets. BS5750 was
launched in 1979 to establish some common standards and to extend the idea
more widely throughout industry.
Ironically, BS5750 has become a victim of its own success. Initially it was
taken up by large companies which could cope with the formal systems
involved and the large volumes of paperwork but it has since spread to
smaller firms. It has been enthusiastically adopted by organisations as
diverse as manufacturers, accountants, chambers of commerce, schools and
police stations.
The controversy surrounding BS5750 has caught BSI unprepared. It is used to
writing industry-specific product standards - covering the durability of
fitted kitchens and the strength of motor cycle helmets. BS5750 was the
first of what are known as 'horizontal' standards, applicable across a broad
swathe of industry.
It has come at a particularly difficult time for BSI. The organisation is
half-way through a programme to make it less bureaucratic and more
commercially minded. The strains created by this process led to the surprise
resignation of its chief executive, Michael Sanderson, last month.
It has also coincided with a government review of BSI, the desirability of
continuing to subsidise the organisation and the issue of standards writing
in the UK.
Unlike the product standards which BSI routinely produces in their
thousands, BS5750 is a measure of quality procedures and much more open to
individual interpretation. It measures the consistency of a business's
systems for dealing with customer orders, purchasing, stock control,
manufacturing (or providing a service) and delivery.
BS5750 is intended as a readily recognised guarantee of a company's quality
assurance standards so that customers do not have to carry out their own
assessment and suppliers avoid being swamped by inspection visits. But one
critic, Trevor McCarthy, who has worked with companies registering for
BS5750, says companies should write their own, brief, quality manuals and
use inspection visits as a way of impressing potential customers.
BSI and many of the 22,000 UK businesses which have registered for the
standard refute the criticisms of BS5750. It allows companies to reduce
waste, increase productivity and obtain a competitive advantage, says
Thomas.
One engineering company with turnover of Pounds 1m and a workforce of 35
saved thousands of pounds and achieved a big improvement in customer
relations when it tightened up its procedures for maintaining and updating
its engineering drawings. Before obtaining BS5750 and taking greater care
with its drawings it would turn out parts to an obsolete specification and
have to scrap the consignment.
Arranging for the proper storage of tools saved employees of the same
company lost time previously spent hunting in corners and under benches for
a mislaid piece of tooling.
'We have had a positive feedback from 20 companies for every company with a
negative experience,' comments Thomas. A survey of more than 2,300 companies
which had qualified for BS5750 by Pera International, a research and
consultancy group, showed that 89 per cent reported improvements to
operational efficiency, 76 per cent obtained a marketing benefit and 48 per
cent an improvement in profitability.
But other surveys have revealed a more critical view of BS5750. Only 8 per
cent of managers rated their quality initiatives a total success - due to a
shortage of resources and a lack of commitment by top management - according
to an Institute of Management study. A survey by IBM Consulting Group to
determine whether British companies were up to 'world class' standards
showed that possession of BS5750 made no difference unless it was part of a
wider quality programme.
Concern about BS5750 has arisen for several reasons:
It is frequently mistaken for a guarantee of product or service quality.
Companies which took up the standard in the early 1980s understood the
distinction but this has been lost as its use has become more widespread.
'With hindsight we should have kept up the awareness campaign,' comments
Derek Prior, BSI's communications manager. BS5750 has even started to appear
on consumer product labelling, with the implicit suggestion that it is a
quality mark.
It sets no formal, standard criteria because quality management systems are
infinitely variable depending on the company, its activity and procedures.
When Toshiba's copier division launched a programme to persuade its UK
dealers to register for BS5750 it debated whether to set a response time for
repair men of eight or 16 hours. Eventually it decided on eight hours. But
it could have set 16 hours providing it consistently met this standard.
Toshiba has backed up BS5750 with a range of its own, defined quality
procedures.
It generates paperwork. Small companies in particular use simple procedures
which are frequently not written down. Formalising these systems can produce
thick quality manuals. When Wessex Water registered for BS5750 the
documentation of its quality systems filled 164 manuals - a total of more
than 22,000 pages. 'But it is not all new paper,' says John Snoxell, water
production and systems manager. 'Most should have existed before. Now it is
all under control and we know where all the copies are.'
It is costly, particularly at the end of a recession, when companies'
resources have been depleted. Consultants' fees could amount to Pounds
400-Pounds 500 a day for between 15 and 20 days, a total of Pounds
6,000-Pounds 10,000, though government subsidies could meet half or even
two-thirds of the bill. Costs could be cut further by taking part in joint
programmes run by trade associations and some consultants.
The cost of the initial assessment and monitoring over the first three years
for a professional services company employing 50 people on one site could
vary from Pounds 2,900 to Pounds 7,125, according to a recent handbook,
Implementing Quality through BS5750/ISO9000 (By P. Jackson and D. Jackson.
Kogan Page. Pounds 25).
There is often no indication whether a company has obtained BS5750 for the
entire range of its activities or for a small division employing only a few
people. Companies are not obliged to be precise, although they would be
legally liable if they attached it to an operation which had not qualified.
The system for approving certification companies is in need of overhaul.
Twenty six certification companies have been accredited by the National
Accreditation Council for Certification Bodies, but other non-accredited
organisations may also award certificates.
BS5750 has not yet made great inroads internationally. Many countries with a
good record for product quality, which BS5750's critics say is all that
really matters to the customer, make little use of the standard. BSI's
Quality Assurance division, one of the 26 accredited groups, has issued
BS5750/ISO9000 certificates to 14,805 UK companies but to only 367 in the
US, 122 in Japan and 45 in Germany. Overseas interest is increasing however,
BSI says.
It is important that the controversy about BS5750 is resolved. For BSI
because it has other 'horizontal' standards in the pipeline, covering the
fields of environmental management and total quality management. And for
business because, in the longer term, the move towards more formal quality
systems appears inevitable. Increasing cross-border trade will boost demand
for standards which are acceptable around the world.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Quality is popularly linked with the idea of excellence or achieving the
best. It is often associated with expense and luxury.
This traditional definition of quality has been joined by one of practical
relevance to business. As a goal for managers it consists of meeting the
customer's requirements or making a product which is fit for its purpose in
the most cost-effective way.
A medium-priced watch may lack the Swiss hand-crafting which goes with a
leading model. But it must keep accurate time and retain an attractive
appearance.
BS5750/ISO9000 takes the idea of quality and extends it to the systems by
which a company is managed. It assumes that the customer does not just want
a watch to suit his purse. He wants his inquiry dealt with rapidly and his
order processed as quickly as possible. The company wants its employees,
materials and tools to be in the right place at the right time to reduce
costs.
If something goes wrong the customer wants his complaint dealt with speedily
and the company wants to trace the problem and prevent it recurring. By
building quality assurance into a company's entire process, the need for
quality control at the end of the production line  - when rectifying
mistakes is most costly and least effective - is reduced.
Before looking at the requirements of the standard, businesses must confront
the sometimes confusing numbering system of its different parts. The core is
BS5750 part one (which corresponds to ISO9001) which applies to businesses
that design and develop their own products, as well as making, installing
and servicing them.
Part two (ISO9002) is applicable to businesses which do not carry out their
own design work but which make to a customer's requirements or to a
published specification. Part three applies to businesses where final
inspection and testing of the product or service are enough to assure
quality. There is also an unnumbered part known as the 'registered stockists
scheme.'
The standard includes sections dealing with:
Management Responsibility, which describes how a company should draw up an
organisation chart to show the responsibilities of all staff who manage or
carry out work associated with the quality of service. It requires quality
procedures to be documented.
Contract Review, which defines and documents the customer's requirements and
establishes that the resources needed to meet them are available.
Process Control, which requires the documentation of how the process is to
be carried out. Written instructions must be given to the employee involved
where appropriate and the process must be monitored.
Document Control, is the most common cause of companies failing to achieve
certification at their first attempt. It requires quality and procedure
manuals to be kept in designated locations. Unauthor-ised copies must not be
circulated and changes to the system and manuals must be logged.
Companies which obtain their certificate can display the logo of the
certification organisation. If the certifier has been accredited the logo
will be accompanied by the 'tick' of the National Accreditation Council for
Certification Bodies.

FT  21 JUL 93 / Management: Mixed benefits of registration - Case study:
Musthave postpones plans for certification
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Musthave (UK), a small haulage and warehousing company was well on the way
to registering for BS5750 when business started to turn down.
Having spent 'a couple of thousand pounds' on consultancy fees and two
months of his time preparing the documentation, Stuart Baldock, the owner
and managing director, was reluctant to scrap the project. He decided to
shelve his plans for registration but to maintain the systems he had set up
until demand improves. In the meantime, he says, he follows procedures which
are equivalent to BS5750 even though he does not have the certification
logo.
'When demand dropped off we thought 'What is the point of tying up a couple
of thousand pounds when the money could be employed elsewhere?' We run all
our procedures so that the certification body could come in. We will
definitely go for certification when things turn up.'
With turnover of Pounds 380,000 and a workforce of 20, the St Neots,
Cambridgeshire company is typical of smaller businesses which have had to
weigh up very carefully the costs and the benefits of registration.
Baldock does not believe that conforming to BS5750 procedures has yet saved
him any money. 'I run the business so I can watch every penny. I sign all
the cheques and can make sure that the customer gets what he wants 99.9 per
cent of the time,' he says.
What the quality standard does do is 'minimise the potential for cock-ups.'
It defines everyone's job and imposes a procedure for handling customers
from the moment the telephone rings through to processing the orders,
Baldock explains.
Even so Baldock believes BS5750 is probably more relevant in the larger
company, where departments do not communicate so easily with each other.
Introducing BS5750-style procedures is not the end of the matter. It
requires the company's quality representative, in Musthave's case it is
Baldock himself, to keep a close eye on the way the system is running.
'Someone has to be on top of it all the time,' he says. If people on the
shop floor discover a better way of doing things then the system can be
changed. But sometimes people are reluctant to report changes. The quality
representative has to make sure that shopfloor practice is not out of line
with the procedures which are recorded in the quality manual or modify the
manual.
Despite the commitment Baldock has made to BS5750 he is ambivalent about its
benefits for the smaller, owner-managed business. 'When business dropped off
we decided to concentrate on saving money,' he says. 'In our business you
can't put your rates up to cover the extra costs involved.'

FT  21 JUL 93 / Recruitment: The Doubleday family's damaging effect -
Backroom research by Japanese economist casts light on real problems of
employment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL DIXON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SO soon after Japan's royal wedding, it's perhaps un-seemly to liken
Tsugunori Hara to the boy who proclaimed that the emperor was wearing no
clothes. There is nevertheless a strong case for doing so, the reasons being
twofold.
The first is that Tokyo, where Mr Hara works as an economist at the
Sumitomo-Life Research Institute, was also the site of the announcement of
the forthcoming international conference on how to create jobs in
industrialised countries. The other is that, on past performance, the
political eminences doing the conferring will overlook the point the Tokyo
economist has apparently made.
I say 'apparently' because the only information to hand on his feat is a
two-sentence snippet based on a news agency report which can no longer be
traced. It says Mr Hara has proclaimed that Japan's real unemployment rate,
far from being the 2.5 per cent officially recorded, is 6 per cent.
He has arrived at the higher figure by taking account, not just of citizens
who are unwillingly jobless, but also of what he terms 'in-house
unemployment' - the numerous people who, although occupying paid positions,
have little if any actual work to do.
Having no more data, we alas can't check his way of estimating how many such
people there are. All I can say is that if they really amount to only 3.5
per cent of those available for employment, Japan has cause to be proud.
But our lack of knowledge of his methods does not detract from the
importance of the point he has made: that employment, as gauged by numbers
in jobs, is not the same as productive work. Nor is the distinction any less
important for the fact that it could hamper the international political
leaders soon to confer.
For, if they just ignored the difference as usual, their task in creating
jobs would be a doddle. Indeed they might well go far towards it simply by
acting in precisely the reverse way to the government of Singapore which,
fearing an over-supply of lawyers, is taking steps to cull them.
In explaining the policy, the minister responsible talked fore-bodingly of a
time soon coming when there would not be enough work for the country's
lawyers to do. With all due respect, however, the odds are that Judgment Day
will be over and done with before the time he spoke of arrives.
The reason is that lawyers fall into the category of employees who not only
create work for one another, but also undo the work that the others have
done. Hence the more of them there are, the busier they will become.
The only trouble of course is that, far from being productive, the net
effect could conceivably be harmful - as witness a hypothetical couple the
Jobs column has nightmares about, called Michael and Margaret Doubleday.
Since he is a senior inspector of taxes and she a tax-avoidance accountant,
they have more self-cancelling work to do than time to enjoy their resulting
opulence. Moreover, as professional ethics require them to work well apart,
they rarely meet. But they did get together for long enough 16 years ago to
have a son nicknamed Buster who, agonised by his parents' remoteness,
expresses his disaffection by vandalising public property. Hey presto: a
family producing net harm.
In fact, the only point of their existence is to show that society would
have been better off if either Michael or Margaret - and it doesn't matter
which one - had given up employment to ensure that Buster received the love
as well as the discipline essential to a civilised up-bringing.
Accordingly I present the Doubledays along with Mr Hara's calculation to the
politicians booked in for the conference. Perhaps the gift will remind them
that the best way ahead may lie, not in creating more employment of the
purely self-nourishing sort, but in engineering a reduced demand for it by
social-security and legal measures to encourage a strengthening instead of
further fragmenting of family life.
NOW to the table alongside, showing developments in the United Kingdom's
executive employment market as gauged by the MSL consultancy's quarterly
counts of jobs for managers and senior specialists advertised in UK national
journals. The upper part of the table focuses on the year to June 30,
starting with the separate 12-month tallies for eight broad categories of
work. Then comes the overall total, with the individual quarterly counts
beneath.
As may be seen from the April-June tally at the bottom, while the plunge in
advertised demand is not yet over, it is closer to being so than it has been
for almost four years, being only 0.4 per cent down on April-June 1991-92.
But before anyone breaks into wild rejoicing, it must be noted that six of
the work categories still show falls from the levels of 12 months before.
By that yardstick, the only two with increases are sales-and- marketing and
computing, both of which have been on a rising path for nine months without
transferring any of their upward energy to any other field. True, the
accounting category shows signs of being about to join them - although
whether that's good or bad news is another question.

FT  21 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Government proposals in latest
'assualt' on red tape
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Among proposals in the government's latest 'assault' on red tape are:
Enforcement agencies
Establish a code of conduct for enforcement agencies, requiring each of them
to publish their own codes for promoting openness, courtesy, helpfulness,
dealing with complaints and the giving of value for money.
Oil and gas
Streamline approval procedures for oil and gas field development consents.
Small businesses
Relax the statutory requirement for audit on 'certain small companies'.
Introduce a new 'small business litmus test' to be satisfied before new
regulations are imposed.
Health
Examine statutory sick pay regulations to simplify administration of the
scheme and reduce 'unnecessary' burdens on business.
Consumers
Simplify consumer credit legislation.
Transport
Reform regulation of taxis and minicabs.
Change the operator licensing regime for heavy goods vehicles and buses.
Local controls
'Streamline' water pollution and air emission controls.
Some proposals have already been announced by departments. None are
detailed, and many are only 'possibilities' pending further review.

FT  21 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: The end of ideas - Political
Notebook
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NO ONE speaks any longer of the end of history. The book of that name,
produced a few years ago as the Berlin Wall came down, has proved one of the
passing, if lucrative, fads so beloved of US academics.
But as Mr John Major's government stumbles towards the summer parliamentary
recess, its simplistic logic lives on in the British cabinet.
Unable to craft a credible agenda for the 1990s to replace the heroic
illusions of Mrs Margaret Thatcher's 1980s, Mr Major's colleagues are
invoking as their excuse the demise of the socialist demon.
The case was made a few days ago by Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary.
Now Mr Hurd is the most eloquent and elegant of ministers. He is among the
small group of senior Tories who can claim still to be political thinkers.
But in a speech in Oxfordshire last Friday he too began to bemoan the
passing of old enemies. The Soviet Union was gone, CND had evaporated, union
bosses had lost their power. How difficult it was, he complained, 'to work
yourself up into a storm of indignation against opponents who are empty of
ideas and character'.
It is a familiar refrain. Ask any cabinet minister these days to explain the
government's lack of direction and as likely as not they return
nostalgically to the great battles of the 1980s. Mr Major himself took up
the theme in a recent private meeting with parliamentary private
secretaries.
Mrs Thatcher had it easy, they say. Alongside the familiar demons mentioned
by Mr Hurd, there were a host of other enemies to slay.
There were nationalised industries, the Marxist mobsters running Liverpool
and London, runaway public spending, ludicrously high marginal tax rates. In
between times she could take aim at president Galtieri or at Mr Neil
Kinnock's leftwing past.
The Iron Lady then defined herself in terms of her enemies. Mr Major's
government cannot. In the process the Conservative party has lost the cement
which bound together its different factions through the 1980s. It is hardly
surprising that the government is having a tough time displaying a
convincing sense of purpose.
A Citizen's Charter here, a burst of deregulation there and a belated
crackdown on crime elsewhere cannot be expected to fill the gap. Nor can Mr
Major, caught by the Maastricht treaty, seek an escape route in his
predecessor's reflex nationalism. For the Conservatives, it seems, the end
of history has given way to the end of ideas.
It is a startling admission of failure - and perhaps just a little harsh on
the foreign secretary. Mr Hurd, it must be said, did make the point himself
that the government must now find itself a positive agenda.
He even offered Mr Major a five-point checklist - sustaining the economic
recovery, if deregulation, improving the quality of public services, winning
the argument in Europe and playing a 'decent' role on the world stage.
Nor are the Conservatives alone in their floundering in an ideological
vacuum. The Labour party is struggling still to strike a balance between its
new-found commitment to markets and old interventionist ways.
Mr John Smith is beginning to tap the seam of discontent caused by the
progressive erosion over the past 14 years of local democracy and
accountability. Mr Tony Blair has started to formulate a new rhetoric to put
his party's traditional commitment to collectivism in the framework of the
promotion of individual opportunity. But corporately, Labour appears gripped
by the same lack of imagination as the government.
It is Mr Major though who is suffering most from the aimless drift of
British politics. Surviving this week's Maastricht denouement and an
expected electoral disaster in the Christchurch by-election - and that is by
no means guaranteed - will not be enough for the prime minister.
His administration - accused even by its members of being obsessed with
gimmicks and wheezes - needs a sense of purpose. It needs focus.
Mr Chris Patten suggested once that Conservatism in the 1990s should be
about just three or four things: a stable legal framework, a prospering
economy and decent education and health care. That may not sound like a big
idea. But it is better than lamenting the demise of Mr Arthur Scargill.

FT  21 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: A who's who of Euro-sceptics -
Profile of the key Tory rebels in the Maastricht debate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NONE OF tomorrow's potential Tory rebels is saying publicly how they will
vote. But ministers' attentions are focused on whittling away at the group
of 30 or so Euro-sceptics who voted against the government at key points in
the Maastricht bill's passage through the Commons.
If just 10 of them rebel in tomorrow's vote and no opposition party breaks
ranks the government will be defeated.
If the Ulster Unionists abstain - they are seen as the party most likely to
be persuaded not to oppose the government - the number of rebels needed to
defeat the government would rise to 14. Should the nine Unionist MPs vote
with the government then 19 rebels would secure an opposition victory.
By last night, with relentlessly increasing pressure from government forces,
helped by reformed rebels and constituency associations, some Euro-sceptics
were showing signs of peeling off.
But there remains a hard core which even the whips do not expect to coax
into the government lobbies.
These are the ringleaders of the group that has stuck together throughout
the tortuous Maastricht committee stage, agreeing generally to vote as a
block in line with their self-styled whips' instructions. The rebel rump
still appears to include these MPs:
Mr Bill Cash, once described as the Tory party's white cliff of Dover, the
extravagantly prolix MP for Stafford, has made a key contribution to the
rebel campaign by providing the elegant Westminster town house for its nerve
centre. A qualified solicitor, he spoke for more than 2 1/2 hours during the
first debate on the Maastricht bill.
Sir Teddy Taylor, perhaps the canniest of the hardcore Euro-sceptics and MP
for Southend East who reached the pinnacle of his political career as a
junior Scottish Office minister in the 1970s. A logical and persuasive
speaker, he demonstrated a willingness to rebel against the government in
the 1980s, particularly on EC-related issues.
Mr Roger Knapman, the MP for Stroud, is a chartered surveyor and farmer who
has toiled away in the engine room of the Euro-sceptic campaign almost
unnoticed by the outside world. His low-profile political career was
previously marked by his ultra-loyalty.
Mr James Cran, one of the rebel whips and the soft-spoken but determined MP
for Beverley, is another of the unsung stalwarts of the Euro-sceptic
campaign. The Maastricht process has brought out a little-suspected and dry
sense of humour in this former CBI regional director.
Mr Christopher Gill is the other key Euro-sceptic organiser. This livestock
farmer exudes the courtly air of an old-style English gentleman. He is
nonetheless sometimes known as 'the butcher of Ludlow', the Shropshire
constituency he represents, in deference to his status as the man behind
Gill's sausages.
Mrs Teresa Gorman, one of the Essex Tories, is a trenchant campaigner for
more female MPs and among the most colourful Euro-sceptics in dress and
character. The MP for Billericay, she also criticised Mr John Major for
failing to appoint a woman to his first cabinet. Mr Michael Spicer, the
cultured MP for Worcestershire South, served as a junior minister in the
transport and energy departments during the 1980s. He was dropped by Mr
Major when he became prime minister in November 1990.
Mr John Carlisle, the drollest Euro-sceptic, has been Luton North MP for 14
years. He is best-known as a staunch long-term defender of South Africa.
Mr Tony Marlow, a stocky sergeant-major-type, has a record of rebelling
against the government during a 14-year parliamentary career. He shared with
Mr Cash the accolade of being the Tory rebel most likely to get under Mr
Michael Morris's skin while his fellow Northampton MP was presiding over the
Maastricht committee stage in his capacity as chairman of ways and means.
Mr Richard Shepherd, the MP for Aldridge-Brownhills, oozes impassioned
sincerity in every utterance about Maastricht. He is the only MP to list
searching for the Home Service on the wireless among his interests.
Mr Nicholas Winterton, the MP for Macclesfield, has had so many run-ins with
the government since being forced to stand down last year as chairman of the
Commons health committee that government whips jokingly regard him as
virtually an opposition member. The interests of British manufacturers is
another of his preoccupations.
Seventeen other Tory MPs have also defied the government on Maastricht at
critical moments and these will also be high on the whips' lists of MPs whom
they need to win over.

FT  21 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Unionist deal may hinge on EC aid
for province
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NORTHERN Ireland's Unionist MPs yesterday gave the strongest hints yet that
they are prepared to strike a deal with ministers which could help avoid a
government defeat over the social chapter on Thursday.
The nine Ulster Unionist MPs reckon their votes may well determine whether
the government is defeated. But the expectation at Westminster is that no
agreement would be reached until hours before the vote when the government
would calculate if it was worth brokering for the support or abstentions of
the nine Ulster Unionist MPs.
The government's campaign to secure Ulster Unionist support may be linked to
a complex agreement struck with Brussels over Northern Ireland's share of
special EC assistance funds. Security policy and a Commons committee on
Northern Ireland may also be part of any deal.
In the early hours of yesterday morning the UK government mounted a
desperate effort to preserve Northern Ireland's share of special EC
assistance reserved for poorer areas of high unemployment.
EC officials said the UK campaign appeared driven less by a desire to secure
extra money to sweeten the Ulster Unionists, but more by a fear that
Northern Ireland's position could be squeezed vis a vis Ireland.
Ireland is the biggest per-capita beneficiary of the Community's special
Objective One assistance. In the previous round, Dublin received two to 2
1/2 half times more funds per head than Greece, Portugal and Spain, who make
up the EC's 'Poor Four'. This amounts to around Ecu1,000 per Irish head over
the past five years - more than double Northern Ireland's share.
The UK argued, apparently successfully, that the gap between the Irish
Republic and Northern Ireland was likely to grow even further as a result
the 1994-99 EC budget deal which includes an Ecu15.5bn Cohesion Fund for the
Poor Four.
Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, agreed to take
account of the UK demands to preserve Northern Ireland's position.
He offered assurances that the UK would receive 2bn, the bulk of which is to
be divided between the poorest regions: the Highland and Islands, Merseyside
and Northern Ireland.
Unionists are also looking for and more powers for local councils in the
province, better scrutiny of Northern Ireland legislation in the Commons and
a commitment on Northern Ireland's constitutional position.
Although there appears to be no formal 'shopping list', the party's MPs had
little inhibition in setting parameters for any deal. The Rev Martin Smyth,
MP for south Belfast, said that for his colleagues to expect any movement by
the government on the 1985 Anglo-Irish Agreement  - hated by Unionists
because of the role it gives Dublin in Northern Ireland - was probably 'too
high a price' and could 'hamper their own negotiating position'.
Mr James Molyneaux, UUP leader, has deliberately kept a low profile over the
past week, doing little to dampen speculation that he is looking for a deal.
Three UUP MPs are due to meet Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland
secretary, tomorrow before the voting beings. But any deal is more likely to
be agreed in private negotiations between Mr Molyneaux and Mr Richard Ryder,
the government chief whip, and Mr John Major.

FT  21 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: PM signals determination to ratify
treaty
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR John Major yesterday hinted that he would press ahead with ratification
of the Maastricht treaty whatever the result of tomorrow's crucial Commons
vote on the social chapter.
His suggestion, echoed by Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, came as
the bill translating the treaty's provisions was finally enacted into law
when it received royal assent from the Queen.
The European Communities (Amendment) Act as it now becomes has absorbed more
time that any other legislation in recent parliamentary history. Its passage
through parliament involved 28 days of debate in the Commons and 12 days in
the Lords.
The government was defeated only once during 72 votes but was forced on
several occasions to accept opposition amendments - including that demanding
tomorrow's social chapter vote.
The prime minister's combative stance coincided also with fresh evidence
that the nine Ulster Unionist MPs may be ready to back the government in a
debate which has left on a knife edge Mr Major's political authority and the
future of the treaty.
But as both sides stepped up the war of nerves at Westminster, diehard Tory
Euro-sceptics claimed that they still had enough votes to overturn Mr
Major's Commons majority of 18.
One of the ringleaders of the anti-Maastricht group said that more than 15
of his colleagues had given firm pledges to vote against the government. He
also warned that if Mr Major decides to ignore a defeat tomorrow night then
some rebels would be prepared to again defy the government in any subsequent
vote of confidence.
That contrasted with signs of growing optimism among government whips who
yesterday stepped up their campaign to isolate the rebels in their
constituencies by accusing them of supporting Labour calls for the
imposition in Britain of the social chapter.
The government side claimed also a growing tide of support from grassroots
activists for the government's determination to ratify the treaty without
the social chapter.
Officials revealed that the 70 to 80 motions submitted by local associations
for debate at this autumn's party conference were running about 7 to 1 in
favour of the government. Only four demanded a referendum on the treaty and
large numbers congratulated Mr Major on the social chapter opt-out.
Mr Major's suggestion that the government might anyway ignore a defeat in
tomorrow's vote came during fierce Commons clashes with Mr John Smith, the
Labour leader. Mr Smith demanded assurances from the prime minister that he
would not seek to override the will of parliament.
But to the fury of Labour MPs Mr Major stressed repeatedly that enactment of
the Maastricht bill - with the social chapter opt-out intact - had already
provided the will of parliament. Pressed again on whether the government
would accept the social chapter if a majority of MPs voted for a Labour
amendment tomorrow evening Mr Major replied bluntly: 'You know that this
House does not support the social chapter.'

MR Peter Lilley, social security secretary, told the Commons last night
there could be no escape from 'structural reform' of the benefits system.
He insisted that it was necessary both to contain the growth of the Pounds
80bn social security budget and to ensure that the money was spent to best
effect.
The government secured a majority of 44 (312-268) to defeat a Labour motion
accusing it of seeking to dismantle the welfare state.
Mr Lilley said the underlying position of social security spending
outstripping national income could not be sustained indefinitely.
Accepting the need for a 'considered look' at the social security budget, Mr
Donald Dewar, shadow social security secretary, warned that Labour would
battle against short-term reforms stemming from the Treasury's 'crisis
management demands'.
Mr Lilley identified three main sources of expenditure - invalidity and
related benefits, lone parents and housing benefit - for the projected
growth in social security provision to the end of the century.
Mr Lilley accepted that growth in lone parenthood - up from 570,000 in 1971
to 1.3m in 1991 - was not likely to be checked primarily by changes in the
benefit system.
The availability of housing was a significant factor, he said, and welcomed
a recent statement by Mr David Blunkett, shadow health secretary, calling
for positive housing policies which did not encourage the belief that having
a baby was the only way to a home.

His emphasis on developing areas of the domestic agenda intended to appeal

At the annual end-of-term private meeting with the Association of
Conservative Peers, Mr Major left no doubt that next session's legislative

FT  21 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Dublin angered by Tebbit remarks
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Irish government is to raise with Britain remarks made by Lord Tebbit
about bomb attacks on Dublin.
During a Sky TV programme on Monday night on Ireland's controversial
constitutional territorial claim on Ulster, the former Conservative party
chairman declared: 'I suspect that the only thing that will take that out of
the Irish constitution is when the bombs begin to blow in Dublin in the way
that they have been in Belfast and in London.'
Last night Irish prime minister Mr Albert Reynolds called the comments
'deplorable' - and made it clear his views were being relayed to London.
Outlawed loyalist paramilitary group the Ulster Freedom Fighters yesterday
planted bombs outside the homes of three nationalist SDLP politicians,
including West Belfast MP Dr Joe Hendron. Two bombs went off and a third was
defused. No one was hurt.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR yesterday called for an end to the ban on British Telecommunications
providing entertainment services in return for its agreement to reduce
'drastically' the number of people without a phone, Andrew Adonis writes.
Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary, said the 10-year ban -
imposed by the government two years ago to encourage cable TV companies to
build local phone and cable TV networks - was 'grossly unfair'.
He said: 'Its only benefit is to BT's international rivals. North American
telecoms companies have major stakes in 93 per cent of cable TV operators.
'It is a disincentive to BT to invest in the UK, forcing it to spend its
money abroad,' he added, pointing to BT's recent Dollars 4.3bn investment in
MCI, the second-largest US operator.
BT welcomed Labour's support for an end to the entertainment ban, which it
claims is anti-competitive and a hindrance to its capacity to finance an
advanced fibre-optic network within local exchanges, but it refused to
concede the need for further reductions in connection charges to increase
lines.

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ECONOMY needs an immediate Pounds 10bn-Pounds 15bn injection of publicly
funded investment if unemployment is not to continue to grow, two Labour
leftwingers will today argue.
In a Tribune group pamphlet advocating a new strategy for jobs and growth,
Mr Roger Berry, the MP for Kingswood, and Mr Peter Hain, the MP for Neath,
will call for tax increases for individuals earning more than Pounds 50,000
per annum.
Expressing support for existing Labour policies designed to strengthen the
supply side of the economy, the pamphlet will nonetheless argue that these
are not in themselves enough. 'There has been little to distinguish Labour's
macroeconomic policy from that of the Tories,' the MPs will say.
But the document came under immediate attack from Mr Nigel Griffiths, a
Labour trade and industry spokesman and a Tribune member. Mr Griffiths said
the pamphlet showed 'political naivety and economic illiteracy'.
Proposals for cutting public spending, except on health and education, by
between 25 per cent and 50 per cent by the end of the century, were
published yesterday by the Bow Group, a Conservative think tank.
The report suggested streamlining the tax and social security system,
including introducing a 'basic income' to replace the benefit system, and
reducing the number of civil servants.
It also suggested further cuts in defence spending.

FT  21 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Agencies to set codes of conduct
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GOVERNMENT enforcement agencies will be obliged to publish codes of conduct
by next January, under proposals produced by the the government's 'red tape'
review.
The agencies - public bodies including the Civil Aviation Authority, the
Pollution Inspectorate and the Health and Safety Executive - will be
required to produce codes covering standards, complaints procedures, value
for money, and 'courtesy and helpfulness'.
The code is one of the few definite new proposals in yesterday's 'progress
report' by the deregulation team at the Department of Trade and Industry,
following a meeting of ministers with the prime minister and Lord Sainsbury,
the government's deregulation adviser.
Mr Tim Sainsbury, standing in for Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry
secretary, said an 'important' Deregulation Bill was under consideration,
but he refused to disclose the matters it would cover and said its
introduction would only come 'as soon as parliamentary time permits'.
Mr Sainsbury - Lord Sainsbury's brother - said: 'Deregulation is a vital
element in helping to improve the competitiveness of British industry:
reviews of departments' regulations are now yielding major prospects for
change.'
Proposals under consideration include the ending of remaining restrictions
on weekday shop opening in England and Wales; a review of key areas of food
law including hygiene, labelling and enforcement; a green paper on the
regulation of taxis and minicabs; and a change in the licensing regime for
heavy goods vehicles and buses.
The Department of Social Security and Inland Revenue will take a 'fresh
look' at rules governing the designation of people as self-employed, and the
DSS will review the statutory sick pay regime.
Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, has set up a working group to
look at the burden of different definitions of earning for tax and national
insurance purposes.

Mr Cook said Britain's level of telephone 'penetration' - about 85 per cent
of households - was low compared with other industrial countries. 'In the
modern age, access to the telephone is as important as access to the postal
service.'
BT welcomed Labour's support for an end to the entertainment ban, which it
claims is anti-competitive and a hindrance to its capacity to finance an
advanced fibre-optic network within local exchanges. It refused to concede
the need for further reductions in connection charges to increase lines.
Last month the cost of installing a phone line was reduced from Pounds 152
to Pounds 99, cut to Pounds 36.78 for those taking over an existing exchange
line and set at zero for those doing so immediately the previous occupant
has moved.

THE Commons transport committee yesterday delivered a strongly worded
warning that underground and rail services in London would rapidly decline
without a big increase in investment, Richard Tomkins writes.
In a report on transport investment in the capital, MPs said they had
received clear evidence from both Network SouthEast and London Underground
that present levels of investment were insufficient to maintain or improve
the transport system.
They acknowledged that investment in London's transport in the past few
years had been higher than in previous decades, but said earlier
under-investment had 'heaped up trouble' for the future.
The report recommended a government commitment to a sustained and higher
level of investment.

FT  21 JUL 93 / Press is favoured as TV 'flounders'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TELEVISION is declining in significance and newspapers will continue to have
considerable advantages over the electronic media, a report on the future of
the media by the Henley Centre consultancy group says.
The study, backed by an opinion survey by Research International, found the
attraction of television waning, with 60 per cent of respondents saying that
they would rather go out and do other things and 42 per cent saying most
television programmes were 'dull and predictable'.
A widening income gap is also having a significant impact on the number of
hours people watch, with the poorest watching 11 hours a week more than the
richest, it says.
The Henley Centre suggests a 'cultural underclass' may be developing, with
those on lowest incomes restricted to the relatively cheap entertainment of
television while those on higher incomes can pay for wider leisure choices.
Saturation with television, the study argues, explains the slowdown in
satellite dish sales. It predicts a maximum of 4m to 4.5m dish households by
the end of the century.
It says: 'Satellite programmes are valuable add-ons but are not part of
mainstream British viewing habits and are unlikely to become so.' Cable
television, on the other hand, could prosper because of its capability for
interaction between viewers and the programme providers.
The Henley study argues that in spite of concern about declining newspaper
circulations they are still an integral part of many people's lives.
Research International found that 25 per cent of people talked every day
about what they read in the newspapers compared to 27 per cent who talked
about a television programme.
It says the role of newspapers will change to accommodate the greater
immediacy of radio and television.

FT  21 JUL 93 / Welsh nuclear plant to close
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NUCLEAR ELECTRIC is to close the Trawsfynydd power station in Snowdonia,
north Wales, two years earlier than planned, Michael Smith writes. It says
the price of resolving the concerns of health and safety inspectors could be
too high.
The station, which employs 490 people, will be the third of Britain's
nuclear stations to close. Nuclear Electric said there were no implications
for its other six operating Magnox stations, which are expected to continue
for several years, some beyond the end of the century.
Trawsfynydd stopped producing electricity in February 1991 because of cracks
in its pressure vessels.
Modifications have cost more than Pounds 6m and Nuclear Electric said it
strongly believed in the safety plan it had put to the Nuclear Installations
Inspectorate. However, satisfying the inspectorate's further questions would
divert resources.
Nuclear Electric said Trawsfynydd had in effect been losing about Pounds 50m
a year income from electricity sales for the past two years. Decommissioning
the plant would cost Pounds 230m at today's prices and would take 100 to 135
years.

FT  21 JUL 93 / Business protest on Bristol rejection
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM, Wales and West Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUSINESS groups representing more than 2,000 companies yesterday protested
at the rejection by the Local Government Commission of a greater Bristol in
its proposals for abolishing the county of Avon.
In an open letter to Sir John Banham, commission chairman, the groups accuse
the commission of ignoring strategic matters such as transport and planning,
of failing to ensure that Bristol would have sufficient funds to deal with
social issues such as homelessness and urban decay, and of overlooking the
need for the city to develop as an important European city to attract inward
investment.
The groups backing the protest are the Bristol Chamber of Commerce and
Initiative, the Confederation of British Industry's south-west region, the
Institute of Directors, the Federation for Small Businesses and the Bristol
Property Agents' Association.
The commission has proposed that Bristol becomes a unitary authority within
its historic boundaries and rejected the case, supported by the
Labour-controlled city council, for its boundaries to be extended to include
much of the urban area to the north and west of the city.
These urban areas are now part of the district councils of Northavon and
Kingswood, which the commission has proposed should form a single unitary
authority, although both are arguing that they should be individual
authorities.
Mr John Savage, chief executive of the Bristol chamber, said: 'The business
community is outraged by the commission's recommendations, which would
create a unitary authority for Bristol that lacks the critical mass to
tackle key strategic issues.'
The commission accepted that there were strong arguments in favour of a
greater Bristol but said there was strong opposition from the communities in
Northavon and Kingswood.
Mr Alan Smith, chief executive of Kingswood council, yesterday accused the
chamber of arrogance in promoting the Bristol interest at 'the expense of
the traditions, loyalties and identities of established communities'.

FT  21 JUL 93 / SIB orders building society to check advice
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NORTH of England Building Society, the UK's 20th largest society, has been
ordered by regulators to contact 600 customers who may have been misled when
sold pensions or investment products.
The Securities and Investments Board, which regulates the society, conducted
an inspection visit last October.
The Department of Social Security has asked regulators overseeing the sale
of personal pensions to ensure that they are not sold to those for whom they
are inappropriate. The board, along with Lautro and Fimbra, the
self-regulatory organisations for life insurers and independent financial
advisers respectively, had told sales agents not to encourage members of
occupational schemes to transfer to personal pensions.
The board, which has been criticised by the retail financial services
industry for being less rigorous a regulator than the self-regulatory
bodies, has stepped up its reviews of sales tactics. Recently, Barclays Bank
and National Westminster Bank, both regulated by SIB, have said they will
stop accepting pensions transfers.
The board's review at North of England raised questions about the quality of
advice given to those who had transferred out of their existing pension
arrangements and those who had purchased so-called single premium
with-profits bonds.
Regulators had been concerned that with-profits bonds had been sold as
high-yielding alternatives to building society deposit accounts and that
customers did not understand the heavy penalties for early withdrawal.
The society said SIB had ordered it to offer all 600 customers the chance to
have their cases reviewed by an separate independent financial adviser and
make restitution where necessary. So far, 163 have requested advice.
North of England has announced it will no longer be an independent financial
adviser and said it would sell only the products of General Accident Company
from September 1.
It added: 'We felt the cost of compliance for an independent financial
adviser was too great for a building society of our size,' it said.

FT  21 JUL 93 / Guarantee expected on BR pensions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT is expected to announce later today a solvency guarantee for
British Rail's pension scheme to insure payment of full pensions following
privatisation even if the scheme's investment income falls sharply.
The scheme's trustees spent yesterday with ministers hammering out a
compromise which would allow trustees to support a restructuring of the
scheme following privatisation.
The trustees, who include representatives of BR management and employees,
had warned that without the solvency guarantees, future pensions could be at
risk. They argued that their legal duty as trustees forbade them to approve
scheme changes which would leave members worse off than they had been.
The extent of the guarantees and how they will be applied is to be announced
in a joint statement from the government and the BR pension scheme board of
trustees.
The trustees' case for guarantees was believed to have been strengthened by
news that the actuarial valuation due to be completed in October will show
the Pounds 1bn surplus of three years ago to have fallen by two-thirds.
The government has retreated successively from its hard-line stance on
post-privatisation plans for the BR scheme. It had first proposed seizing a
portion of the scheme's Pounds 8.5bn assets and promising in return to
guarantee an annual increase for all pensions in line with inflation.
Instead, the government has said it would use the assets to create an
ongoing scheme for all current members who remain employed in the rail
industry. A portion of the assets will be hived off to create a separate
scheme for current and deferred pensioners - now roughly 150,000.

FT  21 JUL 93 / Police launch campaign against Sheehy changes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
POLICE OFFICERS staged the biggest demonstration in their history last night
in protest against the Sheehy committee's recommendations for radical
changes in pay and conditions.
More than 20,000 officers from throughout the UK filled London's Wembley
Arena and overflow halls. They launched a campaign to force the government
to abandon the recommendations, which include fixed-term contracts and
performance-related pay.
Police officers are banned by law from taking strike action, and last
night's exceptional demonstration was the most dramatic form of public
opposition to the proposals open to them. But Mr Alan Eastwood, chairman of
the Police Federation, warned that the rally was 'only the very small
beginning of our struggle' to defeat Sheehy. It marked the start of a
'campaign to save the service from the disaster of this report'.
The rally was organised by the federation, which represents officers up to
the rank of chief inspector, and the Superintendents' Association. Mr
Richard Wells, chief constable of South Yorkshire, said that the Sheehy
committee had viewed the police service through 'tight, prejudiced, narrow
fiscal windows'. Officers felt sick with worry over their own futures and
that of the service, he added.
Mr Michael Howard, home secretary, is holding consultations on the
recommendations until September, and has stressed that he has not yet
reached conclusions on any of them. Police reform and the fight against
crime have become high-profile political questions for the government. It is
due to legislate on proposals to make police authorities more businesslike
and on those aspects of Sheehy accepted by the government in the next
parliamentary session.
Last night's rally was addressed by Mr Tony Blair, shadow home secretary,
and Mr Robert Maclennan, Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman. Mr
Maclennan received a standing ovation for a speech in which he described the
Sheehy report as a malevolent exercise whose primary purpose was to cut the
cost of policing rather than improve it.
Mr Blair said the test of police reforms must be whether they helped cut
crime rather than help the Treasury to cut corners.

FT  21 JUL 93 / Iraq arms inquiry 'does not understand priorities'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SENIOR diplomat yesterday accused the judge and two senior lawyers leading
the UK arms-to-Iraq inquiry of not understanding the machinery of British
government.
Sir David Miers, UK ambassador to the Netherlands, told the inquiry team:
'You have a misunderstanding about the volume of work and the priorities.
You are misunderstanding how the system works.'
This is the first time that an inquiry witness has attacked the way it is
conducted. The outburst is understood to reflect growing unease within
Whitehall at the way the inquiry is subjecting to critical scrutiny the
actions of senior civil servants during the 1980s.
Sir David, a former assistant under-secretary at the Foreign Office
responsible for Middle East affairs, was facing repeated questioning by Lord
Justice Scott, his counsel Ms Presiley Baxendale QC, and Mr Christopher
Muttukumaru, an assistant Treasury solicitor and secretary to the inquiry,
about apparent failings by officials to abide by government guidelines
restricting defence exports to Iraq.
Sir David was asked whether he did not think it was his responsibility to
have prevented UK defence equipment from going to Jordan in the 1980s after
receiving intelligence information that the country was being used as a
route for arms to Iraq.
Sir David told Lord Justice Scott that the judge needed to look at decisions
in Whitehall within the context they were taken at the time. 'We were trying
to sell things rather than stop them, and this was being carried out at the
highest level. The whole British government machine from senior ministers
down were trying to conduct a campaign to sell arms to Jordan.'
In September 1985 the government signed a memorandum of understanding with
Jordan which resulted in a Pounds 270m defence package arranged by
International Military Services, a defence company wholly owned by the
Ministry of Defence.
Sir David also hit back when he was questioned about his apparent failure to
ensure that restrictions on the exports of machine tools by British
manufacturers including Matrix Churchill were not enforced.
Documents made available to the Scott inquiry show that Sir David was a
recipient on November 30 1987 of an intelligence report that British lathes
were being used to make shell casings at military industrial complexes in
Iraq.
Sir David said blocking the export of machine tools to Iraq may have led to
financial difficulties for the companies. He added: 'The question was, could
one justify a decision which would have these catastrophic results, with
real people being thrown out of work, when it all turned upon the semantic
exercise of exactly how the guidelines should be drawn up or interpreted.'
The public hearing was adjourned until Tuesday.

FT  21 JUL 93 / Lloyd's wins court action
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LLOYD'S yesterday won the latest stage in a long-running legal action, when
Mr Justice Saville ruled that five Canadian banks must allow the insurance
market to draw on letters of credit taken out by Canadian Names as security
for their Lloyd's membership.
Names, the individuals whose capital supports underwriting at the market,
have lost more than Pounds 6bn in the past five years. More than 17,000
Names are either taking or considering legal action.
Five banks - the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, the Toronto Dominion
Bank, the Bank of Nova Scotia, the Bank of Montreal and the National Bank of
Canada - refused to allow Lloyd's to draw on the letters of credit on the
grounds that their clients, more than a dozen Canadian Names, had alleged
the losses were due to fraud.
Lloyd's took action against the banks in January. Mr Saville said in
yesterday's judgment in the Commercial Court that the banks must themselves
plead fraud if they continue to withhold monies.
The Canadian Names are among several thousand who have lost heavily at
Lloyd's as a result of membership of syndicates managed by the Gooda Walker
agency. Seventeen Canadians are among a group of more than 150 Names against
whom Lloyd's has served writs to force payment.

FT  21 JUL 93 / Doubt cast on potential rail operators
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR MONTHS the government has maintained that at least 50 companies are
interested in bidding for the franchises to operate British Rail's passenger
services.
Yet inquiries among airline and shipping groups, bus companies and other
transport-related businesses in the UK and overseas give a different
impression - barely a third of the government's number are looking at just a
handful of local services.
Bus companies emerge as the groups most interested in railway privatisation,
having only recently emerged from their own privatisation and deregulation
outside London in the late 1980s.
The three biggest bus companies - Badgerline, British Bus and Stagecoach -
are considering bids for franchises which fall broadly into their areas of
operations. Many smaller bus companies are looking at the possibility of
bids for individual lines or groups of services in their areas.
The logic behind these bids is that bus companies believe they can increase
revenues from the railways by integrating train services with their
operations through common ticketing and co-ordinated timetabling. Yet this
would invite intervention by the Office of Fair Trading on the grounds of
local monopoly.
The monopoly issue would matter less if the bus companies bid for operations
outside their areas. But most of them will not - least of all for the
InterCity and Network SouthEast franchises, which would dwarf their existing
operations.
Mr Harry Blundred, chairman of Exeter-based Transit Holdings and one of the
most entrepreneurial of the new breed of bus operators, said: 'It seems to
us that if you make one tiny mistake in a business you don't know, you could
be in all kinds of trouble. We have looked at it and backed off.'
Few other companies seem ready to take the bus companies' place as bidders
for the large franchises. British Airways has said it is only interested in
running airport expresses. Mr Richard Branson's Virgin Group has lost
interest in the Gatwick Express and only wants to run the East Coast main
line as part of a consortium.
National Express has said the bids it wants to make would probably break the
government's rules, though it has declined to elaborate. So would those
being contemplated by Sea Containers, which wants the government to let it
run the tracks as well as the trains.
As for overseas interest, Canadian Pacific is interested in the Heathrow
Express, and only Burlington Northern of the large US railroads is
interested in franchising.
Contrary to popular myth, SNCF, the French national railway, says it has too
many financial problems at home to consider a foreign venture.
The government has refused to identify the 50 companies on its list. But
some in the private sector say the reason for the discrepancy between that
figure and reality rests with the list, which includes interested parties
that want to keep in touch with what is going on.

<TEXT>
THE BIGGEST police demonstration in history last night launched a campaign
to compel the government to abandon the Sheehy committee's recommendations
for changing the service's pay and conditions.
More than 16,000 police officers from throughout the UK filled London's
Wembley Arena and overflow halls to protest against proposals which include
introducing fixed-term contracts and performance-related pay.
Mr Alan Eastwood, chairman of the Police Federation which represents all

Sheehy recommendations, the rally would prove 'only the very small beginning

Legislation to make police authorities more businesslike, and to introduce
whatever recommendations of the report accepted by the government is due in
the autumn.
The associations representing all ranks of police officers, including chief
constables, are particularly concerned that nobody on the committee had any
policing experience.
Mr Eastwood said that Mr Kenneth Clarke, home secretary when the Sheehy
inquiry was established, had assembled a hand-picked team to 'produce a
report that would confirm his prejudices'.
Mr Michael Howard, home secretary, is considering responses to the
recommendations until September.

BRITAIN'S oil rig industry is in danger of collapse after losing 15,000 of
its 20,000-strong workforce over the past 15 months, a group of MPs claimed
yesterday. Two yards are on 90 days notice of closure and one is open on a
care-and-maintenance basis only, Mr Henry McLeish, Labour MP for Fife
Central, said.
MPs from all parties called on the government to safeguard existing yards
which are facing growing competition from overseas and possible cutbacks
because of changes in North Sea taxes. The MPs called for the proposed
changes to petroleum revenue taxes to be suspended.

FT  21 JUL 93 / Clinton appoints judge to FBI helm
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton yesterday named Mr Louis Freeh as new director of the
Federal Bureau of Investigation.
Mr Freeh, a former FBI agent and prosecutor and now a federal judge in New
York, was widely tipped for the job. He will replace Mr William Sessions,
who was fired by Mr Clinton earlier this week.
The appointment, which is subject to confirmation by the Senate, will
complete the Clinton administration's law enforcement line-up with a third
figure drawn from the field of big city criminal justice.
Although Mr Clinton's first choices for attorney-general were drawn from the
ranks of corporate law, Ms Janet Reno, now installed as the star of the
Clinton cabinet, was a criminal prosecutor in Miami. Mr Lee Brown, director
of drug control policy and another cabinet member, served as police chief in
Atlanta, Houston and New York.
Mr Freeh, whose record includes the break-up of the 'pizza connection'
heroin ring and the investigation of a series of letter bombs, has a
reputation as a tough law enforcement professional.
He faces the immediate task of restoring leadership at an agency whose
divisional heads have often been accused of acting as independent barons.
Mr Sessions' leadership had been impaired since a Justice Department report
in January accused him of abusing the perks of office, but it is widely
believed he never succeeded in taking the agency in hand.
The delay in appointing Ms Reno as attorney-general and in replacing Mr
Sessions at the head of the FBI has left the Clinton administration lagging
in crime policy.
Some politicians can scarcely believe Mr Clinton has not yet pushed for
action on his crime agenda, which they feel could provide him with the
relatively easy victory in Congress that has so regularly eluded him.
His campaign crime programme included proposals to put 100,000 more police
officers on the streets with the creation of a national police corps, to put
more money into community policing and drug treatment programmes, and to
pass gun control laws.

FT  21 JUL 93 / Housing upturn remains muted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEW COMMITMENTS by building societies to mortgages recovered in June from a
fall the previous month, figures released yesterday show. However, they
provided further evidence that the housing market recovery remains muted.
The Building Societies Association disclosed that net new mortgage
commitments rose to Pounds 3.18bn last month from Pounds 2.78bn in May. The
Pounds 9.14bn figure for the second quarter was marginally lower than the
Pounds 9.19bn in the same period last year. But this includes only building
society lending, and banks have been increasing their market share of
mortgage loans.
The association said societies suffered their first month of net outflow
this year, after a Pounds 700m inflow of retail funds in May.
However, net receipts of retail funds stood at Pounds 1.7bn in the second
quarter compared with Pounds 77m in the second quarter of last year.
Societies have been trying to attract more funds after a net inflow of only
Pounds 295m last year.
Mr Adrian Coles, association director-general, said the advances figures
confirmed that the housing market was recovering slowly. Lending was
'significantly higher' than in the first quarter.
Net new commitments to mortgages in the second quarter had risen 24 per cent
on the first quarter, he said, while figures for the second quarter of last
year had been boosted by the deadline to avoid stamp duty on house
purchases.
The outflow of retail funds following strong inflows in April and May was
'not unexpected', given the BT3 share offer which had 'undoubtedly had a
depressing effect on receipts last month'.
Mr John Wriglesworth, building society analyst at UBS Securities, said the
figures indicated that the housing market was still 'bumping along the
bottom' with little sign of a strong recovery in mortgage lending levels.
He said societies were facing strong competition from banks for mortgage
lending because it was more expensive to obtain new retail funds for
lending, compared with borrowing on wholesale money markets.

FT  21 JUL 93 / Lower M4 signals fragile recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DEMAND FOR new credit is weak, according to money-supply data issued
yesterday which indicate the upturn will be fragile.
The M4 measure of the money supply, which takes in bank and building society
deposits and notes and coins in circulation, fell a seasonally adjusted 0.2
per cent in June - its biggest monthly decrease since the Bank of England
started records in 1982.
After the fall in M4, the measure was 3.3 per cent higher than a year
previously. This compares with a 3.8 per cent rise in the 12 months to May.
Bank and building society lending to the private sector last month totalled
Pounds 700m, after Pounds 1.9bn in May. The muted demand for lending was
mainly due to companies requiring little finance from banks as they issued
new shares to fund operations and pay off debts.
The Bank said the M4 figure was distorted partly by the system for seasonal
adjustments, which tends to depress money-supply numbers in the third month
of every quarter when lending institutions charge interest. Another factor
pushing down M4 was high sales of gilt-edged securities in June.
The Bank gained about Pounds 2bn more in gilt sales than it needed to cover
the public sector borrowing requirement, so draining cash from the private
sector.
The message that borrowing by companies and individuals has yet to see any
big jump was underscored by figures from the British Bankers' Association,
covering lending by the UK's nine biggest commercial banks. These banks lent
a net, seasonally adjusted Pounds 800m in June, after Pounds 1.15bn in May.
On an unadjusted basis manufacturers repaid Pounds 776m in bank loans during
the month as many companies raised large sums from rights issues.
Construction companies repaid Pounds 117m while building societies and
securities dealers took on new loans worth a net Pounds 515m and Pounds 303m
respectively.
The number of people who think economic conditions will worsen has increased
over the past month, a survey by Gallup, the market-research organisation,
shows.
A third of the 1,996 adults polled this month were pessimistic about the
economy, compared with 28 per cent who were hopeful. That gives a negative
balance of 5 percentage points.
In a similar survey in June, a balance of 1 point thought economic
conditions were turning down. This came after a survey in May in which a
balance of 21 percentage points thought the economy was improving.

FT  21 JUL 93 / Economists in City 'head pay league'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BIG PAY rises for City economists in the past two years have pushed their
salaries well above those of economists in other sectors, a survey by the
Society of Business Economists says, Peter Marsh writes.
The average salary of an economist in financial services, mainly in the
City, was Pounds 52,800 at the start of this year, up 38.9 per cent on the
Pounds 38,000 paid in 1991.
Economists in banking and production industries were paid an average of
Pounds 38,200 and Pounds 38,000, 7 per cent and 11.7 per cent up
respectively on two years previously. In the consultancy field economists
suffered a 3.8 per cent fall in their average salaries, to Pounds 39,000
from Pounds 40,500 in 1991.
The figures do not include bonuses and other fringe benefits.
Since 1988 the pay of financial-services economists has risen by 71.4 per
cent while the comparable figures for economists in banking, consultancy and
production industries are 29 per cent, 14.3 per cent and 35.7 per cent
respectively.

FT  21 JUL 93 / Greenspan upbeat on US economy: Strong second half forecast
by Federal Reserve chairman
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US economy has regained momentum after a disappointing first quarter, Mr
Alan Greenspan, Federal Reserve chairman, said yesterday in a generally
upbeat assessment of economic trends.
He signalled a potentially important change in the way the central bank
assesses monetary conditions by emphasising that increased attention is
being paid to the level of real or inflation-adjusted interest rates. Since
real short-term rates have been close to zero for a year, many analysts
interpreted his remarks as an oblique signal that the Fed is looking for an
opportunity to nudge rates higher.
Delivering his twice-yearly monetary report to Congress, Mr Greenspan also
warned that financial markets would respond negatively and push up long-term
interest rates if congressional negotiators failed to achieve the Clinton
administration's goal of Dollars 500bn (Pounds 333.3bn) in deficit reduction
over the next five years.
Mr Greenspan brushed aside fears that the economic recovery is faltering.
'Smoothing through the quarterly pattern, the economy appears to have
accelerated gradually over the past two years.' Gross domestic product
appeared to have grown at an annual rate of close to 3 per cent in the
second quarter, a sharp improvement on growth of 0.7 per cent in the first
three months.
Nearly 1m new jobs had been created since the beginning of the year.
But performance on inflation had been disappointing this year.
'Despite disinflationary forces and continued slack, the rate of inflation
has at best stabilised, rather than easing further as past relationships
would have suggested,' he said.
Mr Greenspan said the relationships between money and national income and
prices had largely broken down, depriving the monetary aggregates of their
usefulness as guides to policy. He announced a reduction in the target for
M2, a broad measure of money, to 1-5 per cent this year rather than 2-6 per
cent as announced in February. However, this was only a technical adjustment
and did not reflect a tightening of policy.
Because the money figures were so unreliable, the Fed was putting more
emphasis on real interest rates as a monetary guidepost, reflecting their
'key bearing on longer-run spending decisions and inflation prospects'.
He said it was important to prevent real rates moving too far from a
long-term 'equilibrium rate' - the rate consistent with steady
non-inflationary growth.
If interest rates were held below this level for too long, bottlenecks and
inflationary pressures would be created, eventually leading to another
economic contraction.
In a strong hint that the next move in short-term rates would be up, Mr
Greenspan noted that real short rates had been 'in the neighbourhood of
zero' for nine months. Long-term real rates, over which the Fed had little
control, were appreciably higher, indicating that financial markets expected
a rise in short rates.
Mr Greenspan said the Clinton deficit reduction package should be regarded
as only a first step toward fiscal consolidation. 'We are going to have to
take another shot at the deficit,' he said.
He refused to comment on the detail of congressional negotiations but
repeated previous warnings that unless action was taken to reduce the rate
of spending growth, ever- increasing rates of taxation would be needed to
balance the budget.
While predicting a stronger second half, Mr Greenspan said the Fed had
revised down its forecasts for economic growth since February. The 'central
tendency' was now for growth of 2.25-2.5 per cent in the year to the fourth
quarter of 1993, against a projection of 3-3.25 per cent six months ago.
The Clinton administration also recently reduced its growth forecast for
1993 from 3.1 per cent to about 2.5 per cent.
The Fed has grown more pessimistic on inflation, following unexpectedly
sharp price increases early in the year. The latest forecast is for an
increase in the consumer price index of 3-3.25 this year against a
projection of 2.5-2.75 in February.
For 1994 the Fed is projecting economic growth of 2.5-3.25 per cent and
inflation of 3-3.5 per cent.
Mr Greenspan said these modest growth rates reflected the impact of
structural drags on the economy, such as cuts in defence spending and weak
balance sheets after excessive borrowing in the 1980s.
However, provided the US got to grips with the budget deficit and challenge
of healthcare reform, the US economy would 'eventually emerge healthier and
more vibrant than in decades'.

FT  21 JUL 93 / London looses more than a quarter of small businesses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LONDON HAS lost more than a quarter of its small businesses since 1990, the
London Enterprise Agency and the Labour-dominated Association of London
Authorities say in a survey published today, Charles Batchelor writes.
They report that the number of businesses with annual sales of less than
Pounds 100,000 fell from 126,600 to 93,500 between 1990 and 1992. About
15,000 jobs were lost from inner London and 18,000 from the suburbs.
The decline of small businesses was greater than that of businesses as a
whole. The total number of businesses fell 12 per cent from 243,000 to
213,500. However, the number of businesses with turnover of Pounds 1m or
more rose 5 per cent to 26,000.
The agency and the association were concerned that the disproportionate fall
in the number of small businesses could have serious implications for future
job creation.
During the last period of economic growth up to 1989 businesses employing
fewer than 10 people generated more than half of all new jobs in inner
London.
They were particularly concerned at the loss of small businesses in sectors
such as distribution, catering, banking, finance and services which account
for nearly half the capital's jobs.

FT  21 JUL 93 / CAA raps government stance on Dan-Air
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT damaged the UK's ability to stop anti-competitive airline
mergers in the European Community by allowing British Airways to take over
its rival Dan-Air last year, Mr Christopher Chataway, chairman of the Civil
Aviation Authority, said yesterday.
Mr Chataway, a former Conservative minister, said the deal should have been
referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. He added: 'The approval
will not make it easier for the UK to argue for a strong competition policy
within the EC.'
BA said yesterday: 'If the merger had not been approved when it was Dan-Air
would have disappeared overnight. We do not believe refusing this merger
would have been in the best interests of the travelling public, Dan-Air or
its staff.'
The Department of Trade and Industry said ministers had noted 'competition
concerns' at the time but that 'factors in the public interest' won the day.
Mr Chataway, presenting the CAA's annual report, also warned the Treasury
that cutting the CAA's borrowing powers would hit investment in air traffic
control and could increase delays to passengers in the UK's crowded
airports.
As a public body the CAA borrows from the Treasury. It borrowed Pounds 56m
last year, below its ceiling of Pounds 65.5m, and fears that the ceiling
will be reduced as a result.
'It is absolutely essential that we are able to borrow significantly. If we
don't, we can easily see a return to the delays of the late 1980s,' said Mr
Chataway.
The CAA annual report says that improvements in air traffic control led last
year to a sharp fall in airport waiting times.
Average delays on outbound flights from UK airports in May and June this
year were just seven minutes, compared with 14 minutes in May and June 1992.
The average delay on domestic flights in the same period was also seven
minutes - down from 20 minutes.
Early evening UK-bound flights from Belgium and Germany were subject to
delays of up to two hours early last year.
This had been cut to 30 minutes.
Mr Chataway added that the single market had heightened concern about the
charges made to cover the costs of safety regulations in the EC. It was only
in the UK that the full costs were recovered from the industry.
He added: 'To avoid damaging distortions, we must press for early
implementation of a common funding policy throughout the EC for safety
regulation.'

FT  21 JUL 93 / Inquiry casts cloud over Washington budget talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE fate of President Bill Clinton's budget package has fallen under the
shadow of a federal investigation into the finances of Congressman Dan
Rostenkowski, who as chairman of the House of Representatives' ways and
means committee is the dominant budget negotiator.
Mr Rostenkowski, a Chicago politician who has become one of Washington's
premier deal-makers, has been the most prominent target of a probe that
began with allegations of drug dealing over the counter of the House's
private post office before turning its attention to charges of embezzlement
by members of Congress.
Mr Robert Rota, the former House postmaster, pleaded guilty on Monday to
three misdemeanour charges of embezzlement and conspiracy, admitting he had
aided and abetted two congressmen in wilfully and knowingly embezzling
government money.
While the two members are identified only as A and B, documents filed with
the guilty plea show dates and amounts of vouchers submitted to the post
office which match vouchers already in the public record from Mr
Rostenkowski and Mr Joseph Kolter, a former congressman from Pennsylvania.
Mr Ramsey Johnson, the US prosecutor handling the case, said Mr Rota's plea,
made in exchange for an agreement to drop additional charges, 'will greatly
aid our ability to resolve the allegations of corruption at the House post
office'.
Despite the two-year investigation, however, no charges have been filed
against Mr Rostenkowski or Mr Kolter. Mr Rostenkowski made no comment
yesterday but has in the past described the investigation, initiated by Mr
Jay Stephens, a Republican appointee with political ambitions, as a 'fishing
expedition and political witchhunt'.
Mr Rostenkowski's importance as an ally in Mr Clinton's battle to win
passage for the budget bill was underscored by the bill's mauling in the
Senate. Where Mr Rostenkowski was able to win passage for a bill that
closely resembled the original version proposed by Mr Clinton, Senate
Democratic leaders were unable to rein in their oil state members, who
gutted the legislation of its proposed energy tax.
In negotiations to reconcile the different versions passed by the two
chambers, which get under way in earnest this week, Mr Rostenkowski's role
is expected to be critical.
If indicted, however, he would be compelled by House Democratic rules to
step aside as chairman of the ways and means committee - a prospect which
terrifies members looking for a quick resolution of the budget battle.

LETTER bombs sent to members of Venezuela's Supreme Court over the past few
days have raised fears that the country may be facing a fresh wave of
political destabilisation, writes Joseph Mann in Caracas.
A letter bomb addressed to the Supreme Court exploded on Monday when a court
employee tried to open it. Bombs were also sent to the homes of the chief
justice and his deputy but they were defused by police. No one has claimed
responsibility.
On Monday the court was scheduled to review a decision on corruption charges
against former president Jaime Lusinchi. He condemned the letter bombs.
El Diario, the Caracas newspaper, said yesterday three other bombs were
being sought by the police.
Defence Minister Radames Munoz Leon said the devices were planted to 'create
a climate of terrorism' and impede general elections in December. Last year
the country was shaken by a series of terrorist acts supposedly carried out
by a self-styled vigilante group.

THE Mississippi threatened more towns and farmland in Illinois and Missouri
yesterday as the swollen river pushed relentlessly south, Reuter reports
from St Louis.
Prison officials in Chester, Illinois, ordered a heightened state of alert
as they planned to move inmates in low-lying cells to higher ground.
At St Genevieve, Missouri, volunteers fought to keep a sandbag levee from
crumbling. A city spokeswoman said that unless there was a surge of one inch
'we should be okay', as the crest approached the town later in the day.
The floods have caused an estimated Dollars 10bn (Pounds 6.6bn) in damage.
In Washington a congressional committee approved Dollars 3bn in emergency
aid for the flood zone yesterday as some legislators predicted Congress
might have to triple that amount eventually.
The army's Corps of Engineers said the river had not fallen much at St Louis
and would begin rising slightly again.
The floods in river valleys and rain-soaked farm fields have persisted for
more than a month in nine Midwestern states, killing as many as 31 people
and driving at least 30,000 people from their homes.
The misery spread to parts of Kansas yesterday where evacuations were under
way along the Kansas river following heavy rainfall. Officials in
Leavenworth County, north of Kansas City, warned residents that water being
released from two reservoirs farther west in the state would cause
additional flooding.
The volume of the task facing clean-up crews was becoming clearer. Crews
would face a smelly, difficult and dangerous job once the floodwaters
receded, experts on flooding said.
The overwhelming stench of spilt diesel fuel, rotting algae and animal
carcasses will hamper their effort, as will a thick layer of mud, rusting
appliances and other detritus swept up by the waters and dumped on the
flood-plain.
Petroleum products, agricultural pesticides and fertilisers, human and
animal waste and tonnes of silt have been swept into the river, along with
uprooted trees.

FT  21 JUL 93 / Puerto Rican referendum on US link pivots on economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CANUTE JAMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CAMPAIGNING is intensifying in Puerto Rico ahead of a referendum called for
mid-November to determine the future political status of the Caribbean
island, currently a US possession.
Puerto Rican leaders say the vote is intended to end several years of debate
over whether the island of 3m people should retain its 'commonwealth' link
with the US, become a state of the union, or move to political independence.
Announcement of the referendum date by Dr Pedro Rossello, the island's
governor, has intensified campaigning by the three main political parties,
which are focusing on the likely impact on the island's economy.
It is not clear, however, how US legislators in Washington, who will have
the last say on Puerto Rico's future, will treat the referendum result.
A decision by the US Congress will be affected by considerations such as
Puerto Rico's geopolitical and strategic value; the island has a large US
naval base. Puerto Rico is officially described as having a 'freely
associated' relationship with the US. Puerto Ricans are US citizens but
cannot vote for a president. The island's representation in Washington is
limited to a commissioner who has no vote to influence legislation.
The incumbent New Progressive party advocates a change in the status, with
Puerto Rico becoming a state of the union, while the opposition Popular
Democratic party is arguing for a retention of the current relationship with
the mainland.
By all indications these are the options most Puerto Ricans will consider.
There is little support for political independence, as indicated by the
Independence party's poor showing in elections.
Votes will be influenced less by political considerations than by the
public's conclusions as to which political status offers the best deal for
the economy.
The current commonwealth status has allowed the island a significant
economic advantage under Section 936 of the US Revenue Code, which
encourages mainland companies with subsidiaries in Puerto Rico to deposit
their profits in local banks.
These deposits, totalling about Dollars 15bn (Pounds 10bn), have assisted
economic growth and stability. The economy also benefits from federal
welfare funds of about Dollars 4bn a year and receives hundreds of millions
of dollars from rebates of federal excise taxes and duties collected on
exports such as rum.
Advocates of the status quo argue that Section 936 - the future of which is
being debated by legislators in Washington - will be incompatible with
statehood, and that as a state Puerto Rico would lose an incentive which has
been the pillar of the island's rapid industrialisation. They also argue
that statehood would lead the federal government, with its concerns over the
deficit, to spend more through welfare payments.
Mr Baltasar Corrado del Rio, Puerto Rico's secretary of state, agrees with
opposition claims that, as a state, Puerto Rico would be the poorest of the
union. He argues, however, that if the plebiscite supports statehood, the US
Congress would be asked to 'grandfather' Section 936 for between five and 10
years after the change, and then for the island to be declared an enterprise
zone with special tax incentives.
The vote is expected to be close, particularly if Puerto Ricans stick to
party political allegiances. In last November's gubernatorial elections the
NPP took office with 50 per cent of the vote, with 46 per cent going to the
PDP and 4 per cent to the Independence party. Political leaders say,
however, that they expect voters to cross party lines in considering
political status.
In the final reckoning the vote will have to be strong enough to convince
legislators in Washington that they should act on the result. Mr Corrado del
Rio believes that, since it is a three-way contest, the winner should be
accepted as the party which gets the most votes. Not every one is convinced
of this.
'The result will not be binding on Congress,' explained one Puerto Rican
analyst. 'Clearly, in such an important issue few congressmen will be moved
by a result which shows 51 per cent support for statehood, particularly if
there is a moderate turnout of voters. And since there are three contesting
tendencies, the chances are that the winner could get less than 50 per cent
of the vote. Washington would not take seriously such a result.'

FT  21 JUL 93 / Fall in ads for top jobs bottoms out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A FOUR-YEAR decline in the number of jobs for executives advertised in
national newspapers has bottomed out, according to figures released by the
MSL consultancy today.
For the second consecutive quarter recruitment figures stabilised, although
demand was still more than 2 1/2 times below the mid-1980s peak, the figures
show.
Mr Garry Long, MSL chief executive, said: 'The last time we saw this kind of
result was in early 1981 as that recession was ending. Three consecutive
quarters of stable results preceded the 1980s boom.'
MSL said its analysis of more than 4,000 executive jobs advertised showed
strong regional variations. There was more activity in London and the
south-east in the second quarter of this year than at any time since early
1991 - the region now accounts for 70 per cent of executive jobs advertised
in the UK.
Yorkshire and Humberside also saw increases in advertising in the second
quarter, but declines were registered elsewhere, apart from the north-west
and Scotland, which have been relatively stable.
The figures illustrated large differences between sectors. High-technology
recruitment was up 36 per cent between the first and second quarters of 1993
and 23 per cent up over the year. Retailing rose by 28 per cent and was up
10 per cent from a year previously.
Recruitment of executives in the food, drink and tobacco sector fell 9 per
cent from the previous quarter but was up 20 per cent on last year.
Energy-related industries had the largest fall over the year - down by more
than a third.
Marketing and sales had the strongest increase - up 40 per cent on the year
and 23 per cent between the first and second quarters. Accounting/ finance
and personnel had sharp rises in the first quarter, but fell in the second
by 8 per cent and 21 per cent respectively.

FT  21 JUL 93 / GM settles truck lawsuits

   DETROIT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GENERAL MOTORS has agreed to settle dozens of lawsuits by giving the owners
of some 4.7m pick-up trucks with side-mounted petrol tanks Dollars 1,000
(Pounds 666) in coupons towards the purchase of a new GM vehicle, agencies
report from Detroit.
In two separate agreements filed in a state court in Texas and a federal
court in Philadelphia, GM said it settled all the outstanding class action
lawsuits filed by owners of its 1973-1987 pick-ups.
The owners wanted to be reimbursed for resale value they said they lost
because the trucks are allegedly vulnerable to explosions in side-on
collisions.
In April the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration asked GM to
recall the pick-ups, based on a finding that the trucks were 2.4 times more
likely to catch fire in fatal side-on collisions than similar trucks built
by Ford.
GM claims, however, that the pick-ups are safe and reiterated yesterday that
it did not intend to recall the trucks.
'It does not affect the NHTSA case in any way, shape or form,' a GM official
said.
'This is not a recall. There is absolutely no modification of the vehicle.
This separates the customer satisfaction concerns from the technical
concerns.'
The Dollars 1,000 certificates are transferable within an immediate family
and cannot be sold without the truck.

FT  21 JUL 93 / OECD hits at short-term job tenures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE OECD's annual report on labour market trends, published yesterday, has
once again managed to combine objectivity and strong judgment without
causing too much offence to any of its 22 member states.
But in the case of the UK government it may have been a near-run thing.
The report's editorial has often in the past tilted towards US and UK style
labour market deregulation but this year it stresses the importance of
long-term commitments in the workplace and active labour market management.
The 1993 editorial is explicitly critical of the short job tenures
associated with 'hire and fire' labour markets and warns of the dangers of
creating too many sub-standard and insecure jobs.
It is ironic that the OECD, usually associated with a more pro-market
approach than the European Commission, should be emphasising long-term human
resource development at a time when the EC is taking a hard look at
deregulation. One economist suggested yesterday that the dismal state of the
US and UK labour markets towards the end of last year, when the report was
being drawn up, may have affected the judgments.
But the differences should not be exaggerated. The OECD report repeats many
of its long-standing criticisms of over-rigid labour markets and high
payroll taxes, especially in the EC (and southern Europe in particular)
where half of the unemployed have now been out of a job for more than a
year.
The report expects total OECD unemployment to peak in 1994 at the record
level of 36m, up from 7.9 per cent of the workforce in 1992 to 9 per cent,
and 10m above the cyclical low of 1990. OECD Europe will be even worse with
the level rising to 12 per cent or 23m people. Nevertheless, employment is
growing again in several countries including the US, Canada, Australia and
New Zealand and the report foresees OECD unemployment in other member
countries starting to fall in the second half of 1994.
The authors stress that the figures on measured unemployment should be
supplemented by the 13m OECD workers who were either 'discouraged' from
looking for work by poor job prospects or were part-time workers who wanted
to work more hours.
However, since the early 1980s there appears to have been a slow fall in the
number of discouraged workers.
That may have something to do with the gradual shift in spending on the
unemployed from passive measures, such as unemployment benefits, to active
measures such as training and placement services. Although in most countries
passive measures continue to comfortably outstrip active measures, the
proportion did shift towards active measures in 13 out of the 24 countries
between 1985 and 1990.
The report claims that there is tentative evidence to show that active
programmes have increased the relationship between job creation and output
growth and have increased wage moderation, especially in France, Sweden and
Germany.
Consistently positive results have been found for programmes in which
counselling and job search assistance have been made compulsory for people
claiming benefit. Recruitment subsidies to employers generally have positive
results, although the gains are usually less than they seem because
subsidies are often paid for workers who would have been hired anyway. Less
favourable results are reported for broadly-targeted programmes such as
training for all the unemployed.
The report also suggests that countries with a higher degree of labour
market activism have been better at combating long-term unemployment. People
out of work for more than one year account for more than 30 per cent of the
OECD unemployed. In most countries long-term unemployment is concentrated
among prime age workers but in Southern Europe the largest share is found
among youths - 15 to 24 - and in Japan and Sweden among older workers.
Long-term unemployment is associated with technological change which has
reduced the demand for unskilled labour, as witnessed by the low educational
standards of the long-term unemployed.
But the authors also conclude that 'high long-term unemployment is
associated with high dismissal costs and generous provisions regarding the
duration of unemployment benefit' and propose that both should be reviewed,
especially in the southern EC countries.
They point to the use of temporary contract work as a means of reducing
long-term joblessness and cite France and Spain where there was a large
increase in temporary work during the 1980s. In France two-fifths of the
long-term unemployed found work at the end of the 1980's through temporary
contracts and in Spain, where nearly 40 per cent of all employees are now on
temporary contracts, the figures was twice as high.

FT  21 JUL 93 / Market bully or go-ahead enterprise?: Anti-trust charges
against Microsoft
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR ALMOST three years, Microsoft, the world's largest computer software
company and the dominant supplier of programs for use on personal computers,
has been the subject of a 'non public' anti-trust investigation by the US
Federal Trade Commission.
The investigation has been far from secret, however, with several Microsoft
competitors eagerly assisting the FTC, and unnamed agency 'sources'
providing regular updates to the computer trade press.
As an extraordinarily successful company and an aggressive competitor,
Microsoft has more than its share of detractors in the software industry.
They allege that Microsoft has used nefarious tactics deliberately to
constrain competition and achieve its market leadership.
Novell, one of Microsoft's strongest competitors and the leading supplier of
personal computer networking software, has spearheaded the attack, hiring
Washington lobbyists to raise political support for anti-trust action
against Microsoft.
'Ray Noorda, Novell chairman and chief executive, is totally committed to
the case as a matter of principle,' says Wendy Goldman Rohm, author of The
FTC versus Microsoft: the Inside Story, which is to be published soon. On
Monday, she says, 'a team of Novell attorneys gave presentations to the
commissioners, hoping that they would restrict Microsoft's practices.'
In particular, Novell alleges that Microsoft's system of 'per processor'
licences for MS-DOS and Windows, its widely used PC programs, has a serious
anti-competitive effect on the software market. Microsoft offers discounts
to PC manufacturers that agree to pay a royalty fee for the right to install
MS-DOS and Windows on all the computers they sell. Novell claims that this
in effect excludes competitors such as itself.
Others in the industry charge that Microsoft uses its near monopoly in the
operating system software market to gain unfair advantage over competitors
in the market for PC applications programs.
Microsoft says it is legally constrained from commenting directly on the
FTC's deliberations, but has denied wrong-doing and continues to co-operate
with the investigation.
In February, an FTC vote deadlocked, two for and two against, on whether to
seek a court injunction against Microsoft. Today the commission will
consider a revised and much narrower case against Microsoft. It is believed
to focus upon alleged abuse of product warranties to tie customers'
guarantees to use of other Microsoft programs, as well as allegations that
Microsoft deliberately and falsely gave users of test versions of Windows
the impression that the program would not work properly with competing PC
operating systems such as Novell's DR-DOS.
Whatever decision the commission reaches today, it is not expected to have
an immediate impact upon Microsoft's business. The Commission will not seek
'structural changes,' such as breaking up the company, Ms Goldman Rohm
predicts. Nonetheless, the case could have a broad impact on the computer
software industry by forcing Microsoft to be more restrained in its
competitive tactics, providing other companies with an opportunity to unseat
the industry leader.
Microsoft has sold about 30m copies of Windows since its launch three years
ago and about 100m copies of MS-DOS over the past 12 years. Net income for
fiscal year 1992, ending June 1992, was Dollars 708m (Pounds 472m) on
revenues of Dollars 2.8bn.
If the FTC votes to seek an injunction against Microsoft, it could simply
consent and avoid a trial. Were Microsoft to fight the case, it runs the
risk of becoming embroiled in a legal battle that could last years,
reminiscent of International Business Machines' battles with the Justice
Department.
The Microsoft case is also being closely watched for clues about the Clinton
administration's stand on anti-trust law enforcement after 12 years of
Republican rule in the White House during which a 'let the market decide'
philosophy toward non-merger anti-trust cases prevailed.
Should the FTC again reach deadlock over whether to carry the Microsoft case
forward, the US justice department is poised to take over the case,
according to Ms Goldman Rohm.
For Microsoft, win or lose, the message is that as a big and successful
company, it needs to be aware of the anti-trust implications of its business
practices.
So far, however, Microsoft has been reluctant to accept such constraints,
which it believes could be damaging to its competitiveness.
While other software companies characterise Microsoft as a bully, Microsoft
itself is still battling to stay ahead.

FT  21 JUL 93 / Consumer confidence in Japan shows decline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOUSEHOLD spending in Japan fell 1.8 per cent in May from a year earlier,
the first decline in three months and a sign of the weakening consumer
confidence that threatens to delay a recovery expected later this year.
The fall in most areas of consumer spending is likely to intensify debate on
income tax cuts, but the post-election confusion will make
politically-sensitive decisions even more difficult, including a stimulatory
package demanded by business leaders.
Management and Co-ordination Agency officials said housing-related spending
was 10.1 per cent lower in May, while education spending slipped 4.7 per
cent and furniture and other household expenditure fell 3.9 per cent.
The agency also reported that disposable income during the month was 4.7 per
cent lower than a year earlier, reflecting the impact of reduced overtime
and an increase in unemployment, both of which are undermining consumer
confidence.
There is also growing concern among government economists that the
continuing political instability could prompt consumers to be even more
selective in their spending in coming months. The US has asked that Japan
stimulate demand to increase imports and reduce the trade surplus.
An index of leading indicators compiled by the Economic Planning Agency fell
to 30 per cent in May from 63.6 per cent in April, below 50 per cent, the
so-called boom-bust line, for the first time in four months.
The fall in the index was attributed partly to a decline in shipments of
manufacturing goods, which had risen in March and April in expectation of an
increase in demand that did not materialise.

FT  21 JUL 93 / N Korea-US nuclear accord hailed by Seoul: Many obstacles
remain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BURTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOUTH KOREA said yesterday that the results of the US-North Korea talks in
Geneva represented 'major progress toward the resolution of the North Korean
nuclear issue'.
Officials in Seoul said the talks produced what amounted to a framework
agreement to dispel suspicions about Pyongyang's nuclear programme.
Although many obstacles remain before talks are completed, the ultimate goal
appears to be an improvement in US-North Korean relations in exchange for
Pyongyang's acceptance of full nuclear inspections.
North Korea has been seeking expanded ties with the US to break its
diplomatic isolation and encourage foreign investment that is needed to save
its troubled economy.
Pyongyang agreed in Geneva to begin talks with the International Atomic
Energy Agency (IAEA) on complete inspections of its nuclear facilities.
North Korea last year allowed the IAEA to conduct regular scheduled
inspections of declared facilities at the Yongbyon nuclear complex, but
barred access to two unreported nuclear waste sites. The IAEA wanted to
examine the sites to determine if North Korea is reprocessing more plutonium
than it has disclosed.
The 'special inspections' of the sites demanded by the IAEA prompted the
country in March to threaten to leave the nuclear non-proliferation treaty.
Pyongyang accused the IAEA of not being impartial in its demand for the
special inspections, the first time it had requested them.
South Korean officials suggest that the IAEA may withdraw its demand for
special inspections in a face-saving gesture if North Korea allows the
agency access to the two facilities under another form of inspection.
North Korea also promised to resume talks with South Korea on mutual nuclear
inspections as stipulated in their 1991 non-nuclear pact.
If progress is made in Pyongyang's talks with the IAEA and South Korea, the
US will hold more talks to discuss improving ties with North Korea within
two months.
One initial step in developing ties would be US assistance in replacing
North Korea's graphite moderated reactors with light water reactors, which
are safer, easier to inspect and depend on imported enriched uranium for
fuel. North Korea has two small reactors at Yongbyon and is building two
bigger units there which are scheduled for completion by 1996.
One reason the north adopted gas-cooled reactor technology from the former
Soviet Union was that it uses natural uranium for fuel. This is produced in
North Korea, making it difficult to determine how much uranium the country
has consumed and reprocessed as plutonium.
Reliance on nuclear power would ease North Korea's energy shortage caused by
cessation of oil shipments from the former Soviet Union.
Pyongyang has tried to cover the shortage by selling Scud missiles to Iran
for oil.
However, South Korean officials cautioned that even if the US agrees to
provide Pyongyang with light water reactor technology, it would not
immediately solve North Korea's energy shortage.
The US is also demanding other concessions from North Korea in return for
improved relations, including ending human rights abuses, renouncing
terrorism and stopping the sale of Scud missiles to the Middle East.
Seoul is also offering to permit business contacts if progress is made in
the inter-Korean talks on the nuclear problem and other issues.

A TOP AIDE to Russia's security minister said yesterday that Russian forces
in Tajikistan reserved the right to launch attacks across the Afghan border
and that 'we have the moral right to invade their territory'.
General Vladimir Bondarenko, the security minister's chief of staff, echoed
the tough line taken last week by the military establishment after 25
Russian border guards were killed in a raid launched by Tajik opposition
fighters who had taken refuge in Afghanistan after losing the struggle for
control of their republic.
Tajik and Russian officials have accused the government in Kabul of
masterminding the attack, a charge the Afghan leadership has denied.
Russian legislators, back from a trip to the embattled border region,
admitted yesterday that Russian forces were behind a retaliatory attack into
Afghan territory last week in which 380 people were killed or wounded and
6,000 villagers forced to flee their homes.
Gen Bondarenko said yesterday that the security ministry had authorised its
troops to fire into Afghanistan.

FT  21 JUL 93 / Sanctions threat to China over missiles
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Clinton administration, which two months ago renewed favourable trade
benefits for China, has threatened to impose economic sanctions on Beijing
if it ships missiles to Pakistan in defiance of an international agreement,
Agencies report from Washington.
The issue - following strong evidence that China is shipping M-11 missile
technology to Pakistan - will be raised by Mr Warren Christopher, US
secretary of state, when he meets his Chinese counterpart, Mr Qian Qichen,
on Sunday in Singapore. Ms Lynn Davis, undersecretary of state and the
Clinton administration's chief arms negotiator, will also discuss the matter
in Beijing.
The 'effect of applicable US law would be made clear to China and that
includes the likelihood of sanctions under certain circumstances,' a State
Department spokesman said. He added that sanctions would be imposed once it
was determined that 'certain transshipments of items have occurred, and to
my knowledge we have not determined that'.
The US has been concerned about China's M-11 missile sales to Pakistan for
several years, arguing they violate the missile technology control regime
designed to stem the spread of ballistic missiles. China has said it
supplied short-range missiles to Pakistan without exceeding MTCR.

FT  21 JUL 93 / UK earnings inequality increases
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK saw the biggest increase in earnings inequality of any OECD country
in the 1980s but remains considerably less unequal than the US and at about
the same level as France, according to an analysis in the organisation's
Employment Outlook, writes David Goodhart.
The 1980s saw earnings inequality rise in 12 out of the 17 countries for
which data were available in marked contrast to the 1970s where inequality
generally fell (with the exception of the US).
Small rises in inequality were recorded in Australia, Austria, Belgium,
Canada, Finland, France, Japan, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, and
Sweden. Large increases were recorded in the UK and the US. Levels of
inequality remained stable in Denmark, Finland, Italy and Norway and
inequality continued to fall in west Germany.
The OECD says the growing gap can be ascribed to highly-paid workers doing
better than average rather than to poorly paid workers doing worse.
Australia, Canada and the US were the only countries seeing falls in the
real value of the bottom earnings decline.

FT  21 JUL 93 / Riot police sent to end Hyundai dispute: Seoul's tough
stance on industrial unrest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BURTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE South Korean government yesterday demanded that workers at Hyundai Motor
suspend their industrial action immediately and sent riot police to enforce
the order.
The swift intervention is meant to end the 46 days of labour strife that has
disrupted South Korea's biggest industrial conglomerate.
Hyundai Motor is the largest of the nine Hyundai companies still affected by
stoppages that began in early June. Hyundai estimates that it has lost
Won390bn (Pounds 326m) in sales as a result of the partial strikes at the
country's leading vehicle maker. This accounts for two-thirds of total
losses in turnover suffered by Hyundai during the dispute, while total
production losses amount to Won1,230bn, including business lost by 2,500
subcontractors mostly affiliated with Hyundai Motor.
In targeting Hyundai Motor, the government hopes to persuade workers at the
other striking Hyundai companies to settle their dispute over pay and
working conditions and return to work.
The government invoked its emergency powers to intervene because it fears
that the continuing labour conflict could affect Korea's economic recovery
by reducing exports. Officials estimate that the country has already lost
almost Won250bn in exports, mainly motor vehicles, due to the strike.
Although Hyundai Motor workers had resumed normal schedules late last week
in a conciliatory gesture to management, they threatened to resume partial
strikes today and stage a general strike on Friday if no progress was
achieved in negotiations.
Hyundai Motor workers are now barred from staging any form of industrial
action until August 8, while the government mediates in the dispute,
possibly imposing a settlement.
As many as 10,000 police are being deployed to Ulsan - the south-eastern
city where Hyundai Motor and the other Hyundai companies are located - to
suppress any strike activity.
A clash between workers and riot police would be highly embarrassing for the
new democratic government of Mr Kim Young-sam, who promised labour reforms
when he took office five months ago. The use of emergency powers already
represents a setback for the government's labour policy, which was based on
negotiations between labour and management without any government
interference.
It is only the second time the government has resorted to using emergency
powers to end a labour dispute, the first having occurred in 1969. But
police were frequently used to suppress strikes during the military
dictatorship in the 1970s and 1980s.

A TOP AIDE to Russia's security minister said yesterday that Russian forces
in Tajikistan reserved the right to launch attacks across the Afghan border
and that 'we have the moral right to invade their territory'.
General Vladimir Bondarenko, the security minister's chief of staff, echoed
the tough line taken last week by the Russian military establishment after
25 Russian border guards were killed on July 13 in a raid launched by Tajik
opposition fighters who had taken refuge in Afghanistan after losing the
struggle for control of their republic.
Tajik and Russian officials have accused the fissiparous coalition
government in Kabul of masterminding the attack, a charge the Afghan
leadership has denied.
Russian legislators, back from a trip to the embattled border region,
admitted yesterday that Russian forces were behind a retaliatory attack into
Afghan territory last week in which 380 people were killed or wounded and
6,000 villagers forced to flee their homes.
Gen Bondarenko said yesterday that the security ministry, the body
responsible for the border forces, had authorised its troops to fire into
Afghanistan.
'The border guards have received an order to use fire to prevent any
concentration of the enemy, even across the border, into Afghanistan,' he
said at a press conference.
'I think they also should have the right to raid Afghan territory,' Gen
Bondarenko added, but said the order for such attacks had not been given.
Russian leaders and opinion makers are split on how to their country should
react to the bloody conflict on the Afghan border.
Hard-line communists and nationalists, accusing the military of 'criminal
wavering,' believe its reaction has not been tough enough, but the foreign
ministry, wary of becoming involved in an unwinnable guerrilla war, is
adopting a moderate stance.

MR Kiichi Miyazawa, Japan's prime minister, appeared ready yesterday to bow
to demands within the Liberal Democratic party for him to resign to take
responsibility for the party's loss of its parliamentary majority.
The LDP leader came under increased pressure after the resignation of Mr
Junichiro Koizumi, the posts and telecommunications minister, who said Mr
Miyazawa 'should have resigned right after our defeat in the election' on
Sunday.
Mr Miyazawa, 73, has generally been vague in replying to the party's demands
in the hope of maintaining power, but indicated that he is likely to resign
at a party meeting tomorrow at which other LDP executives are expected to be
replaced.
Reputedly a reformer, Mr Koizumi presented his resignation as an honourable
political act, yet he is a member of a rival LDP faction headed by the
openly ambitious Mr Hiroshi Mitsuzuka, who wants the party leadership.
The new leader will be the LDP candidate for prime minister at an
extraordinary session of parliament early next month.
Rival faction leaders claim that Mr Miyazawa must resign in the 'interests
of party unity and stability,' but these faction heads are also under attack
from younger party members for their role in the party split that led to the
election and the end of one-party rule in Japan.
The LDP must find a partner to be certain that its candidate will be chosen
as prime minister at the extraordinary session, likely to be held on August
2.
The resignation of Mr Miyazawa will be cited as evidence to potential
partners that the party is in favour of political reform.
However, Mr Miyazawa showed more interest in reforming the scandal-stained
political system than did the rival factions demanding his head. It will be
difficult for one of the newer pro-reform parties to agree to a coalition
with the LDP if Mr Mitsuzuka, or a senior member of his conservative
faction, takes the helm.

FT  21 JUL 93 / World Trade News: Multinationals take lead as world economic
force - Unctad's World Investment Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OVERSEAS investment by multinationals has become a bigger force in the world
economy than world trade, according to a report from the United Nations. In
1992, sales generated by multinationals outside their country of origin
totalled Dollars 5.5trillion (million million), compared with total world
exports of Dollars 4trillion.
Transnational corporations (TNCs) now control a third of the world's private
sector productive assets. The stock of foreign investment worldwide totals
Dollars 2trillion. In national terms, the biggest owners are the US with
Dollars 474bn and the UK with Dollars 259bn. Japan is catching up fast with
Dollars 251bn.
Growth in foreign direct investment is set to take off again after a period
of decline, according to the report. In particular, investment in the
developing world could double in real terms by the year 2000 from Dollars
40bn last year.
Total investment fell in 1992 for the second year running, from Dollars
183bn to Dollars 150bn, compared with a peak figure in 1990 of Dollars
234bn. But inflows to the developing world carried on rising, while those to
the developed world fell sharply.
The latest decline follows a period of growth well above average. During the
past two decades, the average annual rise in investment was 13 per cent. In
the period 1986-90 the average was 28 per cent. The report attributes this
to the economic boom of the late 1980s and a consequent wave of mergers and
acquisitions, and to one-off policy changes such as the announcement of the
EC single market.
The underlying trend is still upward, the UN says. There is continuing
liberalisation in policies towards foreign investment, especially in
services such as telecommunications, transportation, utilities and
insurance.
In addition, the report argues, 'international production has become a
central structural characteristic of the world economy'. This is partly a
result of the revolution in communications, which allows companies to
integrate more fully with their overseas subsidiaries. Assuming trade
liberalisation continues, companies will still have the incentive to locate
production in low-cost countries from which they can export.
The report points to privatisation as helping the trend. From the mid-1960s
to the early 1970s, it says, many developing countries expropriated
multinationals' assets in the belief that control was the key to economic
independence. From the mid-1970s, inward investment came to be seen as the
way to attract foreign capital and technology. Multinationals have been
particularly involved in privatisation in Latin America and eastern Europe.
However, the report warns the trend could reverse again if economic growth
remains weak, technology transfer proves disappointing or world markets are
closed through protectionism.
By the early 1990s the world total of transnational corporations had reached
37,000, with more than 170,000 foreign affiliates. Because of non-equity
arrangements such as franchising and licensing, this is claimed to
underestimate their true influence.
More than 90 per cent of TNCs have their headquarters in the developed
world. Almost 60 per cent of all parent companies are in manufacturing, 37
per cent in services and 3 per cent in the primary sector. There is an
increasing concentration of investment in services and technology-intensive
manufacturing, with a declining share in the primary sector and
resource-based manufacturing.
Ownership of foreign assets is highly concentrated, with half the total
owned by just 1 per cent of the companies. The world's biggest transnational
corporation, by size of overseas assets, is Royal Dutch Shell. Next come
Ford, GM, Exxon and IBM. Of the top 20, seven are US, three Japanese, two
German, two Anglo-Dutch and two Swiss, with one each from the UK, the
Netherlands, Italy and France. The list does not include financial
corporations.
Investment in developing countries continues to show a clustering pattern.
However, it is crossing regions more.
The strategies of TNCs are fostering world-wide economic integration, the
report says. Companies are locating central functions in whichever country
is most cheap or efficient. Swissair handles all its revenue accounting from
Bombay, for example.
The report argues that such activities cause integration between countries
even in the absence of formal agreements such as the EC single market. Asian
economies have been more closely integrated by the production strategies of
Japanese companies, while US companies were establishing links with Mexico
before the negotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement.
'The traditional division between integration at the corporate and country
levels begins to break down. TNCs . . . encroach on areas over which
sovereignty and responsibilities have traditionally been reserved for
national governments.'

FT  21 JUL 93 / World Trade News: UK seeks bigger US airline stakes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK has called on the US to allow foreign airlines to take larger stakes
in US carriers.
In evidence given to President Bill Clinton's emergency government
commission on the US airline industry, the UK government also defended
British Airways against accusations by US carriers that it was too dominant
at the world's busiest international airport, London's Heathrow.
Britain is keen to present a strong case to the Commission which it believes
will influence talks already under way between London and Washington over
reforming the rules on passenger traffic between the two countries.
Earlier this week, the commission recommended tentatively that foreign
airlines be allowed to own up to 49 per cent of the voting stock of US
carriers. The current limit is 25 per cent. Its final report is to be
published next month.
The UK argued that US airlines have unfair access to the US domestic market.
Most transatlantic passengers starting or ending in cities not served by UK
carriers spent their entire journey on US carriers. 'Foreign airlines are
effectively being denied access to one third of transatlantic traffic,
approximately 3m of the 9m transatlantic passengers,' said the UK. This was
'a cause for concern'.
The UK argued that BA's share of Heathrow business, at 38 per cent, was far
less than most US carriers had at their main hub airports.
The arguments are unlikely to sway US Department of Transportation
officials. They have signalled their determination to win concessions from
the UK government on US airlines' access to UK airports, especially
Heathrow.
Representatives from the US Department of Transportation and their UK
counterparts will meet next week in London in the latest round of talks. The
two transport ministers have set a deadline of April 1994 to agree on a new
package.

FT  21 JUL 93 / World Trade News: BAe chief warns of obstacles to joint
venture with Taiwan
</HEADLINE>

OBSTACLES still remain in the way of the proposed Pounds 250m joint venture
between British Aerospace and Taiwan Aerospace Corporation (TAC), said Mr
John Cahill, BAe's chairman, yesterday. He warned that the deal must be
completed by July 31.
The plan to transfer production of BAe's regional jet (RJ) airliners to the
joint venture is fundamental to the restructuring and recovery of BAe's
loss-making civil aircraft business.
The deadline for the final conclusion of the venture had already been
postponed twice, said Mr Cahill. 'We have a mandate (from BAe's board of
directors) which expires at the end of July. I doubt very much that it could
be extended beyond the end of July.'
Mr Cahill said he nevertheless expected soon to 'receive the necessary
written assurances from the Taiwan government and financial institutions to
enable this joint venture to go ahead.'
He said one obstacle was that a plan to create a company for leasing the
aircraft was still not finalised.
A consortium of Taiwan banks have been asked to provide Dollars 400m (Pounds
267m) to finance the leasing company and Dollars 60m in working capital.
But the group, led by the Chiao Tung Bank, the state development bank, have
questioned the market outlook for the RJ and the risks involved in the
leasing operation.
Mr Cahill argued that the BAe executives had assured the local banking
community that 'leasing is a good business for banks to be in. It's a
profitable business.'
Mr Cahill also said TAC 'needs the support of the banks for a relatively
short space of time. Within two or three years, they will have established
their credibility as a good, sound, solid company and they can then borrow
on their own assets and reputation just as BAe can.'
Mr Charles Masfield, president of BAe's regional jet unit, said: 'Avro will
be profitable in its first year of trading.'
The reason for the link with TAC was to 'ensure maximum penetration' into
the rapidly growing Asia/Pacific market for aircraft with 'a partner with
full production capability, design, engineering and support capabilities,'
said Mr Masfield.
'By producing aircraft or significant portions of aircraft in this region,
we will be able to produce lower cost aircraft and be able to sell the
aircraft at lower prices, even with the profits Avro will be making.'
Mr Cahill said mainland China would be a big market for the aircraft, as
airline traffic in China was 'growing at about 30 per cent a year'.
BAe had been selling regional aircraft to China for 40 years and had already
sold 18 BAC-146 regional jet aircraft to mainland Chinese users.
He added: 'The size, payload and capabilities of this aircraft (the RJ) will
make it more suited to the PRC (People's Republic of China) market as
China's west opens up.'
Mr Masfield said BAe would be 'very disappointed if we don't sell more than
100 regional jets into the PRC'.
He did not set a time frame for the figure, although BAe anticipates
production of RJ and RJ-X aircraft to reach 382 by 2000 and 1,157 by 2011.
The size of the broader mainland China-Taiwan market will also be increased
by sales to Taiwan-based airlines flying to the mainland when direct air
links are estab lished.
Mr Cahill met officials of Taiwan's Ministry of Economic Affairs, the Chiao
Tung Bank, and legislators from both the ruling Kuomintang and opposition
Democratic Progressive party during his two-day visit.

SKODA Koncern Plzen, the Czech republic's largest engineering combine, is on
the verge of finalising a joint venture with the German company Siemens to
manufacture steam turbines. The deal ends two years of uncertainty over the
future of Skoda Plzen's turbine division.
Mr Lubomir Soudek, Skoda Plzen's chairman, indicated last week that he had
given the Siemens team until the end of this week to agree to five main
conditions. An official has confirmed that arrangements for the signing of
the memorandum of understanding will be made this week.
Discussions with Siemens relating to a transportation joint venture are not
being pursued. Skoda Plzen already has joint ventures with Brown &amp; Root, and
Dorries Scharmann and Secheron, and is separate from Skoda Auto, the car
maker now owned by Volkswagen.
The company is undergoing internal restructuring which has involved cutting
the number of employees from 38,000 to 21,000. All 34 divisions had to show
plans last month, the first time management had seen a breakdown of basic
input costs like power consumption. New investment areas include
eco-technology such as incinerators and nuclear waste fuel containers.
A subsidiary is discussing with an American company plans to develop its
prototype electric car. Skoda Plzen has also teamed up with Alcatel Alsthom
to bid for a metro contract in Prague.
In addition Skoda Plzen has signed a preliminary agreement with a Russian
partner and is lobbying the Czech government to sell its inter-government
discounted debt to finance the project. Skoda Plzen has also brought
together a consortium of 12 Czech companies to produce arms to modernise the
Czech and other east bloc armies.
Mr Soudek, who was appointed managing director by the first post-revolution
government and then sacked, was reappointed last autumn to turn the company
around. His approach to the company's restructuring problems is to strike
hard deals and look again at traditional markets like Russia, China and
India.
After falling into crisis last autumn, the company is owed Csk5.6bn (Pounds
127m) by other companies, equivalent to more than half last year's
production, plus Csk1.3bn by the Czech government for 60 locomotives the
state railway no longer wants.

FT  21 JUL 93 / World Trade News: Malaysia urged to boost Gatt role
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MALAYSIA's rapid economic growth over the past two decades owes much to
expansion of its international trade, making it a major beneficiary of the
liberal world trade regime, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade says
in a report published yesterday
Malaysia, which has a population of just 18m, has transformed itself from a
commodity producer to an important manufacturing centre. Exports and imports
each now account for almost 80 per cent of GDP from under 50 per cent in the
1960s, and Malaysia has become the 16th largest trader in Gatt.
In the light of Malaysia's increased weight in international trade, 'it
would be proper for Malaysia to consider fuller integration into the Gatt
system and to assume more responsibility in it', the report says.
It notes, among other things, that Malaysia has 'bound' (agreed not to
raise) only 1 per cent of tariff lines in Gatt, and has joined only one of
Gatt's nine voluntary codes of trade practice. While tariffs average only
about 15 per cent, certain 'strategic' sectors such as car production are
protected by high tariff and non-tariff barriers.
In general, however, Gatt members who discussed the secretariat's report
this week were full of praise for Malaysia's achievement. Real GDP growth
has averaged about 6 per cent in the 1980s and just under 9 per cent in the
early 1990s. Per capita incomes have risen by nearly 7 per cent a year to
Dollars 3,100 (Pounds 2,067) in 1992, putting the country well on the path
to its stated objective of developed country status by the year 2020.
Foreign investment has played a big part in these developments. Since 1967,
the report notes, 60 per cent of manufacturing investment has been based on
foreign capital, largely directed to export production. The share of
manufactures in total exports has risen from about 22 per cent in 1980 to 69
per cent in 1992.
Malaysia has become the world's largest exporter of room air conditioners
and ranks among the top three exporters of semiconductors. Electronics,
textiles and rubber-based products account for over 70 per cent of
manufactured exports.
In commodities, Malaysia accounts for about one half of world timber
exports, is the world's biggest producer of palm oil and has significant
sales of crude petroleum, rubber and tin.
The report also draws attention to the fact that, in recent years, there has
been a shift in Malaysia's trade policies towards closer integration within
the Association of South-East Nations, comprising Brunei, Indonesia,
Malaysia, Philippines, Thailand and Singapore.
The Asean Preferential Trading Agreement, signed in 1977, provides for
preferential margins of between 25 and 50 per cent on imports originating in
members states. At the beginning of 1992, Asean members agreed on a Common
Effective Preferential Tariff Scheme with the aim of achieving an Asean free
trade area within 15 years from the beginning of this year.

FT  21 JUL 93 / World Trade News: An open door alone is not enough to
attract cash - Unctad's World Investment Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS multinationals integrate their global operations, and account for an
increasing share of world trade and investment, they present new challenges
for policy makers.
Liberalisation may no longer be enough to capture a share of international
investment capital, the World Investment Report says. More pro-active
measures are needed. While it challenges the value of tax holidays and other
fiscal incentives, it calls on governments to 'play an active role in
improving their economies as locations for foreign investment'.
Noting that 90 per cent of foreign direct investment goes to industrial
countries, and that a further 8 per cent goes to just 10 countries in Asia
and Latin America, it says the potential 'is considerable' for developing
countries to capture increasing investment flows over the decade ahead - as
long as appropriate policies are adopted.
'Modern financial services, telecommunications, transport and utilities are
essential for developing countries, not only to bolster the efficiency of
the wider economy and improve the competitiveness of the export sector, but
to insert themselves into the system of integrated international
production,' it says.
Noting that an efficient private sector 'is unlikely without an efficient
public sector', it calls for public institutions to be 'restructured
according to modern organisational and management practices'.
The complex integrated relationships between parents and affiliates across
the world are challenging nationally-based legal control. This raises the
question of whether such multinationals should be treated differently from
domestic companies as well as making it steadily harder to pinpoint where
legal responsibilities lay and where tax should be paid.
The reason liberalisation alone is no longer enough is that an increasingly
large number of developing countries have opened their economies in similar
ways. Governments keen to attract foreign investment 'should go beyond
general, broad based efforts and focus on particular functions (eg regional
headquarters, research and development, accounting) for which they believe
they have certain advantages'.
Also countries must:
Care less about ownership structure of a multinational based inside their
borders, and more about attracting investment in the first place: 'It is
more important to host technology than to own it.'
Market themselves attractively. Focus on service industries, as these will
account for an increasing share of foreign investment flows in the decade
ahead.
Develop policies to encourage small and medium-sized domestic industries, as
such policies can attract investment from the increasingly numerous small
and medium-sized transnational corporations.
Cut transaction and 'hassle' costs while minimising the risk and uncertainty
many foreign investors feel when entering a new market.
Ensure assistance is available to foreign investors after approval has been
given for an investment. Protect intellectual property, seek help from
nationals living overseas, and consider export processing zones, 'some of
which have been quite successful'.
'International production is increasingly determined by factors that go
beyond cheap labour, and depend on overall national competitiveness.'
It challenges strongly the use of fiscal incentives such as tax holidays:
'An incentive competition between governments is very costly, particularly
for developing countries, and can generate inefficient investments with
disappointing results. If it goes too far, not even the 'winning' country
obtains a net benefit.'
It nevertheless concedes that incentives have been effective in influencing
the direction of investment. It refers to a recent World Bank study in which
two-thirds of 74 cases showed the final decision on where to invest was
influenced by incentives.
The report calls for international co-operation - through the Organisation
for Economic Co-operation and Development or the UN - to negotiate
incentives down: 'International harmonisation of incentives is a difficult
thing. But given their limited effectiveness, their tendency to distort
investment, trade flows and the danger of an incentives war, a concerted
effort in this area would be desirable.'
Examining the increasing problems linked with pin-pointing the 'legal
personality' of a multinational, it recommends international co-operation in
areas such as competition policy, disclosure of corporate information,
common accounting principles, and regulations for environmental protection.
Co-operation is also urgently required on the issue of taxing
multinationals, and answering questions such as where taxable income is
earned, how it is distributed across different countries in the production
chain, and how taxes should be allocated.
The issue has been highlighted in the US, where California is challenging
conventional 'arm's length' international tax practices by insisting it can
tax multinationals operating there by calculating a sum based on the staff
employed in the state, the investment made, and the value of output, as a
proportion of the TNC's global activities.
The UN report is sympathetic to such a 'unitary tax', but warns of
complications because such a tax assumes profit is spread uniformly across
all stages of an integrated production system and does not take into account
that production costs vary from country to country.
It calls again for international co-operation as the only solution to these
problems.

FT  21 JUL 93 / World Trade News: Mexico pressed to move against Canadian
wheat
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US Republican leader, Senator Robert Dole, and Senator Max Baucus,
chairman of the Senate trade sub-committee, are putting pressure on Mexican
President Carlos Salinas to bring a countervailing duty case against 'unfair
Canadian wheat subsidies'.
In a letter to President Salinas last week, the two senators linked the
president's response to their support of the North American Free Trade
Agreement. Bringing a CVD case 'would indicate a strong desire to guarantee
that the Nafta will provide continent-wide trade, free of export subsidies,'
they said. 'Failure to address this problem jeopardises the support for the
Nafta among wheat producers and their congressional representatives.'
They said a CVD case has the strong support of Mexican wheat farmers, who
might otherwise get caught in a price-cutting trade war between US and
Canada, 'placing them in a position where they could not compete with the
resulting lower prices'.
A Mexican trade analyst said complaining to the president is 'not the
appropriate channel. . . it is for the Mexican farmers to go to the Ministry
of Commerce.' If Nafta is approved, there would be a mechanism to address
this kind of complaint, he said.
US lawmakers have been furious that Canada has dominated the Mexican wheat
market for the past three years and insist it is due to subsidies by the
Canadian Wheat Board.

<TEXT>
A SERB offensive was reported to be closing in on Sarajevo yesterday and
fighting between Moslems and Croats raged in central Bosnia, Reuter reports
from Sarajevo. This was the backdrop to a new EC peace mission as Mr Willy
Claes, Belgian foreign minister, arrived to try to bring the warring parties
to the negotiating table.
He warned Serbs and Croats: 'If they do not follow the rules of the game,
they must expect a reinforcement of sanctions and even the use of methods
that up to now we have refused to use.'
Belgrade-based Tanjug news agency said Serb forces had taken the
southwestern part of Mount Igman, a stronghold of the Moslem-led government
army overlooking the Sarajevo and now under heavy attack.
In central Bosnia, heavy fighting was reported between government forces and
both Serbs and Croats. The two towns of Bugojno and Maglaj came under
intense bombardment.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees is making a direct appeal
to the public of several countries including Britain, the US and Italy to
help make up an estimated Dollars 100m shortfall in this year's Dollars 420m
budget, writes Mark Suzman in London.

FT  21 JUL 93 / VW to face more scrutiny in secrets dispute
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE latest twist yesterday in Germany's industrial secrets row indicates
that Volkswagen is set to face increasing pressure on a number of issues
relating to its appointment of Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua as a
director.
Speculation is mounting that, as an early development, state prosecutors
investigating possible criminal charges will make a formal statement later
this week on inquiries so far.
The decision by a Hamburg civil court to loosen reporting restrictions
imposed last month on Der Spiegel, Germany's leading news weekly, will
re-open the public debate on claims by General Motors of the US and its
German subsidiary, Adam Opel, that Mr Lopez, a former GM director, and
several of his associates who joined VW with him, took industrial secrets
with them to the German group.
After yesterday's ruling, which followed an open hearing last Thursday, the
magazine can resume reporting on its earlier claims that Mr Lopez took boxes
of secrets with him when he quit GM in March.
It may also pursue its charges that Mr Jose Manuel Gutierrez, a close
associate of Mr Lopez who followed his former GM chief to VW almost
immediately, asked for and was given 'strictly confidential' details of a
new GM diesel engine.
The court, which imposed a gagging order at VW's request last month after
the publication of two detailed articles, also lifted the injunction in
regard to a claim that Mr Lopez had 'reached an agreement' to join VW with
Mr Ferdinand Piech, at the start of this year.
In an affidavit presented in court last week, and signed by Mr Piech, the VW
chairman stated that Mr Lopez decided to move on March 9.
The court also received testimony that Mr Lopez had in effect written a
speech, intended to explain to GM employees why he had decided not to join
VW, which was not in the event delivered. After checking the final draft on
the morning of March 15, he left the US for Germany.
Mr Lopez stated in an affidavit presented last Thursday that he did not
write it, and that it had been written by 'GM'.
Mr Lopez and VW were represented at the hearing by a single lawyer while Der
Spiegel had more than 20 witnesses, all GM employees, on hand to support its
case. although only three were called.
All the claims on which the court loosened the gag yesterday have been
firmly and consistently denied by VW and its executives, although as Mr
Harald Ficus, presiding judge, said last week, his court was not the place
for deciding the truth or otherwise of the suspicions aired in Der Spiegel.
However, Volkswagen was obliged to bear most of the costs of the case.
In German courts apportionment of costs shows the extent to which the
parties involved have gained or lost, according to legal experts.
On the single issue of Der Spiegel's reports on the diesel engine secrets,
Mr Gutierrez was made responsible for the whole DM100,000 (Pounds 38,759) in
costs.
In another case, which concerned complaints made in the German group's name
 -including Mr Piech's claims on the planning and timing of Mr Lopez's
switch - VW was obliged to pay two-thirds of the DM500,000 costs.

FT  21 JUL 93 / Cagliari's death casts shadow over inquiry: Concern about
the abuse of power in probe of corruption
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DEATH in prison yesterday of Mr Gabriele Cagliari, former chairman of
ENI, the Italian state oil concern, has brought to a head the long-simmering
debate over the methods of magistrates investigating the natiowide
corruption scandals.
Immediately at issue is the abusive use of the magistrates' powers of
preventive detention that conflicts with the basic right of habeas corpus.
The matter was raised by President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro in a controversial
speech on July 8 when he expressed his doubts about the behaviour of
magistrates: 'There is no doubt that the use of prison to make talk someone
under investigation is against the inviolable rights of man.'
The bulk of the politicians and a few jurists immediately sided with the
president. The press was largely neutral, and may well remain so now, aware
the latest opinion poll shows the public is 57 per cent behind the judges on
preventive detention, with 34 per cent against.
But Mr Cagliari's apparent suicide, the ninth since the corruption
investigations began in February 1992, inevitably raises two broader
questions: has the judiciary accumulated too much power?; and has it become
too politicised in seeking to extirpate a corrupt political system?
The handling of this controversy will determine the future course of the
corruption investigations and could well produce a constitutional tussle
between the respective powers of the legislature and judiciary.
Parliament, where one in six members are under investigation, will do its
best to exploit the occasion by trying to the shackle the magistrates'
behaviour with more restrictive legislation. New legislation limiting the
terms of preventive detention is already in the pipeline. The Milan
magistrates, confident of public support, are unlikely to take lying down
any challenge to their authority, or any suggestion that their
investigations be tempered.
However, the Italian magistrature as a whole is not as combative as that of
Milan, which has spearheaded the corruption investigations and has been
using the most questionable methods.
The case of Mr Cagliari is an apparent suicide after being held in Milan's
San Vittore jail for 133 days. Latterly the 67-year-old former ENI chairman
shared a cell with three others, including a drug offender.
Magistrates can hold a person for up to three months. Thereafter the person
has to be released unless due cause is shown by the magistrates. On five
occasions, the last being only three days ago, Mr Cagliari was refused bail
while magistrates investigated a string of charges relating to illicit
financing of political parties when he ran ENI from 1989 onwards.
On each occasion, Milan magistrates justified the refusal on the grounds
that their enquiries concerned large sums of money lodged abroad. If allowed
to leave prison for house arrest, Mr Cagliari could prejudice matters, they
said.
The Milan magistrates argued convincingly that ENI had emerged as the centre
of the biggest single source of illicit financing of the political parties
and their friends. Mr Cagliari said he had inherited a kick-backs system at
ENI and admitted to at least L27bn (Pounds 11.3m) being passed with his
knowledge to the Christian Democrats and Socialists.
Mr Cagliari was also being questioned about alleged corruption in the
reorganisation of the chemicals industry through the disposal of Enimont.
Magistrates claimed yesterday that Mr Cagliari had recently admitted to
knowing of L10bn going to the political parties.
Yet despite Mr Cagliari being such a key figure, he appeared to be held in
prison essentially as a means of pressure to make him talk.
Mr Vittorio D'Aiello, his lawyer, insisted this was the case and released
the transcript of his last interrogation on July 15 in which he said: 'I
have been nearly 140 days in San Vittore prison and still have sought to
maintain a certain reserve on some issues. At the same time I find it
ethically and psychologically difficult to adopt a course of action which
although it might help me would end up involving other people, perhaps
colleagues and friends I have known for years.'
Milan magistrates have adopted a clear carrot and stick approach with all
those under investigation. The pressures are considerable - two people have
died of heart attacks under investigation, including Mr Vincenzo Balzamo,
the Socialist party treasurer.
The second main criticism of the magistrates is that they have used the
aviso di garanzia - the judicial warning that a person is under
investigation - as a means of discrediting people.
The aviso has come to be seen as an automatic indication of guilt, even
though charges have not been pressed.

THE Russian parliament delivered a double blow to the government's
privatisation programme yesterday, suspending a presidential decree central
to the process and annulling a parliamentary law on the sale of state
companies.
Mr Anatoli Chubais, privatisation minister, said the action would 'deal a
blow to millions of people involved in (privatisation)'.
The presidential decree, issued in May, made it compulsory for all state
companies to sell a minimum 29 per cent stake at auctions when going
private. The decree helped boost the value of the privatisation vouchers
issued to all Russian citizens but was opposed by factory directors.
Mr Chubais predicted the parliament's ruling could hurt investor confidence
in the vouchers and precipitate a drop in their value.
The decree also required all small-scale privatisation to be completed by
August 1, a clause western advisers described as one of the most important
catalysts in the highly successful small-scale privatisation process.
Mr Jamie Hamilton, a consultant at the International Finance Corporation,
the private sector arm of the World Bank which has advised the Russian
government on privatisation, said: 'This will be an excuse for vast regions
of Russia to stop privatising.'
About 51,000, a third to a half of small-scale enterprises, have been
privatised.
By suspending part of its legislation on privatisation, the parliament
transferred responsibility for the privatisation process from the liberal
state property committee to the conservative sectoral ministries.
'This is another revanchist attempt by the parliament to destroy the reform
it dislikes most - privatisation,' said Mr Chubais, who stormed out of the
hall in protest.

<TEXT>
MR Leszek Balcerowicz, the former Polish finance minister, was yesterday
nominated as one of the candidates to succeed Mr Jacques Attali as president
of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD).
The nomination of Mr Balcerowicz, who was responsible for leading Poland's
'shock therapy' transition to a market economy, came amid strong signs that
the post will go to a western candidate.
Nominations for the vacancy, created by Mr Attali's resignation last week
after the row over lavish spending, close today. Mr Henning Christopherson,
the EC economics commissioner, is thought to be the other of two candidates
whose written nomination was received at the bank's London headquarters
yesterday.
The French government, however, has notified Mrs Anne Wibble, the Swedish
finance minister and chairman of the EBRD's board of governors, of the
candidacy of Mr Jacques de Larosiere, governor of the Bank of France. Mr de
Larosiere is regarded as the leading contender.
The French government claims wide international support for Mr de
Larosiere's candidacy, although the prime target of its lobbying has been
fellow EC countries. France has claimed a moral right to field the successor
to Mr Attali, following its 1990 arrangement with Britain that the bank
would be based in London in return for France providing the EBRD's
president.
Ms Hanna Gronkiewicz-Waltz, the Polish central bank chairman, submitted Mr
Balcerowicz's nomination yesterday afternoon. She pointed out in her letter
to the bank's board that no candidate from eastern or central Europe had yet
been considered.
Since he left the finance ministry in 1991 Mr Balcerowicz has been
lecturing, although he has advised the Ukrainian and Lithuanian governments
on economic reform.
Although he was praised by western governments for steering Poland through
the most difficult part of its economic reforms after 1989, his candidacy
faces difficulty in gaining widespread support from western governments.

SPECULATORS against the franc should remember that France still has a
collective competitive edge over its partners in the European monetary
system, Mr Jacques de Larosiere, the Bank of France governor, warned
yesterday.
The devaluations and floating of several currencies within the EMS in the
past year 'have far from wiped out the gains made by France since 1986', he
said. Since 1986 French unit wage costs had risen 11 per cent more slowly,
and producer prices had increased 6 per cent less, than the average for
other EMS countries, he claimed. The proof was that France's FFr16.2bn
(Pounds 1.84bn) trade surplus in the first quarter of this year was triple
that in the same period of 1992.
'The speculative attacks of recent days (against the franc) on the foreign
exchange markets bear no relation to the evolution of our (economic)
fundamentals,' he told the national credit council, a consultative body to
the central bank.
One positive economic indicator emerged yesterday with the release of
official Insee statistics showing that industrial production rose in May by
0.2 per cent compared with April.
The modest increase, which ended a three-month downward trend was welcomed
by the Finance Ministry, which forecast that the economy would move out of
recession in the second half of the year. 'Industrial activity has now
stabilised. This result is encouraging,' the ministry said.
But private economists said the slight rise in industrial production did not
necessarily signal that the economy had turned the corner. They said that
May's figures still represented a 3.4 per cent decline on the same period
last year and that reduced exports and weak consumer spending remained an
obstacle to recovery.
According to Insee, output by manufacturing industry increased by 0.3 per
cent in May. This included an increase of 1 per cent in output from the
motor sector, reflecting the launch of new models by Peugot, Renault and
Citroen, the French carmakers.

THE slight improvement in German car orders, detected during May, ground to
a halt last month, the VDA automobile industry association said yesterday.
June production of all vehicles, adjusted to allow for an extra working day
this year, was 29 per cent lower than a year earlier at 344,000. Unadjusted
output was down 25 per cent.
However, the VDA said the decline in the car industry appeared to have
reached bottom, but conditions for commercial vehicle makers were continuing
to deteriorate.
June's poor performance brought the cumulative decline in German motor
manufacturers' output to 25 per cent for the first half of this year. In
absolute figures, car production has tumbled 625,000 to 1.975m units.
Car exports, which account for around half the industry's output, were 19
per cent lower in June than a year earlier.
Output of light trucks up to 6 tonnes fell 34 per cent or 37,000 units to
72,000 between January and June.
The output of other commercial vehicles was down 36 per cent compared with
the same period last year.

FT  21 JUL 93 / Legal reverse for VW and Lopez
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE legal squeeze on the top management of Volkswagen was intensified
yesterday as a Hamburg civil court loosened reporting restrictions imposed
last month on Der Spiegel, Germany's leading news weekly.
The result will open up once again the public debate on claims by General
Motors of the US and its German subsidiary, Adam Opel, that Mr Jose Ignacio
Lopez de Arriortua, a former GM director, and several of his associates who
joined VW with him, took industrial secrets with them to the German group.
Meanwhile, speculation mounted that state prosecutors, investigating
possible criminal charges in the light of GM's claims, will make a formal
statement later this week.
After yesterday's ruling, which followed an open hearing last Thursday, the
magazine can, for example, resume reporting on its earlier claims that Mr
Lopez took boxes of industrial secrets with him when he quit GM for a
directorship at VW in March.
It may also pursue its charges that Mr Jose Manuel Gutierrez, a close
associate of Mr Lopez who followed his former GM chief to VW almost
immediately, asked for and was given 'strictly confidential' details of a
new GM diesel engine. The court, which imposed a gagging order at VW's
request last month after the publication of two detailed articles, also
lifted the injunction in regard to a claim that Mr Lopez had 'reached an
agreement' to join VW with Mr Ferdinand Piech, at the start of this year.
In an affidavit presented in court last week, and signed by Mr Piech, the VW
chairman stated that Mr Lopez decided to move on March 9.
The court also accepted testimony that Mr Lopez had in effect written a
speech, intended to explain to GM employees why he had decided not to join
VW, which was not in the event delivered. After checking the final draft on
the morning of March 15, he left the US for Germany. Mr Lopez stated in an
affidavit presented last Thursday that he did not write it, and that its had
been written by 'GM'. Mr Lopez and VW were represented at the hearing by a
single lawyer while Der Spiegel had more than 20 witnesses, all GM
employees, on hand to support its case. although only three were called. All
the claims on which the court loosened the gag yesterday have been firmly
and consistently denied by VW and its executives, although as Mr Harald
Ficus, presiding judge, said last week, his court was not the place for
deciding the truth or otherwise of the suspicions aired in Der Spiegel.
However, Volkswagen was obliged to bear most of the costs of the case.
In German courts apportionment of costs shows the extent to which the
parties involved have gained or lost, according to legal experts.
On the single issue of Der Spiegel's reports on diesel engine secrets, Mr
Gutierrez was made responsible for the whole DM100,000 (Pounds 38,759). In
another case, concerning complaints made in the German group's name -
including Mr Piech's claims on the planning and timing of Mr Lopez's switch
 -VW was obliged to pay two-thirds of the DM500,000 costs.

FT  21 JUL 93 / Delors ends budget revolt: EC president forces compromise on
regional funds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A DRAMATIC intervention by Mr Jacques Delors secured a deal on the 1994-99
structural funds budget for the EC's poorest regions early yesterday
morning.
The European Commission president picked off member states one by one,
putting down a revolt by ministers who feared they were about to lose their
share of the Ecu141.5bn (Pounds 107bn) budget.
But the price of a 5.30 am victory was a fudging of the final sums which
Brussels will deliver to member states, and some bruised feelings on the
part of Mr Bruce Millan, commissioner for regional aid.
Last Thursday, Mr Millan told Mr Delors that the latter's promise of IPounds
7.5bn (Pounds 7.1bn) to Ireland had undercut his negotiating position and
triggered an avalanche of counter-claims from other member states.
Mr Delors, still suffering from severe sciatica, invited Mr Millan to hold
further talks with member states in the margins of Monday's foreign affairs
meeting in Brussels.
But on the day, Mr Millan refused to commit himself to firm numbers,
provoking a revolt among member states who accused him of displaying a
'Scottish accountant's mentality'. Mr Millan's aides countered that some
countries' bids were more than 20 per cent over budget.
The result was that seven member states joined Ireland in refusing to back
the new rules for sharing out the structural funds. Summoned from his bed,
Mr Delors savaged the junior ministers present for being anti-Community and
threatened to expose their greed to assembled reporters.
Then, after a performance worthy of Tammany Hall's finest, Mr Delors and Mr
Millan persuaded the rebels states to accept the new guidelines, including
rough indications on what they could expect to receive from next January 1.
Under the deal, Ireland was assured it would receive IPounds 7.8bn over
seven years at 1993 prices, slightly less than the IPounds 8bn which the
Dublin government claimed it was promised at last December's EC summit in
Edinburgh.
The UK received an assurance of around Pounds 2 billion with the main
beneficiaries being the Highland and Islands, Merseyside and Northern
Ireland. East Germany will also receive a significant boost from the
structural funds, so too areas in eastern Europe such as the Czech republic
where the former communist regime in Berlin had strong trade ties. This is a
new development.
But the final deal was struck only because Mr Delors received support for
his own numbers. In Brussels parlance, these are known as fourchettes or
brackets which contain a range of figures and depend on a mixture of trust
and fudge. Just how these are allocated will depend on a final decision by
the Commission in September. EC officials in Brussels were still unsure
whether all of Mr Delors promises matched or exceeded the sums agreed last
December in Edinburgh.

FT  21 JUL 93 / Climate of reform brings rouble back from the dead: Russia's
currency revival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRYSTIA FREELAND and EDWARD BALLS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER many months of steady devaluation, the Russian rouble is bouncing
back.
Russia's currency has appreciated in value by 8 per cent over the past
month. It now trades at Rbs1,010 to the dollar, up from its June 15 low of
Rbs1,104.
The rouble's recent performance has become so robust that, after months of
futile efforts to prop up the currency, Russia's central bank has been able
to intervene heavily to build-up foreign exchange reserves and prevent the
appreciation going too far.
Western experts, close to the Russian government, estimate that the central
bank may have bought as much as Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m) in the past month
since the appreciation began, a third of which the bank has accumulated in
the last week.
The rise in the rouble is evidence that the Russian government's efforts to
stop the granting of central bank credit are working - and perceived to be
working. 'What we are seeing are the first effects of a step-by-step
stabilisation programme,' says Mr Charles Blitzer, the World Bank's chief
economist in Moscow.
Mr Blitzer believes that the events of the last few months have created the
perception that the Russian government is serious about reforms and boosted
confidence in the Russian currency.
The surprise popular endorsement of President's Yeltsin's market reforms in
the April referendum was followed in May by a credit agreement between the
Russian government and the central bank. This agreement was subsequently
approved by the International Monetary Fund and allowed the first tranche of
the IMF's 'Systemic Transformation Facility', worth Dollars 1.5bn (Pounds
1bn), to be disbursed in June.
However, only in the last month has the government begun to prove it will
implement this tight credit policy. Mr Boris Fyodorov, minister of finance,
has been able to out-manoeuvre advocates in parliament and some sections of
the cabinet of heavy spending by refusing to disburse credits issued to his
ministry.
The rouble's new-found strength has prompted Mr Fyodorov to make a public
offer to wager Rbs50,000 (about the average monthly salary) against any
taker who does not believe that the rouble will either maintain its current
rate against the dollar or continue to rise.
Disgruntled Russian industrial bosses say Mr Fyodorov's refusal to release
credits to them is one of the reasons why the finance minister might win his
bet. Mr Valery Remizev, vice-president of Russia's gas monopoly, Gazprom,
one of the country's principal exporters, complained yesterday that the
tight-fisted policy of the ministry of finance is forcing his company to
purchase roubles with its hard currency earnings in order to cover its wage
and tax bills. The government estimates that Russian companies have up to
Dollars 10bn stockpiled within the Russian banking system, backed by
deposits in correspondent accounts abroad.
A further incentive for Mr Remizev and other factory managers to buy roubles
with their dollars is the rising cost of borrowing in Russia. Last week the
central bank raised its discount lending rate to 170 per cent a year, double
the level of a month ago. The increase in interest rates, and expectation
that the tight credit policy will bring inflation down, are discouraging
factories from borrowing to finance their working capital. A third reason
behind the appreciation is the massive sell-off of Russian state assets to
the private sector. The pace of voucher privatisation is picking up.
Back in February, the government's privatisation vouchers, which have a face
value of Rbs10,000, were trading for only Rbs3,700. They have since all but
regained their face value, exceeding it on some exchanges.
Yet the rise in investor confidence that partly explains the current
appreciation of the rouble could just as quickly vanish if the reform
momentum falters and inflation does not come down from its current level of
17 per cent a month in June.
Mr Jeffrey Sachs, a Harvard economic professor and government adviser, is
urging the Russian government and the IMF to take advantage of the current
optimistic mood to negotiate a stand-by agreement before the end of the
summer. Such an agreement could unlock the Dollars 6bn stabilisation fund,
part of the aid package agreed by the group of seven industrialised
countries, which would then allow the government to fix the exchange rate.
A senior G7 official said recently he believed the Russian government had
taken the decisive steps needed to unlock the second Dollars 1.5bn tranche
of the STF. He called for accelerated negotiations to agree a stand-by
agreement before the autumn.
IMF officials will need to see evidence the Russian government has cut back
on the subsidies to industry and agriculture. The government has taken bold
step in the right direction, raising the price of natural gas sevenfold
yesterday and freeing coal prices earlier this month.
But without still deeper cuts in these subsidies, stabilisation cannot work.
Yet if these subsidies are cut, then industry will really scream. That, says
Mr Blitzer, is when 'the fiscal crunch will really start to bite. There has
been serious progress, but I don't think the Russian economy has turned the
corner yet.'

Mr Mirko Pejanovic, a Serbian member of the presidency, yesterday said the

proclaimed a United Nations protectorate.
Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, warned that 'if the Moslems do
not wish to lose everything they have to sit at the negotiating table as
soon as possible'.
Serb forces were reported yesterday to have seized the southwestern part of
Mount Igman, a key defence point for Sarajevo. Bosnian radio said the
Croatian Defence Council had interned 10,000 Moslems, mostly men, near
Capljina southwest of Mostar. It was using them to dig trenches and as human
shields.

FT  21 JUL 93 / BR sell-off attracts few would-be buyers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GOVERNMENT plans for privatising British Rail's passenger services are in
danger of being undermined by a lack of interest from would-be train
operators.
Although inquiries by the Financial Times have identified 16 companies
interested in bidding for passenger franchises, the overwhelming majority
are bus companies planning to operate a handful of local or regional railway
services.
Most of these companies are too small to contemplate bidding for
high-profile InterCity or Network SouthEast franchises because the risks
associated with these larger businesses would put too great a strain on
their financial resources.
As a result, most of the passenger service franchises are attracting little
or no interest from potential bidders, so raising the possibility that the
government will have to leave them in the hands of BR.
The government's plan is to split BR's passenger services into 25 franchises
and start putting them out to tender next year. Seven of the franchise areas
are currently operated by the InterCity division, 11 are operated by Network
SouthEast, and the remaining seven are operated by Regional Railways.
Among the InterCity services on offer, the relatively small Gatwick Express
service appears to be attracting some interest.
The larger operations appear to have been targeted by only three companies -
Sea Containers, the Bermuda-based shipping group; Mr Richard Branson's
Virgin Group; and Badger Rail, part of the Badgerline bus group.
Of these, Virgin says that its only interest is in bidding for the East
Coast main line as part of a larger consortium, and Sea Containers, which
wants to bid for the Great Western main line, is in danger of disqualifying
itself by insisting that it should take control of the tracks as well as the
trains. Badger Rail, which is also interested in the Great Western main
line, may well prove too small to take it on.
On Network SouthEast, the only franchise areas so far attracting interest
appear to be the South Western division comprising routes out of London
Waterloo; the London, Tilbury &amp; Southend line; and the 8 1/2 -mile Isle of
Wight railway.
Elsewhere, almost all the interest in privatisation appears to come from bus
companies wanting to take over rail services in their area and integrate
them with their bus operations. Transport ministers say concern about the
apparent lack of interest is unfounded because, at the very least,
management-employee buy-out teams will emerge as bidders for most of the
franchise areas.
But private sector bus companies say that buy-out teams will find it
difficult to secure the necessary financial backing to bid for the larger
InterCity and Network SouthEast businesses because lenders will not be
prepared to accept the risks involved.

FT  21 JUL 93 / Former Eni chief Cagliari found dead in prison
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR GABRIELE CAGLIARI, the former chairman of Eni, Italy's state oil concern,
was found dead in a Milan jail after magistrates refused to release him on
bail. Mr Cagliari was facing charges of corruption and illicit financing of
political parties.
Mr Paolo Liguori, a close friend of the family and editor of Il Giorno, the
daily newspaper owned by Eni, said Mr Cagliari, aged 67, had committed
suicide after 133 days in prison. He had been found alone in his cell with a
plastic bag tied round his head with a shoelace. He died of a heart attack
in the prison hospital after he failed to respond to artificial respiration.
Mr Francesco Saverio Borelli, the Milan attorney-general, said the former
Eni chairman had left behind several letters from which 'there emerges a
precise intent to commit suicide and thus on the nature of his death there
should be no doubt'.
If suicide is confirmed, it would be the ninth since Italian magistrates
began investigating corruption in February 1992.
Mr Cagliari's death shocked the political establishment and immediately
stoked a debate, initiated on July 8 by President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, on
the abuses of the system of preventive detention. Milan magistrates in
particular have used preventive detention as a means of extracting
confessions from suspects.
Mr Cagliari was arrested in March for alleged corruption concerning the
payment of bribes on a power station contract won by an Eni subsidiary.
However, it soon became clear the magistrates wished to question him about
his period as chairman of Eni since 1989, convinced that the state oil
concern was a significant source of illicit funding for political parties.
He was refused bail on five occasions, the most recent three days ago, even
though he had admitted knowing about bribes being paid at Eni. According to
Mr Vittorio D'Aiello, his lawyer, he still refused to incriminate friends
and colleagues.
Mr Cagliari, a distinguished engineer, had extensive international
experience in the oil and chemicals industries. Although a political
appointment of Mr Bettino Craxi when he was Socialist leader, he had had a
long career in Eni. When it became a public company last August, he was
forced to the sidelines as titular head.
The magistrates were reported to be pressing Mr Cagliari for details of the
reorganisation of the chemicals industry and the purchase by Eni of
Montedison's stake in their joint venture, Enimont.
Alleged kick-backs and illicit share deals in the 1989-90 Enimont affair are
also central to the interrogation of Mr Giuseppe Garofano, the former
Ferruzzi-Montedison chief executive, who was extradited from Switzerland
last week.

FT  21 JUL 93 / BA credit union may spur greater challenge to banks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH AIRWAYS has become the UK's first private sector employer to
establish a credit union in a move expected to encourage more companies to
offer banking services to their staff.
The credit union, which was registered with the Registry of Friendly
Societies in June, comes into full operation at the end of the month. It
hopes to attract several thousand members and eventually offer a full range
of financial services, including mortgages, cheque books and credit cards.
Credit unions in countries such as the US, which has more than 60m credit
union members, are permitted to offer banking services such as credit cards,
but British credit unions are barred from doing this.
However, a rapid expansion in the British credit union movement, which has
seen its membership and assets grow by about 40 per cent during the past
year, is fuelling demands that British credit unions be allowed to operate
along US lines.
The Association of British Credit Unions, which represents 190 of the
country's 405 credit unions, is drawing up proposals for new legislation
with the Registry of Friendly Societies, the sector's regulator, which it
hopes to put to parliament by the end of the year.
Mr Michael Parkinson, chief executive of Abcu, said a significant shift was
occuring in the role and image of credit unions, with the fastest growth
among public sector employee credit unions. These represent some 60 per cent
of the Pounds 30m of savings controlled by Abcu.
'A lot of credit unions now want to offer banking-type facilities. We don't
see why they can't - there is a lot of disillusionment with the banks and
building societies now,' he said.
Although credit unions had originally made their name by providing a banking
system for poor people who could not use banks, most credit union members
were now using them as an additional means of banking or source of cheap
loans, Mr Parkinson said. At present, credit unions are not allowed to
charge more than 12.68 per cent annual interest on loans, a rate that is
considerably cheaper than most bank loans.
Members of a credit union, however, are not allowed to borrow until they
have saved for three months, and in most cases can only borrow up to two or
three times the level of their savings, with a maximum loan of Pounds 5,000
plus an amount equal to their savings.
Although credit unions do not officially pay interest, and can only use
their members' savings as assets, they can pay dividends of up to 8 per cent
per annum.
The organisers of the British Airways UK credit union, who point out that
the airline has been running a credit union in the US for nearly 40 years,
say the move has already prompted inquiries from other companies.
Other credit union organisers yesterday said reform of the sector could be a
difficult battle.
Ms June Nightingale, administrator at the Glasgow City Council credit union,
which has more than 4,000 members, said: 'It will probably take years before
we can offer mortgages or credit cards because we are going to be up against
the banks and the building societies.'

FT  21 JUL 93 / Fayeds to float House of Fraser store chain: Brothers
believe they can repay debts and retain control of Harrods
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY and ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE House of Fraser department store chain, which includes such names as
Army &amp; Navy and Dickins &amp; Jones, is to be floated on the stock market next
year.
However, the Fayed brothers, who bought the group in 1985 for about Pounds
600m after a bitter battle with Mr Tiny Rowland and his Lonhro conglomerate,
are excluding Harrods, the chain's flagship store, from the sale.
The brothers believe the flotation of the 59-store chain will enable them to
pay off their debts and keep Harrods, always seen as the main object of
their takeover of House of Fraser.
House of Fraser group denied yesterday that the Fayeds were under financial
pressure and said they had arranged a refinancing in April.
House of Fraser said the Fayeds had been told by SG Warburg, their advisers,
that a flotation was in the best interests of the chain and of the brothers.
The group had not ruled out the possibility of a trade sale but 'we are not
anticipating that'.
Warburg is thought to have valued the stores at more than Pounds 500m,
although analysts expressed scepticism at this.
Mr Ali Fayed stepped down as chairman of the stores chain yesterday and will
be replaced by Mr Brian McGowan, who recently announced he was retiring as
chief executive of Williams Holdings at the end of 1993 to spend more time
fishing. Yesterday, Mr McGowan, 48, said he was sufficiently convinced of
House of Fraser's strengths to postpone his retirement.
The flotation of the chain, which stretches from Inverness to Plymouth and
has property assets valued at Pounds 250m, is expected by early next summer.
The Fayeds will not retain a stake in the stores and their holding company
name will be changed.
As well as Harrods, the brothers will retain control of Turnbull and Asser,
the upmarket shirt-maker, the Kurt Geiger shoe chain, the Barkers shops and
office complex in Kensington, the Carlton Highland Hotel in Edinburgh and
the Harrods depository in Barnes, west London.
A management buy-out of the stores in April is believed to have failed
because the management was unable to raise the Pounds 320m asking price. In
the same month, the Fayeds sold their 10.6 per cent stake in the Sears
retailing group, raising speculation that the group was in financial
difficulties with debts of about Pounds 650m.
Both Mr McGowan and SG Warburg have made it clear they will resign if the
Fayeds try to exert any influence on the House of Fraser stores. Mr McGowan
said: 'From today the Fayeds have bowed out. If they try and come back I
will resign . . . We are running the House of Fraser as a separate
autonomous business.'
Before becoming non-executive chairman, Mr McGowan insisted that he should
be able to resign without having to give any notice to the Fayeds. 'That
preserves my independence,' he said.
Mr McGowan plans to add to the board with the appointment of two or three
more non-executives over the coming months.

FT  21 JUL 93 / McGowan to float House of Fraser
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Brian McGowan contemplates his latest challenge: preparing the 59-store
House of Fraser Stores group for flotation next year.
The Egyptian Fayed brothers, who took over the stores in 1985, said
yesterday they planned to float the chain next spring or summer - with the
exception of the flagship Harrods. Mr Ali Fayed stepped down as chairman in
favour of Mr McGowan.
Mr McGowan recently announced he was retiring as chief executive of Williams
Holdings at the end of 1993 to spend more time fishing. He turned down
several other approaches but said the offer from House of Fraser 'rather
appealed to me'. Assisting him will be Mr Andrew Jennings, managing director
(left) and Mr Richard Scott, finance director (right).
The Fayed brothers hope floating the House of Fraser stores, believed to
have been valued at more than Pounds 500m by advisers SG Warburg, will allow
them to pay off their debts while retaining control of Harrods.

FT  20 JUL 93 / International Company News: RBS buys private bank for Pounds
10.5m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ROYAL Bank of Scotland is buying Adam &amp; Co, the Edinburgh private bank, a
year after Adam's capital was temporarily wiped out by a Pounds 21m (Dollars
31.5m) loss from unauthorised foreign exchange dealing.
Royal Bank is paying Pounds 10.5m for the private bank which was formed in
1983. Some Pounds 9.5m of that will go to Mrs Francoise Schlumberger Primat,
a French shareholder who rescued Adam &amp; Co last year by injecting Pounds
21m.
Mrs Primat, 75, chose to take the loss rather than wait for her convertible
preference shares to be repaid over 20 years. They had a zero coupon for the
next 10 years and then a 5 per cent annual payment.
Mr James Laurenson, Adam's deputy chairman and managing director who will
become a non-executive director, believed Mrs Primat had 'decided that there
was an inherent loss, and that she should crystallise it now'.
The net asset value of Adam &amp; Co, which has 4,000 private banking clients,
is Pounds 13.5m. Mr Laurenson said it had opted to sell at a discount to
book value because it would be burdened by the repayment of Mrs Primat's
preference shares.
Mr Laurenson said Lazard Brothers, the merchant bank which was retained to
advise on the future of Adam, had recommended the sale as the bank would
otherwise be held back.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Abdulmalik Abdulajanov, Tajikistan's prime minister, yesterday accused
the leadership of neighbouring Afghanistan of being behind last week's
bloody attack by Tajik opposition fighters on Russian border guards, Reuter
reports from Moscow.
He said commanders of the Afghan army's 55th division had taken part in the
attack on July 13, adding: 'One can hardly imagine that Kabul knew nothing
about it.'
His charges went much further than anything yet said by the Russian
government which, while angered by the attack in which it lost 25 border
guards, has avoided linking it to the Kabul leadership.
They seemed likely to increase tension between Moscow and Kabul, which has
accused Russian forces of killing up to 360 civilians in punitive raids on
Afghan border areas last weekend.
The Afghan leadership is appealing to the United Nations to halt the
deployment of extra Russian forces along the border.
It has also asked for emergency aid for the victims of what it called cruel
artillery attacks.
The attack by Tajik rebels from Afghan territory on a border post, manned
jointly by Russian and Tajik servicemen, led to a battle in which the 25
guards and more than 100 civilians were killed.
Russia has sent extra troops to the Tajik-Afghan border area, which it is
helping to protect under an accord last year, and has vowed to strike back.
This has prompted indignant protests from Afghanistan where memories of the
Soviet Union's decade-long military intervention are still fresh.
Mr Abdulajanov dismissed Afghanistan's reports of retaliatory attacks by the
Russians.
A Russian defence ministry spokesman also denied the attack. But one member
of a Russian parliamentary commission sent to investigate last week's
fighting said local forces had shelled rebel positions in Afghanistan.

CHINA has invited an official from Taiwan to visit the mainland, the first
such contact since the ideological arch-rivals held historic talks in
Singapore in April, Reuter reports from Beijing.
China's quasi-official Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits
extended the invitation to Mr Cheyne Chiu, secretary general of Taiwan's
Straits Exchange Foundation, the official Xinhua news agency reported
yesterday.
Both organisations were set up as ostensibly unofficial bodies to explore
and foster bilateral contacts. The letter asked the Taiwan side to propose
dates and an agenda for Mr Chiu's visit, Xinhua said.
Mr Chiu visited Beijing early this year to arrange the Singapore meeting
between Mr Wang Daohan, chairman of the Chinese body, and Mr Koo Chen-fu,
his Taiwanese counterpart. The talks marked the first direct contact between
the Cold War rivals since Chiang Kai-shek and his vanquished Nationalists
fled to Taiwan at the close of the Chinese civil war in 1949.
Beijing and Taipei espouse eventual reunification of Taiwan and China, a
goal that is opposed by Taiwan's growing opposition party, the Democratic
Progressive Party.
Cross-straits relations have warmed in recent years as the rivals have
become economically interdependent.
In Taipei, officials said the government was studying conditions under which
it could exchange representative offices with China, but added that such a
breakthrough in relations is unlikely soon.

About 20 Indian domestic workers alleging misconduct by employers flew home
two weeks ago under a Kuwaiti-funded repatriation programme, the embassy
said yesterday, Reuter reports from Kuwait. The women had been living at an
embassy refuge for several months. Their return home coincided with the
repatriation of about 400 Filipino maids who had also accused employers of
abuse. The embassy said the main allegations by the Indian maids were
non-payment of wages and excessive work.

FT  20 JUL 93 / German court's ruling allays asylum law fears

<TEXT>
GERMANY'S federal constitutional court last night dismissed an appeal by an
asylum-seeker from Ghana facing deportation, allaying fears that legal
appeals would be systematically used to circumvent Germany's tough new
asylum law.
German officials were worried that asylum-seekers whose applications have
been denied by the government would use the court system to avoid
deportation. Under the new law asylum-seekers arriving at German airports
directly from their countries of origin can be deported within three days if
the Federal Office for Refugees rejects their claims.
They can appeal to local administrative courts within two days, with the
court required to rule on the case within two weeks. A final appeal to the
constit-utional court is then possible.
Fears that appeals would be used to undermine the screening system and
burden the German legal system arose last Friday after the constitutional
court, in its first ruling since the new asylum law came into effect on July
1, granted an Indian asylum-seeker the right to stay pending a second
hearing next month.
The man, who said he faced persecution by Kashmiri police, was due to be
deported after arriving at Frankfurt airport. But the court ruled that his
case needed further examination.
Asylum-seekers arriving from 'safe third countries' which include all
bordering countries, can be sent back to those countries without a hearing.
According to the federal interior ministry, the new law has led to a
reduction in the number of asylum applicants.

FT  20 JUL 93 / Treuhand grants potash mine reprieve
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BERLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Treuhand, the agency charged with restructuring and privatising eastern
German industry, has reversed its decision to close a loss-making potash
mine, in a move to ensure its radical plan to merge western and eastern
Germany's potash sector is implemented.
The decision to give a reprieve to 700 jobs at the Bischofferoder mine in
the state of Thuringia follows a two-week hunger strike by 47 employees.
Five hunger strikers have been admitted to hospital.
The Treuhand and the state government propose that the mine should stay open
temporarily to save jobs until 1995.
The Treuhand originally envisaged closing Bischofferoder as part of a
package to merge Kali + Salz, a BASF subsidiary, with Mitteldeutschen Kali,
the east German producer. With the merger, the Treuhand aimed to save the
remaining five eastern German mines, and reduce capacity in an industry
plagued by overcapacity. Last year, 35m tonnes were produced worldwide but
less than 25m tonnes sold. Before 1989, eastern Germany's potash mines were
producing more than 3m tonnes a year with a workforce of 33,000, compared to
western Germany's annual production of 2.4m with 11,000 employees.
As part of its merger plan, the Treuhand has already made two unprecedented
moves. Firstly, it proposed that the western Germany potash sector should
share the burden in reducing the workforce. The number of jobs at Kali +
Salz will be reduced by 1,744 to 4,488, and at Mitteldeutschen Kali by 1,884
to 3,012.
Secondly, the Treuhand has taken a 49 per cent stake, worth DM1bn (Dollars
588m), in the merger, with an option to sell its share after five years.
Mr Helmut Ballon, the Treuhand's director of mining and non-metallic
minerals, has said: 'We had to think of reducing capacity. We decided on a
radical approach which would not only save jobs, but perhaps give a new
lease of life to Germany's potash industry.'
The merger followed 48 unsuccessful attempts to seek foreign partners for
the east German industry. It will need European Community approval because
it will create a virtual monopoly. A Treuhand official yesterday expected
the Commission would rule in favour of the merger, since total German
capacity would be reduced to an annual 3.1m tonnes.

over payments

<TEXT>
KIRIN Brewery, Japan's largest brewer, said its chairman and two other
executives would step down after last week's arrests of four company
employees, suspected of paying up to Y33m (Dollars 308,411) to sokaiya, or
racketeers.
Mr Hideyo Motoyama, Kirin's chairman, Mr Teruchika Ishii, vice-president,
and another executive willresign at the end of this month.
Last October, Mr Masatoshi Ito, the president of Ito-Yokado, a leading
retailer, was forced to resign after three Ito-Yokado officials were
arrested for payments of Y27m to sokaiya.
Kirin's payments to gangsters are believed to have started after a
shareholders' meeting in 1983, which lasted five hours due to questions from
the racketeers.
The company said it would cut bonus payments for Mr Keisaku Manabe, company
president, by 30 per cent, and by 15 per cent for Mr Yasushi Yamamoto,
vice-president. Other board members face a 15 per cent cut.
Kirin suspended all beer advertisements last week. The company said the
suspension would last 'for the time being' saying it was wrong for the
company to actively publicise its products at the same time as apologising
for the scandal.
Kirin has acquired 50 per cent of Hiljo, the Dutch flower-exporting
subsidiary of Finnish state-owned chemicals group, Kemira.
The Japanese brewer has taken an option to acquire the remainder of Hiljo,
which has annual turnover of about Dollars 35m, at a later date. No price
was announced.
Faber Group has entered into a joint venture with Granton International,
part of the Sheraton International group, to develop a hotel and a
commercial complex in Kuala Lumpur, Reuter reports. Faber will take up 51
per cent of the venture company, Inter-Heritage.

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
News of an agreement between the United Nations and Iraq over weapon
monitoring sent oil prices falling to their lowest level since just before
the Gulf war, casting a shadow over the UK oil sector.
Many analysts perceived the agreement as making an accord on Iraqi oil sales
easier, increasing the supply on the world market and thus weakening oil
prices further. The day's casualties included BP, where the shares fell 6
1/2 to 285 1/2 p in trade of 6.4m. Shell Transport slipped 4 to 607p on 3m
traded.
However, the oils team at Strauss Turnbull said the decline in Shell offered
investors a good buying opportunity, saying: 'It is more involved in the
refining and marketing end than BP, which makes it a more defensive stock.'
Lasmo shed 2 to 137 1/2 p. British Gas continued to recover and added 4 at
298p.
News that SmithKline Beecham had applied to register a new herpes treatment
helped the shares close higher and was largely responsible for a sharp fall
in Wellcome. The latter has the lion's share of the Pounds 750m a year
herpes market, with the leading drug Zovirax. SmithKline firmed a penny to
416p and Wellcome was 30 down at 604p.
Union Discount moved forward 6 to 151p ahead of figures due next Monday.
International trading group BAT Industries bucked the market trend and
declined 6 to 431p, in trade of 4.4m, on a combination of profit-taking
following last week's strong run, and nervous trading awaiting figures from
US rival Philip Morris.
Legal &amp; General jumped 14 to 510p as dealers appreciated the 27 per cent
increase in new business that it announced yesterday. Prudential Corporation
put on 6 at 348p in sympathy.
Among composite insurers, Commercial Union was in demand, with Hoare Govett
said to be positive. The shares gained 11 at 631p.
Abbey National, a poor feature last week, recovered 7 to 409p. Credit
Lyonnais Laing was said to have advised investors to switch into Abbey and
out of National Westminster, whose shares nevertheless firmed 4 to 506p.
Speculative talk about the long expected sale by TSB of Hill Samuel, its
merchant banking arm, continued to circulate, sending the shares up 5 to
204p.
Weekend press reports that Great Universal Stores was considering ways of
distrib-uting a cash pile estimated at Pounds 1.5bn to shareholders saw the
shares sustain last week's momentum. The 'A' stock rose 47 to 1957p, while
the ordinary added 90 at 3490p. Last week the stock surged after the company
announced its intention to enfranchise the non-voting shares.
Hopes of a cut in German interest rates pushed the share price of Redland
ahead 13 to 481p. Spring Ram benefited from the filip of bid speculation and
moved up 4 to 54p.
Confidence that its recent rights issue would prove a success began to turn
the tables for United Newspapers after its bruising in the UK tabloid
newspaper price wars. The stock improved 5 to 523p.
BAA, the UK airports operator, appreciated 4 to 735p after it predicted
traffic growth of around 4 per cent for this year.
Container rental group Tiphook, which reported a loss last week, continued
out of favour. Late afternoon bargain hunters helped the shares close off
the bottom, finishing a net 21 down at 230p.
The 10 'Recs' that went ex-dividend were greeted by a positive response from
the market, with several notching up price rises on the day. Midlands
finished 13 1/2 higher at 503p, while its neighbour East Midlands was 16
ahead at 457p. London rose 15 to 483p.
A technicality born of a thin market was cited by one analyst as the reason
behind an increase of nearly 15 per cent for Campari, the sporting clothes
company. Campari, which has issued two profits warnings this year, moved up
20 to 133p.
Reconstruction moves sent the price of UK Land into freefall, leaving it at
4p for a decline of 26p.
Optimism ahead of Thursday's agm drove Regalian Properties up 2 to 17 1/2 p,
while the rest of the sector held on to its recent firmness.
International mining group RTZ forged ahead 14 to 683p after announcing the
sale of its US oil and gas interests for Dollars 510m. Market watchers had
expected the sale but the price obtained for the disposal was well above the
best estimates of many analysts.
Mr Emil Morfett at Smith New Court, which turned buyers of the stock earlier
this month, said: 'RTZ is renowned for getting premium prices for its assets
on disposals and this is another of those examples.' He expects further
disposals soon.

ahead at 435p in hefty volume of 9.5m.
Manoplax had been dogging the Boots price for several weeks after a research
report suggested that too high a dosage could be lethal. Boots' decision
yesterday will add around 6 per cent to earnings in the year to March 1995,
according to analysts. Speculation that the company may entertain offers for
the drugs division generated further excitement, although most stores
specialists were sceptical. The business turned over around Pounds 550m last
year.

FT  20 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: Medeva shock
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A shock profits warning from Medeva sent shares in the group tumbling 100 to
116p, and did further damage to a drugs sector weak from recent adverse
comment. Turnover was a very heavy 28m shares, accounting for nearly 10 per
cent of the issued equity. The dramatic fall in the share price revealed
deeper worries in the market over the quality of the stock.
The company warned that problems at one of its US subsidiaries would mean
profits some Pounds 10m below market forecasts for this year. One
pharmaceuticals specialist commented: 'Medeva has always based its earnings
growth on its acquisitions and now one of those has gone wrong. The market
is worried that it could happen elsewhere.' There were also darker hints
that warnings of trading worries at the group had been circulating in the
market for some weeks, but had been firmly rejected by sources close to the
company.

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   DEALING in BT3 got off to a sprightly start as the new shares
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
the government's final 22 per cent tranche of BT - jumped to a healthy
premium, although profit-taking later took the shine off the first day's
trading.
Dealers reported that, as expected, small investors were first in the queue
to off-load their shares as trading began. With institutional investors
ready to buy up available stock, the shares jumped to an immediate 20p
premium. Some institutions had received fewer shares than they had applied
for, the global share offer being five times oversubscribed.
As the session got under way, there was also increasing arbitraging between
the new partly-paid and ordinary shares. Turnover in the former reached 187m
both ways out of the total issue of 1.22bn. The shares peaked in mid-morning
at 175p, before profit-taking and a slackening in demand. They closed at
168p, a rise of 18 on the day. The ordinary put on 5 at 413 1/2 p in
exceptionally heavy turnover of 72m.
While the stabilisation programme being undertaken by SG Warburg, the
government's adviser, will limit downward pressure, analysts are predicting
a dull time for the new BT stock. 'Increased competition and regulatory
concerns will be hanging over the issue for some months to come,' said one
telecoms specialist.

FT  20 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE shadow of BT3 and the first day of the new trading account had a calming
effect on stock index futures, although the September FT-SE 100 contract
managed to push through its recent resistance level, Christine Buckley
writes.
Dealers are also maintaining some caution ahead of Thursday's Commons vote
on the Maastricht treaty. Additionally they were stymied by a starvation
diet of economic data.
The contract opened at 2,842 and dipped shortly afterwards to the day's low
of 2,838. Then it began to find its feet and commenced a steady climb to a
high for the session of 2,863, which was reached about 10am. Volume was
modest at 6,359 contracts.
The future was a healthy 8 1/2 points ahead of its fair value premium to
cash, which is estimated at 4 points.
A trader was surprised at how little the market made of the September
contract breaching its resistance level which has settled at 2,850 in recent
sessions, but put it down to hesitation in the absence of economic
statistics.
Volume was poor in traded options, with the total number of lots, at 19,211,
registering a fall of more than 7,000 from Friday's figure. Not
surprisingly, BT proved to be the most active of the stock options, on 2,959
lots transacted. The Euro FT-SE 100 option performed well at 3,090
contracts, with the FT-SE 100 option just ahead at 3,246 lots.

FT  20 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: Early gains trimmed before the close
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE HIGHLY promoted debut of the UK government's remaining stake in BT gave
some encouragement to the London stock market yesterday, but failed to
provide the overall impetus for which equity strategists had been hoping.
The improved economic statistics announced last week were overshadowed by
the prospects for Thursday's important parliamentary debate on the
Maastricht legislation.
Both the new BT stock (BT3) and the FT-SE 100 Index closed well below the
day's best and investment confidence was dented by a new round of
unfavourable developments in the pharmaceuticals sector.
In spite of an early and successful start for the new BT issue, the London
market opened lower behind weakness in the Far East following the outcome of
the elections in Japan. A loss of six points on the Footsie, which also
reflected price adjustments for dividend payments, was recovered only when
the stock index futures opened higher.
With the BT tranche soon at a premium of 25 to the 150p partly-paid issue
price, and the existing BT stock strong in sympathy, the Footsie showed a
gain of 13.7 early in the session. However, the rest of the day saw the
market struggling and failing to hold on to its early levels.
By the close the FT-SE 100 had slipped to 2,842.9 for a rise of 9.9 on the
day. The UK market was discouraged by strains in the oil market as Opec
announced a meeting of its ministerial committee within a month.
Equity trading volume was heavily swollen by the BT issue. Turnover of 186m
shares in BT3 and of 70m in existing BT stock made up about one-third of
total Seaq business for the day of 760.4m shares. Non-Footsie business
remained good, providing about 63 per cent of the total in spite of the
focus on the telecommunications sector. On Friday, 628.8m shares were traded
through the Seaq network for a retail value of Pounds 1.44bn.
Second line issues followed the general trend, bringing a loss of 6.2 to
3,211.3 in the FT-SE Mid 250 Index.
Enthusiasm for the BT sale was somewhat muted. Several analysts pointed out
that nearly every important securities house in the London market is
effectively gagged for the next two months from commenting or forecasting
results for the UK telecommunications group. Some houses are believed to
take a cautious view of BT's profits prospects and, following the allocation
of 40 per cent of the BT3 stock to them, not all UK institutions were
aggressive buyers in the market yesterday.
A further blow to the market came from the drugs sector. Shares in Boots
responded favourably when the board announced that it was abandoning
Manoplax, its heart drug, which has suffered extremely adverse research
scrutiny. But there was a steep fall in Medeva stock after the board
disclosed that this year's profits will be Pounds 10m below expectations
because of problems in the US.
This news, on top of further pressure on pharmaceuticals from the US,
brought widespread losses in this blue chip sector. Meanwhile, the economic
optimism rekindled by the latest data on manufacturing output, unemployment
and inflation still requires confirmation in the form of improved corporate
profits.

FT  20 JUL 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Slim gains for Dow as
Appleeffect remains
</HEADLINE>

Wall Street
EQUITIES posted slim gains on Wall Street yesterday in spite of the shock
waves which continued to reverberate in the technology sector following
Apple Computer's disappointing results released last week, writes Karen
Zagor in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 6.99 at 3,535.28. The
more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 ended a slight 0.28 firmer at
446.03, but the American SE composite slipped 2.99 to 433.48 and the Nasdaq
composite lost 3.90 to 695.83.
Volume on the New York SE was a moderate 216m shares and declines
outnumbered rises by 1,056 to 854. On Friday the Dow fell 22.64 to 3,528.29.
Apple Computer declined Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 25 5/8 as investors
continued to register their disappointment with the company's third-quarter
performance. The stock dropped Dollars 7 3/4 on Friday. Among other Nasdaq
technology issues, Adobe Systems shed Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 52, Cisco
Systems slipped Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 49 1/2 and Microsoft lost Dollars 2
3/8 to Dollars 78 3/4 .
On the big board, International Business Machines fell Dollars 2 to a
52-week low of Dollars 43 5/8 , Digital Equipment lost Dollars 1 5/8 to
Dollars 37 5/8 and Hewlett Packard dipped Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 73 3/4 ,
but Compaq held steady at Dollars 43 5/8 .
Oil shares moved higher in tandem with oil futures, after Opec announced an
extraordinary meeting for July. Mobil gained Dollars  7/8 at Dollars 70 1/4
, Chevron improved Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 83 5/8 and Texaco rose Dollars 1
3/8 to Dollars 62 5/8 .
Pharmaceutical issues dominated NYSE trading, with Merck, the world's
biggest drugs company, falling Dollars 1 to a 52-week low of Dollars 32 1/8
. Wellcome's ADRs closed unchanged at Dollars 9 1/8 in heavy trading, Glaxo
Holdings' ADRs lost Dollars  1/4 to a year's low of Dollars 15 5/8 , but
Schering-Plough put on Dollars  3/8 at Dollars 64 7/8 .
In morning trading the sector was hit by reports that some analysts believe
that the industry has not responded sufficiently to protect earnings from
generic competition for own name-brand drugs, and from pressure in the
private sector to contain costs.
The banks sector, however, was lifted by strong earnings from Chase
Manhattan, which added Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 32 3/4 . Citicorp moved
forward Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 32 and Bank of New York firmed Dollars 1/2
to Dollars 57.
Transportation stocks benefited from news that employees at United Airlines
have proposed taking a stake in the company in exchange for making
substantial labour concessions. The Dow Jones Transportation Average was
3.21 higher at 1,551.13. UAL, parent of United Airlines, fell Dollars 3 1/2
to Dollars 133, AMR, parent of American Airlines, rose Dollars  1/4 to
Dollars 61, USAir held steady at Dollars 14 7/8 and Delta Air Lines gained
Dollars  7/8 at Dollars 48 1/2 .
Canada
TORONTO finished a shaky session sharply weaker but off the day's low as oil
and gas issues began to pull out of their steep retreat. A trader said
stocks are beginning to look attractive at these levels, especially some of
the energy shares.
The TSE 300 index lost 34.0 at 3,867.7. Declining issues outpaced advances
by 463 to 237 and volume was 48.2m shares.
Twelve of the 14 sub-indices lost ground. Transportation fell 2.2 per cent,
the communications group receded 2 per cent and the energy sub-index was a
net 1.8 per cent lower.

FT  20 JUL 93 / World Stock Markets: Strategists consider post-election
Japan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM COCHRANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Last week, prospects for Japanese politicians, the Japanese economy and the
Tokyo equity market loomed large in the global equity performance charts.
The FT-Actuaries World Index rose by 0.6 per cent in local currency terms,
with Japan's 2.7 per cent gain outweighing weakness in the US, and a flat
performance from Europe.
On the political front, there were suggestions from the market as the week
went on that the Liberal Democratic party could hold its ground in last
Sunday's elections, or that a coalition would be formed around a core
conservative party. As it happened, the LDP lost its overall majority.
The UBS global research team does not think that this is necessarily a
disaster. In a preview of the current week, it says that for all the talk of
political reform in Japan, the market would probably respond well to the
consistency implied by an LDP-led government, 'particularly if it was in
partnership with some of the new centre-right parties'.
UBS notes that there has been a growing consensus among the various Japanese
political parties that a tax cut is needed to sustain recovery. 'However,'
it points out, 'the exact nature and timing of its introduction will depend
upon the make-up of what is certain to be a coalition government.' Caution,
which seems implicit in this note, was reflected in a 0.9 per cent fall in
the Nikkei index yesterday.
The US, meanwhile, mixed good inflation news seen early in the week with
poor results, consumer and corporate expectations later as the quarterly
results season got under way. So gains resulting from the essential weakness
in the economy - reflected in a fall in the producer price index, and in
bond yields - were overtaken by a high-impact downgrade of drug issues by
Smith, Barney on Thursday, and by losses at Apple Computer, and a weak
consumer confidence report on Friday.

FT  20 JUL 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Carmakers diverge in
post-bourse German trade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INTERNATIONAL interest in German shares, once again, provided too much
action for the official Frankfurt session to accomodate, writes Our Markets
Staff.
FRANKFURT managed to bridge a whole weekend as strength in last Friday's
post-bourse, where the DAX index closed at 1,829.43, was translated into a
rise of 22.83 to 1,836.29 in yesterday's official session.
Turnover rose from DM7.7bn to DM9.4bn. Mr Eckhard Frahm, of Merck Finck in
Dusseldorf, said that the rally was broadening its base again. Foreign
buyers, including Britons, re-entered the German market after some
consolidation last week and DB Research, with buy recommendations for six
companies, added its considerable weight to the serious analytical and
strategic support which equities had already received.
Inter-alia, the DB six included Daimler, Siemens, BASF and Viag. These four,
accounting for a lot of the weight in the DAX, rose by DM15.50 to DM693,
DM8.50 to DM656.50, DM8.90 to DM261.50 and DM8.50 to DM393.50 respectively,
and Deutsche Bank itself gained DM10.50 to DM738.50.
Stocks which did better than most included BMW, up DM18 to DM576, and
climbing further to DM581.50 in the London post bourse. BMW, said Mr Frahm,
is seen as a safer haven than Daimler - or Volkswagen, which fell DM2.70 to
DM357.80, and then another DM6.30 to DM351.50 in the afternoon as the market
awaited judgement in one of the legal actions following the movement of Mr
Ignacio Lopex and staff from General Motors to VW.
PARIS moved higher in thin volume, the CAC 40 index closing at 1,981.70, up
6.77 in turnover of just FFr1.8bn. Dealers accused Warburg of a possible
downgrade in the case of BSN, down FFr15 to FFr852, but Bacot Allain,
Warburg's Paris subsidiary, said that it still had BSN as a 'hold'.
Gains on the day included Air Liquide, up FFr15 to FFr750 and seen as a
beneficiary of Eruopean economic rercovery; and Vallourec, FFr12.70 to a new
1993 high of FFr198.90 after a FFr13.70 gain on Friday, which suggested
position building to Paris professionals.
AMSTERDAM continued its climb on demand for cyclical stocks, combined with
options-led buying and carry-through short-covering after Friday's July
index contract expiry. The CBS Tendency General index rose 1.4 to 119.4.
Nedlloyd remained in demand on continuing speculation about the possibility
of a merger, in spite of last week's denial that the group planned to link
its container shipping arm with Sea Land, the US shipping group. The shares
rose Fl 3.70 or 9.7 per cent to a 12 month high of Fl 41.80.
Recently favoured cyclicals continued higher. Hoogovens rose 70 cents to Fl
41.80, Akzo Fl 3.80 to Fl 165.80 and Stork Fl 1.40 to Fl36.90.
MILAN finished easier in volatile trading which left the Comit index 1.28
lower at 555.13. However, some stocks received a bost from improved
liquidity, following their listing on the market's electronic trading system
last Friday.
Fiat, newly-listed on the electronic system, rose L141 or 2 per cent to
L6,780 amid continuing talk of an asset sale or international accord.
In a broadly firmer telecommunications sector, Sirti, another newcomer to
the system, added L330 or 3.5 per cent to L9,580.
Ferruzzi fell L29 or 7.7 per cent to L346 and Montedison was marked L47 or
7.3 per cent lower at L590. The shares came under renewed pressure amid
concern that revelations by Mr Guiseppe Garafolo, a former executive, to
magistrates investigating the country's political scandal, might imperil the
rescue package being prepared by creditors.
Olivetti moved L66 or 3.9 per cent ahead to L1,765, in heavy trade on hopes
that the consortium which it heads will win franchises for Italy's second
mobile telephone operator.
ZURICH came under profit taking pressure which left the SMI index 14.4 lower
at 2,396.4.
Roche certificates shed SFr70 to SFr5,005, triggering concern that stop-loss
selling might begin if the issue falls below SFr5,000.
UBS bearers, one of the recent rally leaders, added SFr11 to SFr1,167 while
CS Holdings shed SFr50 to SFr2,785. Analysts said that there was no change
in fundamentals to explain a SFr18, or 2.2 per cent rise in Brown Boveri to
SFr839.
STOCKHOLM continued higher for the 10th consecutive session and the
Affarsvarlden index added 4.1 to 1,152.1.
However, Ericsson B shares, last week's star performer, went against the
trend, easing SKr2 to SKr378.
Shares in Frontline, the bulk shipping group, remained suspended at the
close after the company had said that it planned to place shares at SKr21
each with a consortium of foreign institutions, raising a maximum of
SKr420m. The shares were SKr2 higher at SKr29 in early trading.
BRUSSELS saw the Bel-20 fall 7.98 to 1,319.47 as the retailer, GIB, dropped
by BFr38 to BFr1,274 in active volume of 83,600 shares. Dealers blamed
profit-taking after last week's gains.
VIENNA rose by 2.4 per cent, Austrian Airlines leading the market higher
with a gain of Sch90, or 5.4 per cent to Sch1,750 as the ATX index briefly
breached the 900 level before easing to close 20.78 higher at 898.77.

FT  20 JUL 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei slips as Pakistan
welcomes caretaker premier

<TEXT>
INVESTORS reacted cautiously to the outcome of Sunday's lower house
election, where the ruling Liberal Democratic party lost its hold on power
and share prices receded on arbitrage-linked selling, writes Emiko Terazono
in Tokyo.
The Nikkei average shed 180.61 to 20,150.92, the first fall in three trading
days. The index rose to a day's high of 20,350.53 at the start of the
session, but soon fell to the day's low of 20,089.71.
An estimated 260m shares changed hands, down from Friday's 344m. Declines
outnumbered rises by 640 to 337, with 188 stocks unchanged. The Topix index
of all first section issues slipped 8.20 to 1,644.68, and in London the
ISE/Nikkei 50 index eased 0.14 to 1,252.71.
While the result of the lower house elections came as little surprise,
investors were reluctant to take fresh positions because of the uncertainty
over who will lead the next government.
Traders said that, while the downside remained limited due to underlying
hopes of monetary easing, the stagnant economic growth will weigh on share
prices. Mr Kazuo Tamayama, director at Yasuda Kasai Brinson Investment
Management, said prices would not be affected by political developments,
since the political changes were following the shifts in the economic and
financial structures.
Reports on the political situation had little effect on movements in
individual shares. Mitsubishi Kasei, the most active issue of the day, moved
ahead Y12 to Y530 on its development of an anti-Aids drug.
Nippon Express, which was also actively traded, rose Y50 to Y1,070. The
company, which has close links to Japan Railway, gained ground ahead of JR
East's listing, scheduled for October. Reports of listing plans for DDI, a
new telecom company, encouraged trading in its leading shareholders. Ushio
climbed Y82 to Y982 and Kyocera appreciated Y160 to Y6,460.
Some financial issues were lower on arbitrage-linked selling. Industrial
Bank of Japan weakened Y40 to Y3,200 and Mitsubishi Bank retreated Y30 to
Y2,850. Profit-taking depressed mining issues, taking the sector down 1.99
per cent. Sumitomo Metal Mining dipped Y10 to Y1,060.
In Osaka, the OSE average relinquished 16.30 to 22,363.56 in volume of 24.9m
shares. Nintendo, the video game maker, gained Y290 at Y9,600.
Roundup
POLITICAL events provided the key to developments in several Pacific Rim
markets.
PAKISTAN was higher in brisk trade after Mr Ghulam Ishaq Khan, the
president, and Mr Nawaz Sharif, the prime minister, resigned, ending months
of political uncertainty. The KSE index rose 9.24 to 1,280.74.
Mr Kaikobad Kakalia, senior equities trader at BMA Capital Management in
Karachi, said investors had taken heart at the smooth transition of power to
the new caretaker premier, Mr Moeen Qureshi, a former vice-president of the
World Bank.
'He is regarded as a respected international economist and people feel that
the economy will be in safe hands,' added Mr Kakalia.
HONG KONG saw across the board selling by overseas institutions. There was
news over the weekend that the Shanghai Petrochemical flotation had received
a tepid reception, and the institutions were unsettled by reports that
China's Guangdong province may slow its property investment in the colony
and that local property developers were pulling out of projects in China as
austerity measures begin to bite.
The Hang Seng index fell 111.50, or 1.6 per cent, to 6,813.72 in turnover of
HKDollars 3.2bn, after Friday's HKDollars 2.6bn. The property sector, 2.7
per cent lower, bore the brunt of the selling pressure.
AUSTRALIA recouped much of its early loss to close only slightly down on the
day. Firm oil and gas shares also helped to offset weakness, and the All
Ordinaries index finished only 3.6 off at 1,796.2.
TAIWAN was mixed, with industrials up on a minor technical rebound, while
banking stocks remained weak. The weighted index closed 7.32 higher at
3,917.81 in thin turnover of TDollars 10.55bn.
MANILA's composite index put on 6.64 at 1,621.70, boosted by the strength of
second line issues. SEOUL was easier in slow trading on fears that
protracted labour disputes at Hyundai subsidiaries would worsen. The
composite index dipped 9.79 to 749.38.
KUALA LUMPUR extended Friday's gains but closed off the day's highs. The
composite index moved up 6.72 to 742.50 on demand from institutional and
retail investors after Malayan Banking further cut its base lending rate.
BANGKOK picked up after last week's five straight days of losses. The SET
index rallied 13.55 to 898.91.

FT  20 JUL 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar loses in ERM respite
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHANIE FLANDERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN currency markets were surprisingly quiet yesterday morning after
last week's tensions, casting an unwelcome spotlight on the dollar, writes
Stephanie Flanders.
Although few in the market think that the ERM's troubles are at an end,
yesterday saw many traders unwind short positions adopted in the previous
week, as the immediate danger to existing parities seemed to ease.
Both the French franc and the Danish krone firmed somewhat as a result,
while the dollar's reduced attractiveness as a safe haven currency led the
American unit to fall sharply over the course of the day.
Part of the reason for the more relaxed mood in European markets was the
Bundesbank's two-day currency pact, which was interpreted as a sign that
official German rates will continue their slow but steady fall in the near
future. Many traders, whether or not they agree with this view, are at least
waiting to see this week's German monetary growth figures before staking
much more on possible currency realignments.
The French franc gained steadily during the day, closing in London at
FFr3.407 against the D-Mark, up from Friday's FFr3.418. The recovery in the
Danish krone was even more striking, the currency ending around DKr3.8560
per D-Mark, up from Friday's DKr3.8885 and comfortably above its ERM floor
of DKr3.9016.
In spite of the fall-off in speculative pressure, the Danish central bank is
expected to maintain the policy for defending the currency which it adopted
last week.
Yesterday it increased its 18-day liquidity rate to 20 per cent. The Danish
authorities plan to demand a similar 17-day rate this morning.
The dollar weakened considerably, ending in London nearly two pfennigs lower
against the D-Mark and almost 2 cents down on sterling. At the close of
London trading, the US currency stood at DM1.7055, and Dollars 1.4985
against sterling, compared to the previous DM1.7245 and Dollars 1.4790. In
New York the dollar closed at DM1.7086, with sterling at Dollars 1.4988.
Some traders said that the dollar weakening was due to the markets looking
less charitably at America's tentative economic recovery and continued
balance of payments weakness, as demand for a safe haven currency was
considered less necessary. Many will be waiting for Mr Alan Greenspan, the
chairman of the Federal Reserve, to testify before Congress today and on
Thursday about current US economic prospects.
Sterling gained ground against the D-Mark as well as the dollar. The UK
currency finished at DM2.5550, following Friday's close of DM2.5500.
A number of dealers attributed the rise to lowered expectations of speedy UK
interest rate cuts, although they warned that political uncertainties over
the next few weeks may reverse some of the pound's recent gains.

FT  20 JUL 93 / Money Markets: Sterling futures fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHANIE FLANDERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRADING IN sterling futures yesterday took the brunt of increased market
pessimism about future UK interest rate cuts, writes Stephanie Flanders.
The drop in all sterling future contracts ranged from 6 to 10 basis points,
and occurred early in the day's trading. The September contract fell by 7
points from Friday, closing at 94.11. There was a further slight narrowing
in the margin between September and December sterling, with the later
contract losing 10 basis points to finish at 94.29.
Many dealers suggested that hopes of an early fall in interest rates were
now indef-initely on hold. This, they said, could be put down to a mixture
of the political uncertainty surrounding the ratification of the Maastricht
treaty and the upcoming Christchurch by-election, as well as market
speculation that Friday's UK GDP figures for the second quarter may show
strong growth.
At the shorter end of the UK money market, traders were pleasantly surprised
by a smaller than forecast shortage of Pounds 450m, later revised to Pounds
350m. Most of this was removed in the early round by the Bank of England.
Over-night rates began quite tight in anticipation of a much larger
shortage, but ended at 3 per cent after trading at around 5 1/4 per cent.
Elsewhere in European money markets, trading was considerably more subdued
than in recent days. The Bundesbank's announcement of an unusual two-day
currency pact early on Monday led German call money rates to rise from the
very low levels reached on Friday. D-Mark overnight rates closed at around
7.15 per cent, up 5 basis points from Friday's levels.
The German central bank explained the two-day pact as a way to drain the
excess liquidity created by Wednesday's tender round. At the same time, many
dealers concluded that the German authorities were signalling a repo rate of
7.15 per cent in this week's pact, announced later this morning. This would
be 13 basis points below the rate set at last week's tender. According to
many traders, that would pave the way for a discount rate cut at next week's
July 29 Bundesbank council meeting.
The German move helped to ease pressure on French money market rates, with
three-month money closing in Paris at 7.30 per cent, down more than 20 basis
points.

THE WORLD'S oceans can no longer sustain the demands for fish made on them
by a hungry and growing world population, according to a new report by an
international think tank.
Analysts at the Worldwatch Institute cite decreasing global supplies of fish
as one element in an emerging scarcity of sources of protein. Harvests of
two other important sources of protein - soyabeans and meat - increased
slightly in 1992, but failed to keep up with world population growth.
Global fish catches decreased from 100m tonnes in 1989 to 97m tonnes in 1990
and have remained close to that level. The amount of fish harvested per head
of world population has declined 8 per cent since 1988.
The 1992 soyabean harvest set a world record, yielding nearly 114m tonnes,
but like fish, the output per person has declined. Almost all of the 1992
crop came from the US, Brazil, Argentina and China.
Growth in world meat supplies has fallen below its traditional pace since
1990, which Worldwatch analysts interpret as an indication of the increasing
difficulty of expanding production of grass-eating livestock. Declines in
meat production, concentrated in eastern Europe, the former Soviet Union and
the European Community, were offset by modest production increases in China
and the US.
News of world grain supplies was relatively brighter as stocks on hand at
the start of the 1993 harvest were up 19m tonnes from 1992 to a level
sufficient to feed the world for 73 days. Analysts noted, however, that
increases in global stocks masked regional decreases such as that in
southern Africa, where drought caused sharply lower maize harvest.
The report also found decreasing world use of fertiliser, largely because of
the removal of subsidies for their purchase in eastern Europe and the former
Soviet Union.
The study found capacity to generate power with wind continued to grow in
1992, while nuclear power capacity was at a virtual standstill.
Cigarette smoking held steady from 1991 to 1992 breaking a trend of almost
uninterrupted growth since the end of World War II, the study found.

FT  20 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Processors cash in on EC aid
for pea production - Growers will get little benefit from area payments /
Farmer's Viewpoint
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID RICHARDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TO PEA or not to pea; that is the question. Indeed, it is a question UK
growers of green peas for freezing ask themselves every year. For few crops
create as much aggravation on the farm or generate as much emotion between
growers and processors. And by introducing area aid payments for all peas,
whether grown for animal protein or human consumption, the European
Community's common agricultural policy reform package has created yet
another area for conflict.
While area aid for cereals, oil seeds and dry peas and the like was
introduced to compensate growers for cuts in guaranteed prices, the area
payment for green, or vining, peas did not replace anything. It was simply a
bonus of about Pounds 140 an acre, which must have slipped past
Euro-officials who failed to understand its significance.
Moreover, vining pea growers said last autumn that they would prefer not to
receive the aid. Instinctively they realised that it would complicate their
negotiations with the processors and that in the long run they would be
better off without it. But the wheels of government grind exceeding slow and
since it had been agreed it had to stand, for 1993 at least.
But the situation was complicated further when it was decreed that, in order
to be eligible to claim the aid for crops grown in 1993, a farmer had to
have been committed to growing green peas by November 17 1992. In other
words, the farmers in question had to have a cropping plan or a contract to
grow verifiable as having been written before the due date. Any farmer worth
his salt would have planned his cropping long before that and most decided
to claim the aid.
Cynics will say, of course, that farmers will claim any grant that is going
given half a chance. But the deciding factor this time was the declared
intention of the processors to grab at least some of the benefit for
themselves. Any farmer who did not claim therefore stood to receive worse
terms for his peas as well as missing EC aid payments.
The processors negotiated long and hard to secure the discounted deals they
wanted. Some have cut the prices they will pay for a tonne of peas; others
have extended payment terms; and at least one big processor has said it will
spend the money gained on extra brand promotion. But all have made sure that
the growers will not hang on to all the EC cash to which they are, however
anomalously, entitled. Indeed some processors were still negotiating terms
until well into last month, when this year's harvest began.
This expensive, 24-hours-a-day, usually co-operative operation, is now about
half done. It goes on, rain or shine, across the pea-growing areas, most of
which are in the eastern counties of England, for six or seven weeks. It
involves massive Pounds 150,000 vining machines, which separate peas from
pods, and fleets of lorries to take the peas to freezing factories. Strict
time limits are set for the peas to be delivered, processed and frozen.
After more than 90 minutes out of the pod they begin to deteriorate, so the
logistics must be meticulously planned and executed.
Given such restrictions it is necessary to have more than adequate man and
machine power available in case of breakdowns. All of which adds to the
expense and the management problems of the pea campaign. Even so the
procedure, carefully planned from staggered planting dates to orderly
harvesting, can go wrong. The hot weather during Wimbledon fortnight, for
instance, caused many fields of peas to ripen prematurely and the capacity
of the viners was inadequate to deal with them all before some had
deteriorated below the high quality standards demanded by the processors.
The result was that some fields had to be passed over and left to be combine
harvested for seed or for feeding to livestock.
Farmers so affected can usually defray any losses they suffer against the
co-operative group to which they belong. But they are left with a harvest
for which they did not plan and with the cost and inconvenience of combining
and storing the dry peas until a market for them is found.
Peas crops that have been harvested green, as intended, are reported to have
turned in variable yields this year. Some growers in Lincolnshire and
Humberside have seen up to 2.5 tonnes an acre while some others in Norfolk
and Suffolk have been disappointed to achieve only 1.5 tonnes an acre. There
are few crops more weather-sensitive than peas.
At the higher end of that yield scale the crop can be reasonably profitable,
especially with the extra income from area aid. At the lower end growers
will almost certainly have made a thumping loss, even with the EC cash.
But profitability also depends on the contract each co-operating group has
with its processor. This year has seen a welcome and significant resurgence
of fixed price contracts, replacing some of the less secure market-related
deals that have characterised recent years. Indeed it was the move towards
market-related contracts and the threat of delayed payment until the goods
were retailed that finally persuaded me to get out of the green pea business
about 15 years ago.
Since then many other farmers have also stopped growing the crop and there
are probably fewer than 1,000 who have stuck with it, selling to 15 to 20
significant processors, themselves dominated by only three companies. It
might be thought that farmers serving such a compact industry would be able
to work together for mutual benefit. But apart from voluntarily agreeing to
cut the acreage this year by about 20 per cent in order to clear last year's
stocks there seems to be a sad lack of unanimity among growers, especially
on contract terms and prices.
Whether or not they agree to work more closely together, however, there will
be no area aid from the EC next year and in order for a farmer to even equal
this year's income per tonne the processors will have to raise prices
significantly.
Furthermore farmers will need to know the terms under which they can grow
peas far earlier than ever before to be able to plan their 1994 acreage
set-aside by the deadline date of the December 15 1993. In most years
negotiations have hardly begun by then because, the processors say, they
cannot decide acreages or prices until they know carry-over stock levels.
And that depends on the severity of the winter and the availability and
price of fresh vegetables through January, February and March.
How that little difficulty will be solved is anybody's guess. Brussels-based
bureaucrats do not make provision for the peculiarities of the British
climate nor for the Machiavellian complications of corporate negotiations
with farmers. I confess to being rather pleased that I am no longer involved
in that particular can of worms.

Renewed tightness for September COPPER in the afternoon on the LME helped
the three-month price to rally smartly back above Dollars 1,900 a tonne,
erasing early losses to close steady. Business in the other base metals was
largely subdued, said dealers, as the summer run-down in trade interest
exercised its usual dampening impact on activity. Chicago SOYABEAN prices
were boosted by concerns over production following USDA Secretary Mike
Espy's statement last Friday that 20m acres of US crop land had been
affected by the Mississippi-Missouri flooding. Chicago WHEAT futures jumped
on the strong soyabean surge, with independent strength coming from worries
about cuts in US wheat production, traders said. New York COTTON prices
soared by almost the 2 cent limit in early trading on prospects of a drop in
Chinese production, as well as in sympathy with soaring soyabean prices and
dry weather concerns in the south-east. GOLD edged ahead on the London
bullion market. Dealers said the tone remained bullish, citing last week's
support at Dollars 390 a troy ounce despite almost flat US inflation data.

FT  20 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Cocoa pact goes for output
management
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE NEW International Cocoa Agreement, adopted late on Friday after more
than a year of negotiations, is the first United Nations commodity pact to
make production management its cornerstone.
Instead of focusing on short-term price stabilisation, through buffer stock
operations or export quotas, the accord aims to shore up prices in the long
term by limiting supply and promoting consumption.
Unlike producer cartels such as the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting
Countries, the cocoa accord brings consumer countries on to the production
management committee, which will set the parameters for and monitor
compliance with supply targets. However, producers alone will be responsible
for drawing up and implementing supply curbs.
Mr Kouame N'Guessan, spokesman for the producers, said on Friday that
producers finally had their destiny within their hands. All prices were
obtainable provided producers made the necessary sacrifices and showed
discipline.
Mr Alain Gauze, commodities minister for the Ivory Coast, pledged his
country's support for a well-co-ordinated production policy to raise prices.
The Ivory Coast, which accounts for a third of total world exports, has
already taken steps in the past two years to keep cocoa off the market but
stocks of an estimated 1.4m tonnes have continued to depress prices.
The production committee will fix 'indicative figures for annual levels of
global production necessary to achieve and maintain equilibrium' in the
cocoa market, in the light of forecasts for world production and
consumption, the agreement says.
The accord also establishes a consumption committee to promote cocoa use and
calls on importing members to 'remove or reduce substantially' domestic
taxes and import tariffs that deter consumption.
Mr N'Guessan warned on Friday that a proposed harmonisation of EC standards
on cocoa butter substitutes in production of chocolate could, in some
circumstances, cut cocoa use in the community by some 200,000 tonnes a year.
This would run counter to the efforts of producing countries to solve the
problem of oversupply, he said.
The new accord will come into force when ratified by at least five exporting
countries accounting for at least 80 per cent of total exports and by
importing countries representing at least 60 per cent of total imports. The
current 1986 agreement is due to expire at the end of September.
Its 40 members account for three-quarters of world production and
consumption. Among producers, Malaysia, responsible for 10 per cent of world
production, and Indonesia are not members, nor is the biggest consumer, the
US, which accounts for a quarter of world imports. All three countries took
part in the Geneva negotiations.

FT  20 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: State companies slip in
non-fuel mine output league
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SHARE OF western world non-fuels mineral production accounted for by
state-owned mining companies is falling - not via privatisation but because
of lack of investment.
This is one of the main conclusions reached by the Raw Material Group of
Sweden when compiling data for the latest edition of Who Owns Who in the
Mining Industry.
Although programmes to sell state-controlled mining companies have started
in, among others, Argentina, Bolivia, Nicaragua and Peru, these had not seen
any substantial capacity sold to the private sector by the end of 1992.
RMG says the few privatisations included the Canadian asbestos producer,
Societe Nationale de l'Amiante; Peru's Empresa Mineral del Hierro Peru and
the Condestable mine in that country.
'But even if the privatisation programmes had not yet had their full impact,
the state share of western world production fell in 1991. This was primarily
because of diminishing production levels in some state controlled mining
companies where there was a lack of replacement investments,' says RMG. It
points to Zaire as an example. Gecamines and other Zaire state mining
companies dropped from eighth to 15th place in the list of the western
world's top 50 mining groups.
Anglo American Corporation of South Africa is the world's most important
mining company, according to RMG, which drew up its league table by
reference to the value of non-fuels minerals production controlled by each
company in 1991.
By this measurement, Anglo is nearly twice as big as its closest rival, RTZ
Corporation of the UK. RMG admits, however: 'RTZ can claim to be the world's
largest mining company using many other criteria'. RMG's method of
assessment naturally gives most weight to production of high-value metals
and minerals such as gold and diamonds. Gold production controlled by Anglo
rose by 2 per cent to 410 tonnes between 1990 and 1991 while RMG counts De
Beers, one of the world's biggest diamond producers, as an integral part of
the Anglo group, not a separate mining company even though it is quoted
separately.
Similarly, RTZ's 49-per-cent-owned associate in Australia, CRA, is
considered by RMG as part of the UK group.
RGM points out that the fastest-growing big mining companies between 1990
and 1991 were Broken Hill Proprietary, Australia's biggest company, MIM
Holdings, another Australian group, and Freeport-McMoRan of the US.
BHP increased its share of western world non-fuels minerals output from 1.5
per cent to 2.1 per cent, mainly because of the huge growth in copper
production from its partly-owned Escondida mine in Chile. MIM moved from
13th to 8th in the league table after it doubled its shareholding in
Cominco, the Canadian zinc producer and because of increased output from its
joint-ventured Porgera gold mine in Papua New Guinea. Freeport-McMoRan saw
the value of its output rise by about one quarter because of increased
production from its Indonesian copper-gold mine.
If the proposed merger between Cyprus Minerals and Amax of the US goes
through, the combined group would become one of the ten or 12 biggest
western mining companies, depending on which of their core assets are
included in the deal.

FT  20 JUL 93 / Government Bonds: French sector steady despite worries over
ERM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN and KAREN ZAGOR
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DOOM-LADEN predictions about the end of the European exchange rate mechanism
refused to die down yesterday but the French government bond market, which
is close to the centre of those predictions, was surprisingly steady.
The Notionnel 10-year bond future for September opened at 120.32, edged some
20 centimes higher in the morning and then drifted back to close unchanged.
The French franc continued under pressure against the D-Mark but the
government bond market shrugged off currency tensions.
Traders said that inflationary pressures were so low that the debt market
would remain attractive for some time. They said that international
investors concerned about the currency would hedge against further falls by
buying D-Marks rather than selling French bonds.
The brief rise in mid-morning came after the German Bundesbank announced a
surprise two-day reverse repo at 7.15 per cent, down from the current repo
rate of 7.28 per cent.
Against the usual trend, the German central bank bought D-Marks in order to
drain money from the system following the heavy franc/D-Mark speculation of
recent days and sold currency, probably dollars.
GERMAN bunds traded slightly easier yesterday with some switching into
domestic public authority bonds. The Liffe bund futures contract for
September fell by 0.03 to 96.23.
RECENT attacks on the Danish krone left their mark on Danish government
bonds, which fell at the 10 and five-year level. The yield on 8 per cent
government stock dated 2003 rose to 7.16 per cent from 7.03 per cent while
the yield on the 8 per cent bond due 1998 rose to 7.18 per cent from 6.8 per
cent.
Mr Jonathan Davis of UBS said: 'It is a fairly hefty increase but the
fundamentals are good and the only thing holding back the performance is the
concern of currency hedging.'
IN THE UK, investors shunted along the yield curve to avoid concerns hanging
over the short end and middle reaches. Short-dated prices fell as traders
responded to a raft of stories in the weekend press highlighting the signs
of economic recovery and the consequent fading chance of a cut in base
rates.
Meanwhile, the market shunned five to eight-year maturities ahead of the
announcement of the precise details (due today) of the next big gilts
auction set for July 28.
The Bank of England said on Friday that it will auction an unspecified
amount of stock maturing between 1998 and 2001.
Dealers were loth to be left with gilts maturing between those dates on
their hands ahead of a supply boost, which is forecast to be some Pounds
3.25bn.
JAPANESE government bonds traded in London consolidated following a strong
performance in Tokyo dealing.
The prospect of near-term political uncertainty following Sunday's election
was overshadowed by hopes of a cut in the 2 1/4 per cent official discount
rate. The yield on the JGB No 145 fell from 4.24 to 4.23 per cent in Tokyo
but picked up slightly in London.
US TREASURY prices were narrowly mixed in the absence of market-moving news.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond recovered from its
morning losses to edge  1/32 higher to 107 19/32 , yielding 6.538 per cent.
At the short end of the market, the two-year note was off  1/32 , to yield
3.972 per cent.
Treasuries started to slide after oil prices rose on news that Opec has
scheduled a meeting for later this month. The news triggered futures-led
selling in the bond market.
Overall, market sentiment remains cautious ahead of today's release of June
housing starts and the beginning of Federal Reserve chairman Alan
Greenspan's Humphrey-Hawkins testimony before the House Banking Committee.
The Federal Reserve entered the open market to arrange three-day system
repurchase agreements when Fed Funds were trading at 3 3/16 per cent,
slightly above the perceived target for the rate of 3 per cent. The move,
which adds reserves to the banking system, was widely expected. Fed funds
closed at 3 1/8 per cent.

FT  20 JUL 93 / International Capital Markets: Knock-out equity warrant
offers make a comeback
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HIGHLY structured equity-linked transactions seem to be making a comeback in
the Eurobond markets, with obvious advantages to issuers and some quirky
appeal to investors.
Most recently, Swiss Bank Corporation launched a L200bn bond and 'knock-out'
equity warrants deal for Benetton, the Italian clothing manufacturer and
retailer. The issue, which has characteristics similar to the warrants
offering the bank put together in March for Roche, the Swiss drug company,
gives investors the fixed-income return of a bond and limited equity
exposure to Benetton's share price.
The issue allowed Benetton to borrow at better rates than conventional
bonds, and the warrants dilute the equity to a lesser extent than a regular
convertible bond.
Investors liked the deal because the cash flows from the bonds can be
readily swapped, and the warrants could be either purchased separately or
stripped from the bond. The deal offered money managers high-quality
exposure to the Italian stock market, since the warrants acted like
synthetic shares.
However, because the cap feature of the warrants limits their potential
returns, most investors would prefer to buy Benetton shares outright. The
warrants are aimed squarely at Swiss and German buyers, who find the
after-tax returns from the warrants are higher than for a straight bond.
The Benetton warrants were priced at 96 per cent of the share price, at
L17,983. Investors will participate in share price appreciation up to, but
no higher than, L29,873.
On the downside, investors are guaranteed a maturity price of no less than
L21,543. However, the downside 'put' is conditional. If the share price
rallies above the L24,353 'knock-out' price during the three-year life of
the warrants, put protection disappears. Warrant exercise is possible only
on the maturity date.
If the Roche deal is any indication, Benetton's warrant purchasers had
better prepare for a knock-out. Roche shares hit their knock-out level of
SFr5,000 two weeks ago, forcing investors to either trade out of the
warrants, buy their own puts on Roche shares, or accept unlimited downside
share price risk.
Traders estimate that Benetton's borrowing costs in the deal will amount to
5 to 6 per cent, while investors will harvest a 10 to 12 per cent annual
return in lira terms, modest compared to a flat Libor yield of about 10.5
per cent.
Mr Andrea Mandel-Mantello of SBC said future knock-out warrant deals will be
limited. 'Only companies that are extremely confident of their potential
share performance will venture into these vehicles,' he said. Also,
successful issuers must be well-known internationally and have high-quality
credit.

FT  20 JUL 93 / International Bonds: Aggressive terms for World Bank L300bn
deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE WORLD BANK tapped the Eurolira sector of the international bond market
yesterday, issuing L300bn of 10-year bonds on what were seen as
characteristically aggressive terms.
The bonds have a coupon of 9.45 per cent and yielded 9.47 per cent at full
fees (a price of 99.875). By comparison, one dealer pointed to OKB, the
Austrian state-backed financial institution, whose 9.5 per cent 10-year
Eurolira bonds were trading to yield 9.55 per cent.
'The (World Bank) deal is quite aggressive, but it is going well,' said one
participating bank, reporting interest from retail and institutional
investors in Germany, the Benelux countries and Switzerland.
Another banker said: 'It is priced on the tight side, so it won't rush away,
but it will get done.' The bonds were quoted at 99.90 - 99.95 by
mid-afternoon.
New issue activity in the international bond market appeared to have slowed
down yesterday, with only a clutch of deals.
The dragon bond market, regarded by many as still being in its infancy, saw
a further development with the launch of the first Canadian dollar deal
targeted at Far Eastern investors.
Canada's Export Development Corporation launched a CDollars 250m, five-year
dragon bond issue with a yield spread of 29 basis points over the Canadian
government benchmark, giving a yield of 6.74 per cent.
'The borrower has a requirement for Canadian dollars. It was sounding out
the Eurobond market, then decided to raise its profile in the Far East with
a dragon bond issue,' said Mr Andrew Ferguson, deputy managing director of
Wardley Capital Limited, which was book-runner for the deal.
The bonds were sold mostly in Hong Kong, although there was some buying
interest from Singapore and Korea. Participating banks noted good demand and
described the deal as fairly priced.
Latin American names continued to tap the international bond market. Banco
Nacional de Comercio Exterior, the Mexican state-run foreign trade
development bank, is issuing Dollars 200m of 10-year notes as trustee for a
special purpose Mexican business trust called Huites Trust. The financing is
intended to help pay for the construction of a dam and hydro-electricity
facility in Mexico.
The bonds will be priced to yield around 230 basis points over the US
Treasury bond. Lehman Brothers, the book-runner, said the pricing is in line
with that on Bancomext's recent Yankee bond issue, a seven-year deal
yielding 215 basis points over the US Treasury bond.

<TEXT>
BANCO Santander, the Spanish bank, has launched a Pta13.5bn issue of
mortgage-backed bonds in the Spanish market, the first under Spain's new
securitisation law which has clarified tax problems facing issuers of
mortgage-backed debt.
Banco Santander had already issued two mortgage-backed deals under the
previous law, using a different structure.
The bonds have a semi-annual coupon of 10 1/4 per cent and mature on June 30
2010, but are expected to have an average life of 5.7 years. The mortgage
loans represent 47.15 per cent of the current value of the properties on
which they are secured.
The bonds are rated AA by Iberating, Standard &amp; Poor's Spanish subsidiary.

ROCKWELL International, the California-based high technology group,
yesterday reported a 20 per cent increase in third-quarter net income and
forecast that full-year earnings per share would be at least 15 per cent
higher than last year.
The group reported net income of Dollars 147.2m, or 66 cents a share,
compared with Dollars 122.6m, or 55 cents, in the same period of last year.
Sales rose from Dollars 2.7bn to Dollars 2.8bn.
Mr Donald Beall, chairman, said third-quarter figures were ahead of the
company's expectations, with three of its four business units reporting
substantial earnings increases - aerospace and automotive were each up 38
per cent while electronics, the group's largest business, was up 28 per
cent.
The fourth, graphics, had a loss, due to 'continued depressed worldwide
newspaper printing press markets'. The company said, however, that it was
beginning to see signs of an upturn in demand for large newspaper presses.
For the first nine months, net income was Dollars 411.9m, or Dollars 1.87 a
share, up 19 per cent over the Dollars 344.9m, or Dollars 1.54, reported the
previous year prior to accounting changes.
Mr Beall said the third-quarter figures demonstrated performance
improvements through company-wide initiatives in 'progressive management
practices'. Aerospace's return on sales was up 3 percentage points, while
electronics and automotive were up almost 2 percentage points.

expectations

<TEXT>
ELI LILLY, the US pharmaceuticals group which went through a shake-up of top
management last month, has reported a 6 per cent advance in sales for the
second quarter of 1993, compared with the same period a year earlier,
confounding the more gloomy market predictions.
Net income rose to Dollars 346.8m, or Dollars 1.18 a share, from Dollars
340.2m, or Dollars 1.16. The result was ahead of market expectations, though
still below the Dollars 1.23 a share achieved in the first quarter of this
year.
Sales totalled Dollars 1.56bn, compared with Dollars 1.48bn in the second
quarter of 1992, led by growth in international markets. The rise came in
spite of moves by Germany to contain spending on drugs, the company said.
Pharmaceutical sales in the US were dampened by the effects of Medicaid
rebates, the growth of institutional buying of drugs through managed-care
programmes, and continued competition in anti-infective drugs.
Lilly has been hit by concern over its failure to produce new big-selling
drugs, which contributed to the resignation last month of Mr Vaughn Bryson,
chief executive.
Spending on research and development rose to Dollars 470m in the second
quarter, up 11 per cent on a year earlier. The company said this reflected
'the increased number of compounds that are entering the final phases of
clinical research'.
Before the effect of accounting changes, net income for the first half fell
by Dollars 102m, to just over Dollars 1bn, pushing earnings per share down
from Dollars 2.66 to Dollars 2.45.
However, after accounting changes, earnings rose from Dollars 2.26 to
Dollars 2.42 a share.

FT  20 JUL 93 / International Company News: Whirlpool surges 39% to Dollars
74m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHIRLPOOL, the world's biggest maker of large home appliances, yesterday
reported a 39 per cent leap in second-quarter net earnings, helped by higher
unit shipments and cost-containment efforts.
The company reported net earnings of Dollars 74m, or Dollars 1.04 a share,
against Dollars 53m, or 75 cents, in the same period of last year on
revenues which rose 4 per cent from Dollars 1.83m to Dollars 1.91bn.
Mr David Whitwam, chairman, said the quarterly earnings and unit shipments
and sales were the company's best ever. 'Our emphasis on productivity
improvement and cost containment continues to produce outstanding operating
leverage,' he added.
In North America, the company said revenues and earnings both ran well ahead
of 1992 performance. Industry shipments of the nine most important home
appliances were up around 2 per cent in the quarter and were expected to be
up around 3 per cent for all of 1993.
In Europe, the company's unit shipments rose despite a comparatively weak
industry performance and the continent's recession. Operating margins
improved, helped by lower selling and administrative expenses and a 'notable
year-over-year improvement within the subsidiary's compressor operations'.
Whirlpool expected European industry shipments for 1993 to be off about 2
per cent from 1992.
Other overseas operations saw revenues nearly double, though planned selling
and administrative expenses for expansion in Asia contributed to a drop in
operating profits.
For the first six months, Whirlpool suffered a net loss of Dollars 88m, or
Dollars 1.23 a share, compared with net earnings of Dollars 88m, or Dollars
1.25, in 1992.
However, 1993's first-quarter figures were affected by two special charges,
without which first-half earnings would have totalled Dollars 132m, or
Dollars 1.85 a share.

BARITO Pacific Timber's planned Dollars 250m flotation suffered a setback
yesterday when Salomon Brothers, the US merchant bank, withdrew as lead
foreign underwriter.
Barito, Indonesia's largest integrated timber producer, accounts for 16 per
cent of the world plywood market. Gross profits last year totalled Rp230m
(Dollars 113m) on sales of Rp769m.
The flotation, consisting of 10 per cent of the company, is expected to
value Barito Pacific Timber at about Dollars 2.5bn.
Salomon Bros would not comment, but one banker said the decision resulted
from Barito's failure to provide information which 'a reasonable investor
would expect to see in the prospectus'.
An official close to Barito said Indonesian regulations limiting corporate
disclosure may have resulted in Salomon having insufficient information to
satisfy US regulatory authorities.
Brokers said the flotation would proceed, although Makindo Securities, the
Indonesian broking house lead-managing the issue, may find it harder to
attract foreign investors.
Crosby Securities, which specialises in Asian markets, and Schroders, the UK
investment bank, were still supporting the flotation, brokers said. Several
broking houses, including Wardley James Capel, have published 'subscribe'
notes to clients. The issue has been dogged by bad publicity since it was
formally announced two weeks ago.

KIRIN Brewery, Japan's largest brewer, said its chairman and two other
executives would step down after last week's arrests of four company
employees, suspected of paying up to Y33m (Dollars 308,411) to sokaiya, or
racketeers.
Mr Hideyo Motoyama, chairman, Mr Teruchika Ishii, vice-president, and
another executive will resign at the end of this month.
The payments are believed to have started after a shareholders' meeting in
1983, which lasted five hours due to questions from the racketeers.
The company said it would cut bonus payments for Mr Keisaku Manabe, company
president, by 30 per cent, and by 15 per cent for Mr Yasushi Yamamoto,
vice-president. Other board members face a 15 per cent cut.
Kirin suspended all beer advertisements last week 'for the time being',
saying it was wrong to publicise its products at the same time as
apologising for the scandal.

MCGRAW-HILL, the US-based publishing and information services group,
yesterday reported 17.3 per cent rise in second-quarter net income, buoyed
by a jump in profits at Standard &amp; Poor's, the credit rating agency.
McGraw-Hill reported net income of Dollars 43.18m, or 88 cents a share, up
from Dollars 36.79m, or 75 cents, in the same period of last year, on
revenues which rose 1.4 per cent to Dollars 490.9m.
The group's financial services business produced a 25.1 per cent increase in
operating income on a 14.5 per cent rise in revenue, thanks to Standard &amp;
Poor's, which continued to benefit from new issues volume in the US and
international securities markets.
The JJ Kenny business also showed 'fine growth' as investments in technology
led to productivity gains.
Information and publication services saw an 8.2 per cent drop in revenue and
a 20.6 per cent fall in operating profits. Advertising at Business Week
magazine fell 16 per cent in April and May, and did not begin to regain
momentum until June.
Educational and professional publishing suffered a Dollars 2.1m drop in
operating profits, and broadcasting was down 12.7 per cent.
However, the group's share of the MacMillan/McGraw-Hill School Publishing
Company's profits rose 72.4 per cent, to Dollars 11.2m.
Mr Joseph Dionne, chairman, said that the slow growth of the US economy
would mean a 'challenging second half for some of our businesses,
particularly in advertising and construction. But continued growth in
financial services from new financing, new products and global expansion
should keep us moving ahead'.
For the first half the company reported income up 18.9 per cent at Dollars
58.43m on revenues 2 per cent ahead at Dollars 957.8m. Earnings per share
were Dollars 1.19, against Dollars 1.00.

BARITO Pacific Timber's planned Dollars 250m flotation suffered a setback
yesterday with the withdrawal of Salomon Brothers, the US merchant bank, as
lead foreign underwriter.
Barito is Indonesia's largest integrated timber producer, accounting for 16
per cent of the world plywood market. Its gross profits last year totalled
Rp230m (Dollars 113m) on sales of Rp769m.
The flotation, consisting of 10 per cent of the company, is expected to
value Barito Pacific Timber at about Dollars 2.5bn.
Salomon Bros had been asked to co-ordinate and place shares with foreign
financial institutions not represented in Indonesia. Salomon Bros would not
comment on its withdrawal but the decision resulted from Barito's failure to
provide information which 'a reasonable investor would expect to see in the
prospectus', explained one banker.
An official close to Barito said Indonesian regulations limiting corporate
disclosure may have resulted in Salomon Bros having insufficient information
to satisfy US regulatory authorities.
Barito executives have begun a two-week road show to publicise the flotation
which will take in London today, then Scotland, the US, Japan, Hong Kong and
Singapore. Brokers said the flotation would proceed, although Makindo
Securities, the Indonesian broking house lead-managing the issue, may find
it harder to attract foreign investors.
Crosby Securities, which specialises in Asian markets, and Schroders, the UK
investment bank, were still supporting the flotation, brokers said. Several
broking houses, including Wardley James Capel, have published subscribe
notes to clients.
The issue has been dogged by bad publicity since it was formally announced
two weeks ago. Barito executives denied a document, allegedly compiled by
government officials, which named the Barito Pacific Group as one of 26
companies in arrears on state bank loans last December.
Government officials have refused to confirm or deny the document's
authenticity.
Executives of Barito Pacific Timber said the company's debt was Dollars 584m
at the end of last year and they have letters from the state banks
confirming that all Barito Pacific Group subsidiaries were fully servicing
their loans.
The Barito Pacific Group has more than 100 timber, petrochemical,
agribusiness and financial services subsidiaries and a turnover of about
Dollars 2.5bn. Mr Prajogo Pangestu, chairman of Barito Pacific Group,
declined to give a figure for total group borrowings.
'I know exactly how big our loan exposure is but I cannot disclose it to the
public,' said Mr Pangestu, who explained the figure was subject to
Indonesia's bank secrecy laws.
Last week, Mr Pangestu was summoned to parliament after announcing that
Taspen, the largest state pension fund, took a 20 per cent stake in Barito
Pacific Timber for Rp375bn last February.
The government has said it would review the transaction, along with all of
Taspen's investments in private companies. Mr Pangestu defended the deal
which he said followed all necessary procedures.

FT  20 JUL 93 / International Company News: Consortium to advise on NSC
privatisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A consortium has been formed to advise on the forthcoming privatisation of
National Steel Corporation, the largest steel producer in the Philippines.
It will include Beddows &amp; Company, the international consulting firm, which
is teaming up with financial advisers Barclays de Zoete Wedd and All Asia
Capital. They expect to complete a study by early September recommending the
method of privatisation.
The privatisation of NSC is an important part of President Fidel Ramos'
programme to eliminate state presence in business, and is aimed at
positioning the company to take advantage of growth in steel demand in
south-east Asia.
The government said last month it expected to generate 10bn pesos (Dollars
377.3m) from the sale of NSC. The proceeds would be used to settle NSC's
maturing debts and help finance the establishment of an integrated steel
plant, expected to cost at least Dollars 1.9bn.
NSC has been modernising and upgrading its facilities. But it still relies
on imported slabs to make hot strip and tin mill products.
An integrated steel plant would allow the company to reduce its dependence
on imports, and cut the Philippines' foreign exchange bill.

FT  20 JUL 93 / International Company News: Techint instigates a 30-year-old
plan - The Argentine group's expansion strategy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Techint, the Argentine steel-to-oil group, is using the country's
enthusiastic embrace of privatisation and free market economics to press
ahead with plans first hatched in the 1950s.
For three decades, interference by the government and the army frustrated
its ambitions to grow into a big, integrated steel maker. But the new
economic climate has enabled Techint to forge ahead with an expansionist
strategy in a highly competitive steel market.
Acting through Siderca, its seamless pipe unit, Techint last month took
management control of Tubos de Acero de Mexico (Tamsa), a Mexican steel pipe
maker it helped set up in 1954.
It paid Dollars 67m cash to increase its stake to 24 per cent when the
loss-making company made a rights issue.
Latin America's small equity markets and family-owned private companies make
takeovers such as this rare. Techint was able to take control of Tamsa
because of its unusually dispersed shareholding and New York stock exchange
listing.
The trend to mergers and takeovers should increase as more Latin companies
are forced to go public to raise capital.
Techint has wasted no time laying its plans for Tamsa.
A Techint executive said: 'We will work on the obvious synergies.'
Each company makes different types of steel pipes, which are used in the oil
drilling industry, so there is little danger of competing in overlapping
markets.
Siderca has a strong international sales network and will offer a wider
range of products. It will be able to advance more easily into the Mexican
and North American markets.
The two companies have a combined share of about 20 per cent of the world
market for seamless piping, although a group of four Japanese companies led
by Sumitomo has a dominant 40 per cent share.
Techint is setting up a joint venture with Confab, Brazil's biggest maker of
welded pipes, to share the cost of overseas sales networks and broaden
product ranges.
However, Techint is preparing for a long hard slog. Tamsa and Siderca export
more than 80 per cent of output, but the trading outlook is cloudy. Demand
in the former Soviet Union, a big market for Siderca, has slumped, drilling
in the rest of the world is down and competition is getting ever tougher.
On one level, Argentina's privatisation programme could make life less
comfortable for Siderca.
YPF, the oil group which is Siderca's biggest local client, threatens to
become more choosy in placing orders now that it has moved into the private
sector.
However, Techint hopes Tamsa and Siderca, supported by stronger balance
sheets, will be able to hold their own in the international market.
Within two or three years, says a Siderca executive, 'there will be fewer
companies and we expect to be among the winners. The others do not have the
excellence, the management or technology to continue in this very
competitive market.'
Brave words, but Siderca has been going through hard times. It lost Dollars
98.7m in its last financial year following a decline of a third in output.
Like many other large Argentine companies, Siderca is part of a closely-held
family-dominated holding company. This shields management from the
short-term outlook of minority shareholders, but Techint's murky inner
workings make it hard to monitor strategic progress.
The takeover of Tamsa follows Techint's acquisition of Somisa, a steelmaker,
when it was privatised last year. Techint led a consortium that paid Dollars
140m for 60 per cent of the company, renamed Aceros Parana.
Techint then absorbed Aceros Parana into its Propulsora steel plant,
allowing it to fulfil its long-held ambition of becoming a fully-integrated
steel maker.
In the 1970s, the army blocked Techint's plan to build a steel mill to
compete with Somisa, the military-controlled steel company.
However, Techint is still facing competition from recession-bound Brazilian
companies and as a result, Propulsora lost Dollars 2.8m in the first half of
this financial year. Fortunately for Techint, the government has imposed
countervailing duties on Brazilian steel imports.
As in pipes, Techint has forged international alliances to strengthen its
steel business.
Its allies in the Aceros Parana privatisation were CAP, the Chilean
steelmaker; Usiminas, Brazil's privatised steel mill and CVRD, the Brazilian
state-owned iron ore producer.
Little more than a decade ago, the military would have vetoed alliances with
Chile and Brazil, Argentina's bitter rivals, in a strategic industry such as
steel, as a threat to national security.
Today, both companies and governments see cross-border alliances and
takeovers as a key to survival.

FT  20 JUL 93 / International Company News: Directors at Kirin to resign
over payments

KIRIN Brewery, Japan's largest brewer, said its chairman and two other
executives would step down after last week's arrests of four company
employees, suspected of paying up to Y33m (Dollars 308,411) to sokaiya, or
racketeers.
Mr Hideyo Motoyama, Kirin's chairman, Mr Teruchika Ishii, vice-president,
and another executive will resign at the end of this month.
Last October, Mr Masatoshi Ito, the president of Ito-Yokado, a leading
retailer, was forced to resign after three Ito-Yokado officials were
arrested for payments of Y27m to sokaiya.
Kirin's payments to gangsters are believed to have started after a
shareholders' meeting in 1983, which lasted five hours due to questions from
the racketeers.
The company said it would cut bonus payments for Mr Keisaku Manabe, company
president, by 30 per cent, and by 15 per cent for Mr Yasushi Yamamoto,
vice-president. Other board members face a 15 per cent cut.
Kirin suspended all beer advertisements last week. The company said the
suspension would last 'for the time being' saying it was wrong for the
company to actively publicise its products at the same time as apologising
for the scandal.
Kirin has acquired 50 per cent of Hiljo, the Dutch flower-exporting
subsidiary of Finnish state-owned chemicals group, Kemira.
The Japanese brewer has taken an option to acquire the remainder of Hiljo,
which has annual turnover of about Dollars 35m, at a later date. No price
was announced.
Faber Group has entered into a joint venture with Granton International,
part of the Sheraton International group, to develop a hotel and a
commercial complex in Kuala Lumpur, Reuter reports. Faber will take up 51
per cent of the venture company, Inter-Heritage.

FT  20 JUL 93 / International Company News: Unisys overcomes sluggish market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
UNISYS, the US computer manufacturer, increased operating profits in the
second quarter, in spite of sluggish market conditions which reduced sales.
Net income for the quarter was Dollars 103m, or 39 cents a share, fully
diluted.
This compares with last year's Dollars 88.4m, or 35 cents, before a tax
benefit, which raised income to Dollars 105.4m or 45 cents per share.
The average number of fully diluted shares in the latest quarter was 198.6m,
against 167.8m a year ago.
The increase reflects the issue of Dollars 345m of 8.25 per cent convertible
subordinated notes in June 1992.
Revenue for the quarter was Dollars 1.93bn, down from Dollars 2.09bn in the
same period last year.
'Profitability has improved year to year despite increased economic weakness
in Europe and Japan,' said Mr James Unruh, chairman and chief executive.
'Further improvement in gross profit margins coupled with continued
reduction in operating expenses has resulted in an operating profit margin
of 11.3 per cent, the highest in five years,' he added.
Unisys would 'retain tight cost and expense controls to deal with the
uncertain economic environment and continue to focus on revenue
opportunities with good margins', Mr Unruh said.
Unisys said its debt, net of cash, stood at Dollars 1.4bn at the end of the
second quarter.
The company's debt-to-capital ratio fell to below 37 per cent, compared with
a high of 61 per cent two years ago.
Unisys's credit rating has recently been upgraded by both Moody's and Duff
and Phelps, the credit rating agencies.
The company said that declines in sales of hardware in Europe and Japan were
partly compensated for by growth in revenues from software, services and
systems integration.
European orders and revenues were also negatively affected by currency
translation, the company added.
At the half-way stage, net income was Dollars 363.6m or Dollars 1.48 a
share, including a net gain from one-time items in the first quarter of
Dollars 203.8m, or 83 cents a fully-diluted share.
In the same period last year net income was Dollars 153.7m, or 56 cents a
share, including Dollars 17m or 10 cents a share, from the tax benefit.
Revenues were Dollars 3.83bn, against Dollars 4.1bn for the first six months
of 1992.

FT  20 JUL 93 / International Company News: Boost for Travelers' shares as
profits show advance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES in Travelers, the US insurance group hampered by a Dollars 5bn
portfolio of property loans, jumped by Dollars 2 3/8 yesterday before
settling back to close at Dollars 31 3/8 , a rise on the day of Dollars 1
3/8 , on news that profits had advanced strongly in the second quarter of
the year. Operating profits reached Dollars 94m, compared with Dollars 72m
in the first three months of the year and Dollars 58m in the second quarter
of 1992.
After a net investment loss of Dollars 1m (compared with gains of Dollars 8m
in the same period a year earlier), after-tax income reached Dollars 93m, or
55 cents a share, against Dollars 66m, or 59 cents, a year earlier.
The fall in earnings per share follows the issue of new shares last year to
the financial services group Primerica, which now holds 27 per cent of the
company.
Strong gains in managed care, personal property/casualty insurance and
financial services drove the advance, helped by cost-cutting and a
concentration on higher-margin business. Operating profits in the managed
care and employee benefits area rose to Dollars 26m, from Dollars 18m the
year before, while personal property and casualty insurance returned Dollars
21m, up from Dollars 13m. Operating profits from financial services more
than doubled, from Dollars 9m to Dollars 20m.
'Travelers' restructuring activities are resulting in stronger core
businesses which are providing improved products and better service at
significantly lower cost,' said Mr Edward Budd, chairman.
Commercial property and casualty insurance suffered a decline at the
operating level, from Dollars 42m to Dollars 38m, as price competition
remained fierce and the fall in interest rates hit investment income.
Under-performing property investments led to an operating loss of Dollars 5m
(unchanged from the year before) on asset management and pension services.
The bond market rally helped to push up unrealised profits on the company's
bond portfolio by Dollars 132m to Dollars 1.3bn during the quarter.

PRIMERICA, the financial services group built by Mr Sanford Weill into the
second-biggest stockbroker in the US, yesterday reported second-quarter net
income of Dollars 186.4m, up from Dollars 149.6m a year earlier.
This was achieved on the back of continuing heavy stock market investment by
retail investors across the US.
The figures were also bolstered by the inclusion of a Dollars 25.3m
contribution from its 27 per cent stake in Travelers, the insurance group,
acquired last September.
The group's Smith Barney broking subsidiary, which is due to complete the
takeover of stockbroker Shearson from American Express at the end of this
month, turned in record earnings of Dollars 57.7m. This was up from Dollars
42.4m in the same period in 1992 and just ahead of the Dollars 57.5m of the
first quarter.
Commission income from trading was up by a quarter on a year earlier, at
Dollars 145m, though it had fallen slightly from the peak of the first three
months of this year.
The takeover of Shearson had been delayed for operational reasons until the
end of this month, and the absorption of the broker was continuing without
problems, Primerica said.
Stripping out the contribution from Travelers and other interest, net income
from continuing operations was Dollars 161.1m, up from Dollars 144.9m the
year before.
A marked fall in loan-losses helped the group's consumer financial services
division to turn in net income of Dollars 51.3m, up from Dollars 47.5m. The
rate of write-offs fell to 2.34 per cent, from 2.86 per cent a year before.
Income from insurance services was down at Dollars 60m from Dollars 64.7m,
due to a charge of Dollars 4m to reflect a minority interest and flat sales
of life insurance products at Primerica FInancial Services.
'We couldn't be more pleased with our company's performance,' said Mr Weill.
The group had extended its debt profile, taking to 70 per cent the
proportion of debts which are long-term and giving it greater flexibility to
finance further growth, he added.
Earnings per share advanced to Dollars 1.02, from 90 cents in the same
quarter in 1992, but down from the first quarter's Dollars 1.03 a share.

taken up

   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRONTLINE, a Swedish shipping group, said yesterday it had placed new shares
worth SKr420m (Dollars 58.3m) with a range of international investors to
dispel uncertainty arising from its ownership structure and to bolster it
against further weakness in world shipping markets.
The group said the issue of 20m shares, which represented 46 per cent of the
company's stock, was fully taken up by about 20 pension funds and other
institutions in Norway, the UK and the US.
The issue, handled by Fearnley Fonds of Norway, was priced at SKr21 per
share. This compared with a buying price of SKr23 and a selling price of
SKr29 on the Stockholm stock exchange just before the placement was
announced.
Frontline said no other shipping company was involved in the placement. The
company had been the subject of some takeover speculation as two leading
shareholders have signalled they will soon sell out their stakes.
One, a Swedish wage-earners fund soon to be disbanded, held 30 per cent of
Frontline before the new issue, and the second, Bilspedition, a Swedish
transport group, held 10 per cent.
Mr Kjell Jonson, the chief executive, said the share issue guaranteed that
Frontline would be able to ride out any credit problems that might arise if
shipping markets remained weak for the next three or four years.
Frontline, with a fleet of about 20 ships, has invested heavily in the past
two years in so-called OBO 170,000-tonne combined bulk/liquid carriers. It
said it had pre-tax losses in the first six months of SKr120m after
depreciation costs of SKr135m.

<TEXT>
INLAND Steel Industries of Chicago yesterday posted its best quarterly
results in almost three years during the second quarter, and issued a
bullish forecast, Reuter reports from Chicago.
'We are confident that Inland will return to profitability during the second
half of the year,' said Mr Robert Darnall, chairman.
Of the improved quarterly results, Mr Darnall said: 'We are finally
beginning to see the tangible benefits of our turnround strategy.
'Our new facilities are progressing toward their design capabilities and our
cost-reduction efforts are on target. Although new orders have slowed a bit
in recent weeks, steel shipments this year will show their greatest
year-over-year increase since 1983,' Mr Darnall added.
Inland recorded a second-quarter net loss of Dollars 2.5m, or 30 cents a
share, compared with a year-ago net loss Dollars 8.5m, or 53 cents.
Sales advanced to Dollars 996m from Dollars 909m in the 1992 period.
The company said both of its business segments posted improved operating
results. Inland Steel Co achieved an operating profit for the second
consecutive quarter, while Inland Materials Distribution Group doubled its
operating profit from the year-earlier period.
I/N Kote, Inland's newest joint venture with Nippon Steel of Japan, advanced
on schedule and operated at 86 per cent of capacity during June, the company
said.
Mr Darnall said that the US International Trade Commission was scheduled to
rule this month on the final phase of the industry's trade cases against
imports of 'dumped' and subsidised steel from 20 countries.
'If that ruling is favourable, as we expect, it will significantly reduce
the flow of unfairly traded steel coming into this country and provide a
more stable environment for the company and our employees,' he added.

FT  20 JUL 93 / International Company News: Marriott opens Dollars 1.5bn
offer to swap bonds
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MARRIOTT Corporation, the large US lodging and food services group,
yesterday announced the start of its offer to exchange Dollars 1.525bn of
existing bonds for new high yielding debt securities, common stock and cash.
The offer stems from Marriott's plan to demerge its main operating interests
 -the lodging business and food services operations, to be known as Marriott
International - from its property assets and the bulk of the group's debts,
in a business to be known as Host Marriott.
The demerger plan sent the value of Marriott's bonds plunging and angered
its bondholders, who pressured the company into the exchange offer.
However, some investors, led by a subsidiary of the UK's Prudential
insurance group, are pursuing court action against Marriott for alleged
fraud in connection with the demerger.
The demerger will be considered by Marriott shareholders at the company's
annual meeting this Friday.
Consummation of the exchange offer - which runs until August 17, but can be
extended - is dependent on shareholders approving the demerger.
Deere &amp; Co, the US farm equipment group, filed a shelf registration with the
Securities and Exchange Commission for up to Dollars 350m of debt and
equity, Reuter reports.
The offering may consist of debt securities, preferred stock, depositary
shares, common stock, warrants to buy debt securities, currency and other
warrants.
Net proceeds will be used for working capital and other general corporate
purposes.

   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE NEW owners of the privatised Mexican television stations and cinema
chain have announced plans to take their media company public within 12
months in an offering on the New York Stock Exchange.
Mr Ricardo Salinas Pliego, president of Radiotelevisora del Centro, said the
offering would be up to 49 per cent, the maximum permitted under the
privatisation.
Mr Salinas also said he would be taking his family's Grupo Elektra public on
the NYSE at the end of this year or beginning of next, probably offering
about 20 per cent of the capital.
Radiotelevisora bid 2bn pesos (Dollars 641m) for state-owned Channels 7 and
13, 126 cinemas, and a local television station. The bid was 30 per cent
higher than the next best offer. The company offered about Dollars 500m for
the television stations, and Dollars 140m for the cinemas, Mr Salinas said.
Grupo Elektra is Mexico's largest electrical retailer, with about 275 stores
throughout the country. Mr Salinas said he believed the company was worth at
least 15 times earnings, or Dollars 600m.
Mr Salinas will use the proceeds from the two offerings to pay off an
18-month bridge loan taken on to finance the purchase of the media package.
Mr Salinas was confident his new company could survive alongside Televisa,
which has about 90 per cent of the Mexican television market.

UPJOHN, the US pharmaceutical company, yesterday reported a 4 per cent rise
in second-quarter sales to Dollars 915m and an 8 per cent improvement in
operating income.
Net income for the three months to June 30 was Dollars 125.3m, or 70 cents a
primary share, against Dollars 123.9m, or 69 cents, a year earlier.
Operating income rose to Dollars 163.2m in the 1993 quarter, against Dollars
151.6m.
Sales of Halcion, Upjohn's controversial sleeping pill which has been banned
in the UK, rose slightly in the second quarter. In the first quarter
Halcion's worldwide sales dropped nearly 29 per cent, to about Dollars 10m.
The Kalamazoo, Michigan-based company is looking to new products to replace
several important drugs which are losing their patents.
Three of Upjohn's most important products - Halcion, Xanax and Micronase -
will face generic competition next year. Ansaid, a non-steroidal
anti-inflammatory, has already lost its patent.
In the US, second-quarter sales of healthcare products grew 16 per cent,
with new products contributing more than 7 per cent of domestic sales.
Incentives to consumers helped lift sales of Rogaine, Upjohn's hair-loss
treatment. Outside the US, healthcare sales rose 11 per cent in the quarter.
Agricultural sales, however, fell 32 per cent in the three months. The
company blamed recent changes to calendar-year from fiscal-year accounting
for the decline, although weak corn sales in the US hurt seed sales.
Reductions in soyabean acreage in Italy were reflected in declining sales
overseas.
For the first half of 1993, net income rose to Dollars 269.9m, or Dollars
1.51, from Dollars 38.6m, or 19 cents. In the first half of 1992, Upjohn
took charges of Dollars 222.9m for accounting changes, compared with charges
of Dollars 7.8m in the first half of this year.
Operating income advanced more than 5 per cent to Dollars 347.3m from
Dollars 329.2m. Sales rose 5 per cent to Dollars 1.85bn.

HF AHMANSON, the US thrift holding company, is selling Dollars 1.2bn of
delinquent, non-accruing single-family real estate loans, and will add
Dollars 163m to reserves for certain real estate development projects, AP-DJ
reports from Irwindale, California.
The loans are being sold to a subsidiary of Bear Stearns. Ahmanson said it
planned to raise about Dollars 200m of additional capital to position itself
for expansion.
Mr Richard Deihl, chairman and chief executive, said the company 'expects to
see the earnings benefits of these actions in the third quarter'.
He added that, by selling the delinquent loans in a bulk sale, the company
benefited by reducing future losses and replacing these non-performing
assets with earning assets.
As a result of the sale and addition to reserves for property development
projects, the company expects a loss of about Dollars 290m for the second
quarter and a loss for the year.
In the second quarter last year, Ahmanson earned Dollars 67.1m, or 54 cents
a share.
It expects to be profitable in the third and fourth quarters.
The sale will reduce the ratio of non-performing assets to total assets to
about 2.04 per cent from 5.02 per cent at its peak last year. The ratio of
reserves to non-performing loans will rise to about 129.3 per cent from 27.8
per cent at March 31.

SALOMON'S Phibro Energy offshoot plans to invest about Dollars 200m in a
residual fuel oil upgrading project for its two refineries in Texas, Reuter
reports from Houston.
Completion of this project, expected by the end of the first quarter of
1996, will allow the Texas City and Houston refineries to produce more than
a 90 per cent yield of high value transportation fuels while processing high
sulphur heavy feedstocks, Phibro said.
As part of this project, Phibro agreed to buy Dow Chemical's 200,000 barrel
per day Oyster Creek refinery in Freeport, Texas, and will dismantle and
remove all the equipment. Much of this will be used in the upgrading
project.

FT  20 JUL 93 / International Company News: Fee commissions help lift BBV

BANCO BILBAO Vizcaya, the Spanish retail bank which has a large industrial
portfolio, yesterday reported first-half net profits of Pta44.6bn (Dollars
327m), a 6.4 per cent increase on the first six months of last year.
The result was achieved despite a 26.5 per cent drop in extraordinary income
through disposals.
The strong performance was based on a sharp increase in fee commissions,
which included income earned in currency operations and trading in Spanish
government debt, a market in which BBV is a large participant.
The BBV group, which has aggressively recovered non-performing loans, pushed
its operating profits, based on financial products, up by 16.4 per cent to
Pta53.9 per cent. The bank raised its net provisions by 28.7 per cent to
Pta25.5bn.
Banco de Santander, the Spanish banking group, yesterday launched a
Pta13.5bn mortgage securitisation bond, the first of its kind in Spain. The
instrument, which will have an average life of 5.6 years, carries a 10.25
per cent coupon, paid every six months, and is open to both institutional
investors and the retail market.
In May Santander, which has a low mortgage market quota, broke into the
sector when it offered sharp rate cuts to home buyers with an offer of
12-year mortgages at 11.50 per cent.

FT  20 JUL 93 / International Company News: Status of France Telecom to be
changed

MR GERARD Longuet, the French minister for industry, post and
telecommunications, yesterday announced plans to transform the state
telephone company, France Telecom, into a joint stock company with majority
state control.
A statement from the industry ministry said that the change in status could
help the company expand internationally and forge alliances with
international telecom companies.
The move is also designed to prepare France Telecom for the liberalisation
of the European telecoms market due to take place on January 1 1998.
Telecoms analysts said Mr Longuet's decision partly reflected concerns that
France Telecom had failed to clinch an alliance with MCI, the US telecoms
company. France Telecom and Deutsche Bundespost Telekom, its German
counterpart, lost out to the privatised British Telecom which bought a 20
per cent stake in the US company last month.
'It was a failure to lose MCI,' Mr Longuet said in an interview with Les
Echos, the French financial daily, earlier this month. 'We were beaten to
the post by BT.'
Mr Longuet has also expressed his belief that Deutsche Bundespost Telekom is
'a natural partner on the European continent'.
Mr Marcel Roulet, president of France Telecom, has indicated in several
statements since the beginning of this month that he foresees crossholdings
with the German telecommunications operator once the statutes of France
Telecom have been changed.
Until 1991, France Telecom was an 'administration', or a branch of the
government. It then changed to become an 'autonomous operator under public
law'.
The process of changing the status of France Telecom, which will require
legislation, is expected to take several months.
