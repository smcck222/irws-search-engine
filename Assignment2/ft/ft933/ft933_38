FT  20 JUL 93 / International Company News: GEC-Alsthom ahead 8.5%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
GEC-ALSTHOM, the Anglo-French power and transport company, increased its net
profits 8.5 per cent to Ecu318m (Dollars 359.34m) in the year to the end of
March 1993.
The group, formed in 1989 as a 50-50 joint venture between the UK's GEC and
Alcatel Alsthom of France, achieved the result on sales of Ecu7.98bn, an
increase of 6 per cent over the same period last year.
The improved profits reflected the strength of the principal business
activities - power generation and distribution and transport.
'These areas have been very resilient in the face of Europe's recession and
we have also enjoyed strong exports elsewhere,' the company said.
In the power generation division - which provides the bulk of the group's
revenues - the main sources of income were large power station projects in
Asia and Europe.
The results included revenues from a Dollars 600m contract in the
Netherlands to build a combined cycle gas turbine power station, which uses
both steam and gas. GEC-Alsthom has also seen strong demand for coal-fired
power stations in eastern Germany.
Transport operations, best known for the TGV, the high speed train, also saw
increased orders. The results to the end of March benefited from the
contract to supply rolling stock to the Paris-Brussels-Cologne-Amsterdam
high speed rail line and from a contract to supply standard rolling stock
for the Channel tunnel.

FT  20 JUL 93 / International Company News: Pinault-Printemps considers
stake sale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORE THAN 10 per cent of the shares of Pinault-Printemps, the French
retailing group, may be sold in a public offer, the company said yesterday.
In a prospectus Societe Alsacienne de Magasins, a subsidiary of
Pinault-Printemps, said it planned to sell at least half of the 2.9m shares
 -about 22 per cent of the total - it holds in its parent company.
According to Samag, the shares are being sold to increase the number of
Pinault shares in public hands. The move is also necessary under French
company law which requires the disposal of Samag's stake in
Pinault-Printemps within one year of the merger between Pinault and
Printemps, completed in December last year.
The sale of Samag's holding, which is conditional on market conditions, is
through an offer on the Paris stock market and a private placing for
international investors. The international tranche, to be placed by BZW, the
merchant bank, will be subject to a 15 per cent clawback if the domestic
portion is oversubscribed.
Mr Francois Pinault, Pinault-Printemps chairman, and the other members of
the Pinault family together control about 39.6 per cent of the capital of
the group and just over 50 per cent of the voting rights.
The family holding intends to take up sufficient shares in the tender to
keep its stake unchanged.

FT  20 JUL 93 / International Company News: McDonnell Douglas beats fall in
civilian business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
McDONNELL Douglas, the US defence and aerospace group, yesterday reported a
strong improvement in second-quarter earnings, despite the sharp global
downturn in the civil aviation business.
Mr Herb Lanese, chief financial officer, said the company was 'tracking very
well' to exceed Wall Street's expectations of Dollars 9.30 a share in
earnings from operations for 1993. McDonnell Douglas shares rose Dollars 2
to Dollars 74 in early trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
The company reported net earnings of Dollars 170m, or Dollars 4.33 a share,
compared with Dollars 11m, or 29 cents, in the same period of last year,
even though revenues dipped from Dollars 4.8bn to Dollars 3.8bn. It was
helped by Dollars 57m, or Dollars 1.46, of unusual gains from settlement of
a tax issue and a change in retirement health care funding, but the company
said that even without this help, earnings of Dollars 113m were a
second-quarter record.
McDonnell Douglas, which has been financially stretched for the past few
years, also substantially improved its balance sheet, with the indebtedness
of its aerospace operations dropping to Dollars 2.34bn, compared with
Dollars 2.77bn at the end of 1992, while the debt to equity ratio dipped to
0.75 from 1.01.
The increase in earnings was powered by Dollars 100m of profits from the
missiles, space and electronics segment, compared with Dollars 37m in the
same period of last year.
The military aircraft business produced Dollars 122m, up from Dollars 46m a
year ago, when the company took a Dollars 34m write-off.
The programme to develop the C-17 military transport, which has been dogged
by financial and other problems, broke even in the first half and Mr Lanese
said it was expected to be profitable in the second half.
The civil aircraft business produced second-quarter earnings of Dollars 14m,
up from Dollars 6m a year ago, despite a 37 per cent reduction in revenues,
reflecting reduced aircraft deliveries.
For the six months, McDonnell Douglas reported net earnings of Dollars 386m,
or Dollars 9.84 a share, up from Dollars 35m, or 91 cents, in 1992,
excluding the effect of an accounting change last year. First-half earnings
from operations were Dollars 5.28 a share.

FT  20 JUL 93 / International Company News: Awaiting life in an altered
state - The removal of uncertainty for Rhone-Poulenc
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Within the next 10 days, the French government is due to announce the names
of the first companies it plans to sell as part of its ambitious
privatisation programme. It is a reasonable bet that Rhone-Poulenc, one of
the world's 10 largest chemicals group, will be near the top of the list.
'Rhone-Poulenc and Elf (the state-owned oil company) are running neck and
neck,' said Mr Gerard Longuet, industry minister, recently.
A series of share placings, the most recent in January, has already reduced
the state's direct shareholding in Rhone-Poulenc to about 43 per cent, with
a further 20 per cent being held by state-controlled institutions. But for
investors already holding Rhone-Poulenc shares, and for potential investors
in France and elsewhere, the prospect of full privatisation focuses
attention on the group's prospects and how they might be affected by the
expected sale.
For Mr Jean-Pierre Tirouflet, Rhone-Poulenc finance director, the main
advantage of privatisation would be a removal of uncertainty. 'Since 1985 we
have been constantly told by the government that we will be privatised or we
will stay in the public sector. It is very difficult to lead a constant
financial policy or a normal relationship with shareholders with such
uncertainty and it impedes the ability of the company to finance itself on
the market.'
The problem takes two forms. On the one hand, shareholders must take account
not only of the company's management and strategy in evaluating
Rhone-Poulenc's stock, but also of the state's intentions and the
possibility that between FFr12bn (Dollars 2.04bn) and FFr15bn of new shares
may come on to the market following a sale of the government's stake. At the
same time, raising new capital through share issues is complicated by the
need to time the issues with the process of obtaining approval from the
government.
From a financial perspective, therefore, Mr Tirouflet has little doubt; 'the
sooner privatisation, the better'.
In another important respect, however, privatisation would involve greater
uncertainty. The sale of the government's stake would remove a stable
investor and raise the question of the future shareholding structure. The
solution, according to Mr Tirouflet, is the creation of a noyau dur, a core
of long-term shareholders to replace the state.
'We need strong shareholders on board with deep financial interests,' he
says. 'We would like them to be from different areas and ideally to include
an industrial company.'
In terms of the day-to-day running of the business, however, the company
believes life after privatisation will remain fairly constant. 'We have not
had uneconomical interference and have managed to change substantially while
being a state-owned company.'
This change has involved a far-reaching restructuring of the company since
Mr Jean-Rene Fourtou took over as chairman and chief executive in 1986. The
group has moved away from bulk chemicals and increased its presence in
higher value added markets such as pharmaceuticals. In 1990, for example,
Rhone-Poulenc merged its healthcare business with Rorer of the US, becoming
the world's tenth largest pharmaceuticals company.
Over the past five years, the group has spent about FFr40bn on acquisitions
and disposed of about 80 affiliated companies. Last year alone, the value of
disposals totalled more than FFr4bn.
The reorganisation is not finished, nor may it ever be. 'I don't think
stability is a target,' says Mr Tirouflet. 'You think you have the right
balance and then the markets change or you develop a new product and your
outlook is different.'
The restructuring of the specialty chemicals division is still not complete
and further consolidation is expected in the group's fibres activities. The
programme of disposals also continues apace. Earlier this month,
Rhone-Poulenc sold its 35 per cent stake in Roussel-Uclaf, the specialty
chemicals business, which will raise about FFr4.5bn. Last week, the group
announced it was cutting a quarter of the jobs at its French fibres
business.
The restructuring of the group has increased its resilience to difficult
market conditions, in particular the effects of European recession, the
sharp fall in prices for fibres such as nylon and polyester, the depressed
market for base chemicals and pressures on healthcare expenditure in some of
its principal markets. Last year, the group raised net profits by 23 per
cent to FFr1.52bn, albeit on the basis of modest earnings in 1991.
This year, the conditions facing the company remain difficult. 'The chemical
industry is in one of its most serious crises in recent history,' according
to Mr Tirouflet. The group's agricultural division is suffering from reduced
demand resulting from cuts in production arising from Europe's common
agricultural policy, while prices for fibre products continue to fall in
response to cheap imports from eastern Europe. In the first quarter of this
year, the group's sales of fibres in Europe fell by about 25 per cent.
Despite the economic environment, however, most analysts expect another
increase in profits this year. Mrs Catherine Leveu, chemicals analyst at
Cholet Dupont Credit Lyonnais, argues that the strength of the
pharmaceuticals business and reduced financial charges resulting from the
sharp reduction in French interest rates since the advent of the new
government in March, should enable the group to achieve net profits of about
FFr1.75bn this year with another increase in 1994.
How attractive this appears to investors will become clear after the green
light is given by the government. The main concern for the company is that
it is appealing enough to form a noyau dur to ease the upheaval of a move to
the private sector.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BANK OF East Asia has bought out SG Warburg's half interest in East Asia
Warburg, the Hong Kong joint venture merchant banking concern.
Warburg said proceeds received were 'very small' because the joint venture
had trimmed its concentration to corporate finance activities in Hong Kong.
Warburg will employ current staff of East Asia Warburg.
East Asia Warburg had been profitable since the venture was started up in
1982. However, because of the expansion of both parents around the region in
the intervening years, 'the two shareholders have concluded that while they
would work together when profitable opportunities to do so present
themselves, East Asia Warburg is no longer an appropriate vehicle for their
activities.'

FT  20 JUL 93 / UK Company News: NatWest in European link - Network likely
to work through each country's clearing system
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER and DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NATIONAL Westminster Bank, Commerzbank of Germany and Societe Generale of
France yesterday announced that they had signed agreements to develop joint
services including easier cross-border payments for corporate customers.
The banks, which disclosed earlier this year that they had entered talks,
said they were putting in place reciprocal arrangements to streamline
account opening procedures and grant local credit facilities at each partner
banks.
The banks are also working on a cross-border payments system for low value
payments. This is due to be launched early next year. NatWest said the
network was likely to work through each country's clearing system.
The announcement comes as European banks are developing links with each
other rather than buying branch networks. Royal Bank of Scotland and Banco
Santander have formed a cross-border payments system with two other banks.
Mr Martin Kohlhaussen, Commerzbank's chief executive, said the new
association would set 'a good example for a new form of co-operation between
major European banks.' He said he expected other banks to join the
association, stressing that this was not intended to be the 'core of a new
banking group' but rather 'a specific co-operation concentrating on
particular business areas.'
Lord Alexander, NatWest's chairman, said the initiative would 'cut through
much of the bureaucracy involved in establishing cross-border banking
relationships.'
The agreements follow from the failure of more ambitious plans for a link-up
between Credit Lyonnais, the large French state-owned bank whose logo
Commerzbank still carries.
Credit Lyonnais went on to buy majority control of BfG Bank, Germany's sixth
biggest bank, for DM1.2bn (Pounds 460m) last year.
Dresdner Bank, Germany's second largest bank, has forged a co-operation
agreement with Banque Nationale de Paris. Under the agreement, the two banks
will co-operate when expanding into third countries and will rely on each
other's domestic branch networks in France and Germany.
The plan is for the two banks to take 10 per cent shareholdings in each
other, depending on the outcome of plans to privatise the 70-per cent
state-owned BNP.

FT  20 JUL 93 / UK Company News: New openings behind Harry Ramsden's rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OPENING NEW branches helped Harry Ramsden's, the Yorkshire-based fish and
chip restaurant operator, increase interim pre-tax profits by 14 per cent,
from Pounds 77,000 to Pounds 88,000.
Turnover rose from Pounds 1m to Pounds 1.24m in the six months to March 28,
reflecting November's successful openings in Manchester and Tyneside.
The group last week opened a new outlet in Edinburgh and will operate from
one in Birmingham next month. It will then have nine branches, including one
in Hong Kong.
Mr John Barnes, chairman, said sales at the original restaurant at Guiseley,
near Leeds, were 18 per cent ahead of last year.
He was encouraged that opening new branches had increased, rather than
diminished, the attraction of the first restaurant, which opened 63 years
ago and has long been a shrine to lovers of fish and chips.
Harry Ramsden's was determined not to open more than 20 branches in the UK,
so as not to dilute the brand's image.
Mr Barnes said: 'There was a real sense of occasion in Edinburgh last week,
with people travelling from far afield, and we don't want to lose that.'
Nonetheless, more openings were planned next year, on a joint venture and
franchise basis.
Partners subscribe from 60 to 80 per cent of the investment in a new outlet,
share profits on the same basis, and pay royalties equivalent to 7 per cent
of turnover.
Internationally, the new restaurant in Hong Kong was the pilot for expansion
in the Pacific Rim. Although that had not yet moved into profit, sales were,
encouragingly, on a par with the UK restaurants.
A franchisee had been recruited in Singapore and negotiations were under way
in Australia. In the Middle East a site search by a partner was expected to
lead to an opening next year at Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.
Despite providing restaurants with uniformed waitresses and chandeliers, Mr
Barnes said expenditure per head in the UK averaged only Pounds 5 for fish
and chips, bread and butter and a large pot of tea. Take-away fish and chips
could be bought for Pounds 2.20, so the restaurants had continued to attract
customers even when spending was tight.
Apart from a successful branch at Heathrow Airport, the group's furthest
venture south in the UK will come in the spring, when it opens in Bristol.
Mr Barnes said he was looking at a site on the M25, but had yet to find a
partner.
The interim dividend is unchanged at 1p, utilising in full earnings per
share of 1p (0.9p).

FT  20 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Share price plunge greets UK Land
reconstruction
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE STOCK market expressed disquiet yesterday at the reconstruction plan
announced over the weekend by UK Land.
From last Friday's price of 30p the shares were marked down to 4p.
UKL said reconstruction would provide a 'sound financial base' from which it
could maximise revenues from the Elephant &amp; Castle shopping centre in
London, its main asset, and subsequently seek property acquisitions.
With a deficit of shareholders' funds at March 31 1992 of Pounds 31.9m, the
alternatives were insolvent liquidation, administration or receivership.
In addition to the capital reconstruction, backed by its secured banking
creditors, UKL is raising Pounds 256,000 to meet that expense through a
fully underwritten rights offer.
Every 22 existing ordinary shares will be consolidated into one ordinary of
5p and one deferred of 545p - the latter will later be cancelled.
A total of 5m new ordinaries, or 64.44 per cent of the new capital, will be
issued to creditors. Lloyds Bank will be issued 2m, a syndicate of banks
will get 2.35m in respect of their secured advances, and unsecured creditors
under a company voluntary arrangement will be issued 650,000.
An open offer of 2.56m shares at 10p each (33 per cent of the capital) will
be made to shareholders on the basis of 13-for-1. A holder with 1,100 shares
would receive 50 new shares from the consolidation and be able to subscribe
for 650.
Lloyds will also be allotted Pounds 250,000 of 10 per cent convertible
secured loan 2003, convertible into 1.84m shares, unless that pushed its
holding to more than 29.9 per cent of UKL voting capital.
The issued capital will be 7.76m shares, or 9.6m on a diluted basis. Mr
James Grace and Mr Christopher Woodhouse, who are sub-underwriters, will
join the board.
The existing facility from Bank of Scotland will be converted into a Pounds
9m term loan, repayable 1998-2003, and a Pounds 2.3m overdraft, reducing
over the five years to April 1988. Lloyds and the syndicate banks may
require Lillybrook, the underwriter, to purchase up to 2m shares of their
entitlement at 10p each. Lillybrook is controlled by Mr Colin Tett, chairman
of UKL.

<TEXT>
HERON International, the property and trading group hoping to finalise a
Pounds 1.4bn restructuring by the end of this month, has sold three
properties to Postel Investment Management for Pounds 62m.
The sale prices were above those assumed in Heron's business plan.
Mr Gerald Ronson, who will give up the chairmanship of Heron when the
restructuring goes through but will remain as chief executive, had told
creditors last month that over Pounds 150m of sales had been completed or
agreed in principle.
These sales were included in that number. The three properties are a 12-unit
retail warehouse park and two office blocks.
Earlier this month Postel, the UK's largest pension fund, announced a Pounds
120m rescue package for Greycoat, the property group.

<TEXT>
International Business Communications (Holdings), the publishing, conference
and training group, has been informed that Williams de Broe, its broker, has
agreed to acquire 4.48m shares in the company from certain of the group's
bankers.
The agreement follows the allotment of new ordinary shares to be issued

the consolidation of the existing ordinaries.
Of those shares, which will represent 11.5 per cent of the enlarged and
consolidated share capital, 4.28m have been placed with institutional and
other investors.
As a result of the acquisition and placing, the aggregate shareholding of
the banks will be reduced to 8 per cent.

FT  20 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Forte seeks buyer for Harvester chain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FORTE, the hotels group, confirmed yesterday that it had begun to seek
buyers for its Harvester restaurant chain.
If no suitable buyer is found by the autumn, the group might either extend
the brand, currently based predominantly in the south-east of England,
throughout the UK or put the business into a joint venture.
Forte is believed to be looking for a price in excess of the Pounds 120m
mentioned in some reports.
It is also thought to be interested in selling its stake in the UK Kentucky
Fried Chicken business.
This is run in a joint venture with Pepsico, which is seen as the most
likely buyer of the Forte stake.

FT  20 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Trinity pays Pounds 23m for 26 Argus titles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRINITY International, publisher of the Liverpool Daily Post and Echo, has
reached agreement to buy the 26 local newspapers of the Argus Press in a
deal worth Pounds 23m.
The agreement, which is subject to contract, due diligence and the
permission of the Department of Trade and Industry, takes Trinity into the
south of England newspaper market for the first time.
The Chester-based publisher owns local and regional newspapers in north-west
England, North Wales, Canada and the US and a year ago bought Scottish and
Universal Newspapers from Lonrho for Pounds 45m.
The purchase of the Argus titles, which includes newspapers such as the
South London Press and the Surrey Comet, will extend Trinity's geographical
spread. The Argus Press was owned by BET until 1988 when it formed part of a
Pounds 206m management buy-out.
There was intense competition for the papers and it is believed that a
consortium of Reed International and Emap may have bid more.
The Trinity bid was apparently preferred because it is much more likely to
get clearance under monopoly regulations.
In the 12 months to December 26 Trinity reported pre-tax profits ahead 27
per cent to Pounds 16.9m.
The company, which is planning to become one of the leading publishers of
local newspapers in the UK, has been turning itself into a more concentrated
media company. Last year it sold its paper and packaging division for Pounds
27m.

FT  20 JUL 93 / UK Company News: The shadow that hangs over Medeva -
Yesterday's slump in the pharmaceutical group's share price
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN A statement warning that profits will be Pounds 10m lower than City
expectations causes the market value of that company to halve, something has
clearly gone badly wrong.
When over 28m shares are traded in the process, it is clear that investors
have experienced a failure of confidence approaching epidemic proportions.
Yesterday Medeva, the niche pharmaceuticals company, suffered just such a
fate. The company said stock problems at IMS, its Californian subsidiary,
and a two-week closure at MD Pharmaceutical, another US company, to meet
Food and Drug Administration requirements would lower pre-tax profits for
1993 by Pounds 10m to about Pounds 45m, against Pounds 36m last year.
However, much more than the company's profits, the main casualty from
yesterday's dramatic sell-off was the confidence in the depth of management
that Medeva has been working so hard to cultivate.
Since it began its rapid rise six years ago, Medeva has attracted no
shortage of unbelievers.
Medeva was a drug company growing by acquisition rather than research and
development of new drugs, the sceptics said; it was following a strategy
that relied heavily on the purchase of drugs considered too small or too old
by the world's largest pharmaceutical companies; and it had a management
forged from an unusual alliance between an ex-chief executive of Glaxo, Mr
Bernard Taylor, and an astute, but little known, wheeler-dealing former
stockbroker, Mr Ian Gowrie-Smith.
This strategy had within six years built a company from almost nothing to a
market capitalisation on Friday of nearly Pounds 600m. And through various
acquired subsidiaries, it is waiting for FDA approvals for new drugs and new
presentations of existing drugs that have recently gone off patent that
could give a significant fillip to sales.
But the unconverted were taking yesterday's 100p share price fall to 116p as
proof that even if they were unable to put a finger on where the formula
would break down, they knew it was flawed.
Medeva was yesterday trying to stress the problem was one of control, not of
strategy. The group was aware that growth through acquisition could lead to
problems of financial and quality control. More professional operational
management had been appointed earlier this year in Europe and four weeks ago
in the US.
'We know what the problems (of growing through acquisition) are likely to
be,' Mr Taylor said. 'We did not succeed in pre-empting them in the US where
we made our appointments just a whisper too late.
'I believe the overall strategy is still sound and has not been undermined
by these two problems but there is an understanding that we have moved too
slowly.'
Better controls may have led to an earlier audit of IMS stocks held in the
warehouses of independent wholesalers in California. These had reached
double normal levels and were therefore exaggerating the company's sales.
The turmoil in the US health sector as the Clinton administration tries to
tackle the rising cost of health care, also appears to have forced hospitals
to buy lower value added cheaper products from the wholesalers.
What the market and investors are more concerned about, however, is that
yesterday's warning may not be the last of the bad news. With confidence in
management controls now dented, will Medeva do what Spring Ram, Hartstone
and Tiphook have done recently - make more than one trading statement,
analysts were asking yesterday.
If Medeva's only problem was poor controls it could face a rocky few months
and then begin to rebuild confidence with the help of a revived focus on
operational controls.
But Medeva faces a much more long term problem in the shape of the US Food
and Drug Administration.
Last year Fisons, the UK pharmaceutical company, ran into problems with the
FDA over the conditions of a plant in the UK.
These have mostly been ironed out. But the incident and similar actions with
Glaxo, over its advertising in the US, suggest the FDA is pressing more
aggressively for tighter controls.
Not surprisingly, perhaps, Mr Taylor agrees. 'The FDA is really flexing its
muscles at the moment and is not content with the standards of manufacture,'
he said.
While Medeva thinks it has rectified the problems, Mr Taylor has no idea
when the FDA will visit MD again, although it will be this year, and cannot
say when Medeva will know if its standards now reach the required level.
Until the FDA's position becomes clear, Medeva is likely to remain under a
shadow. But this and yesterday's price fall does not appear to have detered
some analysts.
While consternation was almost universal yesterday, Warburg for instance,
has lowered its earnings estimates - but maintained its buy recommendation.

based water and sewage company, is acquiring its third finance leasing
company as part of its ongoing treasury management programme.
The company announced yesterday that it had acquired JHSW Leasing (9), a
wholly owned subsidiary of J Henry Schroder Wagg. The company, to be renamed
Yorkshire Water Third Finance, has a portfolio of finance leases, with lease
rentals receivable of Pounds 65.5m.
The shares in JHSW have been purchased for Pounds 100 calculated by
reference to net asset value, and in addition certain of existing loan
facilities totalling some Pounds 30m, previously provided to the company by
Schroders, have been refinanced by Yorkshire Water. The purchase price and
refinancing came from existing borrowing facilities of Yorkshire Water.
Yorkshire said that it expects to earn a good rate of return on this
investment.

FT  20 JUL 93 / UK Company News: L&amp;G reports increased life and pension
business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LEGAL &amp; General, the life and general insurer, reported a strong increase in
new pension and life business in the first half of 1993, indicating recovery
after a sharp decline in new business at the same stage of last year.
Mr David Prosser, chief executive, said the figures reflected 'the gradual
emergence of the economy from recession and a more focused approach to the
management of our distribution channels.'
L&amp;G's distribution network of direct sales and tied agency sales forces has
contracted sharply since 1989 and has only just begun to stabilise.
The company was boosted by strong growth of income from single premiums in
the UK. Life business single premiums were sharply ahead at Pounds 150.3m,
of which Pounds 140.4m came from unitised with-profit bonds.
Single premium income from pensions rose 66 per cent to Pounds 335.8m.
Overseas single premiums rose by 50 per cent to Pounds 79.2m. Overall single
premium business increased 96 per cent to Pounds 99.6m.
With consumers still lacking confidence to make long-term financial
commitments, the growth of new annual business premium income was slower.
Premiums from UK life business rose 3 per cent to Pounds 38.1m in the first
six months of 1993, while income from UK pensions business remained level at
Pounds 34.7m.
Overseas annual business premium income amounted to Pounds 25.5m (Pounds
21m).

KLEINWORT Benson Investment Trusts has raised Pounds 28.2m for its recently
launched Emerging Markets Trust, exceeding the minimum target of Pounds 15m.
The placing two weeks ago brought in Pounds 13.6m, and a further Pounds
14.6m has come through the public offer.
Mr Simon White, managing director of KB Investment Trusts, said the level of
demand from private investors demonstrated that emerging markets have become
increasingly popular.
The trust has a simple structure of ordinary shares priced at 100p with one
warrant attached for every five shares. There is no wind-up date. Dealings
are expected to start on Thursday.

FT  20 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Sycamore in loss and rationalisation under
way
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
REPORTING a pre-tax loss of Pounds 3.78m for the half year to March 31,
directors of Sycamore Holdings conceded that the state of the business was
'far from satisfactory'.
However, a completely new senior management team is in place and since April
'we have been addressing energetically all of the major problems,' they
said.
The loss compared with a profit of Pounds 314,000 last time, and included a
one-off reduction in the carrying values of stock and work-in-progress of
Pounds 1.9m. Turnover expanded to Pounds 11.1m (Pounds 9.69m).
Warwill continued to incur large losses in the iron foundry operation.
Urgent action was planned which was expected to lead to a significant
exceptional deficit in the second half, somewhat exceeding the surplus
already realised on two disposals.
They were Ashworth Instrumentation for Pounds 1.47m, a premium of Pounds
1.27m over book value, and Ashworth Diecasting for Pounds 1.2m subject to a
retention of Pounds 75,000.
A rationalisation and cost reduction programme had been implemented,
including closure of the former head office in Derby and removal of 'an
unnecessary layer of divisional management'. Since March the number of
employees had been cut from 660 to 471, of which 94 went with the businesses
sold.
The two largest businesses, Ashworth Living, a maker of laboratory, hospital
and accommodation furniture, and Deanes Furniture (office systems), enjoy
good market bases and were capable of long term development once the group
was on a sounder footing.

FT  20 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Pilkington in Pounds 90m Italian purchase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PILKINGTON, the glass group, and Techint Finanziaria, its Italian-Argentine
parter, last night signed a L210bn (Pounds 90m) contract to buy Societa
Italiana Vetro, the Italian state-owned glass company being privatised.
The news came after the market closed with Pilkington shares up 1p at 132p.
The deal, foreshadowed for some weeks, is still subject to approval from the
European competition authorities. If that goes through, it would make
Pilkington a strong number two in Europe after Saint Gobain of France.
Mr Roger Leverton, Pilkington's chief executive, said the acquisition was in
line with the group's strategy of concentrating on developing 'its core
businesses in major markets'.
Mr Andrew Robb, finance director of Pilkington, said the Siv deal would give
Pilkington greater balance both in its business and geographically.
Siv's strength is in automotive glass while Pilkington's emphasis in Europe
is on architectural glass. Siv has a southern European bias, with plants in
Italy and Spain, whereas Pilkington's facilities are based in northern
Europe.
He said that the timing of the deal was dictated by the Italian
privatisation programme. Although the European automotive market is
currently depressed, he expected it would recover. Siv's plants were all
modern and it would be able to use Pilkington's advanced coatings.
Mr Robb said there was little customer overlap between Pilkington and Siv,
with one or two in common in Germany and the UK. Siv has two float glass
lines in Italy and a half share in a third line, and two automotive glass
processing plants in Italy with a third in Spain.
Pilkington's Pounds 45m share of the consideration will be funded from
existing bank facilities and since its share of Siv's underlying net asset
value of Pounds 130m is Pounds 65m, its balance sheet will be marginally
enhanced by the deal. Siv will be treated as an associate by Pilkington.
Siv made an operating profit of Pounds 10m on sales of Pounds 280m in 1992,
but incurred a Pounds 23m loss after exceptional charges partly relating to
the impending privatisation.
Pilkington and Techint's business plan envisages redundancies of 450 of the
4,000 workforce, numbers which have been shown to the unions.
The joint venture agreement provides for either side to buy the other out,
including provisions for change of ownership of either.

FT  20 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Fresh boardroom row erupts at Hoskins
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A BOARDROOM row has further delayed a plan by Mr Adam Page, founder of
Midsummer Leisure, to reverse some of his businesses into Hoskins Brewery,
one of Britain's smallest quoted brewers.
Completion of the deal to inject three Fatty Arbuckle theme bars into
Hoskins in return for 41 per cent of its equity, had already been postponed
three times because of calls for clarification from the Stock Exchange .
The acquisition, announced in May, has blown into a row over Stock Exchange
regulations and property valuation between Mr David Shaw, a director and MP,
and the rest of the Hoskins board. The Conservative MP for Dover was last
week removed from the company's board.
Hoskins said there had been 'a breakdown in the relationship between Mr Shaw
and the other directors of the company.'
Mr Robert Hoar, estates director of Hoskins, said yesterday: 'I am still
hopeful that the transaction will proceed to a successful conclusion.'
However, further delays were likely because Mr Shaw had written to the Stock
Exchange expressing concern that the accountants' report on the acquisition
was incomplete. He had also questioned the property valuation of the bars.
Hoskins said yesterday that 'an appropriate due diligence exercise is being
conducted into the business to be acquired, including an accountants' report
and an independent valuation.'
Under terms agreed in May, Hoskins would pay Pounds 4.2m in cash and shares
to buy the three freehold sites of the Fatty Arbuckle theme bars.
Mr Hoar, and his brother Barrie, chairman, would sell more than half their
30 per cent stake in Hoskins. Mr Barrie Hoar would resign, as would the
current financial director Mr Pankaj Shar.
This would leave Mr Page with 41 per cent of the enlarged share capital. He
would become the new chairman and chief executive, and bid 55p for the
remaining shares.

stake

WARBURG PINCUS has sold its 12.05 per cent holding of 4.38m ordinary shares
in Sterling Publishing and also its 91.3 per cent stake of 2.37m 8 per cent
convertible preference shares in the company.
In addition, Warburg Pincus has cut its stake from 97.2 per cent to 60.7 per
cent in Sterling's 6 per cent convertible preference shares, with the sale
of 4.3m shares.
Overall, these disposals have reduced Warburg Pincus' interest in Sterling's
fully diluted ordinary share capital - excluding options - from about 38 per
cent to some 10 per cent.
Mr Michael Preston, a Sterling director, has sold a beneficial holding of
500,000 ordinary shares (1.4 per cent) but retains 997,382 shares (2.7 per
cent).

KLEINWORT Benson Investment Trusts has raised Pounds 28.2m for its recently
launched Emerging Markets Trust, exceeding the minimum target of Pounds 15m.
The placing two weeks ago brought in Pounds 13.6m, and a further Pounds
14.6m has come through the public offer.
Mr Simon White, managing director of KB Investment Trusts, said the level of
demand from private investors demonstrated that emerging markets have become
increasingly popular.
The trust has a simple structure of ordinary shares priced at 100p with one
warrant attached for every five shares. There is no wind-up date. Dealings
are expected to start on Thursday.

FT  20 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Acquisitions help WMI show 14% midway rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WASTE Management International, the UK-listed overseas arm of WMX
Technologies of the US, yesterday reported continued profit and revenue
growth despite poor trading conditions in many of its European markets.
Pre-tax profits for the six months to June 30 increased by 14 per cent from
Pounds 62.6m to Pounds 71.5m on revenues up 19 per cent to Pounds 455.7m
(Pounds 382m).
In the second quarter pre-tax profits increased 5 per cent to Pounds 37.1m
(Pounds 35.3m) on revenues ahead 20 per cent to Pounds 234.9m (Pounds
195.8m).
Operating profits for the half-year improved 25 per cent to Pounds 73.3m
(Pounds 58.8m), but were offset by higher net interest costs of Pounds 11.2m
(Pounds 3.45m).
Mr Edwin Falkman, chief executive, said the company continued to obtain
selected price increases in its markets, but was experiencing volume
pressures at a number of treatment and disposal facilities, particularly in
France and Italy.
He said the results reflected both the continued benefits from acquisitions,
and the strengthening of management teams which has led to further
improvement in selling, general and administrative costs as a percentage of
revenues.
The group was floated on the Stock Exchange through a listing of 20 per cent
of its shares in April last year by US-based Waste Management, since renamed
WMX Technologies.
It currently operates in nine European countries and seven others in
south-east Asia, Australasia and South America and has completed about 25
acquisitions so far this year in order to strengthen its geographic and
strategic position.
Earnings per share increased by 15 per cent to 9.8p (8.5p) for the half year
and by 22 per cent to 6.7p (5.5p) for the quarter.
The figures were slightly below expectations and the share price slipped 4p
to close at 638p yesterday.

FT  20 JUL 93 / French rescuer hit by loss on Adam
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ROYAL Bank of Scotland is buying Adam &amp; Co, the troubled Edinburgh private
bank, a year after Adam's capital was temporarily wiped out by a Pounds 21m
loss from unauthorised foreign exchange dealing.
Royal Bank is paying Pounds 10.5m for the private bank which was formed in
1983. Some Pounds 9.5m of the amount will go to Mrs Francoise Schlumberger
Primat, a French shareholder who rescued Adam &amp; Co last year by injecting
Pounds 21m.
Mrs Primat, who is 75, chose to take the loss rather than wait for her
convertible preference shares to be repaid over 20 years. The shares had a
zero coupon for 10 years and then a 5 per cent annual payment.
Mr James Laurenson, Adam's deputy chairman and managing director who will
become a non-executive director, believed Mrs Primat had 'decided that there
was an inherent loss, and that she should crystallise it now'.
The net asset value of Adam &amp; Co, which has 4,000 private banking clients,
is Pounds 13.5m. Mr Laurenson said it had opted to sell at a discount to
book value because it would be burdened by the repayment of Mrs Primat's
preference shares.
Mr Laurenson said Lazard Brothers, the merchant bank which was retained to
advise on the future of Adam &amp; Co after the currency loss, had recommended
the sale because the bank would otherwise be held back. 'We could have
carried on but we decided that we would be constrained by a lack of
financial resources. We did not think we would be able to innovate and
provide the sort of service that our customers have become used to,' he
said.
Mr George Mathewson, Royal Bank's chief executive, said the bank believed
Adam &amp; Co would complement Royal Bank's other private banking operations.
The bank owns Child &amp; Co, the 300-year-old London private bank.
'We feel that Adam has a good customer base, and fits very well with our
whole ensemble,' he said. Royal Bank believed the sale price was
appropriate.
Mr Mathewson stressed Adam would 'keep its own identity'. Two Royal Bank
executives, including Mr Tony Schofield, managing director of branch
banking, will become non-executive directors of Adam.

<TEXT>
THE NEWLY issued British Telecommunications shares yesterday closed at a
premium considerably larger than in the last sale in 1991.
On the first day of trading after the Pounds 5bn sale of the government's
final 21.9 per cent stake, the shares closed at 168p - 8p above the 160p
paid as a first instalment by institutional investors and 18p above the 150p
paid by small shareholders.
Last time on day one, the new shares gained only  1/2 p above the price paid
by institutions.
SG Warburg, the government's global co-ordinator, said small investors had
made a good profit while public assets had not been sold on the cheap.
But the merchant bank's role was called into question by some global
managers. One complained that Warburg would receive 'the lion's share of
commissions', as more than 40 per cent of institutional bids were handled by
the UK merchant bank.
The Labour party called for an inquiry into the Stock Exchange's management
of the sale.
Mr Jim Cousins, Labour's spokesman on telecommunications, voiced his concern
over whether the BT price could be maintained in the longer term, when
Warburg would not be able to stabilise the share price.
Some analysts have said the government created an 'artificial market' by
warning institutions they would not receive all the shares they applied for
if they sold large amounts of BT stock before the sale.
There was some surprise that the existing fully-paid share price rose by 5p
to 413 1/2 p, instead of falling on the first day of trading as they had
last time.
In the short-term Warburg can exercise a 'green shoe' option - or
stabilisation provision - by buying an additional 91.5m shares, equivalent
to 7.5 per cent of the 1.2bn sold. Warburg said the price had risen
yesterday without its intervention.
More than 180m partly-paid shares were traded. The share shops reported
fairly heavy buying by retail investors who had not received any shares.
Mr Tony Vine-Lott, chief executive of Barclays Stockbrokers, said: 'Small
shareholders who were disappointed in the allocation process have been
topping up their holding.'
UK institutional demand for the new shares was weak, mainly because they
received a bigger allocation than their counterparts in the rest of the
world.

FT  20 JUL 93 / RTZ to sell Nerco's oil and gas interests for Dollars 510m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RTZ CORPORATION, the world's biggest mining company, has signed definitive
agreements to sell for Dollars 510m (Pounds 340m) cash the oil and gas
interests it acquired only last month when it bought Nerco, the floundering
US natural resources group previously 82 per cent owned by PacifiCorp.
The UK group has also already sold some of Nerco's gold mining assets for
Dollars 40m and is negotiating the sale of the rest. These sales should be
completed by the end of this year.
RTZ announced the acquisition of Nerco in February and completed the deal on
June 2 for Dollars 470m plus the assumption of Dollars 692m debt.
RTZ wanted only Nerco's coal operations in the Powder River Basin in Montana
and Wyoming. Morgan Stanley, the investment bank, was retained to sell the
oil and gas interests because they did not fit the UK company's strategic
objectives.
Most analysts considered that RTZ bought Nerco for a bargain price and they
were also impressed by the value and speed of the oil and gas assets sale.
RTZ's share price reflected this positive sentiment and gained 15p to close
last night at 683p.
Mr Nick Hatch, analyst at Ord Minnett, part of the Westpac banking group,
said: 'The price is about 10 per cent better than I expected and the deals
will help to reduce RTZ's gearing to a comfortable level faster than most
people believed possible.'
RTZ's cash outlay for Nerco was reduced to Dollars 245m by a loan from
PacifiCorp to be repaid from Nerco contract revenues. However, RTZ's gearing
briefly rose to 63 per cent. The company said that the oil and gas sale plus
the impact of an enhanced scrip dividend would reduce gearing to about 45
per cent.
Western Gas Resources, the US energy group, will pay Dollars 156.05m for
Nerco's Black Lake field, onshore in Louisiana, and the Black Lake Pipeline
Company.
Louisiana Land and Exploration Company, another US energy group, is to buy
the remainder rest of Nerco's oil and gas operations for Dollars 353.7m.

FT  20 JUL 93 / Chase Manhattan accelerates improvement in credit quality
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CHASE Manhattan's emergence from the credit problems that have bedevilled it
since the late 1980s was confirmed yesterday as it revealed a marked
improvement in credit quality during the second quarter.
A falling charge for possible credit losses, plus strong foreign exchange
and other trading income pushed net income for the period ahead to Dollars
233m, up from Dollars 152m in the same period a year earlier. Earnings per
share rose to Dollars 1.20, from Dollars 0.83.
Chase, battered by problems on US commercial property lending at the turn of
the decade, had moved earlier this year to isolate Dollars 2bn of troubled
property loans and to bolster its balance sheet with the sale of Dollars
750m of new equity.
Yesterday, the US's sixth biggest bank reported a provision of Dollars 225m
against possible credit losses in the second quarter, Dollars 70m lower than
a year earlier and down from Dollars 360m in the first quarter. Analysts saw
this as a sign of faster-than-expected improvement in credit quality.
Credit quality was also reflected in the increase in the proportion of
troubled loans covered by loan-loss reserves, to 82 per cent from 67 per
cent.
Net interest income advanced to Dollars 894m from Dollars 869m in the same
period in 1992, and the bank's net interest margin rose from 4.03 per cent
to 4.1 per cent. The bank's cost/income ratio, a key measure of efficiency,
fell to 62 per cent, down marginally from the first quarter. 'The aggressive
action programme we implemented in the second quarter is already beginning
to bolster our earnings momentum,' said Mr Tom Labrecque, chairman.
Trading in foreign exchange and derivatives, and in lesser-developed country
(ldc) markets, pushed non-interest revenues up by Dollars 100m to Dollars
693m year-on-year. Foreign exchange trading made Dollars 85m (up from
Dollars 61m), while derivatives trading brought in Dollars 54m and the ldc
markets Dollars 35m. Non-interest income was held back, though, by a Dollars
27m fall in consumer banking fees as borrowers moved to refinance mortgage
loans.
Tier one capital ratio climbed to 7.74 per cent, from 6.1 per cent.

FT  20 JUL 93 / A heart-searching time for Boots: Why the withdrawal of
Manoplax has been welcomed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Yesterday was not a good day for investors in UK drug stocks. Medeva, a
high-flying newcomer to the industry, saw its shares crash after a profits
warning.
Wellcome's shares fell heavily, as did those of Glaxo and Zeneca. To cap it
all, Boots announced it was killing off its most important new drug, the
heart treatment Manoplax.
Oddly enough, Boots's share price went up on the news. There were two
reasons for this.
First, as the company explained, the fact that it has given up hope on
Manoplax will save it Pounds 20m this year in marketing costs. Granted,
there will be a one-off charge of up to Pounds 35m for stock write-offs and
possible redundancies. But even this year, Boots said, there should be a
small net gain in profits and cash flow.
There was a more fundamental strand to the market's thinking. Boots'
management has been suffering from what analysts politely call a credibility
gap. It has seemed unwilling to acknowledge the existence of two serious
problems in its operations: its loss-making DIY business, and Manoplax,
which the market mistrusted even before the news in April that in large
doses it caused more deaths than a placebo. The decision to bite the bullet
on Manoplax is, therefore, welcomed as evidence of a new realism.
Specifically, the market now hopes that Boots will unlock value by admitting
what outside observers have believed for years: that its drugs business is
too small to be viable and should be sold off. The idea was specifically
rebutted by the company yesterday.
Indeed, this would be an odd time for such a move. Drugs stocks have been
hit heavily this year by the threat of hostile action from the Clinton
administration. But the President's plans have not even been published yet.
Plainly, it would make sense to wait until the dust has settled.
But there seems little doubt that Boots' drugs division would be worth a
good deal. Without the costs of Manoplax, operating profits are running at
around Pounds 130m a year. On that basis, according to Mr Ian White of
Kleinwort Benson, the business could be worth Pounds 700m.
Equally, there seems no real chance now of the business continuing on its
own.
Boots drew attention yesterday to its drugs in development: treatments for
obesity and schizophrenia, an anti-diabetic, an asthma drug and an
anti-depressant. But only the obesity drug is anywhere near the market. The
last two are not even in clinical trials.
A direct comparison can be drawn with another, somewhat larger, but
struggling drugs company, Fisons. Both companies suffer from a chronic
inability to discover worthwhile new drugs.
Fisons has only come up with two related asthma drugs, Intal and Tilade.
Boots has come up with two related arthritis drugs, ibuprofen and
flurbiprofen, both of which are now off patent.
In a world where drugs giants, such as Merck and Glaxo, are feeling the
squeeze, it is a meagre diet to survive on.
But if Boots cannot yet bring itself to sell off its drugs business, it is
at least in the process of reorganising it. Its interim figures will for the
first time break down the division into its constituents: prescription
drugs, over-the-counter medicines and products made under contract.
If decisions have not been made, there is at least more room for manoeuvre.
However, getting rid of all or part of the drugs division would not
necessarily solve Boots' problems.
As Mr John Richards, of NatWest Markets, remarks, it would merely wind the
clock back to the late 1980s, before Manoplax had come to prominence and
before the ill-judged acquisition of the retail group Ward White.
'Boots is a company with a very strong core business generating cash, which
needs to do something else strategically if it is to get above-average
growth', Mr Richards says.
'The question is, where does it go in the longer term?'

FT  20 JUL 93 / Carsberg threatens Abta with legal action over rule
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR BRYAN Carsberg, director-general of fair trading, has threatened to take
legal action against the Association of British Travel Agents unless it
allows tour operators which are not members of the association to sell their
holidays through Abta agents.
Sir Bryan's threat came in a letter to the Association of Independent Tour
Operators (Aito) which wrote to him complaining that some of its members had
had difficulty joining Abta.
As a result, they had been unable to sell their holidays through
Abta-affiliated outlets because an Abta rule stipulates its agents should
sell only foreign holidays provided by association members.
The rule, known as Stabiliser, was introduced in 1965. In 1982, the
Restrictive Practices Court ruled it was in the public interest and could be
legally enforced as it ensured customers were protected provided they bought
holidays from Abta members.
The legality of the Abta rule was thrown into doubt, however, by the
introduction at the beginning of this year of new EC rules on package
holidays. These require all providers of package holidays, whether Abta
members or not, to ensure customers' money is adequately protected.
Sir Bryan made it clear in his letter to Aito that he believed Abta's
Stabiliser should be abolished now that the new rules had come into force.
He said: 'Abta are aware that I am concerned about the continuation of
Stabiliser, which is effectively tying your members who wish to sell
overseas package holidays through Abta agents to (the association). If Abta
do not end it, I may apply to the court for leave to have the court's
earlier decision which upheld Stabiliser reviewed.'
Aito says its members have been told they can only join Abta if they arrange
Abta bonds for their road and ferry holidays. Air holidays are bonded by the
Civil Aviation Authority. Aito says it has its own bonding arrangements
which cover members' surface travel holidays and these should be sufficient.
In his letter, Sir Bryan agreed, saying he thought Abta should be prepared
to accept the financial protection of any company which complied with the
new regulations.
Abta said yesterday it was not prepared to accept Aito's financial
guarantees because it was concerned about the adequacy of back-up
arrangements if the bonds proved insufficient.
Abta's national council agreed last month that Stabiliser would have to end.
As this would require an extraordinary general meeting, it did not believe
it could happen before September.

FT  20 JUL 93 / Bonn urged to support free EC labour market: Clarke rules
out retreat into a 'fortress Europe'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR KENNETH CLARKE, the chancellor of the exchequer, last night sought to win
Germany as an ally for the UK government's policy of freer trade and
deregulation of European labour markets to reduce unemployment.
The European Community, he told an audience in Munich, could 'either compete
or retreat'. Ruling out retreat into a 'fortress Europe', Mr Clarke stressed
the need for the EC to become more competitive rather than try to preserve
its high labour costs behind a protectionist wall.
'Every regulation that adds costs, loses jobs,' he told the
Deutsch-Englische Gesellschaft (Anglo-German Society).
Underlining the government's opposition to the social chapter of the
Maastricht treaty, he said the UK would 'continue to fight hard against the
legal imposition on all enterprises, big and small, of shorter working
weeks, statutory paternity leave, higher social security benefits, regulated
pay bargaining systems, the forced introduction of new technology and so
on'.
Speaking just three days before the crucial House of Commons vote on the
treaty's social chapter, Mr Clarke said the chapter 'would impose
unnecessary extra costs on business and act as a barrier to employment'. He
defended the UK's social provision 'as one of the best all-round systems of
welfare in Europe', saying that Britain 'had no intention of going back to
an era of sweatshops and poverty labour'.
Mr Clarke's visit to Germany, less than two months after he became
chancellor, is a clear demonstration that he sets greater store by close
ties with Britain's EC partners than did his Euro-sceptic predecessor, Mr
Norman Lamont.
But his trip, which included meetings with Mr Theo Waigel, the German
finance minister, Mr Hans Tietmeyer, the Bundesbank president-designate, and
business leaders, had a strategic purpose.
Building on UK initiatives at last month's EC summit in Copenhagen and the
Group of Seven summit in Tokyo two weeks ago, Mr Clarke was seeking German
backing for a campaign to move EC policy in the direction of labour market
reform and deregulation, and freer trade.
'Labour markets are the crux of Europe's economic woes. Over-rigid,
over-regulated and overpriced,' Mr Clarke said. 'The first step must be for
EC governments to look at the whole range of extra costs we force on
businesses by excessive regulation,' he declared.
European unemployment had grown 'inexorably', he said. The 17m unemployed in
the Community were 'the best measure of two decades of European economic
decline'.
Mr Clarke said it was a measure of Europe's loss of self-confidence that
emerging economies such as in China and Latin America were regarded as a
threat.
The way forward for Europe, he said, was 'to compete, to look outwards, open
our markets further, train our labour force better and believe that we can
take the share of opportunities which the widening of economic prosperity
presents'.

FT  20 JUL 93 / US airlines may be opened to more foreign investment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRIVATE SECTOR foreign airlines would be allowed to own up to 49 per cent of
the voting stock of US carriers under the tentative recommendations of an
emergency government commission on the US airline industry.
However, such deals would only be allowed on condition that the foreign
governments concerned agreed 'liberal' aviation pacts with Washington. At
present foreign companies may own up to 49 per cent of the equity of a US
carrier, but only 25 per cent of the voting stock.
In its working draft, the commission also calls for tax relief for US
airlines, asserting that the industry suffers from 'a large and
disproportionate tax burden.' However, it says, 'the industry itself,
primarily by taking on excessive debt, must bear its fair share of the
burden for its current state'.
President Bill Clinton appointed the commission in May to find ways of
strengthening the lossmaking industry. Members of the commission, who
divided themselves into four working groups to write the draft report, will
now thrash out their differences.
The draft recommendations, some of which were released yesterday, will be
reviewed by the full presidential commission and final recommendations made
in September. The draft report specifically rejects reregulating the
industry, which has seen the gradual removal of strict rules governing
fares, routes and working practices over the past decade. However, the
report calls for the close involvement of the US government in the
industry's business plans. It recommends the creation of a presidentially
appointed financial advisory committee, which would define 'financial health
standards for airlines and advise the secretary of transportation when an
airline's financial condition poses risks to itself or the industry'.
The transportation department would monitor the financial heath of airlines
and review, with the proposed financial advisory committee, a company's
financial plans. The secretary should use his existing authority to
'encourage a return to financial health', says the draft.
Among its recommendations on international trade policy, the draft warns
that the current system of negotiating bilateral aviation pacts 'is no
longer conceptually sound nor sufficiently growth oriented'.
It calls for the negotiation of multinational agreements encompassing
liberal provisions for passenger and cargo services; charters; cross-border
investment and ownership; cabotage; market access; system capacity; and
customs and immigration facilities.
It wants the stature of international air service negotiations raised and an
ambassador-at-large appointed to lead them.
The draft report's recommendations also include the reduction of current US
ticket and cargo taxes.

FT  20 JUL 93 / The Lex Column: Japan
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The muted response of the markets to Japan's general election suggests that
investors were already braced for the political horse-trading which now
looks certain. One unanswered question is whether the government which
emerges will have sufficient authority to take an economic lead. The
downward lurch in the stock market which followed the Liberal Democrats'
defeat in parliament last month reflected the waning chances of further
fiscal stimulus this year. With no clear winner at the ballot box, investors
have little reason to revise that opinion.
The economic news in the run-up to the election has been far from
encouraging. Industrial production and retail sales figures have cast doubt
on the view that the recession has bottomed. Yesterday's money supply
figures seem to offer more hope, but broad money growth is being driven by
public sector institutions. Lending by private sector banks remains weak.
Unless the yen's upward march on the foreign exchange market is thrown into
quick reverse, Japanese companies under pressure at home will find scant
relief in export markets.
If the run of bad economic data - and a period of populist campaigning - has
forged a political consensus on the need for further stimulus, the chances
of another spending package this year can have only improved. Now the LDP is
weakened, tax cuts may be thrown into the policy pot. Yet with the
composition of government now wide open the markets may have to settle in
for drift.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
For a company which dwells on the long-term nature of its investments, RTZ
has proved a dab hand at some Hanson-style asset-shuffling following last
month's acquisition of Nerco. Having paid Dollars 470m for the business plus
the assumption of Dollars 692m of debt, RTZ will now realise almost Dollars
600m from selling Nerco's peripheral gold, oil and gas assets. That leaves
RTZ with a cheap and cheerful coal business which should benefit from the
nascent US recovery. Moreover, Nerco's debt was part funded by the vendor.
The rest can be easily restructured given RTZ's strong credit rating.
The scale and speed of the disposals remove any lingering worries about the
financial burden imposed by the Nerco purchase. The asset sales will cut
gearing from 63 per cent to 45 per cent, strengthening RTZ's financial
flexibility as recovery shimmers on the horizon.
All that is needed to complete RTZ's run of fortune is a firm upswing in
metals. That, though, may prove elusive while European and Japanese markets
remain depressed and US demand patchy. High inventory levels have also built
slack into the system, suggesting prices may not firm greatly until the
second half of 1994. Strong currency gains resulting from sterling's
devaluation and the resilience of demand in south-east Asia will tide RTZ
over this year. If and when worldwide economic recovery arrives, RTZ's
appeal as a diversified play on the metals cycle can only magnify.

FT  20 JUL 93 / The Lex Column: Medeva
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It will take more than explanations and assurances to restore confidence in
Medeva. The overstatement of sales at its IMS subsidiary - and separate
disagreement with the US Food and Drug Administration over production
standards - point to management weaknesses. Never mind that bigger and
better drugs companies have fallen into similar traps. Even on the bold
assumption that these episodes can be resolved without further damage, they
raise the spectre of nasty surprises lurking elsewhere in the group.
Having subscribed to April's rights issue in good faith only to watch the
shares almost halve in value yesterday, shareholders might thus expect some
positive action. Medeva has already gone some way towards strengthening
management. But the onus remains with the company to prove that financial
and other management controls have not lagged behind its expansion.
The deeper problem, though, may lie with strategy. Buying drugs companies
with good organic growth prospects, yet too small to interest the giants of
the sector, is coherent enough. But only if the pace of acquisitions does
not outstrip Medeva's ability to manage them. Similar strategies in other
markets - such as advertising, food distribution and hosiery - have come to
a sticky end. There is no reason why pharmaceuticals should be different. At
the very least Medeva should take time out from empire-building and let
organic growth take the strain.

FT  20 JUL 93 / The Lex Column: Heartache for Boots
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Now that Boots' wheezing pharmaceuticals strategy has finally collapsed, the
company cannot avoid questions about the future of its drugs division. To
put it at its highest, there has only ever been a tenuous connection between
ethical pharmaceuticals research and retailing. Contract manufacturing and
over-the-counter drugs may have a role in sustaining Boots, but any serious
ambitions in new drug development seem to have expired along with Manoplax.
Whether Boots' management can now summon the will to make a graceful exit
is, however, another question. The board has a rigorous appraisal system for
businesses, yet that process has not so far persuaded it to dump Ward White
elephants such as Do It All. Even if it decides on a managed withdrawal, the
route is uncertain. Demerging ethical drugs would have the advantage of
putting its value in the hands of shareholders. There might, however, be
difficulty in deciding just which assets should go into the demerged
company. Selling the division to a larger drugs player would dilute earnings
and raise worries about how the management would spend the proceeds.
Shareholders have not yet forgotten how much value went west with the Ward
White bid.
Putting capital to work is a question for the group anyway, since the
company's drive for cash may leave it with net cash this year. Currently the
management's answer is expansion of Halfords, and growth in Boots the
Chemist. Yet in a tough market BTC's margins look vulnerable, nor has it yet
launched a market share initiative to rival the Marks and Spencers
'outstanding value' campaign. Halfords somehow looks an unlikely ground for
Boots to prove the critics wrong.

FT  20 JUL 93 / Leading Article: Pakistan's chance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE POWER struggle between Pakistan's president and prime minister had sunk
the country so far into political paralysis that the resignations of both
could only be welcomed. Their failure to resolve their differences
underlines the immaturity of Pakistan's democracy. However, the wholesale
clearing of the decks on Sunday - with national and provincial assemblies
all dissolved, and an interim government appointed - offers the possibility
of a step forward for democracy after October's elections.
Not long ago, there would have been no doubt how to resolve such a crisis.
It is encouraging that, on this occasion, the army did not take power but
appears to have acted as honest broker. That it could perform the role
effectively is testimony to its continuing pervasive power. But the generals
have provided evidence of the sincerity of their claims to be no longer
interested in political power. Politicians need to try harder to fill
responsibly the role the military has vacated.
Their attempts to do this have been undermined by the role of the
presidency. A president can wield power, manipulating behind the scenes and
having the ultimate sanction of being able to dismiss governments, but he
has no responsibility for formulation or execution of policy. Mr Ghulam
Ishaq Khan used his powers to sack the governments of Ms Benazir Bhutto and
Mr Nawaz Sharif, the latter because he sought to curb the presidential
prerogative.
However, the authority of the presidency has been considerably dented by the
Supreme Court's decision in May to reinstate Mr Sharif and by Mr Khan's
departure. The recent turmoil will have been of benefit if the newly elected
national assembly, with the acquiescence of a new president, votes to
restrict the president's power. This would give the next government the
opportunity to stand or fall simply on the success of its policies.
Mr Khan's resignation represents a victory for Mr Sharif, even though he has
himself had to step down. If he wins the election, he will have considerably
enhanced his authority. His record is mixed. A solid leader without much
spark or charisma, he has enacted much-needed economic reform which has
spurred business but has failed to solve chronic problems such as the budget
deficit.
Ms Bhutto, his opponent, has got what she wanted: elections two-and-a-half
years into his five-year term. Yet it will not be easy to forget that, in
order to oust Mr Sharif, she chose to strike an alliance with Mr Khan, who
had dismissed her government. Her previous inept performance as prime
minister, and her failure to demonstrate that her calls for elections were
backed by popular clamour, do not augur well for her chances.
Pakistan needs to show that it has both a political system and economic
policies which provide clarity and continuity. It now has an opportunity.

FT  20 JUL 93 / A new idiom of welfare: A change in approach to social
security in Conservative and Labour parties
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The future of the welfare state has become the subject of intense political
debate between the UK's main political parties.
Despite both sides' desire to portray their differences as an unbridgeable
gulf, however, there is a surprising amount of agree-ment on the need for
radical change.
'Radical ideas will often prove impractical or unattractive,' Mr Peter
Lilley, the social security secretary, said last month in his Mais lecture
to City University Business School in London. 'But they often highlight
strengths or weaknesses of the system and so help generate more modest but
practical proposals.'
The Labour party has contracted out its thinking on social security to the
independent Commission on Social Justice, chaired by Sir Gordon Borrie, the
former director-general of fair trading. He was equally keen on radical
thinking when he launched the commission's first two position papers
yesterday.
'Tinkering will not improve an outdated system,' he said. 'We diagnose the
need for radical change.'
The reasons for this shared interest in new thinking are different, however,
and lead to different sorts of conclusions.
The Conservative government is struggling to contain a Pounds 50bn deficit
in the public finances. Social security accounts for almost a third of
public expenditure and has been soaking up an increasing share of national
income since 1979.
Cutting it - or at least constraining future growth - is essential if the
Tories are to achieve their aim of reducing the share of national income
spent by the state. That means better targeting, or more self-provision, or
both, according to Mr Lilley.
For Labour, the problem is shedding its image as a tax-and-spend party. At
the last election, it was committed to a raft of policies that would have
added further to the growth in the social security bill, such as restoring
the link between pensions and wages.
Labour needs a new approach that allows it to preserve its brand strength as
the party trusted to look after the welfare state and combine this with a
more realistic view about what people are willing to vote for.
Sir Gordon's commission appeared yesterday to be squaring the circle by
linking social security reform with economic renewal.
'You cannot create a successful economy in a sickly society,' Sir Gordon
said. 'Equally you cannot have a successful society in a sickly economy.'
He would rather treat the social security budget as an investment in helping
everyone make the maximum contribution to the UK's economic success.
The commission sees full employment as the key to creating a more just
distribution of income and opportunity, and to enhancing economic
efficiency. Reforms should be directed to creating full employment, rather
than patching 'an increasingly tattered safety net'.
Mr Lilley also emphasises the relationship between the welfare state and
economic growth - or rather the importance of designing a social security
system that does not stifle growth. He is, after all, a member of a
government that implacably opposes the social chapter of the Maastricht
treaty on the grounds that it would add to business costs and reduce the
UK's competitiveness.
So Mr Lilley warns of the impact on the economy if higher taxes are needed
to pay for further growth in the welfare state. He is also aware that better
targeting to cut social security costs could damage the economy if it
reduces incentives.
'The more the provision for needs and risks is monopolised by the state, the
less the incentive to work and save to provide for them,' he said.
Labour's approach may be more attractive to the voters in the short term,
since it stresses opportunities rather than cuts in benefits.
In contrast, the dour Mr Lilley may yet be accused of losing the
Christchurch by-election for the Conservatives through his efforts to
encourage a debate. He published figures that appear to point inexorably
towards cuts in social security benefits in the future on the day before the
campaign started in a constituency where more than a third of the voters are
pen-sioners.
In the longer term, however, Labour probably has the harder task.
The reluctance to pay more in tax is a worldwide phenomenon, and Britain is
unlikely to prove the exception in the next general election. If Labour is
to increase spending on, for example, childcare to help single parents get
back to work, then something else will have to be cut.
'The language of priorities is the religion of socialism,' as Aneurin Bevan
said. Finding popular support for new priorities may prove a harder task
than attacking Conservative cuts.

Starving in London, six jobless Oxford arts graduates drew lots. The one
getting the shortest straw was to commit suicide and the pair with the next
shortest would sell the body for scientific research.
The deed done, the two took the sack-covered corpse off in a cart. But when
they limped back hours later, they still had the body with them. 'It's
useless,' they gasped. 'Nobody's taking anything but Cambridge scientists
with first-class honours.'

Tarnished halo for Gro Harlem Brundtland. The winner of the 12 Environmental
Star Award in 1989 for her efforts as chairman of the UN World Commission on
Environment and Development has been asked to give it back. In May, Norway -
prime minister, Gro Harlem Brundtland - resumed commercial whaling in
defiance of an eight-year ban by the International Whaling Commission. Not
surprisingly, the European Environmental Bureau does not consider whaling to
be 'compatible with sustainable development nor does it represent
responsible management of marine resources'.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Spy mistress turned cover girl Stella Rimington has had an uncomfortable
time since being pushed into the limelight as part of John Major's campaign
for openness in government. First, she had to undergo moving house while
trying to dodge the press in endless cat-and-mouse games before her face was
freed for front-
page consumption. Then, she had to suffer the professional embarrassment of
seeing the IRA, with its continued string of atrocities, dent the
credibility of the service's counter-terrorist operation. Now she has to
spend valuable time powdering her nose for all those photo opportunities.
But Observer's moles in St James's are unruffled. They believe Rimington is
performing her job just perfectly - suitably diverting attention from the
real boss who remains as incognito as ever, whatever the prime minister may
say.

department, which in turn hastened the private bank's loss of independence.
'I don't think even their Wood (Britain's highest paid executive) has pulled

FT  20 JUL 93 / Observer: Adam's angel
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Adam &amp; Co, the small Edinburgh private bank snapped up by the Royal Bank of
Scotland, was yesterday sounding a little uncertain as to whether Madame
Francoise Schlumberger Primat would accept its invitation to remain on the
Adam board. On balance the view was that the septuagenarian angel who
injected Pounds 21m last year when the bank was on the brink of collapse
would not be staying on.
Although the reclusive grande dame shuttles regularly between her two French
chateaux, her estate in Shropshire and her house in south-west Ireland, and
could presumably still fit in a side trip to Edinburgh on occasion, she is
'hedging slightly' over accepting the directorship, according to Adam's
outgoing managing director, James Laurenson. 'Although her English is quite
good, she finds a lot of people talking together at board meetings quite
hard.'
She's a realist and is not upset at any aspect of the sale, says Laurenson,
who claims that all her business will be staying. No doubt RBS will be
pleased to hear that; she is easily the private bank's largest customer.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Martin Dunn will be reprinting his calling cards - yet again. The one-time
deputy editor of Rupert Murdoch's The Sun was late last year being wooed by
Mort Zuckerman to edit his New York Daily News.
At that time he was editing another Murdoch tabloid, Today, from which
position he duly resigned only to be informed - by fax - that Zuckerman had
decided that maybe it wasn't such a good idea to have yet another British
editor in New York after all. Things looked decidedly sticky for Dunn until
Murdoch came to the rescue and offered him the Boston Herald.
Four months on, Zuckerman has had a change of heart and enticed Dunn to the
Daily News with an offer that was perhaps worth waiting for. A figure of
Dollars 1.5m over three years is mooted.
At the News, Dunn will compete head-on with his predecessor at the Boston
Herald, Ken Chandler, who edits the New York Post - which just happens to
have been saved from extinction by his old benefactor: Rupert Murdoch.

FT  20 JUL 93 / Leading Article: Howard's choice
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THOUSANDS OF British police officers are due to demonstrate at Wembley later
today against radical proposals to reform their pay and conditions from the
government-appointed Sheehy committee. They are resisting recommendations to
introduce fixed-term contracts, to relate pay to performance and to lift
their retirement age from 55 to 60.
Mr Michael Howard, who was appointed home secretary after Sheehy was
commissioned, has yet to reveal where he stands. Such a wait-and-see
approach is sensible because, when his response comes, it will need to be
wise. While it is essential that the police's restrictive practices are
rooted out, change should ideally be accomplished without antagonising those
within the force who can be won over for reform.
The central objective should be to reform practices which virtually
guarantee jobs for life. The aim must be to ensure that good officers are
recruited and retained, while those who are not up to the job smarten up
their act or leave. Achieving this will certainly require some form of
performance-related pay. The current system of awarding uniform rises to all
denies initiative to managers and gives individual officers little incentive
to improve performance.
But, to achieve better performance, there is no need for Sheehy's most
controversial proposal - 10-year fixed-term contracts. The police are
rightly worried that such a system could make it difficult to hire the best
recruits and undermine careers. Given that most of the private sector
operates on open-ended contracts which allow employees to be fired for poor
performance after several months notice, it is not clear why fixed-term
contracts are needed for the police. Moreover, if officers are
underperforming, they should be removed long before 10 years are up.
If Mr Kenneth Clarke were still home secretary his instinct might be to
polarise the debate, paint the police as Luddites and ram through Sheehy's
proposals. But the government's education reforms showed that determination
in a fundamentally sound course needs to be tempered by subtlety. If Mr
Howard can win consent by dropping the unnecessary recommendation of
fixed-term contracts, he should grasp the opportunity.

FT  20 JUL 93 / Neighbours with broken fences: The increasingly fractious
relations between Russia and the former Soviet republics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As though they were acting in concert, all the former Soviet republics are
again in a ferment. North, south and west, the now independent states
circling Russia are at least fragile, and often convulsed by civil war.
In the three Caucasian states of Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia, conflict
between the political leadership and rebel movements over the control of
land has become increasingly bloody, with both sides dependent on victory
for survival.
In the Baltics, Estonia and Latvia are struggling to enforce a new
definition of citizenship that would reverse the post-second world war flow
of Russians into their tiny populations, or at least assimilate them
rapidly.
In Moldova, the old struggle over control of the Trans Dnestr area remains
barely quiescent - and Russian troops remain in place.
In Belarus, the head of parliament (and of state) was almost dismissed by
his own deputy for not being sufficiently 'pro-Russian'.
In Ukraine, the prime minister demands, unsuccessfully, the proclamation of
an economic state of emergency as the war of words with Russia over control
of the Crimean region and the Black Sea fleet based there flares again. This
follows the declaration 10 days ago by Russia's parliament of sovereignty
over Sevastopol, the Black Sea port.
In central Asia, the fighting which has reduced Tajikistan to dependence on
Russian troops for the preservation of the government threatens to spill
over into Uzbekistan, where an oppressive order is maintained. Both
Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan are peaceful, but the latter is desperately poor
and both fear a widening gulf between the large Russian minorities and the
native Kazakhs and Kyrgyz.
These diverse crises share two common characteristics.
First, in each of the 15 former Soviet republics a bitter conflict is taking
place for control of the nation. Even the best politicians of these young
republics (and many are opportunist and ruthless) grope in a fog of
ignorance which under-trained and inert bureaucracies do nothing to dispel.
In each state, there is a 'nationalist' wing which wants to ensure the least
involvement in the Commonwealth of Independent States - the umbrella
structure covering the former Soviet republics - and a 'pragmatic' party
which seeks to maintain minimal neighbourly relations, especially with the
biggest neighbour of all, Russia.
The second factor is the relationship all the former republics have with
Russia. Russia dominates, not simply because it is the main provider of
energy to many and a market for all, but because it retains hegemony over
all former Soviet land space. Russia has troops loyal to it in every
republic except Azerbaijan; some 25m ethnic Russians are scattered 'abroad'
and concentrated in areas such as eastern Ukraine and northern Kazakhstan;
and Russia retains the control systems for nuclear weapons based in three
other republics.
The Caucasian struggles are the bloodiest. Both Azerbaijan and Georgia have
been left with malign legacies. Within their borders are autonomous areas
which wish to adhere to states other than the ones which enclose them. In
Azerbaijan, Nagorno-Karabakh, peopled now almost wholly by Armenians, has
declared its sovereignty. In Georgia, the region of Abkhazia in the
north-east aspires to become a Russian province - though the Abkhazians make
up less than 20 per cent of the population.
In the Abkhazian capital of Sukhumi, on the Black Sea, the two sides are
engaged in a conflict which is shattering what was once an elite resort. Mr
Eduard Shevardnadze, the Georgian leader, remains in the city in an effort
to stiffen what has been a feeble defence by the untrained Georgian forces.
Along the eastern borders of Karabakh, in the Azeri frontier towns of
Fizuli, Agdam and Ter-Ter, the Karabakhers press into the outlying villages.
A recent trip to two frontier towns revealed an Azeri 'army' of scared
teenagers and local townsmen with a few ex-Soviet officers in command. In
Baku, the capital, a president democratically elected 12 months ago fled as
a former Azeri commander in Karabakh, Mr Suret Guseinnov, threatened to
march on the capital. Mr Guseinnov is now prime minister.
In these societies, democracy is often a shell and the economy - with the
partial exception of oil-rich Azerbaijan - ruined. Armenia shivered through
last winter with minimum power and little heat, its industry all but halted.
Georgia is likely to be the same this winter. Prosperous enough in Soviet
times, they have been reduced to international beggary.
The Balts do not face poverty; they face problems of national
self-definition. In Estonia and Latvia, the main obstacle to building the
nation is the presence of hundreds of thousands of Russians of uncertain
allegiance. Russians account for more than 30 per cent of the population in
Estonia and some 34 per cent in Latvia. These postwar Russian settlers now
exist in a limbo. Once the masters of their universe, today they are
disenfranchised.
Estonia is the first flashpoint, with a war of words under way between it
and Russia over a law on aliens. The law, passed two weeks ago by the
parliament, gives non-ethnic Estonians a year to pass a language exam as a
necessary - but not sufficient - condition of being granted citizenship.
The Russian-dominated city of Narva in north-east Estonia voted by a big
majority in a referendum at the weekend for autonomy. This was immediately
declared unconstitutional by Estonia, but the struggle will continue.
The status of Russians everywhere in the former Soviet Union is at the heart
of the crisis. Will that status be one of a minority loyal to their new
homelands - or a potential fifth column, which could be mobilised by a
Russian government with expansionist designs? The Baltic governments, with
memories of the slaughter of their people after the second world war by
Soviets, tend to the latter view; the Ukrainians, with a history of peaceful
co-existence, inter-marriage and co-operation with the Russians, hope the
relationship will survive.
Yet in Ukraine, too, there are flashpoints. In the Crimea, Russia's
parliament now lays claim to Sevastopol and the Black Sea fleet; much of
Russian public opinion thinks the whole of the Crimea should be returned.
The Russians of eastern Ukraine now have conservative, Russian nationalist
groups in their midst, apparently gaining support in a region suffering from
the economic crisis.
The Ukrainian government is split. Distrust of Russia spreads, especially
when its parliament claims Ukrainian territory; and there are increasing
calls for retaining the nuclear weapons based in Ukraine as a safeguard
against Russia. Yet, paradoxically, the prime ministers of Ukraine, Russia
and Belarus signed a declaration 10 days ago stating that they would agree
an economic pact tying more closely their parlous economies.
These febrile moves reflect, too, the power struggles within Russia itself.
President Boris Yeltsin and his government hold a wavering line which
continues to lurch. To be sure, the government is not fully in command of
the army, and has left the generals with too much freedom, especially in the
Caucasus, to intervene in the local maelstroms.
The generals openly wish Russia to remain the dominant power in the region -
Mr Yeltsin said as much in a speech earlier this year - and will tramp
heavily on those who threaten the perceived interests of the ethnic Russians
'abroad'.
The end of great empires is evidently a slow business. Whether the ending
will be peaceful is unclear and will depend greatly on how far the economic
crises can be managed and how much support the rich western countries
continue to give. For now, the signs are not promising.

FT  20 JUL 93 / Leading Article: Maastricht's last stand
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
LORD Rees-Mogg's attempt to challenge the ratification of the Maastricht
treaty in the High Court will be an important test of British constitutional
theory and practice. His arguments raise serious questions of principle, and
deserve serious consideration. It is obvious, however, that Lord Rees-Mogg's
appeal is not motivated purely by solicitude for the niceties of
constitutional procedure, but is rather a political stratagem mounted for
the purpose of blocking the substance of the treaty. This must to some
extent overshadow the merits of his arguments.
Lord Rees-Mogg argues that the government's ratification process is
constitutionally flawed because the bill does not cover the whole of the
Maastricht treaty. In particular, it does not cover the social protocol, nor
the chapter setting out the programme for a common foreign and security
policy.
The reason why these aspects are not in the bill is that, in line with
traditional legal principles, parliamentary approval is only needed for
those parts of an international treaty which require domestic legislation or
domestic public expenditure. This is the centre of the argument. The British
government will no doubt argue that the missing elements will not involve
legislation and expenditure, Lord Rees-Mogg that it will, and it is on this
antithesis that judgment will turn.
But there could be a broader case for questioning whether these traditional
legal distinctions, between domestic and foreign, are any longer really
appropriate for the ratification of a European Community treaty. Much of
what is in Maastricht is framed as plans for future action; in the case of
foreign policy, it does not specify what that policy will be, because it
cannot; we cannot be sure in advance, therefore, whether it will call for
domestic legisla-tion or expenditure.
The government opposes a referendum, on the grounds that parliament is and
remains the appropriate locus for democratic decision-making. Yet this claim
is hardly consistent with a ratification procedure which is explicitly
designed to exclude parliament from those parts of the treaty which in
theory are purely foreign or inter-governmental. It is obvious that
Maastricht is a far-reaching agenda for the future direction of European
integration, in which the whole is more significant than the sum of the
parts. If we rely on parliament to express democratic approval of the
treaty, at the very least it ought to be able to express its political
approval of the whole of the treaty, even if this involves an innovation in
British constitutional procedure.
None of this alters the fact, however, that the most pressing need is for
the treaty to be ratified with the procedures as they exist. The government
is obviously in great embarrassment over the danger that it may on Thursday
be voted down on the social chapter, by an unholy alliance of the Labour
party and its own party's Euro-sceptics. But it should not allow this event
to deflect it from its top priority, which is the completion of the
parliamentary procedures required for ratification.
The FT opposes the social chapter because this is not the moment to run any
risk, however small, of adding recklessly to Europe's labour costs. This may
well be a week, however, when the government frightens its own rebels with
the prospect of a treaty which removes Britain's opt-out. The bottom line on
Maastricht is that the government will be justified in using whatever
tac-tics are required to complete what has been a mostly unilluminating
parliamentary process. Stratagem must be matched against stratagem.

FT  20 JUL 93 / Few corners to cut: The chancellor's dilemma: an inside view
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BILL ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The best way to reduce public borrowing would be to cut public spending,
because there is no doubt that it would work. The alternative, raising tax
rates, is considered a poor second-best by financial markets. They worry
that high tax rates damage incentives, reduce growth and may not produce the
hoped-for extra yield.
Unfortunately, cutting public spending is more easily said than done.
General government expenditure has grown, year in year out, for 30 years,
regularly coming in above target. That was true even under the Thatcher
governments, dedicated to reining in public spending, when 'the cuts' became
a fact of life and were blamed for everything from shortages of school books
to potholes.
But Mrs Thatcher's approach to public spending, based on plans, did achieve
a reduction in its rate of growth in real terms. (Public spending grew more
slowly than the rate of inflation in the late 1980s when unemployment, and
associated benefits, started to fall.) It also reduced the share of national
income devoted to public spending.
That was a historic achievement, because (as the chart shows) public
spending has tended to take an increasing share of GDP since the war.
Earlier Conservative governments had at best managed to hold the share
constant, while Labour governments of the 1960s and 1970s presided over some
spectacular increases.
However, the most important influence on the public spending share is not
the complexion of the government. It is the economic cycle. The share has
risen especially sharply in recessions (1966, 1975, 1980). It fell steadily
in the long boom of the 1980s, but has risen again sharply in the recession
of the early 1990s. So after a decade of 'cuts', the public spending share
is now actually higher than when Mrs Thatcher took office, and only 2 per
cent lower than in the recession of the early 1980s.
The political result is that the government is now accused of inadequate
provision of public services by Labour and of inadequate control of spending
by its own back-benchers. Both sets of charges seem to stick. Why?
The answer lies in the way public spending is planned. Fine-sounding, but
vague, commitments appear in election manifestos. These are costed in the
sponsoring departments. The costs are then added up by the Treasury and
compared with the total in the Budget. Invariably departmental bids exceed
available cash. That is when we read that 'the Treasury demands cuts'.
Every department then goes into the bleeding stumps routine, briefing
friendly journalists on the appalling consequences for their programmes of
meeting Treasury demands. The aim is to strengthen the hand of their
minister in the cabinet battle to set public spending priorities. The usual
outcome is that the Treasury allows some increase in the public spending
ceiling, but not enough to accommodate all bids. The losers thus complain
bitterly about 'cuts', on which they blame any shortcomings in the service
they are supposed to provide.
This time-honoured ritual ensures that, while spending plans are revised
steadily upwards, the public only hears about cuts. Few understand the
crucial difference between cuts from bids, and cuts in plans. The former
happen every year. The latter almost never.
That has implications for the problem of the Budget deficit. To reduce it
requires cuts in spending plans. The cabinet decision on public spending in
June, billed the toughest for 15 years, promised large cuts in bids but not
in plans. This does nothing to reduce the huge borrowing requirement over
the next few years. It only stops it getting worse.
Why do the costs of meeting existing commitments rise so inexorably?
Inflation can obviously make it difficult to stick to plans drawn up in cash
terms. Demographics is a commonly cited factor: an ageing population costs
more in pensions and health spending. The difficulty of improving
productivity in the jobs-for-life public sector culture is also often
blamed.
These are important factors, but inflation has not been a problem recently,
while demographics have been reducing the number of children to be educated.
That has not stopped the education budget from drifting upwards along with
the health budget.
In these two areas, rising expectations put continuous upward pressure on
spending. The point about health and education is that, if they were left to
the markets, spending on them would probably be higher. The richer people
get, the more they want to spend on these services. The effect is not
apparent if we compare one year with the next, but it is blindingly obvious
if we compare today's levels of provision with what was available shortly
after the war.
At that time, 'free education' meant learning the three Rs in a draughty
class room with bare floors inadequately heated by an open fire. The
school-leaving age was 14 and few went to university. Today the idea of free
education embraces philosophical discussions in comfortable seminar rooms in
purpose-built universities. The school-leaving age is 16 and one in four
goes on to higher education.
Rising expectations are even more apparent in the health service. Early
postwar triumphs consisted in curing some infectious diseases with the new
wonder drug penicillin and limiting the spread of others by mass
inoculation. Since then, technical progress has given us open heart surgery
and liver dialysis, available at doctors' discretion on the national health.
We are starting to debate whether cosmetic surgery - including removing
self-inflicted tattoo marks - should be available on national health.
The rising costs of public provision in health and education thus reflect
steadily rising standards, demanded most vociferously by the articulate
middle classes. It will require a radical new approach to curb them. But the
pressure on spending from health and education is dwarfed by the huge
increase in the social security budget. That is the real cuckoo in the nest,
and requires even more radical treatment. I shall return to the subject next
week.

FT  20 JUL 93 / When money grows on trees: The possible privatisation of
British forests
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The prospect of Britain's forests being sold to the private sector has
produced an unlikely alliance of environmentalists, ramblers, timber users
and private landowners. They are fighting to preserve the independence of an
old enemy, the Forestry Commission, which owns and runs the UK's state
forests.
The government, they argue, is about to undermine progress made by the
commission, just when it has been getting it right, pursuing policies in the
past few years that address both environmental and commercial interests.
Their fears have been sparked off by a ministerial review committee, charged
with examining Britain's tree-planting strategy and the future ownership of
forests. Campaigners have until the end of next week to make their concerns
known to the committee, which reports to ministers at the end of this year.
While the government has not said publicly it wants to sell the state
forests, it has made it clear that ownership is up for discussion.
Campaigners fear that current budgetary pressures will tip the balance in
favour of privatisation.
The government reorganised the Forestry Commission last year, creating a
more commercially orientated division, Forest Enterprise, to run and manage
the 2m acres of state forests and woodlands that cover 5 per cent of
Britain's land area. This left more general matters of regulation and policy
with the commission. Environmentalists believe that Forest Enterprise is
being groomed for sale.
The sale of state forests has long been demanded by the Conservative right
and by some private foresters, who argue that the forests in private hands
would be more commercially dynamic.
Conservationists say that private owners would adopt less environmentally
sensitive planting policies, while ramblers fear the right of public access
to Forestry Commission woods would disappear.
The debate over possible privatisation, however, threatens to divert
attention from the committee's main task of reviewing the system of
incentives for tree planting put in place in 1988. But the two issues are
intertwined.
It was in his 1988 Budget that Mr Nigel Lawson, then chancellor of the
exchequer, announced the replacement of tax incentives for planting trees
with grants. At the same time, tree planting became more tightly controlled
 -new conifer plantations now have to contain at least 5 per cent of
broad-leaved, or deciduous, trees such as alder or oak.
The measures were in response to the growing unpopularity of the conifer
forests spreading across Britain's uplands. These were part of government
policy dating back to 1919 to reafforest Britain after industrialisation and
war. While conifers suit the timber industry because they are more
commercially useful, there was a growing demand from conservationists and
ramblers for more diverse and attractive woodlands, more suited to wildlife
and recreational use.
The tax concessions, whereby the cost of tree planting could be offset
against income tax, had become discredited in the mid-1980s.
Environmentalists discovered that trees were being planted on behalf of
individuals, such as TV personalities, as a means of avoiding tax rather
than being part of a national planting strategy.
Tree-planting fell sharply when the tax concessions ended, dropping from a
peak of 25,400 a hectare in the year to March 31 1989 to 15,000 a hectare in
the last financial year.
For the timber users, state ownership of the forests underpins steady
supplies. Forest Enterprise provides saw mill companies with timber largely
irrespective of timber prices, with any loss covered from its subsidy (about
Pounds 45m this year). Timber users fear that private owners would sell wood
only when timber prices were good.
And big timber processors with long-term supply contracts with Forest
Enterprise fear they would not survive privatisation. Some landowners,
meanwhile, are worried that foreign companies would buy Britain's forests
cheaply.
On the other side of the argument, private foresters believe that the best
way of ensuring a ready supply of the right sort of timber is to privatise.
'Privatisation would take the (Forestry) Commission's 40 per cent share of
Britain's forestry out of the secretive, inefficient world of the civil
service,' one private forester says.
Mr Peter Johnson, chairman of Tilhill Economic Forestry, which plants and
manages woodlands, says the current rate of planting is even worse than the
official figures suggest, because less than one-third of current planting is
'commercially significant'. Mr Len Yull, Tilhill's marketing director,
explains: 'The only trees that provide the timber which industry can use, in
building homes or making furniture or making paper, are conifers. Yet we are
being encouraged to plant broad-leaves which are often purely decorative, or
if commercial will not mature for 80 years.' Conifers mature in 40 years.
He adds: 'It's a tragedy because Britain is ideal for commercial forestry.
Because of our climate, our trees grow up to twice as fast as in Russia and
Scandinavia which we import from.' Britain meets only about 13 per cent of
its timber needs from its own forests and it had a Pounds 4.5bn trade
deficit in timber-based products in 1991.
Supporters of private sector forestry are lobbying for two things. First,
they say, the government should even out the subsidies for agriculture and
those for forestry. 'There is too little tree planting because land that
could be used for forestry is too expensive. It is too expensive because the
subsidies available for farming it are much higher than those for planting
trees on it,' says Mr Craig Campbell of the Scottish Council Development and
Industry.
Second, changes in the tax system are required to attract investment in
forestry by individuals, now that the tax breaks have gone. It is suggested
that the Treasury should change the tax rules to encourage companies and
unit trusts to invest in forestry.
Environmental and leisure interests could be met, says the pro-privatisation
lobby, by splitting off woodland primarily of amenity value (for example,
the Forest of Dean, Gloucestershire) to be run by conservation groups or
local authorities. Commercial forests would be sold separately.
In the end, the voice of the Treasury could be decisive, although the state
forests might raise only about Pounds 1bn, against a public sector borrowing
requirement this year of Pounds 50bn.
The government may conclude that it would be cheaper to ignore calls for
more tree planting and leave things as they are. This would do nothing to
improve Britain's timber trade - yet there is no guarantee that private
operators would be any more successful than the Forestry Commission at
balancing commercial needs with environmental and leisure interests.

FT  20 JUL 93 / Letters to the Editor: World Bank let off too lightly
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Professor H W SINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In your otherwise well-balanced editorial, 'Improving the World Bank'
(July 15), there is one important matter on which you let the World Bank off
too lightly.
You write: 'Many failures are to be explained by adverse global
developments, such as deteriorating terms of trade.' This statement treats
the deteriorating terms of trade as entirely an external factor, nothing to
do with the World Bank.
However, some of us think, and believe we can prove, that the deteriorating
terms of trade have a great deal to do with the type of structural
adjustment programmes impressed by the World Bank (as well as the
International Monetary Fund) upon developing countries.
The pressure towards 'outward orientation' simultaneously exerted upon so
many developing countries exporting the same commodity has the predictable
outcome of deteriorating terms of trade. This will also affect countries not
directly subject to structural adjustment programmes but competing with
countries which are.
The remedy must be for the World Bank (and IMF) to pay greater attention to
aggregation problems and abandon their strict and blinkered
country-by-country approach. It also follows that the world community must
pay more attention to macro-economic management, including stabilisation of
commodity prices.

FT  20 JUL 93 / Letters to the Editor: Lesson in penal costs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Sir NICHOLAS FAIRBAIRN MP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In 1975 I asked Dr SummerskilI, the then minister concerned, what was
the cost of imprisonment or detention in England and Wales. The figures
given were Pounds 165 a month or Pounds 1,979 a year for male prisoners and
for female prisoners Pounds 231 a month or Pounds 2,773 a year. In Scotland
the equivalent figures were Pounds 156.37 a month, or Pounds 1,876.43 a
year. The equivalent figures for England and Wales in 1991-92 were Pounds
442 a week for male prisoners and Pounds 629 a week for female prisoners.
In Scotland the equivalent figures for 1992-93 are Pounds 24,550 for a
closed prison a year and Pounds 31,000 for an open prison or young
offenders' institution, an increase of more than 15 times. In 1973-75 the
cost of sending a child to a public school was greater than the cost of
keeping a child in prison. Last year the cost of keeping an adult in prison
was three times that of a residential public school.
This would seem to be one unexplained example of why we have a deficit of
Pounds 50bn and a borrowing requirement of Pounds 1bn a month. Perhaps the
chancellor, home secretary and secretary of state for Scotland could explain
how the cost of Eton is so much less than the cost of Wormwood Scrubs and
the cost of Loretto so much less than Shotts Prison.

FT  20 JUL 93 / Letters to the Editor: Unfortunate if Tecs were to decide to
downgrade training
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr JAMES MURPHY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The disenchantment of the Training and Enterprise Councils with
'training unemployed people for jobs when there are so few jobs to go
around' is understandable ('Good try but could do better', July 14).
As the latest Labour Market Quarterly Report reveals, the success of their
trainees in finding work is not overly encouraging. In the case of Youth
Training, only 49 per cent succeed in finding work, while for Employment
Training this figure is 31 per cent.
Nonetheless, it would be unfortunate if merely because much training, like
much education, is now an exercise in what employment secretary David Hunt
describes as 'social welfare', the Tecs were to downgrade training.
Naturally it is more exhilarating to be in the front line, fostering
economic growth, than in the rear, patching up the casualties of economic
decline. However, it would be perverse if, on discovering that training is
not the 'midwife' of economic growth, the Tecs should decide that 'nursing'
the victims of economic decline is not, after all, a job for the
enterprising. Given such a restrictive redefinition of their function, it
should not surprise the Tecs if sooner or later someone asks: what do the
enterprising actually do?

FT  20 JUL 93 / Letters to the Editor: Taiwan must be included in trade
imbalance issues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr RICHARD MCCORMACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I agree with your suggestion that Taiwan and others in East Asia should
participate in discussions between the United States and Japan on trade
imbalance issues ('Japan and the US at odds', July 6).
Taiwan, for example, enjoys a substantial trade surplus with the US that is
roughly as large as its trade deficit with Japan. This is not a coincidence.
While Taiwan bars finished Japanese cars and certain other consumer goods,
it does permit the import of Japanese high-value-added parts and components,
which are then assembled in Taiwan and exported in large quantities as
finished products to the US and elsewhere.
Factoring in the trans-shipped components, Japan's actual trade surplus with
the US is probably not much smaller than was the case during the peak of the
high-dollar era.
Obviously this process has served as a tremendous stimulus to the economies
of East Asia. Unless, however, opportunities for trade and investment become
more balanced on both sides of the Pacific, the Golden Goose could lose some
of its feathers, at best.

FT  20 JUL 93 / Letters to the Editor: Consumers pollute water too
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr I C R BYATT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Chris Smith, shadow secretary of state for environmental protection,
writes (Letters, July 15) that where pollution cannot be prevented, the
polluter and not the consumer should pay to remove it from water. He
conveniently overlooks the fact that often when it comes to dirty water -
where the big pressures pushing up bills are to be found - the polluter is,
in fact, the consumer.
Industry already pays trade effluent charges. These should reflect the full
cost of treating the effluent. Like Chris Smith, I would like to see the
'polluter pays' principle extended - the motorist paying additional tax to
deal with the pollution that runs off our roads, for example. Future taxes
on agricultural chemicals are not going to solve the problems which require
a clean-up now.
When calculating the increase in bills arising from obligations imposed
since 1989, I assumed that investment would be paid for over the lives of
the new assets, and that the companies would need to borrow to finance these
new capital works.
The bigger the investment programme, however, the more bills may have to
rise to maintain the financial ratios which are a pre-condition of
borrowing.
This is one of the reasons why I advocate implementing obligations at a
steady rate to avoid driving up financing (and other) costs by trying to do
too much, too fast.

FT  20 JUL 93 / Arts: Lust - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After the spectacle of Sunset Boulevard, here is a return to a jollier, much
more old-fashioned kind of musical. Not since Sir John Vanbrugh's The
Relapse became Lock Up Your Daughters over 20 years ago can there have been
such a successful putting of a restoration comedy to song.
Lust is based on William Wycherley's The Country Wife and is every bit as
lewd as the original, possibly in some cases even lewder. Far more than
that, however, the show is huge fun from beginning to end. Lust is perhaps a
slightly misleading title, for there is nothing remotely sinister about it.
This lust is thoroughly healthy.
The time is given as 1661. King Charles II has just been crowned, the
characters throw off their puritan garb and the restoration is under way. So
is the music which almost never stops. The borrowings by the Heather
Brothers and the musical director, David Firman, are absolutely shameless,
but glorious. There is a touch of Mozart, a bow to Gilbert and Sullivan,
homage to Elvis and a recurrent fling with the tango. No attempt is made to
present the music as a coherent whole, but it doesn't matter in the
slightest. If it's a good song, put it in. Some of the songs in Lust are
very good indeed.
There is also a wonderful part in Horner. This is the character in
Wycherley's play who pretends to have been castrated in order to increase
his access to the ladies. Here he is played by Denis Lawson as a superbly
handsome, romantic-looking Don Juan with long flowing locks and tremendous
physical agility. Lawson can sing as well: notice his 'I Live for Love.'
Yet this is not a pretentious show. In the era of the spectacular, it comes
as a pleasant treat that the most extensive and perhaps the most expensive
prop is simply a large four-poster bed. Lawson sings in it, swings on the
horizontal bar and, of course, is caught in it. There is a marvellous
vignette when hanging from the bar, his trousers just being removed by Lady
Fidget, the couple is surprised by a potentially jealous husband. Almost
with one bound, at least of the imagination, he is free.
Some of the parts are an improvement on the original, notably Quack, the
doctor who keeps up the pretence that Horner really has turned into a eunuch
and carries the evidence to prove it. Played by Paul Leonard, this Quack is
a servant to his master in the best Don Juan tradition.
Apart from the lust, there is love. Helen Hobson's Alithea, sister to
Pinchwife, the excessively jealous husband, has a fine romantic song in
'Come Tomorrow'. And there are jokes: a splendid number called 'China',
which is not about China at all, neither the place nor the substance.
The direction is by Bob Carlton and the Haymarket is just the right theatre
for a piece that may seem modest in its aims and staging, but is vastly more
enjoyable than most other musicals. Lust is a triumph of getting the basics
right: acting, music and a good plot.

<TEXT>
You could scarcely call it a night of classic television (though there are
plenty of repeats including The Good Life and French And Saunders both on
BBC1) but if you pick your way carefully around the schedules you can have
quite an entertaining evening.
The series London Wildlife Challenge, available in the metropolis, looked at
first like just another yoof venture, with a presenter speaking estuary
English accompanied by a stooge, the two of them chasing around London -
almost literally - after wild geese. Actually Chris Packham has proved that,
regardless of the trendy blond hairstyle and the stone-washed black denim he
is a knowledgeable and entertaining biologist (7.30 ITV).
Far Flung Floyd began well last week with Keith Floyd cooking in a
Vietnamese street market, a boat, and a volley-ball court. Today he is in
Bangkok cooking another fish curry on a long tailed boat(8.30 BBC2). Then,
the oddity of the evening, A For Abba with John Peel investigating the
appeal of the Swedish quartet (9.30 BBC1) - which is a bit like getting
Floyd to review the Wimpy Bars.

FT  20 JUL 93 / Arts: Iphigenie en Tauride - Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN ALLISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The English Bach Festival production of Iphigenie en Tauride received high
praise on this page last year - Max Loppert called it 'the peak of EBF
achievement in recent years'. So it was appropriate that the company's 30th
anniversary, celebrated at the Royal Opera House on Sunday, should have been
marked by a repeat staging of Gluck's penultimate opera.
The revival brought one major change of cast: the baritone Francois Le Roux
as Orestes. He is a stylish singer, with (naturally) fine French delivery -
a pleasure to listen to. The other principals were returning, and it was no
less a pleasure to encounter Jennifer Smith's freshly voiced Iphigenia. Her
flexible, well-projected soprano conveyed the music's myriad moods - most
affecting was the way she plumbed the depths of despair in her lament 'O
malheureuse Iphigenie]'. Andreas Jaggi was an accomplished Pylades who used
his smallish tenor deftly; only the bravura demands of 'Divinites des
grandes ames' defeated him. Donald Maxwell was incisive as the tyrant Thoas,
and Fiona Rose's Diana was effective in her climactic last-act entrance.
The company is fortunate in having the services of the energetic conductor
Marc Minkowsky, a specialist in this genre. His was a dramatically paced
account, light and crisp. The period orchestra sounded thrilling at Covent
Garden, limpid in the opening minuet, biting in the palpitating
accompaniment prior to Orestes's nightmare, raspy in the Janissary effects
which Gluck deploys for the Scythian dances.
English Bach Festival's approach to works of this period is justly
acclaimed, and accords well with the heroic style of Gluck. Alain Germain's
production is a breathtaking spectacle, complete with ballet (choreography
by Stephen Preston) and costumes (by Terence Emery) based on late-18th
century models. It is much more than a 'concert in costume', even if at
times it does not wholly capture the turmoil Guillard's libretto suggests -
the Act 4 recognition scene seemed restrained.
Perhaps in its serenity the staging echoes Gluck's poignant use of major
keys in denoting terrible grief. The work contains so much inward
psychological action that it can lend itself to expressionistic treatment at
the hands of 'concept' producers - and at least this period-conscious
staging preserves its timeless quality.
The virtues of Iphigenie en Tauride are sung more frequently than the opera
itself, so it is a pity that this performance was a one-off. The production
will be given twice at next month's Athens Festival.

FT  20 JUL 93 / Arts: Colourful brush with the gods - Alan Davie at the
Barbican
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARY ROSE BEAUMONT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'The Quest for the Miraculous' is the subtitle of Alan Davie's retrospective
at the Barbican. One could say that, one way or another, we are all Questing
Beasts but that, in the nature of things, the artist is more likely to
attain the Holy Grail than the rest of us. Of course it all depends on one's
understanding of the word 'miraculous'. For me the best definition of it was
the late Harold Hobson's phrase 'the authentic frisson', that spontaneous
shiver of recognition when one is present and a thrilling moment in a
performance or when one sees a picture which is touched with genius. The
Surrealists called it 'the marvellous', something rich and strange. For Alan
Davie it is a spiritual quality which includes magic and the occult, a brush
with the gods maybe.
Davie himself wrote that and 'the mysterious element of colour . . . is
something utterly magical to me.' The colours in his paintings certainly
sing, reminding us that Davie is also an accomplished musician, and the fact
that he considers colour to be a mysterious element implies that the making
of art is for him a journey whose end is uncertain. The element of discovery
and the quest for the miraculous lies for him in the process, the imagery
being dredged up from the unconscious along the way.
Despite his globe-trotting and his intense interest in other cultures,
Davie's sensibility is essentially Scottish, that is to say Northern
European. Born in Grangemouth in 1920, he attended the Edinburgh College of
Art from 1937-1940. Perhaps it was the intervention of wartime service which
prevented him from being a second generation Scottish Colourist. As it was
he became aware of Pollock, Motherwell and Rothko well before his
contemporaries, marrying their freely-painted Abstract Expressionism to his
own Celtic heritage. The paintings of the 1950s show clearly his
indebtedness to Pollock's masks and anthromorphic figures and to the
configurations of Motherwell's 'elegies to the Spanish Republic'.
Signs and symbols of an esoteric kind increasingly appear in his work from
the beginning of the 1960s, as he became more interested in oriental
religions and primitive cultures. Imagery borrowed from Zen Buddhism, Jain
cosmology, Hopi geometrical patterns and Aboriginal bark paintings are all
combined with Celtic crosses and Egyptian ankhs in a gloriously rich stew,
so skilfully cooked that the different flavours are impossible to isolate.
Davie is popularly regarded as an abstract painter, but he is no more an
abstract artist than was Miro. All sorts of flora and fauna pop up in his
paintings: dogs, snakes, birds and insects, not to mention monsters and what
he specifically called 'earth spirit'. Some of the paintings include texts
in a variety of languages, some hieroglyphic and cryptogrammatic, often
obscure and incantatory.
The recent work has become more linear, the forms expressed with a greater
clarity, even if their meaning is as shrouded as ever. Davie thinks of the
artist as an 'arch-priest', a shaman, which certainly embraces a degree of
magic, but I baulk at the Miraculous, the authentic frisson having escaped
me (to September 5).

In the Concourse Gallery at the Barbican the Printmakers Council, a
self-governing body, is holding an exhibition of members' work, some 250
pieces in all, a colourful assortment of pictures, framed and unframed, in a
wide range of technique. All paintings, watercolours and mixed media pieces
are included to acknowledge that printmakers are more than just that. All
works are for sale with prices ranging from Pounds 50 to Pounds 3,000. For
me the star of the show was a small hologram by Joyce Peck of the Medusa, a
snip at Pounds 120. As the viewer moves his head from side to side the
Medusa's snaky locks weave and duck in concert, a spellbinding experience
(to July 28).

Michael Rothenstein RA, who died on July 6 aged 85, was one of the most
inventive printmakers of the second half of the 20th century. After studying
at Chelsea and the Central Schools and Art he became a painter in
watercolours, only turning to printmaking in 1946. A visit to Stanley
Hayter's atelier in Paris opened up new technical possibilities in graphics.
Objects of lowly origin - urban detritus, wood offcuts, metal debris,
newspaper photographs - were all grist to his mill, transforming and
extending the boundaries of printmaking. At his home in Great Bardfield,
Essex he worked in lithographs, monotypes, etchings, linocuts, woodcuts,
screenprints, and mixed media.
He became an ARA in 1977 and a full Academician in 1984. He exhibited and
taught widely as a printmaker. His imagery is wide ranging, often topical,
but if there is one particular motif with which he has been identified
beyond any other for some 40 years, it is that of the Cockerel, which for
him encapsulated energy, violence, aggression, beauty and excitement, a
suitable metaphor for his work.
But Rothenstein never forsook painting, the medium with which he had begun.
The present exhibition at Flowers Graphics, 199-205 Richmond Road, E8, shows
graphic work from the late 1960s to the present day and paintings made in
1993, as energetic and lively as ever. Ceramic bowls, jugs and platters,
decorated with typical Rothenstein beasts and flowers, are available in a
limited edition (to August 1).
A catalogue raisonne, The Prints of Michael Rothenstein by Tessa Sidey,
containing over 500 illustrations, has just been published by the Scolar
Press, Pounds 95.

FT  20 JUL 93 / Arts: Trios - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ST GEORGE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The bonds of marriage are so heavy that it takes two to carry them -
sometimes three. Edmund White's Trios at the Riverside Studios is a
many-sided look at a series of eternal triangles: two men and one woman in
three different situations. It has moments of trenchant drama spread across
a lengthy three-hour span, and worth seeing for the quality of acting alone.
(Biography is what one would normally associate with Edmund White. His
biography of Jean Genet was published this month.)
The first trio is a set of 1980s New York loft dwellers, an impotent artist
with a libidinous actress wife and her gradschool lover. The two men bond
over TV football and The Joy of Cooking. The wife's unexpected jealousies
emerge. The husband concludes, 'You need the love of new people,' the 1980s
version of the comfort of strangers.
The second moves the action to 1920s below-stairs England, where a brutal
chauffeur torments his deaf wife while the horrified young butler looks on.
Eventually, the butler plans to elope with her to Australia, but as they
embrace for the first time, her husband shoots them dead.
The third depicts a 19th-century society hostess who takes up with a student
living in the provinces. The scene in which she leaves her husband is the
most acute of the evening: 'Do you like it, our marriage?' she asks,
challenging him to be direct for once. He unleashes a speech about tact,
instead.
The three pieces are intercut, with furious costume changing on the vast
Riverside stage, and musical divisions from Bach to Lieder to country and
Western. The wish to fall into someone else's arms without falling into
their hands is the principle of each encounter. White's writing is rarely
exciting and rather too well wrought. But the juxtaposition of times works
well enough on stage, and he manages to convey that those words 'I love you'
are the most and least personal one can say, simply because everyone is
intimate in this way.
The acting of Kelly Hunter, Robert Langdon Lloyd and Charles Edwards is
uniformly excellent. Each finds an edge and scope within their characters,
although Hunter has more variety to work from. Simon Usher's direction moves
them around the minimal set in a way that focuses attention on a particular
scene, yet which suggests the possibility of other scenes across the
expansive stage.
The Riverside Studios, Hammersmith, London W6, (071) 748 3354, until July 31

FT  20 JUL 93 / Arts: French Lessons - Promenade Concerts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLEMENTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The BBC Philharmonic Orchestra's contribution to this year's proms is second
only in extent to that of its London sibling the BBC Symphony. The first two
of the Philharmonic's five concerts occupied the Albert Hall on Saturday and
Sunday; the orchestra's Principal Conductor Yan Pascal Tortelier conducted
both of them - a mixed programme of showpieces in the first, Berlioz's
dramatic symphony Romeo et Juliette in the second.
There is no longer any need to emphasise that the BBCPO has shaken off all
suggestions that it is an inferior provincial counterpart of the glamorous
metropolitan bands; the reputation for serious, committed music making
forged under its previous conductor Edward Downes is undoubtedly being
sustained in the quality of tone and ensemble under Tortelier, even though
his tastes in repertory diverge quite sharply from those of his predecessor.
Tortelier unsurprisingly is most at home in French music and the novelty in
the first of these proms was his own orchestration of Ravel's Piano Trio.
Beautifully crafted, if a little on the sweet-toothed side, the trio was
transformed into a four-movement orchestral piece of almost symphonic power
and range, even if that was never enough to displace memories of the
original's intimate and more delicate, subtle poetry. Tortelier followed his
confection with Respighi's Pines of Rome, all Technicolor glitz and glitter
and complete with real nightingales, or rather real recordings of real
nightingales.
What substance there was in the programme was concentrated in the first
half. Cecile Ousset had provided real incisiveness in Rakhmaninov's Paganini
Rhapsody, powering through the bravura and giving the lyrical pools
relatively short shrift, but Tortelier had covered Tchaikovsky's Fantasy
Overture Romeo and Juliet with a heavy romantic impasto, never even
momentarily energising its tensions to provide the necessary dramatic
contrast.
In Berlioz's evening-long treatment of the same theme the next day Tortelier
was generally on surer ground. There was still a tendency to over-cook the
lyrical intensity, verging on mannerism in the slow, precious moulding of
the Love Scene and some slightly too obvious theatrical pauses, but the
faster music moved with elan, and a sureness of texture for which the
orchestra also deserves much credit. The Queen Mab Scherzo came off best of
all, uncomplicated extroversion of the kind which contained no hidden
snares, but the solo instrumental playing was consistently reliable.
The chorus was supplied by the Huddersfield Choral Society, mustering a
convincing dynamic range, though a slightly smaller body of singers might
have offered more flexibility, and the excellent soloists were Marie-Ange
Todorovitch, Anthony Rolfe Jonhson and John Tomlinson. Tomlinson, in
magnificent voice, caught the ear most strikingly; Friar Laurence's
monologue was the evening's highlight, overwhelming in its power and
eloquence.

FT  20 JUL 93 / Arts: Air of limbo in Munich
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
After a year on the move, while algae were removed from the expensive new
hydraulics system in Munich's National Theater, the Bavarian State Opera is
back in its home for the July opera festival, specially extended this year
to six-and-a-half weeks. Wolfgang Sawallisch has gone, Peter Jonas has yet
to arrive. Despite the pleasure of being back in familiar surroundings,
there is an air of limbo. That much was clear from Die Frau ohne Schatten
and Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk, which - along with La traviata, to be staged
later this week by the avant-garde director Gunter Kramer - are the
festival's new productions.
The Strauss was new to Munich, but was first seen last November during the
company's tour of Japan. Its prime motivator was Sawallisch, whose long
association with Japan and admiration for its culture prompted the idea of a
Kabuki interpretation - at first sight quite plausible, given the opera's
pseudo-oriental setting. By the time the production reached Munich, however,
it had lost Sawallisch and two members of the original cast, and the Kabuki
actor-director Ennosuke Ichikawa was not present to restage it. The result
had the taste of a poorly reheated meal.
The visual language of Kabuki (designs by Setsu Asakura and Tomio Mohri)
produced some striking stage pictures in the naive fairy-tale world of the
Emperor: ceremonial costumes, gilded head-dresses and exotic back-cloths,
including an awesome Buddha-like image of the Emperor turning to stone. Most
eloquent of all was the pagoda-setting for the Empress's dream in Act 2,
haunted by a red-plumed human Falcon whose preening gestures would have done
credit to an oriental aviary. True to Kabuki style, the action had a ritual
mime-like quality, and there was some authentic stage magic.
But when it came to characterising the more mundane surroundings of Barak's
world - a mosaic of strip-curtains and the headscarf-and-smock costumes of
central Asian nomads - the Kabuki experiment began to founder. Now needing
to animate the stage according to the rules of European theatre, Ichikawa
had nothing to say. Barak and his entourage had about as much expressive
vitality as paper cut-outs, while the Empress scuttled around like an
outsize, out-of-place geisha. Unlike Jean-Pierre Ponnelle's Cologne
production of the late 1970s, which also took Kabuki as its reference point,
Ichikawa's Frau showed no synthesis of theatrical traditions. At best, it
taught Munich's opera-goers something about Kabuki; at worst, it was an
expensive gimmick, which failed to scratch the surface of this problematic
work.
The cast, dominated by Americans, was unable to make up the deficit - or
justify festival seat-prices. The Kabuki style gave Luana DeVol's Empress
little scope for personality, and she lacked the vocal radiance for the
part. Kenneth Garrison's Emperor, looking like a mobile museum dummy, had a
wretched time with Strauss's awkward tenor writing and was mercilessly
booed. Despite their hamstrung impersonation of Barak and his wife, Alan
Titus and Janis Martin sang well - particularly Miss Martin, who is in
better voice than ever. Reinhild Runkel missed the witch's venom which has
distinguished her Nurse on previous occasions. In the pit, Horst Stein
proved a reliable guide to Strauss's musical architecture and instrumental
delicacies - without matching the fluidity and sense of inexorable sweep
that lifted Sawallisch's performances.
The Shostakovich production, sung in German, at least had in Hildegard
Behrens a singer-actress capable of carrying the show alone. Katerina
Ismailova is a part to which Behrens's talents are perfectly matched: here
was the personification of human vulnerability and frustrated sexuality,
every note and gesture wedded to the heartfelt emotions being expressed.
But what a shapeless, mediocre staging] Too blunt for satire, too
superficial for tragedy, the action unfolded like a cheap catalogue of bonk
and bestiality, punctuated by moments of unintentioned comedy. The German
film director Volker Schlondorff made the fatal mistake of 'choreographing'
Shostakovich's brilliantly descriptive interludes, for some of which the
brass section of the orchestra trooped on stage like a village band -
undermining the already fragile technical control of the conductor, Peter
Schneider. There was no hint of the grotesque, no sense of the epic course
of destiny, no engagement with the work's radical film-like quality - nor
any compensating atmosphere in Viktor Volsky's grey geometric ramps and
gauzes.
Kenneth Riegel proved that Sinovy need not be a wimp to be credible. Donald
McIntyre, with what voice that remains, captured the geriatric randiness of
the despotic Boris. Alfred Kuhn gave a delicious cameo as the degenerate
priest. Kurt Schreibmayer, a handsome blonde Sergey, demanded more of his
light tenor that it had to offer. In all, a limp, misdirected evening.

Britain annually loses 67m working days through back pain, at an estimated
cost of Pounds 3bn, yet one of the lesser-known UK charities is the
25-year-old National Back Pain Association. Its new executive director,
retired Major General Malcolm Hunt, 54, likes to joke that 'having been a
pain in the backside for 35 years in the Royal Marines I felt well-qualified
to do the job'.
He is certainly up to putting backbone into an organisation which has not
been a roaring success at fund-raising having led 40 Commando during the
1982 war with Argentina. His affection for the South Atlantic was such that
his last military appointment was as commander of all three services in the
Falklands and South Georgia. The type of organisational and managerial
skills required for an undersung charity will have been well-honed in
running the bleak Falklands military outpost at Mount Pleasant.
'It's a stimulating subject, with political, medical and business dimensions
to it,' he says. Though total income has grown from Pounds 192,000 in 1991
to about Pounds 475,000 this year, the business community, Hunt feels, is
surprisingly slack about assisting a charity, the results of whose research
much more directly impinge on employment than what he calls the 'cuddly
charities'.
Hunt suffers no back problems himself, though he says: 'There are something
like 20m back-pain sufferers in this country, with 2m-3m chronically
disabled by it. That results in the equivalent of a city the size of
Coventry - about 230,000 people - closing down each day.'

FT  20 JUL 93 / Business and the Law: Scots' complaint - Legal briefs
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Recent complaints by the English Law Commission, the government's law reform
advisory body, that few of its recommendations for legislative change reach
the statute book are echoed by the Scottish Law Commission.
According to Ms Lynne MacMillan, of the Scottish Consumer Council, Scotland
faces the additional disadvantage that, when parliamentary time is found for
Scottish law reform, it is often kept to a minimum by adding Scottish
provisions on to the end of legislation primarily intended for England and
Wales, or gathering issues together into a Law Reform (Miscellaneous
Provisions) (Scotland) Bill.

FT  20 JUL 93 / Business and the Law: Pan Am seeks to recover money from
India - Legal briefs
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Pan American World Airways, in the process of Chapter 11 liquidation in the
US, has launched an action against the Indian government to recover Dollars
3.7m for creditors. The money was frozen in an Indian branch of Citibank
after the airline carried an Indian passenger out of the country who owed
millions in back taxes.
According to the American National Law Journal, the Indian government
blocked the money after Pan Am flew Dr Jayanti Dharma Teja to New York in
1977. Dr Teja owed Pounds 4.5m in taxes and was prohibited from leaving
India. Pan Am accepts that the Indian government warned it that Dr Teja was
grounded, but says it was given insufficient information to trace him. He
was seen off at the airport by Indian officials, including the son of the
then prime minister, and had all the necessary documentation.
The action is the culmination of more than 10 years of efforts by the US
administration and the airline to get the money released.

FT  20 JUL 93 / Business and the Law: Spirit of the entrepreneur - The
solicitor-client relationship is under review
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICK GILLIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lawyers are becoming aware that the high fee-charging of the past is on its
way out.
This was one of the messages at a recent conference for senior solicitors,
Creating the Client-Driven Law Firm, organised by Nottingham Law School's
Centre for Law Firm Management. The conference had some blunt words for
lawyers and some useful ammunition for finance directors.
Lord Alexander of Weedon, QC, chairman of National Westminster Bank, opened
proceedings with a speech packed with home truths. He started with an attack
on hourly rates (the standard method of charging, where solicitors charge by
the hour), which he called 'a charter for overcharging and inefficiency'.
He warmed up with an accusation that solicitors thought marketing was about
creating relationships: they should not be seeking to create 'a warm glow,
but striving for a productive and profitable relationship', he said.
Finally, Lord Alexander asked the lawyers listening to raise their hands if
they would enter into litigation on their own account if they had to fund it
personally. Not one did. 'The cost of litigation is not worth it,' he
agreed.
After Lord Alexander had set the tone, eminent in-house lawyers and legal
management consultants joined in. Even the lawyers admitted things had to
change.
Mr Peter Cole, a member of the management committee of Eversheds, the
national law firm, said: 'You can't say to a client that you don't know how
much it will cost. They will say: 'You say you are an expert - you must have
done this before.' '
One speaker said the logical consequence was that lawyers would have their
income reduced. That, however, was an idea lawyers could not countenance,
although they could contemplate cutting their fees.
Mr Andrew Simkin of Pannone &amp; Partners, a London and Manchester law firm,
said that he had suggested telling clients that, owing to increased
efficiency, the firm would be cutting its fees the following financial year.
His partners thought the clients' reaction would be that they had previously
been overcharged.
This approach to commercial realities proved to be a theme of the
conference. Lawyers, it seemed, were extraordinarily lacking in basic
business sense when it came to their own affairs.
Tough and astute managers of large London practices were enthralled when a
young man from a small Hertfordshire law firm told them how effective hiring
a credit controller at his firm had been. His partners had tried to veto the
idea, because they had feared that chasing the client for money owed would
damage the relationship. In fact, he explained, the controller dealt with
the client's accounts department, not at the director level at which the
lawyer was operating.
It was ironic that lawyers should be coming to terms with line management
techniques just as the world was beginning to adopt the knowledge-based
skills of the professional, said Professor Tom Cannon of Manchester Business
School.
In his vision of the future, the law firm would be a group of experts,
mainly at partner level, who would be aware that their value to a client was
the value they added to the client's transaction.
To many of the lawyers in the audience that sounded like a platitude, but
two important points sprang from it.
The first was that clients were no longer prepared to pay for the services
of junior lawyers who were in effect learning their trade on the job at the
client's expense. 'We are not going to pay Pounds 200 an hour to train your
assistants,' as Ms Katherine Gurun of Bechtel, the engineering and
construction group, put it.
The second was that there needed to be a cultural change, to dissuade
lawyers from doing a perfect job regardless of the time it took and the
cost.
This latter idea, which would be anathema to most lawyers, could be imposed
only by clients. It did not mean clients wanted shoddy work. They simply
wanted lawyers to retain a sense of proportion about what was likely to be
essential.
Mr John Boyd, QC, legal services director of Digital Equipment, the computer
company, explained: 'For core work (mainly intellectual property work) we
expect the highest quality work and are happy to pay very large bills. But
for routine things - property, some litigation, debt - we go for a
satisfactory service at a reasonable price.'
While Mr Boyd knew what he wanted from his outside lawyers, many clients did
not. Conference speakers, both in-house lawyers and management consultants,
made it plain that, in future, lawyers would have to be more entrepreneurial
about assessing the client's wants and needs.
This brought the conference to the issue of marketing - something lawyers
have been allowed to do only for the past five or six years. At one
conference workshop, a managing partner was asked how to ensure that he
retained a corporate client. He said: 'First find out who the Master of the
finance director's (Masonic) Lodge is.' Although clearly meant as a joke,
some did not take it as such.
One managing partner told the conference that the day of the general law
practice was over. He said that, as in other spheres, the market would
divide into 'brand leaders' and 'niche traders'.
Agreement came from two lawyers at opposite ends of the spectrum: Mr Michael
Brown, the managing partner of Waltons &amp; Morse, a small London firm
specialising in shipping and insurance law; and Mr Stuart Benson, of
Leeds-based Dibb Lupton Broomhead, a general commercial law practice with
offices in most of the main commercial centres in England.
Mr Brown asked the conference: 'How often does a client ring up and say: 'I
have a litigation problem'? They don't. They say: 'I have an insurance
problem', 'I have a shipping dispute.' ' He had split his firm into
industry-specific teams, and the generalists were being absorbed into them.
Mr Benson said his dream was to create a law firm based on the categories of
the FT share indices. His reasoning was that 'when people are focused on
specific areas, they automatically market their services'.
All this suggested that many lawyers were beginning to grasp the basics of
management and business development. Delegates to the conference included
senior people from leading UK firms: Clifford Chance and Linklaters &amp; Paines
in the City of London, Osborne Clarke and Eversheds from the regions, for
example. Nevertheless, only 40 of the country's 8,000 law firms had sent
anyone to the conference.
Professor Philip Brown of Nottingham Law School put a brave face on it,
saying the conference was two years ahead of its time. But so small a number
of attendees suggested that lawyers are still not aware of the depth of
client resistance to their profession's old ways.

FT  20 JUL 93 / People: Sir Brian Corby joins board of Pan-Holding
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Brian Corby, chairman of Prudential of the UK and former president of
the CBI, has joined the board of Pan-Holding, a Luxembourg-listed closed-end
investment company run out of Paris and New York by the Philippe family,
grandchildren of co-founder Raymond Philippe.
Director Alain Philippe points out that the company has long had a senior
figure from the Pru on its board, which currently counts 12 part-time
directors of a variety of nationalities. Geoffrey Haslam, 78, deputy
chairman of the Pru between 1980-1984, retired from Pan last December; 'he
told us he thought Sir Brian would be a good replacement,' says Philippe.
Pan-Holding's longstanding chairman, Rowland George, has just died, aged 98.
'He wasn't able to travel in his last year, but the other board members
would go to the US and visit him; he was still very helpful,' says Philippe.
Other current board members include Lord Roll and Sir Siegmund Warburg, a
friend of Alain Philippe's father Pierre, who was on the board from 1958
until his death in 1982.
Pan was set up in 1931, making it one of the oldest continental European
investment vehicles that spread its assets internationally. At the end of
May this year funds under management, on behalf of institutional and retail
investors who want to 'minimise risk in volatile times rather than to chase
indices', according to Philippe, totalled Dollars 315m.

FT  20 JUL 93 / Business and the Law: UK tax rule discriminatory - European
Court
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The European Court of Justice confirmed last week that UK corporation tax
legislation that discriminates against companies with their principal place
of business in another member state is prohibited by Rome Treaty rules on
establishment.
The Court's ruling was in response to a question referred from the English
High Court in the context of a dispute between Commerzbank AG and the UK tax
authorities. Commerzbank, which had its head office in Germany, made loans
to US companies through a UK branch. It paid tax in the UK of Pounds
4,222,234 on the interest earned. Subsequently, it successfully reclaimed
that payment from the UK tax authorities on the ground that the interest was
exempt from tax in the UK pursuant to a UK/US double tax treaty. This
provided that tax was only payable in the UK on interest paid by a US
company to a UK company or a company resident for tax purposes in the UK.
Commerzbank also claimed 'a repayment supplement' of Pounds 5,199,258, equal
to the interest incurred on the overpaid tax under the same provisions. The
tax authorities rejected the claim on the grounds that the company was not
resident in the UK. According to the UK tax rules, the supplement was
generally available only in the case of repayments of corporation tax to a
company resident in the UK.
The ECJ held that a national law of this kind involved unequal treatment
amounting to discrimination in breach of the treaty rules on establishment.
The fact that the exemption from tax which led to the refund was available
only to non-resident companies could not justify a general rule withholding
the benefit on such a discriminatory basis.
Case C-330/911, R v Inland Revenue Commissioners ex parte: Commerzbank AG,
ECJ FC, July 13 1993
Establishment official authority exception
In a reference from the Belgian Raad van State, the ECJ has interpreted the
official authority exception to the right of establishment very strictly in
the context of the Belgian regulation of insurance commissioners appointed
by the Belgian Insurance Control Office.
The Insurance Control Office exercised official authority and the insurance
commissioners were appointed by the office under the same regulations which
governed it. However, the Court found that a 1986 amendment to the
applicable regulations requiring that insurance commissioners be Belgian
nationals was unjustified. Previously, any Community national qualified.
Moreover, the duties of the commissioner were, in terms of financial
scrutiny, no different from those of others with no official authority and,
when directly linked to the powers of the Insurance Control Office, always
subject to final determination by the office itself.
Case C-42/92, Thijssen v Controledienst voor de verzekeringen, ECJ 5CH, July
13 1993
Employment contract jurisdiction
In a reference from the Chambery Court of Appeal, the ECJ has clarified the
application of the special jurisdiction provisions in the Brussels
Convention relating to employment contract disputes. The Court held that,
where an employee performs his contract of employment in more than one
contracting state, the place where the obligation characterising the
contract is performed is that where, or from which, the employee principally
carries out his obligations.
In deciding the place of performance, which was for the national court to
determine, the relevant facts of the case had to be taken into account.
Accordingly, Mr Geels, the international marketing director of UK company
Mulox IBC Limited, correctly brought his claim for compensation for the
termination of his employment in the French courts. His residence from which
he carried out his duties was in France; and his duties, previously
performed in Germany and Holland, were ultimately performed exclusively in
France.

FT  20 JUL 93 / Technology: Corporate computing seeks safe pair of hands -
IT security after the Virgin affair
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When it emerged that British Airways employees had accessed Virgin Atlantic
computer data to poach customers and analyse route profitability, it was not
just the airline industry which was shocked.
Virgin had contracted out its information technology work to British Airways
in a typical example of the practice known as facilities management (FM).
Since this kind of arrangement is increasingly common across many different
industrial sectors, who else faces this sort of risk?
FM involves a third party taking over a client's computing needs, with the
user then left to carry on with his original business. The outside
contractor can supply its own personnel, or inherit the IT staff from the
client. Either way, the user is spared the chore of hunting down and
retaining scarce computer professionals.
The practice began in the 1980s when some large organisations felt they were
being diverted from their main objectives as budgets and personnel were
swallowed up in the rise of IT. Banks in particular saw the IT department
grow in significance to a point where computing threatened to become a core
business in itself.
The rising cost of keeping up with technology and the sense that IT was
acquiring a disproportionate importance within organisations demanded a
practical solution. The services sector within the IT industry spotted an
opportunity and was quick to supply it. FM was born.
From the start, hiving off the human and technical headaches of running a
large computer system was seen as a big step. How far could an outside
contractor be trusted? The FM industry maintained the integrity of third
parties was practically guaranteed. For an IT contractor to abuse
confidentiality would be suicidal.
The airline industry was one of the first to adopt FM in a big way, with
many carriers contracting out the task of running computerised reservation
systems (CRSs). It takes millions of lines of code and large mainframe
computers to process passenger and load data.
British Airways has acknowledged expertise in the CRS field, which is why
Virgin Airlines stores booking and flight load data on the British Airways
Booking System (Babs).
Other airlines do the same. British Midland Airways has recently renewed its
contract with Babs. But the Virgin affair forced BMA to study security
closely. BMA demanded that BA chairman Sir Colin Marshall gave a written
undertaking that client security would be respected. But BMA also opted for
a more concrete policy. The most commercially sensitive passenger
information is kept in off-line computer systems that cannot be accessed via
Babs. This secure database can only be interrogated through BMA's terminals.
Des Butler, manager of agency automation at BMA, explains: 'We've every
confidence in the BA people we deal with, but you have to keep some things
at a remove.' He adds that professional respect does not mean letting down
one's guard in an infamously competitive sector.
Banks were also quick to move into FM - as both suppliers and users of
third-party IT services.
Barclays Computer Operations (BCO) was spun off when its parent bank decided
to cash in on its IT experience. Tony Tatton-Brown, senior sales manager at
BCO, points out his company's banking background means confidentiality is to
the fore. BCO's clients can expect the same level of security as Barclays'
customers. And Tatton-Brown thinks that should apply to any user of FM
services. 'Once you say you're in the service business, you simply cannot
entertain the concept of ever looking at user data.'
Barclays is also an FM customer. Olivetti has a Pounds 100m contract to
manage computer and banking equipment right across Barclays' branch network.
Barclays uses very few Olivetti systems. But in one move, it has replaced
more than 200 maintenance contracts for vital technical support with one
contractor. Olivetti handles the various equipment providers and Barclays
gets on with banking.
Other computer hardware makers are rushing to diversify into service
provision. Unisys, for example, is exploiting years of experience building
large banking systems to set up shop as a financial systems house. It
already manages and maintains electronic branch equipment for the Trustee
Savings Bank and won FM business worth Pounds 40m in 1992. Since Unysis and
Olivetti are firmly rooted in the IT industry, they are hardly potential
competitors of clients. But how worried should the FM world be about farming
out responsibility for sensitive information?
Electronic Data Systems (EDS) cut its teeth in FM and grew into a worldwide
computer services empire. Alan Stevens, EDS UK marketing manager, believes
FM contracts must leave no room for doubt. 'The crucial issue is that both
the supplier and customer enter into an agreement that protects not only
their interests but also covers ethics.'
The Computer Services Association is the relevant industry body and its code
of conduct is unequivocal in respect of FM suppliers. Proper security for
clients is imperative. But industry bodies proliferate in the IT industry.
Blue chip companies such as British Steel and Barclays Bank have joined the
European Security Forum (ESF). They meet to swap information on security and
British Airways is a participant.
A somewhat embarrassed ESF suggests that Virgin failed to appreciate the
true commercial value of data held on computer. In other words, do not rely
on the honour of your IT contractors.
Virgin is reviewing its exposure to third-party IT support. It might be
unjust to apply Butler's suspicion across the world of FM, but Virgin
discovered that computers can prove a soft underbelly.

FT  20 JUL 93 / Technology: Wired for trade in Singapore - The island's
electronic efficiency
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LARRY DONOVAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In Singapore, the thrusting island state which has one of the busiest ports
in the world, the daily pace of international commerce is being speeded up
by electronics.
Instead of wading through mounds of paper, users of its TradeNet system  - a
nationwide electronic data interchange network (EDI) linking manufacturers,
shipping agents, freight forwarders, traders and government agencies - can
cut hours and even days off the processing of import and export deals. By
saving time, they also save money.
Since governments and companies around the world are constantly seeking ways
of staying competitive in tough markets, Singapore has obtained an extra
technological edge with TradeNet which has significantly increased the
efficiency of trading in Singapore. Under the system, a user can send an
electronic document to relevant government agencies and have it returned
with approvals within half an hour.
A cargo agent who receives within minutes his 'electronic approvals' for
import and export declarations can handle consignments for customers on
short notice, while a competitor would have to wait two or three days for
written approvals from various government departments. The
computer-to-computer exchange of business documents also allows agents to
deliver goods upon arrival, eliminating warehousing costs for temporary
storage.
The sharp rise in efficiency and productivity with the use of EDI is
benefiting the financial performance of many Singapore companies. Although
there has not been a detailed study on the benefits of TradeNet, Pearleen
Chan, managing director of Singapore Network Services, responsible for the
state's electronic network services, told a recent conference in Vancouver
that the success of TradeNet translated into savings of SDollars 1bn a year
for the trading community.
That success stems from humble beginnings. In 1988, with an initial
investment of USDollars 10m (Pounds 6.6m), the Singapore government set up a
state-owned company to operate the network. Fifty companies were included in
the early stages, but the group grew so quickly that TradeNet became
self-financing through user fees. In two and a half years, most of the old
government service counters had been shut down because of companies going
electronic.
Chan says the competitive advantage TradeNet brings the Singapore trading
community is so marked that 'if you are not in it, you are out of business'.
The principles of TradeNet are now being extended to other areas including
the medical, legal, real estate and construction sectors. One application in
particular is gaining attention - a local shipping network called PortNet.
Singapore has one of the most active deep-water harbours in the world and
PortNet allows businesses to screen vessel arrivals, departures and berthing
schedules. It also gives shippers the chance to track cargo electronically
in the port area.
Singapore is also making important EDI links beyond its borders. TradeNet is
linked to the Customs Automated Commercial System (ACS) in the US to assist
in the pre-clearance of cargo at its port of destination. In the shipment of
textiles, for example, a test project is under way which permits the
Singapore government to transmit data on their export licences to US
customs. On arrival of the imports, the licence must match the information
sent by the Singapore government; if there are any discrepancies the cargo
is not released.
Elizabeth Durant, acting director of ACS, says the pilot project has
produced excellent results. A formal evaluation with the Singapore
government on the mutual benefits of the system has been completed and ACS
is waiting for the state department to make the formal agreement with
Singapore.
Durant says Singapore was the pilot 'in every sense', especially in the
technical area. Now the infrastructure is in place, her agency would like
more countries to be added. 'It is a great improvement for us,' she
comments. 'It's definitely a permanent thing.'
Singapore has also completed a pilot project to connect with a network in
the Netherlands run by Intis, a privately held company affiliated with the
Rotterdam Port Authority. Willen Van Hezik, director of research at Intis,
says the reaction from the participants in the project was positive and both
parties are working on new business cases to use the EDI link that has been
established.
The success of Singapore's TradeNet has caught the attention of those
working in EDI circles and government planners, in particular in south-east
Asia. Its status as one of the top players in EDI often gives Singapore an
opportunity to fulfil a consulting role to help other countries connect to
global electronic networks.
This is not an easy task. Chan doubts whether any particular model can be
lifted wholesale and implemented in different countries. 'A lot depends on
the culture, the ability of people to work together.' She points to 20
government agencies and various trade associations that co-operated to
establish TradeNet.
Hassan Ansary, executive vice-president of Ports Canada, agrees. Singapore
is often seen as having a government that imposes its direction on its
citizens rather than working by what Ansary calls the 'consensus building'
process that is part of the political make-up of many other nations.
But whatever its politics, Singapore has achieved an impressive competitive
advantage through the astute use of information technology. Ansary does not
feel that Singapore is getting more credit than it deserves. He says the
island nation is setting standards in different areas and they are at the
EDI frontier. Ansary is certain that EDI is the wave of the future, the
question being who will be in the best position to capitalise on it.
As for the future of TradeNet, Chan says the Singapore government likes what
it sees and notes the technology is moving so rapidly that the 'name of the
game is to stay one step ahead'. The next step is now being taken; the
government plans to link electronically all homes, government agencies and
businesses into a fully networked society.

FT  20 JUL 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Banking on training
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bank managers in Germany and the Netherlands take greater account of
management experience, entrepreneurial skills, training and qualifications
than their British counterparts when assessing business propositions.
British bank managers, in contrast, place greater weight on financial
criteria when assessing risk.
These are among the findings of a three-country study of financing practices
in the West Midlands, Baden-Wurttemberg and Twente by researchers from the
University of Central England Business School.
In Germany, in particular, bank managers were able to call on a range of
additional information when assessing business plans. There was a high level
of networking between business support organisations and rival banks.
It is probably more difficult to get started in Baden-Wurttemberg because
entrepreneurs are required to provide much more information to potential
backers, but it is likely that start-ups are of a higher quality than in the
UK, the researchers suggested. Partly because bank managers have more
information about the businesses they back they are able to be more generous
in their funding. In the West Midlands bankers were uncomfortable with
gearing ratios of more than 1:1 while ratios of 2:1 were normal in Twente
and as high as 5:1 in Baden-Wurttemberg.
The UK venture capital sector is more highly developed in the UK but equity
finance is often not available in the small amounts needed. In Germany
equity is available from local stock exchanges, private investors and the
banks.
The study suggests policies which could be adopted in the West Midlands:
closer co-operation between chambers of commerce, banks, colleges and local
authorities; broader training by the banks to emphasise the importance of
management skills; increased publicity for specialist funding schemes for,
for example, high-tech firms.

Development Week in Atlanta, Georgia on September 25.
The agency expects to take a dozen UK business managers to Atlanta for up to
10 days at a cost of about Pounds 1,500 each. Previous visits have led to
orders being placed for UK products. The mission is open to business owners
from throughout the UK.

FT  20 JUL 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Stamping out the
forgeries - In a Nutshell
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Barclays Bank says it intercepted more than Pounds 1.7m worth of counterfeit
banknotes in 1992 and has issued a seven-point checklist to help small
businesses to detect forgeries.
Even if a business accepts a note in good faith, it could lose money because
the law requires it to be handed to the police.
Ultra-violet lamps are not fool-proof since notes which have been in contact
with recently washed clothes may fluoresce while fakes printed on
ultra-violet dull paper will not. Notes in a reasonable condition should be
crisp and not limp, shiny or waxy. The print should be clear and not blurred
or hazy. Notes should contain a continuous thread embedded in the paper.
The watermark should be hardly noticeable until the note is held up to the
light when a portrait becomes visible. Notes of Pounds 10 and Pounds 20 are
the most popular forgeries, Barclays warned.

Business Link has been chosen by the UK government as the brand name for
Britain's network of one-stop shops, advice centres which bring together the
skills and information bases of Training and Enterprise Councils, chambers

The Department of Trade and Industry is known to have been unhappy about the
down-market image created by the term 'one-stop shop'.
The government has also approved a seventh pilot scheme, in Leicestershire.
There are plans to establish a set of accreditation criteria to ensure the
centres provide a high-quality service.

FT  20 JUL 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Read this, you need to
know it - Tips on how to ensure your press release does not end up in the
wastepaper bin
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WALTER BRUDERER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Is this article important?
That is the first question editors and writers ask when they pick up a press
release and start reading. And the conclusion they reach will determine
whether they read on or toss the release aside. The writer has one paragraph
 -perhaps 20 seconds - to seize the reader's attention or lose it.
Important means this: the article is based on a development that the
publication's readers will find interesting because it matters to them and
is new.
So when submitting a press release, ask yourself how your new product,
improved service or reduced price, for example, could be important from the
publication's point of view and then write your press release to emphasise
that importance.
As a golden rule before sitting down to compose a press release, make sure
you have something worthwhile to say.
Of equal importance is to tackle the main point immediately - in the first
paragraph. And make it with absolute clarity. Editors and writers will judge
your article in a matter of seconds and what they are looking for are facts.
Many press releases are not used because the central idea is flimsy and
unimportant. It puffs up an organisation but has no benefit for the reader.
To cover up this critical flaw, the writer often commits another mistake -
he or she resorts to fancy writing. Editors and writers have no time to
untangle any tricky phrasing. They spot it at a glance, run out of patience
and your press release goes in the wastepaper basket.
It does not take long for you to acquire a reputation as an inexperienced
amateur, to be safely ignored by editors and writers.
A point just touched on is worth a bit of emphasis: once you have decided
what is important, get to the point fast. Say it in the first paragraph.
Let's say you have 100 words to convince the reader. So make your point
quickly, with every word meaningful and clear.
Here are 13 rules to guide you:
Make sure your subject is important to the readers of the publication to
which you will send your release.
Present the essential facts immediately, in the first paragraph.
Search for a simple, straightforward style, so your information will be easy
to follow and understand. Clarity is an absolute must. Fancy, pretentious
writing can only obscure your message.
Try to personalise your press release by quoting an authority in your
organisation. This breathes life into the article. But make sure the quoted
person says something important to help move the story along and,
incidentally, to make him or her look authoritative.
If this person cannot say anything interesting or pertinent, do not use him
or her.
If your press release mentions a new rate sheet, brochure, or book, be sure
to enclose a copy.
Keep companies, columnists, business editors and writers on separate mailing
lists. Each has a different point of view and different needs, so tailor
your stories to fit each group.
If your press release refers to an important coming event, which editors and
writers might cover, send it far enough in advance so that they can make
plans. Freelances need time to query editors, and editors appreciate time to
make arrangements.
A last-minute press release, on the other hand, may pose so many problems
that editors and writers may decide it is not convenient to attend.
Timing is often the difference between success and failure.
Keep mailing lists up-to-date and weed out duplicates. Nobody likes to
receive a press release addressed to a predecessor. And a mistake of that
kind marks you as careless and unprofessional.
A sample sheet showing photos available, with a request form, helps the
editor and writer choose exactly what they want. This saves you the
considerable expense of sending big collections of mass-produced photos, 90
per cent of which would never be used.
Do not label your press releases as 'special', 'personal', or 'exclusive'
unless they really are. Writers or editors who have been led to believe that
they have received an exclusive story can only be angry when they discover
that your promise is not true.
And using these words recklessly brands you as an unsophisticated performer
whose work should be regarded sceptically.
It is obvious, but needs emphasising, that every release should have a
specific release date - such as August 10, 1993. It is not good practice to
use 'immediate release' because this allows one editor to use it ahead of
another, and sometimes that can be embarrassing.
Always include the name of your organisation's contact person, plus
telephone and fax numbers. At the end of your press release, add this: 'If I
can be of further help, please call.'
It is often true that editors and writers need additional facts or wish to
explore a different angle, and they appreciate your willingness to help.
Next time you write a press release, check it against these rules.
Then, to be on the safe side, check it once more against the golden rule
above.
If you pass that test, you are well on the way to getting your release read
and used.

FT  20 JUL 93 / Roadshow aims to help industry 'pick winners'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT is to send a research and development roadshow around the
country this autumn to drum up support among industrialists and academics
for the science and technology white paper it published in May.
The roadshow is the first stage in establishing a Technology Foresight
Programme, intended to make recommendations on which areas of research and
development companies should concentrate.
The programme's findings will also be used to direct grants by research
councils, such as the Medical Research Council, and may affect product
standards and regulations.
Mr Grahame Walshe, head of the technology foresight unit at the Office of
Science and Technology, said the intention was 'to maximise the possibility
that industry will pick (technological) winners'.
Mr Howard Davies, director-general of the Confederation of British Industry,
warned the government that 'winner picking' should be conducted by industry,
not the government.
Mr William Waldegrave, science minister, said at a CBI workshop on the white
paper yesterday that the roadshow 'will be used to explain the concept of
foresight and to develop a commitment to the programme across all sectors of
the community'.
The Focus on Foresight seminars are scheduled for September and October in
England, and will take place in Manchester; the Midlands; Swindon,
Wiltshire; and London. There will also be seminars in Scotland, Wales and
Northern Ireland. Industrialists, academics, consumer bodies and the public
sector will be invited, Mr Waldegrave said.
He added: 'We need to build (a) more intimate, regular and structured
contact between the scientist and engineer at the bench and the
industrialist. This will enable us to tap into the expertise of people
closest to emerging scientific, technological and market developments.'
In the next few weeks the government will appoint panels of experts in areas
such as chemicals and information technology. The panels, which will be the
core of the technology foresight programme, will next year identify 'generic
technologies' - those with the potential to be used across a variety of
products and processes - that British industry is in a good position to
exploit.
The panels will probably publish recommendations on developments over
10-year and 20-year time scales.
Industrialists at the CBI workshop generally welcomed the move, but others
warned that the search for promising technologies should not be limited to
the UK.

FT  20 JUL 93 / Cellnet to cut call charges within M25 area
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CELLNET, the mobile phone operator, is to cut its tariffs within the M25
area to match growing price competition from rivals.
Vodafone, the largest operator, last month announced a 25 per cent price
reduction for peak-rate calls within the M25 area, reducing its charge per
minute to customers from about 33p to 25p. Cellnet is likely to make a
similar reduction soon.
The moves come ahead of the launch later this summer of the Mercury
One-2-One mobile service within the M25 area, which is expected to offer a
peak-rate tariff of less than 20p a minute.
Mr Stafford Taylor, Cellnet managing director, said his company's research
showed that 70 per cent of users located within the M25 made the majority of
their calls to other destinations in the area.
Mr Taylor said: 'We are therefore developing a service that offers lower
charges within the M25, while giving customers the freedom to use their
cellphones throughout the UK' - a reference to the restricted coverage of
Mercury One-2-One.
He also announced the launch of a regional and national digital service
early next year to compete with a similar service Vodafone is starting this
autumn.
Although Vodafone has a larger overall market share, Cellnet has made
significant strides this year with its low-user 'Lifetime' tariff, and is
anxious to keep its edge in the forthcoming battle for low-tariff customers
using regional networks.
Cellnet says it has 140,583 customers for its low-user service, which
charges a Pounds 15 monthly subscription and 50p a minute peak rate,
compared with 108,558 customers for Vodafone's equivalent service.
Cellnet is considering incentives for frequent callers, which may include
discounts on existing and new services.

FT  20 JUL 93 / Sales boost retail volumes: CBI sounds cautious note on
'patchy' improvement in figures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN EARLY start to summer discount sales underpinned the sixth monthly rise
in retail sales in June, with the largest shops benefiting most from buoyant
consumer activity.
The Confederation of British Industry reported yesterday that in the year to
June, sales volumes grew at their fastest rate since April 1990.
The percentage balance of those retailers reporting an increase in sales
minus those reporting a fall, rose to 30 per cent compared with 18 per cent
in May and minus 3 per cent in June last year.
Yet Mr Nigel Whittaker, chairman of the CBI's distributive trades panel,
said the recent improvement in retail trade was 'patchy', with smaller chain
stores and single shops reporting trade levels still below those of last
year.
'Though retailers expect a further increase in July, we need to be cautious
as expectations have not been fully met in previous surveys,' he said.
The news was less encouraging for motor traders. They reported falling sales
for the second month in succession compared with a year ago, confounding
earlier expectations of a rise.
The CBI, in its monthly distributive trades survey, reported that as a
result of the drop in car sales, orders placed with suppliers have been
reduced and stock levels remain 'adequate' to meet expected demand.
Wholesalers fared particularly well in June. Sales rose for the fourth
consecutive month and were above normal for the time of year.
The survey, conducted between June 15 and July 7, covered 15,000 outlets in
retailing, wholesaling and motor trading. Its findings also included: Orders
and stocks. Although orders placed by retailers with suppliers have been
increasing at a slower rate than the volume of sales, the level of stocks
has risen. The balance of retailers reporting that the level of stocks in
relation to expected demand is more than adequate has risen from 14 per cent
to 26 per cent. Stock levels were described by retailers as the most
'excessive' since April last year, suggesting a degree of caution about
future sales.
Food and drink. Grocers reported a sharp increase in sales in the year to
June, as indicated by a strong balance of 43 per cent. They reported sales
to be above normal for the time of year for the first time in 12 months.
Off-licences reported another significant fall in sales in the year to June.
Sales have fallen sharply for every month in the past year. The CBI said
off-licences have been gradually losing market share to supermarkets, an
effect compounded this year by big price reductions in the larger stores.
Clothing and footwear. There was a substantial increase in clothing sales in
the year to June, although shoe shops reported an even greater increase. In
spite of the good performance last month, both sectors report sales below
normal for the time of year.
Chemists. This sector continued to report an improvement in sales, and
increased the orders placed with suppliers in the year to June.
Household goods. After a strong monthly performance, sales are now slightly
above normal for the time of year.

FT  20 JUL 93 / Pru chief urges talks on fees disclosure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Mick Newmarch, chief executive of Prudential Corporation, the UK's
largest life insurance company, has called on the Office of Fair Trading to
have direct discussions with the life insurance industry on disclosure.
In March the OFT attacked a proposal from the Securities and Investments
Board and other City self-regulatory organisations for the life insurance
industry, saying it contained seriously anti-competitive elements.
The OFT urged that independent financial advisers be required to disclose
the amount of commission they will earn from prospective customers, that
life insurers should spell out the surrender value in each year of a
policy's life until maturity, that the effect of costs in investment returns
be demonstrated by using each company's own charges, and that low-cost sales
outlets be allowed to charge less for the same product than high-cost
outlets.
In a seven-page letter to the OFT last week Mr Newmarch took issue with its
proposals and said the self-regulating organisations should have no role in
deciding on disclosure rules.
'The primary relationship needs to be with the industry - represented by
leading practitioners and its trade associations - not with the regulatory
bodies,' he wrote.
He said the price comparison data which the OFT sought would probably be of
little use.
'The provision of comparative performance data is less important to saver
protection than transparency on the terms which will govern the build-up of
value in the product, and the policyholder's access to the funds built up,'
he said.
Mr Newmarch proposes that sales agents be required to disclose the
customer's contractual obligation to pay premiums, the terms governing the
build-up of policy proceeds and customer access to them, the charges which
apply to the separate elements of the contract such as investment management
or life insurance premiums, and the basis for determining charges.

FT  20 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Lib Dems split over Maastricht
strategy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A DIVISION among Liberal Democrat MPs last night over tactics for Thursday's
Maastricht debate offered the government a possible lifeline in its efforts
to avoid a defeat at the hands of Euro-sceptic Tories.
Sir Russell Johnston, the Liberal Democrats' Europe spokesman, suggested his
party's MPs might vote with the government to save the Maastricht treaty if
Labour failed in its attempt to force Britain to accept the social chapter.
A final decision by the 21 Liberal Democrat MPs will not be taken before
tomorrow or possibly pending fresh legal advice on the implications of
defeating the government. Sir Russell said, however: 'If the Labour
amendment is defeated I think that the likelihood is that we will vote with
the government - but it's not 100 per cent.'
His comments were at odds with aides to Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal Democrat
leader, who said the party would vote against the government on both of
Thursday's votes: the first on Labour's amendment backing the social chapter
and the second on the government motion noting its opposition to the social
chapter.
The importance of the apparent rift is that Liberal Democrat support for the
government on the second vote would force Tory Euro-sceptic MPs to
concentrate on the first vote if they want to inflict a defeat on the
government. They would have to vote for the social chapter rather than just
against the government.
The clash came as Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, again
urged Unionist MPs to back the government, saying the province needed the
social chapter 'like a hole in the head'. He is expected to meet Unionists
on Thursday and appeared unwilling to rule out attempting to strike a deal.
The three Democratic Unionist party MPs led by the Rev Ian Paisley announced
they would vote against the government - except possibly if the government
made a complete U-turn and abandoned the 1985 Anglo-Irish agreement.
But the nine Ulster Unionist MPs will not decide how to vote until Thursday.
They have not agreed tactics and although some want to back the Tory
Euro-sceptics, others want to use the chance to force government concessions
on Northern Ireland policy.
Liberal Democrats want to put maximum pressure on the government to reverse
Britain's social chapter opt-out but also do not want to wreck the treaty.
Thus the party would be in a quandary if Labour's amendment were defeated.
To then vote against the unamended government motion could mean no
resolution being passed - possibly preventing ratification.
Mr Ashdown wrote to Mr John Major, the prime minister, yesterday saying
Liberal Democrats 'would use our votes in whatever way we felt would give
Britain the best chance of being inside the social chapter'. He said that
was the only way that Britain would be able to influence the development of
the European social and employment policies.

FT  20 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Whips turn heat on Tory rebels
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HARDLINE TORY Euro-sceptics were yesterday under mounting pressure not to
vote with Labour in the first of Thursday's votes on Maastricht's social
chapter as the government turned up the heat in its efforts to stave off
defeat.
But it appeared last night that more than enough sceptics were prepared to
support Labour's amendment backing the social chapter - or to abstain - to
overturn the government's 18-strong majority.
If they stick to this position ministers would be forced into a deal with
one or more of the opposition parties - probably the Ulster Unionists - to
salvage a chance of victory.
If the Unionists vote with the government, the number of rebels needed to
carry the Labour amendment would rise to 19. If the Unionists abstain, 14
Tory rebels would be enough to defeat the government.
Pressure was last night being brought to bear on the Euro-sceptic hardliners
from at least three different directions: constituency associations,
government business managers and even some fellow Euro-sceptics.
Mr Michael Carttiss, the Tory MP for Great Yarmouth who frequently defied
government whips during the Maastricht bill's Commons committee stage, said
last night: 'I have argued with one or two (Euro-sceptics) in the last week
and they were firm that by voting for the Labour amendment they would stymie
the treaty.'
Mr Carttiss said it was beyond his comprehension how Euro-sceptics could
consider supporting the social chapter.
Hardline sceptics meanwhile emerged tight-lipped from a 'secret' afternoon
meeting. 'We want to keep our powder dry,' said one.
In a further indication that the government is taking no chances in its
battle for ratification, the whips yesterday circulated a letter to
backbenchers asking for full details of their whereabouts during the summer
recess.

FT  20 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: MPs condemn move to limit education
bill debate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR leaders kept MPs trooping through the lobbies in the Commons last
night in a series of divisions as a protest against action taken by the
government to limit debate on 580 Lords amendments to the education bill.
Mrs Ann Taylor, shadow education secretary, justified the voting manoeuvre
on the grounds that the government had failed to provide adequate time for
changes made to the bill by the Lords to be properly scrutinised.
She said: 'We may be gagged but we can use our votes.'
Earlier the government secured a majority of 66 (288-222) for a guillotine
motion limiting debate on the Lords amendments to a total of 8 1/2 hours.
Defending the move, Mr Eric Forth, junior education minister, stressed that
MPs had already spent 150 hours discussing the bill.
The government, he said, wanted the bill to secure royal assent by the end
of the month so that it could become operative with the start of the new
school year in September.
Mr Forth insisted the reforms provided by the bill - including opportunities
for more schools to attain grant-maintained status so they were no longer
subject to control by local education authorities - should not be further
delayed.
He said: 'For too long too many schools have simply shrugged their shoulders
at the problems which are clearly besetting them and causing them to fail to
give their pupils an acceptable standard of education.' He emphasised that
rather more than half of the Lords amendments were of a technical or
'tidying-up' character.
Mrs Taylor protested that by restricting debate on the Lords amendments to
about 8 1/2 hours the government was reducing the proceedings in the Commons
'to a farce'.
She said: 'It is totally outrageous and unacceptable to have a timetable of
this kind imposed at this stage.'
Accusing ministers of arrogance, she stressed some amendments could become
law without a word being spoken on them in the Commons.
The limited time available for debating the amendments was also criticised
by Mr Alan Howarth, Tory MP for Stratford-upon-Avon, a former education
minister.
Mr Howarth said the move to limit debate was 'particularly unsatisfactory'
because of the 'enormously important' proposals on sex education.
'It seems inevitable that we shall not have a chance to debate or to vote
separately on this extremely important issue and I do regard that as
extraordinary.'

FT  20 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Conservative foot-soldiers threaten
to desert - Philip Stephens finds pensioners in Christchurch ready to give
the government a by-election drubbing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THEY ARE grey or greying. Typically they can rely on a manageable but less
than extravagant income from running the local shop or from an occupational
pension and the interest on Pounds 10,000 or Pounds 15,000 in the local
building society. They are homeowners, thrifty and conservative by instinct.
They are also enraged by the performance and policies of Mr John Major's
government. In 10 days the retired and near-retired of one of England's Tory
heartlands plan to take their revenge in the Christchurch by-election.
The prime minister will no doubt brush off defeat as a familiar case of
mid-term blues. Governments cannot expect to win by-elections in such
febrile times. But Mr Major should beware. The loss of Christchurch would
carry with it a much more worrying message for his administration.
The government has fallen from favour with one of the electorate's most
powerful interest groups. Mr Major's policies - on taxation, welfare
spending, deregulation and privatisation - are out of tune with the
interests and aspirations of the greying classes.
It will take more than a gentle economic upturn to persuade the once-loyal
battalions of southern England pensioners to return to the Tory fold. And
without them the Conservatives cannot win elections.
If the present mood in the sleepy east Dorset constituency provides anything
like an accurate snapshot of the eventual outcome, the Conservatives will be
trounced on July 29. A once impregnable Tory majority of 23,000 is
collapsing.
The recession, the imposition of value added tax on domestic fuel, the
threatened squeeze on health and social security spending, rising crime,
rail privatisation and the promised deregulation of Sunday trading have all
taken their toll.
Things could change. But despite the formidable campaigning talents of Mr
Rob Hayward, the Conservative candidate, it is impossible to find anyone in
the constituency forecasting they will. When the stalwarts of the local
British Legion, Tories all, declare a new-found allegiance to the Liberal
Democrats it is hard not to believe that the government's game is up.
Christchurch - as journalists covering the by-election are reminded
constantly and with some irritation by its younger voters - is not populated
entirely by pensioners.
Only a third of the 71,000 electorate is above the retirement age. Inland
from the bungalows strung like a necklace along the coast, the constituency
boasts a burgeoning population of young families. But the elderly and the
middle-aged have provided the backbone of Conservative support in an area
which has voted for the same party at every election since 1910.
Now they are defecting in droves to Mrs Diana Maddock, the sensible, careful
and middle-aged Liberal Democrat. Grey power has come of age.
The national statistics tell part of the story. Since 1971 the number of
voters of pensionable age has risen 16 per cent to 10.6m. They now represent
more than one-fifth of the electorate. That proportion will rise inexorably
over the next 30 years, reaching about a quarter by 2021.
Precise figures for the share-out of their votes are elusive but opinion
polling data suggest that nearly half voted Conservative in the 1992 general
election. About a third - heavily concentrated among those reliant on the
state pension and other welfare benefits - supported Labour. The remainder
backed the Liberal Democrats.
But the bald statistics underestimate the reliance of the Conservatives on
the older population - both in terms of its party organisation and its
performance at elections.
If Christchurch overstates their influence, the pensioner vote holds
disproportionate and increasing sway in the Tory heartland of southern
England. The modestly affluent elderly provide the foot-soldiers of local
Tory associations. They are the envelope-stuffers, the jam-makers and the
fete-organisers of the party.
The outcry over the extension of VAT, over talk of new National Health
Service charges, over the prospective squeeze on funding for nursing home
care and for invalidity benefit has underlined their disillusionment with Mr
Major's agenda.
A switch from direct to indirect taxation holds little attraction for those
on fixed or semi-fixed incomes. Pledges that the poorest pensioners will be
protected from higher heating charges cut little ice with those just above
income support levels. The threat of cuts in invalidity and other benefits
which are not means-tested confirms the impression that the government is
determined to penalise the thrifty.
Nor are grey voters enthused by deregulation of Sunday trading,
privatisation of British Rail and the promised sale of the Post Office.
Instead Mr Major's enthusiasm for Thatcherite supply-side economics spells
the end of the village post office, the closure of the local grocery and
cuts in rural train services. Baroness Thatcher would have understood that.
Her successor, it seems, is about to learn it the hard way.

ABOUT two thirds of the 651 MPs this year authorised payments from their
Office Costs Allowances direct to companies or other organisations,
including constituency associations, Mr Tony Newton, leader of the House,
said last night.
He was responding to Mr Bob Cryer (Lab Bradford S), a member of the

secretarial allowance paid into private limited companies'.
MPs may claim up to Pounds 40,380 a year on the allowance.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
CONSERVATIVE MP Mr Winston Churchill last night repeated his call for a halt
to further immigration.
'If we are to curb the scourge of racism in our society we must first and
foremost stop adding to the problem.
'The government must act - and urgently - if in the years ahead we are to
avoid in our own cities the sort of ethnic violence we have witnessed in
Germany, or worse,' he said.
Mr Nigel Griffiths, Labour MP for Edinburgh South, called for Mr Churchill
to be expelled from the Conservative party. 'There is no point in the prime
minister saying he disagrees with Mr Churchill if he takes no action to
distance the Tory party from his views.
'He should do this by withdrawing the whip and telling the country he may
not stand again as a Tory candidate.'

PRIVATE security firms could be employed to assist British Transport Police

Similar arrangements already applied at Britain's ports and airports, he

Ministers could require railway companies to 'employ specified numbers of

FT  20 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Smith wins vote backing at NEC
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR'S ruling national executive committee last night endorsed
controversial proposals by party leader Mr John Smith for
one-member-one-vote in the selection of parliamentary candidates.
The NEC voted by 20 votes to seven in favour of the 'consensus' Mr Smith
said was achieved at a meeting between Labour MPs and union representatives
last week.
But the decision makes it more likely the leadership will face a battle at
the party's annual conference in September, since some of Britain's largest
unions including the GMB and the TGWU have made clear they are still opposed
to parts of the plan.
The trade union reform group's report would form the basis of rule changes
to be put to the conference. Mr Smith said at the end of the meeting: 'I
recommend (the proposals) to the party and believe (they) will greatly
strengthen both Labour party democracy and the links between the Labour
party and the trade unions and their members.'
But NEC member Mr Dan Duffy, chairman of the TGWU general union, said: 'As
far as we're concerned the present proposals will reduce the links and will
emasculate the trade union movement.'
He added: 'If the proposals are still the same as they are at present, we
will be arguing against them.'

FT  20 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Costs of EC laws to be published
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE COSTS to business of complying with European Community legislation are
to be highlighted by ministers as part of the deregulation initiative.
The aim is to focus attention within the government and more generally on
the costs of meeting EC requirements.
Mr Tony Newton, the leader of the Commons, said yesterday that where costs
to business would be significant, the government would publish compliance
cost assessments to go with the explanatory memoranda that the government
submits to parliament on EC proposals.
The move comes immediately before today's Downing Street meeting, chaired by
Mr John Major, the prime minister, at which ministers will report progress
on deregulation.
Mr Major has repeatedly emphasised that deregulating should be one of the
government's key themes. A bill to repeal outdated pieces of regulation, and
to make it easier for ministers to make further deregulatory changes in
future will be one of the main planks of the next session's legislative
programme.
At Downing Street's deregulation seminar in February, it was agreed that Mr
Major should receive progress reports every two months to ensure that the
current drive against red tape retained more momentum than its predecessors.

FT  20 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Major tested by establishment thorn
in his side - Gillian Tett says simple questions lie at the heart of Lord
Rees-Mogg's move for judicial review of the Maastricht treaty
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EVEN IF short-term politics was the motive for Lord Rees-Mogg's application
for judicial review of the Maastricht ratification, his decision to take the
political battle to the courts has revived a legal debate which has dogged
the constitution for centuries.
The questions at the heart of his application are relatively simple. How far
can the government operate independently from parliament? And in the absence
of a written constitution, who decides whether government or parliament is
more powerful?
Professor Michael Zander, a constitutional expert at the London School of
Economics, said: 'It's a major constitutional issue that has been raised. If
Lord Rees-Mogg succeeds it would put the government in very serious
difficulties.'
Lord Rees-Mogg's case is based on the argument that the bill before
parliament does not exactly match the Maastricht treaty signed by Mr John
Major last year. Lord Rees-Mogg argues that the government does not have the
right to endorse a treaty when only part of it has been approved by
parliament.
He cites two potential examples of the mismatch. The first is that the
treaty signed in Maastricht did not envisage that Britain would participate
in the social chapter. So if the Commons endorses the social chapter on
Thursday, it would endorse something Mr Major did not sign.
The second, more significant, issue is that the treaty contains protocols
relating to defence and foreign policy, which do not all appear in the bill.
The government claims the royal prerogative - the tradition which gives the
executive the right to take decisions - allows it to ratify treaties without
parliamentary approval.
Mr Leolin Price QC, Lord Rees-Mogg's barrister, who argues that this is
'perhaps the most important constitutional issue to be faced by the courts
for 300 years', says the government cannot use the royal prerogative to hand
to Europe its powers on decisions such as monetary union or foreign policy.
Legal experts were yesterday sceptical about Lord Rees-Mogg's chances of
success in the courts - even though the trend in recent constitutional
battles has been for parliament to gain powers at the expense of the
executive.
Mr Paul Craig, constitutional expert at Oxford University, said the issue of
'mismatch' between the treaty and bill was by no means clear cut -
parliament does have to approve treaties when they affect domestic British
law, but has usually approved an abridged version of such treaties.
'It's quite common for the bills to be shorter,' says Mr Craig, who cites
the original EC treaty as a crucial example of this - the full treaty had
more than 230 articles, while the 1972 bill passed by parliament was 'tiny,
only a few pages'.
Professor Trevor Hartley, an expert on EC law, says the tradition of royal
prerogative is on the government's side: 'Any British government in theory
can more or less act as it wants in foreign affairs. So it could go ahead
and ratify it without parliament - although of course that would be
politically difficult.' He adds that the problem would only arise with
'internal laws', which could, in theory, be referred to the British courts.
The government has said the opt-out on the social chapter means that British
law is not affected by the treaty. Lord Rees-Mogg argues that Britain could
still be bound by the rulings of the European courts on this matter.
For critics of the government this debate illustrates the need for a written
constitution to clarify the balance between parliament and government - or
even, some argue, to give parliament clear supremacy over the government.
Mr Craig predicts that given the constitutional significance of the case it
will go all the way to the House of Lords.

BRITISH troops will be withdrawn from the Hong Kong garrison by the time
Britain hands the colony over to China on July 1 1997, Mr Jeremy Hanley,
armed forces minister, announced last night.
But he said Army, Royal Navy and RAF units will remain until the day before

FT  20 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Profile of Lord Rees-Mogg
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LORD Rees-Mogg, Baron of Hinton Blewitt and former editor of The Times, has
always liked novelty and mischief and has argued eccentric views with
lucidity and passion, Raymond Snoddy writes.
At the same time he has been developing a deeply gloomy view of Britain
which he recently dubbed the Scarborough Syndrome after a hotel perched on a
clifftop which started to sink into the sea.
'We lose to America in football, to Brussels in European policy, to Japan in
industry, to secularism in the Church and our economic policy has been a
disaster,' Lord Rees-Mogg wrote recently in The Times.
His legal challenge to the Maastricht bill, financed at least in part by Sir
James Goldsmith, the financier, brings together all Lord Rees-Mogg's taste
for novelty and mischief, passion and gloom in a single theatrical
performance in the High Court.
He once predicted the coming of an new ice age, before global warming
diverted people's attention. He supported former US president Richard Nixon
in preference to the Washington Post over Watergate, and more recently
co-authored a book forecasting doom and disaster and the end of
civilisation.
Lord Rees-Mogg is one of the sharpest thorns in the side of Mr John Major,
who he described as a 'B-category' PM to be compared with such Tory premiers
as Chamberlain and Eden who were so weakened by crisis that they were
finally ousted.
Lord Rees-Mogg also likes heroes, however grotesque. He finds the pop singer
Madonna a more exciting role model than German chancellor Helmut Kohl. But
he admires former prime minister Margaret Thatcher much more than Madonna.
'The outstanding example of greatness in modern Britain has been Margaret
Thatcher. Her whole image is one of energy, of which as prime minister she
seemed to have almost inexhaustible reserves,' he said.
Lord Rees-Mogg's profile has been revived as a patrician columnist and
controversialist of extreme opinions.
Asked recently whether there was any area in which he felt unqualified to
make a judgment, he replied: 'Clearly there are lots of subjects on which I
am unqualified to talk about. I wouldn't write an article about
mountain-climbing.'

FT  20 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Labour study slams pay disparity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO-THIRDS of the population live in households with incomes below the
Pounds 250-a-week national average, says the first paper published by a
commission established by the Labour party to review tax and benefits.
The Commission on Social Justice, which is chaired by Sir Gordon Borrie, the
former director-general of fair trading, also found that the gap between the
highest and lowest paid in the UK is now greater than at any time since
1886.
It concluded that while many of the social evils which led to the creation
of the welfare state have been rectified, social injustice continues to dog
British society.
The basic rights of citizenship continue to be denied to some 20 per cent of
the population, according to Sir Gordon, who described the findings as 'a
wake-up call to the nation'.
'Social justice in the UK today is shocking,' he said. 'It is a national
embarrassment that 400,000 people are homeless, that over 3m are unemployed,
and that over 3m children live in poverty.'
A second paper issued by the Commission identifies four objectives for new
welfare policies:
Security - through preventing poverty rather than alleviating it.
Opportunity - helping people to achieve more for themselves.
Democracy - allowing people to make more decisions about their welfare.
Fairness - unfair inequalities should be reduced and, if possible,
eliminated.
Removing unjust inequalities is as much about wealth creation as
redistribution, it says, arguing that full employment is central to social
justice and economic efficiency.

FT  20 JUL 93 / AGIP judgment set aside by court
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Isle of Man High Court yesterday set aside a judgment obtained by AGIP
(Africa), the oil company, in the High Court in London in May 1989. The
judgment, registered by AGIP in the Isle of Man in October 1989, was to
recover Dollars 518,822 (Pounds 346,000) from Mr Barry Jackson and Mr Ian
Griffin, two Manx accountants.
Mr Jackson and Mr Griffin had petitioned on the island for the order to be
set aside.
In March 1992, AGIP assigned the judgment to Bowrings insurance company and
Deemster John Corrin, the island's senior judge, yesterday ruled the
judgment be set aside because the rights of the 1989 judgment were not now
vested in AGIP. Bowrings' said it would apply to re-register the judgment in
the island in its own name.

FT  20 JUL 93 / More institutions use voting rights
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
INSTITUTIONAL shareholders are far more likely to vote on corporate matters
than they were two years ago.
A survey by the Institutional Shareholders' Committee, an umbrella
organisation of leading shareholder groups, found that voting rights were
exercised on average by 34 per cent of the largest institutional holdings in
20 of the largest companies in Britain. The corresponding figure in 1990 was
an estimated 20 per cent.
The survey examined the 20 largest institutional shareholdings in each of
the 20 companies. Mr Julian Potter, secretary-general to the committee, said
the increased propensity to vote might reflect the growing view among
shareholders that they were the owners of the companies they invest in.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BANKS are to be asked what information they keep on customers, the office of
the data protection registrar said yesterday, Steve Thomas writes.
The move followed Labour criticism of National Westminster Bank's policy of
holding files on the political affiliations and religious opinions of
customers.
Mr Francis Aldhouse, the deputy data protection registrar, said: 'We will be
taking this issue up with all leading banks because we are not quite sure
what the situation is.' He said the holding of information about political
affiliations was 'potentially sensitive' and suggested customers were
entitled to an explanation.
The bank said it did not solicit political and religious information but
recorded data it judged helpful in building a profile of customers.
It had permission from the data protection registrar, Mr Eric Howe, to hold
such information.

FT  20 JUL 93 / Fresh charges brought over Maxwell case: Defendants accused
of frauds totalling more than Pounds 300m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SIX MEN charged over the collapse of Robert Maxwell's publishing empire
were sent for trial yesterday facing fresh charges alleging frauds totalling
more than Pounds 300m.
The new charges replace the original holding charges, which alleged a number
of offences including fraud and the theft of pension-fund assets, and
totalled some Pounds 130m.
The new charges were brought by the Serious Fraud Office against the six
defendants amid considerable secrecy late last week. They were only
disclosed at yesterday's magistrates court hearing to transfer the case to
the crown court.
In revising the indictment the SFO has made substantial changes to the
charges faced by the defendants. The original theft charges brought against
Mr Kevin Maxwell, the youngest son of the late publisher, and Mr Larry
Trachtenberg, a former adviser to Maxwell, relating to the Mirror Group
pension funds, have been replaced by one alleging conspiracy to defraud.
One new charge, brought against Mr Kevin Maxwell and his late father, also
alleges conspiracy to defraud the pension funds managed by Bishopsgate
Investment Management. The charge involves Pounds 102m and relates to the
sale of more than 5m shares in the Scitex Corporation.
Other new charges have also been made alleging conspiracies to defraud
Credit Suisse, Bayerische Vereinsbank and Mirror Group Newspapers.
Mr Kevin Maxwell now faces 10 charges of conspiracy to defraud, totalling
more than Pounds 300m. Those include alleged attempts to defraud the Mirror
Group Pension Scheme and various banks such as Credit Suisse, Swiss Bank
Corporation and Swiss Volksbank. Mr Trachtenberg faces four counts of
conspiracy to defraud involving Pounds 125m. Mr Robert Bunn, the former
finance director of Maxwell Communication Corporation, faces five charges of
conspiracy to defraud involving Pounds 120m. Mr Ian Maxwell faces three
counts of conspiracy to defraud involving Pounds 71m.
Mr Albert Fuller, a former MGN treasurer, faces two charges of conspiracy to
defraud involving Pounds 75m. Mr Michael Stoney, a former Mirror Group
Newspaper finance director, faces one charge of conspiracy to defraud MGN of
Pounds 50m and two related charges of falsifying documents.
Five of the six men appeared at City of London magistrates court yesterday
for the hearing to transfer the case to the Old Bailey - Mr Stoney is on
holiday in Florida. Conditional bail was extended for all six.
The first of the trials is not expected to begin until the middle of next
year.

   A DRIVE to co-ordinate union campaigns to preserve check-off schemes
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
under which employers debit union subscriptions from salaries - was launched
yesterday by Mr John Monks, who will be the new general secretary of the
Trades Union Congress.
The appointment of Mr Monks, now deputy general secretary of the TUC, was
confirmed yesterday. As sole candidate he was nominated by 31 unions
representing 87 per cent of total TUC membership.
Mr Monks will take over from Mr Norman Willis, who retires on September 10
at the end of this year's annual congress.
Mr Monks said one of his main concerns was to raise the morale of trade
unionists. He wanted the TUC to play a co-ordinating role in the campaign to
retain the check-off arrangements. A TUC working group on check-off has been
set up to assist unions.
unions are now legally obliged to reconfirm at least every three years that
their members wish to continue having union subscriptions debited from their
salaries. The unions, which will have to get this information from all their
members in the next 12 months, fear this could result in a fall in union
member-ships.
Mr Monks said he sensed a more positive feeling among the unions. He added
that the TUC wanted to work with good employers as well as expose bad
employers.

FT  20 JUL 93 / ITC seeks new bids for Channel 5
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Independent Television Commission yesterday tried to revive the concept
of a new national Channel 5 by calling for expressions of interest from
prospective channel operators.
The appeal comes more than six months after the ITC rejected the only
application for the franchise from a consortium put together by Thames
Television.
The ITC yesterday set out three options for a future Channel 5:
Re-advertisement of the original franchise which would cover 74 per cent of
the population with 33 transmitters. Since the rejection of the Thames bid
an ITC technical study has looked at ways of using different frequencies to
reduce the number of video recorders requiring retuning as a result of
Channel 5 interference.
It has also looked at ways of reducing the number of homes that would need
an additional aerial to receive the channel. The ITC believes such measures
would not make enough difference to justify changing the technical plan.
Using the available frequencies to create local city-based television
stations. Unless such stations were part of a national network, new
legislation would be required. The ITC has said it would like to see
evidence on the commercial viabil-ity of such an approach. Using the
frequencies as part of a plan to introduce digital television. The ITC
recently published a discussion document on digital - as opposed to the
present analogue - television. It argued that new digital channels could be
introduced alongside the simultaneous transmission of existing PAL services
on BBC, ITV and Channel 4 until early in the next century.
Mr David Glencross, chief executive of the ITC, said it was neutral on the
three options. Expressions of interest have to be presented by October 15.
A number of media organisations, including it is believed Times Warner, the
world's largest media group, are understood to be still interested in
running Channel 5 as a conventional national channel.
Thames Television also remains interested in the project but its role would
likely be a lesser one than at first proposed. The independent production
company has since been bought by Pearson, the publishing and banking group
which owns the Financial Times, and would be caught by rules limiting
cross-media ownership.
Mr Chris Rowley, involved in last year's Channel 5 bid, said yesterday he
was pleased that there now seemed to be greater interest in Channel 5.

FT  20 JUL 93 / Licence granted for waste plant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RECHEM International, the waste management group, yesterday received a
licence to keep operating its plant at Pontypool, Gwent, under new
environmental regulations, but was told to improve monitoring of toxic
emissions.
The Pollution Inspectorate gave the plant, including a proposed new
incinerator, authorisation under the Integrated Pollution Control provisions
of the 1990 Environmental Protection Act, which are coming into force in
stages.
But following a recent Welsh Office report on levels of toxic PCB and dioxin
chemicals around the plant, Rechem has been told to make 'wide- ranging'
improvements, mainly in the next six months. These include more analysis of
emissions from the stacks, environmental monitoring near the plant, and an
assessment of on-site levels of PCBs and dioxins in the air and soil.

FT  20 JUL 93 / Bull market for adaptable economists: Treasury and Bank of
England staff are in demand as City groups change the role of the
forecaster. Peter Marsh examines the job description that goes with a
lucrative contract
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF YOU are a numerate teamworker and can bluff your way out of a tight
corner, you could do worse than try your luck as a City economist.
In spite of the recession and squeeze on employment in financial services
generally, international financial groups are stepping up efforts to recruit
such people, in an effort to link their financial research more closely to
trading of currencies and securities.
Mr Avinash Persaud, a currency economist who has just moved from UBS to JP
Morgan, said: 'A few years ago City economists hardly ever met traders. Now
the view is that economics research is only useful if it helps the bottom
line.'
The moves have sparked lucrative contracts for headhunters and a flurry of
job changes among top economists in an increasingly tight market.
There has also been a steady flow of bright young economists from the Bank
of England and the Treasury to the City.
According to one firm of headhunters, in the past year recruitment companies
have conducted 10 to 20 searches for senior economists in London, up from
about six two years ago.
Among those taking on more economists are JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley and
Merrill Lynch of the US, Yamaichi and IBJ of Japan, and Swiss Bank
Corporation.
Those most in demand will have expertise in exchange-rate turbulence and
large issues of government bonds from debt-laden industrialised countries,
which have added to uncertainties in financial markets.
An estimated 400 economists work in financial research in the City - more
than ever before. Exact figures are difficult to come by because many people
may have other titles, such as markets strategist.
UBS, with 32 economists in London, is thought to employ more than any other
City group.
Although 12-hour days are common, the rewards are high. Roughly 35 of the
top City economists are thought to earn more than Pounds 100,000 a year
including bonuses, with a handful pulling in more than Pounds 200,000.
A good economist aged about 35 can expect Pounds 50,000 to Pounds 60,000.
Salaries have risen gradually in recent years.
Economists with stockbrokers and investment banks work increasingly in teams
with traders. They are frequently called on to talk to clients such as
pension funds. Rather than worry about how bonds or currencies will behave
long-term, the accent is on supporting trading operations.
Mr Roger Nightingale, a stockbroking economist for 25 years who runs his own
financial-research consultancy, said that in view of this trend virtually
all City economists should be considered as part of their employers' sales
staff. He added: 'City economists are like pop stars: they are out to sell
records, not be the best economists who ever lived.'
Views differ as to how much forecasting accuracy matters. One top City
economist, speaking anonymously, said: 'Being an economist is unlike many
other professions. As long as you can can come up with a plausible argument
for the next pattern of events, being wrong has rarely been all that
important.'
However, in the tougher competitive environment in the City, traders and
fund managers appear to be taking more notice of economists' errors  - at
least the big ones. Mr Paul Temperton, formerly a top UK economist at
Merrill Lynch, was ousted recently, partly because he argued incorrectly
last year that Britain would stay in the European exchange rate mechanism.
Another City economist who was also wrong about Britain's ERM membership
said: 'Last year was a killer for economists. The abrupt change of policy in
Britain left a lot of us exposed. If you make mistakes and don't rectify
them, clients and traders can make your life very difficult.'
The high demand for young economists with experience at the Treasury or the
Bank of England is partly because they are prized for their understanding of
government policy. Also, they are considered young enough to switch to the
different working methods of the City. Their salaries can easily double, to
about Pounds 50,000.
Mr Julian Jessop, a former Treasury economist in his late 20s, received
'half a dozen' serious approaches before deciding to leave Whitehall a year
ago for a job at Midland Global Markets.
Mr Darren Winder, aged 28, who joined SG Warburg Securities in May after
five years at the Bank of England, said the higher salary was only one
factor influencing his move.
After his spell at the Bank, where most officials are forbidden to talk to
the outside world, he wanted to work in a less restrictive environment with
more opportunity to broadcast ideas.
He said: 'There's probably more chance of Kenneth Clarke reading my views
now compared with when I was at the Bank.'

FT  20 JUL 93 / MoD 'overruled on arms exports'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOREIGN Office officials were in favour of the government circumventing its
guidelines on exports to Iraq and Iran if it was felt to be in the 'national
interest', the Scott arms-for-Iraq inquiry heard yester-day.
Under guidelines officially in place from 1985 to late 1988, the government
was supposed not to approve exports that would 'significantly enhance the
capability of either side to prolong or exacerbate' the Gulf conflict.
But giving evidence to the inquiry, Sir David Miers, a former Foreign Office
minister, said that between 1986 and 1988 he and other officials agreed to
override military criteria when considering certain exports if it was felt
that British economic and diplomatic objectives could be better served by
their approval.
Among the factors taken into account were the views of the US and of Saudi
Arabia, as well as the potential loss of market opportunities for British
companies at a time when France was increasing its commercial presence in
the Middle East.
Documents made available to the inquiry confirm that as a result defence
equipment which some experts at the Ministry of Defence considered should
have been embargoed was exported to both Iran and Iraq. This was before
ministers at the Foreign Office, the Department of Trade and Industry, and
the MoD agreed to adopt a more flexible policy on arms in a secret policy
change at the end of 1988.
Yesterday Sir David rejected a suggestion by Lord Justice Scott that
officials had adopted a 'cynical approach' both in the way they failed to
apply the guidelines and in the bland information about government policy
that was offered to parliament.
Sir David said: 'Our approach was extremely conscientious . . . each case
was looked at very carefully and it was felt that one should be very
cautious about what should be appoved.'
Sir David is now the UK ambassador to the Netherlands. He will give further
evidence today.

BRITISH RAIL yesterday announced that it was inviting bids for Meldon
Quarry, one of the last of its non-core businesses.
The quarry, on a goods-only branch line near Okehampton in Devon, supplies
the stone used as ballast underneath BR's railway tracks. It has also
started supplying aggregates to the general construction market. The quarry
employs 25 people and had a turnover of Pounds 3m in the year to March.
BR hopes to sell the quarry by the end of October. It said prospective
buyers should submit bids to Lazard Brothers, its merchant bank advisers, by
September 8.

FT  20 JUL 93 / World Trade News: GE wins Dollars 1.2bn Japanese power
contract
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GENERAL ELECTRIC, the world's largest power generating equipment producer,
last night clinched one of its biggest orders by signing a Dollars 1.2bn
(Pounds 800m) contract to build a power station for Tokyo Electric Power
(Tepco).
The announcement, which followed three years of negotiations between the US
company and the Japanese utility, clears the way for work to begin on the
world's largest power station, a 2,800MW combined-cycle plant in Yokohama.
GE was quick to point out the wider significance of the deal in view of
continuing concerns about the US trade deficit with Japan.
Mr Delbert Williamson, president and Asian regional executive for GE
industrial and power systems (Geips), said Tepco had played a key role
within Japan to improve trade relations with the US and to encourage
positive changes in Japan's procurement policies.
The order is a coup for GE in an industry which has often complained about
lack of access to Japanese markets. The US group has fared better than its
western rivals, however, and Tepco is its largest customer.
It said that Tepco had spent several years evaluating technology for
combined-cycle power, which uses the waste heat from gas turbines to power a
steam turbine, raising efficiency and reducing emissions.
The Yokohama plant is due to begin commercial service in the mid-1990s. It
will include eight GE single-shaft Stag 109F units, each using a 9F gas
turbine, a newly designed 'three-pressure reheat' steam turbine and a
hydrogen-cooled generator.
GE will design and build the plant, and is also the prime equipment
contractor.
The turbines and generators will be built at the group's plants in the US,
while Hitachi and Toshiba, the US company's Japanese associates, will supply
much of the remaining equipment.
Yesterday's announcement came a few days after Mr Williamson was appointed
to his new post; Geips reshuffled top management to 'sharpen its focus' on
the three key markets of Asia, Europe and the Americas.
He will be based in Hong Kong, where Geips is setting up a regional
headquarters.

FT  20 JUL 93 / World Trade News: Officials thrash out Nafta side deals
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
CANADIAN, US and Mexican negotiators are meeting in Ottawa this week in the
hope of resolving most outstanding issues for the environmental and labour
pacts which will form part of the North American free trade agreement.
The talks were described by one official yesterday as 'very important'. If
successful, the three countries' trade ministers are expected to meet in the
US next week to conclude the side-agreements.
The Clinton administration is aiming to submit Nafta and the parallel
agreements to Congress for ratification before the summer recess on August
6.
Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, said last week the administration
would not send Nafta to Congress for approval without the side-pacts. Nafta
is scheduled to come into force on January 1 1994, but faces an uphill
passage against special-interest groups in Congress.
The key issue in the current negotiations is how environmental and labour
standards will be enforced and how infractions will be penalised.
The US has been pushing for a strong enforcement mechanism which would
include sanctions against offenders, including the possibility of trade
penalties.
Canada and Mexico have taken a more cautious line however, insisting that
sanctions should be a domestic matter. They are concerned that complaints
about environmental or labour practices could be used as an excuse by US
companies to launch protectionist trade actions.
Substantial progress is understood to have been made in recent weeks on
narrowing differences between the three governments, including the powers of
a proposed North American environmental commission.
This week's talks are at a technical working-group level. The three
countries' chief negotiators are expected to report on progress at a press
briefing on Friday.

FT  20 JUL 93 / World Trade News: Tough Gatt message on concessions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Peter Sutherland, director-general of the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade, is in Washington this week delivering a tough message on the need
for concessions to win a Uruguay Round deal.
Not even the US could unilaterally impose its will on others, he warned.
He placed the blame for the slow world trade negotiations squarely on the
industrialised countries, which 'have not been delivering on crucial areas'
where the poor countries can compete, while the developing world has been
taking more liberal positions.
Just as bluntly Mr Sutherland said the governments of the developing
countries must be prepared to open their textile and clothing markets to
gain access for their textiles and apparel in wealthy industrialised
countries.
On his first trip to the US since taking the helm of Gatt, Mr Sutherland is
telling administration, congressional and business leaders that December 15
is the 'immutable' deadline and that he is prepared to act 'the honest
broker' to get necessary concessions.
He stressed that the US had to get support from other nations if it wanted
to rewrite the current negotiating text.
'If there are changes sought, it's for the country to determine that there's
substantive support for them,' he said. 'Any conclusion in this Round
requires everybody to take into account that they're not the only people in
the world.'
He saw no reason for US fears about losing its sovereignty to the proposed
Multilateral Trade Organisation.
Negotiators in Geneva are trying to 'flesh out' the agreement reached by the
industrialised countries at the Tokyo economic summit. During August the
parties will be asked to obtain instructions from their governments and at
the end of the month there will be a work programme to 'map out milestones
which will give us various levels of agreements that have to be reached by
particular dates'.

FT  20 JUL 93 / Clinton at last fires FBI chief
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton yesterday dismissed Mr William Sessions as director
of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, finally despairing of persuading the
embattled former judge to resign grace-fully.
'We cannot have a leadership vacuum at an agency as important to the United
States as the FBI,' Mr Clinton said at a news conference yesterday after a
meeting with Ms Janet Reno, the attorney general, at which he had decided to
fire Mr Sessions.
Mr Clinton said he would name a new director today. In the meantime he had
asked Mr Floyd Clarke, the FBI's deputy director and Mr Sessions' principal
foe within the agency, to serve as acting director.
Mr Louis Freeh, a former FBI agent and federal prosecutor who is currently a
judge in New York, is expected to be nominated for the FBI directorship.
Mr Sessions has served little more than half of his statutory 10-year term
at the head of the principal US federal police force; his ability to lead
the FBI has been considerably impaired since a January report by the Justice
Department accused him of ethical violations, including the misuse of FBI
cars, aircraft and employees for personal ends.
Mrs Alice Sessions complained on Sunday that her husband was the victim of a
campaign by a group of old FBI hands who objected to his efforts to bring
some racial and gender diversity to the largely white, male agency.
Mr Clinton acknowledged yesterday that Mr Sessions had performed a
considerable service in broadening the look of the FBI but said that he
agreed fully with Ms Reno's judgment that he was no longer capable of
leading the FBI. He said one of the reasons he had taken so long before
dismissing him was his belief that the FBI should not be politicised and
that a change of president should not be sufficient reason for changing the
director.

FT  20 JUL 93 / GM to settle suit over pick-up trucks
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
GENERAL MOTORS has agreed to settle dozens of lawsuits by giving the owners
of some 4.7m pick-up trucks with side-mounted petrol tanks Dollars 1,000 in
coupons towards the purchase of a new GM vehicle, agencies report from
Detroit.
In two separate agreements, filed in a state court in Texas and in a federal
court in Philadelphia, GM said it settled all the outstanding class action
lawsuits filed by owners of its 1973-1987 pick-ups.
The owners were seeking to be reimbursed for resale value they said they
lost because the trucks are allegedly vulnerable to fiery explosions in
side-on collisions.
In April the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration asked GM to
recall the pick-ups, based on a finding that the trucks were 2.4 times more
likely to catch fire in fatal side-on collisions than similar trucks built
by Ford. But GM claims the pick-ups are safe and reiterated yesterday that
it did not intend to recall the trucks.
'It does not affect the NHTSA case in any way, shape or form,' a GM
spokesman said. 'This is not a recall. There is absolutely no modification
of the vehicle. This separates the customer satisfaction concerns from the
technical concerns.'
The Dollars 1,000 certificates are transferable within an immediate family
and cannot be sold without the truck.

FT  20 JUL 93 / Central St Louis holds out against record flooding
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE muddy floodwaters of the Mississippi River crested yesterday in St
Louis, breaking flood records and swamping many of the city's outskirts but
remaining five feet short of the giant floodwall protecting the central
area.
Although the worst of the floods seemed to have passed, rain continued to
drench 12 Midwestern states on Sunday, and thunderstorms hit parts of
Kansas, Minnesota, Ohio and Illinois yesterday.
A quirk in the jetstream that usually drives weather systems from west to
east across the continental US continues to block a cold front over the
Midwest; there it meets a mass of hot and humid air from the south and east,
producing rainfall that has remained above average for eight months.
With the Mississippi, the Missouri and their swollen tributaries likely to
remain flooded for weeks, the chances that more dams, earthworks and levees
will give way are high.
After submitting a Dollars 2.48bn (Pounds 1.65bn) aid bill to Congress last
week, the Clinton administration has all but given up trying to put a cost
on the damage until the rivers stabilise. Some informal estimates of the
total property damage run as high as Dollars 15bn, although federal
officials have warned that the victims should not expect the government to
bail them out entirely.
'We have to caution the victims that these programmes are designed to try to
get people back on their feet. There is no way that any federal programme is
going to restore them to 100 per cent,' said Mr Leon Panetta, President Bill
Clinton's budget director.
Seven states have so far been declared federal disaster areas, but parts of
another two states are expected to be designated soon for emergency aid.
Members of Congress, however, are alarmed at demands from less-affected
areas for federal money, as well as the claims of some eastern states that
their heatwave qualifies them for drought assistance. 'If we turn this thing
into a trough event, we're going to make deficit reduction impossible,' said
Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska.

FT  20 JUL 93 / US compromise on gays set to draw fire: Clinton backs away
from campaign pledge to end ban on homosexuals in military
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton yesterday at last announced his policy on gays
serving in the armed forces, 'an honourable compromise' that falls far short
of his campaign promise to end the ban on homosexuality in the armed
services but which seeks to end military witchhunts against gays.
Mr Clinton told an audience of senior officers that the new policy would
judge servicemen and women on their conduct rather than their sexual
orientation, and would continue the practice he instituted at the beginning
of his presidency of not asking recruits if they were homosexual.
Anyone openly declaring themselves to be gay would create a 'rebuttable
presumption' of an intention to breach military conduct rules; these conduct
rules would be enforced uniformly against heterosexuals and homosexuals,
'with decent regard to the privacy and associational rights of all members'.
'It is not a perfect solution. It is not identical with some of my own
goals, and will clearly not please everyone, perhaps not anyone,' Mr Clinton
said.
A senior administration official described the new policy, which has won the
grudging acquiescence of the joint chiefs of staff, as 'don't ask, don't
tell, don't pursue'. They said any attempt to lift the ban on homosexuals in
the forces outright would have been overridden by Congress.
'I think that any reasonable reading of where the Congress is at this point
would lead you to think that it would be almost impossible to sustain a
complete lifting of the ban,' a senior administration official said.
'In all honesty, I must say that I do not think the proposal I would like
him to put forward would be sustained,' agreed Mr Barney Frank, one of
Congress's two openly gay members, adding that he believed Mr Clinton had
been 'very courageous' in taking on the issue.
But even the limited measures proposed yesterday may be too much for Senator
Sam Nunn, chairman of the Senate armed services committee, who carries
considerable clout in the Senate both because of his expertise on military
questions and because of his leadership of a bloc of southern conservatives.
Mr Nunn, who was largely responsible for derailing Mr Clinton's efforts to
dispose of the issue quickly at the start of his presidency, is expected to
seek today to write some of the existing prohibitions against homosexuality
into law as a rider to this year's defence authorisation bill.
Besides a protracted battle in Congress, gay advocacy groups are now
expected to press a number of lawsuits contesting the military ban.

FT  20 JUL 93 / World Trade News: Global agreements 'will hit food supply' -
Report sees big companies roaming the world in hunt for cheap produce
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PRESS ASSOCIATION
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ATTEMPTS to reach global agreement on trade and tariffs will not make the
world's food supply more secure and are likely to jeopardise the
environment, according to a review of world trade published today, Press
Association reports.
Accords such as the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) and
regional food regimes like the European Community's agricultural policy are
pushing the food trade in the wrong direction, it says.
Food should be produced as close to where it will be consumed as possible,
argues Mr Tim Lang, director of Parents for Safe Food, and Mr Colin Hines,
co-ordinator of Greenpeace International's economics unit.
In the review - The New Protectionism - they say global agreements simply
promote a trend in the food trade for increasingly powerful companies and
countries to roam the world looking for cheaper food supplies.
'This may benefit some consumers in the short term, but the world loses in
the long term. Long-distance food should be the last resort, not the first.'
Increased world trade, rather than local trade, means food routinely
travelling the globe, when this should only happen in emergencies. Intensive
production methods push out small producers, to the detriment of the
environment.
Starvation and plenty exist side by side, with Kenyan green beans flown by
supermarkets to lighten British winter dinner tables, when there is
starvation in nearby Mozambique.
Orange juice is shipped from citrus plantations in Latin America when Greek
oranges are being dumped.
Consumers should be encouraged to eat more seasonal and locally grown foods
where possible, the report adds.

<TEXT>
MS Kim Campbell, Canada's new prime minister, has begun to put her stamp on
the nine-year-old Conservative government's policies by clamping down on
foreign magazines which seek tax benefits through printing low-cost Canadian
editions.
The new magazine policy, announced yesterday, is a rare reversal of the
liberalisation of foreign-investment rules which has marked the Tories'
rule.
It follows an outcry among domestic periodical publishers over a
recently-launched Canadian edition of Sports Illustrated, the US-owned
magazine. By commissioning a small number of Canadian stories and using a
Toronto printing plant, Sports Illustrated has been able to offer
advertisers the same tax-deductible benefits available to advertisers in
domestic magazines.
Mr Jean Charest, industry minister, said the government would revise its
foreign-investment rules to require the publisher of a 'split-run' edition
to obtain the approval of Investment Canada, the agency which screens new
foreign businesses.
Foreign investment in 'cultural' industries, such as broadcasting and
publishing, has long been politically sensitive. Sports Illustrated has
circumvented rules by transmitting most of the magazine electronically to
Toronto.

FT  20 JUL 93 / World Trade News: Asians seek a head for their bloc -
Attempts to find a forum for co-operation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALEXANDER NICOLL and WILLIAM KEELING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ASIAN countries, aware that growing economic power carries with it political
responsibilities, agree on the need for greater co-operation. There are
divisions, however, over the form it should take and, in particular, the
role the US should play within Asia.
Two meetings, the first later this month in Singapore and another in Seattle
in November, will push forward attempts to forge a more multilateral
approach to regional security and economic issues. But western experts are
doubtful that they will produce much more than talk.
In Singapore foreign ministers from the Association of South East Asian
Nations - which represents Brunei, Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore
and the Philippines - will meet counterparts from the US, Canada, Japan,
South Korea, Australia, New Zealand and the European Community. Other
countries, including Russia, Vietnam and Laos, have also been invited in the
most broad-based regional discussions yet.
The meeting will look at how regional disputes can be kept in check with the
end of the cold war and a scaling down of US troops in Asia. The North
Korean nuclear threat, the future of Taiwan, and disputed territory in the
South China Sea all pose significant security risks for the future.
But as Mr Gerald Segal, senior fellow at the International Institute for
Strategic Studies in London, points out: 'At a time when there are real
security issues on the agenda, is it enough to be just discussing them?' He
says nothing of substance has been done to solve the dispute over the
Spratly Islands, claimed by China and several other countries, because
nobody wants to upset Beijing.
A series of confidence-building measures should be undertaken, such as a
regional listing of arms sales, to improve transparency in relations, Mr
Segal says.
A similar lack of progress has characterised discussion of regional trade
issues. Asean is the region's most active trade grouping but the US is
pushing for the 15-member Asian-Pacific Economic Co-operation (Apec) forum
to be given a more prominent role.
The US and Japan are members of Apec, which groups together most south and
east Asian countries - including the 'three Chinas' (China, Taiwan and Hong
Kong) - along with Australia and New Zealand.
Malaysia, however, with the support of some Asian countries, is proposing an
alternative, more restrictive, East Asian Economic Caucus (EAEC), which
would exclude the US, Australia and New Zealand.
Mr Gareth Evans, foreign minister of Australia, which was the driving force
behind Apec's creation sees its future as a powerful vehicle for regional
trade liberalisation to be built on the principle of 'open regionalism -
that is, not aimed at putting up barriers to the rest of the world'.
Apec is 'starting to lock in much more specifically and in a much more
switched-on way to the absolutely mainstream economic debate about the
future of the region,' Mr Evans said in an interview.
The US, which does more trade with Asian countries than with Europe, is keen
to play an active role in the region's trade issues. Hence, President
Clinton's call for an 'informal leadership conference' of Apec in Seattle to
map out a grand vision of future co-operation.
The US government's enthusiasm, however, is not shared by some Asian
countries and Apec is a long way from establishing any trade agreements.
Washington will have its diplomatic hands full to persuade leaders from
China, Taiwan and Hong Kong simultaneously to attend the summit. Mr Mahathir
Mohamad, the Malaysian prime minister, has already said he will not attend.
Malaysian officials believe Apec could become a western-dominated trade bloc
and Mr Abdullah Badawi, the Malaysian foreign minister, said last weekend he
would ask other Asean leaders to refuse Mr Clinton's invitation.
The US may struggle to win over Asian governments which are sceptical of
Washington's commitment to free trade. Rather, many Asian diplomats believe
the US sees Apec as a means of preventing a purely Asian trading bloc, such
as Mr Mahathir's EAEC proposal, emerging.
Mr Peter Ferdinand, who heads the Asia programme at the Royal Institute of
International Affairs in London, says Apec is weakened by the US which,
while apparently promoting it, adopts a confrontational approach to Japan on
market access and attaches human rights conditions to its trade relations
with China.
The short-term outcome is likely to be a compromise which leads to a
confusing proliferation of acronyms and suits none of the parties. Indonesia
takes over from the US as Apec chairman in November and will probably
support EAEC's creation. Jakarta will argue, however, for EAEC to fall under
the umbrella of Apec, rather than be an extension of Asean, which Kuala
Lumpur would prefer.
How hard any of the parties will push depends in large measure on the
outcome of negotiations on the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. If
the Gatt talks fail, Asian attempts to strike trade agreements will take on
a new significance.

FT  20 JUL 93 / Easy ride expected for Ginsburg
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE US Senate judiciary committee today begins a week of hearings on the
nomination of Judge Ruth Bader Ginsburg to the Supreme Court. But the scene
will be very different from the last such confirmation, when millions of
television viewers deserted the soap operas for C-Span's engrossing drama of
Ms Anita Hill's charges of sexual harassment by nominee Mr Clarence Thomas.
Mr Thomas won confirmation and has just completed his second term on the
Supreme Court. But both his supporters and his opponents vowed that the
lamentable spectacle of his confirmation hearings should not be repeated.
For Mrs Ginsburg, at least, that vow is expected to hold: she is expected to
win easy and calm confirmation.
During the last 12 years of Republican presidents, abortion became the major
issue in Supreme Court hearings, with mostly pro-choice Democrats in the
Senate majority seeking to undo the pro-life candidates put forward by Mr
Ronald Reagan and Mr George Bush.
This time, it is barely controversial. Even anti-abortion groups that
dislike Mrs Ginsburg's recorded views on the issue have concluded that
opposing her would be a waste of their resources.
Future candidates can also count on a more discreet airing of personal
allegations. Senator Joe Biden, judiciary committee chairman, was much
criticised for his handling of Ms Hill's charges against Mr Thomas and has
instituted a closed session to round off this week's public hearings.
Most of the Clinton administration's confirmation wounds have been
self-inflicted. But right-wing opposition groups succeeded in derailing the
nomination of Ms Lani Guinier to a Justice Department position and have
managed at least to delay hearings on Dr Joycelyn Elders, nominated to be
surgeon general, and on Dr Tara O'Toole, picked for a post at the Energy
Department.

FT  20 JUL 93 / Belize suspends territorial pact with Guatemala
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CANUTE JAMES

<DATELINE>
   KINGSTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BELIZE'S new government is to suspend legislation approving an agreement
between the previous administration and neighbouring Guatemala to settle a
130-year-old territorial dispute. Belize has also asked the Guatemalan
government for a review of the pact.
Mr Manuel Esquivel, prime minister of the former British colony, said the
aim was to get Guatemala to renounce all claims on Belizean territory. Mr
Esquivel took office a fortnight ago after a narrow general election
victory.
The pact ending the dispute was reached by Mr George Price, Mr Esquivel's
predecessor, and Mr Jorge Serrano, former president of Guatemala.
'Too many concessions were made by the previous government in order to reach
a speedy conclusion of the matter. We will not allow this to happen,' Mr
Esquivel said.
'Our concern, basically, is that Belize has given up rights it has under
Belizean law. We say that it is not for the government alone to make this
decision. Ultimately, it will have to be by a referendum.'
At the heart of the settlement between Mr Price and Mr Serrano are changes
to Belize's maritime boundaries to satisfy Guatemalan desires for access to
the Caribbean Sea. The changes allow Guatemalan ships use of a navigation
channel in the Gulf of Honduras, bordered by Belize, Guatemala and Honduras.
The agreement was ratified by Belizean legislators and Guatemala's
constitutional court.
Repeated indications over the past two decades that the Guatemalan military
might invade Belize in pursuit of the territorial claim led to the
stationing of a 1,500-member British garrison in Belize. Two months ago the
UK said it intended to withdraw the garrison. During the election campaign
Mr Esquivel claimed that Mr Price's administration had no plans for the
defence of the country.
Guatemalan conservatives and sections of the military have objected to any
agreement which does not satisfy Belizean territorial claims.

<TEXT>
FRANCE yesterday called for a special meeting of EC foreign and farm
ministers in September to discuss re-opening the Blair House accord on
agriculture reached last year between the US and EC.
The call reaffirms France's determination to renegotiate Blair House, but it
remains uncertain whether the majority of EC member states are ready to back
a move which could torpedo efforts to strike a Uruguay Round deal by the end
of the year.
Belgium, which holds the rotating European Community presidency, noted
France's request at a meeting of EC foreign ministers in Brussels yesterday.
EC officials predicted that the 'jumbo' council of farm and foreign
ministers would probably take place, if only to allow the French to 'let off
steam'.
Mr Alain Lamassoure, French foreign minister responsible for European
affairs, said France's attitude to the recent Uruguay Round talks in Tokyo
between the US, Canada, the EC and Japan had been constructive. Now that
'decisive' progress had been made on market access for industrial products,
it was time to re-open talks on agriculture.

BRITISH defence companies will be making a renewed pitch for contracts
during today's visit to Turkey of Mr Richard Needham, the UK trade minister.
Credit proposals for Turkey's Dollars 400m (Pounds 266.6m) mine hunter
vessel contract have to be submitted today. Vosper Thornycroft, of
Southampton, is competing to win the largest defence contract tendered by
the Turkish armed forces this year.
The contract for six mine hunters is an integrated bid. Vosper's proposal
includes Marconi's 2093 sonar and its Nautis command and control system.
Also bidding are Direction des Constructions Navales of France, Germany's
Abeking &amp; Rasmussen and Luerssen Werft, and Intermarine of Italy.
Vosper's bid, with that of DCN and Intermarine, involves a glass-reinforced
plastic hull, while the Germans are offering a non-magnetic steel hull.
Vosper's Sandown type vessel is already in service with the Royal Navy.
Initial bids were submitted on July 8. However, an early decision may be
delayed following a reshuffle in SSM, the Turkish defence procurement
agency, with the dismissal last week of Defence Under-Secretary Vahit Erdem.
An earlier possibility is the contract for fire control systems for the 35mm
anti-aircraft gun. Marconi, together with Racal, is bidding to supply its
Eagle system in a contract worth an estimated Dollars 200m. The UK company
is competing against Contraves of Switzerland and a Dutch-French venture
between Thompson CSF and Holland Signal.
Also under evaluation are bids for the Dollars 1bn Turkish Armed Forces
Integrated Communications System. The UK subsidiary of Northern Telcom of
Canada is offering its Savkom system. If successful, UK companies are
expected to pick up substantial sub-contract work.

FT  20 JUL 93 / China looks to cool its red-hot economy and restrain
inflation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LYNNE O'DONNELL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BEIJING
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CHINA'S State Statistical Bureau said yesterday the economy grew in the
first half by an annual rate of 13.9 per cent, more than a full percentage
point higher than the 12.8 per cent recorded for all of 1992.
Mr Zhang Zhongji, a bureau spokesman, nevertheless remained convinced that
policies introduced in recent weeks aimed at cutting soaring inflation and
cooling the red-hot economy would keep growth down to 12 per cent for the
whole year.
'As long as every region and every department fully implements the policies
set by the central government, we will be able to overcome the problems that
crop up in the course of development,' Mr Zhang said.
The government's inability to control inflation led to the appointment
earlier this month of Mr Zhu Rongji, senior vice-premier, to the
governorship of the Bank of China, the central bank.
Inflation is now year-on-year 14 per cent nationally, and 21.6 per cent in
35 big cities.
Chinese people are not known for their tolerance of rapidly rising prices
and in 1988 were spurred by rampant inflation into a panic-buying spree that
was followed by the anti-government demonstrations eventually put down by
the army on June 4 the following year.
Since taking on the extra workload on July 2, Mr Zhu has increased interest
rates to encourage companies to repatriate hard currency and to attract bank
deposits.
He has poured tens of millions of dollars into the money market to stabilise
the yuan, and has blocked speculative loans.
Yesterday's figures show that money supply is still growing at an annual 50
per cent.
Investment in fixed assets grew at an annual rate of 61 per cent -
accounting for the construction fever that has turned cities into quagmires.
But the growth is patchy, reflecting the inordinate amount of investment
that goes to the relatively well developed coastal regions, leaving China's
centre with conditions comparable to the poverty and feudalism of the 1920s.
Mr Zhang's call for all areas of the country to follow the new
belt-tightening policies no doubt has its roots in a breakdown of the
figures his bureau released yesterday.
The southern and eastern regions - led by Guangdong province bordering Hong
Kong and Shanghai on the eastern seaboard - attracted an annualised 81.2 per
cent more investment from state-owned enterprises. This is almost 30 per
cent more than the money that went to the country's centre and west.
While retail sales grew nationally by 21.6 per cent year-on-year, two-thirds
of that can be attributed to 10 areas in the south and east.

   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US and North Korea have agreed on speedy resumption of talks between
Pyongyang and the International Atomic Energy Agency designed to pave the
way for international inspections of two suspect North Korean nuclear sites.
But the US failed to secure a pledge that North Korea would allow IAEA
inspections of the sites, at the Yongbyon nuclear complex. Mr Robert
Gallucci, assistant US secretary of state, admitted there was 'more work to
do' but said yesterday's agreement was a 'step in the right direction.'
The agreement came at a second round of bilateral discussions in Geneva. A
third round of talks is planned within the next two months.
North Korea will continue to suspend its decision in March to withdraw from
the 1968 Nuclear Non-Proliferation treaty, which forbids non-nuclear states
from acquiring nuclear weapons and requires IAEA inspections to guard
against diversion of nuclear materials for weapons use.
In an agreed statement, the two sides said North Korea was 'prepared to
begin consultations with the IAEA on outstanding safeguards and other issues
as soon as possible.' Mr Kang Sok Chu, North Korea's first deputy foreign
minister, said these consultations would include Pyongyang's insistence on
IAEA impartiality. North Korea has cited IAEA bias as grounds for refusing
access to the two buildings where the agency believes plutonium may be
stored.
The statement reaffirms in general terms US pledges not to use force against
a peaceful North Korea, but Pyongyang did not secure the assurance it
apparently wanted that next year's joint US/South Korean 'Team Spirit'
military exercises would be dropped.
The statement also calls for talks between North and South Korea as soon as
possible on the nuclear and other bilateral issues. Mr Kang said North Korea
was proposing a high-level meeting to pave the way for a summit.
In a surprise development, the US has agreed in principle to help North
Korea convert its nuclear power stations from graphite moderated reactors to
light-water moderated reactors. Mr Gallucci said this was conditional on
North Korea being 'in full compliance with the NPT regime,' including
inspections.
Mr Gallucci said light water reactors were more 'proliferation-resistant'
than 'provocative' graphite moderated reactors, because they required
importation of enriched uranium and thus made countries dependent on the
political goodwill of suppliers.

Mr Ekeus, head of the UN special commission on Iraq's weapons of mass
destruction, said he had reached a 'satisfactory' interim solution to
monitoring the missile sites - lifting the threat of a UN-backed military
strike against the two complexes. 'I don't see any crisis after these
talks,' he said after a two-hour meeting with Mr Tariq Aziz, Iraq's deputy
prime minister.
Mr Ekeus said his discussions with Iraqi officials over the past five days
had broken the 'vicious circle' of UN inspections and Iraqi obstruction
which has provoked a string of tense confrontations since the Gulf war.
He also said that the resulting improvement in relations between the UN and
Iraq could ease agreement in separate negotiations on a limited exemption to
the embargo on Iraqi oil sales. The talks were suspended last week in New
York as Iraqi officials returned to Baghdad with a draft agreement for the
prospective Dollars 1.6bn (Pounds 1.06bn) oil sale, with diplomats in New
York saying an accord appeared close.
Mr Ekeus gave no details of the compromise reached on the monitoring of the
two missile test sites, but said he was confident it would be approved by
the UN Security Council, to which he will report on his return to New York.
His mission to Baghdad was prompted by Iraq's refusal to allow UN inspectors
to install video cameras at the sites or to seal monitoring equipment there
 -part of long-term monitoring of Iraq's weapons programmes mandated under
UN resolution 715. Washington had warned of possible military action if Iraq
refused to comply with UN inspectors.
But potentially more significant is Iraq's apparent concession over
long-term monitoring of conventional, chemical, biological and nuclear
weapons programmes banned by Gulf war ceasefire resolutions. 'Iraq has
stated that they are ready to comply with plans for future monitoring and
verification adopted under resolution 715,' Mr Ekeus said.
Iraq has fiercely resisted UN resolution 715 and said it would allow
long-term monitoring only after the UN had lifted its economic embargo. But
Mr Ekeus said Iraq 'no longer insists' on a prior lifting of the embargo.
He said that Iraq had presented a position paper on long-term monitoring
which contained 'positive elements' which would be discussed in 'high-level
technical talks' likely to convene in New York in August or September.
However, he added that there remained 'a large number of outstanding
issues'.
UN diplomats in New York expressed caution over Iraq's apparent acceptance
of resolution 715, but said that if Iraq was serious it could be a
'curtain-raiser' to the easing of sanctions. 'Agreement in itself won't
trigger a lifting of the embargo, they will have to implement that
agreement,' said one.
Moreover, compliance with 715 is only one of a series of conditions Iraq
would have to meet to fulfil all the Gulf war ceasefire resolutions. The
British, US and French UN ambassadors yesterday presented a list of
outstanding areas of non-compliance to the Security Council.
These included Iraq's failure to accept the new boundary with Kuwait,
failure to disclose an exhaustive list of its weapons suppliers, a lack of
information about Kuwaiti detainees and continued human rights abuses.

FT  20 JUL 93 / Seoul may intervene in Hyundai labour dispute
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   SEOUL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE South Korean government said it would intervene directly in the labour
dispute at Hyundai, the country's biggest conglomerate, unless a settlement
is reached today, writes John Burton in Seoul.
The 45 days of industrial action, mostly consisting of partial walkouts, at
10 Hyundai companies, including its main motor vehicle and shipbuilding
units, have resulted in production losses of Dollars 1.4bn (Pounds 930m) and
threaten the government's economic recovery programme.
The government could invoke emergency powers and ban any job actions for 20
days, including possibly suppression of any illegal strike activity, as it
mediates in the dispute.
However, there are indications that tensions are easing at Hyundai. Workers
at eight of the nine companies still engaged in industrial action resumed
normal production late last week in a goodwill gesture to win concessions.
But they threatened to stage a second one-day general strike later this
week, following one on July 7, if no progress is made in labour
negotiations.
The government threat of intervention is seen as an attempt to force labour
and management to compromise quickly and prevent another general strike.
The Hyundai trade unions are seeking pay rises above the 4.7 per cent
offered by management, the right to partial pay during strike periods, union
shops and a 40-hour week.

FT  20 JUL 93 / 'Beware the paper in Vietnam tiger': Bureaucracy, a sketchy
legal system and ramshackle infrastructure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM BARNES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SIREN call of Vietnam's much touted economic takeoff could lure many
foreign investors into costly mistakes, according to financial advisers who
have studied the country's business environment.
The hoo-ha over a tough, canny people hungry to emulate and even outstrip
other Asian 'miracle' economies overlooks the stifling bureaucracy, sketchy
legal system, ramshackle infrastructure and a dearth of domestic funds.
Mr Chris Bruton, of Bangkok-based Dataconsult, said: 'People are not going
to hang back - they are going to jump like a lot of sheep over a fence into
the river and some of them will get drowned.' Excitement about Vietnam was
mounting well before President Bill Clinton said earlier this month he was
lifting US objections to renewed lending by multilateral agencies.
This allows the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank to start funding
the construction of roads, power stations, telecommunications networks and
the like.
Infrastructure development might be a prerequisite for speedy growth but few
experienced observers have been tempted - as the Vietnamese sometimes have -
to view big-project lending as a panacea for the country's economic ills.
Mr Hien Tran Trung of Ernst and Young, the first leading accounting firm to
set up in the country, said: 'The country has seen its social, physical and
intellectual infrastructures destroyed (by decades of war and political
campaign). Yet after effectively opening its doors only three years ago it
has inflation under control, a stable currency and has attracted Dollars
5.4bn in investments. That must be encouraging.'
However, Mr Ray Eaton, chairman of the Export Development Trading
Corporation which has several medium-sized investment's in the country,
said: 'Expectations are far too high all round. The Vietnamese are being
told by their own media that soon everyone will have a Mercedes-Benz and a
gold Rolex.'
Mr Bruton describes suggestions that Vietnam is at the same economic stage
as Thailand was 20 years ago as outlandish.
'I've been horrified by people gearing up to invest in Vietnam as if it was
a Tiger in the making - it's nothing like that. I was living in Thailand in
1973, and visiting Vietnam. I can tell you Vietnam now is nothing like as
far advanced as Thailand was in 1973. It's more like Thailand probably was
in 1953,' Mr Bruton said.
Vietnam has shown a remarkable capacity for recovery since the scrapping of
neo-Stalinist state planning in the late 1980s and the loss of the former
Soviet Union's financial help.
There has been an explosion of small businesses and the country has switched
from being a rice importer to the world's third largest rice exporter.
Mr Peter Brimble, the managing director of Seamico Business Information and
Research, said: 'There's something electric in the air. You have the feeling
something's going to happen in Vietnam - that there'll be a break-out; very
quick growth.'
In the supposedly crippling absence of loans from the international lending
agencies real economic growth was estimated at 8.3 per cent last year.
But Mr Bruton insists: 'In 10 years from now Vietnam will be very
interesting; 20 years from now very interesting indeed and 30 years from now
it will perhaps be like Thailand is today.'
Simple arithmetic shows that even if Vietnam achieves its ambitious 9.5 per
cent annual growth target for a decade the country will only be half as rich
as Thailand.
Foreign companies are usually advised, as far as possible, to drip-feed
money into Vietnam: a lot of trauma lies between one of the world's most
open investment laws and its practical application.
Privatisation, or 'equitisation', has hardly begun; in the meantime joint
venture partners are state-owned companies.
Tsao Chun-ya, general manager of Taiwan's Yao Teh group, a property company
that built Vietnam's first glass-walled office tower, told Taiwanese
journalists of the frustration of dealing with the ostensibly autonomous
representative of state companies: 'When they hold a meeting with you, they
take out a notebook and pencil, jot down your questions, go back to report
and give you a response the next time around.'
Attempts to circumvent red-tape in the traditional Asian fashion often come
unstuck. One Thai businessman lamented the lack of ethics among Vietnamese
officials: 'In China if you bribe someone you usually get something. In
Vietnam you're more often than not just throwing your money away.'
One western investor said that the Vietnamese had become 'progressively more
rapacious'.
'It's turning me off the country - perhaps they've been poor so long they've
lost a sense of decency.'
In the hotel bars of Saigon (Ho Chi Minh City) and Hanoi tales are told of
joint venture partners suddenly saying 'what joint venture?', of loggers
belatedly discovering their newly purchased logs are riddled with old
bullets, and of fish farms that mysteriously lose all their fish.
The difficulty of isolating key decision makers in a country which still
values consensus makes appeals to reason, and bribery for that matter,
ineffective.
Taiwan has invested more than any other country, yet Mr Huang Chei-yien, of
the China External Trade Development Council's Ho Chi Minh City office,
urged his countrymen to 'double your estimate of time and costs'.
Unesco officials admit privately that the government's much touted 95 per
cent literacy rate is functionally much lower.
Entrepreneurs are advised to put in a lot of foot slogging on the ground in
Vietnam; to tailor - as far as possible - any investment to fit the
authorities' idea of a good project, probably exporting or
import-substituting; to ensure, where appropriate, that your joint venture
partner has adequate access to supplies of raw materials; and be tough -
everything is negotiable in Vietnam.

FT  20 JUL 93 / LDP leaders'election row goes public
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LEADERS of Japan's Liberal Democratic party argued openly yesterday over who
should resign to take the blame for the party's loss of power, as opposition
parties huddled together in the hope of forming a coalition government.
Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, was under pressure to quit from
other LDP faction heads, who suggested that he make way for a leader
acceptable to a potential coalition partner and, preferably, one of their
own faction members.
But Mr Miyazawa said a decision on his future would come after 'consulting'
his party, though he will 'try again' to reform the electoral system,
indicating that he wants to remain as leader in spite of the unsubtle hints
from other senior officials.
The first day of post-election jockeying saw each of the opposition parties
staking out territory, and hinting at a coalition without making firm
commitments to partnerships with other opposition parties or with the LDP.
It is expected that an extraordinary sesssion of parliament, which must be
held within 30 days of the election, will be convened on August 2, when a
new prime minister is to be chosen. In the meantime, the LDP hopes to find a
partner to ensure that its candidate is chosen.
The most pressing questions to be resolved in the meantime are the identity
of the LDP candidate and the partner party. Mr Toshiki Kaifu, the former
prime minister, yesterday suggested that Mr Miyazawa should resign,
presumably to make way for Mr Kaifu himself.
Mr Ryutaro Hashimoto, a former finance minister, is another potential
candidate, though he is thought arrogant by fellow party members. Mr Michio
Watanabe, the foreign minister, wants to be prime minister, but he is in ill
health and is opposed to reform of the political system.
A LDP prime ministerial candidate must have pro-reform credentials to
satisfy a potential partner such as the Japan New party, which campaigned on
the need to overhaul Japanese politics and would need the resignation of Mr
Miyazawa to keep its supporters happy.
Mr Miyazawa, an accomplished performer in the company of the Group of Seven
leaders earlier this month, again finds himself repeatedly humiliated by LDP
factions. An indiscreet conversation, picked up by television microphones,
had two officials plotting the demise of Mr Miyazawa, who spent the day
denying that he had already resigned.
The poor performance of the Social Democratic party, still the largest
opposition party, but which lost almost half of its seats, prompted calls
for the resignation of its chairman, Mr Sadao Yamahana. He suggested that
the first priority is to form a coalition government, not for him to resign.
Mr Tsutomu Hata, leader of the Japan Renewal party, was also publicly
confident about opposition parties mustering the numbers to force the LDP
out of office. However, his powerbroker colleague, Mr Ichiro Ozawa, was
rumoured to be negotiating with LDP officials about a Hata-led LDP coalition
governmnent.

THE PAKISTANI opposition leader, Ms Benazir Bhutto, yesterday appealed to
the new caretaker government to stop drug money being used to buy votes in
mid-term elections set for October, Reuter reports from Islamabad.
'We don't want dirty money, drug money, smuggled money to taint the
political life of Pakistan,' she told a news conference just hours after the
country's two top leaders resigned to pave the way for fresh elections.
President Ghulam Ishaq Khan stepped down and the prime minister, Mr Nawaz
Sharif, dissolved parliament on Sunday in a deal negotiated by the army to
end a feud between them that had paralysed government for six months. The
caretaker prime minister, Mr Moeen Qureshi, a former World Bank
vice-president, met the acting president and former senate chairman, Mr
Wasim Sajjad, to discuss forming a cabinet to govern in the run-up to
elections on October 6.
Shares on the Pakistani stock exchange closed higher on a brisk trade after
the appointment of Mr Qureshi.
Ms Bhutto said she met Mr Sajjad yesterday to discuss her demands for
electoral reforms to prevent horsetrading and to ensure free and fair polls,
and requested a meeting with Mr Qureshi to raise similar issues. 'We need
confidence-building steps to develop a process not tainted with drugs
money,' Ms Bhutto said.
In 1990, Mr Qureshi visited Pakistan in his capacity as World Bank
vice-president and issued a scathing attack on the nation's economic
problems.
He voiced dismay at the prevalence of drugs, bribery and corruption.

<TEXT>
JAPAN'S money supply grew in June for the third consecutive month, in spite
of continued sluggish economic activity in the private sector.
The Bank of Japan said yesterday the 1.4 per cent year-on-year growth of M2,
plus certificates of deposit, the key money supply aggregate, reflected
continuing payments for public works.
Economists expect further steady growth of money supply to support the
economy in the coming months.
During the campaigning for Sunday's general election most parties, including
the Liberal Democratic party, tried to arouse public support by calling for
income tax cuts, suggesting that there may be more fiscal measures to
stimulate money supply growth after a new government is formed.
The Bank of Japan said the June increase in money supply was marginally
lower than May's 1.5 per cent, as funds were shifted to investment
instruments not included in the key aggregate.
M1 grew by 2.9 per cent last month, while M3, or broad liquidity, grew by
3.1 per cent, slightly higher than May's 2.9 per cent.

FT  20 JUL 93 / Community to relax voting rules
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EC FOREIGN ministers yesterday agreed to draw up rules to allow foreign EC
nationals to vote in next June's European Parliament elections in the
country where they live.
The flexible voting system would comply with the Maastricht treaty's concept
of European citizenship. This would expand voting rights to EC citizens in
European parliamentary and local elections, provided they register in time.
The chief difficulty is how to avoid fraudulent voting or dual candidacies
in member states, and how to ensure a common rules system among the 12
without big changes in national legislation.
Ministers agreed to try to introduce rules which would not require primary
legislation. Several member states argued that the introduction of primary
legislation would make it virtually impossible to amend the law in time for
next year's European parliamentary vote.
One option is to introduce a 'light' Community directive amending national
election laws this year, with comprehensive legislation due to be agreed
after 1994.
Legislation expanding the right of European citizens to vote in foreign
member states remains dependent on final ratification of the Maastricht
treaty.

THE European Community will this week threaten Croatia with trade sanctions
unless it halts aggression in Bosnia, EC foreign ministers agreed yesterday.
Mr Willy Claes, Belgian foreign minister, will deliver the warning during a
trip to former Yugoslavia, where he is also due to meet the Serb and Bosnian
Moslem leaders.
Mr Claes' mission follows weekend talks in Geneva aimed at persuading
Bosnia's Moslems to accept a UN-EC brokered plan to turn Bosnia into a
confederation of three republics.
During a meeting in Brussels yesterday, divisions emerged over how tough a
policy to adopt toward Croatia. The UK and France were ready to withdraw
existing EC trade privileges, but Germany warned that this could trigger an
exodus among the 750,000 refugees in Croatia.
Mr Claes will visit former Yugoslavia on behalf of the Belgian presidency of
the EC. He will urge the Bosnian Moslems to take part in the UN-EC
negotiations, while warning President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia that a
political settlement must be acceptable to all parties, including a 'viable
Moslem entity' in Bosnia.
The Belgian foreign minister will not travel as part of the EC 'troika' of
past, present and future presidencies. The inclusion of Greece, which take
over the EC presidency in January, might have proved controversial because
of the Athens government's close ties to Serbia.
Diplomats said yesterday this was a further sign of the difficulties of
reaching a common EC foreign and security policy as envisaged under the
Maastricht treaty.
Mr Douglas Hurd, UK foreign secretary, urged member states to intensify the
humanitarian aid effort to head off a potential disaster this winter.
The Community had provided 68 per cent of the emergency aid to former
Yugoslavia, with the UK having stumped up Dollars 68m (Pounds 45m) plus an
additional Dollars 27m at last week's UN conference in Geneva.
Mr Hurd insisted that aid was flowing to the besieged Moslem populations and
raised hopes that the UN may be able to muster the minimum 7,500 troops
required to defend the six designated 'safe havens.'
Laura Silber adds from Belgrade: Mr Vitaly Churkin, the Russian peace envoy,
yesterday met Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic in Belgrade. He urged the
leaders of all sides to stop the fighting in Bosnia so that top-level talks
could take place in Geneva.
While the Russian envoy described as 'positive' his meeting with Mr
Milosevic, he conceded that they had a 'difficult' discussion on Serbia's
decision to expel the mission of the Conference for Security and
Co-operation in Europe.
Mr Milosevic so far has refused to extend the mandate for the international
monitors of human and minority rights in Serbia.

FT  20 JUL 93 / Sicily shows way to clean-up: A new law designed to get the
influence of the Mafia out of local public-works planning and construction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN US troops stormed Sicilian beaches at Gela in July 1943, the small town
they captured was one of thousands of island communities mired in poverty
and decimated by emigration.
Half a century later, Gela, its population now swollen to 80,000, is
suffering a different, but equally chronic, ill: organised crime. Public
services are a shambles; the council, suspected of collusion with the Mafia,
has been replaced by a special administrator from Rome; and illegal building
has buried ancient Greek remains under a mountain of concrete.
Much of the damage has been done by poorly planned and badly executed
public-works projects, their construction often influenced by
Mafia-dominated organised crime. Needless roads, derelict houses and
unfinished public buildings testify to the Mafia's infiltration of the
building industry. To make matters worse, the work is seldom done well.
The Mafia, leaning mostly on small and medium-sized construction companies,
has traditionally demanded protection money, putting builders indirectly
under mob influence. Increasingly, however, criminal organisations have also
been creating their own companies to tap the lucrative construction market
directly.
Mrs Alice Grassi, widow of a Palermo businessman murdered for refusing to
pay protection money, recalls the gradual escalation of pressure through
telephone warnings and dead animals outside the factory gates to persuade
her husband to bend. Unlike Mr Grassi, many businessmen eventually give way,
paying bribes in a slow process that sometimes ends with ceding control of
their companies to their new 'partners'.
Earlier this year, a new Sicilian law intended to clean up public-sector
construction contracts and loosen the Mafia's grip on building took effect.
With construction in mainland Italy now in turmoil because of the political
corruption scandal, some Sicilians think their new rules could be a model
for the rest of the country.
'We had two aims,' says Mr Franco Magro, a Republican politician who became
the island's public works minister after regional elections in 1992. 'To
reduce the number of people who could award contracts, and to remove
politicians from managing public works'.
The new law has replaced the 1,400 bodies allowed to initiate building
projects with one office for each of the island's nine provinces.
Concentrating responsibility in far fewer hands has removed the powers of
local authorities, which might have been under Mafia control, and made
tendering much more transparent. 'Anyone who wants information about new
contracts now knows just where to go. Previously, responsibilities were
often duplicated and it was very difficult to find out who was in charge,'
says Mr Magro.
The stress on information should also help local authorities set budget
priorities more clearly. Even when not influenced by organised crime,
preliminary plans for new projects were often extremely vague.
Often, the vagueness was deliberate, says Mr Magro. 'It was in the interest
of politicians and builders to keep the plans unclear. Once a tender had
been accepted, variations didn't require a new round of bidding. As the
project grew, so did the kickbacks to politicians.'
The new Sicilian law demands much greater detail about a project and forbids
variations once approved. 'Public authorities must now explain why a
contract is necessary and how it fits in with other schemes.'
In addition they must declare from the start how much it will cost and how
long it will take. While that might sound elementary, such rules were seldom
observed in the past.
Mr Magro admits there has been resistance to the new law, notably from civil
servants who have lost their powers of patronage. Some builders have also
complained about additional bureaucracy.
Any company wanting to compete for public contracts must obtain a
certificate from the local prefect verifying it is not linked to the Mafia.
This involves checking police files and official data for any trace of a
link.
Critics say certification requirements, which have been operating for a
decade, have not loosened the Mafia's grip on construction. 'The problem was
that not enough was done in the past,' responds Mr Magro. 'The Mafia always
tries to use honest citizens as front men. The controls will be even tighter
now.'
Mr Magro admits that centralising construction contracts will put those
running the system at great personal risk. The provincial offices are also
obvious targets for Mafia infiltration.
The collusion of politicians with organised crime has been the main barrier
to good government and efficient services in Sicily for decades, says Mr
Magro. Many politicians have either been linked to the mob or have closed a
blind eye to line their own pockets.
But by 'depersonalising' the contract process and appointing reputable
public servants such as retired judges and prefects to supervise it the
residents of Gela, and hundreds of towns like it, hope that the new system
will remain above board.

</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Jacques Delors, European Commission president, last night rounded on
ministers for backing away from an outline agreement on the Community's
structural funds budget.
Mr Delors was summoned to ministerial talks by the Belgian presidency of the
EC, after deep divisions emerged over apportionment of Ecu141.5bn (Pounds
107bn) of structural funds among member states over the next six years.
Eight countries, including Britain, objected to Commission proposals for
sharing out what is the largest ever EC aid package to run-down regions.
Mr Delors, still suffering from sciatica, arrived late last night and
criticised greedy member states. 'There is an anti-European spirit today in
the Community,' he said. In a tough address to ministers, he said: 'I am
sticking to my promises, but you must not go back on your commitments.'
Mr Delors intervened a fortnight ago to try to mollify Ireland, which has
been holding out for IPounds 8bn (Pounds 7.5bn) over seven years. But his
IPounds 7.5bn (Pounds 7.1bn) counter-offer is understood to have upset Mr
Bruce Millan, commissioner responsible for the regional aid budget.
This offer triggered an avalanche of counter-claims from other states. One
EC official said member states' bids were 25 per cent above the total agreed
at last December's summit in Edinburgh.
The eight member states raising objections are Britain, the Netherlands,
France, and Italy, as well as the four poorer EC countries, Ireland, Spain,
Portugal and Greece.
Denmark, Germany, Luxembourg and Belgium have indicated a willingness to go
along.
Mr Millan is understood to have offered Ireland IPounds 6.5bn, a sum Irish
officials dismissed as unrealistic. Mr Albert Reynolds, Irish prime
minister, claims to have received a guarantee of IPounds 8bn at Edinburgh.
Earlier this month, EC foreign ministers met until 4am to reach a deal on
rules for allocation of structural funds, but with an Irish reservation.

<TEXT>
SERB forces yesterday resumed their offensive on Mount Igman, a key point in
the defence of Sarajevo, stepping up pressure on Bosnia's President Alija
Izetbegovic to attend peace talks on the republic's ethnic partition.
Sarajevo radio reported heavy fighting after Serbs launched a three-pronged
attack on the hill, which dominates and protects Bosnia's capital from the
south.
The mainly Moslem Bosnian forces held their positions despite an overnight
armoured Serb assault, according to an army statement. Belgrade radio
confirmed the clashes around Igman but claimed Moslems had shelled Ilidza, a
Serb-held suburb, prompting the Serbian counterattack.
Last night Bosnia's 10-man presidency expressed doubt about the value of
attending the Geneva peace talks while the Serb advance continued. However,
Bosnian radio said the presidency had indicated it was ready to attend and
had agreed on a delegation.
The defeats around Sarajevo apparently led the Bosnian presidency to sack Mr
Mustafa Hajrulajovic, commander of the first army corps.
United Nations observers were denied access to Igman by Serb forces on the
grounds that it was too dangerous.
Relief workers were worried about the possible influx of 30,000 refugees
from the Igman area. 'This could be a staggering and extremely tragic event
because there is no spare capacity for people to be housed in Sarajevo,'
said Mr Peter Kessler, of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
UN workers rescued 230 severely retarded children in hospital in Fojnica, 30
miles west of Sarajevo. Relief workers last night were trying to negotiate
the passage of an emergency food convoy to the handicapped children, who had
not been fed in three days. They discovered five babies in critical
condition who, along with the children, had been abandoned when the town
fell last week to Moslem forces, reported Sarajevo radio.

<TEXT>
THE Treuhand agency for restructuring and privatising eastern German
industry has reversed its decision to close a loss-making potash mine, in a
move to ensure its radical plan to merge western and eastern Germany's
potash sector is implemented, writes Judy Dempsey in Berlin.
The decision to reprieve 700 jobs at the Bischofferoder mine in Thuringia
follows a two-week hunger strike by 47 employees.
The Treuhand and the state government propose that the mine should stay open
temporarily to save jobs until 1995.
The agency originally envisaged closing Bischofferoder as part of a package
to merge Kali + Salz, a BASF subsidiary, with Mitteldeutschen Kali, the east
German producer. With the merger, the Treuhand aimed to save the remaining
five eastern German mines, and reduce severe overcapacity.
As part of its merger plan, the Treuhand has already made two unprecedented
moves. First, it proposed the west German sector share the burden in
reducing the workforce. The number of jobs at Kali + Salz will be cut by
1,744 to 4,488, and at Mitteldeutschen Kali by 1,884 to 3,012.
Second, the Treuhand has taken a 49 per cent stake, worth DM1bn, in the
merger, with an option to sell its share after five years.

</HEADLINE>

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRANCE'S constitution was changed yesterday to make it easier to prosecute
government ministers accused of misconduct and to insulate the judiciary
from political influence.
The National Assembly and Senate, sitting jointly in the palace at
Versailles, as they do only for constitutional revisions, voted for a less
politicised impeachment procedure than that by which Mr Laurent Fabius and
two other former Socialist ministers are to be tried for alleged
responsibiity in the contamination of blood supplies with the HIV virus.
Four former public health officials involved in the same case, had their
prison sentences confirmed by the appeal court last week.
Under the existing impeachment procedure - to be retained only for
accusations involving the president - parliament brings the charges and sits
in judgment on them. In future, anyone will be able to bring actual or
former ministers before a magistrates' court for crimes committed in the
exercise of office.
The magistrates will determine whether charges should be brought. Only at
the trial stage will six deputies and six senators be included on the
judges' bench.
The case of HIV-contaminated blood, for which many relatives of the infected
haemophiliacs have held former ministers responsible, has been the catalyst
for reform. Mr Fabius, who was prime minister in 1984-86, actually voted
last December in favour of his own impeachment so he could clear his name.
However, that impeachment move was overtaken by the parliamentary elections
in March and President Francois Mitterrand's proposals for constitutional
reform.
The only other reform approved yesterday was to dilute the president's power
of appointment to the higher judiciary council which nominates and
disciplines magistrates and judges.
Accusations that France's magistrates come under undue influence from the
government as well as the presidency have been echoed in recent days by Mr
Bernard Tapie. A former minister, he owns the Olympique-Marseilles football
team which is now under investigation for bribery.

The common new generation frigate will be the first big maritime

It is an extension of a planned Anglo-French frigate which has been

following year. Italy joined the programme earlier this year.
The UK Defence Ministry said that although a commitment to take the project
to the production stage had been signed, the programme 'is still at a very
early stage'.
The frigate, which should be in service within seven years, is intended to
replace the Royal Navy's Type 42 air-defence destroyers, which were at the
forefront of the naval campaign in the Gulf war.

THE Treuhand, the agency charged with restructuring and privatising eastern
German industry, has reversed its decision to close a loss-making potash
mine, in a move to ensure its radical plan to merge western and eastern
Germany's potash sector is implemented.
The decision to give a reprieve to 700 jobs at the Bischofferoder mine in
the state of Thuringia follows a two-week hunger strike by 47 employees.
Five hunger strikers have been admitted to hospital.
The Treuhand and the state government propose that the mine should stay open
temporarily to save jobs until 1995.
The Treuhand originally envisaged closing Bischofferoder as part of a
package to merge Kali + Salz, a BASF subsidiary, with Mitteldeutschen Kali,
the east German producer. With the merger, the Treuhand aimed to save the
remaining five eastern German mines, and reduce capacity in an industry
plagued by overcapacity. Last year, 35m tonnes were produced worldwide but
less than 25m tonnes sold. Before 1989, eastern Germany's potash mines were
producing more than 3m tonnes a year with a workforce of 33,000, compared to
western Germany's annual production of 2.4m with 11,000 employees.
As part of its merger plan, the Treuhand has already made two unprecedented
moves. Firstly, it proposed that the western Germany potash sector should
share the burden in reducing the workforce. The number of jobs at Kali +
Salz will be reduced by 1,744 to 4,488, and at Mitteldeutschen Kali by 1,884
to 3,012.
Secondly, the Treuhand has taken a 49 per cent stake, worth DM1bn, in the
merger, with an option to sell its share after five years.
Mr Helmut Ballon, the Treuhand's director of mining and non-metallic
minerals, has said: 'We had to think of reducing capacity. We decided on a
radical approach which would not only save jobs, but perhaps give a new
lease of life to Germany's potash industry.' The DM1bn will be earmarked for
restructuring Mitteldeutschen Kali and covering losses.
The merger followed 48 unsuccessful attempts to seek foreign partners for
the east German industry. It will need European Community approval because
it will create a virtual monopoly in Germany's potash sector. A Treuhand
official yesterday expected the Commission would rule in favour of the
merger, since total German capacity would be reduced to an annual 3.1m
tonnes. A decision is expected next month.

<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IF Mr Norman Lamont conducted his dialogue with the German financial and
industrial establishment via unfriendly newspaper headlines, his successor
as Chancellor of the Exchequer is trying a more intimate approach.
On Sunday night, Mr Kenneth Clarke dined at the Schloss Hotel, Kronberg, an
imposing gothic palace built in the hills outside Frankfurt by a daughter of
Queen Victoria. Amid memorabilia celebrating ties between the English and
German royal families, Clarke sought to bolster present-day relations
between the two countries, hosting a dinner for 11 of Germany's top bankers
and industrialists.
Yesterday morning, he found himself in the congenial surroundings of the
Frankfurter Club, an elegant, wood-panelled mansion built in 1896 which
houses an institution deliberately modelled on English gentlemen's clubs of
yore. There he talked to 14 journalists, before driving round to the twin
towers of the Deutsche Bank, where he met Mr Hilmar Kopper - the bank's
chief executive - and three other board members.
After that it was off to lunch at the Bundesbank, where officials report
that he spent a good 20 minutes in private conversation with Mr Hans
Tietmeyer, soon to replace Mr Helmut Schlesinger as president of the German
central bank.
After the rumpus over sterling's exit from the exchange rate mechanism last
autumn, Mr Clarke's visit to Frankfurt - and later to Munich - was viewed by
German businessmen as a welcome attempt to poor oil on unnecessarily
troubled waters. Mr Lamont had been happy to blame the rumpus on loose words
from Mr Schlesinger, contained in an 'unauthorised' interview with the
Handelsblatt newspaper which set off what UK politicians claimed was a
'whispering campaign' to undermine sterling.
One banker described Mr Clarke's visit as a 'a very intelligent diplomatic
move'. Another, who attended one of the meetings yesterday, said that it
hardly mattered that the discussion of the outlook for the German and UK
economies was conducted at 'a relatively superficial level': it was Mr
Clarke's willingness to come to Germany and exchange views which mattered.
Bankers said they were impressed by the direct way Mr Clarke answered
questions.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MAGISTRATES in Naples yesterday requested authority from the justice
minister and parliament to arrest Mr Francesco De Lorenzo, the former health
minister, on charges of forming a criminal association, illicit financing of
political parties and false billing.
The 800-page document sent to parliament, where Mr De Lorenzo enjoys
immunity as a Liberal deputy, cited 35 separate incidents of corruption that
allegedly produced L4.15bn (Pounds 1.73m) in kickbacks. This is one of the
most damning series of accusations to be levelled against a politician since
the scandals broke.
Among those levelling accusations against Mr De Lorenzo for abusing the
L100,000bn annual health budget are his former private secretary, Mr Gianni
Marone, now co-operating with the authorities, and 13 pharmaceutical
companies. The latter include three multinationals, Ciba-Geigy, Lepetit, and
Smith Kline Beecham.
The magistrates allege Mr De Lorenzo orchestrated an operation in
conjunction with senior officials that took bribes for placing
pharmaceuticals on the ministry's list of approved drugs and establishing
their pricing. His arrest was necessary to prevent interference with the
investigation, the magistrates said.
In another development yesterday, Rome magistrates arrested Mr Antonio
Galati, the administrative head of Sisde, the domestic intelligence service.
The magistrates are investigating the misappropriation of L14bn of the
organisation's funds.

FT  20 JUL 93 / Boots withdraws heart drug after two-year study
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOOTS, the UK drugs retailer and manufacturer, yesterday withdrew its heart
drug Manoplax, dealing a serious blow to its ambitions in the world
pharmaceutical market.
A two-year study has shown that patients taking light doses of the drug were
more likely to be readmitted to hospital than those using a placebo. Earlier
this year, the same study had found that heavy dosages caused more deaths.
The heavy dosage was then withdrawn in the UK, but not in the US, the only
other market in which the drug had obtained clearance.
The company had since given up attempts to obtain registration elsewhere in
the world.
The clinical trials leading to yesterday's decision involved 3,000 patients
in North America and Scandinavia between July 1991 and April this year. In
April it was established that patients taking the heavier 100mg dose for
congestive heart failure were more likely to die than those taking an active
placebo. Last week, Boots found that further scrutiny of the same data
showed patients on the lighter 75mg dose being readmitted to hospital in
larger numbers.
The company had previously held out high hopes for the drug, which cost an
estimated Pounds 100m to develop. However, the City had come to regard these
claims with scepticism because of delays and rising costs.
The move leaves Boots without any patented drugs on the market. The last
drug of its own invention to be launched in the UK was the anti-arthritis
drug Froben in 1977.
Boots said the move would cost it Pounds 35m in stock write-offs and
'provisions against manufacturing facilities'. It said there would be no
factory closures at either of the two sites making Manoplax, at Nottingham
and Cramlington, Northumberland. Job losses, however, could not be ruled
out.
Boots said it did not expect any litigation as a result of the study's
findings. 'We have behaved in the usual ethical way,' the company said.
'This is an unfortunate outcome of an additional clinical trial we chose to
undertake.'
The company said it would save on marketing expenses for the drug, which
last year cost Pounds 20m, and on research and development.
The net effect would be a slight increase in profits and cash flow. Its
shares rose 13p to 435p. Analysts said this was partly because of hopes that
the company would decide to sell off its drug division, which has been
widely seen as too small to be viable.
The company denied any such plans yesterday.

FT  20 JUL 93 / Medeva shares hit by profits warning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MEDEVA, a rapidly growing UK-based drugs company, yesterday saw its stock
market value collapse from Pounds 589m to Pounds 316m after it issued a
profits warning.
Mr Bernard Taylor, chairman, said pre-tax profits for 1993 would be about
Pounds 10m below market expectations of Pounds 53m-Pounds 57m. In
exceptionally heavy selling, Medeva's shares lost nearly half their value,
falling from 216p to 116p.
Investors were most disturbed by news that Medeva had closed MD
Pharmaceutical, a US subsidiary making amphetamines, for two weeks to comply
with operational changes required by the Food and Drug Administration. Mr
Taylor said Medeva did not know when the FDA would determine whether the
changes made were adequate.
Medeva's share price collapse came less than three months after the group
raised Pounds 94m in a rights issue at 180p. That cash call helped fund an
acquisition in Germany but also repaid debt and gave Medeva a war chest with
which it had hoped to make further acquisitions up to a value of Pounds
100m.
Mr Ian Gowrie-Smith, managing director and architect of Medeva's rapid
growth since it came to the stock market in 1987, said there was nothing
wrong with the strategy to expand by acquisition rather than drug companies'
more conventional route of research and development.
'The company is still on track to increase profits this year,' he said. 'We
are still en route to being one of the most successful companies in
corporate British history.'
The bulk of the problems arose at IMS, a Californian subsidiary that makes
drug delivery systems such as plastic tubes. It was acquired for Dollars 29m
in June 1992. Medeva said it discovered last week that stock levels at the
warehouses of independent wholesalers had doubled since the acquisition.
Stock reduction and lower production levels for the rest of the year meant
IMS would be unlikely to make a profit in 1993. Medeva bought IMS for a drug
used to treat heart attack victims, which it hopes will soon receive FDA
approval.
Mr Taylor said the group had shut the plant at MD Pharmaceutical which makes
methylphenidate, an amphetamine, to deal more easily with the FDA concerns.
Mr Gowrie-Smith said the FDA had been most concerned about the way in which
MD dealt with complaints and that procedures had been tightened.

FT  20 JUL 93 / High Court move delays treaty: Rees-Mogg wins right to
challenge way government handled Maastricht bill
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH and JOHN MASON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT conceded yesterday that the UK's ratification of the
Maastricht treaty will have to await the outcome of a legal challenge on
behalf of the anti-Maastricht campaign.
Its decision came as the opposing camps at Westminster stepped up their
preparations for Thursday's critical Commons debate on the social chapter.
It means ratification will be delayed until the autumn.
As Tory Eurosceptics met to lay their plans, they expressed confidence that
they would defeat the government and put a further obstacle in the way of
ratification. But in an atmosphere of intrigue and bluff, the possibility of
a government deal with the nine MPs of the Ulster Unionist party was raised
as it was announced that Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary,
would meet unionist MPs on Thursday afternoon.
With all sides agreeing that the votes of the minor parties are likely to
determine the result of the debate, there was a further glimmer of light for
the government with a split emerging among the Liberal Democrats over voting
tactics.
Although Mr John Major has said he does not regard it as a confidence issue,
a defeat would undermine his battered authority. Yesterday, even loyalists
who said they believed the government would win admitted that, on paper,
they did not see how a defeat could be avoided.
If all the opposition parties vote together and are joined by 10 Tory MPs,
the government's 18-strong overall majority would be overturned.
The Eurosceptics were encouraged by the decision of two High Court judges to
allow Lord Rees-Mogg, a leading critic of the prime minister, to apply for a
judicial review of the government's planned ratification of the treaty. At
the review, which begins next Monday, Lord Rees-Mogg will seek a court order
preventing ratification of the treaty in its present form because, he
claims, the government's approach is legally and constitutionally flawed.
The government made no attempt to block Lord Rees-Mogg's move yesterday,
saying it did not want the application obstructed. Lawyers for Mr Douglas
Hurd, the foreign secretary, went on to say the government had no intention
of ratifying the treaty before the conclusion of the court proceedings.
Downing Street emphasised that the government would oppose the substance of
the challenge.
Applying for the review, lawyers for Lord Rees-Mogg argued the government
was using the royal prerogative to bypass parliament in a way not attempted
since Stuart times. Modern legal authorities had demonstrated that the
government's attitude was legally unsustainable.
Lord Rees-Mogg's legal challenge will be based on three main grounds - the
transfer of the foreign policy prerogative to Brussels, the increase in the
powers of the European Parliament and the exclusion of the social protocol.
The judicial review is expected to be completed within the week when the
courts rise for the summer. This would leave time for any appeal by the
government to be heard during August.
At Westminster, there was confusion about how the Commons debate would be
affected by the matter's becoming sub judice as a result of the legal
challenge.
Government tactics seemed to be aimed at forming different coalitions on the
two separate votes at the end of the debate. There was a suggestion that if
the Labour amendment - that the government should not ratify the treaty
until it has committed itself to the social chapter - were passed, ministers
might not vote against the amended motion.
This was apparently intended to win support for the government on the first
vote among those Eurosceptics who want to stall ratification by ensuring
that MPs reject the final motion so that the technical requirement for a
parliamentary resolution is not met. If the Labour amendment is defeated,
the Liberal Democrats may vote with the government in order to allow
ratification to proceed.

FT  20 JUL 93 / Opec calls emergency meeting after oil prices fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WORLD OIL prices tumbled yesterday to their lowest level since the Gulf war
in 1991 as prospects for an accord between the United Nations and Iraq
allowing limited oil sales brightened.
But the market recovered ground later in the day after the Organisation of
Petroleum Exporting Countries announced it would hold an emergency meeting
on July 28.
Iraq's acceptance over the weekend of long-term UN monitoring of two missile
testing sites led market traders to expect an early outcome to separate
talks on the sale of Dollars 1.6bn (Pounds 1.06bn) of oil to pay for
humanitarian aid.
Mr Rolf Ekeus, the UN arms envoy, said that Baghdad's agreement to
monitoring had helped clear away one of the obstacles preventing the full
lifting of economic sanctions. An end to sanctions would herald the return
of Iraq to the oil market.
Prices for North Sea Brent crude to be delivered in September closed in
London at Dollars 16.71 a barrel after touching Dollars 15.98. The market
was 5 cents higher than Friday's official close, although prices had fallen
further in after-hours trading last week. In New York, the August crude
futures contract dropped 46 cents to a three-year low of Dollars 16.75 a
barrel before bouncing back to Dollars 17.70 on news of the Opec meeting.
Mr Joe Stanislaw, industry analyst at Cambridge Energy Research Associates
in Boston, said: 'It's the worst of all possible worlds for the oil market
because of the lack of clarity over what is happening. That will lead to
more price volatility over the coming days.'
Opec members were galvanised into calling the emergency meeting in Vienna
because they are worried about the fall in oil prices and the possible
return of Iraq to the well-supplied export market. Mr Jean Ping, Gabon's oil
minister and current president of Opec, will embark on a tour of the Middle
East tomorrow to consult members.
It will be difficult for Opec to plan any decisive action until the terms of
an agreement on Iraqi oil sales - if there is one - become known. Opec
nations will strongly resist giving up market share by cutting production.
Ms Irene Himona, energy analyst at Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull, the
London securities house, cautioned on the outcome of an inconclusive Opec
meeting. 'If the organisation emerges with a lack of credibility for the
market, then prices could fall as far as Dollars 10 a barrel,' she said.

FT  19 JUL 93 / French Government Bonds: Issues hold up well in face of
weakening franc
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CURRENCY markets have been casting a shadow over the French bond market,
as a series of attacks against the franc have raised the question of whether
the French government is prepared to raise interest rates to defend the
current parity within the European exchange rate mechanism.
Such considerations were evident in last Thursday's FFr18bn bond issue. The
issue of two-year and five-year bonds went reasonably smoothly, although the
shorter-term issue reflected anxieties about the currency market.
It saw an average yield of 5.95 per cent, which is higher than expected and
compares with 6.16 per cent at the last auction in June. The five-year bond
saw an average yield of 6.13 per cent, compared with 6.36 per cent at the
June auction.
In general, however, bond analysts said that French issues had held up
reasonably well in the face of the weakening franc.
Spreads on French 10-year bonds over German bunds narrowed from 24 points to
14 points over the course of the week, while the short-term end of the
market stayed relatively stable.
'We were seeing increased buying interest in French bonds at the end of last
week,' says Ms Marie Owens Thomsen, international economist at Midland
Capital Markets.
She says that with French yields back above German ones at virtually every
maturity, there is again the attraction of capital gains on French bonds.
But this attraction may be short-lived if the current turbulence within the
ERM forces the French government to resort to an increase in interest rates.
'If the speculators really try and prise the franc out of the ERM, which is
possible, then the French government isn't going to have much choice,' said
one analyst.
Inflationary prospects in France will be one factor preventing yields
slipping below those on German bonds again in the near future.
Consumer price statistics for June, released last week showed stable
inflation, the result of falls in the prices of food and oil, but the impact
of increased indirect taxes introduced in July - including a rise in petrol
taxes - suggests that inflation will pick up in the second half of the year.
One economist at a Paris-based bank said he expected year-on-year inflation
to be nearer 2.5 per cent in July, as against 2 per cent in June.
In addition to the two-year and five-year issues, last Thursday also saw an
extraordinary repo issue, the result of the successful launch of the
'Balladur bond'. Official results, released on Monday, confirmed the bond
had attracted about FFr110bn, almost three times the target level.
Thursday's issue of BTFs (short-term money market instruments) was designed
to counteract the drain on the money markets as subscribers to the Balladur
bond settled their accounts on Friday.
The extraordinary repo issue did not, however, fully compensate for the
drain on the market. And combined with sale of about FFr60bn of BTFs earlier
in the week, there was a strong tightening of liquidity.
The oversubscription of the Balladur bond - which yields 6 per cent and has
a maturity of four years - will not necessarily reduce the French
government's future capital raising plans. 'They ought to overfund in this
kind of environment,' said one economist. 'It might make sense to issue more
bonds than they need now. It is likely to be more difficult later.'

FT  19 JUL 93 / UK Gilts: Auction prospect prompts pause for breath
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOME of the froth came off the recent rise in UK government bonds last week,
as investors reacted negatively to the announcement about the next gilt
auction and indications of continuing fiscal weakness.
In recent weeks gilts have enjoyed a purple patch, with long-bond yields
dropping to their lowest levels for 20 years.
The market now seems likely to pause for breath while weighing up the large
volume of issues that will be needed to finance the high public sector
borrowing requirement for 1993-94.
The Bank of England will on July 28 auction an unspecified amount of stock
maturing between 1998 and 2001. It will announce tomorrow the details of the
bonds and how much will be sold. Market estimates are that some Pounds
3.25bn of securities will be on offer.
The announcement on Friday helped the long end of the gilt market, with
yields above the 10-year level continuing their generally downward movement.
However, prices of 10-year bonds fell more than  1/4 point on Friday, in
reaction to news of the auction and that government borrowing in the first
three months of the financial year rose by nearly a quarter on the
corresponding period of 1992-93.
Public borrowing between April and June was Pounds 13.2bn, compared with
Pounds 10.7bn in the same period a year earlier. Many in the gilt market
were more interested in these details than in the smaller than expected
borrowing figure for June.
This was caused largely by unusually high government receipts, arising from
individuals and companies paying their tax bills in June rather than later
in the summer.
In spite of the extra cash flowing into the Treasury due to this trend, the
PSBR for the month still came out at a high Pounds 3.88bn, partly because of
a big rise in government spending triggered by high social security outlays
due to the recession.
Even with the setback to fortunes of the 10-year stock on Friday, gilts of
this maturity showed an impressive rise on the week. The 8 per cent bond
maturing in 2003 was quoted on Friday night at 103 7/8 , nearly 1/2 point up
on the previous Friday. Its yield fell to 7.43 per cent from 7.51 per cent a
week earlier.
Longer-dated securities saw a yield fall of a similar scale on the week,
while short-dated gilts moved sideways as expectations of an early cut in
bank base rates all but petered out.
Gilts maturing in 20 to 25 years have performed particularly well in recent
weeks. Since early May, 25-year bonds have seen yields drop from about 8.5
per cent to 7.7 per cent. Over the same period, yields for 10-year
securities have come down from 8.2 per cent.
Assuming inflation data over the next few months are as positive as were the
figures last week, it is fair to assume that longer-dated gilts will see a
further period of steady price increases. The market was particularly
heartened by fresh signs that wage pressures are declining, coming from news
that average earnings across the economy rose an underlying 3.75 per cent in
the year to May, the lowest figure for 26 years.
In a further sign of low inflation, wages per unit of output in
manufacturing in the three months to May declined by 3.6 per cent compared
with the same period last year. This is the biggest year-on-year fall since
the Department of Employment started records in 1970.
Meanwhile, prices of factory-made goods for domestic sale rose by just 4 per
cent in the year to June, the same as in the year to May, while the
year-on-year rise in the retail prices index dropped in June to 1.2 per
cent, the lowest figure for nearly 30 years.
The message from these figures is that manufacturing is leading the
recovery. There are few signs of any significant build-up in consumer
spending, nor of price pressures at the level of wages and retail goods
Supporting these indications, a chairman of a big food company said last
week that the food business was in a 'horrible' state. In contrast,
manufacturing output in May registered its biggest monthly output increase
for four years, with production up 1.8 per cent on the April level.
The release this Wednesday of the figures for last month's retail sales
volumes will be watched with interest in the gilt market. Prices are likely
to rise should the figures turn out weak.

FT  19 JUL 93 / International Company News: Mexican media sale nets Dollars
641m for government
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE Mexican government has sold two state-owned television networks, a
string of cinemas and other media companies for 2bn pesos (Dollars 641m) to
Radio-televisora del Centro, a company formed by the owners of Grupo
Elektra, the electrical and white goods chain.
The new company will be controlled by Mr Ricardo Salinas Pliego, president
and principal owner of Grupo Elektra. It will become Mexico's second-largest
media group after Televisa, the powerful television, radio and newspaper
concern.
Radiotelevisora bid some 30 per cent more than the runner-up in the
privatisation, Cosmovision.
Radiotelevisora will look for domestic and foreign partners to help it
compete with Televisa, which has about 90 per cent of Mexico's television
market and owns stakes in Univision, the principal Spanish-language station
in the US, and the Peruvian broadcaster, Radio Defusion de Peruana. Televisa
also has links with TCI, the world's largest cable company, among others.
The new company is also expected to invest heavily in improving the run-down
former state-owned cinema chain. The government recently gave the industry a
boost by removing controls on cinema ticket prices.
The government decided not to sell the state-owned newspaper El Nacional, on
the grounds that the highest offer was not sufficient.
The newspaper, which staunchly supports the ruling Institutional
Revolutionary Party but which is believed to be loss-making, will thus
continue to be run and subsidised by the government.
Privately-owned Grupo Elektra is Mexico's largest consumer electronics
chain, with some 275 stores. It imports, makes and assembles televisions,
white goods, radio equipment and other electronic goods, and through a
subsidiary, offers personal radio communications.

FT  19 JUL 93 / International Company News: Portman acquires Zenith
Productions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PORTMAN Entertainment, one of the UK's longest established independent
production companies, has bought Zenith Productions from Carlton
Communications and Paramount Communications of the US.
Zenith and Zenith North, based in Newcastle, have been on the market for
some time. Best known for television programmes such as Inspector Morse and
films such as Prick Up Your Ears, they were put up for sale following
Carlton's successful bid for the London weekday ITV franchise.
An ITV broadcaster can hold no more than a 15 per cent stake in an
independent television production company.
Portman was founded in 1944. It was restructured a year ago with more than
Dollars 5m (Pounds 3.3m) of new financing in a deal struck with Television
Enterprise and Asset Management, backed by Rockefeller in the US and Robert
Fleming, the merchant bank, and Primetime, the independent producer, in the
UK.
The price of the deal was not revealed, although a statement referred to 'a
transfer of shares'. Mr Bernard Cragg, Carlton's finance director said he
was pleased to have found 'a suitable home for Zenith so that the company
will be able to continue to supply high quality independent programmes to
the ITV and other broadcasters'.

FT  19 JUL 93 / International Company News: EMC plans to double capacity of
Irish plant

<TEXT>
EMC, a fast-growing US manufacturer of computer data storage and retrieval
systems, has announced that it plans to double the capacity of its
manufacturing facility in Cork, in the Irish Republic.
The expansion, which is scheduled for completion by the end of the year,
will create about 120 new jobs in a region that has been hard hit by cuts at
other computer companies, including Digital Equipment.
EMC's products include data storage systems for use with IBM mainframe and
mid-range computers, as well as Unisys mainframes.
Most of the company's revenues derive from its Direct Access Storage Device
(DASD) product line, which competes with similar products offered by IBM.
The company is also an early leader in the emerging disk array market, for
data storage systems based upon a collection of small disk drives, such as
those used in personal computers.
Disk arrays provide faster data retrieval as well as offering higher storage
capacity than conventional data storage systems.
On Friday, the company reported record results for the second quarter of
1993, with a 115 per cent increase in revenues to Dollars 170.9m and net
earnings of Dollars 27m, compared with Dollars 6.1m for the second quarter
of last year.
Revenue from a recent agreement to supply Groupe Bull, the French computer
company, with disk array products is running ahead of plan, said Mr John
Egan, EMC executive vice-president.
The company said that it has received assistance from Irish development
authorities for the Dollars 20m manufacturing expansion, which will help EMC
serve the European and Asian markets.
In the US, EMC last week officially opened a new 62,000 square foot
manufacturing facility at its headquarters in Hopkinton, Massachusetts.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BACKED by its secured banking creditors, UK Land plans a reconstruction of
capital and the raising of Pounds 256,000 (Dollars 384,000) to meet that
expense through a fully underwritten rights offer.
This will provide UKL with a 'sound financial base' from which it can
develop by maximising the revenues from the Elephant &amp; Castle shopping
centre in London, its main asset, and subsequently seeking property
acquisitions.
The alternatives to the plan are insolvent liquidation, administration or
receivership.
Every 22 existing ordinary shares will be consolidated into one ordinary of
5p and one deferred of 545p - the latter will later be cancelled.
A total of 5m new ordinaries, or 64.44 per cent of the new capital, will be
issued to creditors. Lloyds Bank will be issued 2m, a syndicate of banks
will get 2.35m in respect of their secured advances, and unsecured creditors
under a company voluntary arrangement will be issued 650,000.
An open offer of up to 2.56m shares at 10p each (33 per cent of the capital)
will be made to shareholders on the basis of 13-for-one. A shareholder with
1,100 existing shares would receive 50 new shares from the consolidation and
be able to subscribe for 650.
Lloyds Bank will also be allotted Pounds 250,000 worth of 10 per cent
convertible secured loan 2003, convertible into 1.84m shares, unless that
pushed Lloyds' holding to more than 29.9 per cent of UKL voting capital.
Issued capital following the proposals will be 7.76m shares, or 9.6m on a
diluted basis. Mr James Grace and Mr Christopher Woodhouse, who are
sub-underwriters, will join the board.
The existing facility from Bank of Scotland will be converted into a Pounds
9m term loan, repayable 1998-2003, and a Pounds 2.3m overdraft, reducing
over the five years to April 1988. The facilities will be secured by a
charge over the Elephant &amp; Castle. Lloyds and the syndicate banks may
require Lillybrook, the underwriter, to purchase up to 2m shares of their
entitlement at 10p each.

BEIJING-controlled Citic Pacific and Mr Li Ka-shing's Cheung Kong have

The offer, which lapsed on Friday, received acceptances equal to only 13.7
per cent of the company's shares and 9.2 per cent of its warrants.
The result of the bid for Miramar, which owns property assets on the Kowloon
peninsula, was a rare defeat for Mr Li and Mr Larry Yung, head of Citic in
Hong Kong.
Henderson Investment, another Hong Kong property group, sealed the fate of
the joint bid after it bought a 35 per cent stake in Miramar from its

BSN, the big French foods and drinks group best known for its range of
yoghurts, is to take a shareholding in Delta, the Greek dairy products
company, Reuter reports from Paris.
The two companies have agreed to an accord which calls for BSN initially to
take 10 per cent of Delta.
No price was given for the deal. Delta had turnover of Dr51bn or some
FFr1.27bn in 1992, and made a net profit of FFr122m, BSN said.
BSN made a net profit last year of FFr3.44bn on sales of FFr70.8bn. It will
bring its expertise to Delta, which will ultimately make yoghurts under the
Danone brand name.
Initially, the Greek company's yoghurts will keep the Delta name. BSN
already has a joint venture in Bulgaria making Danone yoghurts.

FFr8.5bn'

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
COMPTOIR des Entrepreneurs, the French property bank troubled by exposure to
bad loans, will need to raise about FFr8.5bn (Dollars 1.45bn) in bonds or
through other measures this year, according to Mr Francois Lemasson,
chairman.
Mr Lemasson said that the company was facing an overall financing shortfall
of about FFr20bn.
He estimated that about FFr11.5bn could be raised through the sale of assets
and the arrangement of syndicated loans with the group's banks.
The company is also planning to sell its Paris headquarters, but has not yet
decided on an outright sale or a sale and leaseback operation.
CDE is also in the process of negotiating the terms of an issue of
state-guaranteed debt of between FFr1bn and FFr2bn.
Mr Lemasson said that the terms should be finalised within the next few days
and that he hoped to obtain a preferential interest rate on the issue.
The difficulties facing CDE reflect an accumulation of bad loans on
commercial property and the downturn in the French property market.
Construction industry analysts in Paris estimate that the group has about
FFr10bn of risky loans to property companies, on which it has made about
FFr2bn of provisions.

FT  19 JUL 93 / International Company News: MacMillan Bloedel returns to the
black
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GIBBENS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MONTREAL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HIGHER-VALUE wood products for North American and overseas construction
markets enabled MacMillan Bloedel to report a profitable second quarter this
year.
However, the pulp, newsprint and containerboard markets continued to be
weak, said Mr Robert Findlay, president. MacMillan would cut costs further
and concentrate on producing higher-margin products in the most economic
locations, he said.
Second-quarter net profit was CDollars 22.5m (USDollars 17.6m), or 19 cents
a share, against a loss of CDollars 7.1m, or 8 cents a share. Sales were
CDollars 964m, up nearly 25 per cent.
For the first six months of the year, profit was CDollars 68.8m, or 57 cents
a share, against a loss of CDollars 18.1m, or 20 cents a share last time.
Half-year sales were CDollars 1.8bn, up 20 per cent.
Mr Findlay said that in the current six months, North American timber prices
should remain at current lower levels but export prices should average about
first half-levels.
Canadian Pacific Forest Products, one of North America's biggest newsprint
producers, reduced its second-quarter operating loss to CDollars 11m from a
CDollars 53m deficit a year earlier. Sales rose by 6 per cent to CDollars
490m.
For the first six months of 1993, losses totalled CDollars 49m against
CDollars 120m. Half-year sales were 5 per cent higher at CDollars 941m.
Strong wood products markets were the main factor, but newsprint shipments
and prices were higher. Production costs declined and a lower Canadian
dollar helped.
However, the pulp, paperboard and white paper markets were weak and two
joint ventures reported higher losses. Interest expenses rose because of
continuing heavy capital outlays financed through term debt.
Offshore timber products markets were firm in the second quarter, despite a
40 per cent drop in North American prices, but the Japanese market is now
being adversely affected by the recession.
CPFP is raising CDollars 130m by spinning off its wood products business
into a separate, publicly-held subsidiary.
Better demand for fine papers and strong timber products markets helped
Noranda Forest to report its first quarterly profit in three years for the
three months ended June.
Second-quarter net profit was CDollars 4m against a loss of CDollars 21m on
sales of CDollars 374m against CDollars 367m. In February, Noranda sold 49
per cent of MacMillan Bloedel for CDollars 997m: this week it announced the
disposal of 50 per cent of a western fine paper group for CDollars 82m.

FT  19 JUL 93 / International Company News: Liz Claiborne warns of downturn

<TEXT>
LIZ CLAIBORNE, the US fashion designer and clothing manufacturer, dismayed
shareholders on Friday by predicting a 30 per cent decline in full-year
earnings per share for 1993.
The news, which came only a day after the unexpected resignation of the
company's vice-chairman Mr Jay Margolis, sent shares in Liz Claiborne
tumbling by Dollars 6 to Dollars 23 5/8 , their lowest level in several
years.
The stock lost Dollars 1 3/4 on Thursday after news of Mr Margolis's
departure hit the market. Mr Margolis is widely respected in the retail
industry and many had expected him to take the helm when the current
chairman, Mr Jerome Chazen, 65, retires.
Mr Samuel Miller, the company's senior vice-president for finance, blamed
the bleak forecast on weaker than expected consumer spending patterns for
women's apparel, which have left the company with excess inventories.
'We had anticipated that more favourable business trends and improved
results in several of our divisions would enable us to resume growth during
the second half of the year and planned our inventory commitments
accordingly,' he said.
'While we are not happy with the results, at almost 7 per cent of net sales
our earnings are among the highest in the industry and our financial
position remains strong,' Mr Miller added.
For the second quarter, ended June 26, the company posted a 21.3 per cent
decline in net earnings to Dollars 31.1m on sales which were 7.3 per cent
higher at Dollars 506.9m.
A year earlier, net income was Dollars 39.5m on sales of Dollars 472.6m.
Earnings per share fell by 19.1 per cent to 38 cents from 47 cents.
There were fewer shares outstanding in the latest quarter and Mr Miller said
that the board had extended the company's share buy-back programme by an
additional Dollars 50m of common stock, bringing the total authorisation to
Dollars 350m.
For the first half, Liz Claiborne earned Dollars 73.8m, or 90 cents, on
sales of Dollars 1.04bn against Dollars 102.3m, or Dollars 1.21, on sales of
Dollars 1.03bn a year earlier. Earnings in the 1993 period included one-time
gains of Dollars 1.6m.

FT  19 JUL 93 / International Company News: Enlarged net fails to make a big
catch - The apathy of small investors to the government's plan for wider
share ownership
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HARDLY a privatisation goes by without a minister talking about Britain's
share owning democracy. The government's third and last sale of BT shares is
no exception.
In the run-up to the trading of the partly paid shares, which starts today,
Mr Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary to the Treasury, frequently cited
the flotation as evidence of the government's commitment to 'widening and
deepening share ownership'.
The government justifies wider share ownership on the basis that it involves
individuals directly in the economic success of UK companies as well as
allowing them to build up security for the future. On that basis, say
government advisers, the retail investors will today be pleased to have
bought their shares and should have the added satisfaction of making a small
profit.
Yet with most of the big privatisations completed the evidence suggests that
the government has failed in its objective.
The government points out that the number of small shareholders has
increased from around 3m in 1979 to peak at 11m in 1991, although it has
recently fallen back to 9.26m, which government advisers blame on the
recession. In percentage terms the proportion of the adult population owning
shares is around 21 per cent compared with just 9 per cent in 1979.
Institutions, however, account for a bigger percentage of shares in
privatised companies than ever before. According to the partly-government
funded ProShare, which tracks share ownership, pension funds and insurance
companies hold more than half of all shares in privatised companies compared
with 20 per cent held by small shareholders.
Mr David Jones, chief executive of ShareLink, the telephone-based
stockbroker which is about to float on the Stock Exchange, says the problem
is of the government's own making. He believes concepts such as 'share
owning democracy' and 'widening and deepening share ownership' are not
sufficiently defined by ministers for the public to know whether they have
succeeded or failed.
His own evidence suggests that retail investors currently have a greater
appetite than ever to buy and sell shares. This is borne out in ShareLink's
pre-tax profits, which rose from Pounds 1m to Pounds 3.1m in the year to
March 31 without any privatisations or big share issues.
It was the privatisations that the government hoped would bring about a
cultural change in share ownership. But there seems to be a reluctance by
investors to go on and buy shares in other companies after taking part in a
privatisation issue. ProShare's figures show that 72 per cent of all retail
investors hold shares in only one or two companies.
The government has sought to rectify this by extending the concept of share
shops first used in the 1991 BT sale. Ministers hope that many retail
investors who buy shares in BT3 will be enticed by their broker, building
society or bank, to buy shares in other companies.
Mr John Cobb, chairman of the Association of Private Client Investment
Managers and Stockbrokers, describes the decision to extend the number of
share shops from eight to around 150 as a 'significant step forward'.
Many of the share shops, however, are less enthusiastic. Mr Tony Vine-Lott,
chief executive of Barclays Stockbrokers, says: 'The share shops have not
been adequately put across by the government or its advisers.' Of the 1.66m
people applying for shares in BT3, 978,000 decided to go through a share
shop as opposed to registering with the Share Information Office.
Where the government has had more success is in its efforts to entice retail
investors to buy shares in a privatisation issue when there is little
possibility of making a big profit on the first day of trading.
Less than 10 per cent of the 1bn shares bought by retail investors in the
last BT sale were sold during the first month of trading. That compares with
more than 35 per cent of shares sold in the regional electricity companies
in the first month of trading.
Mr Neil Stapley, managing director of NatWest Stockbrokers, says the
Treasury's policy of tight pricing has eliminated the possibility of
'stagging', whereby investors only bought shares in privatised companies to
sell on the first day of trading.
The chances of making such a profit on BT have been virtually eliminated by
the government, notwithstanding the retail investors' 10p discount on each
of the three instalments.
The majority of retail investors buying shares are expected to remain
long-term holders of BT. After the initial privatisation of BT in 1984 the
telecommunications company had 2.1m small shareholders. This fell to around
1m four years later. Following the second sale of government shares in 1991
the number of individual shareholders in BT rose to 2.6m. This has recently
fallen to 2.2m.
But the rate of attrition is slow compared to the early privatisations.
British Aerospace, for example, one of the first companies to go public in
1981, attracted 26,000 retail investors, which slumped to just 3,000 soon
after the sale.
This is success of a kind, but it is not what the government hoped for when
it embarked on its wider share-ownership campaign in the eighties.
When all the razzmatazz of today's flotation is over the government still
has to persuade hundreds of thousands of BT shareholders to buy and sell
shares in other companies.
The evidence to date suggests that BT3 will not halt the inexorable slide in
the proportion of individuals owning shares.

FT  19 JUL 93 / International Company News: Bid for William Hill still under
consideration
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BANKS OWED Pounds 350m by the William Hill betting shop chain, owned by
Brent Walker, are still considering a possible Pounds 360m bid from a
consortium of institutional investors put together by SG Warburg.
Sir Keith Bright, chairman of the troubled property and leisure group since
January, is understood to believe William Hill is worth significantly more
than Pounds 360m, and that the bid is not in the interests of all creditor
banks, owed over Pounds 1.3bn.
A sale at that price would require another balance sheet write off for Brent
Walker, and further reduce its chances of servicing other debt.
However, the William Hill banks have a right to pursue the bid and could see
loans repaid in full if it was accepted.
The banks looked at an outline bid at an otherwise routine meeting last
Friday called to discuss options for the refinancing of William Hill, which
must go through by March 1 William Hill's loans are 'ring-fenced' from Brent
Walker.
The Warburg bid, on behalf of investors Mercury Asset Management, Electra,
Morgan Grenfell and Midland Montagu, is far from being finalised.
Under the William Hill loan agreement the company is bound to pursue any
serious offer made. The banks have the right to vote on such an offer. If a
vote goes against a bid, any banks which were in favour of accepting gain a
higher security ranking for their loans than those voting against. This
would effectively make their loans safe.
But a higher sale price - perhaps through a flotation - would generate
surplus cash for Brent Walker. There is a conflict since banks which have
lent to Brent Walker represent 57 per cent of the loans to William Hill.
Therefore, those banks which are in both syndicates could block the bid, but
if they did the other William Hill banks' debt would gain security over
theirs.
Brent Walker's advisers believe a flotation, taking advantage of the current
strength of the new issue market, could raise more for William Hill,
although suggestions of a Pounds 500m value are regarded as 'optimistic' by
some.
Another attraction of a flotation would be that Brent Walker could retain a
stake in William Hill which would be worth more in future years if its
profits recover as expected.

Business Technology Group, which sells and services photocopier and
facsimile machines, vending and communication equipment, is raising Pounds
2.2m net through a 5-for-4 rights issue at 10p per share. On Friday the
shares gained 1p to 16p.
The proceeds will significantly strengthen the financial position, reduce
further the indebtedness, and help the group make acquisitions to expand the
machine base and geographical coverage.
The capital will be reorganised into 5p shares, and up to 26.2m will be on
offer. Apartglobal and Mr Stephen Evans have agreed to underwrite 11m and
15.17m shares respectively. The underwriting arrangements provide that
minimum proceeds will be Pounds 1.1m net.
Despite competitive market conditions and lower photocopier and facsimile
machine sales, the group had traded profitably in 1993. Further cuts in
indebtedness had been achieved.

will equate to a 29.9 per cent shareholding. That could raise up to a
further Pounds 2.4m.
The directors of Arlen have noted the recent movement in the share price -
on Friday it rose 7p to 35p. They say the rights at 21p was agreed against
the background of the quote of 14p when discussions commenced in March until
early May, when the share price began to increase.
Mr Greville Howard, chairman of Fortress, and three of his non-executive
colleagues, will become directors of Arlen.

FT  19 JUL 93 / Microsoft may face court order
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE US Federal Trade Commission is scheduled to convene on Wednesday to
consider the results of a near three-year anti-trust investigation of
Microsoft, the world's largest computer software company.
Investigators from the FTC's bureau of competition are believed to have
recommended that the commission seek a federal court injunction against
Microsoft. They allege that the company has improperly used its monopoly
position in the market for PC operating system software to disadvantage
competitors.
Throughout the investigation, Microsoft has denied any wrongdoing, insisting
that it is 'co-operating fully with the FTC investigation'.
In February, the commission's attempts to make a recommendation reached
deadlock, with two commissioners voting in favour of taking action against
Microsoft, and two voting against. A fifth commissioner, claiming a conflict
of interest, excused himself from the case.
At this week's meeting, the commission will be presented with a much
simplified and narrowed case against Microsoft, according to Ms Wendy
Goldman Rohm, author of a soon-to-be published book called The FTC versus
Microsoft: The inside story.
The revised case focuses on allegations of 'technological tying' of
Microsoft's widely used Windows program to its MS-Dos PC operating system,
according to Ms Goldman Rohm.
Microsoft has been accused by competitors of attempting to raise false
concerns among customers that its Windows program does not work properly
with operating system programs sold by competitors. There are also
complaints that it has linked product warranties to the use of its MS-Dos
operating system.
If the commission reaches deadlock again on the Microsoft case, the US
Justice Department, which also has jurisdiction over anti-trust enforcement,
may take up the matter, Ms Goldman Rohm says. 'There is considerable
political pressure being brought on the commissioners not to just drop the
case.'
Yet even if the revised case against Microsoft is pursued by the FTC, the
outcome could be 'commercially insignificant', Ms Goldman Rohm predicts.
She says the FTC is unlikely to seek 'structural remedies', such as breaking
up Microsoft into two separate companies. Instead, the Commission may simply
issue a 'cease and desist' order against the company.

FT  19 JUL 93 / Investors cool on 'China stock'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE HONG KONG portion of a HKDollars 2.9bn (Pounds 253m) capital raising for
Shanghai Petrochemical, the largest of nine state-owned Chinese companies to
be listed in the colony, was only 1.77 times subscribed.
In Hong Kong, where new issues are usually many times subscribed, local
investor response was seen as disappointing. However, the issue would have
fared worse had not the two issuing houses subscribed for half the shares.
Mr Wang Jiming, chairman of Shanghai Petrochemical, said: 'The Hong Kong
offering would have been subscribed 1.24 times without the applications from
Merrill Lynch and Peregrine Capital.'
Shanghai Petrochemical is offering 1.68bn H shares - 30 per cent of the
company - split equally between Hong Kong and the rest of the world. The
subscription price will be established by a tender in New York. The
company's advisers have set a guide price of between HKDollars 1.55 and
HKDollars 1.74 a share.
Since the company came to the market on July 6 concerns about the Chinese
economy have lessened the appeal of 'China stocks'. Equally important,
investors found the pricing of Shanghai Petrochemical too aggressive.
Most new issues in Hong Kong are floated at six to eight times prospective
earnings - leaving plenty in it for 'stags'. Judging by the guide range,
Shanghai Petrochemical is priced on a prospective p/e of 12.3 to 13.8.
Standard Chartered and Wardley backed out from underwriting the Hong Kong
portion of the issue.
The 'failure' of the Hong Kong float drew sharp criticism of the colony's
financial community by Mr Philip Tose, chairman of Peregrine.
He accused his fellow merchant bankers of not understanding that
underwriting was about accepting risk. He also called for Hong Kong's system
of pricing new issues to follow US practice where tenders are used.
He said the issue was seeing heavy demand internationally, but 'because of
the way it has to be offered in Hong Kong we got the tail wagging the dog.'
Guangzhou Shipyard International, owned by the People's Liberation Army,
plans to list in Hong Kong early next month.

FT  19 JUL 93 / Power lines unleashed from home base: Why UK electricity
companies are venturing abroad
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two and a half years after they were privatised, Britain's electricity
companies are developing ambitions to break out of their home market.
Both the large generation companies, National Power and PowerGen, have
announced projects in places as far apart as India, eastern Germany and the
US. Some of the regional electricity distribution companies are also looking
overseas.
These wider aspirations are understandable given the crowded nature of the
UK power market with its large surplus of generating capacity. But the news
has been received with caution on the stock exchange. Investors are not sure
whether utilities should be chasing business abroad, and they are watching
developments carefully.
Mr John Baker, chief executive of National Power, puts his company's
international case bluntly. NP's share of the UK generation market is being
whittled away by new competitors, such as Nuclear Electric and the
independent power producers, and will probably fall below 40 per cent quite
soon. To achieve growth, NP must either diversify out of electricity, which
it is unwilling to do, or try to sell its electricity expertise in new
markets.
What particularly attracts NP overseas is an estimate by the World Bank that
800,000MW of new electricity capacity - more than 10 times the capacity of
the UK electricity industry - costing Pounds 500bn will have to be built
globally over the next 10 years, much of it in the Third World. NP is
prepared to commit Pounds 1bn to this market, a sum which, geared up as
power projects usually are, could involve it in Pounds 15bn of power
stations.
PowerGen, NP's smaller competitor, is also worried about pressures on the
home front, so it commissioned McKinsey, the management consultants, to
assess its chances overseas. McKinsey identified 350 companies with the
strength to compete in the international power market, and placed PowerGen
among the top 10. This, Mr Ed Wallis, PowerGen's chief executive says,
helped persuade him to pursue opportunities abroad.
Both NP and PowerGen are keen to play down the risks in their strategies.
Mr Graham Hagley, NP's managing director for international business
development, says the company intends to build a mixed portfolio of overseas
investments in which those with high risks and high rewards are balanced by
others which are less exposed financially, but produce lower returns.
NP's recent Dollars 160m acquisition of TEVCO, the owner of seven power
plants in the south eastern US - its largest so far - falls into the second
category, and provides 'ballast' for higher risk ventures in areas such as
the Indian subcontinent and the Far East.
One of these involves NP teaming up with Ashok Leyland of Madras to build a
1,000MW coal-fired station in Andhra Pradesh at a cost of Pounds 1.3bn. 'Our
concept is to hold a significant stake and have long-term operating
responsibility,' says Mr Hagley. NP could contribute expertise both in the
construction and management of the project.
PowerGen is sticking closer to home. Its major projects so far have been in
Portugal, where it is participating in a gas-fired power station, and in
eastern Germany where it is negotiating with other partners to buy a power
station and the nearby coal mine which supplies it.
'We're not running a race,' says Mr Wallis. 'We're being a bit sniffy,
looking for quality investments. We're telling our shareholders that we're
limiting ourselves to activities for which we have the management skills.'
PowerGen is unlikely to go into either the US, which is too competitive, or
India because of the risks, but it is looking at the Asean states and China.
In particular he hopes that cementing PowerGen's links with German partners
will give it a base for expansion into the east European market.
But competition in the international power market has intensified in recent
years. The main players include large US utilities, and manufacturers of
power generating equipment in North America and Europe. Among the UK
electricity distributors, Midlands Electricity has teamed up with Enron, the
Houston-based gas company, and several US utilities in a joint venture
called Wing Merrill International, which is looking at projects in Kuwait,
Turkey and China.
The risks are high. Mr Wallis estimates that 50 per cent of international
power projects fail to get off the ground. People are bamboozled by
over-optimistic profit forecasts, or fail to do their homework properly.
'There are often skeletons in the cupboard,' he says.
Analysts have said that PowerGen's project in Portugal could run into
trouble because the power station was started before the government reached
agreement on how to ship in the gas. But Mr Wallis said the delay on gas was
foreseen and his company is not exposed financially.
One of the precautions that National Power took before embarking on its
Indian project was to secure a guarantee from the Indian government that it
would receive all the payments and dividends due to it.
All of which explains why investors are cautious. Mr Alex Milne, electricity
analyst at Barclays de Zoete Wedd, says that foreign markets are a
'reasonable area' for UK generators to look at, given their technical
expertise and financial strength.
He applauds their measured approach, but in such a new market there is
little way of judging how successful their investments will be. 'You have to
take it on trust that they are not going to shovel a lot of money down a big
black hole'.

FT  19 JUL 93 / T&amp;N cited as latest suitor for Lucas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
T&amp;N, the British motor components and engineering group, is understood to
have approached Lucas Industries to discuss a possible friendly link-up, but
it has been rebuffed by the aerospace and motor components manufacturer.
T&amp;N declined to comment yesterday on suggestions that it was seeking an
agreed merger with Lucas. Mr Mark Herbert, corporate communications manager
at Lucas, described the reports as 'rumour and speculation'.
Takeover speculation concerning Lucas has been rife for some time. Earlier
this year BTR, the industrial group, was strongly rumoured to be interested
in acquiring the company. More recently Siemens, the German engineering and
electronics company, has been cited as the most likely bidder.
A merger of T&amp;N and Lucas would create a group with sales in excess of
Pounds 4bn. T&amp;N is thought to have expanded an original plan which intended
a merger of its brake-linings business with that of Lucas.
Lucas is seen by many in the City as lacking strong management. It has
failed to appoint a new chief executive, despite a lengthy search, and a new
non-executive chairman to succeed Sir Anthony Gill, who is scheduled to step
down in October.
Another demoralising factor has been its poor profits performance. In March
it announced pre-tax profits of Pounds 5.2m on turnover of Pounds 1.29bn for
the six months to the end of January.

FT  19 JUL 93 / Economics Notebook: History lesson on how to raise taxes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The European Community has just woken up to a crisis in its public finances.
EC economics and finance ministers agreed a week ago, that they would have
to take tough action to cut national budget deficits, including possible tax
increases.
The problem is daunting. According to the EC's economic policy committee,
net general borrowing by EC governments has risen steadily to more than 6
per cent of national income this year, compared with 2.7 per cent in 1989.
During the same period, state spending has jumped more than 5 percentage
points to a record 52 per cent of gross domestic product, and the share of
tax and social security contributions has risen by 1.5 points to almost 46
per cent - also a record.
But increasing taxation is no easy matter. No-one likes paying taxes at the
best of times. Moreover, the EC's political leaders are nearly all
unpopular. Higher taxes can easily translate into defeat at the polls.
In this uncertain world, Mr Ken Messere, until 1991 the head of the fiscal
affairs division of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and
Development, has produced a valuable guide on tax policies in the main
western industrial countries.
His Tax Policy in OECD Countries: Choices and Conflict* offers no magic
cure. But drawing on 30 years' experience with tax policy matters and 20
years as the OECD's top tax expert, he provides a mine of information about
where governments have gone wrong and gives valuable clues as to what they
should and should not do.
Mr Messere is no instinctive tax cutter. He can barely conceal his distaste
for the antics of politicians in the 1980s, who (especially in Britain) cut
taxes for ideological reasons and argued that the changes would enhance
economic per-formance.
With the advantage of a long perspective and an erudite approach to taxation
that takes in the observations of Pliny the Younger, St Thomas Aquinas and
the November 1992 Catholic Church Catechism, he takes a dim view of the
happenings of the past 30 years. 'Any watcher of revenue developments can
hardly fail to be struck by the irrationality of countries' tax policies
over most of the period.'
One irrationality, in a supposedly interdependent age, has been the failure
of most OECD governments to pay attention to tax policy changes made by
other governments to solve similar problems.
Another is the way that the total tax ratio, that is the ratio of total tax
revenues to GDP, has fallen in many countries since the mid 1980s without a
corresponding fall in government outlays.
This trend has been accompanied by a generally welcome convergence of
industrial country tax ratios. But great differences remain in the way
governments raise tax revenues.
This is especially true of the four biggest EC member states: Germany,
France, Italy and Britain.
France has the lowest dependency of any major industrial country on revenues
from personal income tax - only 7.5 per cent of GDP in 1990. The reasons
include antiquated collection methods and high thresholds that exempt nearly
half the population from paying tax. Against this, it relies a great deal on
social security contributions.
Germany, which is struggling with huge deficits caused by unification, has
the lowest standard value added tax rate in industrialised Europe at 15 per
cent, and VAT and income tax ratios that are below the European average.
Italy, on Mr Messere's reckoning, has no pronounced tax eccentricity. But
its tax administration is notoriously deficient.
Britain, whose government so prided itself on tax reform in the 1980s, has a
poor tax policy record in Mr Messere's view. It has the narrowest VAT base
in Europe, zero-rating such items as foods, new dwellings, books, children's
clothes and sewerage services.
UK tax policy has been influenced far more than in other states by party
political preferences, because Britain's 'first past the post' electoral
system has given the executive arm of the UK government more power to change
taxes than governments on the continent.
Some consequences for taxation have been bold, innovative and rational: Lord
Lawson's 1984 reform of corporation tax falls in this category.
Others such as the poll tax or the selective employment tax introduced by
Labour in 1966 were simply 'crazy', according to Mr Messere. Nor is he very
enthusiastic about the council tax. He notes that it combines various
features of a property tax, a household tax, a poll tax and an income tax,
'which has never been contemplated by any other OECD country'.
Differing tax structures among EC member states may help explain their
varying economic performance. For example, France's greater dependence on
employers' social security contributions to provide state revenues may be
one reason why French unemployment stayed so high in the 1980s and is now
rising very sharply in recession.
But the differing structures could also present an opportunity to
governments that now must think about raising tax to eliminate deficits.
Peer group example and pressure are already being used to soften up
electorates for potentially painful cuts in welfare spending.
Ironing out differences in tax structures among EC states could provide a
suitable cloak for European governments wishing to boost revenues in the
1990s. Handled carefully, the process could even smooth the competitive
playing field for businesses and individuals, promoting the single market.
Clearly, much would depend on how the additional tax revenues were raised.
Mr Messere points out that it is sensible to diversify sources of increased
tax revenue to reduce taxpayer discontent. This may seem obvious, but it has
been ignored by many governments.

FT  19 JUL 93 / Pakistan appoints caretaker premier as Sharif quits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FARHAN BOKHARI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR MOEEN QURESHI, a former vice-president of the World Bank, was last night
sworn in as Pakistan's caretaker premier after the army arranged a deal
which brought Mr Nawaz Sharif's resignation as prime minister.
Mr Sharif had announced earlier in the evening that he would step down.
President Ghulam Ishaq Khan, who has been locked in a power struggle with Mr
Sharif for the last six months of the latter's 32 months in office, followed
suit shortly after appointing Mr Qureshi and dissolving the national
assembly.
Elections for the lower house of parliament have been set for October 6.
Caretaker governments are expected to be set up in Pakistan's four
provinces, where elections are scheduled for October 9. Mr Wasim Sajjad, the
Senate chairman, took over as acting president in the run-up to presidential
elections.
In an effort to ensure their impartiality, members of the interim government
would almost certainly promise not to contest the election, senior
government officials said.
As well as international experience, Mr Qureshi has the advantage of having
no overt affiliation with any political group, the officials added. His
World Bank credentials are also seen as positive for Pakistan's quest for a
Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m) loan from the International Monetary Fund this
year.
Under the accord arranged by General Abdul Waheed, the army chief of staff,
Mr Khan is to retain his privileges for the four months until his scheduled
retirement. Ms Benazir Bhutto, the opposition leader, has agreed to the
deal, which meets her demand for fresh elections. Mr Sharif had sought to
mend fences with Ms Bhutto but was apparently unwilling to give ground.
There was virtually no progress on withdrawing the corruption charges
against Ms Bhutto, which were filed when her government was sacked in August
1990, and are unlikely ever to be proved in court.

FT  19 JUL 93 / Efim liquidation blocked by EC subsidies dispute: Deadlock
over Pounds 2.93bn for banks and suppliers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM and HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME, MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A BITTER dispute between Italy and the European Commission over state
subsidies is blocking disbursement of L7,000bn (Pounds 2.93bn) earmarked by
the Italian government to pay banks and suppliers owed money by Efim, the
state industrial holding company placed in liquidation last July.
Italian officials maintain that if the matter is not resolved quickly, the
liquidation process risks being undermined and the cost of the operation
increased. Already the eventual cost of liquidating Efim - which controls
about 120 companies ranging from helicopter makers to health spas - is
expected to be as much as L17,000bn. The group has debts of L18,000bn.
Representatives of foreign banks, seeking to recover principal and interest
on L3,500bn, were told bluntly last week at a meeting in Rome with the
Treasury: 'Don't blame us, blame Brussels.' The banks had suspected the
Treasury of using the stance taken by Brussels as an excuse not to pay, but
they now accept the deadlock is genuine.
The matter is all the more embarrassing to the Italian government since the
original liquidation announcement was so badly handled that it affected
Italy's international credit rating.
The banks were not consulted in advance and were initially led to expect a
two-year moratorium with repayment at below market rates of interest on what
amounted to sovereign debt.
The Efim funds have been blocked since April on the grounds that they
constitute a form of unfair aid, albeit retrospective, to state-owned
companies invoking articles 92 and 93 of the Treaty of Rome. EC officials
insist it is a question of Italy conforming to the rules. The Italians have
countered by saying the liquidation process is precisely to prevent the
state from subsidising the Efim group of companies further.
The Treasury also maintains it has a legal obligation to honour the debts
since Efim has been recognised in effect as sovereign risk.
The foreign banks meanwhile are angry at the way Brussels is telling them
that they should have checked more carefully whether the Efim subsidiaries
were unfairly subsidised by the state.
Italian officials believe the liquidation of Efim has been caught up in the
broader conflict between Italy and the EC over state subsidies to industry.
Italy is currently refusing to accept the view of Mr Karel Van Miert, the

FT  19 JUL 93 / Chief constables reject main elements of Sheehy report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S chief constables yesterday resoundingly rejected the central
elements of the government-appointed Sheehy committee's recommendations for
changes in police pay and conditions.
Mr John Burrow, chief constable of Essex and president of the Association of
Chief Police Officers (Acpo), said proposals in the report would damage the
morale and ethos of the police service. The association is seeking immediate
discussions with the government to express its concern.
Mr Michael Howard, home secretary, has until now drawn comfort from the fact
that the chief officers reacted with more reserve than other ranks when the
proposals were published a fortnight ago. But Acpo's formal response now
places all the service's representative organisations in opposition to the
Sheehy report.
The opposition will be expressed forcefully tomorrow evening when more than
11,000 officers are due to gather at Wembley arena in London for a
demonstration organised by the Police Federation, which represents ranks up
to chief inspector, and the Superintendents' Association. Organisers say the
meeting will demonstrate the 'outrage' felt by rank-and-file officers.
Radical proposals in the report, produced by a committee chaired by Sir
Patrick Sheehy, chairman of BAT Industries, include introducing 10-year
fixed-term contracts subsequently renewable every five years,
performance-related pay and lifting the retirement age from 55 to 60.
In its response, Acpo supports fixed-term contracts for senior officers but
not for constables, sergeants and inspectors who make up the majority of
police officers. It also opposes relating junior ranks' pay to performance.
Acpo says the proposed retirement age change, combined with recommendations
on pensions, would prevent mature entrants gaining full pensions. And, say
the chief constables, 'we doubt that the stresses and strains of operational
policing can be effectively carried out by officers approaching their 60s'.
While Acpo wants more flexibility in the management structure, it opposes a
recommendation to abolish the ranks of chief inspector, chief superintendent
and deputy chief constable.
Mr Howard will consider responses to the Sheehy report until September
before making final decisions.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There appears to have been something of a whispering campaign against Lord
Stevens' stewardship of United Newspapers. Given his past involvement with
the Invesco MIM fund management group, he is not one of the City's favourite
figures. But United's trading record over the past few years has been
respectable. There is little reason to let personal considerations cloud
United's Pounds 190m rights issue which closes tomorrow.
The substantive worry concerns what United will do with the money. The
company has not spelt out how it will use the proceeds, apart from reducing
gearing. Shareholders are always suspicious of handing over their cash for
unspecified purposes. United's Pounds 250m acquisition of the disappointing
Extel shows its record is not spotless.
News International's launch of a tabloid price war last week has also
unsettled United's shares. The early indications are that the Daily Star has
been caught up in The Sun's wash but that the Daily Express has been little
affected. It seems unlikely that News International hopes for anything as
crude as knocking the Daily Star out of business. Although the Daily Star
incurs losses it accounts for about 20 per cent of the through-put of
United's printing plants and helps defray overhead costs.
Ironically, United's rights issue, which has been fully underwritten, may
serve as a spoiling action of its own. Institutions flush with United paper
may prove more resistant when Mirror Group Newspapers' administrators come
knocking at the door.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
When the head of Morgan Stanley Asset Management is pictured in a scary bear
costume on the front of a US business magazine, it is clear some investors
are getting worried. With the exception of Japan, most of the world's mature
stock markets have been lacklustre performers this year, though some
European bourses have been a little perkier recently.
Worries over a secular downtrend have spurred a renewed interest in emerging
markets. In Latin America and the Pacific rim, in particular, economic
growth rates remain strong. Moreover, these regions seem likely to increase
their slice of global GDP significantly by the end of the decade.
Fund managers are beginning to juggle their portfolios to reflect the new
reality. Those stock markets showing the best returns in dollar terms in the
first half of 1993 were: Turkey, up 129 per cent; Brazil, up 55 per cent;
and Jordan, up 39 per cent.
Still, it would not do to give up on the old world just yet. There is a
touch of tulip bulb fever about the rise of some emerging markets. Their low
liquidity accentuates their volatility and limits opportunities for
investment on any scale. Nomura Investment Trust alone has some Dollars
360bn of funds under management, worth more than the capitalisation of the
entire Paris bourse. Such funds have little option but to keep the vast bulk
in secure markets in the developed world, where privatisation is likely to
place increasing demands on them.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Just as the market had almost persuaded itself that the Marlboro cigarette
price cuts reflected unique pressures, along comes Procter &amp; Gamble and
attacks detergent prices. P&amp;G's campaign may have the specific intention of
forestalling the rise of private labels in the US. But combined with similar
moves elsewhere from Heinz and BSN, it suggests consumer products
manufacturers are now expending mighty efforts to drive down prices, thereby
reversing the cosy industry trend of the 1980s. Low inflation, slow growth,
intensifying competition and heightened consumer perceptions of value are
squeezing brands' premium prices.
Price deflation has already made life painful in other industries, such as
oil. Such pressures apply not only to manufacturers but also to
distributors. Shareholders in the slipping sands of the UK food retailing
sector may have further reason to question their footing. Decelerating
inflation is reducing profits expectations. The fierceness of the big three
grocers' fight against Costco's planning application for a warehouse club
highlights their worries about lower-margin competitors.
The leading superstore operators suggest gross margins are now levelling out
after many years of successive rises. Given that new stores generate
higher-than-average gross margins, this implies those from existing stores
are already sliding. Earnings and dividend growth from the sector may still
average 8-9 per cent over the next few years. That may seem parsimonious
when compared with the rates of growth in 1980s. The market, though, seems
to be discounting a lot worse.

Lights at the Treasury and SG Warburg doubtless flickered all weekend as the
vendors of BT3 tried to separate the institutional sheep from the
speculative goats in the professional part of the sale. The clustering of
bids around 12p over the market price of BT shares suggests greater
enthusiasm than there was in BT2 when fund managers kept all the interest
saving associated with partly-paid shares. Still, that is more of a
reflection of the outlook for BT and UK equities than the marketing effort.
Overseas investors may simply view BT partly paid shares as a geared play on
the UK market. The increase in allocations to UK retail holders thus looks
odd since institutions were prepared to pay so much more. Given that there
will be little immediate premium for retail stags to sell into, perhaps
Warburg is making the job of stabilising the issue easier by keeping
professional investors hungry.
One troubling aspect of the BT3 saga needs sorting out before the secondary
sale of the power generators next year. The Treasury, determined to get
maximum value for its stake, indulged in a little self-help by twisting the
Stock Exchange's arm over reporting of large trades. There are concerns over
market manipulation around share offers. But that applies equally well to
the government and Warburg making up the rules to suit themselves as it does
to institutions trying to depress the price.
A widely agreed framework for the stabilisation of issues both before and
after flotations is needed. The failure to produce one promptly will leave
the SIB's and the exchange's leaky ship still lower in the water.

FT  19 JUL 93 / A fierce brand of consumer warfare: Procter &amp; Gamble is
slashing costs as the battle for market share intensifies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
You need walk only a few hundred yards from Procter &amp; Gamble's imposing
twin-domed Cincinnati headquarters to appreciate the market forces which
have prompted the consumer products giant to announce its biggest round of
job cuts and factory closures.
In a Walgreens discount drug store in the centre of the Ohio city, a
12-ounce bottle of P&amp;G's bright pink Pepto-Bismol medicine, which treats
stomach upsets, sells for Dollars 5.29. But on the shelf next to it, in
remarkably similar packaging, is a bottle of Walgreens' own-label Soothe at
the enticing price of Dollars 3.99. Lug your shopping basket a few shelves
along and you will find a similar pattern repeated with P&amp;G's Tide laundry
detergent and its Pampers nappies.
Competition from retailers' own private-label goods and cut-price branded
merchandise is causing much discomfort in the US to large household and
personal products manufacturers - P&amp;G, Colgate-Palmolive and Anglo-Dutch
Unilever - at a time when they are locked among themselves in a fierce
battle for market share, both in North America and around the world.
This intensifying competition prompted P&amp;G to announce last week that it
will cut 13,000 jobs, or 12 per cent of its worldwide labour force, over the
next three to four years and close about 30 factories, about 20 per cent of
the total. There will be a Dollars 1.5bn charge to earnings in the year
which ended in June.
The aim is to drive down its costs by Dollars 500m by 1995-96 and give it
the financial flexibility to combat its rivals with price cuts, such as the
aggressive 15 per cent drop in US liquid laundry detergent prices it also
announced last week.
About half the job cuts will come from the closure of factories - some
acquired during a takeover wave in the 1980s - which P&amp;G says have been made
redundant by changing markets and more efficient production methods.
The remainder will stem from a sweeping seven-month review of P&amp;G's work
processes and organisational structure, carried out with the help of
management consultants Booz Allen &amp; Hamilton. This is designed to sharply
cut overhead costs as a percentage of net sales.
The company is cutting out layers of management, increasing the number of
staff for which each executive is responsible and simplifying many
practices, such as equipment buying and customer billing.
P&amp;G is not alone in its efficiency drive. Arch-rival Unilever has been
consolidating its manufacturing operations in recent years, while the much
smaller Colgate-Palmolive took steps two years ago to close nearly one third
of its factories and shed 8 per cent of its workforce.
However, the sheer scale of restructuring at P&amp;G indicates that the battle
for supermarket shelf space will intensify over the next few years,
particularly in the US but also in western Europe.
'I think they are saying that pricing is going to be the key component of
marketing,' says Ms Bonita Austin, an analyst at Lehman Brothers, who
forecasts a squeeze on smaller manufacturers and further consolidation of
the industry.
But the restructuring raises fresh questions about consumers' brand loyalty
and the size of the price premium big manufacturers such as P&amp;G can command
nowadays over cut-price rivals. Investors have been nervous about this since
Philip Morris was forced to cut sharply the price of America's best-selling
Marlboro cigarette earlier this year because of competition from unbranded
rivals.
Still, at least P&amp;G is pushing deeper into the fray from a position of
strength. Over the next few weeks it will announce record 1992-93 profits
(before the Dollars 1.5bn charge) of more than Dollars 2bn, up more than 10
per cent on last year, and its balance sheet is strong.
The cuts, therefore, are not those of a flailing US giant, such as IBM,
which has lost touch with the market-place, but rather a pre-emptive strike
to prevent an erosion of its hold on consumers.
The company, long-known for its toughness, product innovation and a somewhat
secretive, in-bred culture, became even more aggressive in the 1980s, when
mature US markets for its core laundry and household products pushed it into
a two-pronged strategy: rapid global expansion and a push into new sectors
offering faster growth, such as beauty care and over-the-counter medicines.
This, coupled with buoyant global economies, produced extremely strong
earnings growth in the late 1980s. But since 1990, the pace has slowed to an
unspectacular annual average rise of just 9 per cent.
Its international business, which now accounts for more than 50 per cent of
revenues, is still growing strongly, with volume sales up 10 per cent in
1992-93. But profit margins internationally are lower than in the US, which
P&amp;G has been relying on to fund the global push.
Yet the US market has been weak, with P&amp;G's sales volume up just 1 per cent
over the past year, due to recession. This has intensified competition and
the temporary dislocation caused by a radical change in the group's
marketing strategy to a system called 'value pricing'.
Under the old system, P&amp;G ran trade promotions to boost sales, offering big
but periodic discounts to retailers and wholesalers. This was inefficient,
since it encouraged the buyers to stockpile discounted goods and forced P&amp;G
to keep extra manufacturing capacity to handle big swings in demand.
The new system, introduced on 70 per cent of P&amp;G's US products over the past
two years, cuts trade promotions and uses the savings to ensure lower prices
throughout the year. The change has angered some retailers, who relied on
the promotions for a good part of their profits, rather than passing them on
to consumers; as a result P&amp;G's market share initially suffered.
However, the company insists that both its volumes and market share have
begun recovering during the past six to nine months and that its 'value
pricing' brands are performing significantly better than those on the old
system.
P&amp;G claims to have blunted the threat from private-label and cheap branded
goods, which it reckons controlled 21 per cent of US markets in which it
competes in the first half of this year, up just 1 per cent from a year ago.
Mr Edwin Artzt, P&amp;G's chairman since 1990, argues that the recent concern
over consumers' brand loyalty is exaggerated. Private-label goods, he says,
have been around for a long time and will tend to gain share in a recession,
when consumers are more price conscious, and lose it during a recovery.
However, no one really knows whether this is so in the 1990s, or whether
there has been a fundamental shift of attitude among cost-conscious western
consumers in favour of own-label.
Still, it is hard to argue with his second proposition: that the challenge
for branded consumer products companies is to ensure that the premium they
charge accurately reflects consumers' perceptions of the superior quality of
their goods.
Marlboro's price, which was nearly double that of cheap generic brands
before the recent cuts, had got out of line with the market. P&amp;G, Mr Artzt
says, does not intend to do the same.
Consumer perceptions depend not only on price but also advertising, which,
P&amp;G says, it plans to increase (on top of a 5 per cent worldwide rise last
year), and on product innovation. Here the company's recent record has been
mixed. Its strength is demonstrated by the way it has turned an obscure
shampoo called Pantene into the world's top-selling brand in just three
years. However, it has recently lagged Kimberly-Clark in new products in
P&amp;G's most important single revenue generating segment, disposable nappies.
The impact of all this on P&amp;G's profits will depend on just how much of the
Dollars 500m cost-savings it has to throw into the price war. Mr Artzt,
while careful to avoid predictions, says that 'we fully expect our growth
rate to increase'.
Some Wall Street analysts are inclined to accept that. However, there are
sceptics such as Mr Gabriel Lowy of Oppenheimer &amp; Co, who says P&amp;G's
earnings growth will remain at about 9 per cent, which he estimates is its
annual average over the past 45 years. In other words, respectable, but
hardly exciting.
But whoever is proved right, the only clear winner in this war is likely to
be the consumer.

FT  19 JUL 93 / Leading Article: The cost of nuclear power
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT will shortly announce the terms of reference for this
autumn's review of UK nuclear power industry. This is an important moment
for energy policy because it will determine whether Britain advances further
down the nuclear route, whether it pauses or even retreats. At the moment,
only one nuclear station, Sizewell B, is being built, and no others have
been authorised. Many first-generation nuclear reactors will reach the end
of their lives during the 1990s, and decisions will have to be taken soon if
they are to be replaced.
The indication from the Department of Trade and Industry is that the review
will focus narrowly on the economics of nuclear power. This is partly
because last winter's coal crisis aired many of the wider issues in
Britain's energy debate, such as the need for a more active energy policy
(answer, no), and the diversity of Britain's energy supplies (which was
found to be adequate). Furthermore, only one question needs answering, and
that is whether the future development of nuclear power can be financed by
the private sector, since the government has no intention of doing it.
This makes a refreshing change from the approach of earlier governments
which handed huge subsidies to the nuclear industry for a variety of
ill-founded reasons, and landed the electricity consumer with large bills
which are still being paid.
Commercially financed
But much will depend on how the question is asked. If the government is only
interested in whether the City would put up Pounds 3bn to build Sizewell C
tomorrow, the review will be a waste of time since the answer is clearly No.
Only three years ago the nuclear sector had to be cut out of the electricity
privatisation programme because investors would not buy it. The situation is
not much different today. Nuclear Electric and Scottish Nuclear, the two
state-owned utilities which own most of the nuclear power stations in
Britain, have made headway in reducing their costs. But nuclear power is
still a long way from the point of being commercially financed.
The more interesting question is whether the economics of the nuclear
industry reflect the full costs and benefits of running nuclear power
stations, including external environmental costs, and if not, how these
should be factored into the calculations so that a better judgment can be
made.
Decommissioning costs
For example, the City's uncertainty about nuclear centres largely on the
question of decommissioning costs - for which there are few reliable
calculations - and waste disposal. The review must get to grips with these
numbers and come up with fuller answers than were produced by the recent
National Audit Office report. It also needs to unravel the economics of
waste disposal, including Thorp, the nuclear reprocessing plant, whose costs
have a strong bearing on the performance of the nuclear operating companies.
By the same token, the review should consider the environmental advantages
offered by nuclear power, which does not emit carbon dioxide or sulphurous
gases. Given the UK's international commitments to clean up its atmosphere,
this is a measurable benefit: the more nuclear power stations, the less need
to invest in a costly clean-up of conventional stations. However this
advantage does not currently help nuclear's commercial case because it is
not reflected in the cost structure of nuclear projects.
This is not a reason in itself for invoking the national interest yet again
on nuclear's behalf. But it does point to the need for a more thoughtful way
of calculating environmental benefits and factoring them into the
appropriate accounts.
Britain has a surplus of generating capacity and an abundant supply of
energy sources, not least of gas, which combines nuclear's advantages on air
pollution with lower cost. At present, it is as clear as it can be that
there is no commercial case for building additional nuclear power stations
in Britain, but hydrocarbon prices will rise at some point and when they do,
rigorous costings of the nuclear option need to be available. That should be
the goal of the nuclear review.

From cramming the lines to clearing the air. Squeamishly capitalist
Californian long-distance telephone company Working Assets - which has
regularly offered its subscribers free calls to Hillary Clinton and other US
eminences to lobby for causes such as nationalised healthcare - has hit on
another do-gooding dodge.
This time its target is the permits the Environmental Protection Agency
issues to electrical utility companies setting a specific limit, according
to their size, on the amount of sulphur dioxide each may emit into the
atmosphere.
Although intended to control the total amount of the emissions, the permits
are marketable. A holder that manages to make do with less than its quota
can sell the short-fall portion to another which wants to belch out more.
So Working Assets is proposing to put a percentage of the bills paid by its
subscribers into a fund to buy up the unused permits, and take them out of
circulation altogether.
'If you want to do something to reduce pollution, this is probably the
easiest and most direct thing you can do,' says owner-president Pete Barnes.
'Every dollar keeps about 10 pounds of sulphur dioxide out of the air.'
Well, maybe - unless the agency resorts to the printing press and issues new
permits to fill up the space the company has cleared.

No, according to a survey of 130 headhunters by the Executive Grapevine

So how about their own backgrounds: what sort of schools did they go to, for

As the tall ships headed down the Tyne this weekend to race to Bergen, they
passed a send-off party thrown by a company claiming to be the only one that
plied its trade by sail from Newcastle which is still operating there.
Mind you, it very nearly wasn't, admitted Cookson Group's American chief
executive Richard Oster, recalling 1990 when the industrially-diversifed
caboodle almost sank. Nor does he ascribe its recovery primarily to the new
managers who have taken the helm.
When they decided to go for a one-for-four rights issue earlier in the year,
he confided, they were a bit anxious about the outcome of an already
arranged shareholders' visit to the plant of their Vesuvius ceramics
subsidiary at Newmilns near Glasgow.
They became more anxious still when not only did institutional investors and
others representing more than half of the stock ownership turn up, but
Vesuvius's UK chief Roger Brook blithely informed the visitors that nobody
from management would be showing them round the plant. Instead they were
divided into small groups and given a tour by shopfloor workers.
The moral was plain, Oster said. The rights issue was 96.3 per cent taken
up, and the rest of the shares readily sold. 'The workers did a better job
than the likes of me could have done,' added Brook.

The bad news for investors in the business sector just reviewed by London
securities house BZW is that not only the short-run but the medium-term
prospects look 'bleak'. The relevant figures show that 1993 'commenced at a
disappointing rate', mourns BZW's report Where Now? And the trend is
unlikely to improve until the next century, although it is set to peak
around 2030.
The good news for the rest of us in the meantime is that the figures in
question are mortality statistics and the sector is the funeral directing
business.

FT  19 JUL 93 / Observer: Doctor abroad
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
One of life's joys that ended with Margaret Thatcher's premiership was that
of asking Oxford dons whether they yet knew how the Iron Lady was going to
punish them for publicly denying her an honorary doctorate. After all, given
her character, they could not feel safe from retribution until she was
deposed nearly six years later.
But any resentment she may harbour will probably be dispelled this week. For
what her own alma mater denied her in early 1985 will be granted her in
Moscow on Thursday by the Mendeleev University, one of the former Soviet
Union's top research institutes.
She will combine the ceremony with a visit to someone else with cause to
smile ruefully at St Matthew's reminder about prophets being not without
honour save in their own country: ex-president Mikhail Gorbachev.
As Lady Thatcher did at Oxford, the Mendeleev specialises in chemistry.
Moreover, of the mere half dozen foreigners it has granted honorary degrees,
she is the only one who gave up chemistry for other things.
Why the award - did the Oxford snub have anything to do with it? 'I've heard
about that, but it doesn't touch on our decision,' says Dean Pavel Sarkisov.
'We have our own reasons.
'First, she was a chemist by education . . . second, she was a minister of
science and education . . . and third, and most important, she did so much
to advance and develop democracy in this country.'

FT  19 JUL 93 / Leading Article: Japanese confusion
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE JAPANESE election result contains no big surprises, at least for those
who have followed recent opinion polls. The Liberal Democratic party which
has governed the country since 1955 has lost its overall majority, but
remains easily the largest party. In fact its relative dominance has been
increased by the collapse of the Social Democratic party, hitherto the main
opposition. The three new parties advocating political reform have done well
 -especially Mr Tsutomu Hata's Japan Renewal party - but their success has
been gained more at the SDP's expense than at the government's. Clearly the
SDP's themes and style, essentially those of the old left, no longer seem
relevant to those Japanese voters who are keenest for political change.
The short-term outcome will almost certainly be a coalition led by the LDP
and including one or more of the new parties. But it may take weeks to
emerge, as there is bound to be intense bargaining over both policies and
cabinet posts. Meanwhile Japan has reported a big increase in its trade
surplus during the first half of this year. A period of political
uncertainty at this point will be irritating to its trading partners, since
Japan will presumably lack a government with the authority either to make
new trade agreements or to pre-empt foreign pressure with measures to boost
domestic demand such as cuts in income tax and in interest rates - which
would be far preferable to agreements on specific imports.
Balance of power
But even that consequence is not certain. During the election campaign the
outgoing Miyazawa government, generally perceived as a discredited lame
duck, defied conventional wisdom by reaching both multi- and bi-lateral
trade agreements. One of the biggest problems for outsiders dealing with
Japan is, precisely, to discern where power really lies. The present system
neither reflects the real relationship between different centres of power,
nor gives effective voice to the changing balance of sentiments and
aspirations among the population. The election campaign, including that of
the reformers, illustrated all too clearly how opaque and idiosyncratic
Japan's political style remains. Consequently one of the main hopes from any
reform must be that it will bring greater transparency, as well as greater
decisiveness.
A more transparently run Japan would be easier to understand and to do
business with. A more decisively run Japan would be better equipped to deal
with the structural blemishes on its economy, and to confront the external
challenges the country now faces: the changing relationship with a US which
may not be so committed to holding the security ring in Asia for ever; the
evolving foreign and defence policy challenges in Asia itself; and the
pressure for Japan to match its economic power with a stronger international
role.
Political division
The question is what bearing the election result has on all this. The heavy
socialist losses and the success of the new pro-reform parties do at least
suggest that the old left-right divide in politics is being replaced by a
new fault line between conservatives and modernisers. But that will not
quickly, or perhaps ever, be reflected in a clear-cut division between
political parties. Not all the conservatives are in the LDP, and by no means
all the reformers are in the new parties. Indeed, perhaps the greatest
danger to the interests of reform lies in the possibility that the LDP's
electoral performance - in all the circumstances a remarkably resilient one
 -might strengthen the hand of conservatives within the party. And a
resumption of faster growth could easily boost support for the LDP again,
thus leaving in place the cosy bureaucracy/business condominium which has
ruled Japan since the 1950s.
One effect of this would probably be further defections from the LDP, in the
midst of a bitter argument about electoral reform. The parallel with recent
events in Italy is obvious, and not necessarily encouraging. Indeed, in one
respect Japan has moved closer to the pre-reform Italian situation: its
dominant party will now be racked not only by internal faction-fights but
also by constant wrangling with coalition partners.
At best, Japan will gradually conjure from this confusion a more efficient
and more genuinely representative political system. But it will hardly do so
quickly, and maybe not at all.

FT  19 JUL 93 / Personal View: Reluctant banker run to ground
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VACLAV KLAUS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Jacques Attali, the object of recent excessive world media attention, has
resigned from his prestigious post of president of the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development. As I was involved from the outset in January
1990 in the discussions on the establishment of the bank and the selection
of its first president, I would now, with hindsight, like to say a few
words.
Mr Attali has never been a banker in the true sense of the word. He has
never worked in a bank. He was a typical French intellectual (that is, a
socialist intellectual, visibly on the left of the political spectrum), a
writer publishing a book every year and an adviser to President Francois
Mitterrand of France. He was not a conven-tional person and he certainly
never wanted to play a conventional role.
Mr Attali never intended to become a banker. He wanted to be a politician
who could influence the world around him and developments in Europe in
particular.
The wholesale fall of communism in 1989 and the ambitions of the French to
play a new role in Europe gave him the right opportunity. The entire world
was - at least in theory - prepared to do something for the post-communist
countries.
To this end the EBRD was founded - without much enthusiasm from bankers,
economists and financiers - as a purely political undertaking, pushed
through by the European Community, which has a majority shareholding in the
bank.
From the beginning there were arguments over the EBRD's role. Should it
offer the 'usual' loans, perhaps a little more cheaply for individual
projects? Or should it co-operate with countries and governments and
undertake regional planning studies (which I favoured) as a prelude to
restructuring whole branches or sectors?
There was also dissent about its location: should it be in the centre of the
world's financial markets in London; or should it be based in eastern
Europe, where its work would be directed?
And there were questions, among other matters, about its president: should
he be a politician like Mr Attali or a conventional banker? As usual,
compromise won the day and a 'half measure' - an institution with inbuilt
tensions - was born.
At the inaugural meeting of the EBRD in London in April 1991, I disrupted
the prevailing friendly atmosphere when I openly criticised the concept of
the institution; and a photograph of me with Mr Attali was published on the
front pages of newspapers around the world. Asked what I thought of the
bank, I answered that it was 'just another bank'.
This upset Mr Attali because he saw (and wanted to see) the EBRD as
something totally unconventional, something that would - according to the
French left - influence the transformation of east Europe: but from
communism to what? And this is the crux of the whole problem.
We in the east aim to return to the normal democratic system of
parliamentary pluralism and unrestricted market economics. The French left
was aiming for a mixed system with wide-ranging state intervention, with
pseudo-humanistic views (masking the pride of intellectuals and their
insatiable ambitions to recreate the world according to their own ideals) in
an attempt to create a 'just' world.
From all of this, it is clear to me that Mr Attali's extravagant behaviour
(the famous chef brought to London from Paris, private flights in the style
of a head of state, the now well-known marble at the EBRD headquarters in
the City of London) are only snippets of a much greater and more widespread
problem: that of the attitude of the west towards the east after the velvet
revolutions in 1989.
The EBRD, as the only dedicated institution set up at the time with the
specific role of 'helping' the east, has become the victim of an unclear and
hazy 'west-east' set-up. Out of this emerged all the craven preconceptions,
partial or direct lobbying interests, false expectations, and lack of
courage and of a clear vision of the problems involved which, every day, we
experience around us.
Mr Attali was the most obvious, best known, most discernible protagonist of
this historic epoch. He carried out his role with more than a small amount
of charm and graciousness, neglecting trivia (he was above trivia).
With his departure, an era will end. In a certain way I liked him, and to
this day wear the tie in his inimitable taste which he gave me. But only the
choice of his successor will show whether we have really made any progress.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN DAVIDSON

<TEXT>
People are starting to speak about the tragedy of Bosnia in the past tense.
They express outrage or resignation, compassion or contempt, but they speak
as if it were all virtually over. Europe failed, they say; the United
Nations failed; the Vance-Owen plan is dead; the Serbs have won. It is
terrible for them, and shameful for us.
They imply that the Serb military victory - or the joint Serb-Croat victory
and the consequent territorial carve-up of Bosnia - is leading to a
settlement of the conflict. Not the peaceful diplomatic settlement hoped for
from the London conference; nor the consensual settlement laid out in the
bizarre Vance-Owen plan. Instead, it is a bloody, messy and unfair
settlement, they say. But all wars come to an end eventually, and the end of
this war will at least be a settlement of sorts.
This line of thinking is mistaken. The Serbs may be winning a territorial
victory. But we have no reason to suppose it will produce an end to the
conflict. Even if an agreement is signed, there will be no basis for peace,
and one way or another fighting will continue.
This is because the Serbs' nationalistic objectives are designed to exclude
any chance of peace. The atrocities which have been committed in the name of
an atavistic national crusade, the slaughter inflicted on so many tens of
thousands, cannot fail to provoke bloody acts of revenge for years to come.
There is an axiom which states that you should never drive too hard a
bargain because it will simply not be kept by the other side. This is
exactly the kind of bargain which the Serbs seem to be trying to drive: a
carve-up which would not just be unfair to the Moslems, but would give them
a mini-territory which was vulnerable, cut off and unviable.
Together these moral and strategic flaws produce an inflammable mixture. It
will be made more explosive by the mass of homeless refugees. About 3.8m
people have been displaced by the war. The US State Department calculates
that a complete ethnic carve-up of Bosnia would require the resettlement of
1.5m-2m people. Evidence from the partition of India and Pakistan in 1947,
suggests that such vast transfers of population cannot take place without
massive violence.
In any event, many hundreds of thousands will remain homeless refugees. Many
will simply submit. But some of those whose fate is destitution will seek
revenge. That means terrorism.
In the Middle East, the Israelis have saddled themselves with a problem they
cannot solve. This is because they will not make peace with the Palestinians
inside Israel; nor will they make peace with the Palestinians outside
Israel. Since the Palestinians refuse to disappear, there is a continuous
low-level conflict. It is hard to believe that the Serbs are deliberately
setting out to imitate the Israelis, but that is the way it looks.
Some people will shrug their shoulders. We tried to mediate, they will say;
we offered a peace process, but we failed. If they want to go on killing
each other, it's their funeral. It's not our problem.*
But it is our problem, for at least three reasons: refugees, international
recognition and the role of the United Nations.
European Community policy is to keep out asylum-seekers, by sending them
back to the first 'safe' country they pass through. Since all the
Community's neighbours are now designated 'safe' countries, this means that
the Community expects Switzerland, Austria, the Czech Republic, Poland and
others to deal with Europe's refugee problem. The idea that the Community
can shuffle off Europe's vast and growing refugee problem on to smaller and
weaker countries is politically unsustain-able.
In any case, such a policy will not work. If a significant proportion of the
3.8m displaced persons from the former Yugoslavia tries to get into the
Community, many will certainly succeed, legally or illegally, because the
pressures will be irresistible. The war in the former Yugoslavia inevitably
has consequences for us. We recoiled from the costs of intervening, so we
shall have to bear the costs of not intervening.
But suppose the Serbs do cut a deal with the Croats and the Moslems, what
then? We shall have to decide whether to recognise their 'settlement'. If we
do, we may have to insist on policing it, to minimise its injustices and the
risks of further war. If we don't, presumably we have to continue sanctions
against Serbia. But to what end, and on what cond-itions?
The dilemma is unavoidable. If we were unable to influence the war when it
was going on, can we really pretend to influence the results when it is
over?
And yet, how can we possibly endorse the Serbs' war of conquest? How can we
even allow them to remain in the UN, when they have flagrantly offended,
both against the organisation and against its basic principles?
And so to the UN. Experts debate whether the international community really
can claim a new 'right of interference', overriding national sovereignty in
the name of higher values.
The political facts, as seen in Bosnia and Somalia, are three-fold: no
nation state, from Italy to the US, is prepared to submit to UN authority;
every interventionist has a different policy; and none of them has an
interventionist policy worth tuppence. The rest is just legalistic
scratching.

FT  19 JUL 93 / Monday Interview: Dreams that circle the globe: Bob Allen,
the chairman of AT&amp;T, speaks to Andrew Adonis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As the scourge of Europe's state telecommunications monopolies, Bob Allen
comes as a bit of a shock. The chairman of American Telephone and Telegraph,
the US telecoms giant banging at Europe's door, is mild-mannered to the
point of diffidence, disarmingly quick to admit past mistakes and present
ignorance.
However, fresh from an interview with the European Commission's Jacques
Delors - 'President Delors', he calls him - there was nothing coy about Mr
Allen's presence in Brussels, and his subsequent trip to Berlin last week.
'Europe is an important place for us. We have a lot of investment here . . .
If the protective barriers come down, the opportunities will be great.'
Since taking the helm at AT&amp;T in 1988, 'going global' has been one of Mr
Allen's chief ambitions. Whatever its impact on competition overseas, the
strategy is transforming AT&amp;T. Ten years ago, the company had only 60
employees outside the US; now it has 30,000. For Mr Allen, who spent the
formative years of his career working his way up Indiana's Bell company, the
challenge is as much personal as corporate.
The biggest barrier to European telecommunications competition looks set to
fall by 1998, when basic voice telephony will be opened up in most EC
states. But AT&amp;T is not waiting five years to make its pitch. As an
equipment supplier, it is already competing strongly in the liberalised
equipment market. It has an application pending to become a public operator
in the UK. And its ambitious 'Worldsource' venture, which aims to provide an
integrated global telecommunications platform for multinationals, is
scouring Europe for suitable local partners for its launch on the continent
next year.
The backdrop to AT&amp;T's global ambitions is bitter competition in its
long-dis-tance market at home. But, insists Mr Allen: 'We are not driven
solely by competition in our home market to go elsewhere . . . What causes
us to look outside the US and to globalise our business is the huge
investments required, particularly in information technology, to stay on the
leading edge. If we can't spread those investments over a larger base, then
there just isn't enough growth capacity in the US (to do so).
'The fundamental heart of our strategy resides in our global network.' In
Europe 'we would tend towards the partner route', rather than towards taking
equity stakes in existing operators'.
Although in public Europe's leading operators criticise 'unfair' US
competition, there is no shortage of private enthusiasm to become one of
AT&amp;T's Worldsource partners. The fear is about direct competition with AT&amp;T
at home - many allege that AT&amp;T's capacity to shift costs between its
divisions will allow it to pick off the most lucrative parts of their
business one by one.
Mr Allen's response? 'It is impossible to cross-subsidise one business to
another when all of your markets are competitive - well, it's not impossible
. . . but you may lose your life in doing so. The competitive discipline in
all our businesses makes it impossible.' He points to AT&amp;T's 25 business
units: 'If you think any of them are willing to subsidise another business
or part of it, then you don't know how motivated they are to be successful.
I defy anybody to come in and get into our innermost books and find
cross-subsidy.'
Might AT&amp;T agree to formal accounting separation between its divisions, on a
similar basis to that proposed for BT by Oftel, the UK's telecommunications
regulator? 'We do that today, though we don't report it publicly in all
quarters.'
Mr Allen has little time for his regulator back home, the Federal
Communications Commission. 'I find it hard to believe that, with four major
competitors to AT&amp;T in the US, we need much regulation.' The FCC could, he
says, 'virtually fall away' if its staff 'weren't so interested in
protecting their own jobs'.
Mr Allen is adamant that in Europe regulation is needed to break the market
open. At what level of competition should the regulator wither away? 'You
need to look at more than gross market share (gained by competitors); you
need to look at market segments' - but he will not offer figures for either.
That Europe needs AT&amp;T, Mr Allen has no doubt. 'As a general rule, the
development of telecommunications (in Europe) is trailing the US . . . and
therein lies one of the challenges for the unification of the European
Community. Europe needs a telecommunications infrastructure that is uniform
and modern . . . and it probably will not have such while it has protected
industries.'
What of the strategic importance of national telecommunications networks?
'It's essentially an arrogant approach for a government official to say: 'I
know better how to manage the telecoms system and to protect its strategic
value' than to let the marketplace dictate improvement in this strategic
asset.' He applies that to Vice-President Al Gore's dreams of a fibre-optic
communications 'super highway' across the US. 'Not for a moment do I want
them (the Clinton administration) to . . . do anything other than stand
outside and display a vision and support for improvement of the network.'
With its imminent purchase of a stake in McCaw, the US cellular company,
speculation is rife as to AT&amp;T's intentions to enter local
telecommunications in the US, from which it was barred at the break-up of
the Bell structure in 1984.
Mr Allen claims the notion is based on a 'misconception' of the role of
cellular communications. Rather, he cannot understand why US local operators
 -the so-called 'RBOCs' - are so anxious to compete in AT&amp;T's long-distance
market: '99 per cent of our access payments last year went to the RBOCs; 25
per cent of their revenues, and in some cases all of their profits came from
us . . . One wonders why they want to destroy such a good business and get
into the other 60 per cent of the market . . . stimulating competition (in
their market) and see their margins and profits disappear.'
However, with new technology and the development of multi-media - the
convergence of computing, telecoms and the entertainment industry - the
enforced division of the US market between operators is looking
anachronistic. Mr Allen, who barely uses the word 'telephone' these days, is
positioning AT&amp;T as the linchpin of new alliances to bring new products to
market. 'It is our intent to make the network adaptable and usable to all
forms of media.
'It is entirely conceivable we could offer 'data warehouses' for a variety
of companies offering multi-media services,' he says. 'We would do the
billing, servicing the account, for, say, MGN, Library of Congress, and so
on. That's not necessarily our vision,' he adds hastily: 'we have our own
debates about whether we should merely be a distributor or whether we should
own the content; we don't know anything about making movies, but we do know
something about delivering them.'
Multi-media, however, is tomorrow's world: in the shorter term, AT&amp;T sees
China as perhaps its biggest growth prospect. Like all equipment suppliers
and operators, Mr Allen is daunted by the Olympian scale of the Chinese
market. Earlier this year AT&amp;T signed a memorandum of understanding which it
hopes will lead to orders and joint ventures. 'There are sure going to be
bumps on the road; but we are going to try and see it through.
'One of the dreams here,' he says of AT&amp;T's Chinese exploits, 'is that we
have an opportunity to bring new levels of information-sharing that few
other countries have. It's not something I talk about much,' he adds,
'because shareholders want returns, customers want to be served, but when
you step away from the daily grind . . . it does give you a sense of purpose
with a higher ideal than returns.'
So AT&amp;T is the west's Trojan horse in China. It remains to be seen whether
Europe is as receptive to Mr Allen's offerings.

coming. Perplexed that the plan's approval ratings have plunged since its
unveiling in February, they are urging officials to ignore the details and
simply proclaim the good news that a courageous president is at last taking
tough fiscal decisions. But are the cries of hallelujah justified or is
Clintonomics one of those phoney religions that will not deliver on its
promises?
As congressional leaders begin haggling over the final shape of the plan,
the first illusion to dispel is that it offers change in any meaningful
sense. The one novel element in the original plan was the broad-based tax on
energy that was slated to raise Dollars 70bn over five years. This was
hardly onerous, as it represented an annual tax equivalent to only about 0.2
per cent of gross domestic product or about a fortieth of total federal tax
receipts. Yet it proved too much for senators from energy states who
substituted a feeble 4.3 cents per gallon fuels tax that would raise only
Dollars 20bn.
Hopes of introducing a serious energy tax have now all but evaporated. The
Senate's fuels tax is regarded as the outer envelope of what is politically
possible and many Democrats would prefer no tax on energy at all. That way,
the argument runs, Mr Clinton could send a clear message to the electorate:
that he is raising taxes only on corporations and the wealthy and thus is
sticking by his campaign pledge not to impose new taxes on the bulk of
'middle income' families.
Scaling back or dropping the energy tax leaves a hole in the Clinton plan
because negotiators from the House of Representatives are determined to
reinstate measures favouring poor families, such as tax-favoured urban
'empowerment' zones, that were axed by the Senate in June. Yet the dispute,
while serious, is a second-order issue. The crucial point is that the
Clinton plan was never a sharp break from the past.
The Dollars 500bn in deficit 'cuts' over five years sound impressive only
because they are measured relative to a steeply rising 'baseline' that
assumes programmes are automatically adjusted for inflation, growth of
client populations and so forth. On White House projections, the structural
deficit - the deficit adjusted for the economic cycle - will be about 3 per
cent of GDP in 1998, roughly the same as in the late 1980s. Over the next
five years the federal debt is set to rise by another Dollars 1.2bn - hardly
an exercise in austerity.
Allowing for inflation, the package is roughly the same size as Republican
efforts at fiscal consolidation, such as President George Bush's much
maligned 1990 budget accord with Congress and the original 1985 Gramm-Rudman
deficit reduction act. Indeed, the impact of the Clinton plan in the first
two years (which is all that really matters since such deals are always
renegotiated as economic conditions change) is similar to that of the Bush
plan. Neither control non-defence expenditure: the expected annual increases
are 7 per cent under Clinton as opposed to 9 per cent under Bush. They raise
similar amounts of revenue, the main difference being that half of the new
Bush taxes were garnered from a broad increase in excise taxes.
To transform the budget outlook, Mr Clinton needs either to impose an
effective curb on the growth of 'entitlement' spending or to raise taxes
substantially on all sections of the population. He is not willing to do
either. Even if the healthcare reform due in September is relatively bold,
Congress is likely to baulk at measures that really bite, such as rationing
of high-tech equipment. Nobody expects serious cuts in federal pensions, the
other big entitlement programme.
On the revenue side, Mr Clinton is dangerously reliant on tax increases on
the 1 per cent or so of families with incomes of Dollars 200,000 or more. If
the energy tax disappears, up to three-quarters of the increase in federal
revenue may be sought from the wealthy. The plan is to raise taxes on the
rich by about a fifth over five years while holding increases on other
income classes to 2 per cent or less. This is seen as a just retribution for
the greedy 1980s, when the rich gained at the expense of the rest of
society.
In fact, deep cuts in top marginal tax rates under President Ronald Reagan
were associated with a sharp increase in the share of federal taxes paid by
the rich. Since the increase in the top rate from 28 per cent to 31 per cent
in 1990, tax receipts from the wealthy have fallen in absolute terms. Like
it or not, the rich will always enjoy considerable discretion over how hard
they work and, more important, how much of their income they declare for tax
purposes.
There can be no certainty that jacking up marginal tax rates from 31 per
cent to 40 per cent or more will raise large additional sums from this
fiscally-sophisticated group. In this respect, the Clinton plan is even less
plausible than previous Republican attempts to reduce the deficit. If the
economy strengthens markedly in the next two years, the deficit could fall
faster than expected for cyclical reasons. But it would be a temporary
reprieve as nothing has yet been done to correct the adverse longer-term
trends. The hallelujahs are premature.

FT  19 JUL 93 / Foreign Exchange and Money Markets: M3 in focus
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHANIE FLANDERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS likely to be another tense week in European currency markets as
speculators look for signs of weakness in the ERM's defences, writes
Stephanie Flanders.
Their first opportunity may be the June figures for German money growth, due
out early this week, and the provisional figures for the German cost of
living index, which may be released on Friday, or early next week. Both will
have a bearing on whether the Bundesbank thinks it can cut official rates at
its July 29 council meeting, something which some dealers believe the ERM
needs if it is to survive.
Dealers will be trying to gauge the Bundesbank's commitment to support the
French franc and the Danish krone. Some market participants think that the
Danish government could be forced to devalue, even if the franc-D-Mark
parity survives.
Denmark's determination to resist speculators could cause problems for its
economy. The country is in recession while its year-on-year inflation rate
has fallen to 0.9 per cent. However, the Danish National Bank is raising its
key deposit and discount rates to 9.25 per cent from 7.25 per cent to give
the currency extra support.
Another possible victim of speculative pressure is the Belgian franc, which
could join the Spanish peseta and Portuguese escudo on the ERM's
'speculative fringe'.
Meanwhile, events in Europe could distract attention from Japan, where
yesterday's election result will have done little to banish the political
instability which has been casting a shadow over the yen.
Once again, the beneficiaries of Japanese and European uncertainty are
likely to be the Swiss franc, the dollar, and sterling. Neither Britain nor
the US has data out this week which is likely to change the muted
bullishness of recent weeks, although the chairman of the Federal Reserve's
annual testimony before Congress tomorrow and Thursday will doubtless
trigger theorising about future US interest rate movements.

FT  19 JUL 93 / Risk and Reward: How money purchase schemes could be made
more attractive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In a classic final salary-defined benefit scheme, the employer underwrites
the investment risk. But in a money purchase scheme, where the value of the
final benefit depends on how markets behave, the individual bears the risk.
However, if there were a technique to limit the risks the individual has to
bear, might money purchase schemes appear more attractive? Most techniques
on the market involve the gradual shift out of high-yielding but risky
equities into lower risk, lower yielding fixed-interest investments as an
individual approaches retirement.
But investment managers, sensing the commercial opportunities to be
exploited, have been hard at work looking for ways to offer money purchase
schemes with the rewards of equity investment combined with some guarantee
of the final level of benefit to be delivered.
SG Warburg says it has found a way to address the problem with a new product
designed for group money purchase schemes with a minimum of Pounds 500,000
to invest. Warburg concedes that its guarantee is incapable of ensuring that
individuals will earn a benefit which bears any relationship to salary.
After all, even if a lump sum could be guaranteed, individuals will remain
dependent on the vagaries of the annuities market for the kind of benefit
stream they can purchase with their lump sum.
But what it will do, the firm says, is to offer some guarantees against
stock market collapse. The guarantee consists of a promise that individuals
will earn at least 90 per cent of the average daily market value of the
units in the pool in each year they participate. When they retire, they
surrender their units at the full value on that day. The guarantee means
that if equity prices tumble one year, individuals do not have to surrender
the gains they made in prior years.
Consulting actuaries who help companies choose pension fund investment
managers are studying the product closely. Mr Martin Kemp, associate partner
with consulting actuaries Bacon and Woodrow, said it bears some similarity
to a product launched by several insurance companies in the 1970s but
abandoned. 'We are looking at it to see if the guarantee offered is worth
the price,' Mr Kemp said.
Mr Graham Dixon of SG Warburg, who designed the product, said the reason it
is now workable and affordable has to do with the advent of a sophisticated
market in over-the-counter derivatives.
Individuals who select the guarantee fund purchase units in a pool. For
every Pounds 100 invested, Pounds 99 goes into the pool while Pounds 1 will
go into a special reserve fund. Warburg has left itself an 'out' clause by
retaining the ability both to raise the 0.9 per cent management fee charged
on the pool and to increase the proportion of pension contribution which
goes into the reserve.
What makes the product interesting is the way the reserve pool is invested.
As pension contributions are made, managers need to calculate the
liabilities - the benefits of those set to retire - for the next five years.
Roughly 10 per cent of the reserve pool will be used to buy over-the-counter
put options on the FTSE which are 10 per cent 'out of the money'. There is
an element of risk because the guarantee the investor receives is against
the broader market rather than against the top 100 stocks.
Mr Dixon concedes that the reserve fund could be vulnerable if the entire
market fell precipitously but the top 100 stocks outperformed the broad
market. However, in pre-market research going back to 1919 this situation
never arose.
Another 80 per cent will be invested in the equity pool itself, so the
returns to the reserve will mimic the sums it is guaranteeing. A further 10
per cent will be used to purchase options to cover the 'out of the money'
portion of the initial put options.
Mr Dixon calculates that the cost to Warburg of providing the protection is
roughly 3 per cent to 4 per cent of the total invested, although he is more
vague about the cost to the individual.
The cost will reflect, to some extent, the amount of income effectively
surrendered by agreeing to accept only 90 per cent of the average market
value of equities in any given year.

FT  19 JUL 93 / Floating Rate Notes: Collared deals lead a resurgence of
issuance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HARDLY a week goes by without the launch of several new floating rate note
(FRN) issues, on the belief that short-term interest rates in the US have
hit rock-bottom and are set for an upturn.
Last week was no exception as a batch of European banks (including
Bayerische Landesbank, Dresdner Bank, Bayerische Vereinsbank, and Credit
Commercial de France) all launched collared floating rate deals and helped
take the week's issuance to more than Dollars 1bn.
Bayerische Landesbank and Dresdner Bank, both triple A-rated names, launched
deals which were identical save for the amount raised.
CCF, which has a senior debt rating of Aa3, launched an issue with identical
terms except for the price, which at 99.5 (against 99.875 for the other two)
was seen as adequately reflecting the difference in credit quality.
All four borrowers had the coupon set at six-month Libor less 25 basis
points, with a floor of 5 per cent and a cap of 8 per cent.
The previous week's activity in this sector was dominated by a
widely-praised new FRN issue for Credit Lyonnais, which was increased from
Dollars 1bn to Dollars 1.25bn due to strong demand and provided the market
with a liquid issue.
The big US houses expect to bring plenty more FRNs (both of the collared
variety, where there is a minimum and maximum coupon, and the 'plain
vanilla' ordinary FRN), given that demand remains strong and that borrowers,
generally banks, are obviously keen to take advantage of cheaper terms in
the FRN sector as and when they arise.
The renaissance of the FRN sector began last summer as market participants
began to wonder whether US short-term interest rates had bottomed out.
Several months later, many would argue that dollar short-term rates are
'treading water'.
Market experts point out that the resurgence has been led by collared
products, and it is easy to see why. Last week, six-month dollar Libor was
quoted at 3.5 per cent: yet most of the collared FRNs with 12-year
maturities that were launched last week had floors of 5 per cent and caps of
8 per cent. Investors have been focusing on the floor because they see an
immediate pick-up and can lock into higher returns.
'Investors have had a good deal over the last few months - these have proved
very nice transactions for them,' said one UK observer of the
dollar-denominated FRN market. In some cases, investors expect to benefit as
the creditworthiness of borrowers such as US banks improves.
In the meantime, dealers point out, caps have shifted down from about 10 per
cent last summer to around 8 per cent at present, reflecting the belief that
while interest rates may increase, the rise will not be as fast as
previously thought.
'If interest rates go up slowly, collared floaters will be in vogue, whereas
if rates go up quickly, 'plain vanilla' FRNs will be in vogue,' said one
analyst.
US houses report both retail and institutional investor interest in collared
FRNs, although the interest in these structured products tends to come from
Switzerland and continental European investors.
'Given that the outlook for dollar interest rates is neutral to positive,
one would expect to see more of these collared deals: problems will only
arise if interest rates rise to close to 8 per cent, when you won't expect
to see much of a bid for the paper,' warned one FRN specialist.

FT  19 JUL 93 / US Money and Credit: Long-bond yield heads towards 6.5%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE US credit market's attention will be focused on Washington this week,
where Mr Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, will give his
semi-annual Humphrey-Hawkins report on monetary policy to Congress against
the backdrop of a bond rally which has carried long rates to record lows.
On Friday, for the seventh successive trading session, the yield on the
30-year Treasury issue dropped to the lowest level since the Federal
government began issuing these bonds on a regular basis 16 years ago.
The long bond ended the week with a yield of 6.54 per cent, down from 6.64
per cent a week earlier after a raft of statistics showing that fears of
inflation in the early summer were greatly exaggerated, and highlighting new
signs of sluggish growth.
The biggest push to the market came from the producer and consumer price
indices for June, released on Tuesday and Wednesday. The producer price
index for finished goods dropped 0.3 per cent, its largest monthly decline
since January 1991, while the consumer index was unchanged from May, its
best performance since March 1991.
But the rally was reinforced by figures on Friday showing that industrial
production dipped one-fifth of a percentage point last month, its first
decline since last September, and rumours that a closely watched gauge of
consumer confidence was showing a drop in early July.
The economy is certainly growing slowly, but is the outlook so sluggish that
the Fed will feel moved to eliminate the bias towards tightening which it
put in place last May (and artfully leaked to the market) at the height of
the inflation scare?
Mr Greenspan, a master of the verbal stonewall, is unlikely to reveal this
to Congress on Tuesday, though he is expected to cut his forecast of
economic growth this year to around 2.5 per cent from the 3 per cent to 3.25
per cent rate he suggested in his last Humphrey-Hawkins testimony in
February.
At the same time, the Fed's expectations of inflation seem likely to rise to
around 3 per cent from the 2.5 per cent to 2.75 per cent rate foreseen in
February, which most analysts always considered extremely optimistic.
Still, there seem to be few inflationary clouds on the horizon. The severe
flooding by the Mississippi will give an upward blip to some agricultural
prices, but the past week has also brought some significant signs of
contrary trends.
Procter &amp; Gamble, the consumer products giant, announced big detergent price
cuts, while General Motors is promising to raise its vehicle prices by an
average of only 1.8 per cent in the model year that begins in the autumn.
Most Wall Street analysts expect this background to keep Fed policy on hold
for the immediate future, possibly the whole year, yet some wonder whether a
touch of monetary easing could be in prospect before the summer is out.
Mr Mitchell Held, of Smith Barney, suggests that if Congress can agree on a
meaningful budget deficit reduction programme, and the economic growth and
inflation numbers remain 'well-behaved', then the Fed will implement a
modest easing to avoid a more pervasive slowdown.
However, the Fed is unlikely to consider such action without the Senate and
House of Representatives resolving their differences over a deficit package
 -and expectations of agreement on legislation are already largely factored
into bond prices.
Any signs of serious difficulties in Congress over the next few weeks could
severely upset the market's upward momentum, which might also be tried by a
heavy Treasury refinancing operation in the second week of August. But with
those caveats, the odds look good for the long bond yield falling through
the psychologically significant level of 6.5 per cent.

FT  19 JUL 93 / In search of that old Strauss magic: Bavaria's radical new
premier plans tough action to restore the state's fortunes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The headline in Munich's Suddeutsche Zeitung said it clearly enough: Bavaria
is selling its family silver.
Within a month of taking over as prime minister of Germany's prosperous and
independent-minded 'free state' of Bavaria, Mr Edmund Stoiber, a former
state interior minister and law-and-order crusader in the ruling Christian
Social Union, appears to be hell-bent on privatising his government's most
profitable shareholdings.
Large strategic stakes in Bayernwerk, one of Germany's big three energy
utilities, and Deutsche Aerospace (Dasa), the Daimler Benz aerospace
subsidiary which contains what used to be Messerschmidt, are to be sold off.
The state's one-third share in the Rhine-Main-Danube canal company is
another candidate for disposal, along with a host of smaller holdings in
areas such as energy and waste disposal.
Mr Stoiber hopes to raise DM2bn-DM3bn from the process. While other Lander,
and the federal government itself, are merely muttering about a new phase of
privatisation, Bavaria looks set to start.
The state premier also announced that all political privileges for
government ministers and senior officials are to be abolished: everything
ranging from free seats at the Bavarian state opera to salaries for
lucrative seats on company supervisory boards, must in future be accounted
for and, where necessary, repaid to state funds.
It is the most radical step in Germany so far to counter the wave of public
disquiet over endless petty scandals in ministerial offices. In recent
months a string of leading politicians have been forced to resign. The most
recent was Mr Stoiber's predecessor, Mr Max Streibl, who admitted taking
holidays at a business friend's expense.
Mr Stoiber's move also strikes at the heart of the cosy relationship enjoyed
by business and the political establishment in Germany, and in Bavaria as
much as anywhere.
It is enough to make Mr Franz Josef Strauss, the father of Bavaria's postwar
economic revival, promoter and close patron of its defence and aerospace
industry, and prime minister until he died in office in 1988, turn in his
grave. Or perhaps it is precisely what he would have done.
For Mr Stoiber is the man who probably more than any other was Mr Strauss'
closest confidant over his last decade in power. First as secretary-general
of the CSU, then as head of the state chancery, and finally as minister of
state in the prime minister's office, he was often the mouthpiece of his
master in his negotiations with Bonn and the other federal states.
Today he is attempting to bring a little bit of the Strauss magic back to
Munich, where the sharp downturn in the German economy, the costs of
unification and severe cuts in the federal government's defence budget are
undermining Bavaria's own success story.
Worse still, for a politician, Mr Stoiber's ruling CSU is in danger of
losing its absolute majority in the state parliament in next year's
elections. It faces an erosion of support both to the Social Democrats on
the left, and to the far-rightwing Republicans. And it is facing up to the
humiliating possibility that it might fail altogether to win any seats in
the European Parliament, because its shrinking provincial base is not enough
to guarantee it the minimum national vote of 5 per cent.
Germany faces no fewer than 19 European, national, state and local authority
elections next year, and three concern Bavaria directly. Mr Stoiber believes
they will be decided by two issues: the economy and internal security,
including the highly-sensitive issue of immigration. On both issues he faces
a big challenge.
Bavaria remains one of the wealthiest states in the federal republic, thanks
to the range of modern industry which Mr Strauss successfully enticed,
browbeat or simply bought with straight subsidies to come to his home state.
The defence industry has been as badly hit as any by the recent budget cuts
and the economic downturn. Dasa alone has said it will lay off some 8,000
workers. But Mr Stoiber knows that the economic challenge is more profound.
'What we have today is not a normal recession, but a structural recession
which we would have had to overcome even if there had not been unification,'
he says. 'You have the same problems in Britain, France or Sweden. But we
have the low-wage countries on our very doorstep.'
Mr Stoiber's answer is to relaunch the drive to promote an indigenous
high-tech industry, focused on small and medium-sized enterprises -
Germany's famed Mittelstand. And that is precisely where he plans to put the
funds he can raise from privatisation.
'It is not just a question of our financial problems,' he says. 'It is a
question of principle for me. We don't want state capitalism here. I am a
great supporter of privatisation.'
He recognises that the state's 58 per cent stake in Bayernwerk played an
important role in Bavaria's economic success. For the Bavarian government
ensured that electricity supplies were switched steadily from reliance on
expensive coal from the northern Ruhr, to first oil and now nuclear power.
With two-thirds of its power from that source, Bavaria now has the cheapest
electricity in Germany.
The change is that the European energy market is opening up, and other
producers, such as France, are offering cheap supplies. 'It is no longer
necessary to have a state energy policy operated through one's own energy
company,' Mr Stoiber says. He may be a bit disingenuous. The plan is
gradually to merge Bayernwerk with Viag, the Bonn-based conglomerate which
is already a minority shareholder. In return, Mr Stoiber expects Viag to
move to Munich. And for the time being, the state will retain its 25.1 per
cent stake in Viag.
Privatisation is only one radical answer to the problems of Bavaria and the
CSU. The latest polls show the ruling party languishing on about 43 per cent
of popular support - down almost 12 percentage points on the 1990 election -
with the SPD, the real challengers, up to almost 33 per cent.
Yet the Republicans, on the far right, are the real threat to the CSU's
traditional conservative heartland. They are both anti-immigration and
anti-EC. The former is one clear reason why the party opted for Mr Stoiber
over the more middle-of-the-road Mr Theo Waigel, the finance minister in
Bonn and party leader.
The Bavarian premier certainly does not mince his words on questions of
immigration. 'We are not an immigration country,' he insists. 'That would
result in a multi-cultural society. And a multi-cultural society would be a
terrible thing.'
And yet he is not a fanatical nationalist. Like Mr Strauss, he is a
convinced European, although he believes the Maastricht agenda for a single
currency is far too optimistic.
'Economic and monetary union will not come about this century,' he says.
'The convergence criteria are the main barrier, and they must not be
changed. In the foreseeable future, no member state will be able to meet
them.'
In some ways, Mr Stoiber sounds almost like a sceptical UK conservative. He
is a critic of excessive Brussels decision-making and believes the EC should
go slow on institutional integration, and concentrate on enlargement.
Mr Stoiber says the Republicans have lost much of their grounds for
criticism with the tougher restrictions on asylum-seekers, which came into
effect on July 1. He played a big part in drafting the measures in Bonn, as
state Bavaria's interior minister.
Yet perhaps the greatest threat he sees to all the traditional political
parties is the growing public apathy and alienation from the political
process. That is why he has seized the political initiative so swiftly, both
on privatisation and privilege. Even if he is selling off the family silver,
Mr Strauss would probably have approved of the motive.

FT  19 JUL 93 / Letter: A Nobel prize for Bhagwati
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ONESIMO ALVAREZ-MORO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Samuel Brittan believes that neither academic macro-economists nor
economic commentators have been at the forefront of the trade debate ('Trade
and macroeconomics', July 12).
He need look no further than the FT's own pages to see that Prof Jagdish
Bhagwati has been the most lucid, jargon-free and easy to understand
academic that one could possibly hope to read. Prof Bhagwati was even
adviser to Arthur Dunkel, the recently-departed head of the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
Indeed, such is his patience and commitment over the years that the
so-called free trade exceptions outlined by Prof Paul Krugman and others
have been consistently shown to be a re-hash of the same old protectionist
arguments.
Prof Bhagwati deserves a Nobel prize for patience for being there when
needed to knock fatuous protectionist arguments on their head. He also
deserves the Nobel prize for economics for his many years of clear thinking.
The free trade area is badly in need of this award, given the knife-edge
which we are currently on in the Gatt neg-otiations.

FT  19 JUL 93 / The best judges: Hugo Dixon argues that beneficiaries should
control their pension schemes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGO DIXON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Who should control Britain's occupational pension schemes, employers or the
schemes' beneficiaries?
This question is one of the central tasks facing the Goode Committee, which
was set up by the government to review pension law following the Maxwell
fraud and is due to report in the autumn. How the question is answered will
have wide ramifications not only for people's pensions but also for their
careers.
Presently, control of schemes and their estimated Pounds 500bn in assets
lies with employers. They decide contribution and benefit rates, appoint
trustees, determine investment policy and retain the right to wind up
schemes. Current and prospective pensioners - the 'members' - have little or
no say over how schemes are run, despite saving large proportions of their
income through the schemes.
The debate on occupational pension reform has concentrated on devising
measures to prevent fraud and compensate its victims. While this is
essential, a bold reform would also transfer control of schemes to their
members who would then elect trustees and vote on how schemes should be run.
The case for doing so is strong.
At present, most schemes operate on a 'final salary' basis - meaning
members' pensions are based on the size of their final salaries and the
number of years worked for the company. Companies underwrite the schemes,
topping them up when investment returns are bad and stopping contributions
when performance is good.
Such a system would be suitable if people spent their whole working lives
with a single company. But this is increasingly rare, as people move jobs to
develop their careers, take periods out of work to bring up children, lose
their jobs through redundancy, switch to part-time work or are forced into
early retirement. And, unless people remain as full-time employees with a
single company all their working lives, their pensions can be substantially
reduced under final salary schemes.
Democratic control of schemes by their members would lead to a more flexible
and equitable way of determining the size of pensions, if only because
employers would no longer be willing to underwrite schemes which they did
not control. Instead of making variable contributions according to whether
schemes were in surplus or deficit, companies would probably move to
contributing fixed proportions of employees' salaries. As a result, pensions
would be related to the size of individual contributions ' as is now the
case with personal pension schemes ' rather than salaries.
Such a move would give members greater freedom to tailor their pensions to
suit their individual circumstances. For example, they would be able to vary
contributions according to what they could afford at different periods in
their lives and to stay in schemes if they moved jobs, were made redundant
or took career breaks.
Relating pensions to the size of contributions would also be fairer. Those
who left companies before official retirement ages would no longer subsidise
those who stayed the full course, in particular top executives whose
pensions are sometimes artificially boosted by large salary increases
immediately before retirement.
A further advantage of transferring power to members would be to eliminate
the conflict of interest between an employer's role as custodian of members'
interests and its duty to promote shareholder value.
Conflicts do not only exist in extreme cases such as the Maxwell fraud. The
wide discretion companies possess over managing schemes ensures there are
many legal ways of running schemes to enrich shareholders rather than the
schemes' beneficiaries. Companies can, for example, claw back surpluses, use
schemes to finance redundancy programmes or fail to increase pensions in
line with inflation.
Transferring power to members would not end all conflicts of interest. For
example, those nearing retirement might prefer low-risk investment
strategies to be adopted, while younger members might want riskier but
potentially more rewarding approaches. But at least such conflicts,
currently decided behind closed doors, would be debated openly in a more
democratic system.
Employers might even welcome a dilution of their control. Given that many
are having to start making contributions again now that most pension fund
surpluses have shrunk, companies might embrace the opportunity to limit
their liabilities by moving to a system of fixed contrib-utions.
But the pensions industry would resist transferring control of schemes to
members. It would be quick to point out the uncertainties such a democratic
revolution would introduce for employees. In particular, without employers
underwriting schemes, pensions could be at the mercy of day-to-day stock
market fluctuations.
Employers' willingness to cushion the effect of market fluctuations is an
attractive feature of the current system. But employers' fears that
transferring control to members would expose them to huge risks are
alarmist. There are many ways of hedging, insuring and pooling risks, while
financial markets are continually adept at devising new ones.
Strategies to limit risk would clearly not provide members with total
protection in the event of extreme movements in financial markets. But it
would be disingenuous to pretend that the current system provides members
with copper-bottomed guarantees either, as Maxwell pensioners know only too
well.
In any case, the argument for democratic control of pension schemes ' as
with democratic reform in any field ' is not that it would eliminate risk.
It is rather that people should be free to decide for themselves how their
pensions should be managed because they are ultimately the best judges of
what is in their interests.

FT  19 JUL 93 / Letter: Price for water must be paid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr A R T KEMASANG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, You leader, 'The value of clean water' (July 14), is both one-sided and
myopic. It is one-sided for looking at the question of value in strictly
limited financial terms. Although the FT is a financial paper, it is still
taking too much liberty in assuming that all of its readers are no more than
financial zombies. To some, probably many, questions of 'cost' and 'price'
are woefully one-dimensional. They also pale into insignificance when
addressed in context - ie, without ignoring such questions as our health and
that of future genera-tions.
It is myopic for missing the opportunity to put the priorities right. The
'huge sums involved' in bringing our water up to par with the rest of the EC
is surely the price we pay for neglecting its upkeep for so long. You don't
have to be a financial genius to know that it is a matter of time before the
price has to be paid.
Why put our health and that of our children to more unknown risks by
postponing further the unavoidable? For a postponement of the inevitable, in
the form of longer time to meet the directives, is all we are likely to get.
And while we're 'renegotiating' EC directives the price in terms of our
health keeps mounting.

FT  19 JUL 93 / Letter: The real role of the trade association
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr MICHAEL G BURCHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The principal role of a trade organisation is to do those things which
member companies believe is most beneficial to their industry. It is not
necessarily to lobby government on legislation and likely changes of policy.
And size does not necessarily equate with effectiveness.
The Galvanizers Association meets the DTI's criteria for a 'lead
association' and the DTI acknowledges this to be so. But four years ago the
association separated from an existing confederation and established a clear
and separate identity. We took the opportunity to establish focused
programmes operated by a professional, well-qualified and properly paid
staff. Industry participants, including suppliers, have committed
substantial financial resources to a range of programmes in which marketing
and technical support to the market-place predominate. When we deal with the
UK government we seek constructive dialogue; when we deal with the European
Commission we act with our EC counterpart organisations through established
channels in Brussels.
An aspect of Mr Heseltine's speech which was less well reported was his
announcement of a benchmarking challenge, in which industry associations
will operate 'benchmarking clubs' to help businesses improve
competitiveness.
If the same principles were applied to industry associations we would see
the emergence of powerful, well-resourced and fully-effective organisations
with improved quality of lobbying in Whitehall and Brussels. This is just
what Mr Heseltine wants. Such groups would also command stronger industry
support because they would provide better value to the subscription dollar.

FT  19 JUL 93 / Letter: The real role of the trade association
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr BARRY HIGGS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Andrew Taylor draws attention to the large number of trade associations
and the intention of the president of the board of trade to limit the number
with which his department has contact.
Some reduction might be appropriate, but we should bear in mind that it is
the member companies of these associations which pay the bills and decide
what they need in their dealings with UK government departments. Most
up-coming legislation emanates from Brussels in any case and, in today's
complex environment, expert knowledge from specialist groups is critically
important if the wealth-makers in our society are not to be disadvantaged.
Larger, more generalist, associations such as the Confederation of British
Industry have an important role in influencing the general business climate.
Similarly, the Chemical Industries Association represents its manufacturers
in respect of their processes and practices. This leaves the sectoral
associations to promote the interests of the particular product groups.
It would be a pity if the DTI's work for British industry was to be
inhibited by a doctrinal handicap.

FT  19 JUL 93 / Letter: The real role of the trade association
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ROBERT COOK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In his excellent article on trade associations ('Lobbying not worth a
button', July 15), Andrew Taylor puts a very persuasive case for Britain's
2,000-plus trade associations to modernise and become more effective in both
the lobbying process and in the range of services they provide to their
members.
The gist of a speech by Mr Michael Heseltine, the president of the board of
trade, about trade associations to the Confederation of British Industry in
June was that, from a DTI standpoint, too many associations are narrowly
focused, poorly resourced and ill-equipped to help the industries they
represent become competitive. He therefore specifically welcomed
developments in the chemicals and electronics sectors, where there have
recently been a number of trade association mergers, as examples of what
should be happening more widely across industry.
It is certainly our experience in the Electronic Engineering Association
that there is a 'critical mass' below which it is impossible for a trade
association to provide sufficient resources to maintain effective contacts
with government, Brussels and the many other national and international
agencies which today affect the business environment in which member
companies operate. We therefore strongly support Mr Heseltine's call for the
development of a single, well-resourced trade association to represent each
big sector of industry.
The EEA itself is the result of a number of mergers. It will enlarge again
by joining the Electronic Components Industry Federation to form a new
Federation of the Electronics Industry on January 1 1994. The FEI will have
more than 300 member companies and provide a powerful focus for
telecommunications, information technology, defence electronics, business
equipment, office products and electronic components elements of the
electronics industry. Robert Cook,

BILLY Roache made his name as a playwright at London's Bush Theatre with a
trilogy about his native Wexford. The Cavalcaders, commissioned by the Abbey
Theatre for their small stage, The Peacock, is his first play to open in
Ireland.
The Cavalcaders are a quartet of barber-shop singers who work together by
day in a Wexford cobblers and perform in local bars by night, dressed in
matching red dinner jackets. Roache's interest in memory - is indicated
before the play starts by his familiar device of filling the auditorium with
vintage pop music, most significantly, the chorus 'Can't Get Used to Losing
You'.
As the play opens, a glum figure in a raincoat, Terry, is handing over his
shoe repair business to a younger man, Rory, who plans to modernise it. The
set, by Frank Conway, is highly evocative: a battered Victorian cobbler's
bench, massive old machinery, dirty coffee mugs and dusty, string-tied
bundles of shoes dating back years. In these unlikely surroundings Terry
relives the heyday of the quartet before the departure of the other two
members, Josie and Ted.
Sudden changes of lighting (designed by Trevor Dawson) indicate leaps back
in time. We see Terry at the age of 44 brutally ending his affair with
Nuala, a warm and vulnerable 22-year-old, recently released from the 'funny
farm'. He would be better suited to the more mature Breda, who drops in to
listen to rehearsals, but he has never recovered from his wife running off
with another man.
It takes some time to realise that Terry, easily the dullest of the four
men, is actually the central character. Rory and Ted stick in the mind only
as 'the good looking blond one' and 'the one who plays the piano'. Rather
unexpectedly, Ted runs off with Rory's wife in a sketchy sub-plot.
However, all three are overshadowed by the fourth member of the quartet,
Josie, a jaunty provincial corner-boy who dies young, presumably from
cancer. Josie is played by Billy Roache, his thin angular frame, foxy face
and receding hair giving credence to this quick-witted, tabloid-reading,
pint-drinking chancer. But that Josie is so likeable and also 'doomed'
distracts from the central drama, which, unfortunately, is Terry's.
His rejection of Nuala led, he believes, to her suicide. But he is also
mourning the disappearance of the community he knew as a child, when The
Cavalcaders were the pride of the neighbourhood.
Nuala is played with heart-aching naivety by Marie Mullen, and Breda (who
eventually ends up living with Terry) is given a sad dignity by Aisling
O'Sullivan. But ultimately the women contribute little, as they are seen
only as Terry's girlfriends.
For all the technical achievement of the writing, the play is disappointing,
and oddly unsatisfying. Terry, a selfish emotional cripple, never grows or
changes. There is little or no sense of the claustrophobia of the dead-end
small town which electrified the Wexford trilogy, nor, apart from Josie, any
truly memorable characters.
It is not often an author upstages his own play, but Billy Roache has done
it here. See it for his dazzling performance, but don't expect too much
else.
City of Angels, the musical which was to close early on August 7, has won a
reprieve and will continue at London's Prince of Wales Theatre.
Written by Cy Coleman and Larry Gelbart, it was enthusiastically reviewed
when it opened in March. But it suffered from a lack of advance bookings and
the early closure was announced last week. A surge of interest followed and
Angels has been playing to packed houses.

FT  19 JUL 93 / Arts: Elektra - London Promenade Concerts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Big choral works have often opened the first night of the BBC Proms season,
but this year the director, John Drummond, chose an opera. On Friday, we had
a concert performance of Richard Strauss's Elektra, which left the stalwart
BBC Singers to sit patiently for the better part of two hours before they
got anything to sing. But the principals need to be leather-lunged,
inexhaustible; and on that score the international cast could not be
faulted.
Nor, really, on anything else that mattered: any leading opera house would
be proud to have such a team. If this was not the most memorable Elektra you
might hear, it was impressively strong and balanced. Andrew Davis, who has
become a notable exponent of Strauss's more lyrical operas, conducted the
BBC Symphony.
In two or three places, one missed the vicious edge that can sharpen the
horrific goings-on, and though Davis built the final catastrophe
effectively, the gross, hysterical exuberance of Elektra's triumph-dance was
a trifle tame. On a lucky night, once the murders are accomplished the music
can seem to hurl itself unstoppably forward into fatality; the Davis reading
was too nicely controlled for that.
More attention to the 'semi-staging' would have been wise. Nobody was
credited for it in the programme, and the singers seemed to have been left
to improvise it, with some odd results. When Elektra should be scrabbling in
the earth for the buried axe - not easy to do on a carpeted platform] -
Marilyn Zschau seized the chance, understandably, to gulp some water: our
heroine seemed to be pouring herself a stiff drink before getting on with
the matricide. The Aegisthus, William Cochrane, walked slowly with a cane,
and was still visible on the exit stairs when he was meant to be in the
throes of assassination.
Cochrane was nevertheless excellently tetchy and dignified. As Clytemnestra,
his partner in guilt, Eva Randova wielded pungent, edgy tone - not a
contralto bellow - to make the most of the Queen's darting slyness and
baleful suspicions (and supplied bloodcurdling offstage death-cries). Much
to her credit, she disdained any campy grotesqueries. The first words of
Willard White's bass-baritone Orestes administered one of the dramatic
thrills of the evening: that doomy, implacable sound was perfect, and White
sustained it up to his measured departure, murder-bent.
The central sisters, Miss Zschau and as Chrysothemis Deborah Voigt, were
visually ill-matched: by rights young Chrysothemis should be vapidly pretty
and sweet, and Elektra a haggard, unkempt witch, where Miss Voigt showed us
a handsome matron and Miss Zschau a seductive gypsy with chic ringlets and a
whole repertoire of balletic gestures.
Still, for a concert performance such quibbles are unimportant. More to the
point, Voight's Chrysothemis was gorgeously sung - impeccably musical,
subtle with details, the voice glowing confidently to the end. Until the
confrontation with the Queen, I thought Miss Zschau's hard-ish timbre might
be too unvaried (and her German consonants too biteless) to make a complete
Elektra. With her feral vision of Orestes hunting Clytemnestra through the
palace corridors, however, the portrayal took fire. The voice opened out
excitingly; in all the rest of the opera, the wild veerings between joy and
despair were splendid, and her dramatic pacing (except for that little
drink) utterly assured.

FT  19 JUL 93 / Arts: A castle fit to house a modern monarchy - Architecture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN AMERY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Last week two related events occurred that brought a bit of life to the
architectural world. One was that Country Life, the magazine with a
first-rate architectural editor in the shape of Mr Giles Worsley, announced
the results of its competition for the rebuilding of parts of Windsor Castle
damaged by fire.
The other was also related to Windsor Castle, the appearance of a book
Windsor, the Most Romantic Castle by Mark Girouard, which contains a chapter
devoted to new ideas for rebuilding the castle's burnt-out St George's Hall.
Both sets of ideas form the basis of an exhibition at the Architecture
Foundation in London, which it is hoped will then travel to all parts of the
kingdom.
When the smoke finally blew away from the charred ruins of the castle after
the fire last November, crowds of the curious and the impertinent came
forward with their views on what should be done. In fact, the damage was not
as bad as had been thought. Only the north-east corner of the Upper Ward was
affected. But it was a part of the castle that contains several important
rooms.
The fire began in the private chapel and attacked St George's Hall, the
Grand Reception Room, the Octagon Room in the Brunswick Tower, the Dining
Room, Crimson and Green Drawings Rooms and the Great Kitchen. It spread with
sickening speed through the roofs of these rooms, but, although it damaged
the walls, they are not beyond repair. By a stroke of good fortune, the
furnishings of these rooms had been removed for a rewiring programme and it
all survives.
The survival of almost all the furnishings and works of art from these rooms
would seem to make it sensible speedily to rebuild the castle exactly as it
was in before the fire.
But, naturally enough, there have been strange cries from architects calling
for contemporary contributions to the rebuilding. Mr Girouard's book and the
competition entries from Country Life are part of a campaign to promote a
debate which tries to relate the rebuilding of Windsor to the modernisation
of the monarchy as an institution.
Competitions should be judged by their results, not simply by their good
intentions. The 10 proposals for St George's Hall in the Girouard book come
not only from architects, but also stage and lighting designers. It is a
strange list that seems to demonstrate how difficult it is for architects
and designers to understand the purpose of state rooms, the role of history
and the functions of the monarchy. The implication is that Wyatt Ville's
work at Windsor was dull and there is little understanding of how the castle
works when it is filled with the colour and glitter of, for example, a state
banquet in St George's Hall or a procession of Knights of the Garter.
The sense of continuity is the essence of an hereditary monarchy and the
wish of so many of these designers to 'bring light colour and change' into
the castle may be almost as destructive as the intrusion of the media. There
should be an element of poetry about any scheme for what has been described
as 'the most romantic castle' and that is exactly what is missing from so
many of the laboured designs in both competitions.
The idea of leaving the Great Hall as a ruin, as proposed by Mr Rowan Moore,
does have a certain Gothic romance, but also opts out of the architectural
debate. More feasible is the plan by Roderick Gradidge to add a steeply
pitched roof to the hall and redecorate in a rich, almost Puginesque manner.
One entrant, Douglas Binnie, has combined his talents as an architect and a
sculptor in his elaborately iconographic schemes, and his Country Life entry
is one of the best presented.
Of the 10 Girouard schemes, only two are remotely workable. One is Richard
MacCormack's bronze and timber roof, inspired by but not imitative of the
original Gothic roof of St George's Hall; and the other is by Michael
Hopkins, who saw the decorative potential of the motif of the Garter Star.
There is, inevitably, a committee to discuss the restoration plans for the
castle. A decision is already made to rebuild the chapel area in a
contemporary way. This area, where the fire began, was a remodelling by Sir
Hugh Casson of the 1842 chapel by Edward Blore. Whether a private chapel is
needed at this point in the castle's history may be debatable.
The committee may decide to build a modern roof on St George's Hall and they
would be foolish to overlook the wonderful timber designs of the Hungarian
architect Imrie Macovecz. He designed one of the best pavilions ad Seville's
Expo 92 and his work is remarkably original.
The committee will have the benefit of the experience of the National Trust
who are currently rebuilding Uppark in Sussex after a disastrous fire. They
will also take advice from those responsible for the recent excellent
restoration of Hampton Court.
The real opportunity offered by Windsor is involve in the restoration the
expertise of those responsible for the Royal Collection who made such a
splendid job of the refurbishment of Frogmore in Windsor Great Park. With
the gentle help of one or two good architects, Windsor should be restored
very much as it was.
Mark Girouard's agreeable book tells us something of the story of life at
Windsor. But his selection of contemporary architects and winners of Country
Life competition demonstrate that the modern imagination cannot deal with
either the romance of the castle or the appropriate panoply for the home of
the head of state.

FT  19 JUL 93 / Arts: Adam and Eve in the Garden of Lenin - Avignon Festival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY CURTIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE OF the most interesting productions of this year's Avignon Festival,
which continues until August 2, is a French version of Mikhail Bulgakov's
play, Adam and Eve. It is performed in the courtyard of Sainte-Marthe
Hospital by a company from Nancy Lorraine under their director, Charles
Tordjman.
The play was written in 1931 when Bulgakov, aged 40, supposedly still under
the protection of Stalin, was having his work shelved by the various state
theatre companies to which he was attached.
Commissioned as a play about a future war, Adam and Eve was never produced
during the author's lifetime. Seeing it more than half a century later, one
can understand why. The play predicts the complete collapse of the communist
system and looks to an era when co-operation with the West and shared
scientific knowledge is the only road to survival.
The piece begins conventionally enough in a communal apartment in Leningrad
where a young engineer, Adam, is celebrating his marriage to Eve, a foreign
language student.
Their honeymoon proves short-lived, as the apartment is invaded by a
distraught professor of chemistry, who is fleeing from a young thug who has
set upon him in the street. He turns up too, and is soon joined by a
fighter-pilot, who is a dedicated communist, and by a hack novelist.
As they all quarrel angrily, it seems as if we are in for a comedy about
shared domestic space under communism, one of Bulgakov's favourite themes.
But there is a more sinister undertone: the scientist is behaving very
oddly, even for an absent-minded professor. He carries a curious-looking
camera with which he photographs the married couple, enveloping them in a
sinister green glow, and he mutters incoherently about the danger of poison
gas causing universal disaster.
Puffing furiously at his cigarette, the French actor, Daniel Martin,
captures brilliantly the attitude of a man forgetful of his present
situation but deeply concerned about the long-term one. Hardly are the words
out of his mouth, when what he has prophesised comes to pass. A wave of
poison gas fumes - shades of Chernobyl] - sweeps across the city, then the
entire country, and everyone - well, almost everyone - is destroyed.
This catastrophe is represented on stage by an instant change of scene in
which the apartment building collapses and we are confronted by one of the
main shopping streets, strewn with rubble and corpses, wreathed in smoke.
Luckily, Adam and Eve have survived to inhabit a world like that after
Hiroshima, and so has the professor. His camera was really a secret weapon
with which he could close up the cells of the body and make them impervious
to the noxious gas.
Thanks to a series of fortunate accidents, all the other main characters we
met in the first act remain alive, if not exactly well. From here, the piece
becomes an exploration of the strategy of survival, well acted all round,
the company seizing the comedy as well as the pathos.
I was reminded at times of Shaw and also of The Admirable Crichton, as the
absent-minded professor turned into the strong man who keeps the group
together and wins the love of the most earnest, feminist Eve (Aude Briant)
during a sequence of stimulating discussions.
I would have been content to leave it there, with Eve replacing the
professor's dog, who has been killed in the holocaust, as his love object,
and the professor replacing Adam as hers - a conclusion prefiguring
Bulgakov's major novel, The Master and the Margarita. But the director
seemed to think that the work needed updating and encouraged the translator,
Bernard Noel, who does a fine job in that role, to write an epilogue that
was performed immediately after the author's text. Here, the maid, who died,
is reincarnated as the professor's animal friend (an idea borrowed from
Bulgakov's satirical story, Heart of a Dog).
This seemed an unnecessary extra course to the meal. Without it, the evening
was complete and admirably adventurous, much in line with the general policy
of Bernard Faivre d'Arcier, who has been reappointed as the Festival's
artistic director in succession to Alain Crombecque.
D'Arcier believes that the Festival should take the initiative in promoting
productions that extend the boundaries of theatre and dance as art-forms. In
a period of tightening purse-strings for the Festival, he has set aside a
fund of FFr3m for this purpose.
Other efforts in this direction include a collaboration between a number of
groups from all over the world, including Britain, under the heading
Dark/Noir. They are all to be seen in the Aubanel Gymnasium, where
presentations at different levels of the building explore the world from the
point of view of the sightless and the partially sighted.
As Michel Reilhac, the overall director of the project, explains, the
audience is deprived of the tyranny of sight - blind people act as guides at
one stage - in order that it may achieve a renewed mastery over its
perceptions.
Also running throughout the whole Festival is a tour de force in the
Cloister of the Carmelites, by Philippe Caubert, who worked with Ariane
Mnouchkine for a number of years, telling the story of his life in fictional
form on stage as Le Roman d'un Acteur through improvised dialogue and
exaggerated mime.
Thus, in spite of a falling number of visitors, a wobbly franc and an
aggressive mistral, the Avignon Festival still flourishes as it moves
inexorably towards its 50th birthday.

FT  19 JUL 93 / People: Michaelson moves from MAM
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The revolving door at the top of Mercury Asset Management took another turn
last week with the announcement that Bob Michaelson, a director of the group
and chairman of its North American subsidiary Warburg Investment Management
International, is joining Citibank Global Asset Management at the end of
August.
In the past 18 months MAM, which once had a formidable reputation for
holding on to its staff, has lost star fund manager Leonard Licht, as well
as two other main board directors Richard Bernays and James Dawnay.
Neville Bowen, chief executive of Citibank Global Asset Management, says the
attraction for Michaelson was the international nature of his operation.
Based in London, Citi's new unit, created early last year, manages Dollars
68bn in assets, mostly for non-UK clients, via 26 investment teams around
the world. Mercury, by contrast, is a much more domestic operation. 'He has
been concerned with international markets all his life,' says Bowen.
Michaelson, 46, joins in the newly created role of global chief investment
officer. Bowen says he, together with a number of colleagues, had been
determining overall investment policy up to now. 'I am an investment person
and so that was not a problem, but what has happened is that we have been
growing so rapidly, we needed new resources.'
In his new job, Michaelson, who will work from London, will be managing all
the investment teams, determine global asset-allocation strategies, and also
be in charge of some of the largest accounts.
Earlier in his career, Michaelson was a managing director of Putnam
International Advisors in London; he had also worked for Putnam at its
Boston headquarters from 1978-1981. Joining MAM in 1984, he spent three
years in New York from 1987, returning to London in April 1990. In his
current assignment he has been in charge of investments in continental
Europe.

FT  19 JUL 93 / Construction Contracts: Jamuna bridge development
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
HYUNDAI ENGINEERING AND CONSTRUCTION, based in South Korea, has put in the
lowest bid of USDollars 221m (Pounds 147m)to build the 4.8km long Jamuna
Bridge in Bangladesh.
The lowest offer for the river training works came from the Dutch company,
HAM/Van Oord ACZ JV. Under the first alternative, with freedom to procure
stones from anywhere, it bid USDollars 309m (Pounds 206m) or alternatively
USDollars 269m (Pounds 179m) providing stones were procured from
neighbouring countries like India and Bhutan.
Rendel Palmer &amp; Tritton, which has been involved in the project since 1986,
will now work with its engineering partners, NEDECO of Holland, the local
Bangladesh Consultants and the Jamuna Multipurpose Bridge Authority on
evaluating all the tenders received.
The Rendel Palmer &amp; Tritton-led design team has waited 18 months to reach
this stage following the green light from the World Bank in January 1992
after a two-year review of the economic return of the project. The tender
process was delayed by the decision of the Bangladesh government to
re-tender on the river training works.
A much higher price, USDollars 356m (Pounds 237m), was quoted in the first
bid a few months ago when the contractor envisaged procurement of stones
from countries like Malaysiaand Indonesia. The re-tendered price has been
reduced by about USDollars 100m (Pounds 67m) under the option for procuring
stones from neighbouring countries.
The bridge will be the first fixed transport link across the river, which
forms a 15km barrier, separating the western side with its fertile
north-west zone, from the eastern side containing the commercial centre
Dhaka and the primary port, Chittagong.
The crossing will comprise a bridge structure about 4.8km wide, river
training works and road embankments on the flood plain between the river
training works and the high banks.

FT  19 JUL 93 / Construction Contracts: Upgrading offices in Singapore
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
WIMPEY-WOH HUP, a Wimpey Group joint venture company working in Singapore,
has won a Pounds 37m contract from the United Overseas Bank to carry out
extensive structural alterations and a total refurbishment to a 32-storey
tower block in the city.
The company's 82-week project involves removing the roof structure of the
Plaza 2 development to construct six additional floors of office
accommodation and plant rooms. Other features of the scheme include the
demolition of a banking hall which adjoins the base of the tower and the
replacement of all electrical and mechanical services.
The building will be completely reclad in new aluminium and granite panels.
In this way, Plaza 2, which was built in the 1970s, will be modernised to
reflect Plaza 1, a newly-built, 66-storey development on the same site.
Internal partition walls, floors and ceilings will be removed and upgraded.
The fit-out of all the building services in the tower - including
installation of air-conditioning, fire, electrical, lifts, escalators and
plumbing services - forms a major part of Wimpey- Woh Hup's contract.
When the new work is complete, Wimpey-Woh Hup will have created some 39,000
sq metres of commercial office accommodation which will be available for
rent.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
EDMUND NUTTALL has been awarded a contract to upgrade a section of the A406
London North Circular Road by the Department of Transport. Valued at Pounds
31.7m, the works are located at Finchley, extending 2.3 kilometres along the
A406 from close to its junction with the A1 Falloden Way to a point 400
metres east of its junction with the A1000 High Road Finchley.
The main works comprise the upgrading of the single carriageway to dual
three-lane standard, but there are several challenging structures en route.
The most significant is a 125-metre top-down construction underpass tunnel
which, with the western approach, involves around 575 linear metres of
diaphragm wall construction. The tunnel takes the new dual three-lane
carriageway under the A504 East End Road, a highly congested roundabout
junction with the A406.

FT  19 JUL 93 / Construction Contracts: Creating snow in Asia
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ACER SNOWMEC, a British company that has developed and patented a method of
creating snow for indoor winter sports facilities, has negotiated its first
international Snowcentre in Singapore.
The indoor ski and leisure centre, to be built on the island of Batam, will
be financed by a private developer as part of a Pounds 1bn leisure complex.
Phase I of the main development is already completed and the Snowcentre is
expected to be operating by the end of the year.
The snow is created by firing a mixture of water and compressed air into an
atmosphere of between -3'C and -10'C to produce snow crystals. A patented
thermal storage system reduces capital and running costs to commercially
viable levels.
The project is likely to be the first phase of larger project, with
negotiations for similar Snowcentres throughout the Asia Pacific region at
an advanced stage.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
M Rothschild is expanding its small coterie of managing directors from four
to six, promoting two men who could not be less like the stereotype merchant
banker - a geologist and a mechanical engineer and neither educated at
Oxbridge.
Welshman Keith Palmer, 45, the grandson of a miner, is the bank's natural
resources expert, and has been responsible for building up Rothschild's
corporate and project finance business in the energy, mining and utilities
sectors, both in the UK and abroad. Currently looking after the British Coal
mandate, Palmer (right) has also brought in plenty of overseas business;
last year the UK merchant bank was financial adviser on Argentina's Dollars
3.99bn Gas del Estado deal, which was the largest energy privatisation
outside the UK.
Before joining Rothschild's in 1984, Palmer, who took a degree in geology
from Birmingham University, had spent four years in the energy department of
the World Bank. Earlier experience included a year with the IMF, two years
in Tanzania and four years with the finance ministry in Papua New Guinea. He
works within the corporate finance department; the divisional head, Russell
Edey, is already a managing director.
Meanwhile, John Bishop, the 39-year-old in charge of treasury and bullion,
is a mechanical engineer from University College, London. He spent two years
with Babcock &amp; Wilcox before joining Rothschilds in 1977, where he has spent
his entire career on the treasury side.
Treasury was the only division not represented at managing director level.
The other mds are Tony Alt, heading up the capital markets side, Bernard
Myers in charge of international and David Sullivan running the banking
division.
The bank denies that this round of promotions holds any wider significance
in terms of flagging an heir apparent. 'There are plenty of family members
around,' says a spokesman, referring to David de Rothschild, deputy chairman
under Sir Evelyn de Rothschild, and Amschel Rothschild, recently elevated to
executive chairman of Rothschild Asset Management.

FT  19 JUL 93 / Economics: Figures should confirm recovery
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THIS week should bring statistical confirmation that the UK economic
recovery is progressing well, while industrial production in France and
Italy continues to fall.
Provisional GDP figures on Friday are expected to show that British economy
grew at an annual rate of about 1.5 per cent in the three months from March
to the end of June. Analysts have been steadily upgrading their forecasts
for GDP this year, with the Treasury's latest survey of independent
economists indicating real growth of 1.6 per cent in 1993 and 2.6 per cent
next year.
Although official figures give only a partial insight into the UK's trading
performance (the June figures for trade with non-EC countries are out on
Wednesday), all the signs are that Britain is experiencing a well balanced
recovery.
Figures last week showed manufacturing output growing strongly, led by
investment goods production. At the same time, unemployment has fallen
further while inflationary pressures are subdued.
This week's figures are expected to confirm that consumer demand continues
to grow modestly, with only a gradual pick-up of bank and building society
lending. Such a recovery may not win many votes - in fact it may almost go
unnoticed by many people - but it offers the best chance of the UK enjoying
a sustained upturn while gradually reducing its current account balance of
payments deficit.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, should be able to give a generally upbeat
assessment of UK economic developments when he appears for the first time
before the Commons Treasury and Civil Service Committee on Wednesday
afternoon.
On the following day, the Maastricht Treaty faces a formidable parliamentary
hurdle in the UK when the Commons debates the social chapter and Labour
amendments to government policy.
Elsewhere, attention will be focused on German money supply. The Bundesbank
is expected to announce the June data early in the week. If M3 growth lies
within the 4.5 per cent to 6.5 per cent target range, it will encourage
hopes of further interest rate cuts in Germany that could ease the strains
in the European Monetary System.
The following are some of the week's economic highlights and events. The
figures in brackets are the median of economists' forecasts from MMS
International, a financial information company.
Today: Germany, Mr Kenneth Clarke, UK chancellor, visits the Bundesbank and
speaks about UK competitiveness in Munich. Japan, June money supply (M2 and
CD up 1.3 per cent on year). Canada, May wage settlements (1 per cent).
Sweden June unemployment (10 per cent).
Tomorrow: UK, June CBI distributive trade survey, building society
commitments (Pounds 2.9bn), M4 (up 0.4 per cent on month, 3.9 per cent on
year), M4 lending (Pounds 1.8bn). US, June housing starts (1.25m), building
permits, Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan delivers Humphrey-Hawkins testimony to
House Banking Committee. Japan, May leading diffusion index, coincident
index. France, May industrial production (down 0.2 per cent). Canada, June
construction wage index (down 0.1 per cent).
Wednesday: UK, June retail sales (up 0.3 per cent on month, 2.5 per cent on
the year), trade with non-EC countries (Pounds 850m deficit), May
construction orders.
Thursday: UK, British chambers of commerce quarterly business survey;
provisional vehicle output. US, June Treasury budget (Dollars 9bn surplus);
money supply week ended July 12 (M2 Dollars 4.7bn); initial claims week
ended July 17 (337,000); Alan Greenspan gives Humphrey-Hawkins testimony to
the Senate. Canada, May retail sales (up adjusted 0.2 per cent on month).
Friday: UK, preliminary second quarter GDP (up 0.5 per cent on quarter, 1.5
per cent on year). US, auto sales July 11 to 20 (6.8m).
During the week: Germany, June M3 from fourth quarter base (6.5 per cent),
West German producer prices (flat on month, down 0.4 per cent on year).
Italy, may industrial production (down 4.2 per cent on year); June M2 (up an
annual 6.1 per cent), bank lending (up an annual 5 per cent); July consumer
prices in cities (up 4.3 per cent on year). Japan, Bank of Japan quarterly
economic outlook. Finland, June trade balance.

FT  19 JUL 93 / The Week Ahead: SmithKline expected to be 10% ahead
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
RESULTS DUE
SmithKline Beecham, the Anglo-American healthcare group, reports its second
quarter results on Tuesday.
Analysts are expecting a 10 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds 280m,
excluding any one-time exceptional items such as disposals to Wella and Sara
Lee.
The dividend is likely to be unchanged.
Sales are expected to be up by about 25 per cent in the pharmaceuticals
division and the group.
Both figures will be assisted by currencies. Analysts will be looking for
strong growth from Engerix-B, the hepatitis B vaccine, Seroxat, an
anti-depressant, Kytril, an anti-nausea treatment.
Relafen, the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory for arthritis, and Augmentin,
an anti-biotic. The latter may overtake SB's anti-ulcer treatment Tagamet as
the company's most important drug.
The impact of the healthcare reforms in Germany and Italy will be carefully
monitored, as will the company's progress in the increasingly competitive US
market.
Waste Management International is expected to report on Monday interim
pre-tax profits of between Pounds 75m and Pounds 80m against Pounds 62.5m a
year earlier.
The company, floated by its US parent Waste Management which retain majority
control, has benefited from its joint venture with Wessex Water in the UK
and from expanding business in the Far East and Pacific Rim countries.
Full year profits for the year ending December are forecast at about Pounds
180m (Pounds 144m).
First Technology, a maker of crash dummies and security equipment for the
car industry, is forecast to turn in a big increase in pre-tax profits to
about Pounds 2m from (Pounds 0.6m) for the year to April.

FT  19 JUL 93 / Management: Delegate and rule - In a new series on
Euromanagers Viktor Korovin of Uralmash in Russia, talks to Leyla Boulton
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEYLA BOULTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS HEAD of the regional Communist Youth League nine years ago, Viktor
Korovin incurred the wrath of Boris Yeltsin. His offence was to have sent
his deputy to a meeting with the man who was then regional Communist Party
boss. As chief executive of newly-privatised Uralmash, Russia's biggest
heavy engineering company, the 40-year-old Korovin still believes it is 'to
a leader's credit if he has a deputy who can replace him'.
Delegating responsibility is a key component of his strategy for overhauling
a flagship of Stalin's industrialisation which last week celebrated its 60th
anniversary in President Yeltsin's home-town of Yekaterinburg.
The managerial challenge of adjusting to the chaotic market reforms sweeping
Russia are formidable. But if there is anyone capable of handling them, it
is Korovin, who has already displayed shrewd and energetic leadership since
taking on the top job at Uralmash (Urals Heavy Machine-Building Factory) 14
months ago.
Korovin's self-deprecating manner and boyish - almost scrawny - appearance
only thinly disguise a relentless workaholic.
Sitting in a spartan office overlooking the railway that criss-crosses the
Uralmash factory, he says human challenges outweigh by far the severe
problems of worn-out plant and equipment, financial crisis and government
interference.
His workforce has been reduced from 38,000 to 29,000 since he took over,
with 5,000 leaving of their own accord and 4,000 made redundant. The
administrative staff have been put on a four-day week and the level of
activity at the plant is a shadow of what it was under the old state
planning system when, as he puts it, 'demand for our products was
artificially high'. Further job cuts will 'depend on our success in the
market'.
Since he was elected to run Uralmash in a contest with four other
candidates, he has appointed like-minded men of his generation as directors
for marketing, personnel, production and finance. He has given them full
responsibility and freedom, dumping the highly-centralised system that
continues to exist within most enterprises in the former Soviet Union.
'Russians are in no way inferior to Germans or Italians,' says Korovin, who
worked for an engineering company outside Frankfurt in 1990, and then headed
Uralmash's joint venture with Austria's Voest-Alpine.
'The only difference was that the economic framework in which people have
worked has been all wrong. My task is to change this, and then you can
really expect miracles from people.'
In an attempt to compensate managers for pay that is demoralisingly low by
comparison with the fortunes being made by new entrepreneurs, options on 5
per cent of Uralmash stock have been set aside for them. Korovin's salary,
set when he was appointed at 5.6 times the prevailing average wage at
Uralmash, is equivalent to Dollars 200 (Pounds 134) a month.
In a move to improve shop-floor incentives, he plans to give the different
sections of the under-used plant enough autonomy to take on additional
contracts and use the profits as they wish 'to re-equip, expand, or even
increase wages'.
Even though he claims not to enjoy it, he says the recipe for earning the
respect of a workforce at large gatherings is to 'talk very sharply,
crudely, even shouting at times'. Faced with constant strike threats over
low pay, his reply has been 'go ahead and strike, your pay will be even
smaller'.
To cope with theft of factory materials he has set up a security force to
patrol the 5sq km plant. There is little else he can do when his low-paid
workers have even managed to smuggle out copper through the plant's sewage
system.
Notwithstanding his enthusiasm for delegation, Korovin is a man who is
capable of leading from the front.
In his fight for new markets to replace dwindling state procurement orders,
he last winter led a consortium of Russian companies which fought for and
won a contract to supply mining and transport equipment to Russia's Dollars
1bn Udokan copper development project. He is now looking to expand exports
of mining equipment to China and is trying to latch on to a variety of
mining and oil projects within Russia.
Most factory managers in Russia jump at the chance to visit the US on a
business trip. But Korovin has left Uralmash's finance director in charge of
negotiations with the US groups Caterpillar and National Oil Well for a
joint venture in the production and marketing of oil drilling equipment.
Rather than run to the government for wage and other subsidies, as some
privatised companies are continuing to do, Korovin is pushing for the state
to take on the financing of the cheap housing, kindergartens and other
services that Uralmash provides. Korovin is desperate to shed these
non-productive assets which he says amount to an invisible 30 per cent tax
on profits. He has stopped building housing for workers, even though it has
long been the tradition that staff receive their own apartment after 10
years service.
At the root of the efforts to keep down costs is a desperate desire to save
jobs and avoid what he calls a 'social explosion'. As Kakha Bendukidze, a
wealthy entrepreneur who bought 18.5 per cent of Uralmash shares says, there
is a 'need to stop unemployed workers from smashing up the plant'.
Korovin says the government's biggest mistake is failing to create jobs and
he criticises politicians for interfering with his new freedom. One example
is the finance ministry instructions telling him to launch a capital
increase. Korovin insists it should be his responsibility to decide the
terms and the timing, even if the government still has 20 per cent of the
equity.
Instead of trying to micro manage companies the government should get on
with its job of removing market distortions.
'There is demand for our equipment but the crisis is structural. Our
customers - steel companies and coal enterprises, for example - have
capacity which must die. But they're trying to maintain everything and
that's why we are not being paid.'
Those customers that have money have insufficient incentives to re-equip.
'Stop piling up your money,' is his sales pitch to them. 'It's time to start
buying equipment otherwise you're bad managers and any decent capitalist
will wipe you out.'
Motivated by the same ambition and energy which propelled him to the top of
the old Communist system even though he now believes in a completely
different ideology, he works 14 hours a day, six days a week. 'I know that's
bad,' he says, as he chain-smokes his way through a packet of Marlboro
cigarettes. 'It's much better to be fresh for the next day. But all I have
time for is to sleep a little and spend Sunday with my family.'

FT  19 JUL 93 / Management: A risky exercise at the BBC - John Birt's
dilemma
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER LORENZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Leaders who try to achieve radical change in their organisations almost
always face vilification at the outset. They are denounced with especial
venom if most of their employees can see no external crisis, and so no great
need for change. They are cursed to the rooftops if they try to enforce it
by dictating new ways of working, rather than by first creating a broad and
deep consensus on what needs to be done.
This phenomenon has plagued a string of tough-guy business leaders who have
taken their organisations by the scruff of the neck over the past decade and
tried to haul them screaming into the world of late 20th century management.
Consider, above all, Jack Welch of US General Electric. Since the late 1980s
he has been recognised for what he is - one of the most effective
transformational leaders of our age. Starting brutally in 1981, he yanked GE
out of its illustrious, but over-confident past and turned it into one of
the few large US corporations which has a decent global market share in many
of its businesses.
Six years ago much of his organisation still spat blood at him. 'Mad Jack'
and 'management by fear' were just two of the politer epithets about his
style which echoed around GE - and outside it. But he then mended matters by
showing he had learned the need to accompany 'hard' change (or follow it)
with 'softer' measures to change the corporate culture.
These included several continuous education initiatives, and also a highly
participative 'workout' programme of removing needless rules and work
procedures. GE is now home to some very far-reaching employee 'empowerment'
successes. Other companies have learned from its experience, accelerating
their change processes - and defusing early opposition - by introducing
'hard' and 'soft' initiatives in parallel.
If Welch has listened to US Public Service Broadcasting (PBS) over the past
week, or perused the British press - which he does often - he will feel some
sympathy for an equally high-profile UK chief executive who has now landed
himself in a similar position, attracting complaints of 'Stalinism'.
But Welch's sympathy will be limited, because his counterpart is a less
effective leader and his problems are partly self-made.
The man in question is John Birt, who seven months ago took over as
director-general of Britain's nearest equivalent to PBS, the British
Broadcasting Corporation.
For the benefit of readers who are not fixated by the regular spate of
storms at the BBC, a summary of Birt's situation is required. He is trying
to achieve something far harder than the loosening-up exercise which Welch
performed on an over-controlled GE: Birt has to create a tightly managed
enterprise out of a loose, public-sector collection of fiefdoms which have
thrived in creative terms for decades - but with manifest financial waste -
beneath an ineffective, committee-ridden bureaucracy.
Behind this attempted revolution lies Birt's twofold mission: to ensure that
a traditionally hostile government is so struck by the BBC's sudden surge in
cost-effectiveness that it renews its charter in 1996, together with its
prime source of financing, a licence fee levied on every TV user; and to
shore up the BBC's market share against an ever-rising flood of rival TV and
radio stations.
Birt's prime method of change has been to force through the creation of an
(over-fragmented) internal market through a procedure called 'producer
choice'. This is an unfortunate term for what is, in effect, a cost control
mechanism.
If Birt were to ask Welch for advice on his predicament, he would receive
some tough-talking - not about what he is trying to achieve, but about how.
For Birt has made a series of mistakes which are fundamental to the
(mis)management of change. Some spring from his uncommunicative and
uninspiring public persona - an utter contrast with Welch and other
successful 'change masters'. Other errors flow from the advice he has been
given by some of the accountancy-based management consultancies on which he
has relied to an excessive extent.
Most fundamentally, he is failing to apply properly modern US and European
experience of how to lead transformational change. In the UK, all sorts of
private and public sector organisations, from BP and ICI to hospitals
schools and even a few local authorities, are achieving uncomfortable change
by setting a top-down direction, and then stimulating the enthusiasm,
participation and initiative of their staff. Birt did help spark a year-long
consultation exercise before he took over, but it has failed to create much
consensus.
Nowhere was this more evident last week than in a newspaper article by one
of his top advisers, David Hatch, which reeked with language about 'we' and
'them' (as in 'we will tell them. . .' and 'their lack of uncertainty about
our objectives' - my italics). It is hard to imagine a less effective way of
preparing the ground for the sort of 'ownership' or 'buy-in' which any
programme of change must create if it is to succeed.
That is done not by diktat and cursory 'sheep dip' re-training for staff,
but - as at BP - by co-opting change agents among existing employees at all
levels, and inspiring rather than ordering them to enthuse their own
colleagues in turn. For this to work, open debate must be encouraged; it can
be discreetly 'facilitated' and kept within bounds.
If all this has proved necessary to accomplish change in multinational
machine bureaucracies, it is even more vital in a creative 'know-how'
organisation such as the BBC. Birt's apparent failure to recognise this so
far - or to apply it effectively - has contributed heavily to the very poor
state of staff morale which was all too evident in the employee attitudes
survey published on Friday.
Birt and his advisers have also shown poor judgment on two other counts: his
special personal salary arrangements, and those of other top staff; and last
week's seeming shift of the BBC's business strategy away from Birt's initial
up-market focus - a shift he then denied.
Some employees will always resist change. But for most to 'buy-in' to it,
they need faith in their leader as an individual and in his strategic
vision.
Welch built both in spades. Birt's lack of them could yet be his undoing.

FT  19 JUL 93 / Survey of Corporate Finance (13): Structural reform gathers
pace / Assessing the capitalist revolution in eastern Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FINANCING the transition from central planning to privatised market
economies is all about creating capitalism without capital. Not surprisingly
this unprecedented task has spawned some unprecedented 'solutions', not all
of them very healthy.
A recent study by Salomon Brothers of New York, for example, found that
mutual default on payments between enterprises was the main source of
financing economic activity in Russia during the first half of 1992.
According to the June edition of Salomon's Russian Economic Issues,
inter-enterprise debt rose 82-fold from Rbs39bn on January 1 to Rbs3,200bn
on July 1 last year.
This uncontrolled explosion of funny money made a mockery of attempts to
moderate inflation and obliged the government to permit the central bank to
issue a surge of new money or face the consequences of forcing 90 per cent
of industry and the financial sector into bankruptcy.
But the decision to print more money did nothing to help the grass-roots
transformation of the economy which is taking place, but virtually in spite
of government actions. Nearly half the new credits were used to prop up the
discredited collective farm and agro-industrial sector and much of the
remainder to sustain the military factories, the study concluded.
The growth of unregulated inter-enterprise debt is a problem throughout the
former communist bloc and will remain so until a combination of bank reform,
bankruptcy legislation and privatisation, separates out the hopeless loss
makers from the basically sound enterprises which can be re-financed,
down-sized where necessary and re-floated.
But this process is gathering pace, starting with the three central European
states - Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic. These are the most advanced
along the path to privatisation and structural reform and the most
attractive to foreign investors. But similar moves, albeit at an earlier
stage, are also taking place in Bulgaria, Romania and the Baltic states.
Despite the low level of average incomes the past three years have seen a
widening of income differentials and a growth of personal savings which has
surprised most observers. After an initially hesitant start the mass
privatisation programmes pioneered by former Czechoslovakia and Poland have
also been enthusiastically received, turning millions of citizens into
small-scale shareholders at an initial cost of a few weeks' wages.
The foundations of a domestically-generated investment capability are thus
being laid. But increasingly, economic policy-makers and advisers are
emphasising the crucial importance of transforming primitive Soviet-style
banking systems into effective conduits for the finance of industry and
commerce. The central European states in particular are also forging ahead
with the development of pensions funds, insurance companies and other
institutional investors, hitherto totally lacking.
Much still has to be done on the banking front. But heavy investment in
personnel training and on new equipment and premises, coupled with much
foreign advice and extensive remodelling of banking laws on European
Community lines, is changing the face of what is becoming an increasingly
privatised and modernised sector.
Most banking business is still transacted by the big state-owned banks. But
many are earmarked for privatisation and dozens of smaller private banks,
unburdened by the bad debts of the past, have sprung up, although most
remain small and under-capitalised.
The World Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development
(EBRD) have singled out the banking system as a priority for reform
throughout the region, with both helping various schemes to re-finance
balance sheets stripped of inherited bad debts.
The EBRD, for example, recently took a 28 per cent stake in Poland's
Wielkopolski Bank Kreditowy, the first of nine hitherto state-owned
commercial banks hived off from the central bank three years ago to form the
basis of a new, private, commercial banking system.
The much-criticised EBRD has been most active in Poland where more than 100
investment projects are in the pipeline. Most are for fledgling Polish
private companies unable to obtain finance for expansion from the banks,
although the bank's earliest operations throughout the region concentrated
on co-financing deals involving foreign investors with track-records and
wide experience in funding matters.
After a slow start the pace of foreign investment in the region is climbing
steadily, although this complicated area, artificially cut off from the real
world of financial and capital markets for decades, is having to compete
against fast-growing Latin America and south-east Asia where market
mechanisms already exist and where returns are usually quicker.
Foreign investment commitments totalling Dollars 28bn were chalked up last
year, although that figure, compiled by East Europe Investment Magazine, is
somewhat artificially boosted by large, long-term energy projects in
Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan and a few mega-investments such as Volkswagen's
DM7bn commitment to Skoda in the Czech Republic and Fiat's Dollars 2bn
project in Poland. Strip out the energy deals, where spending will be over
decades, and the actual equity capital inflow to the region since the fall
of communism is Dollars 10-Dollars 12bn.
Investors have learned to distinguish between the former Soviet states, with
the partial exception of the Baltic states and Kazakhstan, and former
communist central Europe. Russia and most of the former Soviet states are
for patient, long-term investors willing to ride with the punches and
re-invest rouble profits for long-term growth and market penetration.
Central Europe on the other hand is already well on the way to developing
fully-fledged market economies with relatively stable political structures
and western-style legal systems.
Hungary, which began market reforms 20 years ago and punctiliously services
its large foreign debt, remains the favourite target for foreign investment,
attracting more than Dollars 5bn since 1989. Earlier this year it pulled off
a significant coup when Audi-VW decided to locate its new engine plant in
Hungary rather than former east Germany. But Poland, with its large internal
market growth potential and entrepreneurial ways, is rapidly emerging as a
potential 'Italy on the Baltic', with a fast-growing private sector
shrugging off occasional political turbulence like post-war Italy.
Big German investment in the Czech Republic, spearheaded by Volkswagen, has
brought a wide spread of collateral investments by component companies and
similar developments are taking place in Hungary, where Suzuki is a rare
Japanese investor, and Poland where Fiat's commitment is also drawing in
substantial collateral investment.
Heavy investment by the multinational car companies seeking low cost
production facilities and potential market growth is mirrored by a wide
spread of multinational consumer goods corporations. They are bringing the
joys of western-style detergents, tobacco, processed food and drink to the
whole of central and south-east Europe, with the exception of war-torn
former Yugoslavia which faces economic meltdown if the ethnic conflicts are
not resolved.

FT  19 JUL 93 / Survey of Corporate Finance (14): Patriotism seems to pay -
Hong Kong businesses are expanding their investments in the colony
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE departure of flagships Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Banking Corporation and
Jardine Matheson before the Chinese assume sovereignty in 1997 appears to
symbolise the international image of corporate Hong Kong, but the reality
could not be more different.
Far from struggling to lower their exposure to Hong Kong, most of the
colony's businesses are expanding their investment portfolios in Hong Kong
and in the land of its future masters.
When Britain and China signed a joint declaration sealing the fate of Hong
Kong as a future Chinese territory, a corporate exodus was widely expected.
Jardine Matheson seemed to set a trend in 1984, when it moved its domicile
to Bermuda, tacitly implying a lack of confidence in the post-1997
administration. It looked as if other companies might restructure asset
portfolios in favour of safer havens, such as North America and Europe.
Indeed, some companies have dabbled overseas in property developments in
Canada, California and Australia. But the track record of Hong Kong
investors who have moved outside the cosy borders of the colony has been
extremely poor, while those who stayed have prospered.
Mr Stephen Clark, director of Anglo Chinese, a local corporate finance
house, says there will be no external flood of capital. 'If there was going
to be a move for the door, it would have already happened,' he says.
One of the only Chinese conglomerates to make a significant push outside
Asia is Mr Li Ka-shing's Hutchison Whampoa. In 1987 it purchased a 43 per
cent stake in Canadian oil and gas producer Husky Oil - the investment was
split between Hutchison and its associate Hongkong Electric. It followed
this with the expansion of its telecommunications business into the UK in
the early 1990s.
Husky contributed write-offs of Dollars HK2.2bn for Hutchison in its 1991
and 1992 accounts. And if its UK telecommunications operations are for sale,
as is believed, enormous losses would result.
Warburg Securities estimates that these two investments will reduce earnings
between 1988 and 1995 by Dollars HK4.5bn, even assuming there are no
provisions against the telecommunications business.
There was little surprise, therefore, when Mr Li announced last year that
Hutchison would refocus its attention on Hong Kong and China.
Hong Kong Chinese companies have long understood that those who cash in Hong
Kong businesses to pay for overseas investments will be deemed unpatriotic
and unsuitable for favourable treatment by a post-1997 regime.
Expectations of asset disposals have therefore focused on the four main
expatriate-managed companies, Jardine Matheson, HSBC, Swire Pacific and
Hongkong Telecom (HKT).
Mr Stephen Brown, research director of Asia Equity, says: 'Only two of the
British-style Hong Kong companies have decided not to play the
decolonisation game, and have instead diversified overseas through
acquisitions.'
HSBC has finalised its long-awaited takeover of Midland and its move into
the international banking arena. Jardine, meanwhile, has completed its
restructuring as a primarily a London listed company: recent expansion has
focused on the UK, through Trafalgar House, and Singapore, through Cycle &amp;
Carriage.
Jardine Matheson has been publicly condemned for what is perceived as its
lack of confidence in the future of the Hong Kong special administrative
region. By contrast, its competitors have made every effort to build up
their Chinese guanxi or connections.
Swire Pacific and HKT have recognised the changing environment by offering
shares to China International Trust and Investment Corporation (Citic), the
local offshoot of the Beijing investment corporation. Citic Pacific, the
largest China-controlled listing in Hong Kong, now holds 12.5 per cent of
Swire's airline Cathay Pacific and 12 per cent of HKT.
At the same time, Swire and HKT have expanded their operations across the
border into China. Swire Properties has cemented the relationship by
launching a HKDollars 2.85bn property development with Citic.
Hong Kong offers investors a high growth economy and a cosy, tight-knit
business community. Insiders start with a significant advantage, but this is
not transferable.
Most overseas investments have been mere extensions of a domestic strategy.
In 1988 and 1989, for example, Regal Hotels, New World Hotels and Wharf
Holdings each purchased US groups - Aircoa, Ramada and Omni respectively.
The total cost of these hotel investments was USDollars 535m, and while all
were expected to benefit from existing operations, they have proved to be
ill-timed purchases.
Dickson Poon's more recent HKDollars 750m purchase of Harvey Nichols was
also a strategic decision to acquire another brand name for Dickson
Concepts' luxury goods distribution business, rather than just a real estate
gamble.
These investments pale by comparison with the level of capital flows between
Hong Kong and neighbouring Guangdong province. Mainland Chinese investors
have made substantial inroads into the Hong Kong property and stock markets.
Over the next year, nine mainland registered state enterprises will be
floated on the Hong Kong stock market, further emphasising the link.
In the other direction, Credit Lyonnais Securities estimates that the
average Hong Kong listed company has made two investments in China, and the
aggregate value of these projects (including the investment by the joint
venture partner) amounts to HKDollars 521bn.
All the leading corporate finance houses now have China teams, pointing up
the irony of Jardine's lone push towards internationalisation, given its
historical background as the Princely Hong and pillar of the colony's
business community.
Jardine has had some overseas successes, notably through its supermarkets
subsidiary Dairy Farm - which has significant holdings in Kwik Save in the
UK and Franklins in Australia. Its stake in Trafalgar House is viewed by
many as another astute move.
But as the group's percentage of earnings from Hong Kong declines, so will
the level of its influence. China has already indicated the potential
problems this could cause, by setting obstacles to its proposed investment
in Container Terminal 9.

FT  19 JUL 93 / Survey of Corporate Finance (11): An empire in the setting
sun / Profile of Jardine Matheson
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PURGE of the board of Trafalgar House was completed recently, at the
behest of Mr Simon Keswick, chairman of Hongkong Land, a sister company of
Jardine Matheson.
Mr Keswick, who with his brother Henry in effect runs the Jardine Matheson
empire, became chairman and installed Hongkong Land's finance director, Mr
David Gawler, in the same position at Trafalgar.
Jardine Matheson is one of the last of the traditional expatriate-run Hong
Kong trading companies, whose assets range from hotels and offices in Hong
Kong to a controlling stake in the UK supermarket chain Kwik Save.
Those unfamiliar with the ways of the Keswicks could be forgiven for
thinking that Hongkong Land had just bought Trafalgar. But that is not how
Jardine Matheson does business.
In a dawn raid on October 1 1992, Hongkong Land took a 14.99 per cent stake
in Trafalgar and demanded boardroom representation. Trafalgar reacted by
bringing forward some of its management changes.
But Hongkong Land tightened its grip by gradually taking its stake up to 25
per cent and had two of its directors, Mr Rodney Leach and Sir Charles
Powell, appointed as non-executives.
Hongkong Land considered having Sir Charles take over as chairman but
decided instead on Mr Keswick.
Sir Nigel Broackes, former chairman and founder of the group, described
Hongkong Land's decision to take a stake in Trafalgar as 'trying to get
effective control without paying a bid premium'. He now believes it was for
the good.
Mr Leach, who is also a director of Jardine Matheson, said his group's
involvement in Trafalgar should not be seen as a prelude to making an
outright bid for the company.
'This is a long-term investment. We are not in the business of taking stakes
as a prelude to making bids. We do not take the cheap, expedient way. We are
interested in what the profits of Trafalgar will be in five years time.'
Since Hongkong Land has taken effective control of the group there is no
need to question Mr Leach's guarantee. This is born out by Hongkong Land's
involvement in Kwik Save.
Dairy Farm International, the food retailing arm of Hongkong's Jardine
Matheson group, recently increased its stake in Kwik Save to just over 28
per cent.
The UK supermarkets chain made record pre-tax profits of Pounds 110.5m in
1992.
In July 1987, Dairy Farm succeeded with its Pounds 147m partial tender offer
for a 25 per cent stake in Kwik Save.
Rowan Morgan, retailing analyst at Nikko Europe, says: 'Over the last five
years Kwik Save has produced the fastest earnings growth rate in the sector
with the exception of Argyll. The quality of growth has been high, based
upon strong like-for-like sales growth and organic store development rather
than being dependent upon boosting gross margins.'
Net gearing at the last balance sheet was a mere 2.2 per cent and the group
is effectively ungeared. The Jardine Matheson empire may have hit on a
controversial method of taking control of companies but if it continues to
produce the sort of results unveiled at Kwik Save it is unlikely to be
stopped.

FT  19 JUL 93 / Survey of Corporate Finance (10): Scrip option plan has a
short shelf-life - An attempt to beat the taxman over ACT
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ability of Britain's corporate financiers to twist new financing
techniques to the disadvantage of the taxman is legendary. But the problem
of surplus Advance Corporation Tax for those with too low a corporate tax
bill to offset has had them stumped for years.
Thus, there was a certain frisson in the City when BAT Industries, long
dogged by unrecoverable ACT, announced its advisers had come up with a plan
to tackle it. The plan, advanced by Barclays de Zoete Wedd, seemed simple.
BAT would offer to pay its shareholders their usual dividend in cash,
incurring ACT on all those payments. But those who elected to take their
dividends in shares, which do not attract ACT, could earn a dividend worth
up to 50 per cent more. From the deal, BAT would save Pounds 97m in ACT
charges and another Pounds 334.7m assuming that all shareholders took scrip
instead of cash.
Even better, BZW told shareholders that they could achieve the best of both
worlds, getting cash worth almost 50 per cent more than the dividend. BZW
would operate a kind of resale facility, offering to buy - at no dealing
cost - the extra shares at a discount to the market of only 5 per cent.
Shareholders who exercised the scrip option but then sold the extra share
allotment would still be better off than those who chose the initial
ACT-attracting cash dividend.
So attractive was the technique that seven other big UK companies quickly
announced plans for similar techniques. But then, things began to go sour.
Just why they did so is a complicated story but ultimately, BZW
acknowledges, enhanced scrip dividends are a virtuous product with a
regrettably short shelf-life.
Mr Amir Eilon, managing director, corporate finance, at BZW and one of the
architects of the structure, says the group began to think of ways to help
companies around the problem of surplus ACT in 1991. Initially, BZW toyed
with the idea of issuing A and B class shares, one of which would attract
ACT and the other not. But previous experiments with that structure, along
with the general distaste among investors for different classes of shares,
led it to abandon that route.
The enhanced scrip dividend structure, he says, is blindingly simple by
comparison.
The problem with scrip dividends is that shareholders do not like them. In
Britain, tax-exempt institutions such as pension funds find them
unattractive because they are able to reclaim 20 per cent of the ACT paid by
the company, so that the return on a cash dividend is even higher than it
appears. Thus, scrip dividends have a traditionally low take-up of under 5
per cent.
The sheer volume of the BAT offer made it attractive to the institutions and
overcame their initial distaste for new share certificates.
But after the initial euphoria, doubts began to creep in. The Association of
British Insurers, one of the UK's most influential shareholder groups, said
it was concerned about them. 'These are like ice-cream,' says a member of
the ABI's investment committee. 'They glisten at first but after they've sat
in the sun for a while they don't look so good.'
The ABI view is that, as a one-off arrangement to avoid unrecoverable ACT,
the use of enhanced scrip dividends is to be welcomed. But by next year, its
use should become obsolete because the Treasury has already promised to
introduce foreign income dividends. These will help companies with foreign
profits to pay dividends out of those profits without incurring an ACT
charge.
However, the ABI is worried that companies will issue them repeatedly, in
effect turning them into a rolling rights issue. A significant expansion in
the number of outstanding shares raises questions about a company's ability
to finance them.
After all, extra shares over time may force companies either to restrain
their dividend increases or, worse, to cut pay-outs on each share. But BZW
says that companies need only earn a 15 per cent return on capital to ensure
that the dividend stream is maintained.
Shareholders are also concerned that the use of scrip could evolve into a
kind of 'fudge' for companies which are short of the cash necessary to pay
the dividend, but are unwilling to say so publicly. Among the companies
which issued enhanced scrip dividends was Forte, which also announced a cut
in its dividend.
'If I want a company's shares I'll go out and buy them,' says Ms Caroline
Burton, director of investment management at Guardian Royal Exchange. 'In
the meantime, I'd like my dividend in cash, thank you very much.'
However, the greatest controversy over enhanced scrip dividends is not over
their efficacy but about the profits to be derived from advising companies
on their use.
Swiss Bank Corporation caused a commotion when it saidit would repurchase
extra shares issued as dividends by BAT at a discount of only 2 per cent to
market price, undercutting BZW's 5 per cent discount.
SBC said it could offer a smaller discount after applying an options model
analysis to the offering and realising that the risk to the buyer justified
a much lower fee. In defence of the wider discount it had sought initially,
BZW said that, at the time, it had no idea what the take-up of the enhanced
scrip would be and therefore, it judged the risks to be greater. SBC, it
said, made its price offer with the benefit of hindsight.

FT  19 JUL 93 / Survey of Corporate Finance (12): Venture that went adrift /
Profile of 3i
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Wanted. New owner for Europe's largest venture capital company. Slightly
shopsoiled from standing in the display window for the past two years but
still a basically sound business.
WHAT is to happen to 3i, the grandfather of the British venture capital
industry, after its clumsy attempts at a public flotation? Continuing
uncertainty about the future of the largest provider in Europe - let alone
in Britain - of equity and long-term loan finance to small businesses is a
cause of some concern.
The repeated postponement of the planned flotation has dented the company's
image and done little for staff morale. More important, small and
medium-sized companies desperate to raise extra funds to finance growth may
find that a key player is distracted from its primary business.
3i's problems came to a head in April when the banks which are its present
shareholders announced an indefinite postponement of the flotation.
Apparently prompted by a change of heart by Barclays and National
Westminster Bank, which together own 41 per cent of 3i, shareholders said
they would wait until the economy improved.
Mr Alan Wheatley, a former senior partner of accountants Price Waterhouse
brought in as chairman to spearhead the flotation, stepped down.
There are now three main options open to 3i and its shareholders. They
could:
Maintain the status quo. Pressure is off the banks, particularly Midland
which is now part of HBSC Holdings, to raise funds by disposing of their
stakes.
But while the banks might not be so desperate to raise money by the sale of
3i, the company itself is keen to top up its finances. It had planned to
raise new money at the time of the flotation and is currently testing the
market to see if it could raise a Dollars 300m-Dollars 400m fund.
This would, however, leave a fundamental problem unresolved: the big banks
all have their own competing venture capital activities. In recent years 3i,
like the rest of the venture capital industry, has shifted its emphasis to
larger deals, bringing it into direct competition with the bank-owned
venture funds. If 3i re-emphasised its focus on smaller deals, its
shareholders would not complain.
Allow one of the banks, or another financial institution, to buy 3i.
National Westminster is believed to have expressed an interest at one stage
while 3i recently considered the possibility of a link-up with Charterhouse
Development Capital. But the banks would be unwilling to see the fruits of
3i's long-term investment activities fall into the hands of a rival.
Allow a large pension fund investor or group of investors to acquire 3i. For
most, this would represent no conflict of interest with existing activities
and it should not provoke the jealousy a bank sale would. However, the poor
returns from some of their investments have made pension funds cautious
about venture capital investments over the past two years and there might
not be many takers.
3i is in an unhappy position for a company which depends on making long-term
investments. While uncertainty about the flotation persists, attention will
focus on its own short-term prospects.

FT  19 JUL 93 / Survey of Corporate Finance (7): Capital idea ready to
launch - Lloyd's prepares to take on a new character
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LLOYD'S OF LONDON will finalise its plans to attract corporate investment
later this month, signalling an important shift in the character of the
305-year-old insurance market. Lloyd's leaders believe that an influx of
fresh capital from institutional investors, insurance companies and
individuals is essential if the market's recent losses are not to be
followed by shrinkage and possible break-up. But in spite of some
encouraging recent signs, the success of the efforts to attract new money is
far from certain.
Lloyd's initially agreed to invite corporate investors to join the market in
January last year, when the council, or governing body, accepted the
recommendations of a market task force, headed by the present chairman,
David Rowland. The discovery in the spring of 1992 that the entry of new
'incorporated Names' would not require any amendment to the 1982 Lloyd's
Act, which sets out the market's self-governing status, led the council to
step up its preliminary work. And in April this year Lloyd's announced the
basic rules for corporate participation as part of its new business plan.
Underpinning all these developments has been a realisation that Lloyd's
cannot now hope to sustain - let alone expand - its existing capital base by
relying on the individual members or Names, who have traditionally supported
underwriting with their personal wealth.
Lloyd's losses in the past five years amount to more than Pounds 6.5bn and
have left several thousand Names facing the prospect of financial ruin.
Since 1989 more than 13,000 Names have been forced either to resign or cease
underwriting, reducing overall capacity from Pounds 11.1bn in 1990 to Pounds
8.7bn in 1993. More than 2,000 Names have applied to the market's hardship
relief scheme, under which Lloyd's reschedules their debts and allows Names
a modest income and home. Worse still the average age of the 19,770 Names
who continue to trade at the market is more than 55.
'Anno Domini and our losses mean that we are an eroding asset,' says Mr
David James, a Name and leading businessman who joined the council last
year. 'There is not going to be a new flood of Names. We can only come
through this morass if we attract new capital. The reality is we must expect
further erosion. If we cannot replace that we are in some trouble.' Further
impetus for the move to corporate capital is coming from Lloyd's agencies -
which handle the affairs of individual Names and manage syndicates. With
more than 17,000 Names either contemplating or taking legal action, agents
are anxious to attract more stable investors.
In its business plan Lloyd's announced that corporate investors would be
asked to deposit 1.5 per cent of their stamp capacity (the amount of premium
they are allowed to accept according to Lloyd's rules) in 1994 and pay a
subsequent annual fee equal to 0.5 per cent of stamp. 'Incorporated Names'
must also deposit 50 per cent of their stamp with Lloyd's to underwrite
(compared to between 20 per cent and 30 per cent for individual Names).
Lloyd's aims to achieve average underwriting returns of 10 per cent per year
would therefore guarantee corporate investors a pre-tax return of 20 per
cent from underwriting. Coupled with investment income of some 7 per cent
incorporated Names could hope to achieve pre-tax returns of up to 27 per
cent, the business plan says.
Already the prospect of these returns has attracted a number of investment
bankers to work on corporate capital projects. Late last year two banks - JP
Morgan of the US and SG Warburg, of the UK - agreed to advise Lloyd's on its
plans. Other financial institutions such as James Capel, BZW Securities,
Salomon Brothers and Phoenix Securities, a niche securities house active in
the international insurance market, are exploring a series of initiatives.
Marsh McLennan, Johnson &amp; Higgins, Sedgwick Group and other insurance
brokers, which have a detailed knowledge of the quality of the syndicates
active at Lloyd's, are working with the banks on developingthese schemes.
Among the most developed are: Morgan and Marsh teamed up in developing a
Dollars 70m Bermuda-based company which will provide quota share reinsurance
on an exclusive basis to syndicates managed by the Merrett Group at Lloyd's,
one of the biggest of the Lloyd's managing agencies. Mr Dennis Purkiss,
chief executive of Merrett, says the new company could eventually become an
'incorporated Name' at Lloyd's in its own right.
CLM, a subsidiary of Sedgwick, the insurance broker, has teamed up with BZW
to launch a Pounds 200-300m investment company, which would be listed on the
stock exchange and participate in Lloyd's through up to six subsidiaries,
each of which would become incorporated Names. While the company would be
based in London and eventually listed on the stock market, the subsidiaries
could be licensed as insurers in Bermuda, where both the tax and regulatory
environment is gentler. BZW is marketing the company among individual and
corporate investors and hopes to launch it by the autumn.
Phoenix Securities is working with Anton agency at Lloyd's in the
development of various vehicles, while Salomon Brothers has linked up with
Johnson &amp; Higgins. Marsh McLennan and J P Morgan have launched a Dollars 1bn
investment fund, a portion of which could be directed to the Lloyd's market.
Two main questions cast a shadow over all these schemes.
Lloyd's has still to convince investors that a plan to isolate billions of
dollars of potential liabilities from US pollution and asbestosis will be
effective.
The proposal to 'ring fence' these liabilities by transferring all policies
underwritten by Lloyd's syndicates in 1985 and all earlier years to a new
reinsurance company, NewCo, formed an important part of the business plan.
Lloyd's admits though that the scheme is highly ambitious and is dependent
on months of painstaking efforts by market officials. More importantly,
Lloyd's is coming under pressure from groups of loss-making Names to modify
the terms on which corporate capital can join Lloyd's.
The rebels argue that corporate investors must pay a higher joining fee or
contribute part of their future profits to a fund, which would be used to
help pay the losses of Names badly hit by recent losses.
The issue figured prominently at an extraordinary general meeting in July
and will be an important part of a confidence vote on which Names will vote
by early August. Mr David Rowland, chairman, is keeping his fingers crossed
that Names will vote against the rebel motions. Defeat would rule out the
introduction of new corporate investors at least in the medium term and
could seriously jeopardise the market's existence.

FT  19 JUL 93 / Survey of Corporate Finance (9): Loans that change their
spots - The secondary market in distressed corporate debt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RELATIONSHIPS between banks and big companies have become increasingly
fragile over the past few years.
Most banks have increasingly felt the need to pursue profit, which has had a
number of consequences, not all of them pleasant, for companies.
Banks have, for example, diversified into new businesses, such as investment
banking. It has been quite common for one of these new investment banking
subsidiaries to give advice to a bidder in a takeover battle whose target
has been one of the bank's own clients.
Needless to say, the client under attack is normally furious at what it sees
as a breach of trust - the bank's argument that the investment banking
subsidiary is acting as an independent entity, behind a 'Chinese Wall', cuts
no ice.
More recently, investment banking habits have been having an even more
profound effect on the relationship between banker and corporate client.
Investment bankers regard all assets in their balance sheets as tradeable.
Trading these assets is normally easy, because most of the assets are in the
form of securities.
However, only a relatively small proportion of the assets of most banks are
securities. Most of their balance sheets consist of loans, either to
companies or individuals, which have traditionally not been tradeable.
In the past, when a bank made a loan to a company or individual, it was in
effect contracting to maintain a relationship with the borrower till the
loan was repaid. But not any longer. Many banks now want to be able to sell
these loans.
The reason for this change is that the worldwide recession has left banks
with little spare capital. The ability to trade in loans allows a bank to
rapidly adjust the size of its balance sheet to a level best suited to its
capital resources.
Over the past decade, three different markets in banks' assets have grown
up. Two of these are now relatively well established: the market in bank
loans to less developed countries and the market in mortgages and consumer
loans, repackaged as securities, or securitised.
However, a third market is developing, the existence of which is having a
very profound effect on the traditional relationship between banks and their
corporate clients. This is a market in distressed corporate debt, or loans
to companies which are experiencing financial difficulties.
Until recently, when a company had financial problems, it would normally
expect to negotiate a debt restructuring with the bank or banks which had
originally granted its loans and which it felt it knew well.
However, a number of companies in difficulties have recently discovered  -
to their shock - that their banks have sold their loans to other financial
institutions. In the past year, this happened to WPP, the advertising group,
and to Isosceles, the supermarket operator.
Such sales can complicate the process of negotiating a debt restructuring,
because the buyers of the debt may need time to get to know the company and
understand its problems.
On the other hand, proponents of the new market argue that there can be a
benefit stemming from such debt sales. A company's original bankers may have
become so disenchanted with a troubled company that they will refuse to
grant any new credit to that company. A new institution may, however, be
rather less dogmatic.
The market developed first in the US five years ago. M J Whitman, one of the
leading brokers of such debt, estimates that distressed US corporate debt
with a face value - not to be confused with its sale value - of Dollars 5bn
was traded in 1992, double the level of the previous year.
'This year, between Dollars 5bn and Dollars 7bn is likely to be traded,'
said Mr Peter Lupoff, who is in charge of corporate debt trading at the
firm.
When trading first began, the sellers were typically branches of non-US
banks or smaller regional banks. They tended to sell their participations in
syndicated loans granted to those companies with which they did not have a
close relationship.
However, over the past year some of the biggest US banks, including
Citicorp, Wells Fargo and First Chicago, have started to make such sales,
particularly of loans to property companies.
'Some of the sellers in the past year were the agents for loans,' said Mr
Lupoff. In other words, banks have sold their interest in loans to companies
even when they knew the company quite well.
Citicorp has formally recognised that banks have now acquired a trading
psychology by producing an index of bank loans to companies, which in theory
allows banks to compare the return of making loans to companies with the
returns available from investing in securities.
The leading brokers in the debt, Whitman, Goldman Sachs and Oppenheimer, are
now trying to develop the market in the UK. There is also one new UK firm,
Klesch and Company, specialising in the market.
The UK market is still small. Like the US market in its early days, sellers
are often foreign banks with branches in London - and they have tended to
sell their debt participations in companies with which they do not have a
close relationship.
But there have been trades in the debt of several companies in difficulties,
including Maxwell Communications Corporation, Brent Walker, Isosceles, WPP,
Guinness Peat Aviation, Eurotunnel, Heron and Polly Peck.
UK banks say they are hesitant to enter this market - though most are
considering it. 'It is not something we would rule out,' said Lord
Alexander, chairman of National Westminster Bank, the UK's second biggest
bank.
An additional factor in the slow growth of the market has been that UK
investment institutions, unlike their US counterparts, have not yet emerged
as very enthusiastic buyers of the debt. However, they are being lobbied
intensively by the brokers.
One reason for believing that a UK market may eventually take off has been
the changing attitude of the Bank of England.
Its associate director, Mr Pen Kent, said in a speech last November that he
was concerned that selling the debt of a troubled company could impede
attempts to rescue it. 'Selling debt in response to news that a company is
in difficulty is not in keeping with one of the basic tenets of the London
Approach (which is a Bank of England sponsored code of conduct for banks
involved in rescuing a company).'
However. in June his tone had changed. He said that the sale of bank debt,
especially property loans, to new investors, had 'the potential for a
beneficial and productive effect for a company in difficulties'.
New investors might have expertise relevant to the company or might be able
to take a longer term view of the returns to be made from the debt than the
company's original bankers.
Much as companies may feel uneasy at the thought that they may not be able
to decide from which institution they borrow, the new market is probably
here to stay.

FT  19 JUL 93 / Survey of Corporate Finance (8): Banks re-think lending
policy - John Gapper considers the risks posed by small businesses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OF ALL sectors of corporate finance, lending to small and medium-sized
businesses faces the greatest uncertainties. British banks have been forced
into a fundamental re-think both of the terms on which they do such
business, and even whether they should be doing it at all.
While banks ponder their future in the market, smaller businesses are
themselves considering ways to avoid more exposure to loans after poor
experiences. Both sides are licking their wounds after a wave of company
failures that emerged as big provisions on bank balance sheets.
This sense of uncertainty is relatively new for small corporate finance.
Lending to the sector has appeared the last, best hope of many British banks
after the process of disintermediation of large corporate business which
flourished in the 1980s cut lending margins to wafer-thin levels.
In contrast to larger corporate lending margins of below 50 basis points -
or half a percentage point - small firms have been forced to obtain money at
up to 6.5 percentage points above base. This form of traditional bank
business logically offers the best hope of higher returns on capital.
Apart from the size of margin, small corporate lending also tends
automatically to attract other fee-earning business for which banks have to
press large companies. Fees for services such as clearing cheques not only
raise overall profits, but help to support the cost of branch networks.
However, the assumptions underlying much small corporate business have been
put in question by the experience of the last UK economic cycle. Banks
failed to assess the risks of lending in the over-heated economic surge of
the late 1980s, and were caught in the backlash of corporate failure.
Despite the attention attracted by the well-known cases of corporate
failure, many of the banks' bad debt problems have been caused by small
firms. Nearly half National Westminster's bad debt provisions of Pounds
1.3bn in branch banking last year were on loans of less than Pounds 50,000 -
both corporate and personal.
Banks have drawn three lessons from these problems. The first is that they
have assessed the level of risk wrongly. The second is that much of what
they took to be retrievable loan capital was in effect equity. The third is
that they did not have enough data to understand their debtors.
The problem with the re-assessment of risk is that small business lending
risk is closely allied to the severity of economic cycles. This means that
much of the calculation of future risk depends on which view the bank takes
of Britain achieving more stability.
Assuming greater stability in future, banks would be wrong to price loans to
compensate for a similar wave of corporate failure. Such pricing would raise
margins drastically, and would risk them losing market share to others, or
to other forms of financing such as leasing and factoring.
The second lesson is illustrated by the fact that NatWest estimates that 25
per cent of the 1m small companies who deal with the bank are continuously
overdrawn. They are thus clearly not using the whole of their overdraft
facilities purely as an occasional source of working capital.
The problem is what action banks need to take. The British preference for
shorter-term sources of financing - notably the overdraft which is not
available in many other countries - is not something banks can correct
alone, although most are putting more effort into extolling fixed rate
loans.
One answer would be to try to provide more equity capital to small companies
on the model of Germany. However, few UK commercial banks have the expertise
at branch level to feel confident in taking equity stakes. Moves towards
developing venture capital expertise have so far been limited.
Nonetheless, UK bankers are getting increasingly worried about the
traditional structure of lending. Mr Brian Pearse, chief executive of HSBC's
UK subsidiary Midland Bank, has called for banks to find ways of encouraging
equity stakes, including the offer of equity options to small firms.
The third lesson is that banks have discovered little they know about many
of the 3.3m small firms with which they have relationships. Partly this is
because some relaxed diligence of new propositions in the late 1980s as
asset price rises seemed to make them needless.
Banks tend to argue that this is partly because companies do not know enough
about their own businesses. Barclays Bank recently published survey figures
showing that 54 per cent of British small businesses do not have a financial
plan that includes budgets, and analysis of cash flow.
Nonetheless, banks are actively thinking of ways in which to encourage the
businesses with which they deal to collect and forward more thorough
information. Some banks are also trying to monitor account movements to
identify earlier those companies which are heading into financial problems.
These developments pose two questions for small business financing. The
first is whether particular banks are likely to build a greater market share
by moving aggressively into the market while others hold back. The other is
whether forms of non-bank finance will achieve more prominence.
As far as individual banks are concerned, the one most likely to build
market share appears to be Midland. It has gained both greater capital
strength, and treasury and trade finance resources from the HSBC acquisition
last year. The bank has been emphasising this in marketing efforts.
As far as wider competition is concerned, leasing and factoring companies
and bank subsidiaries are emphasising the benefits of alternative forms of
finance. However, the overall structure of small corporate finance appears
to depend above all on bank strategies.
For the moment, relatively weak loan demand means that banks and their
customers are not faced by hard choices. But the hardest question for both
sides is whether they will force the changes about which they are talking
when the recovery picks up, and real choices have to be made.

FT  19 JUL 93 / Survey of Corporate Finance (6): Rise of a new, bolder breed
/ A look at the expanding role of accountancy firms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GERRY ACHER and Stephen Barrett seem to have little in common as they sit
next to each other on the far side of a desk in an office at KPMG Peat
Marwick.
Mr Acher is quietly-spoken, soberly dressed with a plain shirt and a
conservative tie. Mr Barrett has a mellifluous voice and youthful looks to
match his wide, pin-striped suit, loud, green braces and pink shirt.
Yet both men work in the same firm - the former a lifetime accountant with
what he calls 'The House of Peat' and now one of its senior partners and
head of KPMG Corporate Finance; the latter a newly-recruited partner into
the division from Lloyds Merchant Bank.
They epitomise the increasingly blurred description of what constitutes an
accountancy firm. They serve particularly to illustrate the new, aggressive
breed in the larger firms encroaching into the terrain of the banks in both
strategy and culture.
Take, for corroboration's sake, Howard Hyman and Anthony Browne, sitting in
an office less than a mile downstream at Price Waterhouse. Both trained as
auditors, but the former in particular has taken on much of the charismatic
manner more usually associated with bankers than accountants.
Mr Hyman, head of corporate finance for Europe for the firm, is keen to show
off his trophies. As he talks, he bounces up from his chair and reaches for
an armful of paperweight 'tombstones' encased in acrylic plastic, mini
reproductions of the documents on deals in which Price Waterhouse has been
involved.
It is an appropriate gesture in a market dominated by show and aggressive
marketing. Warming to his theme, Mr Hyman finishes filling the table in
front of him with the tombstones and reaches for a trade magazine survey
showing PW top among accountants for cross-border mergers and acquisition
work in Europe.
'We are genuinely a four-business firm,' says Mr Hyman, arguing that
corporate finance - including insolvency - is a strong contributor alongside
the traditional areas of accounting and audit, tax and consulting. He says
that in the year to June, his division contributed one quarter of the UK's
profits, and more than 15 per cent of those across Europe.
KPMG, needless to say, points to a different set of statistics than PW's,
which shows to the contrary that it has dominance of the key elements in the
corporate finance sector. Of course, the same trick reverberates around the
other Big Six firms - and many of their smaller counterparts.
Each highlights its pre-eminence by some measure, while the partners
concerned hint darkly and discreetly about the viability of their
competitors. Is a pan-European structure a needless additional cost? Does
investigations work logically sit within corporate finance?
Mr Hyman goes so far as to say that he does not want to reveal too much
about his own strategy, since he is sure that - as so often in the past - it
will quickly be taken up by his rivals.
There is no doubt that accountants have made significant inroads into
corporate finance in the past few years. They have gone well beyond the
traditional role of due diligence work or accounting investigation, into the
realms of brokering marriages between companies and finding financial
support.
That is a trend which has not been altogether favourably received by the
merchant banks. They may have been nonchalant during the late 1980s, when
there was enough business for everyone; but in the recession of the early
1990s, at a time of far more talk than action, they are becoming more
resentful.
But the accountants believe there is room for both sectors. Mr Acher says
his target markets are privatisations, deals worth below Pounds 20m, and the
documentary aspects of larger takeovers. 'I'm pretty relaxed about it and
the merchant banks are pretty relaxed about it,' he says. 'We are not a
threat to them.'
Mr Hyman adds that accountants have proved their worth to banks, especially
when it comes to providing large numbers of staff who can work on a single
deal - quantities which could not be easily provided by a bank.
New Stock Exchange regulations allow the accountants to act as sponsors on
new issues for the first time this year - although Mr Acher believes this is
probably a less profitable and enticing area for KPMG.
In more indirect ways, the merchant banks have struck back. Not all those
who have left to join accountancy firms have stayed. Mr Barrett believes he
will, because he has entered at the right level - a junior partner, young
enough to adapt to the partnership culture.
But there is also an element of concern in the expanding accountants' role
within the profession. Mr Andy Pollock of Rees Pollock, a London firm
created by former Ernst &amp; Young people, says: 'Accountants should be
accountants. They should keep to investigations work and leave much of the
other work to the merchant banks and corporate finance boutiques.'
He argues there is a fundamental conflict of interest - which is
particularly strong in the Big Six firms - acting for both or, in the
extreme, several different sides in corporate finance work; an auditor
finding a financier, advising management, and conducting due diligence for
both sides - and partly paid through success fees.
'You have to ask why so many deals have fallen through so quickly,' he says.
'Nobody is taking a good, independent look at the figures.' He cites a
recent case in which a bank has commissioned his firm, which found problems
overlooked by the auditor. The problems hardly something that auditor would
have been happy mentioning to the bank if it had been commissioned to do the
work instead.
But this argument leaves Mr Acher unmoved. 'Very often there is a degree of
comfort in using the same firm,' he says. 'But if any party believes there
is a conflict, I would be happy to drop away. Goodwill is so important and
we are of such a size that it doesn't cause us a conflict to do so.'

FT  19 JUL 93 / Survey of Corporate Finance (3): Confidence begins to return
 -United Kingdom
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
AFTER the exciting years of the late 1980s, the UK mergers and acquisitions
market went into hibernation in the early 1990s. Last year it barely stirred
in its deep sleep. But now there are signs that the market is waking up.
This is not to say that a return to the action of the last decade is
expected, in the short or even long term. It is agreed that the frenetic
activity seen then is unlikely to be repeated.
But one merchant banker reports the first half of 1993 has been as busy as
ever before in his corporate finance department, though much of the work is
new issues and privatisations as well as bids and deals activity.
Another says: 'Confidence is beginning to come back, but slowly. In 1992,
companies were keeping their heads down, containing costs and no-one wanted
to know about making bids. Now they are beginning to look at expanding by
acquisition again.'
However, many consider there are few 'cheap' companies available to a
bidder. The high level of the stock market relative to companies' earnings
means businesses are expensive to buy. Furthermore, the increasing amount of
research done on companies means there are fewer undervalued stocks around.
Certainly the trend of hostile, break-up bids seems over. Hanson's Pounds
780m hostile bid for Ranks Hovis McDougall last November was topped by a
recommended Pounds 935m offer from rival Tomkins in December. Even the
Tomkins bid might have appeared an old-style unbundling attempt but seven
months on Tomkins had not made a single significant disposal of RHM assets.
Other hostile bids have failed - such as T. Cowie's offer for Henlys Group
last summer, and Airtours offer for Owners Abroad this year - as investors
have given the target company's management a chance to prove themselves.
Gone too appears to be the simplistic attitude that a company on a p/e of 20
can pay 15 times earnings for another, and make money on the deal.
One merchant banker says that hostile bids and financially driven bids are
'extremely difficult to win. Investors want a cash alternative and these are
difficult to provide'.
Traditionally, companies making share bids have offered a cash alternative
through the underwriting system. However, such cash underpinnings are
expensive in commissions.
The takeover timetable in the UK takes up to 60 days from the issue of the
first offer document, and longer if a competing bid appears. Underwriters
demand higher commissions for longer risk periods, especially in bids where
if the stock market falls during the offer period, shareholders in the
target company are more likely to opt for the cash alternative leaving more
stock with the underwriters.
Airtours, for instance, said its failed bid for Owners Abroad cost Pounds
9m, of which Pounds 5m covered underwriting commissions and advisers' fees.
Agreed deals can be easier to finance, for example using vendor placings
which can be arranged to coincide with the announcement of the bid, or
issuing convertible Eurobonds.
Pilkington's Pounds 95m purchase of Heywood Williams glass distribution arm,
for instance, was financed by the issue of a sterling 5-year bond with
equity warrants. Sedgwick, the insurance broker, financed its acquisition of
Medisure, a private health insurer, by a share placing and later issued a
convertible bond. T &amp; N, the motor component maker, financed its purchase of
Goetze, a German piston ring manufacturer, with a share placing.
If hostile bids are out of fashion, agreed or friendly deals are the vogue.
And while conglomeration - buying an extra leg - is also demode, industry
restructuring through friendly deals is in.
Says one corporate financier: 'There is a trend for less financially-driven
activity and more industrially-driven activity.' Such deals are more likely
to be friendly, since, he argues, if there is a strong commercial logic then
both sides will recognise it.
Take for instance the recent agreed deal between Greenalls and Devenish. The
combination of the two pub operators will produce one of the biggest chains
in the UK, with more than 2,000 pubs. Only two years ago Devenish
successfully fought off a hostile bid from Boddington.
Other instances of commercially driven deals are BT's recently announced
alliance with MCI of the US, which involves a joint venture between the two
and BT taking a 20 per cent stake in MCI; and Richemont's decision to
rearrange its luxury goods and tobacco brands into separate companies.
Another trend is towards cross-border deals. Many companies now feel
constrained by their domestic markets and want to expand internationally.
The agreed bid by Kingfisher, the retail group, for Darty, the French
electrical chain, was Kingfisher's first significant move outside the UK.
One expert says that in the past five years, more than 60 per cent of merger
and acquisition activity by UK companies has involved buying or selling a
non-UK asset. To meet these needs many banks are now stressing their global
strengths, and ability to advise clients on doing deals in different
continents.
Many UK merchant banks have wide networks covering Europe, America and the
Far East. Also, those US banks which have succeeded in the UK market have
done so by stressing their international expertise. Goldman Sachs, for
instance, developed its UK business initially in the early 1980s by advising
UK companies on buying businesses in the US.
Within merchant banks one trend has been to develop expertise in particular
industry sectors. If a corporate financier knows an industry intimately he
can suggest deals to companies, or think laterally around a client's
problem.
Fees for corporate finance work do not seem to have fallen much, in spite of
competition for work. One merchant banker says: 'There has been some
evidence of fee cutting. If clients are in recession we must be as
reasonable as we can be on fees. But no one is gaining market share on that
basis.' Many say that fees are heavily success-related, with fee structures
designed only to cover costs if a transaction does not go ahead.

FT  19 JUL 93 / Survey of Corporate Finance (2): Bottom-fishing for bargains
 -Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THE market for merger and acquisitions may be quiet in London, but according
to some of the biggest corporate finance houses in the UK, European
cross-border activity has been picking up over the past six months.
Mr Steve Mullins, managing editor of Mergers &amp; Acquisitions International,
believes the past six months have confirmed a trend of the past year: 'The
days of big takeover deals are now over. And it is questionable whether they
will return. But cross-border joint ventures, alliances and mergers are
back.'
The spotlight over the past few years has shifted to the Continent. Goldman
Sachs, which cornered the market in defending targeted companies, says that
in 1992 around two-thirds of the European bids were based on the Continent,
with a third in the UK. In 1987, the reverse was true. Some of the biggest
banks based in London, such as J Henry Schroder Wagg and Morgan Grenfell,
now devote a far bigger share of their resources and staff to work on
Continental deals.
Lazard Houses, involved in the merger between Kingfisher in the UK and Darty
of France earlier in the year, attributes the growth in cross-border
activity to the fact that European companies are too small to consolidate in
their own country.
Mr Ali Wambold, head of Lazard Brothers international work and a partner of
Lazard Freres in New York, says: 'Most European companies are now too small
for much consolidation within their own backyard. They can either grow
through organic growth or through diversification. Since the latter is out
of fashion more companies are seeking to expand through cross-border merger
or acquisitions.'
Mr David Challen, head of corporate finance at Schroders, says European
cross-border mergers and acquisitions account for half of all of the
investment banks' public activities - a very different picture from five
years ago.
'We decided to develop a serious capability in Europe which has coincided
with far more of this activity. US businesses also increasingly believe that
they need to be established within this growing market.'
Mr Derek Higgs, managing director of SG Warburg, expects a continuing amount
of special cross-border activity. 'Most of the business will be sorting out
things that need sorting.'
A typical example is the decision of the South African Rupert family,
through their Zurich-based vehicle Richemont, to reshuffle their assets into
two defined vehicles. A new company, Vendome, was established to take care
of the Carter and Dunhill operations while the tobacco interests of Alfred
Dunhill were brought under the roof of a smaller Rothmans International.
Mr Guy Dawson, head of corporate finance at Morgan Grenfell, is confident
that the rise of cross-border business should pick up as the year goes on.
'As the recession really bites, businesses are going to have to come to
terms with the fact that they must rationalise. The conditions of activity
are there even if they are not always being turned into transactions.'
Mr David Jarvis, co-head of European Investment banking at Salomon Brothers,
is encouraged by the increase in cross-border mergers and acquisitions.
Yet the pick-up in activity appears to be at odds with what is happening on
the Continent, with many countries going deeper into recession.
However, some advisers believe the recession on the Continent offers
opportunities as well as problems.
Mr Wambold says that two years ago most German companies were not for sale
and even those that were, were 'scooped out under our nose' by another
German company. The recession, in Germany's case the first since the second
world war, has driven companies in need of capital to contemplate mergers or
acquisitions for the first time.
Those sentiments are echoed by Mr Challen. 'Recession in continental Europe
creates opportunities. Some companies may find there is no option but to do
something.'
He has not yet experienced a significant increase in activity from
privately-owned German companies, but believes the recession might be the
factor that forces some of them into contemplating the sale of their
business.
However, as yet they are not showing any signs of going on a purchasing
spree. Mr Wambold still sees the US as the best bet for such activity. 'Many
companies having beaten back the alligators over the past three years and
are now looking to expand themselves.'
While much of that expansion is still happening in the US, which is big
enough to accommodate much of the consolidation that many European companies
cannot complete in their own country, Mr Wambold believes US companies will
increasingly see the opportunities that exist in Europe.
Nonetheless, a problem that still exists for prospective buyers is the
expense of the possible targets. The stock markets and multiples remain
high.
Mainly for this reason Mr Erik Linnes, director at Kleinwort Benson, warns
against over-optimism in the cross-border market. While the Continent is in
recession many buyers are going to sit on their feet. 'It's still a brave
time for any public company to put its head above the parapet and make an
acquisition.'
However, Mr Linnes says some buyers are 'bottom fishing for bargains'. He
attributes the busier cross-border activity to the fact that a number of
companies have decided to 'swim against the tide'. Those companies which are
sellers also know that it is not the best time to dispose of their business
and will be waiting for signs of an upturn in the economy.

FT  19 JUL 93 / Survey of Corporate Finance (5): Exotic options fit the bill
/ A look at new instruments available to corporate treasurers
</HEADLINE>

THE UPHEAVAL in Europe's foreign exchange market last autumn has had a
number of side effects, not least of which has been a reappraisal of
currency risk management by many companies.
Currency risk management is no longer relevant only to exporters and
importers, because many companies now have overseas operations.
However, volatility has also had the effect of raising the cost of
instruments, such as currency options, used to hedge exposure to the foreign
exchange markets.
To win the hearts and minds of corporate treasurers, who tend to baulk at
what they see as overpriced insurance policies, investment banks have become
more adept at structuring more complex options - known as exotic options -
which meet the primary aims of companies at a lower cost. 'The second
generation is important,' said Mr Albert Maasland, manager of foreign
exchange derivatives marketing at Chase Manhattan Bank in London.
'Derivatives on derivatives tend to reduce cost, and if you understand a
client's risk profile, you can structure products to suit their needs.'
But companies are also aware of the risks inherent in the use of these
complex financial instruments.
The loss of Pounds 150m in foreign exchange dealings two years ago by the
treasury department of Allied-Lyons, the UK food and drinks group,
illustrated the potential dangers, if corporate treasury operations are not
carefully controlled. The problem stemmed from the practice of writing
currency options, which can lead to unlimited losses.
There are two types of exposure which companies may try to hedge,
transaction exposure and translation exposure. In the last year, companies
have become more active in hedging transaction exposure - the currency
exposure stemming from a particular sale or purchase of goods of services.
While in the past the tendency has been to hedge next year's budget, or to
hedge known sales or purchases a year ahead, corporate treasurers are now
tending to look a year or two further ahead. 'More companies are saying to
themselves that if they have a currency position which is strategic, they
should start to take the volatility out of that risk,' said Mr Paul Ward, a
director of Salomon Brothers in London.
For UK companies which are effectively long dollars, it may seem attractive
to lock in an exchange rate of Dollars 1.50 to the pound over several years,
for example.
One potential problem with hedging transaction exposure is that there is
some concern that the tax situation may become less favourable in the UK,
and the ability to net positions between different parts of the company may
be reduced in the next Budget.
Attitudes to translation exposure are more mixed. Translation exposure
arises in companies' balance sheets when, for example, a UK-based company is
operating in the US.
If it has no debt and is financed by sterling equity, the value of its
assets against its liabilities will fluctuate. Some companies effectively
hedge against such exposure by borrowing in the relevant foreign currency to
match their assets.
Others take the view that since such exposure is only in the balance sheet,
it is not worth worrying about mere accounting numbers. However, in a highly
geared company, such volatility may affect gearing and have an impact on
banking covenants.
There is widespread agreement among investment bankers that UK companies lag
their European counterparts in their use of derivatives, particularly in the
recent vogue for exotic options.
French companies in particular are known for being highly sophisticated in
their use of options - and also have more autonomous treasury departments.
Among recent popular products which can help reduce costs are basket
options, which allow a company to hedge exposure to a range of currencies,
and average rate options, which allow companies to have a smooth rate
throughout the year. Average rate options are 'a great product for companies
with a regular cash flow, because they are quite simple to explain and
simple to use for (hedging) transaction exposure,' said Ms Sara Sullivan at
Chase Manhattan.
Knock-out options are cheaper because if the underlying spot rate trades
above or below a certain level, the option expires. They are generally about
35 per cent cheaper than other options.
Meanwhile, some companies are eschewing options in favour of dynamic
hedging. In dynamic hedging, instead of buying options, exposure is hedged
by buying and selling forward contracts in the market to replicate options.
This method creates substantial savings for companies, according to Mike
Shilling, assistant director at Record Treasury Management.
Meanwhile, some banks have also been touting Safes - synthetic agreements
for forward foreign exchange - which are essentially forward contracts that
do not require an exchange of principal.
As a result, banks need to devote less capital and are less exposed to the
risk that their counterparty will default. There are two types of Safe: the
exchange rate agreement, or ERA, which protects the purchaser against a
change in the forward foreign exchange spread and the forward exchange
agreement (FXA), which gives protection against a change in the spot rate as
well as the forward spread.

FT  19 JUL 93 / Survey of Corporate Finance (4): Some signs of improvement -
United States
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A HEADY stock market and a heap of economic uncertainties have kept the lid
on merger and acquisition activity in the US. There are some signs that
business is stirring, but it is a patchy trend, made up of
industrially-driven deals and much reshuffling of corporate assets.
The overall figures tell part of the story. According to Merril Lynch
Business Brokerage and Valuation (figures are calculated on a more limited
basis than the accompanying table by Securities Data), 2,578 M &amp; A
transactions were announced in 1992 and the total value of these proposed
deals reached Dollars 97.1bn. That was a significant improvement on the 1991
tally: the number of deals was up by 39 per cent, while the aggregate value
of the transactions increased by 35 per cent.
But, while the deal volume figure hit its highest level for six years, the
value of the proposed transactions was also the second lowest in nine years.
This can be explained very simply. Last year saw an appreciable rise in
smaller deals, but very little evidence that either the blockbuster mega-bid
or the hostile takeover - the combination which provided such rich fees for
investment banks in the 1980s - is returning. There were just 18 deals worth
Dollars 1bn or more announced last year.
Since the start of 1993, the trend has been more ambiguous. For fee-hungry
bankers, the year did not start well. Again on Merrill Lynch's data, the
total value of proposed mergers and acquisitions in the first three months
fell by more than one-fifth from the equivalent 1992 figure, to Dollars
18.1bn. The volume of transactions, however, was down by a less painful 2
per cent at 569.
But this pattern changed significantly in the second quarter, when a handful
of mega deals - worth Dollars 1bn or more - were unleashed. As a result,
Securities Data, the New Jersey-based financial information group, estimates
that the value of domestic mergers showed a 25.6 per cent increase between
the first halves of 1992 and 1993. The number and value of deals announced
in May 'were the highest for a single month since July 1990', it reports.
Included in this wave of transactions was a Dollars 4.3bn tie-up between
British Telecom and MCI; a Dollars 3bn-plus merger of Galen Health Care and
Columbia Hospital Corporation; the Dollars 2.5bn joint venture arrangement
between Time Warner and US West; the Dollars 2.4bn merger of AMAX with
Cypress Minerals; and a Dollars 2bn merger between Price Company and Costco,
two warehouse club retailers.
Is this surge in 'big deals' a flash in the pan? Bankers, who have every
reason to talk their book, say no. They point to a handful of broad economic
trends, plus a number of specific sectoral developments which - by their
reckoning - should ensure that the transactions continue to flow.
The first is the impact of very low inflation - or even falling prices  - in
many industries, and stagnant demand. This has forced companies to focus on
cost-cutting and streamlining their operations.
So a spate of divestments has been triggered. Moreover, because of the heady
stock market levels, 'demergers' or public offerings have become an
increasing popular option, rather than more conventional trade sales.
According to Securities Data, almost 30 spin-offs - either in the form of a
distribution of stock to existing shareholders in the parent company or via
a flotation of shares in the subsidiary - were announced in the first 24
weeks of the year.
The 'demerger' movement has had the odd setback, however. A plan by Marriott
Corporation, to spin off its hotel management business, leaving the ongoing
company to hold the property assets and the bulk of the group's debts,
created a storm of protest among bondholders. The proposal was fine-tuned
and some peace bought, although litigation continues.
But, even if the proposal is eventually implemented, some advisers suggest
that the Marriott fiasco may act as a warning to other companies. 'I think
everyone will now consider the demerger option very carefully,' says one
banker. Meanwhile, a 'targeted stock' scheme proposed by RJR Nabisco - which
would have involved listing shares pegged to the food division, but creating
no legal separation from the group's tobacco interests - was finally
aborted, amid criticism that the plan was too clever by half. Financial
engineering, it seems, is still firmly out of fashion.
It is also no coincidence that the sectors where M &amp; A activity has been
most pronounced are those where technological, political or regulatory
changes are under way. Perhaps the best example is in the communications
field, where what was once a battleground between cable and telephone
companies is evolving into a more complex network of joint ventures and
alliances. Medical services are another area where the deal flow is expected
to continue, if not increase. 'Whatever comes out of the Clinton healthcare
reform package, you're going to see activity in the hospitals and clinical
services,' says Ali Wambold, a general partner of Lazard Freres in New York.
Meanwhile, the cross-border deal flows are spasmodic. With recession hitting
Europe somewhat later than the US, there has been a marked lack of interest
on the part of Continental European acquirers. Stock market levels in the US
are also at historically high levels, and thus a deterrent to buyers. That
said, the recent emphasis on cost-cutting and efficiency in the US, plus the
nation's improving economic prospects, have made the US corporate sector
inherently more attractive. There has been interest from UK purchasers, for
example, with the likes of RTZ, Hanson, Bowater and British Telecom all
tying up deals in recent months.
Meanwhile, many US companies find themselves confronting a fairly mature
domestic market and some burgeoning opportunities overseas. This has
encouraged an increasing 'internationalism' but the sums involved in the
melange of joint ventures, co-operative deals and outright acquisitions are
often modest.

FT  19 JUL 93 / Survey of Corporate Finance (1): Small deals, fewer risks -
Takeover activity is well below that in the late 1980s. Parts of the
corporate finance market, such as advice on privatisations and cross-border
deals, are buoyant, but small businesses are finding loans harder to get
from risk- averse banks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE CORPORATE finance business has gone back to basics. The days of hostile
mega-takeover bids or of radical innovations in financing techniques seem
long past.
Today's mergers tend to be motivated by industrial logic rather than driven
by pure financial goals. Companies have become more conservative in a second
sense - they take greater care to understand the risks associated with
selling a complex financial instrument.
Nonetheless, the volume of debt and equity issues by public companies has
reached record levels in the UK and US over the past few months.
These trends are a response to several factors:
Worldwide recession, which has reduced companies' appetite for expansion and
thus for big takeover bids;
The huge level of indebtedness taken on by companies in the boom years of
the 1980s, which now needs refinancing;
Accounting changes, which have reduced the scope for the sort of financial
engineering which encouraged big takeovers and also the issue of complex
securities;
The financial difficulties of companies which issued hybrid securities or
dabbled in derivative markets without properly understanding the risks or
the true costs.
Published statistics show a stark picture of low takeover activity. In the
UK, for example, Schroders came top of Acquisition Monthly's league table of
financial advisers in the first six months of this year, having given advice
on seven takeovers with an aggregate value of Pounds 491m.
In the late 1980s, when individual bids were worth billions, a merchant bank
would have just scraped into the top ten with that figure.
There was an almost equally flat performance in 1992, when there were only
two takeovers or mergers valued at over Pounds 1bn: HSBC Holdings' takeover
of Midland Bank and Reed International's merger with Elsevier of the
Netherlands. SG Warburg topped the 1992 takeover league table, having acted
in just six deals.
The pattern in the US is similar. The value of takeover deals in 1992 was
Dollars 97.1bn, according to Merrill Lynch Business Brokerage and Valuation.
This was the second lowest figure in nine years - though a third higher than
in the previous year. However, the volume of deals in the US is picking up,
even if the value of the individual deals is small.
There are also some signs that those merchant banks and securities firms
which have invested most heavily in building up international networks of
offices are belatedly deriving a competitive advantage. According to
Securities Data, the top three advisers on majority acquisitions of
companies anywhere in the world in 1992 have all made huge efforts to
establish operations across the globe: the US house, Goldman Sachs, in the
leading position having advised on deals worth Dollars 54bn, the First
Boston/Credit Suisse network as number two with a tally of Dollars 33.6bn,
and SG Warburg of the UK as number three, with deals worth Dollars 33.1bn.
However, one part of the corporate finance market which is booming is the
giving of advice on privatisations. The new French government recently
announced an extremely ambitious privatisation programme. The Italian
government, in spite of the country's economic difficulties, is pressing
ahead with the sale of state assets.
The UK government is continuing to realise public assets - the sale of the
third tranche of British Telecommunications shares being the biggest such
transaction this year.
Finally, there are substantial sales of state assets throughout eastern
Europe and south America - while in China there are opportunities for joint
ventures and licensing agreements.
Another relatively buoyant part of the corporate finance market is
cross-border deals. In the past 18 months, highlights have included the
Reed-Elsevier merger, British Telecommunications' tie-up with MCI in the US,
and Hanson's acquisition of US-based Quantum.
Meanwhile, in the UK there has been a surge of equity issues, as public
companies take advantage of buoyant stock market conditions to rebuild their
balance sheets.
According to a survey by IFR Securities Data, the amount of new equity
capital raised in the first half of this year was 6.6 per cent more than
that raised in the whole of last year.
A total of Pounds 11.8bn has so far been raised this year, compared with
Pounds 11bn in 1992. This year's first half total of 294 new issues is 72
per cent ahead of the figure at the same stage last year.
The preferred method of money raising continues to be the traditional rights
issue of shares to existing shareholders, with Pounds 7.48bn having been
raised in this way.
SG Warburg topped the league table of merchant bankers handling the new
equity issues and Cazenove was the leading broker.
In the US, new stocks and bonds worth Dollars 530bn were sold in the first
six months of 1993, well above the previous record of Dollars 445bn set in
the first half of 1992.
The growth of debt offerings was caused in part by the lowest interest rates
in three decades. These encouraged many companies to pay off expensive
existing debt with new, cheaper debt.
There was also strong demand for equity from companies. A record Dollars
47bn in new shares was sold between January and the end of June. However,
more than half of this was in the form of initial public offerings or
company flotations.
The number of big companies careering towards bankruptcy has fallen, but
this is not undiluted good news for corporate finance departments. It has
led to a reduction in fee-earning opportunities from advising on financial
reconstructions. Nonetheless, the negotiations on restructuring the debt of
GPA, the world's biggest aircraft leasing company, have provided rich
pickings for a pack of financial, legal and accounting advisers.
But one type of company in several countries - notably the US and the UK -
has become concerned that traditional sources of finance have become more
difficult to tap. Small and medium-size companies complain that banks are
increasingly reluctant to lend to them or only to make loans at penal rates
of interest.
Banks quibble with these complaints. They say that the recession has led to
a shortage of demand for funds from 'bankable' companies. If the demand for
loans was there, the banks say, they would provide them.
What has happened is that banks have become more risk-averse in the past
couple of years. Their biggest loan losses in recent years have come from
lending to small companies, so they have become far more careful in
analysing the quality of the potential borrower before making a commitment
to lend.
A second factor is reducing the supply of new loans to this sector.
Regulators are forcing banks to adhere to tougher standards of capital
adequacy - rules governing the amount of capital a bank must have in
proportion to the loans it makes - than a few years ago. The less that a
bank lends, relative to a given stock of capital, the better its capital
ratio.
So today when capital is in short supply, banks are lending at a slower rate
than in the 1980s. However, small companies are particularly vulnerable to
this slowdown in bank lending, because even bank regulators perceive them to
be particularly risky customers.
When calculating the risk asset ratio, the commonly agreed international
standard of capital adequacy, a home loan or purchase of government bonds
carries a lower risk weighting than a corporate loan. That means if a bank
makes a loan to a small company of a given size, its capital ratio is
reduced by a greater amount than if it makes a home loan of equivalent size
 -so it will only make that corporate loan if it believes the profitability
of doing so is greater than in making a home loan.
In other areas of corporate finance, leading investment banks say their
pipeline of potential mergers and acquisitions deals is far greater than a
year ago. What no one is predicting is a return to the corporate finance
boom conditions of the 1980s.

FT  19 JUL 93 / Universities seek new funding sources
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNIVERSITY PRINCIPALS have commissioned London Economics, an economic
consultancy, to examine alternative ways of raising additional funds.
The move follows cuts earlier this year in the tuition fees paid by the
government to universities. These have led several universities to predict
reductions in courses, including those for teacher training. They say some
additional source of funds is necessary if a decline in standards is to be
avoided.
A final report will be published in the second week of August, as
18-year-olds receive their A-level results, and will then be presented to
the Department for Education.
The Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals says three alternatives are
being considered:
A graduate tax, whereby all graduates who had reached a certain level of
income would pay an extra level of tax, which would be dedicated to higher
education.
Repayable loans along the lines of those in Australia, whereby students
would repay a fixed tuition fee over a period of time determined by their
level of earnings.
Top-up fees, whereby universities would charge students whatever extra fees
they felt necessary above a fixed fee paid by the government.
London Economics is evaluating the proposals to see how effectively funds
could be collected in each case. Principals will make a definite
recommendation in favour of one of the options once the report is completed.
Tuition fees paid by the government were cut from Pounds 1,850 per student
to Pounds 1,300 for classroom-based courses. Fees for scientific and medical
courses are higher and remained unchanged.
Mr Tim Boswell, higher education minister, has stated that the government
will not stop individual universities from charging extra for tuition.
A graduate tax has growing support, and has been endorsed by Manchester
University's students' union as a way of avoiding cuts.
The Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals reported particular concern
about education courses. It said: 'Several universities are looking at
whether or not it's worth their while to be in the market for teacher
training at all, particularly given the government's latest proposals for
shifting initial teacher training towards schools.'
The Department for Education said it would look carefully at any proposals
from universities. It recognised that graduates would be less likely to
choose teaching once the economy recovered, and this explained the move to
introduce reforms of teacher training announced last month. These included
allowing non-graduates to teach in primary schools.
The interest rate on student loans is to fall to 1.2 per cent in the
academic year starting September 1, it was announced yesterday.
The government-owned Student Loans Company, which runs the scheme, said it
was a 'significant fall' from the previous rate of 3.9 per cent for the
1992-93 academic year, and 5.8 per cent the year before. In the academic
year 1991-92 student loans totalled Pounds 128m.

FT  19 JUL 93 / Group 4 hunts big share of penal market: The company's
growing ambitions to 'release the police from time-consuming duties'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GROUP 4, the private security company, although defeated last week in the
competition to run Manchester's Strangeways prison, is still enthusiastic to
expand in the criminal justice market.
The fact that there is such a thing as an embryonic market for criminal
justice services owes a good deal to Group 4. Last year it became the first
private company to manage a prison - Wolds on Humberside - and in April took
on the first private contract to escort prisoners to court.
Yet the company has paid a price for being the first in a sensitive area
where, penal reformers and opposition politicians believe, there are moral
objections to private-sector involvement. The escape of prisoners in the
early days of the escort contract made the company the subject of both
criticism and jokes. Fresh attention will be focused on Wolds when the
report on the prison's first official inspection is published soon.
But Mr Jim Harrower, UK chief executive of Group 4, is convinced that public
spending pressures and the trend for governments to contract out delivery of
services will lead to further private-sector involvement in criminal justice
activities, both in Britain and elsewhere.
Group 4, which has its headquarters in the Netherlands, operates in more
than 30 countries worldwide. It has recently started to expand in Australia,
Canada and New Zealand - partly because of market opportunities that match
its core security activities, but also because Group 4 sees these countries
as likely to follow the UK example of contracting out criminal justice work
to the private sector.
'I envisage the private sector eventually financing, designing, building and
operating prisons,' said Mr Harrower. 'But if this is to happen, the sector
must take a serious and responsible view of prison management.
'Running a successful prison means establishing effective education
programmes, drug and alcohol programmes, training programmes and industrial
activities. I want to see Group 4 making a real contribution to addressing
the problems of offending behaviour and trying to get reoffending levels
down,' he added.
He recognises that the private security industry does not always enjoy the
high public reputation to match such high-sounding ideals.
Mr Harrower has, as chairman of the British Security Industry Association,
urged the government to legislate for statutory regulation of standards in
the industry. Ministers have so far advocated self-regulation instead.
'The industry is extending its codes of practice and developing standards to
demonstrate that it can regulate itself,' he said. 'But the problem is that
self-regulation is viewed with suspicion by the public.'
Group 4 got to the shortlist stage in the competition to run Strangeways.
With the contract awarded to the public-sector in-house team, the next big
prize for the private companies is the new prison at Doncaster, South
Yorkshire. Invitations to tender for this contract, worth about Pounds 15m a
year, are likely to go out next month.
Doncaster will definitely go to the private sector - there is no in-house
team there - and Group 4 would particularly like to manage it. The prison is
in the same region as the Wolds and the company's prison escort contract,
and would open up the prospect of Group 4 providing an integrated range of
criminal justice services throughout the area.
Mr Harrower, as well as bidding for the contract to provide escort services
in London when they go to private management next year, sees further scope
for the security industry in the government's drive to increase police
efficiency. This could lead to activities as varied as shopping centre
patrols, criminal records, escorting wide loads on the roads and operating
motorway speed cameras being considered for contracting out.
Such moves would again raise questions about the regulation of standards,
and the relationship between the police and the private security industry.
'There are areas where the industry can release the police from
time-consuming duties,' said Mr Harrower. 'But there must remain a clear
dividing line between security companies and the police. We can gather
evidence of possible offences, but must not get involved in decisions to
prosecute. So it would be legitimate for private companies to gather
information by operating motorway speed cameras, although I would not want
Group 4 doing it - we have our reputation to consider.'
Until the acquisition of Intergarde Monitor Security in Belgium in 1991,
Group 4's UK operation was by far its largest. The UK and Belgium operations
are now of broadly equal size - UK turnover was Pounds 142m last year, up
from Pounds 127m in 1991.
Turnover worldwide was Pounds 414m - an increase of 35 per cent over 1991,
of which 15.4 per cent represented growth in sales turnover. Manned services
such as security guarding are Group 4's main activity - these contributed
Pounds 266m of worldwide turnover.

FT  19 JUL 93 / Doubt raised on Sizewell C timing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NUCLEAR ELECTRIC, the state-owned generating company, has applied to
demolish a dock next to the site of the proposed Sizewell C nuclear power
station in Suffolk, suggesting that an application to build the Pounds 3.5bn
plant is still some way off.
The Pounds 6m dock was built three years ago to handle large loads for the
construction of Sizewell B. Nuclear Electric was hoping to use it when the
proposed twin-reactor Sizewell C plant was built.
In the continuing absence of permission from the Department of Trade and
Industry to submit a planning application for Sizewell C, officials have
bowed to local pressure to demolish the dock, which is causing erosion of
Sizewell beach.
The local authority fears that in the long term the effects could be felt
further along the coast.
Nuclear Electric had hoped to receive permission to submit a planning
application for Sizewell C after the coal review earlier this year.

FT  19 JUL 93 / Comprehensives attacked over GCSE pass rate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'TOO MANY' pupils at comprehensive schools failed to pass any GCSEs last
year, says a report published today by a member of the team reviewing the
national curriculum in England and Wales.
A third of pupils obtained no GCSEs in at least one comprehensive in 20 per
cent of the local education authority areas in the country. A GCSE pass at
the lowest available level (grade G) is equivalent to a CSE grade five.
Dr John Marks, a leading rightwing theorist, used records of last year's
GCSE results as the basis of his study. In a third of local education
authority areas, he says, 10 times as many pupils achieved GCSE grades A to
C - equivalent to old-fashioned O-level passes - at the best school as at
the worst.
The research also suggests that the inspections planned next year by the
Office for Standards in Education, the government's new organisation for
school inspection, will miss most of the under-achieving schools. Of the 289
schools where more than three times the national average fail to pass any
GCSEs, only 30 will be inspected next year. About 6.7 per cent of pupils
failed to pass any GCSEs last year.
Differences between authorities were less marked, and tended to correlate
with levels of poverty. The six authorities where more pupils passed no
GCSEs than those who passed five to at least grade C were all in inner-city
areas.
Mr Doug McAvoy, general secretary of the National Union of Teachers,
suggested that the disparities could be explained by catchment areas.
He said: 'If you look at the size of a local education authority,
communities within it can differ. Communities which speak English as a
second language will tend to send all their children to the same school
within one authority.'

FT  19 JUL 93 / Inquiry into NatWest data urged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR yesterday called for a full public inquiry into National Westminster
Bank's policy of holding information about the political affiliation and
religious beliefs of some of its 6.5m personal customers.
Mr Nigel Griffiths, Labour's consumer spokesman, said that NatWest's actions
were 'a monstrous invasion of people's privacy' and called for legislation
to limit the collection and prevent the sale of sensitive personal data by
banks.
NatWest is believed to be the only one of the four big banks to record this
type of information about its customers.
The bank said yesterday that it did not solicit the information but if it
had data which it judged to be helpful in building up a profile of its
customers, it would record it in order to service them more efficiently.
NatWest added: 'Banks are about building up a relationship with their
customers. You build up the relationship by knowing about them.' It was not
able to give any examples of the circumstances in which information such as
political affiliation, religious beliefs or dietary habits might be used but
denied that it would affect the granting of loans to some customers.
Last week Mr Eric Howe, the data protection registrar, raised concerns about
the confidentiality of bank customers' personal details. He called for new
laws to stamp out the growing black market in confidential personal
information.
The black market has grown because unauthorised individuals have been able
to gain access to personal details by deceiving bank staff into supplying
data or because some staff may be knowingly providing it.
Mr John Lamidey, the assistant data protection registrar, yesterday said
that he was surprised at the type of information recorded by NatWest but
noted that it did not contravene the Data Protection Act. This obliges
organisations storing personal data on computer to register the type of data
recorded.
'Providing the purpose is lawful, the act does not lay down what information
you should hold,' he said.
Lloyds Bank yesterday said that its centralised computer system held
personal details such as religious beliefs only indirectly. For example the
file for a devout Moslem, for whom the taking of interest payments is
prohibited under Sharia law, would not state his religion but would carry
the instruction not to offer the customer details of interest-bearing
accounts.
Midland Bank said it did not store this type of information and found it
strange that NatWest did. Barclays Bank said it did not hold information
about customers' political affiliations.

FT  19 JUL 93 / Deal primes village for a moving experience
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INHABITANTS of Arkwright village in Derbyshire have moved closer to a new
future, with different homes, following the award by British Coal of a
Pounds 60m opencast mining contract.
The corporation plans to use some of the money it will make from the coal,
to be mined at a nearby site under contract by RJB Mining, to relocate the
300 residents to a new village a quarter of a mile from the existing one.
Villagers will exchange their back-to-back houses in the traditional mining
village for new homes with market values of up to Pounds 60,000. British
Coal will also provide community centre facilities.
The rebuilding of Arkwright follows occasional escapes of methane gas from
the nearby disused drift mine. At times residents have been forced to leave
their homes.
RJB Mining expects to recover about 3.5m tonnes of coal from the site near
Staveley.
The contract, the company's tenth for British Coal for an opencast mine,
will run for nine years.
The company said the contract would utilise equipment at present used in a
contract at Tinsley, South Yorkshire. RJB added that when it had finished
the extraction of coal it would restore the land for agricultural use.

FT  19 JUL 93 / Insurers could face Pounds 100m bill
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INSURERS face a potential bill of more than Pounds 100m over the next few
years following a ruling by the House of Lords. This came in a long-running
case stemming from the failure in 1990 of London United Investments, the
insurance and property group.
The case concerned the liability of the Policyholders' Protection Board for
claims from non-resident policyholders. The board meets 90 per cent of all
claims from private policyholders when UK insurers go out of business.
Payments are funded by UK insurers, with the size of levies varying
according to each company's share of the market. The annual amount payable
by companies is limited to a maximum of 1 per cent of premium income.
The Lords ruled that several thousand US policyholders could claim
compensation even though they were not resident in the UK. However, it
reserved judgment as to whether a number of professional partnerships could
be considered as private policyholders.
Those benefiting from the ruling bought insurance from five LUI subsidiaries
 -Kingscoft Insurance, El Paso Insurance, Lime Street Insurance and Mutual
Re, collectively known as the KELM companies - and Walbrook Insurance.
The Lords' decision upheld rulings in the lower court which define a UK
policy as one issued by a UK authorised insurance company operating out of
the UK, irrespective of where the risk covered by the policy is located.
Mr Philip Rocher of Wilde Sapte, the firm of solicitors which represented
policyholders in the case, said: 'This is not a defeat for the UK insurance
industry. It reaffirms the security of their policies.'

FT  19 JUL 93 / Fifth of companies cut union recognition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALMOST one in five companies employing more than 1,000 workers have
withdrawn union recognition partly or completely over the past five years,
research for the Department of Employment shows.
A survey for the employment department by researchers at Warwick, Sheffield
and Oxford universities found that a quarter of those derecognising unions
did so at most or all of their sites.
Falling union membership among the workforce was one of the most common
reasons employers gave for derecognition, the study of 176 UK and
overseas-owned companies says.
The full survey is to be published in September by Warwick University's
industrial relations research unit. The survey's preliminary findings are
reported in this month's issue of Personnel Management Plus, the Institute
of Personnel Management's magazine.
Of those companies opening at least one new site over the past five years,
59 per cent have not recognised unions.
However, of the 82 per cent of companies which reported taking over one or
more operating sites as going concerns, more than 90 per cent had maintained
union recognition.

FT  19 JUL 93 / Monks wants TUC to do less but better: The likely new
general secretary should be able to turn rhetoric into action
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MONKS is due to emerge today as sole candidate for general secretary
of the Trades Union Congress, one of the toughest jobs in the country.
Toughness is something he seems to have in abundance.
Mr Monks, TUC deputy general secretary and a former personnel manager, has
been scarcely visible in the shadow of his boss Mr Norman Willis for the
past nine years. But in that time he has grown in stature as a manager and
acquired a coldly realistic view of the trade union movement's real
influence.
In a confidential document on the future of the TUC presented to the general
council last week he said that the organisation's 'limited effectiveness' in
channelling national worries about pit closures and unemployment 'raises
questions about the need for a reappraisal of the role of the TUC'.
The simple answer is that the TUC should do fewer things more effectively.
But that has been a commonplace of union discussion for years without any
substantial action being taken.
Mr Monks, unlike his predecessor, means business. He is expected to announce
today that the general council has agreed to his proposal for a weekend
summit, possibly at the Cranfield School of Management, to hammer out a
programme of action on focusing the TUC's work.
One insider said: 'For too long the union barons have talked about focusing
the work of the TUC while at the same time complaining that the organisation
is not doing more of everything. John will not let them get away with that.'
Mr Monks is the son of a parks superintendent. He went to school in
Manchester's Moss Side district before gaining a degree in economic history
at Nottingham University.
He worked for two years as a management trainee with manufacturing giant
Plessey in Surrey before joining the TUC in 1969.
The TUC now employs 150 people, after a 20 per cent staffing cut driven
through by Mr Monks last year, and soaks up about Pounds 10m of trade union
funds. In return it provides some services to its affiliated unions,
representing 7.3m workers, and acts as the labour movement's civil service,
running nine committees of the TUC general council and producing documents
on most of the big public policy issues of the day.
Mr Monks and many of his senior colleagues believe it should now concentrate
on a few key areas such as Europe, health and safety, pensions and labour
law. They also want the TUC to become a more politically neutral lobby
organisation, expert in all matters relevant to the workplace. Mr Monks is
particularly interested in human resources management and the rapid changes
in the UK labour market which he believes could be eroding the concept of
the 'steady job'.
In his report he says: 'Significant TUC resources are devoted to sustaining
and servicing structures rather than pursuing clearly defined objectives
that have been agreed at the political level . . . Within committee agendas
not enough progress has been made at focusing on the key priorities. Too
much resource is consumed in preparing for meetings, and not enough on
following through decisions.'
Much the same could be said of most bureaucracies but the TUC has been
suffering a more rapid decline than most. Mr Monks cannot reverse that
decline, which shows no sign of abating in spite of an improved public
standing. Nor can he change government views which range between hostility
and indifference.
But he can ensure that the TUC is more effectively run and can hope to
influence those affiliates most in need of help.
Mr Monks, who was a protege of former TUC leader Len Murray in the 1970s, is
not a man bursting with new ideas and will not be a star performer on TV and
radio. But in the world of the union movement his competence could make a
big difference.

FT  19 JUL 93 / Tendering warning issued
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Tony Baldry, environment minister, issued a warning to local authorities
yesterday over compulsory competitive tendering. He said the government
would not hesitate to use its powers to force councils to re-tender if they
were found to be acting unfairly.
In a speech in Nottingham he said compulsory competitive tendering had
opened up more than Pounds 2.5bn of local services to private-sector
competition, giving local taxpayers and residents lower prices and better
services.
Mr Baldry admitted that the courts' 'wider' interpretation of the Transfer
of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) regulations, which often
guarantee the jobs and pay of the existing workforce when work is contracted
out, were 'a new factor' which private tenderers needed to consider.
But he said this should not be an obstacle. 'A Tupe-based bid will probably
have a higher up-front cost - but it involves no redundancy costs,' he said.
Mr Jack Straw, shadow environment secretary, will today call for a Commons
statement on the government's local government review. The move follows
speculation that ministers may be planning measures that will deny unitary
authority status to a number of big cities and boroughs.

FT  19 JUL 93 / Investment level 'hits recovery'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LOW manufacturing in-vestment in the late 1980s has put the recovery at
risk, an economist warns today.
Mr Ian Shepherdson, of Midland Global Markets, writes in Midland's weekly
circular that too little of the wealth generated during the late 1980s boom
went into building up manufacturing.
The result is that the UK 'still does not have a sufficiently large
manufacturing sector', he adds.
The report underlines concerns in the City that Britain's large deficit on
manufactured goods will increase as the economy expands. This might put a
brake on overall economic growth, possibly because a large deficit could
weaken sterling and so lead to inflationary pressures and higher interest
rates.
In his report Mr Shepherdson says net investment by manufacturing in the
1980s was low even by the standards of the 1970s - generally believed to
have been a dire era for the sector.
Net investment, which accounts for machinery and buildings written off
because of being obsolete or worn out, totalled 3 per cent of manufacturers'
trading profits during the 1980s, compared with 10 per cent in the 1970s.
In 1985 prices, net manufacturing investment during the 1980s totalled
Pounds 6bn, after Pounds 26bn in the 1970s.
Mr Shepherdson says that in other areas - such as in rising output per
employee and attracting overseas investment - UK manufacturing performed
well in the 1980s. However, the promised overall benefits from such trends
'have been slow in appearing'. The report warns: 'Rebuilding the
manufacturing sector could take a decade, or even a generation.'

FT  19 JUL 93 / Heath suggests talks with Sinn Fein
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT should consider holding talks with Sinn Fein, the IRA's
political wing, Sir Edward Heath said yesterday, describing such a step as
'a sensible thing to do' when the time was right.
The former Conservative prime minister told BBC Radio 4: 'When the moment is
right, I have no objection to them telling Sinn Fein exactly what the
government's position is and trying to influence them to have much greater
influence over their military counterpart, the IRA, and get them to pack it
all in.'
He said: 'I do not object to people having talks with other political
people. During my government Lord Whitelaw had direct talks with the IRA.'
Sir Edward also criticised Mr John Major, the prime minister, for attacking
Mrs Mary Robinson, the Irish president, over her recent brief meeting with
Mr Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein.
Sir Edward said he would keep Mr Ian Paisley, the Democrat Unionist leader,
out of any discussions on the province's future.
He urged Mr Major to appoint a senior cabinet member with sole
responsibility for dealing with terrorism.
The timing of his remarks was intriguing because the government may need to
persuade Ulster Unionists to vote with it to win Thursday's crucial
Maastricht vote.
Two weeks ago Mr Major triggered a rare political row on Northern Ireland at
Westminster by angrily denouncing an idea floated by Labour that
responsibility for the province should be shared between London and Dublin.
His comments, which infuriated nationalist MPs, were widely thought to have
set back still further the chances of round-table talks on Ulster resuming
this year.

FT  19 JUL 93 / Financial Law Panel chief named
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR COLIN BAMFORD, head of finance and banking at Richards Butler, the law
firm, is to be the first chief executive of the Bank of England-sponsored
Financial Law Panel.
The panel, chaired by Lord Donaldson, has attracted wide support from some
150 subscribers in all sectors of the financial services industry. It will
address ambiguous legal issues which would otherwise jeopardise London's
standing as an international financial centre.
The panel was set up after a High Court ruling that local authorities do not
have the power to enter into interest-rate swap and currency swap
agreements, a decision which cost banks hundreds of millions of pounds.
Lord Donaldson said the panel, set up in March, has received numerous
requests to examine aspects of City law. 'Some of these were wholly
ambitious, such as 'Let's examine the laws of bills of exchange',' he said.
While that brief may be too wide, others are likely to be taken up.
Among these are the legal liabilities of so-called shadow directors - those
who are not company directors but sometimes assume duties similar to
directors. Lord Donaldson said the term is often applied to company doctors
called in to help avoid a corporate collapse, but could be applied to a
commercial or investment bank working closely with a company being rescued.
The question has arisen as to what liability such individuals may have to
shareholders if things go wrong.
Another issue likely to be high on the agenda is the legal status of what
are known as netted positions in a liquidation.
Securities groups frequently have several simultaneous transactions with
each other so that they may be both creditor and debtor. These positions are
usually netted so that each group's exposure subtracts credits from debts.
But if a securities company were to fail with outstanding transactions, a
liquidator may well ask the debtors to repay all they owe while insisting
that the failed group's creditors accept repayment of something considerably
less than 100p in the pound.
Lord Donaldson said numerous requests had been received by businesses
wanting to know how to engage legally in specific transactions. In these
instances, he said, the panel would be looking at a broad range of similar
transactions in an attempt to reach a decision which would be applicable to
the activities of a broad range of market participants.

<TEXT>
NATIONAL Savings contributed Pounds 220m to government funding in June,
although Pounds 195m of this was due to accrued interest. Net sales were
just Pounds 25m, with gross sales of Pounds 604m offset by repayments of
Pounds 579m.
Index-linked savings certificates made the highest contribution, with Pounds
86m, followed by Capital Bonds at Pounds 32m.
The total amount invested in National Savings at the end of June was Pounds
44.8bn.

FT  19 JUL 93 / Elderly 'face cost difficulty on care'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ELDERLY PEOPLE are unlikely to be able to meet the cost of residential care
by selling their homes, a study for the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, an
independent research body, has found.
The report by Mr Ian Gibbs, of York University, says that only half of
pensioner households are owner-occupiers and just one in five lives in a
house worth more than Pounds 40,000.
Care bills can cost nearly Pounds 10,000 a year and nine out of 10 home
owners aged 75 or more could not afford the fees from their existing income.
Even if they sold their properties, seven out of 10 would still be unable to
afford the fees. Payments would involve spending capital as well as
investment income.

FT  19 JUL 93 / Shake-up of airtime selling at ITV
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SUBSTANTIAL shake-up in the selling of ITV advertising time will be
announced today with the creation of two super-sales houses, Raymond Snoddy
writes.
The changes will yield the ITV companies savings on overheads and research
costs.
Granada and Scottish Television are combining their sales operations in a
grouping which will include Grampian and Border Television.
Meridian Broadcasting, the ITV company for the south of England which has
been selling its own airtime since it took over from TVS on January 1, is
joining forces with HTV, the company for Wales and the west, in a 50-50
joint venture. It will also represent Westcountry, Channel and the Welsh
Fourth Channel.
The move leaves Carlton Television, holders of the London weekday franchise,
as the only one of the 15 ITV companies selling airtime on its own.
The deals have been approved by the Independent Television Commission which
has the power to prevent any ITV company or group of companies gaining a
dominant position in advertising sales.

FT  19 JUL 93 / Higher pay 'may prompt big rise in inflation'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A BIG rise in inflation is likely over the next year as the current period
of wage restraint comes to a halt, the Institute of Directors said in a
survey published yesterday. It also found that nearly all the companies
surveyed were not being hindered by the level of interest rates.
With only 52 per cent of companies saying they have given employees a pay
increase in the past 12 months, many businesses believe they will be forced
to bow to demands for higher pay as the economy recovers.
There is also scepticism about whether the government will stick to its
policy of restricting pay rises among its own employees.
More than a third of the 337 businesses polled in the survey think the
year-on-year increase in the retail prices index will rise above 4 per cent
by next June. In the year to last month it was 1.2 per cent, the lowest for
nearly 30 years.
The finding implies that the Treasury may have problems keeping its measure
of underlying inflation - the RPI excluding mortgage payments - under its 4
per cent target.
In contrast to the usual trend of complaints, 86 per cent of companies in
the survey said present interest rates, held at 6 per cent since January,
were 'not hindering' their businesses.
Underlining general economic uncertainties, 45 per cent of businesses
expected that the next move in interest rates would be up, while 49 per cent
said they would come down.
The survey, conducted last month, comes after subdued price pressures in
recent months and comments from some economists that inflation is dead.
The survey says: 'There is very little evidence that directors believe that
inflation is being brought under control once and for all.'
Only 7 per cent of those interviewed expected retail price inflation to be
less than 2 per cent by next June.
While many businesses are relaxed about the prospects of high import costs
forcing up inflation, the survey focuses on anxieties that prices throughout
the economy will move up during the next pay round.
This is partly due to the repercussions of the long period in which
private-sector pay settlements have been kept low, while a 1.5 per cent
ceiling has been enforced on pay rises for government employees.
Over the next six months, 38 per cent of companies expect to give a pay
rise, with a further 16 per cent anticipating one in January. Stronger
business confidence and a growth in the service industry in the second
quarter of the year has boosted hopes of economic recovery in London, a
survey for the London Chamber of Commerce and Industry found.
Nearly half of service companies said business had improved in recent
months, while only 15 per cent said sales had gone down. However, relatively
few companies expected to take on more employees in the coming months.

FT  19 JUL 93 / Major declines to rule out extension of VAT
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR yesterday declined to rule out further extending the scope of
value added tax, as he put improving Britain's competitiveness firmly at the
heart of the government's economic strategy.
Interviewed on BBC TV's On The Record programme, the prime minister said the
government had no current plans to extend VAT to items such as newspapers
and children's clothes, but it would be 'unwise . . . to rule anything
absolutely definitively in or absolutely definitively out'.
Speaking just two days after Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, admitted a
further extension in the scope of VAT was a possibility, Mr Major said the
government would reassess the position after it had taken 'more action' on
public expenditure.
Mr Clarke said during a visit to Christchurch, Dorset, that the government
might again broaden the VAT base if the acceleration in the economic
recovery did not make significant inroads in the government's borrowing
requirement.
The introduction of VAT on domestic heating, announced in the Budget in
spite of past statements that the government had no plans to make such a
move, has become a potent issue in the constituency where the Conservatives
are this month attempting to stave off a demoralising by-election defeat.
Mr Major used yesterday's interview to trumpet the government's recent
record in cutting inflation and interest rates and in engineering
'astounding' growth in manufacturing productivity.
But with key export markets such as Germany and France moving into
recession, it was crucial that UK competitiveness was improved further.
Britain was securing a larger share of a smaller European market, the prime
minister said. This underlined the 'absolute imperative' for Britain to
remain competitive - 'and that means relatively low wage increases'.
He said low pay rises ought to be popular with the unemployed because they
made it more likely that they would be 'priced back into jobs'.
One of the effects of the recession, he said, was to have 'stripped the
masking tape' from some of the country's strategic problems, making them
more evident.
Britain needed to expand, widen and deepen the industrial base and it needed
to examine the long-term difficulties it faced in funding all the social
expenditure it wanted to carry out.
Reflecting on a difficult year which has seen his personal popularity slump,
Mr Major said politics had been through a silly and sleazy period.

FT  19 JUL 93 / MPs attack 'Pounds 100m fees' over Maxwell collapse
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FEES LEVIED by accountants, lawyers and financial advisers working on the
Maxwell collapse could exceed Pounds 100m, a committee of MPs will suggest
today.
The Commons social security committee is expected to use a report on the
Maxwell pensioners to criticise the fees being charged by advisers and the
slow progress in retrieving funds on the pensioners' behalf.
Total fees charged have already exceeded Pounds 50m, the report will
indicate.
According to Mr David Shaw, Conservative MP for Dover and a committee
member, MPs expressed concern about fees and difficulties in tracing
ownership of missing pension-fund assets while hearing evidence.
Goldman Sachs, the US bank which dealt extensively for Robert Maxwell's
family and its companies, may be criticised. It emerged last week that the
bank had been asked to pay up to Pounds 56m to two pension schemes formerly
controlled by Maxwell.
The requests relate to transactions in 1990 in which Goldman acted as
purchaser for shares in Maxwell Communication Corporation from the Mirror
Group Pension Scheme and the Maxwell Communication Corporation Staff Scheme.
In May, the committee was told that two City investment banks were blocking
efforts by liquidators of the Maxwell pension fund management company to
trace the ownership of nearly Pounds 130m in missing assets.

FT  19 JUL 93 / Receivers agree deal for Daf offshoots
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RECEIVERS of the former Anglo-Dutch truckmaker Leyland Daf said at the
weekend they had reached agreement on the future of the six African
assembly, service and distribution subsidiaries.
Mr John Talbot and Mr Murdoch McKillop, the joint Arthur Andersen receivers,
said the new local owners would continue trading in Leyland Daf vehicles, as
they have throughout the receivership.
The receivers would not give details of the new ownership arrangements,
which in most cases are expected to involve some state interests. The
subsidiaries are in Ghana, Zambia, Malawi, Tanzania, Uganda and Zimbabwe.
The companies have been operating on a small scale, with combined sales
believed to have been about 500 trucks last year, and the companies' sale is
expected to raise only Pounds 5m to Pounds 10m for the receivers.
The African deal means that only the future of Multipart, the parts
warehousing and distribution business in Chorley, Lancashire, has still to
be decided. Leyland Trucks, the Lancashire-based manufacturing company now
owned and operated by a management buy-out team, believes it can start
working more closely with the African operations to expand production and
sales.
Mr Stuart Heys, Leyland Trucks' commercial director, said yesterday: 'We are
now involved in discussions with the new owners of these businesses
concerning our future working relationship.'

MR Peter Brooke, the National Heritage secretary, will tell the Arts Council

He will make a Commons statement following last month's report from Price
Waterhouse, the accountancy firm, which showed that the council spends 10p
on administration out of every Pounds 1 it receives for the arts.
Mr Brooke is unlikely to recommend any of the radical options proposed by
Price Waterhouse. These include streamlining the council's structure by
cutting the number of posts by 100 to about 50, saving Pounds 2.2m a year.
Price Waterhouse also suggested that disposing of the council's present
premises would save at least Pounds 1.3m.
Last year the Arts Council distributed Pounds 225m for arts projects.

The changes will yield the ITV companies savings on overheads and research
costs, and could could give the grouped-together ITV companies more clout
with advertisers.
Granada and Scottish Television are combining their sales operations in a
grouping which will include Grampian and Border Television.
Meridian Broadcasting, the ITV company for the south of England which has
been selling its own airtime since it took over from TVS on January 1, is
joining forces with HTV, the company for Wales and the west, in a 50-50
joint venture. It will also represent Westcountry, Channel and the Welsh
Fourth Channel.
The move means there will now be four main sales houses selling most of the
ITV advertising time. In addition to the two new joint ventures, neither of
which has a name yet, there is TSMS, which links Central, Anglia and Ulster.
Earlier this year London Weekend Television took a stake in Yorkshire
Tyne-Tees and at the same time announced that the London company would in
future be selling Yorkshire Tyne-Tees air time.
The move leaves Carlton Television, holders of the London weekday franchise,
as the only one of the 15 ITV companies selling airtime on its own.
The deals have been approved by the Independent Television Commission which
has the power to prevent any ITV company or group of companies gaining a
dominant position in advertising sales. The ITC is reluctant to allow any
group more than a 15 per cent market share. The four sales houses have about
20 per cent each.

Mr Saburo Tsukamoto, former chairman of the Democratic Socialist party, was
another victim of the rush of votes to new reformist groups and, it seems,
of links to scandals present and past.
Mr Tsukamoto said he had expected a tough election race, thanks to scandals
involving DSP municipal representatives. Mr Tsukamoto himself was forced to
resign from party chairmanship in 1989 because of his involvement in the
Recruit scandal.

How candidates fared

   By ROBERT THOMSON and EMIKO TERAZANO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After an uphill struggle Mr Nobuteru Ishihara, the LDP's youngest candidate,
was re-elected in one of the country's most hotly contested constituencies.
Mr Ishihara is the son of Mr Shintaro Ishihara, former transport minister
and co-author of A Japan That Can Say No.
Mr Ishihara junior was one of the 12 candidates competing for five seats.
The constituency in central Tokyo has a youthful and shifting population and
is fickle in its political choices.
However, using the celebrity links of his uncle, Mr Yujiro Ishihara, a movie
star who passed away seven years ago, he has managed to capture the
electorate. Nonetheless, the district's tendency to vote in line with
overall trends has hurt the Social Democrats, who lost two seats.
His outspoken father was also re-elected, coming in first in his
constituency.

<TEXT>
Mr Takao Fujinami, a former chief cabinet secretary on trial for alleged
bribe-taking, had said his re-election would be proof that local voters
thought him innocent. Mr Fujinami yesterday lost his seat in Mie prefecture,
in central Japan.
He was elected in 1990 even though he had been indicted after the
investigation into the Recruit stocks-for-favours scandal, for which he was
seen as the politician taking the punishment on behalf of his party, the
LDP. This time, standing as an independent, he failed because his old party
unsympathetically put two strong candidates against him.
But the Fujinami name will survive in Mie. His family is famous for making
sweet bean dumplings, named Rikyu in honour of a tea ceremony master. After
the scandal broke, the locals started calling them Recruit dumplings.

<TEXT>
Old ways die hard in the most conservative regions of Japan. Mr Noboru
Takeshita, former prime minister, was re-elected yesterday at the top of
Shimane's list of candidates, with over 100,000 votes.
For many Japanese, Mr Takeshita symbolises the corrupt ways of the country's
politics. He was forced out of office after being linked to the Recruit
stocks-for-favours scandal in 1989 and, more recently, public criticism
mounted after revelations of his links to gangsters.
However, among his electorate, he remains the pride of Shimane, a rural
prefecture in western Japan.
The region lacks any big industries and is sparsely populated but, thanks to
Mr Takeshita, has the most public works spending allocated per capita.
His supporters will consider Mr Takeshita's victory as a 'purification'
after all the scandals.

Ms Yuriko Koike, star of television and the Japan New party, was elected
comfortably, as was Ms Takako Doi, the former Socialist leader, both in the
western constituency of Hyogo.
Ms Koike is likely to be the deputy parliamentary head of her party, while
there were calls last night from within Ms Doi's depleted party for her to
return as SDP leader.
Both MPs say they support 'political reform', but have very different views
on its meaning. Ms Doi would like her party to reform, though she was
unwilling to change some of its cherished but unpopular foreign policy and
unable to draft an alternative economic policy.
Ms Koike wants electoral boundaries to be redrawn, making politics less
expensive and less prone to financial scandal.
She is also pushing for an overhaul of parliamentary style, saying 'there's
no real debate in the parliament'.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
VOTER turnout for yesterday's general election fell to a near record low,
suggesting that the political fervour of the campaign was not enough to
inspire some Japanese to make a trip to the polling stations.
Before the election, the furore over the fall of the government seemed to
heighten interest among the electorate. However, only an estimated 67.2 per
cent turned out to the polls. The figure is 6 percentage points lower than
the previous election in 1990 and 5 points lower than the average of the
past 18 elections.
While some analysts blamed a televised sumo final and bad weather, the lack
of issues directly concerning the ordinary voter is seen as the main reason
for the low interest. Calls for political reform dominated the platforms of
most parties, and some voters seemed to be turned off by the absence of
debate over issues such as tax reform and the controversial dispatch of
Japanese troops to United Nations peacekeeping operations.
Polls taken just before the election indicated that 43 per cent of the
electorate had not decided who to vote for. The new reformist parties which
have splintered from the ruling Liberal Democratic party has confused many
voters.
Apathy was most prominent among urban voters, with the turnout around or
below 60 per cent in Tokyo and surrounding areas such as Chiba and Saitama.
In contrast, rural Japan, which has a high proportion of faithful LDP
supporters, saw a large turnout. Over 77 per cent visited the polls in
Shimane, the constituency of Mr Noboru Takeshita, a former prime minister.

FT  19 JUL 93 / The Japanese Election: End of an era as the heavyweights
clash - A confused electorate finds sumo wrestling more clear-cut than
politics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GATHERED around an oversized video screen in the Ginza shopping district,
several hundred people watched and gasped yesterday as the spectacle of
battle unfolded before them, certain that, whatever the outcome, Japan had
entered a new era.
Instead of the white gloves of campaigning politicians, the combatants on
the screen wore the scant mawashi of the sumo wrestler, as the finale of a
national tournament was played out by three contestants, one of them
American, who are symbols of the passing of the old order in Japan.
At least the outcome of the sumo tournament was clear: the American,
Akebono, won.
When Japanese went to bed last night, they knew the Liberal Democratic party
had lost its majority and the largest opposition party, the Social
Democratic party, had been humbled, but they didn't know who was running the
country.
'I don't care who is the leader, as long as the LDP is punished,' a young
man watching the sumo explained. But a nearby young woman said all she
wanted was the replacement of Mr Kiichi Miyazawa as prime minister: 'That's
the most important thing.'
The confusion and the conflicting opinions have been stirred by the rise of
two parties, the Japan New party and the Japan Renewal party, a former
faction of the LDP, which has a large share of the balance of power.
Mr Tsutomu Hata, the JRP leader, shared an ailment with the leaders of the
parties with which he may form a coalition government. They had cracked,
hoarse voices after two weeks of the constant speechmaking and loud
hailer-shouting that is campaigning in Japan.
'I'm very happy that the people have given us such support,' rasped Mr Hata.
But the JRP leader, who prides himself on his straight talking, was as vague
as other party leaders when it came to describing the likely form of the new
government: 'There will need to be a lot of discussion.'
Before the discussion started, the rumours circulated. An opposition party
leader who had promised to form a coalition with the JRP was talking openly
of joining an LDP-led coalition government. The JNP was said to be swinging
both ways, towards a partnership with the JRP and with the LDP.
With the politicians being politicians, the sumo wrestlers had a drawing
power of their own yesterday. A record low voting turnout, estimated
provisionally at 67 per cent, was partly blamed on apathy, partly on the
miserable weather, and partly on the attraction of the sumo.

<TEXT>
Japanese politics is a family affair, with seats often left to sons,
daughters and even to a son-in-law. Ms Makiko Tanaka is the daughter of Mr
Kakuei Tanaka, a former prime minister and a founder of the Liberal
Democratic party's largest faction, the split of which led to the fall of
the Miyazawa government.
Makiko Tanaka stood and won in her father's old electorate of Niigata,
having announced her candidacy at the family's bus company, Echigo Kotsu,
which has been assisted by the many new roads and bridges built in Niigata
during the reign of the scandal-stained Mr Tanaka.
With her father's political support group officially disbanded, Ms Tanaka
rounded up the remnants, and stood as an independent, as local LDP officials
opposed her candidacy. Her success, she says, was due to 'the continuing
respect for my father' and to support for 'my concerns for ordinary people'.

FT  19 JUL 93 / The Japanese Election: Mould cracked but not yet broken -
Liberal Democrats lose their majority for the first time since 1955
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN is embarking on a period of political restructuring without precedent
since the end of the second world war, when the merger of two pre-war
parties gave birth to the Liberal Democratic party, which has ruled since
1955.
The 1955 mould of post-war Japanese politics was not broken by yesterday's
general election but it was cracked, possibly permanently.
It is too early to say that the new conservative parties which were the main
winners yesterday will provide the Japanese public with a new choice, as
permanent alternatives to the ruling Liberal Democratic party and the
socialist opposition.
But the new parties - the Japan Renewal party, Japan New party and Harbinger
party - did well enough to hold the balance of power in the next parliament,
to press for political reforms and to lay the foundations for becoming an
independent third force at subsequent elections.
Their success reflects more than disaffection with the scandal-ridden LDP
and disillusion with the impotence and ideologically hidebound nature of the
older opposition parties.
It stems from an appetite for change, which has not been entirely
extinguished by the cynicism forced on voters by repeated political
scandals. Younger, independent urban voters crave not just new party labels
and leaders, but a more open style of politics, which deals in debate and
ideas.
Yet it is far from certain that is what they will get.
Even though the LDP has lost its overall majority in the parliament's lower
house, it delivered a telling display of electoral resilience. It maintained
its strength in spite of its failure to introduce political reforms, the
worst economic downturn for 20 years, a deeply unpopular prime minister, and
rumbling scandals which are due to surface in court again this week.
As Japan moves into a possibly extended period of coalition government, the
LDP is likely to be the largest party and so the central building block for
any coalition. The endless war within the party, between its factions for
positions and patronage, will be complicated by jostling between the LDP and
its potential coalition partners.
The scope for Japanese politics being decided by shady deals in smoke-filled
hotel rooms has probably grown as a result of this election, not diminished.
Hopes that the election could set in train sweeping and lasting changes in
the Japanese political system rest with two developments.
First, the next government is almost certain to focus on political reforms.
These are likely to include changes to the electoral system involving the
introduction of proportional representation, designed to encourage more open
debate about national policies and priorities. Political reform will throw
the system into a protracted period of turmoil as parties adjust to the
unfamiliar rules.
This flux should be advantageous to the new conservatives who will enter the
next election with more money and candidates.
Second, much depends on the vision and determination of the new parties'
leaders. They have established an impressive electoral beach-head, which
will attract further supporters and donations from the business community.
But to extend beyond that to become a viable alternative to the LDP will be
long, hard work.
The collapse of the socialists' support has probably robbed the Japan
Renewal party of the hopes it had a month ago of leading an opposition
coalition to dislodge the LDP.
The LDP's resilience means the new conservatives can harbour few hopes of
winning seats from the ruling party. They will grow quickest at the expense
of their erstwhile partners, the ailing Social Democratic party.
So this election could set the scene for an intensifying battle within the
opposition, rather than between the opposition and the LDP. The balance of
power within the opposition will have to shift, away from the left and
towards the centre, before the LDP will face a credible challenge from an
alternative coalition.
Yet today the leaders of the new conservative parties will not be worrying
over such distant doubts about their prospects. The LDP may not be turfed
out of power; it will almost certainly have to share power for the first
time for almost four decades.
Flushed with their success the new conservatives know that in spite of the
LDP's size, they will be setting the pace in Japanese politics.

<TEXT>
The Japanese constitution says that an extraordinary parliamentary session
to elect Japan's next prime minister must be called within 30 days of the
general election, writes Emiko Terazono.
Extensive negotiations between parties to decide on details of a new
coalition may take up to a month, preventing the Diet from convening before
the August 16 deadline. It has usually taken more than 18 days for parties
to convene the past 16 special parliamentary sessions following general
elections.
After the special session is convened, there is no time limit for the
election of the prime minister. In 1979, the session took a record eight
days to elect Mr Masayoshi Ohira because of friction within the Liberal
Democratic party.

FT  19 JUL 93 / The Japanese Election: Leaders get ready for horse-trading /
A look at prospects good and bad for the parties and the people
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S political leaders, old and new, were counting heads early today in
preparation for the horse-trading that will determine the shape of the next
government. With the Liberal Democratic party having lost its majority,
leaders were deciding whom they would back in a coalition and at what price.
For the old leaders, the poor results may force resignation. Mr Kiichi
Miyazawa, the LDP leader, apologised for having brought distress to the
party, while Mr Sadao Yamahana, head of the Social Democratic party, the
largest opposition party, saw half of his MP lose their seats and was
'contemplating' his political future.
Meanwhile, Mr Tsutomu Hata, head of the Japan Renewal party, and Mr Morihiro
Hosokawa, the Japan New party leader, suddenly find themselves with the
power to create a government. If the two parties join forces, along with the
SDP and other opposition partners, they will have the numbers to force the
LDP into opposition for the first time since 1955.
LDP officials were hoping that Mr Hosokawa, who has kept his intentions
vague, will join it in a coalition in return for a senior post in a new
government. After noting that the LDP will not be able to form a government,
Mr Hosokawa said: 'I will have to consult my members before making a
decision.'
Mr Hata, whose defection from the LDP prompted the election, said he would
not rejoin the party, though some JRP officials have indicated that, if made
prime minister, Mr Hata might accept a coalition with the LDP or the SDP.
Whichever way he turns, Mr Hata may find his time at the top is short.
The arithmetic is made more complicated by the possibility of further splits
from the LDP or a break-up of the SDP. By law, parliament has to convene
within 30 days, giving leaders the luxury of time in mixing and matching the
nine main parties in the quest for a majority of the 511 seats.
Smaller opposition parties were being cagey. The Democratic Socialist party,
with 15 members elected, had offered support for the SDP and JRP in a
coalition, but last night hinted that it would back the LDP.
The generally isolated Japan Communist party, also with 15 members, could
also find itself being courted for an opposition coalition.
The prospect of a coalition including the left-wing socialists and the
relatively right-wing JRP, with the communists thrown in to make up the
numbers, gives an indication of the potential instability in coming months.
Yesterday's election has set the scene for the next one, expected within a
year.
If the LDP again takes office, it could be brought down by the opposition
parties in coalition. The JRP, which did not have enough time to recruit
candidates this time around, is already preparing for the next election,
when it will have many more than the 69 representatives who stood yesterday.
The results suggest that Japanese politics have changed irrevocably, and yet
the battered structure could return to its old shape.
One of the new parties could join forces with the LDP, as has happened in
the past, and public anger over political scandal could fade, leaving a
dominant LDP surrounded by a clutch of directionless opposition parties.
LDP officials, knowing their party would lose its majority, were generally
hopeful that the election has allowed voters to express their anger. The
theory is that the party will recover lost seats at the next election, as
the newer parties will no longer be able to campaign only on the issue of
'reform' and will be forced to detail policies on such divisive issues such
as foreign policy and taxation.
Having successfully presented themselves as an alternative to the SDP, the
newer parties, the JNP and JRP, must next prove that they are an alternative
to the LDP, which they have not yet done. Most of their votes have come from
the SDP, which gained in the past from disgruntlement with the LDP but which
has been content with its role as an opposition party never likely to rule.
The form of the new government is likely to be determined more by
personalities than by policy or ideology.
The resignation of Mr Miyazawa will make it easier for one of the opposition
parties to join the LDP in a coalition, as exit polls yesterday suggested
that 85 per cent of voters want him to resign.
A likely successor is Mr Toshiki Kaifu, a former prime minister with a
reputation as a reformer. He was dumped by the LDP two years ago after
suggesting reforms to the electoral structure, the issue which triggered the
election last month. Officials at the JRP and JNP have suggested that Mr
Kaifu is preferable to Mr Miyazawa, but have not given commitments of
support.
The appointment of Mr Kaifu as head of a coalition will not necessarily
bring stability or reform. Like Mr Miyazawa, he does not have the support
within the party to demand that other factions do his bidding.
Mr Kaifu is seen by the heads of the LDP's larger factions as a socially
acceptable leader capable of guiding the party through political turbulence
 -and back to the good old days, when there was an orderly queue for the
prime ministership.

FT  19 JUL 93 / Economists urge further India reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALEXANDER NICOLL, Asia Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE benefits gained by India from economic reforms already undertaken may be
meagre unless they are followed by further steps to complete the
transformation of economic policy, according to a new report.
The report's authors - Mr Jagdish Bhagwati and Mr T N Srinivasan, professors
of economics at Columbia University and Yale University respectively -
strongly support the reforms introduced by Finance Minister Manmohan Singh,
who commissioned the report. But they say that increases in productivity and
exports may be small without additional measures.
Among reforms they recommend are further cuts in the budget deficit by
widening the tax base, using privatisation proceeds to retire government
debt and cut interest costs, and ending financing of the deficit through the
banking system.
The government promises to restructure the tax system but, because of
political sensitivities, has not yet embraced full privatisation of public
sector enterprises and has only partially reduced the funding demands it
makes on banks. It plans reform of the financial sector for which, the
economists say, 'the need can hardly be over-emphasised'.
In industry, the report notes that bureaucratic restrictions remain even
though the government has swept away the need for official licensing of
corporate decisions. 'State-level restrictions continue largely in place and
need to be removed if delicensing is to amount to much,' the professors say.
Imports should be further liberalised and tariffs reduced and unified,
although these measures should be balanced by new mechanisms to deal with
dumping and 'import surges'.
To encourage foreign investment, India must join trade blocs and should
accept a compromise with the US and other industrialised countries on
intellectual property rules. 'Multinationals now treat the acceptance of
such rules as an index of the seriousness of a country in attracting direct
foreign investment,' the economists say.
Their most straightforward advice concerns the huge and inefficient public
sector.
The government should promote competition and privatisation, it should start
no new public sector enterprises except in cases of clearly established
social need, and it should stop buying sick industries.
They note: 'The lessons of unhappy experience with public sector enterprises
in all sorts of countries with diverse social and cultural traditions
suggest that it is extremely hard to make them function efficiently.'
The professors recommend the complete and quick removal of subsidies on
fertiliser, irrigation and electricity, as well as of subsidised interest
rates for farm credits which, they say, mainly help farmers who are not
poor. Instead, they advocate the establishment of institutions such as
Grameen Bank, which has been successful in making loans to small farmers in
Bangladesh.
Government schemes which help the poor should be better targeted, the report
adds.

FT  19 JUL 93 / Divining the motives for US Japan-bashing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD BALLS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NEW Japanese government, whenever it finally emerges, had better prepare
for battle. Friday's news that Japan's trade surplus was nearly a fifth
higher in the first half of this year, compared with the same period a year
ago, will only strengthen the resolve of US administration officials who
want to see quantitive targets added to the wordy text of the recent
bilateral trade agreement.
Japanese bureaucrats at the Ministry of Finance strongly deny that there is
any further ground to give, especially on targets for imports in the
particular industrial sectors listed in the agreement, arguing that anything
more specific would quickly lead to pressure for bilateral, managed trade.
The agreement currently commits Japan to 'actively pursue' demand-led
growth, which is 'intended to achieve over the medium term a highly
significant decrease in the current account surplus'. Now, they say, let us
get on with it.
But senior US officials say the agreement, reached with a lame-duck Japanese
prime minister at the end of the recent summit of industrial country
leaders, was only the first round. US negotiators want to be able to measure
the extent to which Japan is taking active steps to expand domestic demand
and reduce trade restrictions by monitoring quantitive targets for the
current account surplus and the share of imports in gross domestic product.
Only now, with the Japanese election result declared and the new government
in the process of taking shape, might the true US motives become apparent.
The kind of agreement that emerges from the next round of negotiation should
reveal whether the US is really attempting to use its bilateral clout to
open up the Japanese market to exports from all countries, as it claims, or
whether it wants to target the performance of US exports to Japan, perhaps
even at a sectoral level, in order to increase the slice its exporters take
from a larger Japanese import cake.
The official US line is the former. Much of the evidence does appear to
suggest that Japanese markets are still relatively closed: imports are
equivalent to just 3.2 per cent of gross domestic product, less than half
the ratio in the US, Germany and Britain as well as Canada. Developing
country exports account for only 1.8 per cent of total Japanese consumption
of manufactures, compared to 2,9 per cent in the EC and 4.1 per cent in the
US. So if quantitive targets can be employed to stop what Washington alleges
is Japanese trade management through implicit import barriers and instead
stimulate domestic demand to suck in imports and reduce the current account
surplus, the gains will be felt multilaterally.
Yet, if the US administration's motives are really multilateral and
free-trade spirited, why has it chosen to pursue the matter bilaterally
rather than multilaterally? For if the Japanese trade surplus really does
reduce employment in other countries by reducing their exports, the evidence
does not suggests that it is the US which loses the most.
The US may have the largest absolute trade deficit with Japan, measured in
dollars. But when the size of the deficit is measured relative to GDP or
total trade with Japan, the US barely makes the top ten, as the charts show.
Eight countries plus the EC have a larger bilateral deficit than the US
relative to their total trade with Japan. Hong Kong's deficit is three times
as large relative to total trade than the American deficit. Relative to GDP,
the US deficit fades into insignificance compared to Hong Kong and
Singapore. The US deficit with Japan is equal to 0.7 per cent of GDP in
1991, while Singapore had a deficit equal to 22 per cent of GDP.
Indeed the top five deficit countries - Singapore, Hong Kong, Thailand,
South Korea and Malaysia - all had much larger bilateral deficits with Japan
and also, compared with the US, posted far faster growth rates of both GDP
and exports and far lower unemployment rates. All of which must put a large
question-mark over US and EC claims that it is Japan's trade surplus which
is to blame for their multiple domestic economic problems.

Due to the introduction of the single market, EC countries are
currently changing to a new system of compiling trade statistics. All
trade figures are seasonally adjusted, except for the Italian series
and the German current account. Imports can be derived by subtracting
the visible trade balance from exports. Export and import data are
calculated on the FOB (free on board) basis, except for German and
Italian imports which use the CIF (including carriage, insurance and
freight charges) method. German data up to and including June 1990,
shown in italics, refer to the former West Germany. The nominal

FT  19 JUL 93 / Italy, UN agree temporary truce: Row over peacekeeping in
Somalia shifts to diplomacy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THE row between Italy and the United Nations over the conduct of
peacekeeping forces in Somalia shifted over the weekend from public
posturing to quiet diplomacy.
The differences are to be discussed at a meeting on July 27 between Mr
Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary-general, and Mr Bruno Bottai,
director-general of the Italian Foreign Ministry. Until then all parties are
expected to observe a cooling-off period.
The decision to hold a top-level meeting with the UN secretary-general
followed urgent talks on Friday in Mogadishu, the Somali capital, between
Italian diplomats and Admiral Jonathon Howe, Mr Boutros Ghali's special
envoy, General Cevik Bir, the Turkish commander of UN forces, and US
diplomats.
Neither side was willing to comment on the talks - in contrast to the mutual
criticism traded earlier between the UN and the Italian government. The sole
outcome was the formal announcement of the July 27 meeting.
Mr Koffi Annan, in charge of all UN peacekeeping operations, had called for
the removal of General Bruno Loi, commander of the 2,600-strong Italian
contingent in Somalia, claiming he had defied UN orders.
The Italians gave their backing to Gen Loi, refused to call him home and
reiterated their criticism of the way UN operations in Somalia had shifted
from a peacekeeping and humanitarian role to enforcement. They feared this
risked turning the UN force toward an unwelcome occupational role, with its
impartiality surrendered by the US-sponsored call to outlaw General Mohammed
Farah Aideed, the principal Somali warlord.
From Mogadishu, Reuter reports that Italian troops clashed yesterday with
Somali gunmen at a checkpoint in the capital.
Italian sources said gunmen who had hijacked a bus opened fire when the
vehicle was stopped and the Italian troops shot back.
A Somali man and a woman were wounded, apparently by fire from the gunmen,
the sources said.
Meanwhile, in Germany leading politicians within the ruling coalition began
to question German involvement in Somalia just as 250 soldiers prepared to
join peacekeepers there.
Speaking in the Cologne-based Express newspaper, Mr Karl Lamers, spokesman
for the foreign affairs committee of the Christian Democratic parliamentary
group, said a clarification of the UN mandate in Somalia was urgently
needed.
Mr Lamers, who has been a strong advocate of German participation in UN
missions outside Nato, said: 'If the UN mandate is not clarified shortly, a
new situation would appear in which the withdrawal of German soldiers would
become necessary.'
In an interview in Die Welt published today, Mr Klaus Kinkel, foreign
affairs minister and a member of the Free Democrats, the junior party in the
coalition, added that the situation in Somalia should be continuously
examined to see if the politically agreed conditions for German involvement
had not changed. However, he added German soldiers should not withdraw 'when
the first difficulties arise'.
The federal constitutional court recently approved German participation in
UN peacekeeping missions in Somalia after the government coalition said the
soldiers would be kept out of particularly dangerous zones.

FT  19 JUL 93 / Central bank action boosts Chinese yuan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LYNNE O'DONNELL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BEIJING
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Chinese yuan rose 18 per cent against the US dollar last week after the
central bank poured more than Dollars 100m (Pounds 66.6m) into the money
market.
The yuan closed on Friday at Yn8.65 to the dollar; last month it had been
trading at almost Yn11 to the dollar at China's semi-official swap centres.
Chinese efforts to encourage people to save with banks, rather than
concealing money at home, is paying off. Banks say that since interest rates
on savings and fixed-term deposits were lifted on July 11 they have been so
overwhelmed that hours have had to be extended.
Lending and deposit rates were lifted by an average 1.38 and 1.72 percentage
points, and the one-year fixed-term deposit rate moved up to 10.98 per cent
in an attempt to encourage cash-strapped companies to repatriate hard
currency to obtain yuan liquidity.
The interest rate increase was in tandem with a nationwide campaign to
attract greater savings deposits from the population, historically
suspicious of state financial institutions and believed to be hoarding
millions of yuan in tea caddies and mattresses. China has recently admitted
that banks are short of cash.
The Beijing branch of the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China had its
busiest day on record the day rates went up, according to the official China
Daily newspaper, when new savings hit Yn61m (Pounds 7m).
The interest rate rise was one of the first steps taken by Mr Zhu Rongji,
senior vice-premier, when he took on the extra role of governor of the Bank
of China. In an attempt to cool the overheating economy and control
inflation now running at 20 per cent in urban centres, Mr Zhu has taken
steps to curb bank lending.
Meanwhile, the Hong Kong-based Ming Pao Daily News said the central bank was
determined to strengthen the yuan to Yn8.3 to the dollar 'and will pay any
price for it'.
Quoting a Chinese finance official, the pro-Beijing newspaper said China
aimed to achieve its target rate within the next six months - which would
bring the yuan one step closer to the final target value of Yn8 to the
dollar.
The black market price remains at about Yn9 to the dollar, while the
official rate is Yn5.7 to the dollar.

FT  19 JUL 93 / UN sees progress in Iraqi missile talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Foreign Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SENIOR UN envoy said last night he and Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq
Aziz had made progress in talks to defuse a weapons crisis.
'I think we have cleared a large number of issues so now we have to conclude
and to sum up the results,' Mr Rolf Ekeus said after a meeting in Baghdad
with Mr Aziz, aimed at ending the impasse over UN demands for monitoring of
two missile-testing sites.
He said the two sides would conclude the discussions today.
The talks were unexpectedly joined by Mr Riyadh al-Qaysi, the Foreign
Ministry official who returned late last week from heading an Iraqi
delegation to the UN in New York, for talks on allowing a limited exception
to the post-Gulf war ban on the country's oil sales.
Mr Ekeus earlier said he could draw no conclusion from Mr al-Qaysi's
attendance. But the official's inclusion marks the first time Iraq has
directly linked the two UN negotiations and suggests Baghdad is seeking a
broader understanding rather than simply a solution to the missiles
stand-off.
The oil talks were suspended at Mr al-Qaysi's request. But UN diplomats
suggested the two sides had produced a draft text of an agreement.

345km railway would cut transit time from Taipei to Kaoshiung to less than
two hours, from more than four hours now.

INDIA has expressed regret at Russia's decision to freeze a Dollars 350m
(Pounds 233m) contract to supply cryogenic rocket engines and associated
technology for India's civilian space programme but emphasised that it would
cause no setback.
Foreign ministry officials expressed dismay that Russia has 'yielded so
blatantly to US pressure' to go back on its 1991 contract with India but a
ministry statement at the weekend avoided direct criticism of the US. 'While
India remains willing to co-operate with other countries in the space sector
for mutual benefit, it will continue to develop the required technologies
indigenously,' it said.
Mr Dinesh Singh, India's foreign minister, told a parliamentary committee
meeting on Saturday night that, though he did not see 'an overall shift' in
US policy towards India, the US's decisions would be based 'on their
self-interest as they see it'.
Mr Michael McCurry, US state department spokesman, said Moscow's
co-operation in blocking the transfer of 'significant' technology to India
about which the US 'had concerns' could be 'worth billions of dollars'.
Dr Raja Ramanna, former head of India's Atomic Energy Commission, challenged
the US position that the transfer of cryogenic technology was a violation of
the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR). 'Everyone knows that cryogenic
engines cannot be used for defence purposes, and I cannot understand why
such a powerful country (like the US) should feel so insecure about India
getting some knowhow,' he said.

<TEXT>
A HIGH-LEVEL delegation from the US has left Vietnam with an agreement to
base three State Department officials in Hanoi. They will be the first US
diplomats in Vietnam since the end of the war in 1975.
The agreement was reached after three days of talks in Hanoi with ministers
and other senior Vietnamese officials. The diplomats will work with US
military personnel in Vietnam searching for evidence on the fate of
servicemen listed as missing in action (MIA).
For Vietnam, Deputy Foreign Minister Le Mai said his government has accepted
the proposal, although he said some technical questions had still to be
resolved.
Mr Winston Lord, the US assistant secretary of state who led the delegation,
stressed the three officials would be in Vietnam strictly to work on the MIA
issue. However, Vietnamese officials said privately they hoped the move
would make diplomatic exchanges between the two countries easier and lead to
a gradual improvement in relations.
The US delegation said the diplomats would also 'support American citizens,
including families of our missing and the Vietnam veterans who have been
invited by the Vietnamese government to visit Vietnam'.
President Bill Clinton ordered the US delegation to Vietnam to assess local
co-operation in the search for MIAs. Hanoi says it is already doing all it
can, but many Americans are not convinced and Mr Clinton has said there must
be tangible progress on the issue before relations between the two countries
can be normalised.
Mr Lord and his colleagues said at the end of their visit that they were
pleased with the assurances they had received. However, the four
representatives of Vietnam war veterans' groups in the delegation said they
would not be convinced until they saw some concrete results.
The Vietnamese government believes that, with US diplomatic representation
in Hanoi and with Mr Clinton's recent decision to unblock international
lending, the process of normalisation with the US has taken a big step
forward.
Vietnamese officials are now hoping for the US trade embargo to be lifted.
This comes up for renewal on September 14 and Mr Clinton is under pressure
from US business interests to let them into Vietnam.

FT  19 JUL 93 / Estonia brushes off Russian vote for autonomy

<TEXT>
ESTONIA'S Russified north-east corner, smarting over the country's language
and citizenship laws, at the weekend voted heavily in favour of regional
autonomy.
Early results from Narva, the industrial border town, showed 97.2 per cent
of voters in favour of territorial autonomy within Estonia, the Russian
Itar-Tass news agency reported. Nearby Sillamae counted 98.6 per cent.
But the weight of the result may be diluted by the low turnout, reported to
be 54 per cent in Narva.
The Estonian government issued a statement claiming that less than 50 per
cent of registered voters had participated in the referendum. Under Russian
law, and former Soviet law, a turnout of less than 50 per cent would make
the referendum invalid.
But the Estonian government has anyway declared the vote illegal, and vowed
to protect its territorial integrity.
The referendum was called after the Estonian parliament passed an aliens law
which many in the Russian minority consider discriminatory. The law was
amended last weekend to meet concerns voiced by the Council of Europe and
the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, but Russian leaders
dismissed the changes as cosmetic.
Mr Vladimir Chukhin, chairman of the Narva city council and organiser of the
referendum, told Russian radio that the vote would at least force the
Estonia government to negotiate with the Russian community, which accounts
for 600,000 of Estonia's 1.6m people, over the aliens law.
The Russified region has always been part of Estonia.
Russia last week cut off oil supplies to Belarus, the former Soviet republic
which has kept close ties with Moscow, Lithuania's state news agency, ELTA,
reported at the weekend. Belarus owes Russia Rbs72bn, despite a 50 per cent
subsidy. Belarus paid Rbs10bn on July 15. Natural gas supplies to the three
Baltic countries were cut off last month, but pipelines were opened once the
states paid their bill.

Moscow sent military reinforcements to the troubled central Asian republic

Moslem opponents threatens to involve Russia, Chrystia Freeland writes from
Moscow. The move came as the Russian news agency Itar-Tass reported that 40
rebels and five government soldiers had been killed in a clash during a
rebel raid on a village.
Tensions rose last week after the Tajik opposition forces, aided by seasoned
mujahideen fighters from neighbouring Afghanistan, killed 25 Russian
soldiers in a shoot-out on the Tajik-Afghan border.
Kabul accused Russia of mounting a retaliatory attack against Afghan
villages close to the border in which they say more than 80 people were
killed or injured.
Russian and Tajik officials deny the charges, but over the weekend top
Russian military leaders vowed to crack down on the Tajik opposition.

Officials of the three main groupings involved in the conflict said at the
end of a week of negotiations that the accord would be formally signed by

The groups said sticking points remained, but they were confident that
agreement could be reached on these over the coming week. According to a
communique signed by the three groups, a transitional government
representing all the factions would be set up and a United
Nations-supervised ceasefire would go into effect after next week's Cotonou

FT  19 JUL 93 / Stark change of style at the New York Fed: Richard Waters
meets the quiet career banker charged with maintaining financial stability
in the US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR William McDonough hardly seems a natural choice for the job of chief
fire-fighter for the US financial system. A 59-year-old with a distinguished
if unremarkable career in commercial banking, he is quiet, even hesitant.
In response to questions last week he was reserved and cautious, only
relaxing when explaining the shortcomings of economic data or talking about
his native Chicago. Yet as president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New
York, a job he takes on today, Mr McDonough is the man most responsible for
protecting the stability of the US financial system.
The change in style at the top of the New York Fed could hardly be starker.
Mr McDonough succeeds the man who was responsible for bringing him to the
bank only 18 months ago, Mr Gerald Corrigan. After eight years as the US's
second-most powerful central banker, and still only 52, Mr Corrigan has
built a formidable reputation around the world. Forceful, energetic,
eloquent, it was career central banker Mr Corrigan who led the efforts to
patch up the financial system after the collapse of Drysdale Government
Securities in 1982, and the 1987 share price crash.
After 22 years at First Chicago, one of the country's largest commercial
banks, Mr McDonough is new to central banking and has none of Mr Corrigan's
experience of quenching financial conflagrations. He at least inherits a
banking system which is in better shape than at any time since the Third
World debt crisis broke in 1982. The process of recuperation after the
credit binge of the late 1980s and the recession of the early 1990s has left
banks far stronger, he says. 'The health of the banking system is much
better than it was a number of years ago. Banks' balance sheets, and those
of their corporate and personal customers, have been returned to a much
greater degree of health.'
When pressed on what could pose the next big threat to the stability of the
US financial system, he had only one ready response: derivatives - the
financial instruments such as futures and options which have become the
dominant force in currency, interest rate and equity markets in the 1990s.
The instruments are 'an extremely important and useful tool for the
management of financial risk,' he says, but adds: 'Like all financial
instruments, they have their own risks, which must be managed and
controlled. We have to be careful, because they are very complicated
intellectually.'
As president of the New York Fed, Mr McDonough's pronouncements will be
second in importance only to those of Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of the
Federal Reserve Board and head of the central banking system. He will also
act as vice-chairman on the 12-person Federal Open Market Committee, which
guides monetary policy. Mr McDonough has already been responsible for 18
months for the day-to-day exercise of monetary policy, which is a job
delegated to the New York Fed. During that time, he has won the confidence
of economists on Wall Street.
Mr McDonough's generally sanguine view of US banks is matched by a
cautiously optimistic view of the nation's economy. Inflation, he says, is
likely to stabilise at around 3 per cent for the rest of this year, a level
which he thinks conducive to steady economic growth. The imprecision of the
data makes it likely that hints of renewed credit growth after the
contraction of recent years are likely to be premature, he warns. But he
points to the shrinkage in the indebtedness of the country's households and
companies as a sign of strength: 'It is creating a base on which sustained
and over time somewhat faster economic growth can be achieved.'
It is the faltering economies of Europe and Japan that pose the biggest
threat, he says. These economies are 'probably bottoming out,' but, 'an
economy can trip along the bottom for quite a period.'
In another contrast to his predecessor, Mr McDonough does not expect to take
a prominent role internationally, at least at first. Mr Corrigan was
well-known around the world, among other things through his leadership of
the Basle committee of international banking regulators and his efforts to
bolster the financial system of the former Soviet states. On Friday, as his
appointment emerged in an 11th-hour announcement, Mr McDonough predicted
that he would spend less time abroad than his predecessor - though he claims
his fluency in Spanish and near-fluency in French, as well as periods spent
abroad with First Chicago, mark him out as an internationalist at heart.
But, he adds, 'it is a job where that which is necessary to be done is not
predictable.'

<TEXT>
A McDonald's billboard in West Quincy, Illinois, submerged at the weekend
after the Mississippi River broke through a levee protecting the only
passable bridge along a 200-mile stretch of river from St Louis to
Burlington, Iowa. Volunteers had struggled day and night for six weeks to
maintain a sandbag barrier that was keeping open the Bayview Bridge to
Quincy. But on Friday night the barrier gave way, and rushing water covered
up to 14,000 acres including the entrance to the bridge. As rain again
drenched the region yesterday, rising waters drove more people from their
homes, swamped towns and severed road and rail links. The crest of the
floods reached St Louis and meteorologists said the weather patterns causing
heavy rain could continue for several weeks. The floods, among the
Mississippi's worst on record, have inundated hundreds of thousands of
acres, driven at least 30,000 people from their homes and created what
Vice-President Al Gore compared to a sixth Great Lake.

   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SOUTH Africa's constitutional negotiations resume today under the threat of
withdrawal by right-wing parties including the white-supremacist
Conservative party and the mainly Zulu Inkatha Freedom party.
Both the Conservative party and Inkatha have said they will boycott today's
talks, in a clear attempt to exert pressure on remaining negotiators, who
are now drawing up an interim constitution.
Both parties have said that their participation in the talks will be
conditional on the interim constitution: unless it provides for
self-determination for Afrikaners, CP leader Ferdi Hartzenberg has said his
party will permanently leave the talks. Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi of
Inkatha has threatened to launch a break-away constitutional convention
unless the draft constitution meets his demand for a federal state.
Such brinkmanship is probably inevitable, as constitutional negotiators
reach the crucial stage of considering the draft of a new constitution for
the next five years. The draft is being drawn up by a committee of legal
experts and will be submitted within weeks to the multi-party negotiating
forum. Today's talks are likely to be largely technical.
Inkatha walked out of the forum a fortnight ago, after a majority of parties
fixed April 27 next year as the date for South Africa's first multi-racial
elections. The Conservative party only made clear its decision to boycott
the talks last weekend. The two parties are the leading members of the
six-member Concerned South Africans Group. Some other members of the group
are likely to participate in today's talks.
Within the next few weeks, Inkatha will have to decide finally whether to
participate in the talks, in which Inkatha negotiators have already gained
major concessions from the government and the African National Congress.
They fear that Inkatha could launch a full-scale civil war in Natal
province, where political violence has claimed thousands of lives since
1984, unless it is accommodated at the talks. But negotiators from the ANC
and government have become increasing exasperated in recent days as Chief
Buthelezi has appeared to reject these concessions, and repeatedly
threatened to lead his own breakaway convention.
Inkatha negotiators say chances are good that their party will return to
talks eventually. But the Conservatives, who demand a race-based state where
non-whites would have inferior political rights, seem far more likely to
withdraw permanently. The other 25 parties to the talks all support a
multi-racial state with equal rights for all races, and are unlikely to
accommodate the CP.

FT  19 JUL 93 / EC and Russia in aluminium trade row
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TALKS in Moscow have failed to resolve the growing the rift between the
European Community and Russia over trade. The EC appears likely to restrict
aluminium imports from Russia and other former Soviet states.
Such a move would choke off a market which has produced a flow of
desperately needed hard currency.
The opening of the western European market to Russian goods has been
identified by Russian President Boris Yeltsin as a key objective - but one
which the Community has so far denied him.
Russia's key contention, underscored last week by Mr Gyorgy Gabunia, deputy
minister for foreign trade, is that 'we are no longer a command economy - we
are a market economy. We want to be treated by the Community as a market
economy - no better than others, but no worse.'
However, for Mr Hugo Parmen, the senior EC official in charge of
negotiations with the Russians, 'it is obvious they are still a state
trading country. They still have the remnants of a planned economy.'
Russia has said it wishes to become a member of the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade, which seeks to reduce or eliminate tariff barriers
between members. Mr Yeltsin has said he wants Russia to be a member by the
end of the year - an unrealistic demand of a body which takes at least two
years to process an application, but evidence of the Russian desire to get
in quickly. However, Russia has not yet submitted the memorandum necessary
to begin the application process.
Mr Gabunia says: 'We have one of the most open markets in the world - we
have tariffs on practically nothing.'
He instances particular restrictions against Russian goods - such as low
ceilings on imports of cars into Spain and Portugal, shoes into Spain, and
television sets and vodka into France. Mr Parmen agrees these restrictions
exist but says they are strictly disapproved of by the EC and 'will be
removed'.
The most crucial commodity is aluminium, though. According to EC figures,
aluminium exports from the Soviet Union to the EC were running in 1989 at
147,000 tonnes while in 1992, the former Soviet states exported to the
Community 529,000 tonnes (85 per cent of which came from Russia), an
increase of nearly 250 per cent. At the same time, the EC aluminium market
grew from 3.86m tonnes to 4.24m tonnes - an increase of only 14 per cent.
'The aluminium coming into the EC is being sold at very low prices,' said Mr
Parmen. 'The European producers cannot possibly compete with it.' He says
that the Community does not want to introduce ceilings, but will be forced
to do so if the exports are not cut.

FT  19 JUL 93 / Clinton to dismiss FBI chief accused of perks misuse
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR William Sessions' six-month battle to hold on to his job as director of
the US Federal Bureau of Investigation is expected to end this week with his
dismissal by President Bill Clinton.
Mr Sessions, under fire since a Justice Department investigation in January
accused him of misusing FBI perks and personnel, has so far refused to
resign, maintaining that all the charges against him are answerable.
But after a meeting on Saturday with Ms Janet Reno, the attorney-general, it
appeared that if Mr Sessions would not go gently, Mr Clinton was at last
prepared to dismiss him.
Mr Clinton on Friday met Mr Louis Freeh, a federal judge in Manhattan who is
viewed as the leading candidate to head the FBI. Mr Freeh is himself a
former FBI agent and federal prosecutor.
The wrangle over Mr Sessions' alleged ethical lapses has obscured a more
profound struggle within the FBI, and the new director will have a hard task
reasserting control over an agency which some critics say has disintegrated
into a number of feuding fiefdoms and has failed to grapple with some of the
US's most pressing crime problems.
One of Mr Sessions' demands has been that he should remain in office until
his successor is confirmed by the Senate, thus denying the chance to serve
as acting director to a deputy with whom he has been at loggerheads.
Some White House officials are sympathetic to Mr Sessions' denial of the
charges against him, which include personal use of government cars and
aircraft, and this may explain why Mr Clinton has been willing to wait so
long to allow him the chance for a more or less graceful exit.
Whatever the truth behind the ethical charges, it has become clear that Mr
Sessions' ability to serve as director has been considerably impaired.
Mr Sessions, originally appointed by former President Ronald Reagan, is half
way through a 10-year term of office, but can be dismissed by the president.

EUROPEAN Community foreign ministers will today consider trade sanctions
against Croatia to deter further Croatian and Serb aggression in Bosnia.
The move comes after weekend talks in Geneva aimed at persuading Bosnia's
Moslems to accept a UN-EC brokered plan to turn Bosnia into a confederation
of three republics.
Lord Owen, the EC mediator, will report to EC ministers on the chances of
winning an agreement.
He is also expected to repeat fears of a humanitarian disaster in Bosnia
this winter, unless a peace settlement is reached and more money raised for
emergency aid.
Pressure for sanctions against Croatia has grown within the Community amid
evidence of collusion between Serbia and Croatia in carving up Bosnia and
blocking UN relief convoys trying to reach besieged Moslems.
The UK is ready to raise the threat of sanctions against Croatia. However,
Germany has reservations.
Sanctions against Croatia would involve the withdrawal of existing trade
privileges rather than the wide-ranging UN embargo against Serbia which
ministers insist must be tightened.
One idea is for Mr Willy Claes, foreign minister of Belgium, to visit Zagreb
along with the EC 'troika' of past, present and future EC presidencies to
present a sanctions ultimatum to Croatia.
Today's foreign ministers' meeting in Brussels will also discuss new EC
rules to allow foreign EC nationals to vote in next year's European
Parliament elections in the country where they are resident, providing they
are registered in time.
Ministers will also discuss the final form of the six new rules for
disbursement of Ecu141.5bn (Pounds 107.1bn) of structural funds to poorer EC
regions over the next six years. This is expected to go through without
difficulty, but member states are still arguing over their final share of
the funds - a matter to be resolved in bilateral negotiations with the
European Commission.

FT  19 JUL 93 / Danes resolute in fending off attack on krone
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HILARY BARNES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   COPENHAGEN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE SIEGE of the Danish krone on foreign exchange markets has re-opened the
debate about whether the pressure on the currency can be put down to
'speculators' or something more seriously wrong in the Danish economy.
Mrs Marianne Jelved, the economy minister, is adamant it has nothing to do
with 'economic fundamentals' - and that there is no case for a devaluation,
let alone for leaving the European exchange rate mechanism.
As the krone enters its second week under attack, she is determined to see
the doubters and speculators beaten off for the fourth time in 12 months.
However, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, in its
half-yearly Economic Outlook published in June, warned that the Danish
government's expansive fiscal policy could well lead markets to doubt 'the
country's continued commitment to a hard currency policy'.
Mrs Jelved points to Denmark's low inflation rate - about 1 per cent over
the past 12 months - and a DKr28bn (Pounds 2.84bn) surplus on the balance of
payments of the current account, well over 3 per cent of gross domestic
product.
But, as the OECD reports, the central government budget deficit this year
and next will be about DKr55bn, 6 per cent of GDP, according to the
government's own forecasts. A deficit of half that is sought under the
Maastricht treaty on closer European union.
Then there is an unemployment rate of 12 per cent, which reflects the fact
that over the past six years the annual average GDP growth rate has been
just 1 per cent. In the first quarter of this year, GDP fell by 1.3 per cent
compared with the first quarter last year.
Export competitiveness has been hit by the depreciation of the British
pound, the Swedish krona and other currencies, leaving the trade-weighted
value of the krone up about 8 per cent.
First quarter exports fell in value by 8.6 per cent from the same quarter
last year and by about 6 per cent in volume.
Nonetheless, few leading export companies are actively urging a devaluation,
although their profits are being badly squeezed.
But it is 'a very sensitive issue', as Mr Knud Sorensen, chief executive of
the country's biggest bank, Den Danske Bank, said, even before the latest
attack on the krone.
The coalition government, headed by the Social Democratic leader Mr Poul
Nyrup Rasmussen, is determined to get the economy moving again. It has
embarked on an expansionist fiscal policy, in marked contrast to most other
European governments, which are searching for spending cuts in the interests
of lower interest rates.
The main thrust is in big cuts in income tax next year. Over five years, the
revenue loss will be made up through other tax increases, but in 1994 and
1995 the reform will be under-financed.
In addition, there is a programme to increase infrastructure investment.
The government says the boost to demand is a result of the changes will lead
to an increase in GDP of 3.4 per cent in 1994, with private consumption
soaring by 4.3 per cent.

FT  19 JUL 93 / Bosnia threatens to boycott talks: Izetbegovic demands end
to Serb advance on Sarajevo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
MR Alija Izetbegovic, the president of Bosnia, yesterday said he would
boycott peace talks in Geneva if Serb forces pressed forward with their
assault on Sarajevo.
Bosnian radio said Serb forces breached defence lines in three places on
Mount Igman, an important Moslem stronghold. Fighting was also reported in
Hadzici, just west of Sarajevo, where UN officials spotted 16 Serb tanks
last week.
The Serb advance is aimed at forcing Mr Izetbegovic to accept the republic's
ethnic partition, which he opposes as a legitimisation of 'ethnic
cleansing'.
However, in an apparent retreat on his position, Mr Izetbegovic - who faces
growing international pressure to reach a peace settlement - last night said
that Bosnia might have to be divided along ethnic lines to end the
bloodshed.
In an address carried by Bosnian radio, he said: 'We should not accept a
permanent division of Bosnia. But without great concessions in terms of
ethnic division, there is no way to get peace in the near future.
'Maybe we could solve this dilemma if we are ready to continue fighting
(against Serbs and Croats) for one more year. But if we want peace now,
concessions are inevitable.' A week ago Bosnia's collective presidency
drafted a peace plan calling for preserving Bosnia intact as a federal,
multi-ethnic state with equal rights for Serbs, Moslems and Croats.
Serbian and Croatian leaders, meeting in Geneva at the weekend, denied
attempts to carve up Bosnia between them and said their proposal for a loose
confederation of three ethnic mini-states was the only way to lasting peace.
President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia and President Franjo Tudjman of
Croatia, in a statement after talks with Lord Owen and Mr Thorvald
Stoltenberg, the international mediators for former Yugoslavia, said
speculation on a two-way division of Bosnia was 'unfounded'.
But Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic has given tomorrow as the deadline
for the Bosnian government to accept partition along ethnic lines. If not,
he told a Belgrade newspaper yesterday, the government faces 'total defeat'.
The presidents of Serbia and Croatia plan to return to Geneva tomorrow or on
Wednesday if the mediators succeed in convening a new round of talks on a
confederal peace plan for Bosnia involving all parties. The Bosnian Serbs
and Croats support the plan and some members of the collective Bosnian
presidency have said they would discuss it.
Mr Izetbegovic reiterated that peace talks could not take place while Serb
forces tightened their stranglehold on Bosnian government targets. 'We
cannot go there if offensive activities in Bosnia continue, especially
against Sarajevo,' he said after talks with Mr Vitaly Churkin, Russian
President Boris Yeltsin's peace envoy.
In an interview with a Belgrade newspaper, General Ratko Mladic, Bosnian
Serb commander, warned: 'It is up to Alija and those who advise him to think
what to do. I have left Sarajevo to the end.'

FT  19 JUL 93 / Tudjman hails bridge reopening as victory
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA SILBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CROATIAN President Franjo Tudjman yesterday formally re-opened the strategic
Maslenica bridge, which joins northern Croatia with its southern Dalmatian
coast, after a delay earlier in the day when Serb forces shelled the area.
Frustrated with Serbian opposition to the opening of the bridge and in spite
of warnings from United Nations officials that it could re-ignite the
Serbo-Croat conflict, Croatia went ahead and installed the temporary pontoon
structure.
Mr Tudjman called the opening a 'great victory for Croatian politics' and a
'big step' for Croatia in re-establishing control over its territory.
Speaking in front of the ruins of the old bridge, destroyed in the 1991 war,
Mr Tudjman called on the Serbs of Knin, the centre of the self-styled Serb
state of Krajina which cuts Croatia in half, to 'get rid of their
extremists' and work with Zagreb, the Croatian capital, on the reopening of
electricity, traffic, and transport lines.
The new bridge could help bolster Mr Tudjman's sagging popularity,
especially in Dalmatia. The inhabitants of Adriatic cities are hostage to
Serb rebels within artillery range from the hinterland and are forced to
lived with daily power cuts.

   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Giuseppe Garofano, the former senior executive of the troubled Ferruzzi
group, has admitted that Italy's second largest industrial empire was
illicitly funding the Christian Democrat party.
The revelation emerged after he had been interrogated by Milan magistrates
for more than 13 hours over the weekend.
The interrogations followed an exceptionally swift deal between Milan
magistrates and Swiss judicial authorities following Mr Garofano's arrest at
Geneva airport on Tuesday after being on the run for six months.
The return of Mr Garofano, who stepped down as chairman of Montedison,
Ferruzzi's chemicals group, in November 1992, promises to shed light on how
the Ferruzzi empire has managed to accumulate debts of L31,000bn (Pounds
13bn). The debts plus heavy losses forced a consortium of banks to step in
last month to salvage the group.
Among Mr Garofano's first admissions was that L250m had been paid to the
Christian Democrat party in Lombardy from Ferruzzi-Montedison funds. Last
September, when questioned by Milan magistrates, he had said this money had
come from his own sources. It was on the charge of having provided this sum
in illicit funding to the party that his arrest warrant was issued.
Milan magistrates believe the L250m represented only a small part of wider
illicit funding. For more than six months the magistrates have been
examining the dealings behind the reorganisation of the chemicals industry
and Montedison's sale of its 40 per cent stake in Enimont to ENI, the state
oil concern. Mr Garofano is understood to know about this transaction, as
well as others involving Enimont minority shareholders.
Mr Garofano is due to be questioned again tomorrow.

Mr Cagliari has been in jail since March 4 on charges of illicit financing

A Paris tribunal on Saturday rejected a complaint by the CGT, the French

The dispute arose after the government refused to renew a one-year

Virgin is appealing against the decision.

FT  19 JUL 93 / The undoing of EFIM: Crisis-hardened bankers tested by Efim
hurdles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BANKERS in Italy have this decade grown accustomed to an annual crisis.
First came the collapse of the Federconsorzi farm services group in 1991,
then the liquidation of Efim last year. This year has brought new troubles
with the rescue of Ferruzzi, Italy's second-biggest private company.
The involvement of the same big banks at the top of the creditors' list
means the need to find fast, transparent solutions has become crucial to
prevent embarrassing loan write-offs and lower profits.
Efim has proved easily the most complicated and, so far, frustrating of the
three crises for bankers. Even by Italian standards, progress has been
painfully slow, information uncommonly inadequate and the number of
conflicting interests unusually complicated.
'I'm just about to write the fifth, sixth or seventh letter to the prime
minister calling for urgent action,' says Mr Guido Rosa, chairman of the
Foreign Banks' Association in Italy and head of the local unit of France's
Societe Generale.
Mr Rosa, a veteran of Federconsorzi and now tied up in the Ferruzzi saga,
has lost count of the letters he has sent on behalf of foreign bankers.
Foreign banks account for about L3,500bn (Pounds 1.47bn) of Efim's L8,800bn
exposure to financial institutions.
'The problem is communication,' he says.
The bankers' first gripe is with Mr Alberto Predieri, one of Italy's most
experienced liquidation lawyers and the special administrator put in to run
Efim last year. Complaints range from allegedly excessive absences from the
office to disapproval of his methods; 'eccentric' is one of the more polite
words used.
The European Commission runs Mr Predieri a close second. Its decision to
block plans to repay creditor banks, on the grounds that the Italian
government's proposal represents unfair state aid, places Brussels high in
bankers' unpopularity stakes.
Bankers have also been enraged by a second strand in the Commission's
argument; that they should have first asked themselves whether Efim was the
recipient of illegal state aid before agreeing to lend it money. As some
point out, opining on the legality of state funding is something the
Commission should have done years ago, not the banks.
Italian Treasury officials are not free of criticism. Although relations
between bank creditors - particularly foreign banks - and the Treasury have
improved since confrontations last September, the climate remains unsettled.
A three-hour meeting this month of about 120 bank creditors in London
rekindled the idea of ostracising Italian borrowers in the international
financial markets if matters are not settled soon.
It takes little provocation for bankers to recall the extraordinary
confusion - virtually unprecedented for an advanced industrial country  -
last August and September when the Treasury issued three decrees within
weeks, all of which left open more questions than they answered.
The first decree was the biggest bombshell: it implied creditors would only
receive 80 per cent of the face value of their loans. Once over the shock,
banks attacked the proposal as a 'unilateral rescheduling', unimaginable
from a member of the Group of Seven industrialised countries.
The Treasury could not have chosen a worse moment to antagonise the
financial community, given the storm that was about to break in the foreign
exchange markets. The decree provoked a stream of adverse publicity - some
papers compared Italy to a banana republic - just when the authorities most
needed the support and confidence of financial markets to keep the lira
stable.
Although the government eventually climbed down and agreed to honour all the
debts owed by Efim and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, differences were only
partly resolved.
The next decree antagonised bankers further by setting the interest rates on
the special bonds to cover Efim's borrowings at about half corresponding
market rates.
The decision renewed threats to blackball Italian borrowers. It also
signalled a tense period in which bankers considered using a legal
technicality to put into default loans by some Italian state-owned groups
being transformed into joint stock companies.
Relations between the government and the banks have thawed since, partly
because of a greater willingness by Treasury officials to meet the banks.
However, many foreign bankers are bitter over what they view as
unprofessional conduct by the authorities. The severest criticism is
levelled against the lack of detail about Treasury plans to repay lenders
and delays in supplying information.
One foreign banker says some, who 'knew Italy and understood the mentality',
tried to explain it was unreasonable to expect anything better. 'We
recommended patience, as these things tend to sort themselves out in Italy
in the end. But try explaining that to a Japanese or US bank which has no
first-hand knowledge of Italian business.'
The ill will explains why, even today, some bankers believe Rome is using
the European Commission's opposition to repayment as an excuse to avoid
compensating creditors. Mr Rosa thinks such a view is far-fetched, as the
Treasury has already allocated funds for repayment and the total bill is
mounting as accrued interest builds up. But some bankers are sceptical.
'The Treasury promised that repayments would start by the end of April. Then
the Commission stepped in and everything came to a standstill. Now Treasury
officials say matters are outside their control, while the situation in
Brussels is confusing at best,' says the head of one European bank in Milan.
Once the Commission's block is lifted, bank creditors will still have a
string of grumbles. Foremost is that repayment should be extended to Efim
subsidiaries which are less than 100 per cent owned by the parent company.
The list includes important operations such as the Breda Costruzioni
Ferroviarie railway equipment unit.
Bankers are also confused about how they will be repaid. Originally, the
Treasury announced plans to issue special bonds, denominated in either lire
or Ecus. This year, however, the Treasury's borrowing arm was cleared to
embark on an international borrowing programme to raise funds to pay back
creditors - implying that repayment would come in cash.
'It's totally unclear. No one understands anything about this,' says Mr
Rosa.
Mr Predieri also has a bone to pick with some of Efim's bankers. Some have
decided unilaterally to terminate swap deals - which are complicated
financial transactions based on arbitraging interest rates or currencies -
for Efim and its subsidiaries.
The swaps, linked to foreign currency loans by the group, were terminated
before their official maturity on the grounds of Efim's financial crisis.
However, aborting the deals has raised the group's debts yet further in lira
terms because of the currency's devaluation since the swaps were signed.
The banks are likely to be repaid eventually and some lessons are likely to
be learnt along the way. But many bankers may by then be worrying about the
next Italian crisis.

FT  19 JUL 93 / The undoing of EFIM: Rome plots survival course for defence
industry - Finmeccanica is the key rescue vehicle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ITALY'S defence industry is being slimmed down and reorganised as a result
of Efim's liquidation, leaving the state with a strong centrally-controlled
stake in the business.
Closure or sale to foreign buyers of Efim's seven defence companies would
mean a drastic cut in Italy's indigenous armaments and aerospace production
capacity. Efim's Oto Melara, Breda Meccanica, Officina Galileo and SMA,
together with the three companies in the Agusta group, produce items ranging
from missiles, naval artillery, light armaments and armoured vehicles to
helicopters, jet trainers and radar appliances.
The combined annual turnover of L2,100bn (Pounds 889m) is equivalent to
almost half the nation's current annual defence procurement budget.
Equally, with Efim's defence companies accounting for a third of the
holding's workforce and nearly 20 per cent of accumulated losses, the hiving
off of this activity has been an essential step in the liquidation process.
From the outset the previous government of Prof Giuliano Amato decided to
ensure the survival of Efim's defence interests. The current administration
of Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi has not altered this policy.
The path chosen has been to merge these defence interests with Finmeccanica,
the high-technology and main industrial arm of IRI, the principal state
holding company. Synergy exists, as Finmeccanica has extensive defence
interests centred on aerospace through its Alenia subsidiary, whose
programmes include the new European fighter aircraft. But against a
background of declining defence procurement at home and abroad - plus the
need to balance its own books and prepare for an approach to the stock
market to raise capital - Finmeccanica remains a wary partner.
The group stipulated it could only assume Efim's defence portfolio if there
was no financial charge, jobs were shed and plants rationalised, and the
government announced a defence procurement programme which guaranteed orders
that in turn provided insurance for production lines to survive.
In January a temporary solution was agreed: to lease the companies to
Finmeccanica for six months, giving management but not financial
responsibility.
Last Wednesday, two weeks behind schedule, the government forced
Finmeccanica's hand, in effect decreeing the takeover. Government and
Finmeccanica must now bargain over the company's demand that a minimum of
L10,100bn is available over the next decade in procurement orders for these
companies, and that 1,900 jobs are cut from the workforce of 11,729.
On this basis the Efim companies could begin to show a profit by 1995.
However, big job losses, especially where accompanied by plant closures,
will be contested by the unions, which have already won considerable
concessions in the case of the restructuring of Finmeccanica's Alenia.
The key will be the future of Agusta, which has good helicopter technology
in the EH101 venture with Westland of the UK but which lacks orders. It has
also been poorly managed and its financial position is extremely weak,
having lost L1,674bn between 1987 and 1991 and recorded a further L858bn
loss last year - almost one lira for every lira received in sales.
Agusta has made the mistake of accumulating excessive stocks that totalled
L1,600bn at the time of Efim's liquidation.
It will get about L400bn of the L1,068bn earmarked by the liquidators for
the defence side of Efim. But this will be insufficient, and the company
cannot afford to be in a weak financial position at a time of fierce
international competition in the helicopter sector.
Hanging on the fate of Efim's defence interests are also a mass of private
contractors who are the most vulnerable creditors.

FT  19 JUL 93 / The undoing of EFIM: Disposal may signal revival of fortunes
for large glassmaker
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
PILKINGTON, the UK glass group, and Techint, the Italian-Argentine
industrial concern, are this week expected to sign a contract to buy Siv,
Italy's lossmaking glass producer. The deal marks the first big disposal in
the year-long liquidation of Efim, formerly Italy's third-biggest state
holding company.
Pilkington and Techint, advised by Schroders, the UK merchant bank, are
paying L210bn (Pounds 88.9m) for Siv, which lost L61bn before tax last year.
The price represents a substantial discount on the company's net asset value
of about L300bn. However, the purchasers are taking on L250bn in debt.
Buying joint control of Siv will boost Pilkington's geographic and product
range and narrow the gap with France's Saint Gobain, Europe's market leader
in glass.
The Italian company is the biggest European producer of car glass, where
Pilkington is relatively weak. The acquisition will also raise Pilkington's
profile in Italy and Spain. Siv has two float glass lines and two car glass
plants in Italy, and a third car glass operation in Spain. The company,
which had sales of L670bn last year, has about 4,000 employees.
Its earnings have been hit by chronic overstaffing and the downturn in the
European automotive sector. Talks on the sale were complicated by the need
for agreement on redundancies at Siv plants, concentrated in the
high-unemployment area of southern Abruzzo.
The deal involves 450 job losses, fewer than half those originally sought,
according to Italian press reports. However, further job cuts are virtually
certain over the long term.
The purchasers are expected to invest about L100bn in the next three years.
Pilkington joined forces with Techint, which specialises in steel and which
has plants in Italy and Latin America, to improve its chances in the bidding
process. In the end, however, the two partners were the only bidders.
Techint is cash-rich and has already participated in a number of Latin
American privatisations. It, too, has been keen to raise its Italian
exposure.
Combined ownership may provide the boost needed to turn Siv around. While
Pilkington has great expertise in glassmaking, it has little management
experience in Italy. Techint is a stranger to glass, but has considerable
management knowhow in the complex Italian market.

FT  19 JUL 93 / The undoing of EFIM: Liquidation exposes Italian economic
fault lines - The government's ability to handle its ambitious privatisation
programme will be put to the test
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE FAULTS and weaknesses of the Italian economic system have been exposed
by the liquidation of Efim, the state industrial holding, which will cost
taxpayers at least L17,000bn (Pounds 7.2bn).
A year after a hurried decision was taken by the then government of Prof
Giuliano Amato to place the chronic lossmaker in voluntary liquidation, Efim
is still very much alive - rather than half dead as it should be by now.
The first asset disposal of the holding's 120 companies is due to be
concluded this week with the L210bn sale of Siv, the glassmaker. But the
liquidation process is unlikely to meet the ambitious two-year deadline of
July 1994.
This is not surprising since Efim, with L18,000bn in outstanding debt and
the livelihood of 37,000 employees at stake, constitutes the biggest
voluntary liquidation in post-war Europe. Efim's odd assortment of
activities range from aluminium smelting, armaments and helicopters to
manufacturing mass transit systems, owning health spas and construction.
The sheer size and diversity of the group has complicated the operation. But
despite the difficulties, the Italian authorities need to complete the
liquidation successfully to offer convincing proof of efficient
administration and a genuine desire to curb the dominant role of the state.
Failure to do so will reflect on their ability to handle smoothly the
ambitious privatisation programme, as many of the problems encountered are
similar.
Among the more significant factors that have slowed and complicated Efim's
liquidation are: A crowded government agenda: the Amato government and its
successor, headed by Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, have had their hands full
first with a currency crisis, and then tackling the public sector deficit
against a background of collapsing traditional parties.
Nationwide corruption scandals: five Efim companies are implicated in
kickback investigations, the most serious being Agusta, the lossmaking
helicopter group, and Efim's finance subsidiary, Nuova Safim.
Bureaucracy: three ministries have been involved (Treasury, Industry, and
State Shareholdings), paperwork has been complex and liquidators have been
hampered by the government as shareholder dictating policy via inflexible
decrees, only alterable by fresh decrees. There have been four.
Recession: the sharp decline in industrial activity, especially in defence,
has caused constant adjustments in the liquidation plans, while rising
unemployment has increased the social pressure to curb the level of job
losses. Up to 40 per cent of Efim's workforce is regarded as surplus.
Inexperience: liquidation has been an infrequent instrument, and Italy lacks
both the juridical tools and the technical expertise.
An additional factor has been the comportment of Mr Alberto Predieri, the
72-year-old liquidator and a leading bankruptcy lawyer and former Olivetti
board member. To the dismay of creditors, he has retained his consultancy in
Florence, been difficult to contact and delegated extensively.
As a result, those affected by the Efim liquidation are exasperated and
angry. 'The liquidation of Efim is the greatest fraud ever perpetrated by a
government in Europe,' says Mr Giustino Bello, who acts as co-ordinator for
400 small and medium-sized Italian and foreign creditor companies owed more
than L400bn.
'We are dealing with a state holding which a year after being put into
liquidation has not paid a single small creditor, at least 30 of whom risk
going under as a result,' he claims.
The supplier creditors, owed L4,000bn, should have begun to be paid in early
April. Last week the Ciampi government promised 30 per cent would be paid
'rapidly'. The small suppliers, lacking in muscle, remain sceptical and have
initiated in Turin a court action to impugn the Efim liquidation decree,
converted into law on February 17, as unconstitutional. They have also
suggested that they be paid in the form of tax credits, discounts on VAT and
relief on social security payments.
The banks, owed L8,800bn, are in no better a position. The Amato government
badly damaged Italy's international credibility by failing to consult
foreign or local banks in advance of the liquidation and by seeking to
impose a two-year moratorium on what the banks assumed to be sovereign debt
lodged with Efim and its subsidiaries. 'The handling of this was the
greatest error of my government,' Prof Amato freely admits.
After a series of acrimonious encounters, the foreign bank creditors owed
L3,500bn have obtained satisfaction on the terms of payment. But they have
received no money because of the controlling veto of Brussels.
The closure, rationalisation and sale of the holding's companies was
initially thought likely to cost L10,000bn-L12,000bn. However, the burden
will be much greater, with interest charges at 13 per cent, the need for
fresh capital to sustain viable company operations and the cost of shedding
labour and almost certainly maintaining some companies beyond the programmed
two-year liquidation timetable.
The Ciampi government is being obliged to allow some L4,000bn in 1994,
according to those familiar with the liquidation process. They also say if
all debts are to be honoured the ultimate cost could exceed L17,000bn, a
figure that includes the offsetting income from asset sales.
Given that so much public money is involved, remarkably few questions have
been asked about how the group was allowed to get itself into such a mess.
The simple answer may be that Efim had been long regarded as a dustbin into
which lossmaking industries were tipped and kept alive to promote political
patronage with lavish use of state funds.
Efim was an emblem of the politico-economic system that embedded itself in
Italy from the 1950s. Created in 1962 as an industrial hospital aimed
primarily to sustain companies committed to expanding in the Mezzogiorno,
Efim was loosely managed and politically manipulated from the outset.
As part of a political deal, Efim was allowed to be a Socialist fief, while
IRI, the larger public holding, was in the hands of the Christian Democrats.
Thus at the time of liquidation Mr Gaetano Mancini, cousin of the most
powerful Socialist politician in the south, was chairman and his deputy was
Mr Mauro Leone, a Christian Democrat and son of a former president of the
Republic. Mr Leone was arrested in March on charges of fraud in connection
with the running of Nuova Safim.
Breaking the political hold on Efim and reshaping the entire role of the
public sector in the economy was Prof Amato's prime objective in liquidating
the holding. Indeed, as a Socialist linked to the then leader, Mr Bettino
Craxi, he saw getting rid of Efim as a demonstration of his own impartiality
and concrete proof that the state was set to reduce its interventionist role
in industry and would no longer underwrite lossmaking businesses.
Throughout the 1980s Efim's finances deteriorated, weighed down by losses in
the aluminium industry (Alumix accounted for almost half the 1991 loss of
L1,176bn) and the increasing crisis in the defence industry. But all the
businesses were sustained by an unquestioning belief from suppliers,
creditors and managers that the state was behind Efim.
'We thought it was gilt-edged dealing with Agusta: it was military
helicopters, Euro-defence and state-owned,' observed one disillusioned
British supplier.
When it was placed in liquidation Efim was losing L37 for every L100 of
turnover, and of the 120 companies only 33 were in profit. Mr Predieri
commented recently: 'All the others were running at a loss, many for years,
despite attempts to massage their balance sheets to obscure losses.'
As liquidator Mr Predieri has had to follow awkward twin paths of trying to
satisfy creditors and guarantee the survival of those companies considered
viable. Efim has some good assets like Efim Ferroviarie, the mass transit
manufacturer. But the danger throughout has been to avoid the state being
saddled with a rump of lossmakers that are seen as necessary to maintain,
either because of their regional importance (like aluminium smelting in
Sardinia) or because of their 'strategic' nature, as with the seven defence
companies.
This danger, plus job losses, will be the main issue in the coming months -
provided creditors start getting paid soon and the dispute with the EC is
resolved.

FT  19 JUL 93 / Japan faces coalition rule: Liberal Democrats lose overall
majority as reformist parties make gains
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
JAPAN'S Liberal Democratic party yesterday lost its overall parliamentary
majority after almost 40 years in government, ushering in a period of
political instability without precedent since the second world war.
The LDP will seek to keep a hold on power in a coalition, probably with one
of the new conservative parties which made impressive gains at the expense
of the socialist opposition in yesterday's snap general election.
Party leaders will start bargaining today over the shape of a coalition
government, the core of which could be formed either by the LDP or an
alliance of opposition parties.
Tokyo's stock and foreign exchange markets reacted cautiously to the result.
Early today the 225-share Nikkei average was down 205.62 in the first hour
of trading at 20,125.91. The yen opened at Dollars 107.9, marginally up on
its Friday close of Dollars 107.98.
Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, was last night under pressure from
within his own party to resign to take responsibility for the setback and
clear the way for talks on a coalition.
The uncertainty of coalition government will be a sharp contrast to the
stability which has been the hallmark of the LDP's rule since it was formed
by a merger of two conservative parties in 1955.
The party, working closely with the Japanese business community and powerful
bureaucracy, has taken Japan from hunger and homelessness after the war to
become one of the world's richest economies.
The LDP stayed in power by keeping pace with the social changes unleashed by
Japan's economic growth, transforming itself into a modernising catch-all
party of the right. The election suggests the mantle of modernisation has
passed into new hands.
Although the LDP emerged from the elections as overwhelmingly the largest
party in the 511-member lower house of the Diet (parliament), the balance of
power will be held by recently formed reformist conservative parties: the
Japan New party, launched a year ago, its ally the New Harbinger party, and
the Japan Renewal party, formed by the 36 lower house LDP members who broke
away from the ruling party a month ago.
The Japan Renewal party, led by Mr Tsutomu Hata, a former finance minister,
did better than expected, winning 55 seats. The Japan New party won 35 seats
in its first general election. The NHP, which is expected to merge with the
Japan New party, won 13 seats.
The LDP, in an impressive display of its electoral durability based on the
strength of its local organisation, won 223 seats, broadly maintaining its
strength after last month's split in spite of the prolonged recession and
recurring political scandals. When the last parliament was dissolved, the
LDP had 227 MPs.
The main loser was the Social Democratic party, the former Socialists, which
prompted the election by lodging a no-confidence motion on June 18.
The SDP lost 64 of its 134 seats, mainly in urban areas where independent
voters turned to the new parties. Mr Akira Yamagishi, president of Rengo,
Japan's largest trade union organisation, confirmed that the SDP's demise
may be terminal. 'The SDP will have little impact on Japanese politics in
the future,' he said.
Komeito, the Clean Government party, increased its standing by six seats to
51, while the other centrist parties maintained or marginally increased
their representation. The turnout was a record low of 67.2 per cent,
suggesting that many Japanese abstained, the traditional method of voicing
dissatisfaction with the LDP, rather than turn to the new parties.
Mr Gaishi Hiraiwa, the chairman of the Keidanren, the employers' federation,
called for the formation of a stable LDP coalition, while other business
leaders welcomed the rise of the new conservative groups to provide a
political alternative.
The LDP's main rival for the JNP's hand will be Mr Hata's Renewal Party. An
agreement between the two reformist parties could provide the basis for a
wider agreement among the opposition camp to oust the LDP and introduce
sweeping reforms to the country's corruption riddled political system.
Mr Hata urged the new parties to discuss a parliamentary pact on the basis
of their underlying agreement on policies.

FT  19 JUL 93 / Private investors granted fewer BT shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRIVATE investors in the UK have been allocated fewer BritishTelecom shares
than in the government's previous sale after strong demand from
institutional investors, particularly in North America.
Institutional investors have been allocated 40 per cent of the Pounds 5bn
BT3 offer - compared with 33 per cent in 1991 - after bidding for 2.9bn
shares, with 1.2bn on offer.
The price of the international offer was set yesterday at 420p, 12p above
BT's closing price on Friday of 408p. The 12p above the market price is
considered to be the time value associated with paying in three instalments.
A UK Treasury official said it was the first time the government had sold
shares in a company at its effective market price.
The UK public offer - which is set at a 10p discount to the international
offer price - was allocated 60 per cent of the available shares. Individual
shareholders applied for only 1bn shares compared with 1.7bn in 1991.
More than 95 per cent of applicants in the UK public offer will receive an
allocation and more than half will get all they applied for. However, non-BT
shareholders who applied for more than 700 shares through the Share
Information Office or more than 1,500 through a share shop will not receive
anything.
UK institutions accounted for just 46 per cent of bids in the international
offer. They have been allocated an extra 2 per cent, partly because they are
thought less likely to sell their shares in the aftermarket than overseas
investors. North America accounted for 27 per cent of the international

FT  19 JUL 93 / Major steps up pressure over treaty vote
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR yesterday refused to countenance defeat in this week's crucial
House of Commons vote on the Maastricht treaty's social chapter as he
stepped up pressure on Conservative Euro-sceptics to fall into line.
Entering the most difficult week of his premiership, the prime minister
repeatedly expressed incredulity that any Tory MP would vote for proposals
that he said would raise unemployment and transfer 'massive' powers from the
UK to Brussels. 'I don't believe - given the nature of the social chapter -
that Conservative MPs, when they consider what it means and what it can do,
are going to do other than support the government,' Mr Major said.
Interviewed on BBC TV's On The Record, the prime minister was adamant that
Thursday's vote was not about ratifying the treaty or his own political
future. 'Here is a free-standing debate on the social chapter,' he said,
four times sidestepping the suggestion it would amount to a vote of
confidence in him.
But some Euro-sceptics immediately rejected this position and called for the
government to make it clear whether it intended to ratify Maastricht with
Britain's social chapter opt-out intact irrespective of the outcome of
Thursday's vote.
'At the present time we have to vote on hypotheticals because we do not know
if by voting for the social chapter we destroy the treaty or not,' said one
hard-core Euro-sceptic.
'This is not at all about the social chapter - it is about whether or not
the treaty proceeds,' said another Euro-sceptic.
As senior ministers said privately it was 'inconceivable' the government
would not ratify Maastricht, the prime minister dismissed as 'not remotely
likely' suggestions his current problems might trigger a leadership
challenge. He admitted recent moves to seek a judicial review of Maastricht
in the High Court might 'inhibit' ratification.
Some Euro-sceptics were yesterday confident there are enough Tory rebels to
defeat the government if none of the opposition parties break ranks.
The government is expected to wait until Wednesday before deciding whether
to increase efforts to persuade the Ulster Unionists to vote with the
government, perhaps by hinting that their longstanding demand for a Northern
Ireland select committee will be granted.
One Unionist said yesterday the party's nine MPs planned to decide how they
would vote at a meeting on Thursday morning.
Meanwhile, Mr John Smith yesterday raised expectations Labour would press
for a vote of censure if the government lost Thursday's vote and ignored the
verdict. 'If he (Mr Major) behaves outrageously and defies the will of
parliament that is a matter we must take extremely seriously,' the Labour
leader said.
His remarks came as an NOP poll for the Trades Union Congress found 44 per
cent of respondents thought the social chapter should apply to Britain as
well as other European countries, with 10 per cent neutral and 15 per cent
answering Don't Know.

FT  19 JUL 93 / Doubts over effectiveness of Japan-style work practices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PENT-UP resentment from British workers over the imposition of
Japanese-style working practices could have a 'devastating effect' on
industry as the recovery continues, according to a report commissioned by
the government and due to be published tomorrow.
The review of the influence of Japanese companies on UK labour practices
finds 'little evidence that Japanese-style international competitiveness can
be achieved in Britain by copying some, or even most, Japanese working
methods'. It also raises questions about the effect of having to 'work as
hard as humanly possible' on the quality of employees' lives.
The study, conducted for the Department of Employment by Industrial
Relations Services, an independent pay and conditions research group, says
British manufacturers are using the threat of Japanese competition to push
through reforms in working practices. The report's author, Ms Sue Milsome,
says this tack has proved more persuasive than the more accurate 'but less
compelling' argument that 'competitive pressures demand changes in working
and management practices'. Labour law reforms and the recession have
probably had more influence on working methods in Britain than the example
of companies like Nissan, she says.
The report warns that the introduction of some working methods favoured by
Japanese companies could increase British industry's vulnerability. For
example, 'just-in-time' production means companies do not keep buffer
stocks. A sudden stoppage by workers could mean immediate lay-offs in other
plants, as happened during the 1988 Ford strike, the report also says.
It warns: 'At some point . . . the British economy will recover. If there is
a great deal of pent-up resentment against Japanese-style working practices,
and the fragility of production systems has been increased . . . worker
dissatisfaction leading to industrial action could have a devastating
effect.'
The study also points to the current debate in Japan over karoshi - death
through overwork. Karoshi, it says, is mainly as a result of the large
amounts of unpaid overtime performed by Japanese workers.
It concludes that the Japanese economic miracle, which has so impressed
western observers, is probably coming to an end. 'It may be that Japan's
employment practices, in particular, will be jettisoned as Japan becomes a
mature economy, so British employers should be wary of imitating practices
that are only appropriate in a climate of ever-increasing growth.'

FT  19 JUL 93 / Risk and Reward: How money purchase schemes could be made
more attractive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In a classic final salary-defined benefit scheme, the employer underwrites
the investment risk. But in a money purchase scheme, where the value of the
final benefit depends on how markets behave, the individual bears the risk.
However, if there were a technique to limit the risks the individual has to
bear, might money purchase schemes appear more attractive? Most techniques
on the market involve the gradual shift out of high-yielding but risky
equities into lower risk, lower yielding fixed-interest investments as an
individual approaches retirement.
But investment managers, sensing the commercial opportunities to be
exploited, have been hard at work looking for ways to offer money purchase
schemes with the rewards of equity investment combined with some guarantee
of the final level of benefit to be delivered.
Mercury Asset Management says it has found a way to address the problem
with a new product designed for group money purchase schemes with a
minimum of Pounds 500,000 to invest. MAM concedes that its guarantee
is incapable of ensuring that individuals will earn a benefit which
bears any relationship to salary.  After all, even if a lump sum could
be guaranteed, individuals will remain dependent on the vagaries of the
annuities market for the kind of benefit stream they can purchase with
their lump sum.
But what it will do, the firm says, is to offer some guarantees against
stock market collapse. The guarantee consists of a promise that individuals
will earn at least 90 per cent of the average daily market value of the
units in the pool in each year they participate. When they retire, they
surrender their units at the full value on that day. The guarantee means
that if equity prices tumble one year, individuals do not have to surrender
the gains they made in prior years.
Consulting actuaries who help companies choose pension fund investment
managers are studying the product closely. Mr Martin Kemp, associate partner
with consulting actuaries Bacon and Woodrow, said it bears some similarity
to a product launched by several insurance companies in the 1970s but
abandoned. 'We are looking at it to see if the guarantee offered is worth
the price,' Mr Kemp said.
Mr Graham Dixon of MAM, who designed the product, said the reason it
is now workable and affordable has to do with the advent of a sophisticated
market in over-the-counter derivatives.
Individuals who select the guarantee fund purchase units in a pool. For
every Pounds 100 invested, Pounds 99 goes into the pool while Pounds 1 will
go into a special reserve fund. MAM has left itself an 'out' clause by
retaining the ability both to raise the 0.9 per cent management fee charged
on the pool and to increase the proportion of pension contribution which
goes into the reserve.
What makes the product interesting is the way the reserve pool is invested.
As pension contributions are made, managers need to calculate the
liabilities - the benefits of those set to retire - for the next five years.
Roughly 10 per cent of the reserve pool will be used to buy over-the-counter
put options on the FTSE which are 10 per cent 'out of the money'. There is
an element of risk because the guarantee the investor receives is against
the broader market rather than against the top 100 stocks.
Mr Dixon concedes that the reserve fund could be vulnerable if the entire
market fell precipitously but the top 100 stocks outperformed the broad
market. However, in pre-market research going back to 1919 this situation
never arose.
Another 80 per cent will be invested in the equity pool itself, so the
returns to the reserve will mimic the sums it is guaranteeing. A further 10
per cent will be used to purchase options to cover the 'out of the money'
portion of the initial put options.
Mr Dixon calculates that the cost to MAM of providing the protection is
roughly 3 per cent to 4 per cent of the total invested, although he is more
vague about the cost to the individual.
The cost will reflect, to some extent, the amount of income effectively
surrendered by agreeing to accept only 90 per cent of the average market
value of equities in any given year.

FT  19 JUL 93 / Zurich tries new fix for drugs problem: Swiss initiative
legalises the use of heroin
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ZURICH has never been known as a centre for bargains, but starting next year
a few selected heroin addicts will be able to get their fixes in the city
legally for only about SFr3 (Dollars 1.90) a time.
The offer is part of the city government's latest initiative, unveiled this
week, for dealing with its outsize and persistent drug problem.
The initiative is itself part of a three-year national study involving 700
addicts to provide evidence on the pros and cons of legalising hard drugs.
Switzerland has an astonishingly high rate of hard drug addiction, with an
estimated 30,000 addicts, nearly 1/2 per cent of the 6.8m population. The
phenomenon is generally attributed to disaffection from a stiflingly orderly
society and to the country's very high level of affluence.
Zurich has long been the magnet for the country's addicts, notably because
the city's socialist-green coalition government has favoured a liberal drug
policy. It has stopped the police making arrests for minor offences and
provided shelter and rehabilitation programmes for those in need. Since
1988, it has offered free needles to all to prevent the spread of Aids.
By the late 1980s, about 1,000 people were regularly congregating in
Platzspitz, the once beautiful park behind the main railway station
transformed into a ghastly scene of decline and death.
Platzspitz, or Needle Park, as it was sometimes called, also became a huge
drug dealing centre, attracting mob dealers and hundreds of cash-and-carry
customers from Zurich's rich suburbs. And, as the park was very close to the
downtown business and shopping area, muggings, robberies and petty crime in
the area soared.
The city's business community protested, eventually winning the council's
commitment to close the park early last year.
City leaders then implemented a dispersal policy, sending non-Zurich
residents back home and billeting local addicts in small hostels. But within
days, the drug scene was reforming in an adjacent run-down neighbourhood,
and efforts by the police to break it up were about as effective as trying
to scare off pigeons from London's Trafalgar Square.
In the past few months, the scene has gradually moved to an abandoned
railway station a few hundred metres from Platzspitz. Last month, police
staged a surprise inspection and discovered that the congregation there was
much the same as it used to be at Platzspitz.
Of the 931 people checked, only 178 were city residents. Most of the dealers
were former Yugoslavs, many of them asylum seekers who, under Swiss law,
cannot be expelled until their applications have been processed.
'Things have got worse,' Mr Andres Oehler, the town council's spokesman on
drug matters, admits. 'The closing of Platzspitz has not had the hoped-for
effect.'
Mr Oehler says fresh attempts will now be made to disperse the non-resident
addicts, and most of the residents will become involved in the planned new
legal drug distribution programmes.
The city itself will set up a new treatment centre where it will supply 50
addicts with not only heroin injections and cocaine impregnated cigarettes,
but also with counselling. A private charity will do the same for another
150 female addicts, most of whom earn their drug money from prostitution.
Mrs Emilie Lieberherr, head of the city's social services department, said
the aim of the programme was to help the addicts survive, stabilise their
physical and mental health and, ultimately, to get them off drugs.
Unfortunately, it will not help answer two key questions associated with
hard drug liberalisation  - whether more people would be attracted to drugs
and whether the criminal problems associated with it would abate.
Mrs Lieberherr admitted that the programme was only 'a drop in the ocean' in
trying to solve Zurich's drug problem. But for the moment, it is all the
conservative leaders of the federal government will allow.
Meanwhile, the city has finally completed cleaning up Platzspitz at a cost
of SFr1.6m, much of it spent on sifting painstakingly through the earth in
search of used needles that would be deadly for a crawling baby.
The park, which now has high grille fencing all around it, is open only from
11am to 2pm on Tuesdays and Thursdays. Drug addicts are not welcome.

<TEXT>
ISRAEL yesterday issued a clear and public warning it would strike against
Arab guerrillas in southern Lebanon in retaliation for recent attacks which
killed five Israeli soldiers.
'The Israel Defence Forces is ready with reinforced troops to defend the
towns and residents of the north. It will act against those who hit its
forces in the security zone,' Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the prime minister, said.
After a long cabinet discussion Mr Rabin also admitted that Israel had
heavily reinforced the large area it controls inside Lebanon in the past
week.
Reports have suggested Israel has sent up to 1,000 troops  - including a
mechanised company  - and 22 pieces of large artillery to bolster its
existing force of 1,000 men and a 3,000-strong Israeli financed Lebanese
militia in the zone.
Israeli airforce planes flew across the Lebanese capital Beirut yesterday
and staged mock raids over the south. The fresh Israeli military activity
followed an attack on an Israeli patrol in the zone on Saturday, which left
two soldiers wounded and a Lebanese guerrilla dead.
Syria, blamed by Israel for the upsurge of attacks, said over the weekend
any attack against Lebanon was an attack against Syria.

<TEXT>
MR Matthias Wissmann, German transport minister, said yesterday Bonn would
cancel a 1955 air agreement with the US unless more access was granted to
German carriers, writes Ariane Genillard in Bonn.
Mr Wissmann called on the US government to renew efforts toward 'a fairer
agreement'.
He said Germany would otherwise cancel the existing agreement by September
15.
Mr Wissmann said on German television last night that the 1955 air traffic
agreement 'placed disadvantages on German carriers'. He added that
Lufthansa, the loss-making national carrier, was continuing to lose money on
North Atlantic routes as a result.
Washington and Bonn have been in negotiations for more than a year, without
reaching agreement, on a new air traffic agreement to replace the existing
one, which is widely perceived in Germany as a relic of the post-second
world war occupation.
Negotiations broke down earlier this year and an interim agreement is being
used by both countries. Mr Wissmann said the interim agreement would
continue to be valid if Germany went ahead with the cancellation but that
the US would be forced to open new talks.

FT  19 JUL 93 / Austrian retailers fiddle sell-by dates: New EC-compatible
regulations brought into effect
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   VIENNA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AUSTRIA, the country that a few years ago shocked the world by lacing its
wines with anti-freeze (ethylene glycol) has now taken to fiddling sell-by
dates on packaged foods, especially meats.
It emerged last week that Austrian food retailers routinely take packets of
sausages and sliced ham off their shelves when they reach their sell-by date
and simply repackage them with a new sell-by date.
The practice seems particularly widespread in Tyrol, the heart of Austria's
alpine resort region. Last September the national food testing laboratory
made some routine tests of 29 specimens of packaged meats from supermarkets
there and found that 20 were obviously older than the sell-by date
indicated.
A further test in March revealed similar results.
What happened as a result of these tests is rather murky. The food examiners
claim that they alerted Mr Michael Ausserwinkler, the health minister, of
the abuses as early as October.
Mr Ausserwinkler, something of a health and fitness fanatic himself, claims
he received the first indications of trouble only in April, but did not
inform the public immediately because he wanted to gather material for a
proper prosecution.
The legal position is also vague. The existing regulations, dating from
1973, permit repacking and redating foods, provided that they are not
rotten. The practice of publishing sell-by, consume-by recommendations is
only voluntary.
A new, tougher law, to bring Austrian practice into line with that in the
European Community has been passed but the compulsory package labelling
rules were not to come into force until the end of next year. Meanwhile,
tests carried out in other areas of the country revealed similar abuses in
Styria, Carinthia and Vienna and implicated all the main supermarket chains.
The Vienna tests of 148 samples revealed that 45 per cent of packaged meats
were either rotten, dangerous to health or bore false labelling.
Mr Ausserwinkler has reacted by bringing the new EC-compatible regulations
into effect immediately in respect of meat products. He has rejected calls
for his resignation and won a full endorsement from Chancellor Franz
Vranitzky on Friday.
Data published that day, however, indicated that the abuse extends to fish,
dairy and bakery products.
Although the Austrian media have shouted outrage about the scandal, ordinary
Austrians seem phlegmatic about it all. 'No one has been killed or become
ill,' one Vienna businessman said with a shrug.

<TEXT>
THE British-owned Virgin megastores opened in France yesterday, following
another victory in their battle to trade on Sundays.
A Paris tribunal on Saturday rejected a complaint by the CGT, the French
union organisation, which demanded Virgin's Paris and provincial stores be
closed for the day under the country's 1906 Sunday trading law. The tribunal
said the complaint 'could not be upheld in its current form'.
The dispute arose after the government refused to renew a one-year
'derogation' which had allowed Virgin to open its megastores on Sunday.
Virgin is appealing against the decision.
There are signs that, faced with rising unemployment, the French government
may have sympathy with their cause. Mr Michel Giraud, the employment
minister, said last week that he 'was not hostile to an eventual reopening
on the condition that it created jobs'.
Last Friday Mr Patrick Zelnick, the chief executive of Virgin France, sought
to convince the minister on this score, presenting a five-year plan for the
training and recruitment of about 1,000 people. Virgin says that its Paris
megastore receives about 20 per cent of its weekly sales on Sunday and that
permission to trade on that day would allow it to maintain staff levels in
Paris and to open more stores in provincial cities.
The CGT, however, continues to resist Virgin's bid for Sunday trading.
Citing the support of the nation's small shopkeepers, the union's Paris
branch has called for the public authorities to 'take all the necessary
actions to ensure respect of the law'.

FT  17 JUL 93 / Project to build warship agreed
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN yesterday signed a memorandum of understanding with France and Italy
to jointly develop and produce a warship.
The Common New Generation Frigate, which is expected to enter service early
next century, will be the first significant maritime collaboration between
the three nations.
The Ministry of Defence said the project was at a very early stage. It
added: 'It's an encouraging sign that we've got this far. It will need
considerably more detailed negotiations between partners . . . but it is a
good example of European co-operation.'

NEITHER Iraqi nor United Nations officials reported progress yesterday after
two rounds of talks in Baghdad aimed at resolving a confrontation over
Iraq's refusal to permit UN monitoring of two missile testing sites, writes
Mark Nicholson in Amman.
The UN delegation, headed by Mr Rolf Ekeus, chairman of the UN special
commission into Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, said he would hold more
talks late yesterday with an Iraqi team led by Mr Tarek Aziz, the deputy
prime minister. An earlier session between the UN team and Mr Aziz made
little headway.
Mr Ekeus also met Mr Mohammed Saeed al-Sahaf, Iraq's foreign minister, on
Thursday.

FT  17 JUL 93 / US to report on Pyongyang soon

THE US yesterday promised a 'substantive' announcement next week on its
talks with North Korea over two suspect nuclear sites and Pyongyang
officials said the negotiations were making good progress, Reuter reports
from Geneva.
Mr Robert Gallucci, the assistant secretary of state and the US delegation
leader, said the talks, which opened on Wednesday and had been expected to
end on yesterday, would be extended to next Monday.
'We expect that we will have something substantive to share with you after
Monday's meeting,' Mr Gallucci said in a three-line statement issued by the
US mission in Geneva.
Following his statement, Mr Pak Chang Rim, a spokesman for the North Korean
mission told reporters the decision to continue until Monday 'shows that the
negotiations are going well'.
The talks concern US demands that North Korea open up two sites near its
Yongbyon nuclear reactor north of the capital to inspection by the
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), something the North Koreans have
so far refused to do.
Washington, worried that North Korea may develop a nuclear weapon and spark
a crisis in Asia, has threatened to seek United Nations sanctions against
Pyongyang unless it agrees to IAEA inspections.
North Korea denies it is developing nuclear arms but caused alarm in March
by announcing that it was pulling out of the 1968 Non-Proliferation Treaty,
which bans non-nuclear states from acquiring atomic weapons.
Negotiations with the US in New York last month led to North Korea
suspending that threat. Western officials say the dispute centres on two
buildings at Yongbyon which they suspect could be storing plutonium  - a
basic ingredient of nuclear weapons - that North Korea has not declared to
the IAEA.
Neither side has given details of the Geneva talks, but an important theme
is believed to be what Pyongyang calls the need for 'impartiality' by the
IAEA, a Vienna-based agency which checks that nuclear fuel is not being
diverted for military purposes.
