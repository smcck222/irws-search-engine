STATE-OWNED Minero Peru has set September 10 as the date for the sale of its
Cerro Verde copper mine, a 'world-class deposit' that has attracted keen
interest among top international companies, according to Mr Raul Otero, the
company's president, Reuter reports from Lima.
Distribution of the privatisation rules to the 19 mining companies
prequalified to bid for Peru's fourth most important copper mine was to
begin this week, he said.
The minimum price and minimum investment requirement for Cerro Verde,
1,000km south of Lima in the southern region of Arequipa, would be announced
a month before the sale, Mr Otero added.
'We have yet to fix the minimum price and we still have to determine how
we'll fix the minimum investment because we need to look at the alternatives
and what is acceptable for us,' he said.

AGIP OIL Company of Nigeria has signed a production-sharing contract to
develop two deep water concessions south of Benin.
Under terms revised by the Nigerian government early this year, Agip is the
latest of several major oil companies to sign a production-sharing contract
for deep water concessions off the Niger delta. The company will fund all
the development in return for lower tax and royalties to the government once
it is producing oil.
Those terms replace the joint ventures with Nigeria's state oil company,
NNPC, in which the multinationals were only allowed 40 per cent. Agip paid a
signing fee of Dollars 35m and is committed to spend at least Dollars 100m
developing blocks 211 and 316 south of Benin city. It expects to start work
in the last quarter of 1993.
The company has three other interests in Nigeria. It is the operator of  -
and 20 per cent shareholder in - a joint venture with NNPC and Philips of
the US, and has a 5 per cent stake in a venture with NNPC, Shell and Elf
that produces about half of Nigeria's oil.
In addition, Agip Energy and Natural Resources has a service contract with
NNPC at Nigeria's deepest offshore production field, Agbara.

New York SILVER traders resumed their bullish stance after Wednesday's late
sell-off, lifting the metal's price sharply. In London the spot quotation
closed 10 cents up at Dollars 5.07 1/2 a troy ounce. Having found support at
Dollars 4.95 an ounce the market was buoyed by short-covering and bargain
hunting. GOLD recovered Wednesday's fall, closing in London at Dollars 394
an ounce, up Dollars 1.75. But dealers said confidence had been drained by
repeated failures to break decisively through the Dollars 400 barrier and
questioned whether profit-taking at Dollars 395 could be repelled. Robusta
COFFEE prices at the London Commodity Exchange surrendered more of their
early-week gain on disappointed liquidation following the continued
non-appearance of the predicted Brazilian frost. The September futures
price, which on Tuesday touched Dollars 1,016 a tonne, closed last night at
Dollars 991 a tonne, down Dollars 7 on the day. At the London Metal Exchange
ALUMINIUM prices continued Wednesday's recovery as buyers were encouraged by
expectations of solid underlying support appearing on any dips. The three
months price closed at Dollars 1,213.75 a tonne, up Dollars 10.25.

FT  16 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Producing and consuming nations
close to new pact
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS

<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
COCOA producing and consuming countries said yesterday they expected to
conclude a new international cocoa pact today, at the end of a fifth and
final round of talks. The pact's centrepiece will be a system of production
management to bring supply and demand for cocoa into better long-term
balance.
With a contentious withholding scheme now abandoned, the accord will have no
provisions for direct market intervention to stabilise prices. The two-week
negotiations in Geneva, sponsored by the United Nations Conference on Trade
and Development, have focused instead on the functioning of a production
management committee to be set up under the new deal. The fine print was
still being haggled over yesterday evening.
Among other things, consuming countries have been arguing for a defined role
on the committee, which will co-ordinate producers' supply plans in the
light of expected market conditions. A separate committee will promote cocoa
consumption.
Cocoa prices are at historically low levels because of structural
oversupply. Although production has been reined back in the past couple of
years, stocks of an estimated 1.4m tonnes continue to overhang the market.
Producer countries will have to agree among themselves how production cuts
should be shared.
Four earlier rounds of talks on a replacement for the 1986 International
Cocoa Agreement, which expires at the end of September, eventually
floundered when countries failed to agree on financing and the target price
range for a scheme to withhold cocoa from the market to bolster prices.
In June the International Cocoa Council, which administers the present pact,
recommended dropping the withholding scheme and liquidating the existing
buffer stock of just under 231,000 tonnes. The gradual run-down of the
buffer stock, due to be discussed by the ICCO in September, will enable
producer countries now in arrears to pay off their debts.
Some 45 nations comprising all the world's major cocoa producers and
consumers are taking part in the talks. Forty of the countries are members
of the present agreement, but Malaysia, the fourth biggest producer, and
Indonesia, also an important supplier, are not members of the accord. On the
consumer side the main absentee is the US, which accounts for a quarter of
world cocoa imports.

FT  16 JUL 93 / Government Bonds: Gilts close little changed despite fall in
unemployed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN and PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CONFIRMATION that UK unemployment is beginning to fall was ignored by a
gilts market which traditionally reacts nervously to such statistics.
Debt prices eased back after the news that the jobless figure had fallen by
7,600 in June - the fifth successive monthly decline - but recovered to
close virtually unchanged along the length of the yield curve.
Although the market has shrugged off previous unemployment data as suspect,
most economists acknowledged yesterday that there was now a genuine downward
shift.
Also, the statistics coincided with long gilt yields being at a 20-year low
and the market being potentially sated by a Pounds 700m five-year tap.
However, the appetite for gilts remains so strong that the tap of five-year
stock was exhausted quickly and bond prices, off a quarter point around
midday, recovered to close firmer for the 10-year maturities and steady for
the ultra longs.
Mr John Kendall, economist with Baring Sterling Bonds, said: 'We still have
nearly 3m people unemployed, so it will be a while before the labour market
tightens to the extent that it is exerting inflationary pressures.'
Overseas investors, who Mr Kendall estimates hold around 18 per cent of the
market - including 8 per cent in foreign central banks - were continuing to
buy.
THE GERMAN Bundesbank's decision to leave its key interest rates unchanged
was anticipated but led to some consolidation in the Bund market yesterday.
Bund futures for September fell 0.25 to 96.11 as the German central bank was
unable to draw investors' attention away from the pressures within the
European exchange rate mechanism.
FRENCH government debt prices held relatively steady, despite the
Bundesbank's failure to cut rates. On the Matif, September futures eased
0.14 to 119.82.
One economist suggested that once the German central bank eases, speculators
will know that it will feel unable to cut rates again for some time.
Consequently, they might begin to sell the franc more heavily without fear
of being punished by rate shifts.
AMONG the high yielders, Italian government bonds saw profit-taking
following a recent strong performance. However, yesterday' auction of
L1,500bn of 10-year BTPs saw the net yield fall to 9.53 per cent from 9.76
per cent previously. The result was at the more optimistic end of forecasts.
In Portugal, an auction of 10-year government bonds was also aggressively
bid, even though underlying bond prices suffered from the general ERM
nervousness. The Es10bn of stock was taken up with the yield coming in at
10.336 per cent against expectations of 10.4 per cent.
LONGER-DATED US Treasuries posted fresh gains yesterday, sending yields to
new lows as the market continued to benefit from recent good inflation
figures.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  3/32 at 107
13/32 , yielding 6.552 per cent. At the short end of the market, the
two-year note was unchanged at 100 9/32 , to yield 3.957 per cent.
There was some early follow-through buying from Wednesday, when news of weak
consumer price inflation provided a strong lift to Treasury prices.
Yesterday's economic figures were less encouraging, although a big drop in
the Philadelphia Federal Reserve's index of local business activity for July
was bullish for bonds. Longer-dated prices were further aided by some fresh
municipal defeasance buying.
The day's other news had little effect on market sentiment. The Labor
Department announced a smaller-than-expected 2,000 increase in weekly
jobless claims, and the Commerce Department announced a 0.2 per cent rise in
May business inventories.

FT  16 JUL 93 / International Capital Markets: Revival of interest in
Moroccan investment - Rabat's privatisation programme has underpinned
renewed foreign attention
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCIS GHILES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOROCCO's return to the international capital markets earlier this week via
a Dollars 25m Euroloan for Omnium North Africain is a clear signal of the
revival of investment interest in the country.
The deal marks the return, albeit for a modest sum, of Moroccan borrowers to
the markets after a 10-year absence following the forced rescheduling of
foreign debt in September 1983. The loan for ONA carries no state guarantee.
Morocco has caught the attention of foreign institutional investors this
year because the price of its outstanding debt has risen from 42 to 65 per
cent of its face value.
Foreign investment, meanwhile, rose four-fold to Dollars 500m in the five
years to 1992 and is expected to increase further in 1993. Today, it
represents 21 per cent of all new investment in Morocco and is expected to
become an increasingly significant in the years ahead.
Morocco's privatisation programme is a key factor encouraging this trend.
The programme is now beginning to get into some sort of stride with the
acquisition by the Swiss Holderbank group of 51 per cent of Scior, the
Moroccan state cement company.
This deal is viewed by international bankers and investment funds as a
watershed in Morocco's privatisation programme. By the end of 1995, the
government plans to sell 112 state companies, worth an estimated Dollars
2bn.
A price tag of Dh1.2bn (Dollars 134m) has been put on Scior, so the sales
dwarfs that of the CTM international bus company, which was valued at Dh320m
and successfully privatised last month.
Of the remaining shares, 24 per cent will be sold on the Casablanca Stock
Exchange, 10 per cent will go to the regional authorities in Oujda and Fes
in north eastern Morocco, where the company's two plants are located, and
30,000 are earmarked for employees.
Some 40 per cent of CTM's shares were issued last month and the offer was
four times oversubscribed - the shares are currently trading at a 34 per
cent premium to issue price. The most interesting feature of that sale was
the keen interest shown by Moroccans living abroad, who picked up one-third
of the shares on offer.
This interest underlines the importance of the Dollars 2.2bn that Moroccan
emigres remit home every year and which could prove a significant source of
capital for the privatisation programme if the local stock market is
developed.
A second success story would provide a powerful catalyst for expanding the
role of the Casablanca exchange. Only 69 stocks are listed, a handful of
which trade every day, usually in tiny quantities.
The stock exchange has traditionally been regarded as irrelevant by Moroccan
businessmen, who go to their banks or tap private sources of finance, often
within their extended family networks.
However, privatisation is encouraging the emergence of investment funds like
Interfina and Maroc Privatisation. Interfina is owned by three Moroccan
banks, the International Finance Corporation and Spain's Banco Exterior.
Maroc Privatisation has a majority of French shareholders, which include
Societe Marseillaise de Credit, Les Mutuelles du Mans insurance group and
Compagnie Financiere Edmond de Rothschild.
The latter is also present, with Paribas and Royale Marocaine d'Assurances,
in Casablanca Finance Group which was set up with a capital of Dh1m. It aims
to develop corporate and investment banking and in time emerge as Morocco's
first investment bank.

FT  16 JUL 93 / International Bonds: Strong European demand for Canadian
dollar deals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STRONG investor demand for Canadian dollar-denominated Eurobonds enticed New
Zealand and Banque Nationale de Paris into the international capital market
to raise a total of CDollars 325m yesterday.
New Zealand's three-year, CDollars 200m bond issue was priced to yield 45
basis points over the 6.5 per cent Canadian government bond due August 1996,
at an annual 7.53 per cent. The proceeds were swapped into floating-rate US
dollars.
The bonds were sold mainly to retail investors in continental Europe.
Hambros Bank, the lead manager, said: 'We've seen a lot of demand for
Canadian dollars recently, partly because there are some redemptions coming
up, and partly because investors like the yield pick-up over US Treasury
bonds.'
Three-year Canadian government bonds have a yield spread of about 170 basis
points over US Treasuries.
The bonds were re-offered at 99.225 and traded at 99.23-99.27 by late
afternoon, according to the lead manager.
BNP's four-year CDollars 125m deal was also targeted at retail investors in
continental Europe and was priced to yield 45 basis points over the 6.5 per
cent government bond due 1996.
Among the day's other offerings, the Kingdom of Denmark's Eurolira deal  - a
two-year, L150bn issue with an 8.45 per cent coupon - attracted considerable
adverse comment from Eurolira specialists.
BCI, the lead manager, said it decided to bring a short-dated Eurolira deal
because of the lack of paper in this part of the yield curve.
The deal was priced to give an annual yield of 8.53 per cent, whereas
one-year Italian Treasury bills pay about 8.9 per cent gross.
Other houses pointed out that existing Eurolira paper maturing in two years'
time trades at yields of just over 9 per cent, making Denmark's deal look
stingy by comparison.
Rival banks described the deal as a flop, pointing out that it traded
outside fees (BCI quoted a spread of 99.85 - 99.90, while the issue price
less fees was 99.855).
Some market participants expressed surprise that Denmark should launch a
short-dated issue at all.
'There is good demand for Eurolira paper but it is at the long end, given
that that is where you see the most gain when interest rates fall,' said one
syndicate official. 'You get so little capital appreciation on two-year
bonds it's hardly worth it.'
Essar Gujarat, the Indian iron company, is planning to launch the first
Indian Eurodollar convertible bond. The company hopes to raise Dollars 60m
with a five-year convertible issue, although the size of the issue can be
increased by 15 per cent if there is strong demand.
It had originally considered doing an international equity offering of GDRs,
following the example of Reliance and Grasim of India.
With a convertible bond, the company hopes to provide investors with some
downside protection.
The indicated coupon is 5.5 - 6 per cent and there is a three-year put at
par, so that if the share price does not pick up, investors get their money
back.
The bonds are callable after two years if the share price rises 30 per cent
above the conversion price.

FT  16 JUL 93 / International Company News: Strong dollar hits Gillette
sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ECONOMIC weakness in Europe and the strength of the US dollar were blamed by
Gillette, the consumer products group, for holding back sales outside the US
in the second quarter. Sales grew by 3 per cent, to Dollars 1.24bn, during
the period.
Net income rose to Dollars 134.7m, or 61 cents a share, from Dollars 120.5m,
or 55 cents a share, a year earlier, in line with analysts' expectations.
In spite of the dollar's strength, Mr Alfred Zeien, chairman and chief
executive, said that blade and razor products had achieved strong gains
worldwide.
Though no figures were released, the company said that sales of these
products had been 'considerably higher' and profits had showed 'strong
gains'.
By contrast, profits fell 'significantly' in the toiletries and cosmetics
areas, due to spending in support of the launch of the Gillette Series range
of male toiletries.
There was also said to have been a significant decline in profits on
stationery products, excluding figures for Parker Pen, whose figures will be
included only from the next quarter.
First-half net income, meanwhile, rose from Dollars 249.9m or Dollars 1.13 a
share to Dollars 277m or Dollars 1.25. The latest figure, however, was
struck before the deduction of Dollars 138.6m, equivalent to 63 cents a
share, for an accounting adjustment, which lowered net income to Dollars
138.4m, or 62 cents, for the six months.
First-half sales amounted to Dollars 2.45bn, compared with Dollars 2.41bn
last year.

NET INCOME at Enron, the fast-growing US oil and gas group, jumped by a
fifth, to Dollars 61m, for the second quarter of 1993 - effectively doubling
its profits on continuing operations, once a Dollars 18.4m gain on the sale
of Mobil stock and other non-recurring items in the same period in 1992 are
stripped out. Earnings per share rose from 42 cents to 48 cents.
Operating income of the group's natural gas pipelines increased to Dollars
71.1m, from Dollars 51.9m a year ago, while earnings from gas marketing
reached Dollars 21.8m, up from Dollars 12.6m in last year's corresponding
period.
Income from power generation fell, to Dollars 17.5m from Dollars 20.4m, due
to construction costs of a new power generating plant at Teesside in the UK.
In a separate announcement, Enron Oil &amp; Gas, the group's 80-per cent owned
gas exploration and production company, reported net income of Dollars
33.5m, or 42 cents a share, more than double its level for the second
quarter of 1992, due to increased production and higher gas prices.

SAFEWAY, one of the largest North American food retailers with more than
1,100 stores in the US and Canada, yesterday unveiled second-quarter net
profits of Dollars 36m, or 30 cents a share.
For the same period of 1992, Safeway earned Dollars 33.3m, or 28 cents a
share. Sales rose to Dollars 3.55bn in the latest quarter from Dollars
3.45bn a year earlier.
The results were slightly better than the 30 cents a share that most
analysts had expected, and Safeway's shares closed up Dollars  7/8 at a
52-week high of Dollars 16 5/8 on Wall Street yesterday.
The company said savings from a labour contract in Alberta, Canada, in the
quarter were offset by additional training costs and lower productivity
associated with new employees.
Mr Steve Burd, chief executive, said: 'We are committed to lowering our cost
structure and reinvesting the expense savings in competitive prices and
improved service. We believe the moderate decline in operating and
administrative expenses as a percentage of sale and the gradual improvement
in same-store sales are indications that our efforts are beginning to pay
off.'
The California-based company offered employees in Alberta a buy-out package
in March. Severance pay to employees who volunteered for the scheme depleted
net income for the first half by Dollars 30.2m, or 25 cents, and by Dollars
2.7m, or 2 cents, in the 1993 second quarter.
The charge was included in the company's operating and administrative
expenses, which rose to Dollars 1.73bn in the first half from Dollars 1.66bn
the previous year.
A year earlier, Safeway took a one-time charge of Dollars 56.2m, or 47
cents, for accounting changes.
Overall, Safeway posted net income of Dollars 34.3m, or 29 cents, in the
first six months of 1993 against Dollars 1.3m, or 1 cent, a year ago. Sales
rose to Dollars 6.95bn from Dollars 6.85bn.

SANYO Electric, the Japanese consumer electronics group, says parent profits
for the six months ended May tumbled 77 per cent to Y2.2bn (Dollars 20m)
while at the consolidated level the group has made a net loss of Y2.7bn.
The company blamed the disappointing outcome on continuing weak demand for
capital investment in Japan, the strength of the yen and sluggish sales in
Europe. It warned of a 'severe' business environment ahead.
Consumer electronics products such as colour TVs and VCRs were still in the
doldrums while sales of high-price home appliances such as air conditioners
and office equipment also declined.
Sales for the parent company declined 8.4 per cent to Y500.7bn. In the
domestic market, they were down 12 per cent at Y334bn due in large part to
declines in audio goods and other electrical products.
Sales fell to Y732.2bn from Y737.9bn. In overseas markets, however, sales
rose 4.9 per cent to Y303.3bn.
With personal consumption likely to remain weak in the current six months,
Sanyo is forecasting annual parent sales of Y1,035bn and net income of Y4bn,
and consolidated sales of Y1,530bn and a consolidated net loss of Y1bn.
The company is undergoing a restructuring aimed at decentralising management
and improving operating efficiency.

<TEXT>
LAIDLAW, the Ontario-based waste services and transport operator, will not
take up its proportionate share of the forthcoming public equity issue by
ADT, its 28.4 per cent-owned international security and vehicle auction
affiliate.
The decision will lower Laidlaw's stake to just over 25 per cent, which will
still leave the Canadian company as ADT's biggest single shareholder.
Mr Donald Jackson, Laidlaw chief executive, said he supported ADT's
refinancing effort, but Laidlaw's resources were best spent on its own core
businesses.
ADT plans to issue 18m shares in the US.
Laidlaw's shares have tumbled by almost 20 per cent since it surprised the
investment community last week with a loss of Dollars 33.6m, or 12 cents a
share, for the three months to May 31. The loss was chiefly due to a Dollars
120m writedown stemming from a review of its US solid waste operations.
Mr Jackson forecast earnings of 6 to 8 cents a share in the current quarter,
slightly below analysts' estimates.

FT  16 JUL 93 / International Company News: Fujitsu to cut staff by 6,000
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FUJITSU, Japan's largest computer company, is reducing its workforce by
6,000 in the next two years in an attempt to lower fixed costs and improve
profits in the face of the continuing weak demand.
The company aims to cut its payroll mainly through natural wastage, by
recruiting fewer new employees and seconding employees to affiliates and
subsidiaries which have or are being set up.
Fujitsu has already established a group within its personnel department to
assist employees interested in finding jobs outside the company.
The company, which owns ICL, the UK computer group, emphasised yesterday
that its plan involved moving only those employees who wished to do so and
said that there was absolutely no question of forced redundancy.
However, its decision reflects the growing strains on the company which has
suffered a sharp downturn in business as Japanese companies have cut back on
investment in information technology.
For the year ended March, Fujitsu reported a loss of Y8.7bn (Dollars 81m),
the group's first deficit since it was listed on the Tokyo stock market in
1949.
It faces growing pressure on its mainframe computer business as well as
increased competition in the PC market, where US makers have stepped up
their marketing efforts and launched a price war in Japan.
The company has already taken steps to try to deal with the changed market
environment. It has implemented a restructuring programme and recruitment
has been slashed from a peak of 3,870 in 1991 to just 300 for next year.

<TEXT>
WESTPAC Banking Corp-oration is to proceed with a planned ADollars 500m
(USDollars 340.1m) convertible preference share issue following shareholder
approval at a fiery special meeting in Sydney yesterday.
The issue, important for Westpac's capital adequacy ratios, has already won
strong institutional support. It was the subject of one of three resolutions
passed at the meeting, but with strong criticism from some shareholders.
The other two resolutions concerned a ADollars 14m options package for Mr
Robert Joss, chief executive, and the waiver of calls on shares held by
nearly 200 executives and former executives of the bank.
A minority of shareholders expressed their objection to all three
resolutions, criticising the size of Mr Joss' options package and what they
called preferential treatment for other Westpac shareholders.
But the resolutions were carried on a show of hands and did not require
polls.
The Reserve Bank said ADollars 600.95m of 7.5 per cent Treasury bonds
maturing in July 2005 were sold at an average yield of 7.213 per cent at
tender. It said ADollars 201m of 12.5 per cent bonds maturing in January
1998 went at an average yield of 6.488 per cent.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US Federal Trade Commission has formally dropped its three-year
investigation into unfair trading practices at Intel, the world's largest
manufacturer of semi-conductors.
In a letter to Intel president Mr Andrew Grove, Ms Mary Lou Steptoe, acting
director of the FTC's bureau of competition, said of its investigation: 'On
further review of this matter, it now appears that no further action is
warranted by the Commission. Accordingly the investigation is closed.'
The FTC, which has never previously confirmed the existence of the
investigation, said it had looked into possible 'unlawful tying or exclusive
dealing practices or other unfair methods of competition' involving the
marketing, distribution and sale of the company's microprocessors and other
computer parts.
The company, which has a large share of the market for microprocessors for
PCs, continues to face private anti-trust actions brought by two of its
competitors.
Mr Tom Dunlap, general counsel to Intel, welcomed the FTC decision, adding
that the company intended to continue with its 'very aggressive, but very
fair intellectual property programme'.
The investigation had cost the company 'many millions of dollars,' he said,
but had not resulted in any changes in business policy.
The decision to end the investigation had been generally expected in the
market. Mr Dunlap expressed confidence the decision would lead to the ending
of private actions brought against the company, since these had been based
on the same documents that the company had disclosed to the FTC.

FT  16 JUL 93 / International Company News: Japan's property loans increase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S leading banks increased their lending to the property sector during
the year ended March on the back of strong demand for emergency loans from
stricken property companies.
According to Tokyo Shoko Research, a private credit research company,
outstanding loans by the top 101 banks to real estate companies totalled
Y55,850bn (Dollars 520.26bn), an increase of 6.9 per cent from the previous
year. The figure exceeded the 2.3 per cent rise in the banks' overall
lending.
While the rise in property related lending in the late 1980s was prompted by
speculative investments, Tokyo Shoko said the latest loan growth reflected
the continuing difficulty in the country's property business.
An increase in advance purchases for public works projects, following the
implementation of the government's emergency economic stimulus packages,
also contributed to the rise.
The 11 city, or commercial, banks were the most prominent in lending to
property companies, increasing loans by 8.7 per cent to Y26,083bn. The seven
trust banks increased lending by 6.6 per cent, the three long term credit
banks by 3.5 per cent, and the regional banks by 5.8 per cent.
Among leading city banks, Sanwa Bank had the largest year-on-year rise in
property loans, increasing its lending by 14.4 per cent to Y3,261.8bn,
followed by Asahi Bank, up 13.3 per cent to Y2,119.9bn.
Mitsubishi Trust and Banking led the trust banks, with an increase of 17.7
per cent to Y1,949.8bn. On the other hand, property lending decreased 2.5
per cent to Y1,801.6bn at Mitsui Trust and Banking.
The percentage of property lending to total loans rose 0.49 percentage
points to 11.54 per cent. Nippon Trust Bank led the list with property
lending accounting for 26.7 per cent of total loans, followed by Nippon
Credit Bank at 23.8 per cent.
Sakura Bank topped the list of total outstanding loans to the property
industry, with Y4,551.3bn. Sanwa was second with Y3,261.8bn followed by
Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank with Y3,235.8bn.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SOUTH Korea's 13 main commercial banks reported a 30.2 per cent rise in
combined net profits to Won351bn (Dollars 434m) for the first half of 1993
helped by disposals of securities.
The banks' total operating profits rose by 12.4 per cent to Won1,113bn.
However, there are wide differences in individual performances.
Korea First, Hanil, Cho Hung, and Korea Exchange posted large profit
increases. Commercial Bank of Korea, Bank of Seoul and KorAm reported sharp
declines in earnings as their loan loss provisions grew due to a record
number of bankruptcies.
Meanwhile, the Office of Bank Supervision issued a rare warning to CBK,
criticising it for imprudent lending to Hanyang, a construction company that
went into receivership in May.
Korea First Bank had the largest net profits among the 13 banks with
Won80.9bn, a 77 per cent increase.
KFB attributed the profit rise to rationalisation measures, including
reducing its staff and branch network, saving Won40bn per year. In addition,
it had net gains of Won25bn on the sale of securities during the first half.
Hanil Bank was the second most profitable bank with net profits of Won64bn,
a 32.5 per cent increase, as it sold shares that produced Won31.8bn in
capital gains.
But the biggest profit increases were posted by Korea Exchange with a 310.9
per cent rise to Won41.5bn and Cho Hung with a 282.5 per cent jump to
Won48.2bn. Shinhan remained one of Korea's most profitable banks with
Won54.7bn in net earnings, although this represented a 16.9 per cent drop.
The Bank of Seoul was least profitable with Won600m in net earnings, a 86.7
per cent decline, as loan-loss provisions increased to Won85bn from Won25bn
a year ago.
Net earnings at CBK shrunk by 20.2 per cent to Won9.9bn as its expanded
loan-loss provisions of Won85bn outweighed the Won44.5bn it gained from the
selling of securities.
The profitability of CBK is expected to deteriorate further during the
second half of the year since it holds about Won900bn in non-performing
loans to Hanyang.
KorAm's net profits fell by 58.9 per cent to Won5.8bn as it increased
loan-loss provisions to Won12.6bn from Won1.3bn.

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WESTINGHOUSE Electric, the US conglomerate trying to recover from poor
property investments, reported an 18 per cent drop in second-quarter income
from continuing operations, which it acknowledged was below its
expectations.
The company blamed the drop mainly on the performance of its environmental
business, which it said had been hit by 'weakness in the US environmental
remediation market and the poor European economies'.
Mr Michael Jordan, chief executive, said Westinghouse was in the 'midst of a
great transition'.
Westinghouse reported net income from continuing operations of Dollars 84m,
or 20 cents a share, compared with Dollars 103m, or 30 cents, in the same
period of last year. Revenues were Dollars 1.98bn, compared with Dollars
2.18bn.
The company is gradually getting out of financial services, and in
particular property investment which went sour on it when the US property
market collapsed three years ago.
It said that in the second quarter it had sold Dollars 2.3bn in assets, for
cash, from its financial services business and more than Dollars 3bn in the
first half of the year, and this essentially eliminated the company's
exposure from commercial property assets.
Westinghouse said the sales reduced its financial services portfolio
investments net of reserves to around Dollars 2.1bn, compared with Dollars
5.3bn at the end of December, and it had cut its indebtedness - a primary
goal for 1993 - from Dollars 9.9bn to Dollars 7.6bn.
For the six months, income from continuing operations was Dollars 148m, or
35 cents a share, compared with Dollars 168m, or 68 cents, in the same
period of last year.

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TIME WARNER, the US media group, yesterday posted a 10 per cent gain in
second-quarter operating income, before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortisation (EBITDA) to Dollars 673m.
The improvement, on the back of a 6 per cent rise in revenues to Dollars
3.3bn, reflected strong profits from each of Time Warner's five divisions -
music, publishing, filmed entertainment, the Home Box Office (HBO)
pay-television unit and the cable operating subsidiary.
Time Warner tries to get Wall Street to focus in its EBITDA figures because
its results are muddied by its debt burden and heavy non-cash amortisation
charges.
Although the company is taking steps to restructure its debt, it posted a
second-quarter net loss of Dollars 80m against net income of Dollars 9m a
year earlier. At the per-share level, the company had a loss of 22 cents in
the latest quarter against a loss of 40 cents the previous year.
Time Warner's publishing business posted an operating profit of Dollars 105m
before interest and depreciation, compared with Dollars 88m a year earlier.
The music division had Dollars 136m of operating profits before interest and
depreciation, compared with Dollars 126m.
The filmed entertainment business had record earnings before tax and
depreciation of Dollars 105m, against Dollars 101m a year ago. The company
said US box office revenues were led by the films Dave, Made in America and
Dennis The Menace.
HBO also had a record second quarter, achieving operating earnings of
Dollars 57m, compared with Dollars 53m, before interest and taxes.
Time Warner's cable television business turned in a record earnings before
interest and deprecation of Dollars 270m, up from Dollars 244m the previous
year, reflecting an increase in the number of subscribers and continued
growth in advertising and pay-per-view revenue.
For the first half, Time Warner had earnings before interest, taxes,
appreciation and amortisation of Dollars 1.3bn on revenues of Dollars 6.5bn,
compared with EBITDA of Dollars 1.17bn on revenues of Dollars 6.1bn a year
earlier.
The group suffered a first half net loss of Dollars 95m, against net
earnings of Dollars 12m.
On a per-share basis, Time Warner recorded a first half net loss of 55 cents
against a net loss of 80 cents a year ago.

<TEXT>
THE THREE biggest unions at United Airlines, one of the largest US carriers,
yesterday said they intended to offer the company a package which would cut
employee costs significantly in exchange for a substantial equity stake in
the company.
The carrier said yesterday it 'will be in a position to respond after
receiving and evaluating a direct and specific communication' from the
coalition.
The proposed offer from the pilots, flight attendants and machinists has
strong parallels with a scheme at Northwest Airlines, where the main unions
are negotiating to help the carrier save nearly Dollars 900m and avert a
bankruptcy filing.
Under the terms of an agreement with the pilots' union, employees at
Northwest will have the option of being repaid for their concessions within
10 years of receiving as much as 37.5 per cent of the company's common
stock. Similarly, unions at TWA, which hopes to emerge from Chapter 11 later
this summer, have made big concessions in exchange for a large equity stake
in the reorganised airline.
The coalition of United's unions said its proposal would include significant
employee participation in the governance of the carrier. It would also
consider a new competitive action plan which would help United respond
aggressively to the challenges now facing the airline industry.
United's unions have attempted to gain control of the carrier four times
since 1987, including a Dollars 4.38bn buy-out bid by pilots in 1990.
Although the terms of the latest proposal have not been finalised, it is
unlikely to be structured as a leveraged buy-out. The coalition has not
specified the size of the equity stake it would request from the company,
nor did it specify expected labour cost savings.
UAL, United's parent com pany, recently said it would make deeper than
expected capacity cuts on its US routes in reaction to grim industry
conditions.
It also warned that overseas growth would be more modest than planned. In
January, the Chicago-based company said it hoped to cut annual costs by
around Dollars 400m by axeing 2,800 jobs and not going ahead with plans to
hire 1,900 people this year.
Mr Stephen Wolf, United chairman, warned that the 'fundamental flaws in our
industry are still pervasive and threaten our long-term financial health'.
Some analysts suggested that yesterday's announcement was a sign that the
unions recognise pressure in the airline industry and might be willing to
negotiate.

AMERICAN Home Products, the US pharmaceutical company, recorded year-on-year
net income growth of 9 per cent in the second quarter, ahead of some
analysts' expectation.
However, this was not enough to prevent its shares falling by Dollars 1 to
Dollars 63 5/8 in the face of a general sell-off of drug stocks yesterday
morning as brokers Smith Barney downgraded the sector.
Net income for the quarter rose to Dollars 287.5m, from Dollars 263.5m, as
income per share jumped by 11 per cent to 93 cents from 84 cents, aided by
the purchase of 4.4m shares by the company in the first half of the year.
Sales advanced to Dollars 1.9bn from Dollars 1.76bn.
The biggest sales growth came from consumer health care products, which were
ahead by 13 per cent at Dollars 354m. The company attributed the growth to
increased sales of oral health care products in Latin America.
First-half sales growth as a whole in consumer health care products was
limited to 7 per cent, due to weak sales in the US analgesic market and 'a
less severe cold and flu season'.
Pharmaceuticals, which accounted for the bulk of the group's Dollars 1.9bn
sales, saw sales volume grow by 7 per cent to Dollars 1.2bn in the second
quarter, led by higher sales of infant nutritional and cardiovascular
products in the US.
Sales of medical supplies and diagnostic products advanced by 9 per cent, to
Dollars 217m.

STEADY volume growth in North America and other developed soft drink markets
helped push up net income at Coca-Cola.
The soft drinks group lifted income by 20 per cent to Dollars 678m in the
second quarter, or 52 cents a share, compared with Dollars 565m, or 43 cents
a share, in the same period last year.
Sales rose by 10 per cent to Dollars 3.9bn.
The group's gross trading margin moved ahead by one percentage point, to
24.5 per cent, as operating cost growth was held in check.
Mr Roberto Goizueta, chairman and chief executive, said that the
'increasingly accelerating volume growth' of the last three quarters augured
well for the future.
Newer markets for the world's biggest-selling soft drink showed strong
growth, with a 28 per cent jump in volume in China and 35 per cent in
Nigeria.
Such markets remain small in comparison to overall sales, though, with the
US accounting for about half of the total.
'In emerging markets like China, Indonesia and east central Europe, we have
only scratched the surface of the consumption potential of huge population
centres,' said Mr Goizueta.
Unit case shipments inside North America grew by 5 per cent, with volume in
gallon shipments growing at the same pace.
Unit case shipments elsewhere in the world moved ahead by 7 per cent, and
gallon shipments by 4 per cent.
The company's shares slipped Dollars  1/4 to close at 44 5/8 in New York
yesterday.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
SOFFEX, Switzerland's futures and options exchange, has halted plans to
internationalise trading, dealing a blow to co-operation plans between
Europe's small but rapidly-growing electronic derivatives exchanges.
'We were about to take a major step toward cross-border trading, and our
board decided to say no for at least 12 months,' said Mr Daniel Grossrieder,
Soffex vice-president. The Soffex board, led by Switzerland's three big
banks, is sensitive to a new stock market regulatory proposal now before the
Swiss Parliament. The legislation would create national stock market
regulation, and would apply to Soffex and to a planned Swiss national
electronic bourse, the EBS.
'We did not want to create the impression that there was no co-ordination
between Soffex and the EBS, by allowing Soffex to go forward on its own,'
said board member Mr Patrick Odier, managing partner of Lombard Odier. 'We
must wait until strategic decisions on the stock side are made.'
Links between the electronic stock market and Soffex have not been formally
declared, but are widely expected, with Soffex likely to adopt some of the
new EBS technology.
The decision will prevent non-resident foreign firms and traders from
joining Soffex.
It will also delay or derail plans for Soffex to link with the Swedish OM
exchange group, with facilities in London and Stockholm; Amsterdam's EOE and
Austria's Otob. Mr Grossrieder said Soffex would go ahead with its
application in the UK for recognition as an overseas exchange.
Last year those exchanges agreed to give each other's members access to
products without creating additional clearing costs, and to share marketing
efforts.

wake of heavy loss

<TEXT>
APPLE Computer reported heavy losses for its third quarter, after higher
than expected charges to cover the cost of 2,500 job cuts announced earlier
this month. The personal computer company said it intends to 'dramatically
reduce its cost structure' to boost profitability.
Apple took a pre-tax charge of Dollars 320.9m for the job cuts and other
cost reduction measures. After charges, the company reported a net loss for
the quarter of Dollars 188.3m, or Dollars 1.63 per share. For the same
period last year, Apple had net profits of Dollars 131.7m, or Dollars 1.07
per share.
Net revenues for the quarter were Dollars 1.86bn, up 7 per cent from Dollars
1.74bn in last year's third quarter.
The ongoing price wars in the PC industry, as well as weaker than expected
sales in Europe, contributed to the disappointing third-quarter results,
Apple said.
It said itmore aggressively on price in its personal computer business,
while reducing its cost structure to compensate for lower gross profit
margins.
'We're confident we can put our business back on a growth path by
aggressively pursuing market share while offering innovative technology. At
the same time, we must significantly, and permanently, lower our cost of
doing business,' said Michael Spindler, Apple president and chief executive
officer.
Mr Spindler was appointed chief executive, succeeding Mr John Sculley, who
remains chairman, last month.
Apple has cut prices on many of its Macintosh products over the past three
months, including price reductions on its popular PowerBook portable
computers last week.
'Early indications suggest that our most recent price reductions are
accelerating our unit shipments,' Mr Spindler said. 'Development of new
Macintosh desktop systems and new PowerBook notebook computers are on
track.'
Apple's new businesses' personal digital assistants, servers, and software
products, promise to contribute to revenue and profits in the coming fiscal
year, he added. 'As a result, we see excellent opportunities for growth in
Apple's future.'
For the nine-month period, Apple reported net sales of Dollars 5.8bn, up
from Dollars 5.3bn in the same period last year.
Net profits were Dollars 83.9m, or 70 cents per share, down from Dollars
432.8m, or Dollars 3.52 per share a year earlier.

<TEXT>
GEORGIA-PACIFIC, the US forest products group, yesterday turned in
underlying earnings of Dollars 5m, or 6 cents a share for the second quarter
ended June 30.
However, a one-time charge of Dollars 8m left the group with a net loss for
the three months of Dollars 3m or 3 cents a share on sales of Dollars
3.21bn. A year earlier, the company earned Dollars 4m or 4 cents a share on
sales of Dollars 3.05bn.
The Atlanta, Georgia-based company said its building products business had a
record second quarter, with operating profits of Dollars 202m against
Dollars 162m a year ago. The pulp and paper business, however, posted an
operating loss of Dollars 14m against profits of Dollars 26m.
Mr Pete Correll, chief executive, said earnings were hurt by prices for
structural panels and lumber, which declined from the first quarter, but he
added that prices have been relatively stable for the last few weeks.
For the first six months, the company had net income of Dollars 38m or 44
cents on sales of Dollars 6.15bn. A year earlier, one-time items contributed
to a net loss of Dollars 54m, or 63 cents, on sales of Dollars 5.88bn.
Weyerhauser, the forest products group based in the Pacific Northwest,
reported second-quarter earnings of Dollars 181.5m, almost double the
Dollars 92.9m the company earned in the same quarter of 1992. Income,
however, was boosted by a one-time Dollars 36m gain from the sale of its
subsidiary, GNA Corp, writes Patrick Harverson. Although profits were higher
than a year ago, they were lower than the first quarter of this year, when
the company earned Dollars 229m, including a Dollars 44m extraordinary gain
from the sale of its nappy business.
The pricing environment continues to provide a foundation for strong
earnings, said Weyerhauser. The company has also benefited from cost and
productivity improvements. Its timberlands and wood products business earned
Dollars 241.8m in the quarter, and its pulp and paper business Dollars
44.4m. The real estate and financial services units brought in Dollars
12.2m.
The results failed to impress investors. Weyerhauser's stock fell Dollars 2
1/8 to Dollars 40 1/4 on the New York Stock Exchange.
Boise Cascade, the Idaho-based paper, office and building products company,
reported a loss for the second quarter of Dollars 17.1m, down sharply from
the Dollars 45.4m deficit recorded in the same three months of 1992 but
slightly larger than the Dollars 12.1m loss in the first quarter this year.
The result reflects a modest slowdown in sales and a sharp drop in lumber
and plywood prices, which hit the building products division. Sales totalled
Dollars 974m compared with Dollars 984m in the previous quarter.
Losses from the paper business were significantly lower thanks to higher
pulp and paper prices and a reduction in manufacturing costs.
Boise Cascade shares were little changed on the NYSE, down just Dollars  1/8
at Dollars 22 5/8.

<TEXT>
OM, the Swedish securities and derivatives exchange operator and clearer,
said net profit after financial items in the first six months of 1993 jumped
to SKr100.1m (Dollars 12.7m) from SKr44.1m in the same 1992 period, Reuter
reports from Stockholm.
The company said higher volumes, specifically in share options exchange
trade and clearing of interest rate futures, had boosted income while costs
fell. Outside Sweden, OM also runs OMLX, the London Securities and
Derivatives Exchange.
Operating income rose 34 per cent to SKr190.7m and operating costs fell 8
per cent to SKr129.9m, resulting in operating profit rising steeply to
SKr60.7m from SKr1.1m.
Turnover in interest rate futures, of which OM has seven different Swedish
contract types, rose in the period to an average of 44,763 per day from
26,668 in the first half of 1992.
However, the average rate has slowed from a 48,585 per-day mean during the
first quarter of 1993.
'We had larger volatility of interest rate contracts earlier this year than
we had during the second quarter, but still we have a level of turnover that
is substantially higher than last year,' said Mr Michael Kongstad, head of
information.
A trigger for the increased use of interest rate futures was the Swedish
krona's flotation from its Ecu peg last November.

TRANS World Airlines suffered a net loss of Dollars 19.5m in May, compared
with an April loss of Dollars 27.2m, according to papers filed in a US
Bankruptcy Court, Reuter reports from Wilmington, Delaware.
The airline, which hopes to emerge from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection at
the end of August, reported an operating loss of Dollars 11.9m in May,
against a Dollars 16.8m loss in April, the papers said.
TWA has operated under Chapter 11 since January 1992. Earlier this week the
airline named Mr William Howard as chairman and as a result of the
appointment, the bankruptcy court hearing to confirm TWA's reorganisation
was put off until August 11.

WEYERHAUSER, the forest products group based in the Pacific Northwest,
yesterday reported second-quarter earnings of Dollars 181.5m, almost double
the Dollars 92.9m the company earned in the same quarter of 1992.
Quarterly income, however, was boosted by a one-time Dollars 36m gain from
the sale of its subsidiary, GNA Corp.
Although profits were higher than a year ago, they were lower than the first
quarter of this year, when the company earned Dollars 229m, which included a
Dollars 44m extraordinary gain from the sale of Weyerhauser's nappy
business.
Overall, the favourable pricing environment continues to provide a
foundation for strong earnings at Weyerhauser. Environmental constraints on
logging in the Pacific Northwest, designed to help preserve endangered
species of owl, have pushed prices for logs, lumber and plywood sharply
higher this year.
The company said it had also benefited from cost and productivity
improvements. Weyerhauser's timberlands and wood products business earned
Dollars 241.8m in the quarter, and its pulp and paper business Dollars
44.4m. The real estate and financial services units brought in Dollars
12.2m.
Yesterday's earnings news failed to impress investors, who sold
Weyerhauser's stock down Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 40 1/2 on the New York
Stock Exchange.
Boise Cascade, the Idaho-based paper, office and building products company,
yesterday reported a reduced loss for the second quarter of 1993 of Dollars
17.1m, down sharply from the Dollars 45.4m shortfall recorded in the same
three months of 1992.
The latest loss, however, was slightly larger than the Dollars 12.1m
incurred in the first quarter of this year.
This was primarily a reflection of a modest slowdown in sales during the
past three months and a sharp drop in lumber and plywood prices, which hit
Boise Cascade's building products division. Overall, sales totalled Dollars
974m between April and June, compared with Dollars 984m in the previous
quarter.
Losses from the company's paper business were significantly lower than a
year ago and three months ago, thanks to flat-to-higher pulp and paper
prices, and a reduction in unit manufacturing costs.
However, Mr John Fery, chairman of Boise Cascade, said market conditions in
the paper business remained difficult, although he expected paper prices to
rise further in the third quarter.
The office products division enjoyed a good quarter, with dollar sales
volume rising 7.5 per cent from the year-ago period. Income from the
building products unit was also higher than a year ago, but was down
significantly from the first quarter due to lower lumber and plywood prices.
Boise Cascade shares were little changed on the New York Stock Exchange,
down just Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 22 1/2 .

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RISING production at the Goldstrike mine in Nevada has enabled American
Barrick, the Toronto-based gold producer, to post another jump in quarterly
earnings.
Net second-quarter earnings rose to USDollars 57.2m or 20 cents a share from
Dollars 36.8m or 13 cents a year earlier. The per-share figures reflect a
two-for-one share split last March.
Revenues climbed to Dollars 175.2m from Dollars 115.5m.
The average gold price received in the second quarter was Dollars 410 per
ounce, down from Dollars 422 a year earlier. Barrick's extensive hedging
programme again ensured it received a price well above current market
levels, but meant it did not benefit from the recent jump in precious metal
prices.
Goldstrike's output rose to 356,900 ounces from 238,300 ounces a year
earlier, contributing 83 per cent of production from Barrick's four mines in
the US and Canada.
Average cash costs fell to Dollars 201 from Dollars 229 per ounce, with
costs at Goldstrike dropping to Dollars 194 from Dollars 219.
The company said it was now processing only high-grade sulphide ore at
Goldstrike. However, grades have fallen since sulphide-bearing ore was first
mined late last year. The average second-quarter grade was 0.26 ounces per
ton, down from 0.31 in the first three months.
Besides expansion at Goldstrike, Barrick's exploration and development
activities are focused on Latin America. It has recently opened offices in
Mexico and Chile.

<TEXT>
BUDAPEST'S capital market has added another instrument to its increasingly
sophisticated portfolio with the issue of redeemable preference shares by
Petofi Nyomda, Hungary's leading packaging concern.
Petofi has issued Ft1.35bn (Dollars 14.4m) worth of the securities, which
have a fixed maturity of five years and carry a dividend of 17 per cent.
Credit Suisse First Boston Budapest, arranger of the issue, has placed the
paper with Hungarian institutions.
For investors the redeemable preference shares behave like bonds but the
advantage is that payments in the form of dividends are taxed more
favourably than coupons would be.
Petofi is controlled by western funds. Other western joint ventures are in a
similar position and are expected to follow Petofi's lead.
The introduction of redeemable preference shares is a mark of Budapest's
increasing maturity as a financial centre.

DAF group, is expected to be sold to Van Halteren Metaal, a Dutch
family-owned metalworking company.
The Daf subsidiary, along with its former parent, was granted court
protection from creditors in February.
Daf Trucks NV later re-emerged in slimmed down form as a Dutch-Belgian
company, excluding its UK factories, its financing company and the special
products unit, which makes military vehicles and aerospace equipment.
The formal takeover is expected later this week or early next week. Details
were not disclosed, although Van Halteren hinted it might seek additional
investors in DAF Special Products, saying it planned to be the sole
shareholder 'for the time being'.
Daf Special Products has an order book worth Fl 100m (Dollars 53m) and a
workforce of 165, a decline of about 65 from the days when it was owned by
Daf. It also expects additional orders from US defence contractors as part
of 'compensation orders' flowing from Dutch government purchases of US
defence equipment.
Van Halteren, with turnover of Fl 125m and a workforce of 400, specialises
in equipment for the defence and civil construction markets. The acquisition
of Daf Special Products will give it access to hydraulic technology and
expertise in producing aircraft parts.
The family-owned company already owns eight production companies in the
Netherlands and three in the US. It also has a sales office in Singapore.
Daf Trucks is concentrating on producing medium to heavy trucks and is not
longer active in Daf Special Products' field of small military vehicles.

FT  16 JUL 93 / International Company News: Chairman of JP Morgan hails
'exceptional' result

<TEXT>
A SECOND consecutive quarter of bumper profits from trading in financial
markets pushed second-quarter net income at JP Morgan up by a third, to
Dollars 431m, compared with the same period in 1992.
Trading income of Dollars 989m in the first half, much of it from successful
positioning by the bank for falls in European interest rates, exceeded
trading revenues of Dollars 959m earned in the whole of last year. The
company's shares climbed by nearly Dollars 1 to Dollars 70 3/4 in New York,
before easing back to Dollars 70 1/4 before the close, as analysts rushed to
upgrade estimates for 1993 and 1994 earnings.
Describing second-quarter results as 'exceptional', Sir Dennis Weatherstone,
chairman, said: 'Trading performance stood out, with substantial gains in
trading of debt instruments and strong results in swaps and other derivative
instruments'. The company added that 'efforts to increase distribution and
market-making activities positioned us well for declining European interest
rates and appreciating values in emerging markets.'
JP Morgan, which has become one of the biggest equity and bond underwriters
in the US, also benefited from continuing high levels of capital-raising by
US companies. Corporate finance income reached Dollars 115m, up from Dollars
110m in the same period in 1992.
Also for the second quarter in a row, JP Morgan made no additions to
provisions for credit losses, an unusual record among US banks. Total
provisions amount to more than four times the bank's non-performing loans of
Dollars 291m. 'These reserves will be recaptured - it's just a question of
when,' said Mr Thomas Hanley, banking analyst at First Boston.
Trading profits pushed non-interest income up to Dollars 1,116m, from
Dollars 839m in the second quarter of 1992 and Dollars 1,051m in the first
three months of this year. There were also strong gains in investment
management fees, up to Dollars 112m from Dollars 92m a year ago, and fees
from operational services such as clearing and custody, up from Dollars 99m
to Dollars 121m.
Net interest income, by contrast, fell to Dollars 424m from Dollars 434m,
reflecting a shift towards trading-related activities. This was partially
offset by gains from trading interest rate products, the bank said. Earnings
per share, at Dollars 2.12, were slightly down from the first quarter's
Dollars 2.16 (Dollars 1.47 after the effect of accounting changes).

FT  16 JUL 93 / International Company News: Amsterdam sells Hoogovens stake

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE CITY of Amsterdam yesterday sold its 5.24 per cent stake in Hoogovens,
the Dutch steel group, to domestic and international institutions.
The shares, worth Fl 47m (Dollars 25m), were placed with the institutions by
ABN Amro, the Dutch bank.
The city of Amsterdam, which has owned shares in the company since before
the Second World War, said it stood to make a book profit of Fl 19m on the
deal.
The proceeds will be used to reduce borrowing, saving the Dutch capital an
annual Fl 2m in interest charges.
Hoogovens has not paid a dividend for two years. Its net loss widened
sharply to Fl 595m in 1992 from Fl 51m in 1991, partly reflecting heavy
provisions for job cuts and write-offs as it struggles to weather the
difficult economic climate in Europe.
The sale of the shares was announced after the close of trading on the
Amsterdam bourse, where Hoogovens' shares closed barely changed at Fl 39.80
compared with Fl 40.10 on Wednesday.
Like other cyclical shares, Hoogovens has risen sharply in recent weeks on
expectations of economic recovery in 1994.
Amsterdam said its shareholding had been a legacy of its involvement in job
creation schemes in the region before the Second World War. This type of
industrial policy in the steel sector was now a matter for national and
international authorities, it noted.
The national government owns slightly more than 12 per cent of Hoogovens,
which is based in Ijmuiden on the North Sea coast near Amsterdam. Its
shareholding was reduced in the mid-1980s from an original 20 per cent.
The city spokesman said he believed Hoogovens was Amsterdam's only holding
in a bourse-listed company.
The city does, however, participate in the capital of organisations such as
Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport.
Government ownership of companies is relatively rare in the Netherlands. In
the late 1980s, the Dutch state sold nearly 70 per cent of its shares in
DSM, the chemicals group, in two tranches.
In early 1994, it is planning to sell the first tranche of shares in the
Dutch PTT in a transaction that will rank as the country's biggest
privatisation.

FT  16 JUL 93 / International Company News: Sanofi Winthrop takes control
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SANOFI WINTHROP, a joint venture between Elf Sanofi of France and Sterling
Winthrop of the US, has bought control of Chinoin, the Hungarian
pharmaceuticals company.
Sanofi Winthrop gained control through a purchase of 11 per cent of the
shares of the Hungarian company. It had held 40 per cent of the shares since
1991.
Chinoin is Hungary's second largest pharmaceuticals company. In 1992 it
reported sales of about FFr611m (Dollars 104m) and post-tax profits of
FFr311m. Sales in the first half of 1993 increased by about 30 per cent to
FFr370m, compared with the same period last year.
Sanofi Winthrop is an alliance between Elf Sanofi, the pharmaceuticals arm
of the Elf oil group of France, and Sterling Winthrop, a division of Eastman
Kodak of the US.
Elf Sanofi said that the increased stake in Chinoin was in line with Sanofi
Winthrop's policy of expanding its presence in eastern Europe.
Rhone-Poulenc, the French pharmaceuticals company, plans to cut the
workforce of its French fibres operation by about a quarter by the end of
1995.
The company said that 522 jobs would be lost from a total workforce in
France of about 2,000. All but 75 of those affected will take early
retirement or be found jobs in other divisions of Rhone-Poulenc.
A spokesman for Rhone-Poulenc Fibres blamed the job losses on the difficult
conditions in the fibres market. He said that the company, which principally
manufactures nylon and polyester, had suffered losses as a result of a sharp
decline in prices and increased competition from eastern Europe and
south-east Asia producers.

IN TURKEY'S biggest bank takeover, Turk Dis Ticaret Bankasi (Disbank), the
trade finance bank set up by Isbank, Turkey's largest commercial bank, has
been bought by a private group for Dollars 213.6m.
Lapis Holding, an Istanbul-based partnership involved in gold trading and
tourism, bought Isbank's 89 per cent stake in Disbank. Payment will be made
in instalments over three years, with Dollars 75m paid immediately.
Originally a collaboration between Isbank and Bank of America, Disbank has
23 branches and made profits of Dollars 24m for 1992 on assets of Dollars
514m.
The disposal is the latest move by Isbank to reduce its share participations
in order to bring its own balance sheet in line with capital requirements
set by the Bank for International Settlements.
Lapis started in gold manufacturing and trading, but has diversified into
tourism, carpets and leather businesses. The group is the majority owner of
TYT, the small Turkish Tourism and Trade Bank, and has a 30 per cent stake
in Kanal 6, the television venture of Mr Ahmet Ozal, son of the former
Turkish president Mr Turgut Ozal.

<TEXT>
LYONNAISE des Eaux Dumez, the French industrial and utility group, is
working on a recovery plan for a subsidiary in its construction division
which has suspended debt payments with outstanding liabilities of about
FFr220m (Dollars 37m).
The subsidiary, Maillard &amp; Duclos, is the biggest building and public works
company in the Rhone-Alps region of France. Dumez, acquired by Lyonnaise
three years ago, has been using Maillard &amp; Duclos to expand its construction
activities in south-eastern France.
Maillard &amp; Duclos has bought a series of small and medium-sized companies in
the region since it was itself acquired by Dumez in 1987.
Last year, Maillard &amp; Duclos achieved sales of FFr850m and suffered losses
of about FFr21m. It employs about 690.
Dumez said that the recovery plan would be finalised within a few days. He
said that the company had recently dismissed Mr Robert Bouracho, chairman of
Maillard &amp; Duclos, and placed Mr Jean Pierre Fenayon, deputy managing
director of Dumez, in charge of the Rhone-Alps region.
One construction analyst described the cessation of payments at Maillard &amp;
Dumez as another setback for Dumez, which has suffered as a result of the
downturn in the European construction industry. In 1992, the construction
activities of Lyonnaise - of which Dumez is the biggest part - reported
losses of FFr461m, almost double those of the previous year.
Sales at Karstadt, Germany's largest department store group, rose by 'more
than 1 per cent' to DM10bn (Dollars 5.8bn) in the first six months of the
year, writes David Waller in Frankfurt.
Mr Walter Deuss, managing director, said sales at the parent company climbed
at a slightly higher rate of 1.3 per cent to DM5.94bn.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SANDOZ, the Swiss pharma-ceutical and chemicals group, reported consolidated
net income up 10 per cent in the first half to SFr998m (Dollars 660.7m), and
said 'a significant increase in earnings is also expected for the full
year'.
However, sales advanced only 2 per cent in the first six months to SFr8bn,
with growth hurt by the substantial cuts in prices paid for drugs by some
European governments. In the second quarter, group sales were up only 0.9
per cent to SFr3.82bn.
Sandoz said the strong profit growth was due to 'efficient cost management
and improved margins'. It was the first time that the group had published an
interim net income figure.
Pharmaceutical sales were flat in the second quarter at SFr1.77bn. Positive
developments in the US and Japan were outweighed by a slowdown in Germany
and Italy. However, growth was expected to accelerate in the second half,
due in part to the introduction of new products.
Sales of seeds fell 11.5 per cent to SFr245m in the second quarter due to
the sale of non-strategic activities and negative currency impacts.
The nutrition division, where sales were down 7.5 per cent in the second
quarter to SFr445m, was also affected by currency conversions.
Chemical sales were flat at SFr669m, but grew in volume terms as gains in
North and South America and in Asia offset results in recession-plagued
Europe. Agricultural chemical sales jumped 14.7 per cent to SFr383m in spite
of the negative impact of reforms of the European Community farm support
regime.
Construction and environmental system sales, up 7.4 per cent to SFr306m,
were strongest in Latin America and south-east Asia and weak in the US and
Europe. Acquisitions also contributed.
Saurer, the Swiss textile machinery and motor components group, has
appointed Mr Carl Hahn, the former chief executive of Volkswagen, as its
chairman following the sudden resignation of Mr Vittorio Ghidella.
Italian magistrates have issued an arrest warrant for Mr Ghidella, a former
head of Fiat Auto, in connection with a fraud investigation into the
activities of Oto Trasm, an Italian motor components company that is now a
Saurer affiliate.

FT  16 JUL 93 / UK Company News: End of the Ship Canal battle in sight - One
of Britain's longest and most bitter corporate disputes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MANCHESTER Ship Canal Company yesterday recommended a deal to
shareholders that should end one of Britain's longest and most bitter
corporate disputes.
It should also transform the long term prospects of Peel Holdings, the
Rochdale-based property developer.
The Ship Canal Company, 82.2 per cent-owned by Peel, is offering to buy out
minority interests for an eventual Pounds 33.50 per ordinary share. If it
goes through, the Ship Canal Company will be absorbed into Peel and will
lose its quotation on the Stock Exchange.
The quote will disappear as the ship canal - one of the wonders of Victorian
civil engineering - prepares to celebrate its centenary next year. It still
operates profitably as a port, but the last 10 years have put its best
markets and prospects in land and property, where it is already proving a
sound operator.
Its most alluring prospect is 300 acres of canalside land at Dumplington, on
the edge of Trafford Park, at a nexus of motorways which puts 6m people
within an hour's drive.
After a series of public inquiries, the government last March gave outline
planning permission for its development as a shopping and leisure centre
It was this prospect that first attracted Mr John Whittaker, Peel's
chairman, to the ship canal 10 years ago. The problem, however, was how to
afford a takeover. But then he and the Manchester office of NM Rothschild,
Mr Whittaker's merchant banker, spotted a critical weakness in MSC's share
structure that provided a cheap way in.
There were then 8m shares, split evenly between ordinaries and preference.
The prefs yielded little, so were less than half the price of the
ordinaries, which paid reasonable dividends. But each class of share carried
equal voting rights. In 1985, Mr Whittaker - acting through one of his
private companies - started buying preference shares and any ordinaries he
could get.
By the time MSC's incumbent board woke up to the threat, it was too late. Mr
Whittaker launched a bid in 1986 having already secured the bulk of the
prefs, offering Pounds 6.25 a share for the ordinaries and Pounds 3 for the
prefs.
The market price of the ordinaries doubled, so few ordinary shareholders
accepted, but Mr Whittaker got enough votes by the 1987 annual meeting to
take control. The first person sacked was Mr Nicholas Berry - son of Lord
Hartwell and then owner of Harrap, the publisher - who had bought into MSC
at a premium during the takeover battle and become its chairman.
He developed an intense dislike of Mr Whittaker, whom he thought had got
control too cheaply. He rallied the institutional shareholders to hold out
for a better offer. Because they held a majority of the ordinary shares they
could block any plans they wished. An offer of Pounds 20.70 per ordinary
share was rejected nearly five years ago and Mr Berry has been waiting for a
better one since.
However, recession limited Mr Whittaker's scope. His private companies were
over-extended and he was eventually forced to transfer his MSC holdings to
Peel, the quoted company he chairs. In exchange, he allowed his family's
holdings in Peel to fall below 50.1 per cent, almost certainly increasing
Peel's attractiveness to outside investors, who could previously only watch
him at work.
Three factors have now made possible his settlement with Mr Berry:
Mr Berry's institutional allies drifted away, selling to Peel under
recessionary pressures of their own. The last, British Coal's pension fund,
gave up in February. This left Mr Berry and the rump of small shareholders.
Peel could afford to make an offer.
Peel has pulled through the recession and last week reported a 34 per cent
rise in profits to Pounds 9.4m. It is clearing away expensive bank
facilities and replacing them with cheaper ones and looks well set to leap
ahead as economic recovery gather pace.
Dumplington's outline planning permission made the land's potential value
genuinely negotiable. Even though the government's decision is being
appealed by local authority opponents worried about possible effects on city
centre shops, MSC expects to win, as the arguments have already been
dismissed by public inquiries.
The proposed deal, which Mr Berry thought up and negotiated with Mr Bob
Hough, the MSC chairman, reflects this.
The long-term value of the deal, however, will be to Peel's shareholders. As
Mr Paul Deakin of Rothschild put it yesterday: 'Peel will be able to
consolidate and integrate two attractive property portfolios. This will
enable everyone to get fuller benefit out of the company.'

FT  16 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Recovery signs at Verson as losses drop
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REG VAUGHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VERSON International, the Midlands-based machinery maker, yesterday
announced a sharp reduction in losses for the year ended January 31.
Mr Tim Kelleher, chairman, said the improvement reflected a 'materially
improved financial performance.'
With recession biting, turnover fell from Pounds 90m to Pounds 82.4m but the
group managed to record profits of Pounds 1.58m before interest, compared
with a loss of Pounds 7.64m, after taking account of sharply higher royalty
and service fee income of Pounds 5.57m (Pounds 843,000).
At the pre-tax level the deficit emerged at Pounds 3.27m (Pounds 12.3m). The
results were badly hit by losses from Verson Wilkins, the UK press business,
where there was a sharp downturn in demand for new presses and significant
cost overrun on the contract, Mr Kelleher explained.
Verson Wilkins' overheads have been materially reduced and directors are in
the process of merging its operations with Clearing (UK) and focusing the
business on parts and rebuilding work. Mr Kelleher said that this would
progressively mean a move back to profitability.
The group is moving forward on a plan to reduce dependence on bank debt to
fund expected continuing growth.
On current trading Mr Kelleher said that home market order intake remained
depressed.
Shareholder approval is to be sought to eliminate the deficit on the profit
and loss account leading to a resumption of dividends.

Attributable revenue was Pounds 535,000 (Pounds 735,000) for the six months

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
If interest rates remain low and confidence increases further, John D Wood,
the estate agent, expects to return to profit in the current year.
This follows a significantly better final quarter of the year to April 30,
which enabled the year's loss to be cut from Pounds 497,000 to Pounds
291,000, or from 4.8p to 2.8p per share.
The eight London residential sales offices suffered during last autumn and
winter but the last quarter heralded a recovery in that market as a whole.
The country and agricultural department started well but demand almost
disappeared in the second half of the year.
Turnover at Pounds 4.68m was marginally lower but included a greater number
of sales.

Moorgate Investment Trust recovered from a fall in net asset value at
halfway to finish the 12 months to May 31 with a value of 140.1p per share,
an increase of 9.4 per cent.
Net revenue dipped to Pounds 1.43m (Pounds 1.5m) reflecting reduced deposit
interest and, according to Sir Mark Thompson, chairman, a 'particularly
harsh environment' for dividend payments from UK smaller companies in which
the trust is predominately invested.
Earnings per share emerged at 5.09p (5.37p) and the total dividend is
maintained at 5.5p via a proposed final of 3.8p.
Sir Mark said, however, that the total for the current year would be reduced
to 4.25p.

Olives Property has agreed an out of court settlement regarding the second
of two claims outstanding at the time of the open offer and placing
completed last month.
The settlements together will give rise to an exceptional credit of over
Pounds 900,000 to the profit and loss account. The shares rose 3p to 38p.
The claim by Olives against the Church Commissioners relating to land in
Avon Street, Bristol, was for breach of covenant. The Commissioners had
acquired the site from Olives and had since sold it with the benefit of a
more extensive planning consent than the company was originally granted.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BARBOUR INDEX reported lower profits of Pounds 3.42m pre-tax for the 12
months to end-April as the specialist information services company increased
development expenditure to combat continuing recession in the construction
industry.
The profits decline, from Pounds 3.7m last time, came on turnover of Pounds
12m (Pounds 11.9m).
Mr Jack Dunn, chief executive, said that new sales of microfile services to
architects and planners were very low, reflecting falling architectural
commissions and new housing starts, but that renewal rates were similar to
1992. However, services to civil, structural and service engineers performed
better.
The expanding health and safety microfiles showed substantial growth, Mr
Dunn said, with renewal rates again over 90 per cent. The operation accounts
for 27 per cent of group revenue, up from 12 per cent five years ago.
He warned, however, that moves to accelerate a new generation of services
'may result in our reported profits remaining relatively static over the
next couple of years'.
Nevertheless, the balance sheet remains strong with cash of Pounds 5.51m
(Pounds 5m) and no borrowings. To maintain a 'progressive' dividend policy,
the final is raised to 5.45p bringing the total to 8p (7.25p), payable from
earnings of 13.8p (14.8p).

acquisition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BLACKLAND Oil, a small onshore oil exploration company, plans to acquire
Kingsleigh Petroleum, an energy trading company in China, for Pounds 26.7m
in shares.
Blackland is issuing 761.9m new shares of 1p to Kingsleigh's shareholders
and separately placing 286m shares at 3 1/2 p in a bid to raise Pounds 9.2m
net. The new company created by the deal will be called Fortune Oil.
Kingsleigh is involved in trading oil in China as well as the construction
of an offshore loading point and 15km pipeline. The transaction will involve
9 Chinese businessmen joining the Blackland board including Mr Sun Zhaoqing,
chairman of China National Aero-Technology Import and Export Corporation, as
non-executive chairman.
'What we're buying here is connections in China as well as an earnings
stream from a major engineering project,' said Mr John Mottram, who will be
finance director of the joint company.
Blackland currently has a series of small onshore exploration and production
interests in the UK. It incurred an operating loss of Pounds 321,000 for
1992, compared with Pounds 472,000. Losses per share were 3.59p (5.28p).
Mr Mottram said the acquisition would create the first company with a
sizeable Chinese shareholding to be listed in the UK. The Pounds 9m from the
share placement will be used to pay part of Kingsleigh's investment in the
Chinese shipping facility as well as pay down group debt.

FT  16 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Hampson dips by 7% to Pounds 3.8m and cuts
dividend
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
HAMPSON Industries, the industrial group, increased sales by 8 per cent but
suffered a profit reduction of 7 per cent in the year to March 31.
Following a cut in the interim dividend, the final is lowered to 1.2p for a
total of 1.6p, against 2.373p. Earnings per share came to 3.13p (3.62p).
Turnover was Pounds 79m (Pounds 73m) while pre-tax profit worked through at
Pounds 3.76m (Pounds 4.06m). The group's activities take in aluminium
refining, precision engineering, home improvements, furniture manufacture,
and cleaning.
Mr Ray Ward, chairman, said many of the operations had significant prospects
for organic growth over the next three years.
A reasonable proportion of profit and cash flow would be retained - the
final dividend carries a scrip alternative - to strengthen the balance sheet
and achieve by the end of the period average borrowings significantly below
40 per cent of shareholders' funds.
There was an extraordinary charge of Pounds 1.32m (Pounds 833,000), covering
the loan and guarantee written off to Warmshield and a provision against
certain property values. Warmshield is in the home improvements market but
in receivership. The bulk of the commitment was made in 1989 in return for
an option to purchase 80 per cent of the capital for Pounds 1.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RANK Organisation achieved only a slight reduction in net debt in the 28
weeks to May 15, to Pounds 1.09bn, 60 per cent of which is at fixed interest
rates of nearly 9 per cent. But there are no current plans for a rights
issue, Mr Michael Gifford, chief executive, said yesterday.
'We would like the level of our indebtedness to be a bit lower,' he added.
'But it's an entirely manageable position, we're not going to rush things'.
The scrip dividend offered shareholders yesterday will add to the equity
base but that was not the motive for it.
The interim pre-tax profit rose to Pounds 95.7m from Pounds 19.8m, restated
from Pounds 94m, a year earlier.
Turnover rose from Pounds 935.5m to Pounds 969.9m. Trading profit from
continuing operations was Pounds 66.2m (Pounds 64m) and overall trading
profit was Pounds 66.4m (Pounds 66.1m). Earnings per share were 14p
(restated losses of 7.6p).
Recreation trading profit rose to Pounds 32.7m (Pounds 29m) on turnover of
Pounds 363.4m (Pounds 348m). Social and bingo clubs were buoyant while
casino profits rose on the back of a strong performance in London.
Film and television trading profit fell to Pounds 6.7m (Pounds 7.2m) on
turnover of Pounds 307.5m (Pounds 287m).
Holiday and hotel profits fell to Pounds 7.2m (Pounds 13.6m) on turnover
down from Pounds 153.6m to Pounds 150m. The group said weaker results from
hotels, particularly in London, had contributed to the fall. Of the profits
reduction, Pounds 2m had come from hotels now sold. The outlook for the
holiday side was more encouraging for the second half, with bookings up 9
per cent.
Trading profits from leisure rose from Pounds 15.8m to Pounds 22.3m on
turnover of Pounds 135.3m (Pounds 107m). Hard Rock Cafe and the nightclubs
improved results.
Net borrowings were Pounds 1.1bn, Pounds 74m lower than last year.

The rules, described as an 'interim measure', are nominally aimed at
improving the liquidity in so-called second and third-tier stocks - those
whose market capital ranks them in the bottom two thirds of all shares
traded.
The rules are also expected to boost the profits of the Exchange's
marketmaking members who place their own capital at risk when they agree to
buy large blocks of shares from clients without knowing whether they will be
able to resell them quickly or profitably.
The rules, set to take effect by the end of this year, will be in force for
six to 12 months while regulators assess their effects. If there is no
increase in liquidity among smaller stocks, regulators may ask the Exchange
to scrap the rule.
Under the rule, details of trades 75 times the 'normal market size' for
transactions in any particular stock do not have to be published on the
Exchange's SEAQ price reporting screen for up to five days after completion
or until the marketmaker has unwound or hedged 90 per cent of the risk. All
trades will have to be reported to the Exchange, however.
For large stocks where underlying options are traded, this could include
hedging with exchange-traded derivative instruments. Alternatively, it could
involve the sale of the shares to a third party.

FT  16 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Buoyant markets help lift Jones Stroud to
Pounds 6.5m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JONES STROUD (Holdings), the textiles and electrical accessories group,
yesterday reported pre-tax profits ahead from Pounds 4.83m to Pounds 6.51m
for the year to March 31.
The increase was flattered by a Pounds 609,000 exceptional provision taken
in the previous period. Turnover improved to Pounds 70.9m (Pounds 65.4m).
Mr Philip Jones, chairman, said: 'The rise in profits is due to increased
turnover and more buoyancy in our markets, both in the UK and overseas.'
'We have some new products,' he added, 'and we found late last year that the
recession lifted a bit. We were the first into the recession and presumably
we will be the first out of it as well.'
The group supplies the hosiery, electrical engineering, consumer durables,
clothing and aluminium tube markets. The textiles market was now the
strongest.
Mr Jones said two plants had recently been closed and the vulcanised fibre
business consolidated onto one site. The group had incurred some trading
loss in the previous period because of this.
An increased final dividend of 5.5p gives a total for the year of 8.8p (8p);
earnings per share were 24.85p (18.05p).

FT  16 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Tiphook turns to Wall Street as confidence
recedes - The growing criticism which has been directed towards the
transport rental company
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE 9 per cent fall in Tiphook's share price which greeted the transport
rental company's change of accounting policy was just the latest signal of
discontent from investors.
The wave of criticism following Wednesday's results focused on the confusing
way in which the changes were presented and the growing debt burden on the
recession-struck group. Standard &amp; Poor's, the credit agency, downgraded its
rating of the company from BBB-minus to BB, that is from an investment to a
so-called speculative grade.
Tiphook will from now on report in dollars and said its results would more
closely reflect US accounting conventions because most of its turnover and
financing was in dollars.
The company blamed the accountancy changes for a total charge of Pounds
77.3m, which reduced pre-tax profits of Pounds 55.5m to losses of Pounds
21.8m for the year to April 30.
However, analysts pointed out that most of the Pounds 77.3m provision would
have reduced profits even under the previous convention, although the timing
may have differed. The charges mainly related to the unwinding of currency
hedging and interest swaps, plus the costs of replacing a Pounds 150m
preference share issue with unsecured debt.
Tiphook said it had 'decided to increase the level of conformity of the
group's UK accounting practices with US standards', but was not completely
adopting the US GAAP standard. Thus it will make no allowance for deferred
tax, which in 1992 reduced profits reported under the US rules by Pounds
20.5m.
Mr Robert Montague, executive chairman, said the group intended to remain
domiciled in the UK and report under UK conventions, so it could not make
allowance for deferred tax.
The group has written off Pounds 227m of goodwill against reserves, but may
change this treatment when the new UK accountancy standard is set. Under US
rules, goodwill is capitalised and written off over 40 years. This has the
effect of reducing profits, and in 1992 the group's US accounts showed a
goodwill charge of Pounds 6.2m.
The focus on accountancy tended to divert attention away from the impact of
recession on Tiphook, which operates in 38 countries and has the world's
second-largest fleet of containers - after Genstar - and Europe's largest
fleet of trailers.
Even before the charge of Pounds 77.3m, annual pre-tax profits were down
from Pounds 86.4m to Pounds 55.5m on flat sales of Pounds 324m. Container
utilisation fell from 88 to 86 per cent, although average rental rates fell
by only 2 per cent.
Mr Montague was cautious about the future as the world economic outlook
remained uncertain, but also believed the worst was over.
He said leasing businesses such as Tiphook were much better understood in
the US, and the group has certainly become more popular on Wall Street.
Since 1991 the proportion of the group's equity held as American Depositary
Receipts has risen from 2 per cent to just over 50 per cent. About 65 per
cent of the heavily geared group's Pounds 1bn borrowings are also in the US.
The American enthusiasm has been useful, although it has not prevented
Tiphook's share price being halved in less than two years. The proportion of
UK shareholders has fallen over that period from from 60 per cent to below
30 per cent and now only one UK institutional investor - Scottish Amicable -
retains a stake of more than 3 per cent.
The patience of UK institutions has been strained by unexplained share price
falls ahead of two recent company announcements - a profits warning in April
and last week's notification of the proposed accountancy changes.
Some investors, disappointed by the company's recent performance, have been
pushing for the appointment of stronger non-executive directors and are
suggesting the separation of Mr Montague's roles of chairman and chief
executive.
Tiphook has four non-executive directors on its nine-man board, including
Sir Charles Powell, former private secretary to Mrs Margaret Thatcher. Mr
Montague said there were no plans to change the board.
The group has also been asked to change its remuneration policy for top
directors. Some shareholders are concerned that last year's remuneration of
Pounds 842,000 for Mr Montague and more than Pounds 500,000 for Mr Rodger
Braidwood, finance director, was too high for a medium-sized company outside
the FT-SE 100.
Tiphook's most immediate pressing constraint is on the debt front. In the
year to April, net borrowings rose from Pounds 858m to more than Pounds 1bn,
with Pounds 108m of the increase reflecting exchange rate differences.
Gearing increased from 300 to 470 per cent. The group has agreed more
relaxed covenants on interest cover with its banks, but the group's articles
of association forbid it from having gearing of more than 500 per cent.
Tiphook believes debt will stabilise in the current year. But gearing could
breach the 500 per cent limit if borrowings increase by only Pounds 58m -
not much headroom for a company which last year had a net cash outflow of
Pounds 50m.
Some analysts believe Tiphook will soon seek new equity, and moving to
reporting in dollars will certainly help any fundraising operation in the
US.
Wariness towards leasing companies is common in the City, given recent
unhappy recent experiences with GPA, the Irish aircraft leasing business,
and British &amp; Commonwealth's Atlantic Computer subsidiary.
Faith in management is an essential condition for investing in any leasing
company, given the difficulty outside observers have in understanding their
complex finances. It is because confidence in Tiphook is now so scarce in
London that the group is increasingly looking to Wall Street for support.

FT  16 JUL 93 / UK Company News: ASH benefits from reduced costs and
improves to Pounds 7m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AUTOMATED Security (Hold-ings), the international electronic security
systems company, yesterday reported higher interim profits reflecting
sharply lower interest charges and UK reorganisation costs.
For the six months to May 31 pre-tax profits increased from Pounds 4.92m to
Pounds 7.13m although at the operating level they fell because of margin
pressures in the core UK alarms business.
The year-ago figures have been restated to comply with FRS 3 accounting
standards.
Interest charges were reduced from Pounds 8.93m to Pounds 3.15m and costs
related to reorganisation of the group's UK operations over the past 18
months amounted to Pounds 953,000 (Pounds 4m).
Mr Tom Buffett, chairman, said the first half had seen a continuation of
difficult trading conditions in the UK, while the US operations continued to
expand and perform well. He said the group's overall results were 'about
Pounds 1m below expectations' because of the underperformance in the UK.
Earnings emerged at 2.2p (0.4p). The interim dividend is 3.05p (2.25p) with
the alternative of an enhanced scrip dividend.
Turnover from continuing operations increased to Pounds 74.3m (Pounds 64.5m)
and recurring revenues grew by 17 per cent to Pounds 42m.
Operating profits dropped to Pounds 11.2m, including Pounds 446,000 from
acquisitions, compared to Pounds 19.4m a year ago which included Pounds
5.75m from the discontinued operations.
Mr Buffett said that in spite of tough conditions in the UK the group had
succeeded in retaining its market share.
Revenues from continuing operations in the UK grew by 8 per cent and
recurring revenues showed a 5 per cent increase.
He added that the UK cost base had been substantially reduced by the
reorganisation which included reducing the workforce by some 700 to 2,200.

FT  16 JUL 93 / UK Company News: TT calls for Pounds 51m via rights
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TT GROUP, the rapidly expanding electronics company that is emerging from a
small diversified conglomerate, is to raise Pounds 51m through a 1-for-4
rights issue.
Mr John Newman, a chief executive and former acquisitions manager for Lord
Hanson, said the issue will fund further acquisitions, the purchase of new
product lines and Pounds 40m of capital expenditure over the next two years.
The rights issue comes little more than six months after TT concluded its
Pounds 13m acquisition of AB Electronics with the help of a Pounds 7m
placing at 167p.
The issue is priced at 240p, some 53p below where the shares closed on
Wednesday, and is underwritten by Samuel Montagu. TT's share closed down 7p
at 286p.
Mr Newman said TT had driven a lot of costs out of AB but that it needed now
to take advantage of the emerging recovery. 'We have got to the stage where
we need to invest in automatic equipment to lower the cost base', he said.
TT would also want to buy further product lines and was looking in
continental Europe. The group was also interested in making further
substantial acquisitions in the electronics field.
Without the rights issue, the group would have been constrained by gearing
that is now about 47 per cent after a Pounds 12.1m fall in debt since AB was
purchased.
The group will pay an interim dividend of 2.6p and a total dividend of not
less than 6.6p.
COMMENT
TT's rights issue is proof of what can be done with a City following. Less
than six months after the share placing that financed the acquisition of AB
Electronics, TT has transformed its balance sheet with a well-received
rights issue. The cash call is clearly opportunistic. The shares are trading
only marginally off a record high and the group is clearly spinning off
cash. But in spite of this cash flow, gearing at 47 per cent would have
limited TT's scope for capitalising on its purchase of AB by investing as
the business cycle starts to turn up. The opportunity to make further
acquisitions and buy more product lines is the additional prize for winning
the City's trust. It is now up to TT to repay that trust by showing the
proceeds will enhance earnings.

FT  16 JUL 93 / UK Company News: ShareLink gets Pounds 42m valuation from
offer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARELINK Investment Services yesterday announced an offer and placing of
7.9m shares at 250p each, valuing the telephone-based stockbroker at Pounds
42.1m.
Half of the shares are being offered to the public with the rest placed with
institutions. It is fully underwritten by Hill Samuel.
Trading starts on July 30 when there will be 16.8m shares in issue.
The company is raising Pounds 5m of new money to pay off Pounds 3.5m
redeemable preference shares and Pounds 1.2m of borrowings.
Mr David Jones, chief executive, said he wanted an ungeared balance sheet to
enable him to invest in new services.
ShareLink, which currently specialises in equities and traded options, is
looking at expanding into insurance and banking. Its two biggest
shareholders, Foreign Colonial Ventures and the British Coal pension fund,
both of which have a 32 per cent stake, are expected to sell about half
their shareholdings.
COMMENT
There is no direct competitor with which to compare ShareLink. For obvious
reasons it likes to compare itself with Direct Line, the company owned by
the Royal Bank of Scotland which specialises in telephone insurance and
recently trebled first-half profits to Pounds 15m. But notwithstanding its
plans to expand, ShareLink remains a different animal. It is currently
dependent on the stock market and to some extent must be regarded a cyclical
stock. The issue price represents 16.6 times pro forma earnings per share
before exceptional items and a notional gross dividend yield of 3.75 per
cent for year ended March 31. James Capel predicts that pre-tax profits will
rise from Pounds 3.1m to Pounds 5.5m. About Pounds 1m of the predicted rise
is due to BT3, indicating an underlying rise of 45 per cent. The forecast
puts the shares on an undemanding prospective multiple of just over 11.

FT  16 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Profits warning hits QS shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
QS Holdings, the specialist clothing retailer based in the south of England,
announced yesterday that profits in the six months to July 30 would be
'substantially' lower than the Pounds 3.86m reported last time. The shares
fell 70p to 235p.
Mr Marc Walters, chairman, said the downturn would be partly the result of
lower sales. This followed 'poor weather in April, May and June'; increased
pressure on margins, as prices were cut to shift summer stock; and other
store groups - driven by recession to emphasise the value-for-money side of
their family wear - invading QS' product area.
Mr Walters said the interim dividend would be held at 1.56p. The balance
sheet remained strong with net cash and the expansion policy would continue
as planned.

FT  16 JUL 93 / UK Company News: NatWest Bancorp at Dollars 70m as recovery
gathers pace
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NATWEST Bancorp, the US retail banking subsidiary of National Westminster
Bank, yesterday continued its recovery from bad debts and poor profitability
by disclosing record after-tax profits of Dollars 69.8m (Pounds 46.5m),
against Dollars 35.6m, for the second quarter.
The bank's first-half earnings, which will contribute to National
Westminster's interim profits to be announced in two weeks time, rose to
Dollars 130.5m (Dollars 65.8m).
Mr John Tugwell, chairman and chief executive, said the strengthening of the
core business would continue, but in the longer term it had to raise
revenues and it was investing in non-interest earnings streams to achieve
this.
The bank's provision to loan losses fell to Dollars 24m (Dollars 30.5m) in
the second quarter. The allowance in the balance sheet for loan losses at
June 30 was Dollars 544.5m, or 3.85 per cent of total loans against Dollars
657.5m or 4.63 per cent the previous year.
However, the charge-offs for loans in the second quarter tripled to Dollars
91.6m (Dollars 31.3m), which the bank said related to losses on several
large problem credits for which provisions had previously been established.
Equity capital at June 30 stood at Dollars 1.98bn (Dollars 1.76bn), and the
tier 1 ratio of core capital to risk-weighted assets strengthened to 8.13
per cent (6.65 per cent).

FT  16 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Most ITV shares too high say brokers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STOCKBROKERS Kleinwort Benson warned yesterday that shares of almost all the
ITV companies were 'dangerously high' and advised investors to take profits,
writes Raymond Snoddy.
The only exceptions were HTV, the ITV company for Wales and the west, and
Ulster Television, which were both judged to be cheap.
Kleinwort argues that uncertainty will continue while Mr Peter Brooke, the
National Heritage secretary, declines to state when he will make up his mind
on whether or not to relax ITV ownership rules.
In the absence of firm news, ITV shares, buoyed up by hopes of takeovers and
Granada's purchase of a 20 per cent stake in London Weekend Television,
would continue to drift back, the stockbrokers believe.
Kleinwort also argues that the economic case for allowing the nine largest
ITV companies to merge - something now forbidden by the 1990 Broadcasting
Act - was a weak one.
Larger ITV groupings would be more - rather than less - likely to attract
predators from continental Europe. The fact that 80 per cent of regional
programmes have to be produced locally restricted the cost savings that
could be taken out of the system.
'The Pounds 100m that has been claimed by Carlton as available to be taken
out of the cost base of ITV has yet to be substantiated: it is generally
believed to apply only if all 15 companies were to be merged into one,'
Kleinwort says.

FT  16 JUL 93 / UK Company News: GUS decision could be spur for others to
follow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GREAT UNIVERSAL Stores' decision to enfranchise its non-voting shares will
be a spur for those other remaining companies which have two-tier share
structures. Non-voting and limited voting shares, although common years ago,
are now regarded as anachronistic.
Under the terms of the GUS enfranchisement, holders of the voting shares,
which currently make up a mere 2.2 per cent of the total capital, will
receive an extra four shares for every five they hold as compensation. The
holders of the voting shares will then have 3.9 per cent of the enlarged
capital. After that all shareholders will receive a 3-for-1 scrip issue.
Morgan Stanley International and SG Warburg have recommended these terms as
fair and reasonable on behalf of the voting and non-voting shareholders
respectively. About half of the voting shares are held by the Wolfson
Foundation, the family and other charitable trusts. The remainder are mainly
held by a number of institutions.
GUS's move follows years of speculation, during which time the company has
repeatedly said it was reviewing its position. The timing of its decision
has no particular significance, the company stressed yesterday.
It also follows that of Austin Reed, another retail group, in April to
enfranchise its non-voting shares and the announcement in May by Hammerson,
the property company, that it would equalise the votes on its two classes of
shares.
GUS said it was responding to the 'evident wishes of the company's
shareholders and the market' although saying that there was no shareholder
pressure to change. The two classes of shares performed much in line until
about the mid-1980s when the voting shares began to outperform the
non-voting shares.
It also said it was 'conscious of the impetus towards globalisation of
securities markets and EC views on the subject'.
The Stock Exchange told companies 10 years ago that if they had non-voting
or limited voting shares they must be clearly described as such. There has
also been a feeling - although nothing has been written down - that the
Stock Exchange frowned on the issue of new non-voting shares, for example
through a rights issue or acquisition.
The EC is due to publish a directive - although many think it will not
happen - which is expected to encourage companies towards a unified share
capital. While two-tier share structures are still common in many European
countries, they are less usual in other markets such as the US.
Non-voting or limited voting shares often arise where a family controls or
has a large stake in a company. Other well-known companies with two-tier
share structures include Whitbread, the brewer, WH Smith, the retail and
wholesale group and John Laing, the contracting and construction group.
Such share structures have been used by some companies to frustrate
takeovers. The famous case is that of the Savoy Hotel, which for years
repulsed takeover attempts by the then Trusthouse Forte which owned a large
majority of the shares but a minority of the votes.
There is no suggestion, however, that GUS is about to receive a takeover
approach.

FT  16 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Sun move prompts market confusion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR RUPERT Murdoch's price cutting exercise at The Sun is causing
considerable confusion in the stock market for shares of newspaper groups,
with analysts divided on the consequences.
Mirror Group Newspapers and United Newspapers, in particular, have suffered
in the aftermath of News International's decision to reduce the price of The
Sun from 25p to 20p for the rest of the summer.
At James Capel, media analyst Mr Guy Lamming turned MGN from one of his
strongest buys to a sell and believes uncertainty will remain until it is
clear how long The Sun is going to stay at 20p.
'If Murdoch was to take a possible irrational decision to maintain the price
war it would have a big impact on MGN profits,' he said.
The Daily Mirror, Mr Lamming suggested, could not sustain a 7p price
differential over The Sun indefinitely.
Four days into the circulation war an early pattern seems to be emerging.
The Sun appears to be holding on to a rise in circulation of just over 8 per
cent, but the Daily Mirror is still up some 1.5 per cent with the help of
its Jurassic Park wall chart promotion. Although the Daily Star is being
squeezed by its two bigger rivals, latest estimates put its loss at only 2
per cent.
Overall the popular newspaper market has risen so far by 2 per cent.
The modest sales drop at the Daily Star hardly seems enough to explain a
fall of 28p to 516p in the share price on Wednesday of United Newspapers,
although the Pounds 190m rights issue could be a complicating factor.
Yesterday, the price shed another 2p.
'The market doesn't understand price wars. It doesn't like the uncertainty,'
said Mr Derek Terrington, media analyst at Kleinwort Benson who believes
some institutional investors have also taken the opportunity for profit
talking.
He believes that MGN is fundamentally a strong and resilient business.

FT  16 JUL 93 / Welsh Water gains 12.5% but doubles Acer write-off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WELSH Water, the privatised water company, yesterday reported increases in
profits and dividends in line with expectations and a withdrawal from an
ill-received diversification into hotels.
The company has extricated itself from its hotels business by signing a
15-year lease for four of its properties with Resort Hotels, which will also
manage the fifth.
But five months after acquiring Acer Group, the engineering consultancy
group, for Pounds 21m in cash and the assumption of Pounds 27m of debt,
Welsh Water has more than doubled the goodwill write-off.
The group said the write-off would now be Pounds 40.4m, as opposed to the
Pounds 17m figure anticipated at the time of the purchase.
The additional goodwill write-off has raised the question of whether Welsh
Water paid too much for Acer. Mr Iain Evan, chairman, remains convinced it
was the correct strategic move for the group.
In spite of yesterday's widely welcomed withdrawal from hotels, Welsh
Water's experience with Acer will renew concern about the manner in which
water companies are diversifying into business not regulated by the Office
of Water Services.
The main increase in the goodwill write-off relates to a change in strategy
that led to disagreements within the group and the departure last week of
three of Acer's directors.
According to Mr Evans, Welsh Water has taken a Pounds 12m write-down based
on a 'more prudent and cautious accounting policy' regarding when profits on
five-year contracts are recognised. Welsh Water initially expected this
figure to be about Pounds 7m.
The unanticipated restructuring to integrate Acer, following the
disagreement over strategy with Acer's now departed directors, has led to a
Pounds 7m provision.
The hotels deal entailed a write-down of Pounds 2.2m in the value of assets
in Welsh Water's books.
The company's pre-tax profits rose 12.5 per cent to Pounds 155.5m on sales
up 11.8 per cent at Pounds 382.4m in the year to March 31.
The group is to pay a final dividend of 15.7p, giving a total for the year
of 23.5p, an increase over last year of 9.8 per cent.
Earnings per share rose 17.8 per cent to 104.1p.

FT  16 JUL 93 / Rank pays year's dividend at interim
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Rank Organisation, which includes Odeon cinemas, bingo clubs and Hard
Rock Cafes, yesterday reported a near fivefold increase in first-half
profits.
The pre-tax figure rose from a restated Pounds 19.8m to Pounds 95.7m. Rank
said it would pay the full-year dividend at the interim stage, with an
enhanced share alternative.
The proposed interim dividend of 31p was equal to last year's total payout
and equivalent to what it would have recommended for the whole of this year.
Shareholders have the alternative of receiving new shares to a value of
46.5p per existing ordinary share. BZW has offered a cash alternative of
46.035p.
If all shareholders take up the share alternative, Rank will save Pounds 96m
on dividends and a further Pounds 27.8m of advance corporation tax.
Mr Michael Gifford, chief executive, said that while trading in the US had
improved, there were now signs that recovery there was slowing.
He said that UK consumers divided into three groups. Those unmarried and
under 25 were spending more in the group's discotheques and cinemas.
Those in the 25 to 50 age group with children had benefited from reduced
mortgage payments and were prepared to spend more. This group had become
increasingly price conscious, however, looking for bargains and being
prepared occasionally to accept lower quality.
Pensioners, the third group, had seen income from savings fall as interest
rates dropped, and were spending less. This had adversely affected Shearings
coach holidays.
Mr Gifford indicated that there was no early prospect of the group disposing
of its stake in the Rank Xerox copying business, but the matter was under
constant review. Rank Xerox's contribution to Rank's pre-tax profit fell to
Pounds 68.5m, from Pounds 71.7m. Mr Gifford said: 'There's almost nothing we
haven't considered. Of course we've considered what would happen were we and
Xerox to reach a deal on our stake, but I wouldn't get excited.'
He said the group had sold the White House Hotel in London for just under
Pounds 26m to Alvin Consultants, a UK-based company.

FT  16 JUL 93 / Combatants settle bitter dispute over canal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE of the longest and most bitter corporate disputes in Britain came to an
end yesterday when Mr John Whittaker, chairman of Peel Holdings, and Mr
Nicholas Berry, chairman of Stancroft Trust, agreed to bury the hatchet over
Manchester Ship Canal.
The dispute has been raging since 1986, when Mr Whittaker won control of the
ship canal company after a year-long takeover battle, defended in the latter
stages by Mr Berry, who had bought his way in as chairman. The two have
contrasting backgrounds - Mr Berry, Eton and Oxford; Mr Whittaker the son of
a successful northern entrepreneur - and they have come to hate each other.
Their agreement, which has to be ratified by small shareholders, will pave
the way for MSC to be absorbed by Peel, which already owns 82.2 per cent of
the company. MSC's separate quotation will disappear - 99 years after the
canal opened.
The roots of the dispute lie in MSC's land and property holdings, which give
it an investment potential well in excess of what it achieves as operator of
a profitable small port.
Mr Berry thought Mr Whittaker had won control of MSC too cheaply. He
organised resistance among minority shareholders to veto plans and
eventually force an acceptable offer. The offer, which Mr Berry designed to
be acceptable to himself, was announced yesterday.
The deal comprises Pounds 23 for each ordinary share plus a Pounds 7 zero
coupon loan note, worth Pounds 10.50 in five years, or earlier if MSC gets
full planning permission to develop a 300-acre canalside site at
Dumplington, near Trafford Park as an out-of-town shopping centre. Mr
Whittaker's original offer in 1986 was worth Pounds 6.25 per ordinary share.
Mr Robert Hough, chairman of MSC and deputy chairman of Peel, said the offer
would value MSC at about Pounds 234m. Total minority holdings now accounted
for Pounds 41.5m of this - approximately the total value of the company when
Mr Whittaker won the takeover battle. Mr Berry owns half the MSC minority
holdings by value.
His Stancroft Trust owns Mintel, which is the largest shareholder in Kunick,
the gaming machine company, Grampian Television and Barlows, a property
developer. He is the son of Lord Hartwell, a former owner of the Daily
Telegraph.
Theoretically, the deal can still be stopped. Under MSC's constitution,
approval requires a simple majority of shareholders by number and a 75 per
cent majority by value. The latter condition has already been met, but Peel
and Mr Berry have only one vote each to cast among 2,000 on the register.
However, Mr Berry said the offer was being recommended by the small
shareholders' association.

FT  16 JUL 93 / A tempting glimpse of freedom at GUS: Neil Buckley finds the
UK shopping group taking a rare step into the limelight
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Few companies with a market capitalisation of Pounds 4.7bn have kept such a
low profile as Great Universal Stores. Analysts who travelled from as far
afield as Scotland to a rare GUS presentation last year were incensed at the
company's lack of candour.
Yesterday GUS was the talk of the City, not for its 45th yearly increase in
pre-tax profits - a 7 per cent rise to Pounds 475m - but for its decision to
enfranchise its non-voting shares, ending the Wolfson family's effective
control of the company after 60 years.
But GUS did more than extend voting rights. It enlarged its board by
appointing four new non-executive directors and an executive director,
issued a detailed 16-page press release described by one analyst as 'hardly
Wolfsonesque', and increased the number of shares by a scrip issue to make
them more marketable. Observers were left speculating that a cultural
revolution was under way within one of the UK's more conservative and
secretive companies.
Some hope it might use its large cash reserves to become once again the
dynamic and acquisitive company it was in the 1950s and 1960s.
GUS grew from a retail and wholesale business selling household goods
founded by three brothers at the turn of the century. After the first world
war, it became a pioneer of mail order in the UK, publishing a catalogue
which agents used to sell goods door-to-door.
Mr Isaac Wolfson, son of a Russian Jewish immigrant family from Glasgow,
gained control of the company in 1932 and it was he who used the profits
from the mail order business to expand GUS into one of the UK's largest
retailing groups.
Wolfson began issuing non-voting A shares in 1952, and used these in
combination with cash to fund a series of acquisitions, including the
women's clothing group Morrison's, Jones and Higgins house furnishers, and
Burberrys, the upmarket clothing retailer. By the early 1960s, GUS's
interests encompassed footwear, hotels, electrical goods, builder's
merchants, food retailing and a travel agency.
In contrast to today, its shares were seen as volatile and speculative, and
concern was sometimes expressed about the size of the borrowings.
By the 1970s, GUS was the UK's biggest high street retailer, with more than
2,200 shops. But the mail order business was always the core and in the
1980s GUS sold off many high street interests, leaving it with only
Burberrys and Scotch House, the woollen clothing retailer. However, it
retained many of the freeholds and long leaseholds of the businesses it
sold, the foundation of a sizeable property business.
Today's business breaks down into four divisions with catalogue and home
shopping at the core. The company has a reputation as a solid, defensive
stock, which it seems in little danger of losing.
But is it now about to become rather more than that? GUS is sitting on
Pounds 1.3bn cash, which it is often accused of failing to put to good use.
As one analyst put it: 'We have seen the glasnost, which was most welcome.
But the question is, will we now get the perestroika?'
Mr Richard Pugh, GUS deputy chairman, said the company had been on the
look-out for a major acquisition for some years, but had not found one that
met its criteria of having a good, continuing management, in a business GUS
understands, at the right price.
Analysts suggest the ideal acquisition would be an overseas mail order
company, allowing GUS to utilise its expertise and benefit from economies of
scale. One possible target might be La Redoute, whose parent company
Pinault-Printemps has financial difficulties. But that might run into
monopoly problems, as the French company already owns UK mail order operator
Empire.
An intriguing possibility is that GUS could bid for Next, the UK clothing
retailer which is now staging a recovery.
Next's chairman Lord Wolfson of Sunningdale used to be a director of GUS, is
a cousin of GUS chairman Lord Wolfson of Marylebone, and was one of the four
non-executive directors appointed by GUS yesterday. Mr David Jones, Next
chief executive, used to work for GUS and is said to be keen to run the
business.
GUS sold large parts of its high street empire in the 1980s to Next and to
Combined English Stores, which was later taken over by Next.
David Wolfson's return to the board also points to a possible solution to
the succession problem at GUS, where there is no obvious heir.
Some analysts, however, remained sceptical about whether yesterday's
enfranchisement of the voting shares meant GUS would throw off its
conservative image. Said one: 'I think the most excitement we will get from
it may be what we have had today.'
The results for the year to March 31 showed catalogue and home shopping
increasing pre-tax profits to Pounds 207.7m from Pounds 195.5m. Burberrys
and Scotch House advanced from Pounds 32.3m to Pounds 37m, with Scotch House
announcing plans to open a franchised boutique in Mexico City and Burberrys
a similar one in Shanghai.
Finance, banking and business information services rose from Pounds 137.4m
to Pounds 140.2m; property lifted its contribution from Pounds 50.2m to
Pounds 52.1m.
About Pounds 117m of the Pounds 475m pre-tax profit came from interest
income.
Earnings per share rose from 118.8p to 128.2p. The 10 per cent total
dividend increase to 44p, after a final of 30.25p, exceeded expectations.

FT  16 JUL 93 / P&amp;G details biggest job cut plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   CINCINNATI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PROCTER &amp; Gamble, the US consumer products giant, yesterday announced plans
to cut its workforce by 12 per cent and its manufacturing plants by 20 per
cent over the next three or four years to improve efficiency and combat
intensifying global competition.
The move will mean a Dollars 1.5bn (Pounds 1bn) charge against 1992-1993
earnings. It is the biggest single job reduction announcement in P&amp;G's
recent history though it has closed, or partly closed, 17 plants in the past
five years.
The company will eliminate around 13,000 of its 106,000 jobs worldwide, with
about half the cuts coming from plant closures and the rest from a drive to
reduce overhead expenses.
Some 30 of P&amp;G's 147 plants will be shut, with the total split evenly
between the US and the rest of the world.
Mr Edwin Artzt, chairman, said P&amp;G aimed to take as many of the job losses
as possible through the reassignment of workers, early retirement and other
voluntary measures.
The cuts come against a background of intensifying competition in the world
consumer products industry, where P&amp;G is battling for market share against
multinationals such as Anglo-Dutch Unilever and retailers' own-label
products. This has forced manufacturers of branded products, such as P&amp;G, to
cut prices and rethink marketing strategies.
Mr Artzt expected to generate Dollars 500m in after-tax savings from the
cuts by 1995-1996. The aim was to improve profits growth, either by
achieving better margins or by cutting prices further, and thus building
volume and market share. He insisted the restructuring was not a sign of
trouble at P&amp;G.
'We have a healthy, growing business, a strong balance sheet, positive
cashflow, state-of-the-art products and a well stocked technology pipeline.
However, we must slim down to stay competitive.'
He said P&amp;G had a good fourth quarter and expected to report double-digit
earnings growth for 1992-1993, excluding special reserves and accounting
changes.
Some Dollars 1.2bn of the restructuring charge is for manufacturing
consolidation, with the rest for cost cutting measures.
The company is also taking a Dollars 925m charge to adopt two new accounting
standards.

FT  16 JUL 93 / MPs 'were misled' by Foreign Office on Iraq arms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MPS AND the British public were consistently misled by the Foreign Office
about the government's policy on arms sales to Iraq, a former Foreign Office
official said yesterday.
Giving evidence to the Scott inquiry into defence sales to Iraq, Mr Mark
Higson, a former desk officer for Iraq at the Foreign Office, said that
before the end of 1988 the government started operating two different sets
of guidelines on arms sales to Iran and Iraq.
Foreign Office and trade ministers relaxed the strict guidelines towards
Iraq in order to win lucrative arms deals while insisting in public that the
guidelines were still being operated impartially.
'There would have been trouble from the public and MPs if we had announced
publicly that there had been a relaxation in favour of Iraq,' said Mr
Higson, who left the civil service, partly because of his disagreement with
the way that policy was being applied.
He said the sham policy was 'churned out' time and again for MPs and the
public, even on one occasion in a letter from Sir Geoffrey Howe, then
foreign secretary.
Mr Higson, who drafted the reply on the foreign secretary's behalf in June
1989, said the letter had not been a truthful answer to a query from Mr
Peter Shore, the Labour MP, because it did not reflect the policy being
applied at the time.
Miss Presiley Baxendale, counsel for Lord Justice Scott, said of the Howe
letter: 'It is misleading and not a truthful answer to Peter Shore's
letter?'
Mr Higson replied: 'Yes.'
His obligation had been 100 per cent to the Foreign Office, he said, and he
had maintained the sham policy regardless. 'It was my duty,' he said.
The government had considered Iraq 'the big prize' when the Iran-Iraq war
ended, he said. This was recognised by Mr William Waldegrave, then a junior
minister at the Foreign Office, in a note he wrote on a departmental memo in
October 1989.
He wrote: 'I doubt if there is any future market of such a scale anywhere
where the UK is potentially so well placed if we play our diplomatic hand
correctly . . . We must not allow it to go to the French, Germans, Japanese,
Koreans etc.'
In recommending that the foreign secretary visit Iraq at the earliest
opportunity, Mr Waldegrave added: 'A few more Bazofts and another bout of
internal repression will make things more difficult.'
The minister was referring to Mr Farzad Bazoft, an Observer newspaper
journalist who was executed after being arrested in Iraq on spying charges.

FT  16 JUL 93 / Lopez obtained GM papers before VW move, court told
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   HAMBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A GERMAN civil court was yesterday told that Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de
Arriortua, a General Motors executive who left for Volkswagen in March,
obtained a sheaf of about 100 documents from the US company shortly before
his departure.
It was one of several statements from witnesses and written affidavits which
contradicted claims and formal declarations from Mr Lopez, now VW's
production director. According to statements by Mr Lopez, both yesterday and
previously, he remembered asking for only four or five charts.
GM employees yesterday also contested Mr Lopez's reasons for wanting
translations into German of about 300 overhead projection slides relating to
GM's future purchasing policy. A statement read by his lawyer said Mr Lopez,
who was head of global purchasing at GM, needed German versions for
presentations to suppliers of components to Adam Opel, GM's German
subsidiary.
According to an affidavit from a GM employee he asked for the translations,
he wanted them because of possible difficulties with the VDA, the German
motor industry association, over his purchasing policy. Mr Lopez has a
confirmed reputation as a hard negotiator on prices.
'It was unusual because Mr Lopez was not very good at German,' the affidavit
said.
The hearing in Hamburg was related to an attempt by Der Spiegel, the weekly
news magazine, to remove a court gagging order imposed at VW's request. The
order was imposed following the publication of articles alleging that Mr
Lopez and colleagues systematically assembled company secrets while still
working for GM.
The reports also suggested that Mr Lopez, who abruptly joined VW in
mid-March, and colleagues who followed, took the secrets with them or sent
them in advance.
Imposing the gagging order, the court had ordered Der Spiegel to print
formal rebuttals by VW executives of most of its allegations.
It also emerged yesterday that the GM legal department asked for a search of
an office occupied by Mr Jose Gutierrez, a close associate of Mr Lopez,
while Mr Gutierrez was away on a business trip in Japan on GM's behalf. The
search, on March 17, two days after Mr Lopez quit, failed to uncover 'highly
confidential' documents on a new diesel engine, which Mr Gutierrez has
subsequently denied ever having.

FT  16 JUL 93 / Government plans wider access to information:
Whistle-blowers may be protected by 'harm tests'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOVES TO sweep away of some of the secrecy of government came a step closer
yesterday when Mr William Waldegrave, the public services minister,
announced plans to increase public access to information.
The plans include a code of practice, new statutory rights and the
introduction of 'harm tests' to prevent whistle-blowers being penalised for
revealing information that does no harm.
Unveiling a white paper which outlines proposals designed to bring greater
openness into Whitehall and other parts of the public sector, Mr Waldegrave
said that public access to information would be restricted only where there
were good reasons.
Despite continuing pressure from opposition MPs and campaigners, he was
unapologetic that the government had decided against a full freedom of
information act. He insisted his proposals were practical steps which met
the main aims of freedom of information legislation. They also maintained
parliamentary accountability rather than handing the issue over to the
courts.
'These proposals lay down a sure and lasting foundation for more open public
administration and government,' he said.
The proposals include a code of practice which would require Whitehall
departments to comply with reasonable requests for information. This could
extend to other organisations such as the National Health Service and local
authorities. The code would be policed by the parliamentary ombudsman.
There will be statutory rights to personal information and to health and
safety information.
There is unlikely to be time for government legislation in the coming
session of parliament, but a backbench MP could sponsor the measures in the
limited time available for this type of bill.
Maintaining the momentum behind the plans will be a critical test of Mr
Waldegrave's ability to sustain pressure on Whitehall. Some departments,
said to include the Treasury and the department of health, have resisted
aspects of the plans.
Tory MPs said the plans had gone beyond their expectations, but opposition
MPs and campaigners for greater freedom of information were more guarded in
their welcome.
Ms Marjorie Mowlam, the shadow public services minister, condemned the white
paper as fundamentally flawed because it left ministers to decide what
information should be made available. 'There are a lot of nice words, a lot
of good intentions, a lot of rhetoric but in the end there is a deep failure
to deliver open government,' she said.

FT  16 JUL 93 / The Lex Column: Rank Organisation
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It is always fun watching the stock market change its mind mid-way through a
trading session. Yesterday's reaction to Rank's interim results was a
classic example. The initial response to the company's accelerated dividend
payments and enhanced scrip alternative was that of a child in receipt of a
bag of sweets. But then it dawned that the change meant Rank, which is
mainly bought as a yield stock, would not make another pay-out for a year.
Such market volatility may only be temporary. Yet there are more substantial
concerns affecting Rank. The company takes a decidedly cautious view about
recovery. Indeed, the US appears to be growing stickier by the day.
Moreover, Rank is less operationally geared than many other leisure
businesses. Having sold its most cyclical assets, such as hotels, it will
not see a rapid upswing in demand. The differing effects of lower interest
rates on its 200m customers are an added complication. Youngsters with
higher income may dash out to the disco more often. But middle-aged couples
feeling the pinch are seeking better value summer holidays, while pensioners
with bulging building society accounts are indulging less on bingo. All this
suggests Rank's progress may be rather soggy. And, although Rank Xerox has
endured the recession well, its contribution to profits is unlikely to rise
rapidly either.
With net borrowings topping Pounds 1bn, Rank has limited scope for
acquisitive growth. If fully taken up, the enhanced scrip alternative may
ease the strain since it is in effect a mini-rights issue. But unless big
disposals are forthcoming, there is likely to be more excitement elsewhere
in the leisure sector.

FT  16 JUL 93 / The Lex Column: Welsh Water
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Welsh Water's triumph of hope over experience shows just why investors are
right to be cynical about diversification. Its foray into environmental
services came to nothing, while the stake in South Wales Electricity yielded
a profit but hardly a strategy. Hotels - a natural for a water company with
the vertical integration of en-suite bathroom plumbing into the sewerage
system - predictably ended in tears. Now there is the Acer engineering
services business, which was acquired for Pounds 49m in February, and after
further investigation apparently requires a Pounds 40.4m goodwill write-off.
The board confidently expects Acer to be earnings-enhancing this year. After
that kind of write-off, it would be surprising if it were anything else.
It is all such a contrast to the serenity of the main water business. Welsh
still has a strong balance sheet, though it may move into net debt this
year. Its capital expenditure requirements are lower than most and, while
that may lead Ofwat to impose a tough price cap, Welsh can easily absorb the
pain. Dividend cover is still high and while earnings will be under pressure
after the price review, there is no reason why Welsh cannot cut cover and
increase gearing to pay for dividend increases for many years. Given its
manifest destiny as a utility, one wonders why Welsh Water struggles so
vainly to become anything else.

<TEXT>
Since the franc got little practical help from yesterday's Bundesbank
meeting, speculators must be wondering whether they can force France out of
the ERM before the next council meeting. Things look finely balanced, with
the all-too evident souring of the French economy in marked contrast to
optimism about German prospects. Against that background, the interest rate
rises apparently required to support the franc simply do not look credible.
Yet all is not lost. The technical shortage of Euro francs limits the
speculators' ammunition, and enthusiasm over Germany looks premature. There
is also a shift in the markets' focus from short term interest rates as the
only prop for currencies and towards a view of good economic prospects as a
support. Doubtless the French wish to tread carefully, but they may yet have
to consider desperate remedies. A substantial cut in interest rates would
certainly call the speculators' bluff. And given the determination of both
French and German governments to hold the line, the franc might even stand
an outside chance of remaining within the system.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Lord Rothschild's psychic powers were at full stretch this week as St
James's Place Capital added to its holding of GUS voting shares just before
the vast majority of shares were enfranchised. While the terms of
compensation to the voting shares were perhaps a little disappointing, and
the share price response relatively muted, Lord Rothschild's main reward has
come in the outperformance of GUS's voting shares against non-voting equity
since the turn of the year. Indeed, that rise may be one reason why the
Wolfson Foundation finally acted on a suggestion which has been floating
around for a generation.
The Foundation may also have felt more able to let go of its security
blanket because the threat of a bid is now remote. The equalised voting and
non-voting shares seem to have settled out at around Pounds 19 in the
market, while the net worth is only Pounds 13.35 a share. With bids at a
25-year low, that is hardly likely to attract a predator. Yet the dilution
in Foundation votes from outright control to less than 2.5 per cent of the
equity certainly exposes the board to more institutional pressure. Companies
with substantial cash and strong cash flows get plenty of encouragement to
put the money to work. True, GUS's earnings and dividend record is enviable,
but the current yield is hardly generous, and piling the company's money
into gilts will hardly provide long-term growth.
Perhaps the spark will come from one of the new non-executive board
appointments. Lord Wolfson of Marylebone, the current chairman, may possibly
be considering retirement. Lord Wolfson of Sunningdale has done a sterling
job at Next, and is a possible replacement. Since these changes seem
designed to release value for shareholders, he may now consider disposal of
high value brands such as Burberry. Perhaps other parts such as mail order
will be floated off. The extra cash which property or financial services do
not need may even find its way back into shareholders' pockets.

FT  16 JUL 93 / Leading Article: Felipe's burden
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR FELIPE GONZALEZ may be about to discover the fact of contemporary
political life that has plagued Mr John Major over the past year: securing
re-election for your party is sometimes only the beginning of a prime
minister's problems. As he embarks on his fourth term, this time at the head
of a minority Socialist government, the economic and social challenges
facing the Spanish leader are greater than at any time in his 11 years in
power. The trouble is, the political base from which he intends to try to
confront them is as weak as it has ever been.
Personal triumph as it undoubtedly was, Mr Gonzalez's convincing election
victory last month could soon look a bit hollow. His new government is
weakened by the absence of the Catalan and Basque nationalist parties, which
he spent weeks trying to lure into coalition. They may not bring the new
administration down in the near future, but they may carp from the sidelines
if the economic medicine it forces on Spain is not to their liking.
More worrying is the composition of Mr Gonzalez's new ministerial team. To
be sure, he has won himself a relatively free hand by excluding from its
ranks the left-wing Socialist party ideologues who have impeded economic
reform in the past. He should be able to keep the parliamentary party in
check with the assistance of his most capable lieutenant, Mr Carlos
Solchaga, who has moved from the economy ministry to become chief Socialist
spokesman in parliament. But he still has to face down his opponents at a
full-scale party congress in a few months.
Mr Gonzalez has paid a price for securing a like-minded but colourless
cabinet. The economic team is composed of a party man and a technocrat -
respectively, Mr Narcis Serra and Mr Pedro Solbes - with no particularly
strong policy convictions. It is not clear that they have either the
instincts or the stomach to spearhead a programme of painful surgery and
radical reform.
The need for both is immediate. With recession curbing tax revenues and
sending unemployment - already the severest in the European Community - to
new heights of 22 per cent of the workforce and more, the public sector
budget deficit is spiralling out of control. Inflation, though currently on
the way down, is still higher than that of Spain's EC neighbours, and liable
to start rising again unless Mr Gonzalez can secure a wage restraint deal
with the trade unions and convince the currency markets that the peseta is
not still heavily overvalued. And renewed economic growth, which Spain needs
most of all to cut the dole queues, recedes further into the distance the
longer the government ploughs on with its dogged attempt to achieve economic
convergence with its EC partners.
The task of getting the public finances and the macro-economy on an even
keel, though, is just the beginning. If convergence is to bring Spain
sustainable, non-inflationary growth, it will have to be accompanied by
structural reforms more radical than anything Mr Gonzalez has yet seemed
ready to contemplate - especially in the labour market.
Unless he is prepared for the years of strain that this will place upon his
party and his country, he may yet have to consider an alternative course.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A STRANGER to UK shores might conclude that Britain was about to adopt a
Freedom of Information Act, so persuasive was Mr William Waldegrave
yesterday that his new white paper would bring open government. Mr
Waldegrave announced a further increase in the amount of official
information available to the public. And he proposed that the parliamentary
ombudsman should police Whitehall's performance in opening up access to
information.
True, the white paper proposes a lengthy list of exemptions from the
presumption of access to official information. This includes information
given in confidence, information on the effective management of the economy,
incomplete analysis and commercially sensitive information. As Mr Waldegrave
points out, however, even countries with freedom of information legislation
permit exemptions, often for categories not so very different from his.
Whether yesterday's white paper marks a step forward will depend on how
permissive government bodies are in deciding whether these exemptions apply
in particular cases.
Take, for example, the new right of access to health and safety information.
If that works well, it will remove at one stroke the biggest single cause of
complaint over government secrecy. It ought to mean that the transport
department publishes the data it collects on the pollution standards and
safety of new cars. But if this information is covered by the exemption on
third party commercial confidences, the complaints will not abate.
Similarly with the other significant new right in yesterday's white paper -
access to personal files. The most important part of personal records is
often observations from third parties which might be covered by the
exemption for information given in confidence. To be denied these would in
many cases render the right of access nugatory.
Decisions over the coverage of the exemptions will be policed by the
parliamentary commissioner, the ombudsman who investigates maladministration
in central government and the health service. There is much to commend in
this choice, since the ombudsman offers a cheaper and probably faster
appeals process than would the courts. His is also a well-established
office, with experience of scrutinising official papers and ruling on
complaints. Although he cannot force departments to comply with his
decisions, they are almost invariably accepted. He is accountable to
parliament through a Commons select committee, which ought to be
strengthened with a view to increasing his authority in his new
responsibilities.
The success, therefore, of the drive for greater openness will rest with the
ombudsman. If he takes a robust attitude in assessing the public interest
when considering appeals, then yesterday's white paper could mark a real
step forward in rolling back the secretive culture of Britain's public
administration. Until the practical workings of these procedures can be
judged, there will be widespread scepticism about Mr Waldegrave's reforms.
At present, access to UK government information is often easier in Brussels,
Washington or even Moscow than in London.

FT  16 JUL 93 / House of the rising reformers: Japan's election will
transform the political landscape
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER and ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Japan will emerge from this weekend's general election with conservatives in
a stronger position than perhaps at any time since the end of the second
world war.
That the resurgence and modernisation of Japan's conservative politics will
be the main outcome of the election may seem paradoxical. After all, the
turmoil was set off a month ago by a split in the ruling Liberal Democratic
party which now threatens its 38-year grip on power.
The June 18 defection of more than 50 LDP members of the parliament's lower
house led to the Miyazawa government's defeat in a no-confidence vote and
the formation of three conservative parties which will contest the election
on Sunday.
Large-scale opinion polls conducted over the past few days and the Tokyo
metropolitan council elections two weeks ago have suggested the likely
outcome.
The main casualty could be the socialist opposition, the Social Democratic
party. The anti-LDP protest votes which have usually gone to the socialists
are likely to go to the new conservative parties, the Japan New party, the
Japan Renewal party and the New Harbinger party. They hope to be especially
popular among younger, independent, urban voters with their concentration on
political reform and consumer-oriented policies.
The LDP is not facing an electoral catastrophe. It is unlikely to win an
overall majority, yet it is almost certain to emerge as the largest party
after the election, which will bring to a close the first act of a political
drama that could run for weeks, if not months.
The days after the election will probably be dominated by hectic and
confusing negotiations over the formation of a coalition government, with
black cars ferrying politicians in shiny suits between Tokyo hotels. During
this transition period, the traditional ingredients of Japanese politics
will come to the fore, as party leaders horse trade over positions and
patronage rather than debate policies and principles.
There is likely to be a second election soon after the first under revised
electoral laws. Reform of Japan's corruption-riddled electoral system has
been the only national issue in the campaign, and will be the new
government's first priority.
However, amid the confusion and instability of the next few months, two
issues will determine whether changes will be lasting. Are the new
conservative parties just a fad, or a third force which could rewrite the
character of Japanese politics?
Will the upheaval lead to different policies being pursued by the future
Japanese government? In particular, will the Japanese political script be
rewritten by younger leaders who want the country to play a larger, more
assertive and independent role in world affairs?
The election will be the first step to answering these questions. There are
four possible outcomes:
The least likely is an outright LDP victory. It is defending 227 seats and
needs a further 30 to win an overall majority in the 511-strong lower house
of parliament. Yet the strength of the LDP's local organisation means it is
likely to maintain its core support. A coalition government between the SDP,
smaller centrist parties such as the Komeito, the clean government party,
and the conservative Japan Renewal party is a marginally more probable
outcome.
Such a coalition may not, however, get the numbers. Opinion polls suggest
the SDP could lose between 40 and 70 of its 140 seats. In the Tokyo local
elections it lost half its seats. The Japan Renewal party, led by Mr Tsutomu
Hata, the former LDP finance minister, is fielding only 69 candidates and
may win 40-50 seats, and the Komeito is expected to retain its 46 seats.
Even if the opposition drew the Japan New party into the coalition, to give
it a majority, it would be sharply divided over policies and personalities.
The SDP adheres to a foreign policy which predates the end of the cold war
and is at odds with the new conservatives. Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the JNP
leader, is a bitter rival of Mr Ichiro Ozawa, once the power behind the LDP
throne, who is playing the same role in the Renewal party.
Much more likely is a coalition led by the LDP if, as expected, it wins
between 210 and 230 seats, with the Japan New party and the New Harbinger
party (which plan to merge after the election), if they win about 50 seats
between them.
Such a coalition might provide the catalyst for the LDP's renewal and
revival. The election may pave the way for younger, more reformist leaders
to take over the helm at the LDP. Senior LDP officials believe that, with
the JNP's help, the party could weather the worst of the storm by helping to
give it a reformist image as a precursor to resuming its role in later
elections as the natural party of government.
Shrewd political observers in Japan's bureaucracy believe the JNP's appeal
could prove shortlived. Its policies are vague. It is largely a vehicle for
the ambitions of its leader, the aristocratic Mr Hosokawa. He might be drawn
into the LDP fold by the promise of a job such as foreign minister.
As likely as an LDP-led coalition is further fragmentation which could
prolong instability. Mr Ozawa believes the opposition parties will have the
numbers to threaten a no-confidence motion at any time even if they cannot
form a government. He foresees further defections of young reformers from
the LDP and a split in the SDP after an electoral setback which would force
it to revise its policies, a development which a hardline minority might
find hard to stomach.
Whatever the precise standings of the parties and the details of their plans
for political reform, this election is part of a fundamental process which
is reshaping Japanese politics. It will not end this weekend. The centre of
gravity of the entire political system is shifting, in a belated response to
the economic and social changes which have swept Japan as it has become
perhaps the strongest economy in the post-cold-war world.
The old dividing line between left and right is increasingly irrelevant. For
the foreseeable future the most important divide in Japanese politics, which
will cut across the main parties, will be between modernisers and
traditionalists.
This new divide has several components. There is a growing generational rift
between the young and the old, and also between the cosmopolitan, urban
middle class and the provincial working class.
Supporters of political reform are spread through all parties. Elderly
defenders of the status quo congregate in both the LDP and the SDP.
Reformers in different parties often have more in common with one another
than with their seniors within their own party. The believers in Japan's old
foreign policies - the right's adherence to US leadership and the left's
pacifist opposition to it - are at odds with the young realists in all
parties who want Japan to play a more assertive, independent world role,
symbolised by their enthusiasm to dispatch Japanese troops to serve abroad
in United Nations peacekeeping operations.
The rise of the new conservative parties to challenge both the established
LDP and the SDP could be the vehicle for transmitting the conflict between
modernisers and traditionalists into the political arena. Across the
political system the balance of power is swinging in favour of modernisers,
whether they are young LDP politicians who want to appeal to voters with
consumer-oriented policies or their socialist peers who want to ditch old
policies, such as support for communist North Korea.
The divide between young and old will be enduring and could provide fertile
soil in which the new conservative parties will take root. It is reflected
in the business community, which finances politics, between domestically
oriented construction companies and small retailers, on the one hand, and
international manufacturing and financial companies on the other.
The stronger the performance of the established parties, the LDP and the
SDP, the slower will be the pace of modernisation. The stronger the
performance of the new parties, the quicker will be pace of change. In large
part this is because the success of the new parties will force the older
parties to respond by adopting the reformist policies advocated by their
younger members. The election will allow the young modernisers who will lead
Japan into the next century their loudest shout yet. It is unlikely to be
their last.

Whatever the outcome of the legal battle shaping up in Germany between
General Motors and Volkswagen over the defection of executives to VW, it's
unlikely to damage the reputation of one of GM's brightest stars,
50-year-old Harry Pearce.
Pearce heads GM's legal department and he likes nothing better than a good
fight. He won his first GM battle honours back in February when he took on
the NBC television network. In a masterly two-hour press conference, he
produced compelling evidence that NBC had rigged a fiery crash of a GM truck
and he eventually won a public apology from the network. Now he's been
handed another juicy legal battle where he can once again show his mettle.
How other corporate lawyers must envy him.
But Pearce is much more than GM's top lawyer. Last November, when a palace
revolution shook up GM's top management, Pearce was the surprise choice to
become executive vice-president responsible for the group's two
non-automotive operations - Electronic Data Systems and GM Hughes
Electronics - both very large businesses in their own right.
His elevation underlines the more open, creative approach to management
ushered in by November's upheaval. For, while GM's top executives tend to be
long-time company employees, many of whom have worked their way up on the
finance side of the business, Pearce is an attorney and only joined the
group in 1985.
Before that, he was working in obscurity as a trial lawyer based in one of
America's most rural states, North Dakota, where he grew up. On one
occasion, he so unnerved a witness that the man began eating his tie.

Indeed, according to a new EC survey, more of his fellow citizens are aware
that he is the present occupant of 10 Downing Street than know where 10
Downing Street is. The 98 per cent naming Major as prime minister compared
with 94 per cent able to identify London as their country's capital.
His only two European counterparts better known to their electorates were
Germany's Helmut Kohl and Spain's Felipe Gonzalez at 99 per cent apiece. The
obscurity prize went to Edouard Balladur of France with a dismal 80 per
cent.

FT  16 JUL 93 / Personal View: A big dimension to the small screen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVEN BARNETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Forecasting the success of new media has not been a conspicuous success.
Kenneth Baker is still remembered as the technology minister who, in 1982,
predicted that multi-channel cable television would be in every British home
by the end of the 1980s.
Even when cable failed to materialise, the optimists were undaunted: the
launch of direct-to-home satellite (DTH) television in 1989 saw forecasts of
8m dish households by the middle of the 1990s. The year of take-off was to
be 1993. Instead, the first few months have been among the worst for dish
sales since satellite TV started.
With satellite's share of viewing hovering at about 5-6 per cent of the
total, it now seems that satellite channels are unlikely to challenge the
mainstream terrestrial broadcasters, and will remain at the margins of most
people's viewing behaviour. This is not so much a verdict on the nature of
these channels as a statement about the need for more television. Increasing
the number of channels has made very little difference to the amount people
watch, and the principle of paying for television beyond a licence fee is
still an alien concept to a country brought up on 'free' consumption. As the
disappointing take-up for Premier League soccer on Sky Sports has shown,
most households will not pay even for programmes they watched when there was
no subscription fee.
Given Kenneth Baker's embarrassing pronouncements 10 years ago, it might
therefore seem foolish to start predicting a big expansion for cable.
But cable is different because it offers enormous potential beyond the
simple addition of more TV channels. Even now fibre-optic technology allows
cable subscribers to shop or bank from home, to choose coverage of a soccer
match from four different channels or to participate in quiz shows. The
interactive capacity of cable offers a dimension to the small screen more in
tune with the new generation of domestic technology than old-fashioned
notions of passive TV viewing.
Cable has two further advantages which a survey commissioned by the Henley
Centre suggests will be vital selling points. First is the opportunity to
offer cheaper telephony than the existing BT or Mercury tariffs. When
non-cable or satellite subscribers were asked whether they would subscribe
to cable if it offered cheaper telephone bills, 24 per cent said they would
be very or fairly likely to. This contrasts with the 9 per cent who said
they were very or fairly likely to get satellite television in the next
year.
Cable's second advantage - potentially the most powerful, and so far the
least exploited - is the facility for making local TV programmes, aimed at
communities of much smaller size than ITV regions. For largely historical
reasons local television has never featured in Britain, but when this option
was put to non-cable or satellite subscribers in the survey 31 per cent said
they would be likely to subscribe to cable if it offered local programmes.
The attraction of cable presupposes the ability and willingness of cable
companies to exploit fibre-optic technology in a way that will maximise
consumer interest. Some have already started to switch their emphasis from
television to telephony and are reaping the benefits.
It means investing money in local entertainment, information and current
affairs programmes. It also means persuading other organisations, businesses
and agencies to participate in the electronic revolution. Home shopping is
only possible if the local branch of Sainsbury or Marks and Spencer is
prepared to offer and respond to screen-based shopping lists. Local
information benefits are only realisable if local authorities use the
opportunity to convey the kinds of information which local citizens require.
Assuming cable companies can harness these advantages, it seems that a
genuine demand exists for something different from and more sophisticated
than traditional TV.
Satellite's technological limitations will, within five years, make the dish
an anachronism, and our own forecasts suggest that by the end of 1998 cable
penetration will have overtaken satellite.
It is a new dimension to the TV screen which will transform the living room
in much the same way that computers and IT have transformed the office.
The author is editor of Media Futures, a new study on the changing
communications environment from the Henley Centre, to be published next week

FT  16 JUL 93 / Leading Article: Private data
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE same week that the British government admitted that too much public
information was being kept secret, Mr Eric Howe, the data protection
registrar, said new laws might be needed to stamp out a black market in
personal information.
Mr Howe pointed to evidence that private investigators were tricking or
bribing employees of financial institutions and utilities to reveal
information about their customers, which is then mainly sold to
debt-collection agencies or lawyers in messy divorce cases.
Mr Howe also questioned the practice among financial institutions of
swapping information about their customers via credit reference agencies. He
is worried that some banks have made it a condition of providing loans or
opening accounts that customers agree to information being passed on in this
way - a concern also raised yesterday by Sir Bryan Carsberg,
director-general of fair trading.
While bribing employees to reveal confidential information is clearly
intolerable, that does not mean new laws are needed. Under the Data
Protection Act, it is already an offence for a company to disclose
computerised personal data knowingly to anybody it has not identified for
this purpose in the data protection registry.
The snag is that companies often circumvent the spirit of this rule by
describing those to whom they might transfer data in broad categories - such
as anybody who makes inquiries. Before considering new laws, it would be
better to put pressure on financial institutions and utilities to use
narrower descriptions, so making clear they will only reveal information
where they have customers' express permission.
Similarly, although swapping information about customers obviously helps
financial institutions cut down bad debts, that is not a sufficient reason
to breach confidentiality. Under their code of practice, banks are
theoretically committed not to disclose data unless customers give consent.
But requiring consent as a condition of trade makes a mockery of the code.
Mr Howe already has powers to stop the practice by declaring it contrary to
the Data Protection Act's provisions that information should be collected
fairly. He should use them.

FT  16 JUL 93 / Letter: Paradox of Ukraine and membership of the nuclear
club
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr OLEH A SZMELSKYJ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Monday's Financial Times presented an interesting paradox. Your
article, 'Regional jostling ties up Yeltsin assembly', and your editorial,
'Mr Yeltsin's dwindling power', highlight the likelihood of the political
disintegration of the Russian Federation into a myriad of small and
presumably nuclear-armed states. Yet on the other hand Ian Davidson's
article, 'No nukes is good nukes', is critical of Ukraine (by comparison a
politically stable state) and its possible unwillingness to give away its
nuclear weapons (and their uranium which can be used as energy) to Russia.
Ian Davidson argues that nuclear weapons should belong to legitimate members
of the nuclear club. Who are these legitimate members? China, France,
Britain, the US and the USSR. However, the latter has been replaced by 15
(11 excluding the Baltics) equal successor states, four of which - Belarus,
Kazhakstan, Ukraine and Russia - have nuclear weapons as part of their
inheritance. The fact that 176 Soviet inter-continental ballistic missiles
were deliberately stationed in the Ukrainian portion of the Soviet Union and
did not 'happen' to be there by chance, as Mr Davidson implies, would not
have prevented Ukraine being a legitimate target had deterrence failed and
MAD (mutually assured destruction) ensued.
However, to end on an optimistic if not realistic note: assuming the US and
Russia were to guarantee Ukraine's security and at the same time that of
China, France and Britain, then presumably, using the same logic as is used
with respect to Ukraine, these three states would divest themselves of
nuclear weapons. Or is this just naive Ukrainian wishful thinking?

FT  16 JUL 93 / Letter: The training anomaly that puts nanny at a
disadvantage
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Ms VICTORIA TOMLINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, As an employer committed to training, I train my employees in my
business and believe that a nanny employed at home should be given the same
support and training as any 'business' employee.
Training has been given a high profile by government and industry in the UK.
The government is supposedly supporting a national target designed to ensure
that, by 1996, all employees take part in training or development
activities. You would think, therefore, there would be some support for
individuals training employees.
I rang the tax office to ask if our nanny's course fees - she has registered
for a six-year part-time degree course in subjects relevant to her job -
would be an allowable expense against my personal tax.
The response - a snort and 'this is a new one on me' - perhaps said it all.
It seems that not only do businesswomen have to pay for childcare out of
taxed income - even though I could not run my business without this back-up
 -but the government does not even support those who carry out the training
philosophy for every employee.
The final word comes from the tax office. No, they said, a nanny cannot
claim personal tax relief if she pays the course fees herself - even though
the course is relevant to her job. According to the tax office this is
because it is increasing her marketability and career chances. It would be
interesting to hear their views on what they think business training across
the country does for the individuals.

FT  16 JUL 93 / Letter: Private sector cannot support state pensions if tax
incentives cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ROGER WESTWOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Readers of Barry Riley's Long View (July 10/11) could be forgiven for
concluding that the expressions of concern from within the pensions movement
following the spring Budget simply represent the special pleading of a
handful of rich members of large pension schemes.
This is not so. Our concern is this. The government is sending very clear
signals that the whole working population should look far more to arranging
its long-term retirement savings through occupational or personal provision,
rather than through the state. Yet the spring Budget dealt a hefty blow to
confidence that there will be a tax regime which encourages long-term
saving, as opposed to short or medium-term consumption.
The government announced on March 16, without any consultation, that with
effect from April 6 it would be divesting Pounds 600m from individuals'
savings for retirement into its own coffers (that is in effect what the
Budget reduction in pension funds' tax credits did). This cannot be
perceived as encouraging employers to sponsor occupational pension schemes
or individuals to make personal provision. All the less so when the tax
credit is uncoupled from the rate of Advance Corporation Tax, raising fears
of a special tax on pension funds' investment income, involving further
transfers from individuals' savings to the Treasury.
The freezing of the earnings cap adds to the long-term problems which the
cap will in any case bring. The cap only affects highly paid individuals
but, because it is linked to prices which rise more slowly than earnings
upon which many individuals' pensions are based, it will, over time, bite
ever lower down the earnings scale. This means that the longer one has to
save to retirement the more likely it is that one will find oneself
penalised by the cap, with the added possibility now that the government
will accelerate the process by freezing the cap.
Again, hardly an incentive to long-term retirement saving.
In our contacts with the Treasury we have emphasised that, if private
retirement saving is to shoulder some of the burden now carried by the
state, the current relatively modest tax incentives for such long-term
savings need to be maintained.
Equally important, to foster the confidence needed to save for tomorrow what
one could consume today, the government needs to give a clear statement that
the incentives will be maintained.

FT  16 JUL 93 / Letter: Age-related national insurance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr MALCOLM T BALLISAT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your editorial 'Second best pensions' (June 30) highlights the cost
implications of an ageing population.
The comments on defined contribution schemes are correct but incomplete.
It is possible to change the investments towards retirement, for example, to
move from equity-based investments to gilts and index-linked stock so as to
match the changes in annuity rates.
Action needs to be taken over the high commission rates paid on personal
pensions and it is disappointing that the latest proposals on investor
protection appear to be against the disclosure of commissions.
An important point that needs addressing is how to ensure that those in
employment do save for retirement. Younger employees do not believe they
will ever retire and have more immediate calls on their income.
One approach would be for age-related National Insurance contribution rates
to be introduced and the reduction made to younger employees to become a
mandatory savings scheme.

FT  16 JUL 93 / Two of a Kind: Glaring gap between idea and reality -
Central bankers who are sceptical about deeper European Union
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Pierre Jaans, director-general of the Luxembourg Monetary Institute, is a
quizzical-looking intellectual who handles the Grand Duchy's monetary
affairs from a fourth-floor office near the main railway station.
Prosperous Luxembourg - currently the sole EC member with a good enough
economic performance to meet the Maastricht criteria for economic and
monetary union - is normally regarded as a true believer in Euro-federalism.
Mr Jaans, however, is a heretic. Asked whether the EC should deepen its
co-operation towards greater pooling of political and economic power, or
widen it to include new members, Mr Jaans replies crisply: 'Deepening is
over. Nobody wants it.'
Of crucial importance, he says, is how the Community treats the former east
bloc countries seeking membership. 'I cannot really imagine a consensus
coming about in favour of staying with 12 members, making the Community
first a kind of federal state of these 12, and then letting the others come
in later on their knees.'
Whatever the EC's future course, Luxembourg's past record has been
impressively integrationist. It has its own monetary union with Belgium
under an agreement dating back to 1922.
Although Mr Jaans has been for 16 years Luxembourg's representative on the
EC committee of central bank governors, his institute is not, properly
defined, a central bank. Its powers of monetary creation are limited to
responsibility for issuing Luxembourg franc coins and banknotes. Interest
rates are set by the National Bank of Belgium, which, Mr Jaans says
succinctly, 'tells rather than consults' him about its decisions.
Mr Jaans himself is a model Euro-citizen. Born in Luxembourg 57 years ago,
he studied economics in Berlin, Paris and Munich, and worked for 10 years
(between 1962 and 1972) in the research department of the German Bundesbank.
Mr Jaans's wife is German, and he says he appreciates the 'very tolerant and
generous' nature of German society. Although he highlights Luxembourg's
history of 'economic or military occupation' by its large German neighbour,
he is not concerned by the thought that Europe will fall under domination of
reunited Germany.
What worries Mr Jaans is the Maastricht treaty. He is all too aware of the
gap between the desirability of great-er European co-operation and its
feasibility, criticising the treaty for being unclear about how Emu can be
ach-ieved. If Luxembourg had held a referendum on Maastricht, he probably
would not have voted for it.
His chief complaint is that politicians will have too much leeway in
deciding how the treaty will be interpreted and implemented. 'It sets up
structures which can be shelved or mobilised at the choice of a handful of
people.'
As far as Luxembourg is concerned, this will damage what he regards as a
highly beneficial feature of his country's democracy: 'the really admirable
proximity of individual citizens to the political process'.
His long-held responsibility for Luxembourg banking supervision - he was
banking commissioner before taking over at the Monetary Institute - gives Mr
Jaans a wry perspective on past Emu plans. The most celebrated was drawn up
by Mr Pierre Werner, the former Luxembourg prime minister, who in 1970
formulated a timetable (quickly shelved) for European monetary union by
1980.
Mr Jaans recalls that Luxembourg's growth as a financial centre during the
1970s was spurred by German measures to keep out inflows of speculative
funds into the D-Mark, which drove the money to the Grand Duchy instead.
Hence his conclusion: 'If Pierre Werner's plan had come about, we would have
had no financial centre in Luxembourg.'
As befits a man who once worked at the Bundesbank, Mr Jaans shares the
German central bank's view that the timetable set down for Emu in Maastricht
is 'very ambitious . . . The time horizon for monetary union in 1997 is not
really realistic. It's difficult to say whether this will be the case for
1999.'
However, unlike the Bundesbank - which pleads that a low inflation rate is a
condition for faster growth - Mr Jaans thinks that commitment to stable
money can have a contractionary effect on the economy. 'If you opt for a
hard currency model, the price you pay is somewhat lower growth. If you
really have stability of the currency as your first priority, this brings
with it limitations.'
This controversial thesis is an important reason for Mr Jaans's belief that
a monetary union involving all 12 EC members will never be feasible. 'I feel
this group (the 12) is not homogeneous enough politically. They are
countries with such different priorities.'
Mr Jaans says the aim of setting up Emu on a D-Mark-orientated hard currency
basis 'may suit countries such as Germany, the Benelux countries, Denmark
and perhaps France, with high prosperity and reasonably well-spread
financial wealth'. Less well-off countries would rather give priority to
growth, he says, and will not want to join in.
Could not the more prosperous countries proceed to monetary union on their
own? 'Technically and economically', Mr Jaans says, this would present no
obstacles, but he believes there is little political will for such a step.
Moving to a single currency with a single central bank for a limited group
of EC countries would be like 'building a political cathedral. It may be
nice as a political monument, but you are not gaining significant additional
benefits.' Mr Jaans clearly thinks Europe's single currency will take quite
a while to arrive.

FT  16 JUL 93 / Two of a Kind: Something agnostic in the state of Denmark -
Central bankers who are sceptical about deeper European Union
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Erik Hoff-meyer, the 68-year-old governor of the Danish National Bank, is
the grand old sceptic of European central banking. In office since 1965, Mr
Hoffmeyer has enjoyed a close-up view of three decades of monetary
turbulence. He has witnessed the virtues of European integration - and its
limits.
From the National Bank's bunker-like building in Copenhagen, he delivers a
blunt judgment on the Maastricht plan for economic and monetary union. 'Ever
since Maastricht was signed, the awkward thing has been that we have been
discussing things which will probably never materialise.' Mr Hoffmeyer
believes Germany, ostensibly a driving force behind European monetary union,
does not really want it. 'If there was a referendum (in Germany) Emu would
probably be defeated.'
The Danish krone this week has been caught up in the latest currency
turbulence centred on the French franc. Asked about the dilemma faced by
France - whether to wait for the long-term rewards of stability against the
D-Mark, or to submit to foreign exchange market pressures - Mr Hoffmeyer
says obliquely: 'It's a question of patience.'
He points to the 'rather strict' Maastricht limits on public debts and
deficits which will determine which EC members can participate in Emu. 'The
convergence criteria are obviously of German origin, and I can imagine the
Germans had an idea of how difficult it would be to fulfil them.'
Mr Hoffmeyer, a sagacious, soft-spoken man, is one of the best-known
representatives of a small EC state which, by rejecting the treaty in June
1992, erected the first roadblock on the EC's path to union. The Danes
ratified Maastricht in a second referendum in May, but only after gaining
exemptions for the country from most aspects of the treaty, including Emu.
Mr Hoffmeyer has a reputation for outspokenness. In the early 1980s, he
warned that Denmark was 'sliding into the abyss' because of high public debt
and inflation. In May, he complained that European currency co-operation had
'collapsed' because of competitive ERM devaluations.
Mr Hoffmeyer admits there is much he does not understand about economies'
behaviour and financial markets. He confesses he has mixed feelings about
Maastricht.
Before the 1992 referendum, Mr Hoffmeyer says he argued in favour of the
treaty. A seat on the board of the proposed European central bank, he says,
would have given the Danes greater leverage over European monetary
policymaking, at present dominated by the German Bundesbank. 'Inside, we
would have some influence. If you look at it logically, it's better to be
inside than outside.'
On the other hand, Mr Hoffmeyer doubts that Europe should pool
decision-making in areas which are the fundamental preserve of national
policy. 'We are moving too close to areas which have an effect on national
identity. If we didn't have European union, it would not be a catastrophe.
The essential aims are to prevent war between countries and to continue
economic and political integration. You can do that without union.'
Mr Hoffmeyer's views have been influenced by living with a large, powerful
southern neighbour. Alone among foreign central bank chiefs, he has known
all past presidents of the Bundesbank. A teenager during the German wartime
invasion of Denmark, he fled to Sweden, and forged links with the
resistance.
At the Bundesbank's Frankfurt headquarters, Mr Hoffmeyer still ranks as a
resistance fighter. After publishing a scholarly book last year on monetary
history, Mr Hoffmeyer was chided by some Bundesbank officials for
highlighting a German desire to flex political muscle in currency squalls.
Mr Hoffmeyer admits his own central bank's muscles are rather weak. Under
its 1936 statutes, the Danish National Bank is independent from the
government. However, the National Bank's basic monetary stance, like that of
other ERM central banks, is largely set by the Bundesbank.
This follows almost inevitably, he says, from Germany's economic strength.
'The more integrated you are, the more dependent you are. Even during the
period when we were more dependent on the dollar, I had the feeling that we
mostly depended on Germany. I had no difficulties over that.'
Mr Hoffmeyer - who retires at the end of 1994 at 70 - says he has become
progressively more wedded to German-style anti-inflation policy. 'During the
1970s, my views changed. Inflation acts like a dissolvent on society. This
became apparent in Denmark in the late 1970s. There was an uncomfortable
feeling of instability.'
Implementation of anti-inflation policies has less to do with dogma than
with public opinion, Mr Hoffmeyer says. In the German-orientated ERM 'core'
countries - including Denmark - electorates have been willing to sacrifice
employment in return for more price stability.
'Over the time I have been at the National Bank, we have moved from full
employment to more than 10 per cent unemployment, and from inflation of 15
to 17 per cent to a level of 1 1/2 per cent. I cannot say whether price
stability is the prime condition for growth. But it has proved impossible
simultaneously to fulfil the two objectives of price stability and high
employment.
'People now seem to prefer price stability to full employment. The choice
has been made not by the politicians but by the people.' In view of economic
contraction in his country and many of its EC partners, the agnostic Mr
Hoffmeyer leaves open the possibility that, one day, priorities could shift
again.

FT  16 JUL 93 / Arts: Chinese puzzles / Review of 'Silent Energy' at Oxford
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LYNN MACRITCHIE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Since the mid-19th century, a vital strand in China's development has been
its changing self-definition in relation to the west. Now that many Chinese
artists are living in cities such as Paris or New York, some in exile since
the Tiananmen Square events of 1989, this process continues, but with a new
dimension.
The work produced by those trained in China's art colleges since their
reopening in the late 1970s has developed for the first time within a
sustained climate of western influence. There has been time for a whole
generation to assimilate western forms of expression much more thoroughly
than in the past. Or, in the words of Huang Yongping, one of the eight
artists showing specially commissioned works in Silent Energy, a two-part
show at the Museum of Modern Art, Oxford, 'I took five years to study art
and I will need 10 years to forget what I learned.'
Huang was born in Xiamen in 1954, graduated from the Zhejiang Academy of
Fine Arts in 1982 and has lived in Paris since 1989. While at art college,
he was made to copy French 19th-century paintings. In protest, he collaged
the faces of peasants on to his copies. After graduation, he founded the
Xiamen Dada group in 1986, its anti-academic stance just as necessary to the
artists of 1980s China as it had been to those of Europe 60 years before.
At Oxford, Huang is showing a work which at first sight seems an average
example of the 1990s school of large-scale installation. A tent-like
structure fills the lower gallery, its form minimal, its frame of reference
apparently simple - nomadism and museum culture, perhaps, or transient
versus monumental. Stepping within, however, things begin to get
complicated. The plain cream canvas is lined with yellow silk, a colour
which in ancient China could only be worn by the emperor, signifying his
power and status. At first, the yellow hued space seems empty, lit only by a
naked bulb. Then a faint scratching sound draws the eye upwards. There,
imprisoned behind a glass ceiling, creep literally hundreds of locusts.
Amongst their scuttling shapes lurk even more sinister shadows - scorpions,
trapped with their prey. The piece, Huang explains, is called 'Yellow Peril'
and was inspired by a German cartoon of that name of the 1890s, which
personified western fears of the people of the east. Such fears, of course,
mirrored those of the Han Chinese themselves, who dreaded encroachment from
the Mongol hordes, and built the Great Wall to keep them at bay. The Chinese
characters for yellow and for locusts have the same pronunciation, which
also sounds like the artist's name, Huang. Chinese characters can have
several different meanings, distinguished only by their pronunciation, a
constant source of jokes which delight the Chinese and mystify outsiders.
Thus this familiar seeming piece in the western installation genre, complete
with nod to Damien Hirst, requires a knowledge of Chinese history, language
and culture to grasp the full range of its meaning.
The same is true of the work of Cai Guoqiang who makes drawings using
gunpowder and Chen Zhen, who have constructed a piece called 'Terraced
Field' from burned books. To a Chinese eye, the charred volumes convey not
just the musings on cultural decay and political oppression which might
occur to western minds but also the concept of transformation through
process, immolation as fertility rite.
Gu Wenda, now resident in New York, sprinkles placenta powder, an ingredient
in traditional Chinese medicine, over five empty cots in his piece 'Oedipus
Refound II'. He also shows four scrolls, whose cut up calligraphy scrolled
over with fake characters in red paint, upset the Chinese authorities so
much that they closed down the 1986 exhibition in which the piece was shown
originally. His neighbour in the upper gallery, Yang Jie Chang, soaks rice
paper in calligraphic ink, using the sodden paper to construct rectangular
shapes on plain white supports whose size is determined by the site where
they will be shown. The dense black shapes recall Rothko, but were produced
after months of study with Taoist and Buddhist masters. It is worth
remembering that, at the time when western artists were becoming influenced
by such eastern modes of thought, the communist regime in China began its
campaign to expunge all traces of their existence from the country.
Wang Luyan is the only exhibiting artist who still lives in Beijing, where
he works as a graphic designer for a national newspaper. His piece, untitled
and drawn directly on the gallery wall with red and black marker pens, shows
a strange construction of pulleys and saws on to whose jagged teeth sag
bulbous shapes suggestive of human body parts. There seems little ambiguity
here, little need for clever references, in this pictorial metaphor for the
lived experience of an arbitrary and terrifying structure capable in the end
only of destroying its children. Goya, anyone?

FT  16 JUL 93 / Arts: Scotch a la Kirov - Ballet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On Wednesday night the Kirov Ballet presented something which announced
itself 'A Gala Programme'. In the event, two promised items - Jerome
Robbins' In the Night and Balanchine's Tchaikovsky pas de deux - did not
materialise, and were replaced by quaintnesses which had the debilitating
effect of a diet of macaroons. One major piece, though, was on view:
Balanchine's Scotch Symphony, and Kirov style redeemed some (if not all) of
the rest of the programme.
The evening was, indeed, an occasion to savour manner rather then matter, to
see how the aristocracy of St Petersburg training can rescue the ghastliest
nonsense. The Fairy Doll is an insupportable bit of sugared whimsy:
diabetics should not even be in the same theatre as this antique bonbon,
which dates from 1903. It involves a terminally cute danseuse, in Cartland
pink, being courted with maximum roguishness by two clowns. Hell gapes. Yet
even the men's noxious capers are illuminated by distinction of technique:
their education wins through. I can offer no bouquets to the sextet from La
Esmeralda, which must be wholly confusing to an audience not told that the
heroine is dancing for the man she loves at his betrothal party. It needs
more stylish performance than it received on Wednesday: in past seasons
Yevteyeva and Asylmuratova were wonderful because they made us believe in
its drama as in its predictable steps. On this occasion it seemed merely
lugubrious.
The sextet from La Vivandiere is a pretty thing, a reconstruction by Pierre
Lacotte from St. Leon's own notation of his 1844 triumph. (The cast sheet,
as usual, provided so little information for the public as to be almost
useless.) It was prettily danced by Irina Sitnikova and her companions, who
merit both names on the cast list and flowers. About the novelty of the
evening, an adagio act of lambent vulgarity by Oleg Vinogradov, I record
that it involved Yulia Makhalina and Konstantin Zaklinsky, that the
orchestra played Samuel Barber, and that Zaklinsky, who merits better,
lugged and twisted Makhalina in approved Bejartian struggle-fashion. She
might have been his Muse; she looked more like his luggage.
All of these matters seemed more foolish since the evening had begun with
the choreographic felicities of Scotch Symphony, led by the entrancing
Larissa Lezhnina. We see Balanchine somewhat Kirov-ised - broader, gentler
phrasing; rhythms and energies less acute than in New York - but it is
Balanchine nonetheless, and most touchingly so in the work of Lezhnina and
the female corps. Lezhnina's virtues (the lightness and sweetness of her
manner; the rectitude of every step) are an abiding joy. So, too, her sense
of the ballet's implicit homage to Romantic ballet's traditions: Taglioni's
heroine is just below the surface of her tender portrayal. I wish, though,
she had been given a partner more credible than Alexander Kurkov, whose
optimistic performance I did not appreciate.
The evening ended with the last act of The Nutcracker in Vasily Vainonen's
1934 version. It is very much of its time, and interest now lies only in the
grand pas de deux with its lifts in which the ballerina is thrown between
her cavaliers - a reminder of Soviet ballet's acrobatic tendencies in the
1930s. We have memorably seen Irina Kolpakova like purest crystal in this
scene. On Wednesday Veronika Ivanova was radiant, showing that dignity which
is the hall-mark of Kirov style. The closing moments of the Sugar-plum
variation, as Ivanova rounded out the last musical phrase with an exquisite
placing of her arm, made one forget every numbing moment of the
divertissements. Here was noble dancing. To Ivanova, and to Lezhnina,
gratitude: they told us why the Kirov is still the repository of classic
style.
The Kirov Ballet season continues at the Coliseum, with mixed repertory,
until July 31

FT  16 JUL 93 / Arts: Blake and Casken - Cheltenham Festival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLEMENTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cheltenham this year offers no less than 11 premieres, from the first
performance of Michael Berkeley's opera Baa Baa Black Sheep (on which I
reported last week) to the emergence of Alan Rawsthorne's Recorder Suite
more than 40 years after it was written. New orchestral works by David Blake
and John Casken fell somewhere between these poles - a cello concerto from
Blake, a piece for string orchestra, Darting the skiff, from Casken.
Blake's concerto was introduced by Moray Welsh and the BBC Symphony
Orchestra under Alexander Lazarev on the first Sunday of the festival. It is
his second concerto: the first, warmly expressive and full of Italianate
lyricism, was written for violin in 1975 during work on the opera Toussaint,
and the new one also has operatic affiliations, for its protracted gestation
began in the aftermath of Blake's completion of The Plumber's Gift in 1989.
The musical substance of the cello concerto, though, is entirely
independent; it plays for 25 minutes in three connected movements, a
discursive contrast of Lento and Allegro followed by the briefest of
scherzos and a rangy set of variations which has ambitions to turn itself
into a passacaglia.
The structure is lucid and convincing, the solo writing thoroughly
idiomatic, the thematic material more or less memorable. There are some
striking moments - the sudden intrusion of a piano's incisive timbre into
the texture of the first movement as if to kick the music into a different
gear, the subversive triviality of the scherzo, the grand scheme of the
finale which ultimately squares the thematic circle when the most intimate
idea of the first movement returns in the final bars, lyrically adorned by
the cello.
Darting the skiff was also intended for a cellist. Heinrich Schiff was due
to conduct the Cheltenham premiere with the Northern Sinfonia, but withdrew
from the concert on Tuesday with illness and Casken himself took charge of
the nimble first performance. The title comes from Gerard Manley Hopkins;
the ghost of a pun is intended, but it also conjures images of boats moving
on water and the play of reflected light that had provided the starting
point for the work.
Casken contrasts two types of material in the 17-minute span - sinewy,
propulsive figuration and sustained, still meditation, as if the components
of a string introduction and allegro had been cut up and interlaced. The
music's range of mood and tempo is continually fascinating, the interplay of
thematic elements and the textural variation always diverting; it seemed at
a single hearing a most useful addition to the string orchestra's repertory.

FT  16 JUL 93 / Arts: Dvorak's 'Dimitrij' - Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On first meeting Dvorak's opera Dimitrij (1882, much revised later), it was
reassuring to find so many familiar characters from the Pushkin-Mussorgsky
Boris Godunov (1869-72); for this is the story about what happened after the
death of Boris. 'Dimitrij' is indeed the Pretender Dmitri, a lusty tenor
still, falling in love with the Tsarina Xenia (a mature young woman now)
whilst almost wedding Marina, the scheming Polish princess whom Mussorgsky
added to Boris as female interest. Shuisky continues to scheme too, though
he has become a baritone, and Dmitri's supposed royal mother Marfa is
re-enlisted for new crises.
I have been unable to learn whether Dvorak knew anything about Mussorgsky's
ground-breaking work, but the evidence internal to Dimitrij would suggest
not. Probably he and his librettist began from Pushkin alone. In Czech
regions the piece was warmly received for a few years, but it scarcely
travelled. Tuesday's Queen Elizabeth Hall concert performance by the
Kensington Symphony Orchestra was in fact the opera's London premiere.
Its conductor Russell Keable was responsible for the 1979 British premiere
in Nottingham too, where the same hybrid version of the score was used: a
brave, incomplete attempt to recover the 1882 original, settling for
Dvorak's second thoughts whenever his first ones were unavailable. In
dramatic terms, the differences between them are probably not very
significant. Though Dimitrij has some fine, lofty passages of Dvorakian
feeling - especially, and luckily, towards the end - it is theatrically
hobbled by its clumping pace and its four-square rhythms.
Also by its relentlessly conformist, academic four-part harmony, expanded
sometimes into double-chorus stuff - devout Russians against crude, secular
Poles (here the Vasari and the Elysian Singers struck no sparks off each
other) - but not varied enough to let in any bracing air. And its deadly
recitatives, too obviously pencilled in over Dvorak's chordal meditations:
Peter Tyrrell's translation fails, as anybody's might, to jockey key words
into the right musical places: again and again, where in Czech the emphases
may be just, they had a dull, false ring in the Englishing. In effect that
left the singers to sing stilted subtitles, instead of passionate
admissions.
Graeme Matheson-Bruce tackled the long, strenuous role of Dimitrij with his
usual finesse, and calculated risks on top notes. His was the most searching
performance of the evening - though in a white dinner jacket and in classy
English, something of the false Pretender's inner plight was missed. Pauline
Tinsley gave sterling moral weight as Marfa, and Peter Savidge the opposite
as Shuisky. Bronwen Mills' Xenia was sensitive, frail and uneven; Maria Moll
was a stentorian Marina, urgently musical even in her hefty, charmless
fortissimo.
There was sound, low-voice Establishment ballast from Tom McVeigh and
Stephen Holloway, and as the would-be rapists David Tilley and Paul im Thurn
were disarmingly tame. Eminently worth hearing, all of it; but no case for
actually staging Dimitrij again has been made.

FT  16 JUL 93 / Technology: Moving into the fast track - High-speed digital
networks are the next leap forward
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
International Business Machines has joined a growing body of companies in
the computer and communications industries backing Asynchronous Transfer
Mode as the definitive technology for high-speed digital networks - the
'information superhighways' of the future.
ATM is 'the springboard to the next great leap forward in communications,'
says Ellen Hancock, IBM senior vice-president and general manager of IBM
Network Systems, which this week announced plans for a range of ATM
products.
'We have made a fundamental shift to increase our investments in developing
ATM,' she adds.
ATM is a set of international standards that define a new method for sending
large quantities of voice, data and video information simultaneously over
networks linking computers across offices, and ultimately across continents,
at speeds up to 1,000 times faster than is currently possible.
Worldwide demand for ATM products will rise from Dollars 275m (Pounds 185m)
this year to Dollars 3.1bn in 1997, predict analysts at Gartner Group, a US
high-technology market research firm.
ATM is based upon the same principals as the 'packet switching' technology
used in today's data communications networks such as BT's Tymnet.
Information is broken up into 'packets' or 'cells', each labelled with an
address to which it must be delivered.
To accommodate different types of information, such as video and voice
signals, ATM establishes a standard cell format and size. In this way, ATM
provides the communications equivalent of a multi-lane highway along which
information cells can travel at varying speeds, switching lanes to overtake
slower 'vehicles'.
In contrast, today's data networks resemble single-lane streets, with speed
restrictions. Traditional telephone networks might be compared with the
railways, with voice traffic being routed by circuit switches like as the
'points' on the tracks.
Although well suited to long voice messages, or 'trains', these networks are
less efficient carriers of the shorter 'bursty' signals that computers
typically send. The primary advantage of ATM is that it can be used to
expand the amount of information existing networks can carry by making more
efficient use of the bandwidth. It is also well suited to 'multimedia'
applications and provides the basis for 'internetworking'; linking local and
wide area networks.
ATM is not the first digital communications technology to promise such
advantages. IBM is one of many companies to have invested in the development
of products based on Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN), an earlier
digital telecom-
munications standard, that has not lived up to expectations for widespread
implementation, particularly in the US.
IBM is more sanguine about the prospects for ATM. 'We believe that the
demand is there for cost-efficient bandwidth and multimedia communications,'
says Hancock. 'ATM is a technology that responds to real needs.'
Providing a 'graceful migration path' to ATM, so that customers can take
advantage of the new technology while preserving their investments in
existing networks, is the critical issue in the emerging ATM market, says
Stan Kramer, ATM product line manager at Stratacom, a Silicon Valley company
that is one of the pioneers in high-speed networking technology.
IBM also acknowledges its customers are looking for a way gradually to
incorporate ATM technology into their networks. 'We've designed a strategy
that lets them do exactly that,' says Hancock, 'by bringing users on local
area networks (LANs) into the ATM world, then linking users throughout the
enterprise. And they won't have to discard current equipment to do this.'
The first IBM products incorporating ATM technology will be introduced next
year. These will include adapter cards for computer workstations and
servers, and IBM's intelligent switching hub, developed in partnership with
Chipcom, a Southborough, Massachusetts, manufacturer of networking
equipment.

FT  16 JUL 93 / Technology: A global concept - Virtual companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the corporate battle zone of the 1990s, even successful companies have to
move fast to avoid defeat. As the travails of IBM, General Motors,
Volkswagen and others have shown, the proven business methods of the past
are no guarantee that sales and profits will continue to flourish.
Increasingly, executives are turning to alliances, partnerships and joint
ventures, often formed to produce particular products and then disbanded.
These enable costs to be shared, development times to be shortened and
effective use to be made of design, manufacturing and marketing skills
inside and outside the company.
Such linkages - variously described as virtual corporations or agile
enterprises - are made easier by computer technology. They can be set up,
controlled and reshaped quickly and flexibly so companies can draw on
worldwide resources to achieve their objectives.
'Information technology, because it's going to become as ubiquitous as the
telephone system, is going to enable people to have totally different
concepts of how they work together,' says David Allen, director of European
strategic marketing at Ungermann-Bass, the US-based computer equipment
company. He sees ideas like the virtual corporation as part of the business
re-engineering process by which many companies are fundamentally changing
the way they operate.
Ungermann-Bass, owned by Tandem Computers, has produced a series of combined
hardware and software products which enable companies to link up their
terminals, workstations and printers almost as they please, without
incurring heavy extra expenditure on new equipment or running the risk that
this will be outmoded. These products, described as Virtual Network
Architecture, are designed to allow information to flow where it is needed
and not just be restricted to small groups of users.
Allen believes Europe is at least a year behind the US in corporate
re-engineering. He cites the example of German companies which want to cut
traditionally high costs and employment levels while remaining global
players. 'The virtual corporation is going to start giving them concepts
they can use.'
With the associated technology - other aspirants in this field include
SynOptics and Kalpana, both of the US - this allows companies to draw on
international resources in a way that would previously have been difficult.
'Why shouldn't you have somebody in an office in England designing a
product, having it produced in Japan or Taiwan and marketed in America, with
all this being controlled totally at arms' length but appearing to be linked
together,' says Allen.
There are plenty of examples of link-ups in the motor, computer,
electronics, aerospace and other industries. Roger Nagel, operations
director at Lehigh University's Iacocca Institute in Pennsylvania, cites US
Car (an electric car venture between Ford, General Motors, and Chrysler),
Sematech (in semiconductors) and the tie-up between Apple, IBM and Motorola
in computer systems and equipment. Nagel, who recently spoke at a series of
European seminars on computer networking technology organised by
Ungermann-Bass, says such partnerships do not depend on electronic
integration, but are certainly enhanced by it.
VNA enables computer systems to be linked without the need for extra
components. This, the company claims, makes it cost effective. It works with
existing user networks and is capable of being upgraded to the next stage of
networking technology, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) which will enable
information to be passed between computers at extremely high speeds.
With VNA, life is made easier for those controlling computer networks.
Instead of extensive recabling, managers can simply identify various layers
of their networks on a screen and reconfigure the different user groups at
the push of a button. Ungermann-Bass's products, DragonSwitch and
NetDirector/VNA, are designed to make these links - up to 65,000 groupings
can be set up in one organisation - in individual sites and across the
world. They can be used with systems operating on any software, chiefly
Microsoft and Lotus, and satisfy user's desire for speed of operation.
A businessman will be able to call up information at will on, for example,
his company's activities in the Far East or research developments. 'For the
first time,' Allen says, 'he will be able to get information on anything
from anywhere on one terminal.' This will allow companies to share
information on a 24-hour basis between continents. Multi-media applications,
with pictures, sound and data on screen, will also be possible.
If, however, businesses are to assess the benefits of such products
properly, computer companies must stress the applications clearly.
'Networking is a great bore for them (executives). They don't understand it
or want to. They just want the information there when they need it,' says
Allen.

FT  16 JUL 93 / People: Policy Studies Institute
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Pamela Meadows, chief economics adviser and head of the economics, research
and evaluation division at the Department of Employment, becomes the next
director of the Policy Studies Institute from the beginning of October.
She takes over from Bill Daniel, who has been in the job for seven years,
and who is stepping down, aged 54, to devote more time to his own area of
research expertise - employment and industrial relations.
'If I were asked to describe my ideal job, this would be it,' says Meadows,
44, simply. After 19 years in the Civil Service, she says the appeal is
presiding over a body of work that is 'at the interface between very
respectable academic research and work which influences the policy agenda'.
PSI has a permanent staff of 70 people, with some 50 full-time researchers,
and calls itself Britain's leading independent social research institute.
Annual turnover is around Pounds 2.5-3m and it has a forward order book of
about 12 months.
She happens to have known Daniel for 15 years; one of her first tasks when
she joined Employment was to manage a project that Daniel was doing. Her
government department is a significant funder of PSI - notably contributing
to the recent Employment in Britain Survey.
As well as developing the research side, part of her job will be to extend
current sources of funding, encouraging more involvement from industry and
putting together consortia of donors for the bigger projects.

FT  16 JUL 93 / People: 'Natural extension' for Cormack
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Ian Cormack is taking over the responsibilities of country corporate officer
for Citibank in London, in place of John McFarlane who moved to Standard
Chartered last month.
Cormack, 45, who says McFarlane used to work for him in the early 1980s when
Cormack was running the bank's European training and personnel activities,
describes the job as a natural extension of his current responsibilities.
'In some countries - like Brazil - it would take up much more time. The good
news is that I was already involved in the City, with a lot of contact with
the Stock Exchange and the Bank of England. It was tidier than to find
someone else, and it is not an enormous amount of incremental work unless
there is a crisis.'
The job requires a good external and internal communicator, someone who
knows the clients as well as someone who can work with regulators and the
rest of the banking community at a senior level.
Among the many committees on which Cormack sits, he has recently been
appointed chairman of CHAPS, the electronic system for clearing and settling
wholesale payments; he is on the council of APACS, the umbrella body for all
UK clearing systems. He was also chairman of the TAURUS monitoring group -
'we were on the outside looking in,' he says  - as well as a member of the
subsequent securities settlements task force at the Bank of England.
His mid-Atlantic twang notwithstanding, Cormack, born in Scotland and
brought up in Cornwall, is now 'the most senior Brit' in the London office.
He joined Citi in 1969, and worked for his first decade in real estate, both
from New York and Paris. Current responsibilities are for European financial
institutions and transaction services - the latter including cash
management, global custody, and electronic information businesses. Both
areas are larger than the equivalent businesses in the US and are bigger
profit earners in Europe than everything else except foreign exchange.
McFarlane's replacement running the UK corporate banking business is Ed
Holmes who had previously been in charge of the Nordic region and is now
adding the UK to his responsibilities.

FT  16 JUL 93 / People: Stalking and poaching in Scotland's banks
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It is almost unprecedented for Scotland's two leading banks, the Royal Bank
of Scotland and the Bank of Scotland, to poach each other's senior
executives. But the Royal Bank is increasingly aggressive these days and has
now lured Leith Robertson, one of the Bank of Scotland's senior management
buyout specialists, to become its corporate director in charge of mbos and
acquisition finance. His job at Bank of Scotland was chief manager,
corporate banking.
Bank of Scotland has been very successful in providing debt for mbos and
Royal Bank wants to expand further in this area.
The appointment of Robertson, 41, who has spent all his career at the Bank
of Scotland, is also another sign of the Royal Bank's tendency under its ceo
George Mathewson to fill senior posts from outside its own hierarchy.
Robertson will replace and report to Donald Workman (left), who becomes
director of commercial banking services. Workman joined the Royal Bank last
year from Credit Lyonnais Capital Markets, though until 1991 he was managing
director of Castleforth Fund Managers, a venture capital company which was a
joint venture between Royal Bank and Credit Lyonnais.
Another relative newcomer to the bank is Frank Kirwan (right),who is to be
director of retail banking services in the branch banking division. Kirwan
joined the bank in 1988 from the Scottish Development Agency to which he was
recruited by Mathewson, who was then its ceo.
At the Royal, Mathewson made Kirwan director of strategy; he was involved in
cementing its alliance with Banco Santander of Spain and, more recently,
disposing of the merchant bank Charterhouse.

Few spin-offs from the Russian space programme have proven as bizarre as the
case of the long-life fish food.
A way of preserving food during the long trips into space is now being used
in the former Soviet Union to preserve worms and larvae as fish bait or as a
food for aquarium fish. The wriggly creatures are sealed into sachets
containing a fluid, details of which remain secret.
Here they can live for up to six weeks, long enough for them to be imported
into the UK by Barraclough's Fish and Aquarium Supplies, of Bradford.

Going out to tender for large projects can prove a nightmare, with employees
reduced to sifting through mountains of details once the bids are put in.
To aid such companies Computer Management Group (CMG) is marketing a system
developed by PowerGen which uses artificial intelligence to help pick the
successful bidder. The Intelligent Contract Management System (ICMS)
combines expert systems, where the software responds as an expert evaluator
would, with neural networks, which 'learn' how to assess the bids as the
system is used.
The software analyses the data and produces a report on each bid,
highlighting errors, where clarification is needed and so on. It can also
recommend which bid to accept on the basis of the tender and previous work.

FT  16 JUL 93 / Management: Jobs for the men - Male inroads into areas
dominated by women may be easing unemployment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD and DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Chuck Savoy, a male secretary in his 40s, may represent the new asexual face
of the British labour market. Savoy, who has been temping for Manpower for
six years, is still an oddity in the female-dominated secretarial world.
But a lot of his male friends who thought they had jobs for life are now
unemployed, while Savoy has worked throughout the recession.
With male unemployment close to 14 per cent and female unemployment at 5.5
per cent, and most of the new jobs being created in sectors traditionally
dominated by women, men could increasingly be forced to compete on women's
terrain in the jobs market.
Indeed some labour market analysts attribute the earlier than expected fall
in unemployment to the fact that men are already starting to abandon their
reluctance to take up lower paid, 'female', service-sector work.
The theory is that in the early 1980s recession there was a double mismatch
of geography and sex: male, heavy industrial jobs, were being lost in the
old industrial regions, while female, service sector and light industrial
jobs, were being created in the south-east.
The more even spread of unemployment in the early 1990s recession has meant
that there is less of a geographical mismatch between the old jobs and the
new, and changing attitudes among men have alleviated the sex mismatch.
There is no hard evidence for such a change of attitude, yet there is also
little more than circumstantial evidence for the original assumption that
men are excluded, or are excluding themselves, from the new jobs.
Some facts are, however, clear. Already nine counties and two Scottish
regions have more female than male employees, including traditional
industrial areas such as Mid Glamorgan. Recent figures from the Equal
Opportunities Commission revealed that 40 per cent of complaints now come
from men fighting employer assumptions about the female nature of certain
jobs.
Chris Haskins, chairman of Northern Foods, says: 'It can be very difficult
to avoid a kind of discrimination in favour of women.,' In Northern Foods,
he says, the male/female balance has shifted from about 65 per cent male to
35 per cent female 10 years ago to 50:50 now. 'Food industry jobs used to
require physical strength but a lot of them have now been replaced by light
industrial production-line jobs requiring dexterity not strength. Women are
usually better at those jobs - you sometimes do see young men surrounded by
women on a production line but they look awkward and out of place,' he
explains.
The Timex dispute appeared to underscore how women have become the dominant
group in the UK labour market, at least for unskilled and semi-skilled work.
Of the workforce that went on strike to defend its pay and conditions, about
80 per cent were women and the workers who crossed the picket line to
undermine those terms and conditions were almost all men.
The growth of female preference may not just have been employer led. Alison
Scott, a senior lecturer at Essex University, who is writing a book on
male/female segregation based on a study of 6,000 people, says: 'Female jobs
have low status and as such can be an affront to the male sexual identity.
Many would prefer to be unemployed than sell cosmetics in a department
store.'
Peter Ashby, of Full Employment UK, believes that male reluctance to take
female jobs has more to do with money than psychology. If a man is a main
bread-winner it is often not financially worthwhile to take a low-paying or
part-time job. Alison Scott agrees that the poverty trap is a critical
factor. 'A retailing job is probably paying about Pounds 3.20 an hour, which
for a 35-hour week comes out at Pounds 112 - hardly a breadwinner's wage.'
Some of the ideas currently coming out of Training and Enterprise Councils,
which administer government-funded training and enterprise programmes, are
trying to grapple with this problem. Aztec, a Tec in South London, has for
example got government funding for a pilot project for what it calls
'portfolio working', which will subsidise individuals seeking to take up two
or more part-time jobs.
The nature of some of the new jobs may also be helping to break down
male/female segregation. Lilian Bennett, who chairs Manpower UK, the largest
private sector employment agency in the UK, says that a lot of the new
clerical jobs - such as data processing and data entry - are sexless in
nature. And Savoy thinks that PCs are starting to de-sexualise secretarial
jobs by bringing in a 'male' technology dimension.
Susan Cooper, joint managing director of the Mari Group, a private-sector
training and information technology group based in Tyneside, agrees. About
50 per cent of trainees on Mari's clerical and computing courses are men, a
proportion which she says has increased over the years. Men, she says, are
accepting jobs as secretaries and receptionists but feel more comfortable
with jobs called computer operator or technician. 'A secretary now is often
the information technology manager, and men feel OK with that.'
She believes that men's slowness in entering clerical jobs is due partly to
their reluctance and partly to that of employers. 'The women on the courses
get jobs first.' As regards personnel problems, she says: 'Once the initial
step has been taken, employers are surprised at how well things work out.
Men do not appear embarrassed to do a job such as receptionist in our
company.' The main problem, she says, 'was lack of verbal communication
skills, particularly on the telephone'.
On pay she says: 'We re-trained a lot of shipworkers from Wearside in
clerical and desk-top publishing skills. They were only earning Pounds 7,000
a year, so they were already low-waged.'
Some labour market analysts believe the way to make it possible for more men
to take female jobs is to establish a 'critical mass' of men in the relevant
jobs, mirroring the way that women have broken into areas of traditional
male employment.
That may take a long time in some sectors. In nursing, the proportion of men
has hovered around 10 per cent since 1945, according to Christine Hancock,
head of the Royal College of Nursing, and shows no signs of rising.

FT  16 JUL 93 / Management: The risks of sleeping with the enemy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER LORENZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Like a one-person computer dating agency with himself as its main client,
Robert E. Allen went stomping around Europe last week throwing out public
invitations for all and sundry to climb into bed with him.
In more seemly metaphor, the chairman of AT&amp;T went fishing: trying to net
any telecommunications company, almost anywhere, that might wish to join the
WorldSource venture that AT&amp;T set up in late May with Asian-Pacific partners
to serve multinational corporate customers. What was so striking about
Allen's expedition was not just his brazen behaviour, but that he made it
quite clear that AT&amp;T would welcome with open arms companies with which in
other markets it competes.
Barely a month ago a similar declaration was made by the chairman of one of
his smaller rivals, Iain Vallance, of BT. Announcing a far-reaching deal
with MCI, one of Allen's main US challengers, the BT boss said he did not
rule out future co-operation with AT&amp;T on non-competitive projects.
This is not just a matter of a would-be Goliath and a real one jockeying for
position in a particular industry. Similar behaviour is to be found
elsewhere. Last month Pratt &amp; Whitney joined forces in small aero-engines
with General Electric, its arch US rival, to fight a joint venture between
Britain's Rolls-Royce and Germany's BMW. Yet Pratt has also been talking to
Rolls about extending an alliance which they have had for some time in the
upper reaches of the aero-engine market - against GE.
The growth of such promiscuous relationships, in industries from telecoms to
cars, aerospace to electronics, seems at first sight to support the argument
of a new book called Collaborating to Compete (Wiley, Pounds 19.95), that
'sleeping with the enemy' tends to be good for your corporate health - that
it enhances your performance.
The metaphor is not mine. It is used repeatedly in the book by Joel Bleeke
and David Ernst, who edited and co-authored the volume, with fellow McKinsey
consultants. The use of 'sleeping with the enemy' was meant to make
alliances sound exciting and attractive. But to many people it will
underline their risks.
As any Julia Roberts fan will know, the character she plays in a 1991 film
of that name has long since ceased to be a willing party to the relationship
with the enemy in question - her husband. He seems to be the ideal partner,
but then begins to exploit, humiliate and assault her. She tries to break
away from him but fails. In the end the only way she can escape is to kill
him.
That exit route is not available to an unfortunate company weakened by the
stranglehold of a once-attractive partner-turned-enemy. All it can usually
do is submit and get out of the business concerned - as countless alliance
enthusiasts have been forced to do.
The extent of the damage done to several large US industries by naive
sleeping around with far eastern 'allies' was well charted in a recent
article by David Lei and John Slocum in the California Management Review
(CMR)*. They demonstrated starkly how a company 'which does not understand
the risks inherent in such arrangements' can be 'de-skilled' by its partner.
So what should you do to avoid such a fate? Steer clear of alliances
entirely - turn celibate? Or sleep only with partners unlikely to become
hostile?
Neither is feasible these days. Some alliances are a 'must' for most
companies, given the attractions of saving costs and time in at least one
part of their 'value chain'. As with AT&amp;T, the need to leap political
barriers to markets can also play a role.
Nor is avoiding competitors always an option. You should usually link with
the strongest partner, which often means with rivals; if you avoid them,
they will only team up with others.
The degree of danger in an alliance varies by its type, breadth and depth,
and by its intended duration; by industry; and by each partner's particular
situation, especially its degree of dependence on the relationship.
So any shortlist of ground rules is by definition incomplete. But several
are fundamental. As in sexual activity, they amount to 'take extreme
precautions'.
First, be sparing with your favours. Do not be as promiscuous, for instance,
as IBM. Definitely do not measure yourself on 'how many alliances have we
made this quarter?' - a foolish and unmanageable piece of machismo which
obsesses far too many companies.
Second, be clear that the main purpose of an alliance is to learn from your
partner-rival, not just to fill a short-term product, service or market gap.
Lei and Slocum are especially damning about US industry's record here.
Third, avoid sharing any of your core competences (technological, managerial
or whatever) with a partner unless absolutely necessary. This is easier said
than done, especially if you have not yet defined properly what they are.
Fourth, build barriers - internal as well as external - against the seepage
of skills to your partner. Control carefully the boundaries of the alliance,
even if they need re-negotiating from time to time. Creating such barriers
is obviously easier when you have relatively few partners, when only limited
parts of your organisation are involved and when such relationships are
reasonably stable. That is a far cry from the all-permeable, 'borderless'
company advocated by many US business gurus.
In other words, by no means everyone should share their favours as liberally
as Robert E. Allen. Monogamy may not be practical these days, but nor is
constant coupling with a shifting set of multiple partners.

FT  16 JUL 93 / The Property Market: Reversing trends - The new-found
interest in the UK private rented sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'We hope the major institutional investors will soon take the view that a
well-balanced portfolio should include residential property.'
Sir George Young, minister for housing, speaking at a seminar organised by
the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors last week.
As matters stand, Sir George Young's ambition is a lost cause. Decades of
restrictive legislation, poor returns and the tarnished image of landlords
have made British investment institutions profoundly averse to the
residential sector.
Despite this, the government is taking the need to revive the private rented
sector increasingly seriously. It is considering the introduction of new
incentives, which could turn the tide in favour of the private rented
sector.
In May, Mr John Major, the prime minister, said: 'There is clearly a need
for a larger private rented sector in Britain. We have released some of the
old shackles on landlords. But we may need to go further if the sector is to
show any significant growth.'
This new-found interest in the private rented sector stems from a change of
heart in government and among prospective buyers in general over the merits
of ownership. After a decade when home ownership was seen as an unalloyed
blessing, the recession has exposed its shortcomings. Repossessions,
mortgage arrears and the problems of so-called negative equity (when the
value of the property falls below the mortgage secured on it) have convinced
many people that the advantages of owner-occupation were greatly
exaggerated.
At the same time, economists are concerned that labour mobility is impeded
by excessive owner-occupation, which inflicts heavy costs on people
relocating.
The huge increase in owner-occupation in the 1980s also included for the
first time a large proportion in their early 20s, many of whom found the
combination of easy credit and the house-owning culture of Thatcherism
irresistible. For many of these people renting would have been a better
option.
'We have to get away from the idea that the rented sector is just for a
residue of people who cannot afford home ownership,' says Sir George.
But any increase in the private rented sector will require a reversal of a
deep-seated trend against this sector. The stock of private rented housing
fell by some 800,000 properties during the years of Mrs Margaret Thatcher's
premiership, from 1979-1990. In the UK, only 8 per cent of households are in
the private rented sector, compared with 40 per cent in the former West
Germany and 29 per cent in the US.
The reasons for the move away from private rented housing (which in 1914
accounted for 90 per cent of the housing stock) include tax benefits (such
as mortgage interest relief) that have favoured home owners and the post-war
urban renewal programmes that swept away large tracts of rented housing.
Most important of all, however, was the impact of rent controls.
The rent controls that came into force in 1965 reduced rent drastically.
This had the effect of cutting landlords' rent revenues, making property an
even more unattractive investment.
The Housing Act of 1988 abolished rent controls for certain types of
tenancy, but its long-term impact is still unclear.
Some private sector landlords, such as Bradford Property Trust, believe that
renting out property is now an attractive investment. However, sceptics
remain unconvinced. They say that the rise in private lettings in the past
couple of years owes more to temporary factors, such as the property-related
Business Expansion Schemes which will be phased out at the end of the year
and the trend for house owners to rent out their properties until a buyer is
found.
To achieve a broader-based expansion of the private rented sector, says
Professor Duncan MacLennan of Glasgow University, the government must
provide additional incentives. 'Deregulation is a necessary but not
sufficient condition for expansion of the private rented sector,' he says.
'It needs financial and fiscal backing to make it work.'
The Joseph Rowntree Foundation, a social research organisation, argues that
tax breaks are needed to increase the real returns available from rented
housing; returns presently stand at about 6 per cent, but they would need to
rise by an extra 2 per cent to attract a significant number of new
investors.
A report commissioned by the foundation from accountants Coopers &amp; Lybrand
urges the government to introduce 40 per cent first-year capital allowances
for rented property. The remainder of the cost should be set against tax at
4 per cent, says the report, which is to be published later this month.
Moreover, it adds, rental income should be treated as trading income and
rented property should be exempt from capital gains tax, provided that it is
held for at least 10 years.
Given that these incentives could result in the provision of an extra 50,000
rented homes a year, but at a cost to the exchequer of about Pounds 5,000
for each property, the idea is unlikely to be greeted with enthusiasm by the
Treasury at a time when it is trying to curb spending.
But even if the government were prepared to introduce incentives, there are
other obstacles. Few institutions would be prepared to take on the burden of
managing residential property.
Indeed the notion of direct investment in private rented property is
unattractive to most funds. The Prudential, Britain's biggest life assurer,
says: 'We feel it is unlikely that institutional investors will be persuaded
to invest in private residential housing due to lack of liquidity and the
small size of potential investments.'
But even if institutions are not prepared to invest directly, they might be
inclined to invest indirectly by delegating the management and contact with
tenants to a third party. Coopers &amp; Lybrand believes that there is potential
in the notion of a residential unit trust, the tax treatment of which would
be more suitable for funds that invest in property companies.
There may be other factors, however, to discourage funds from investing in
rented property. Asda Property, which in 1985 was split evenly between
residential and commercial property, has disposed of the bulk of its
residential holdings and reinvested in commercial property. The reason
behind this decision, says Mr Tony Roscoe, managing director, was more than
just a question of returns. 'In commercial property, there is more scope for
entrepreneurial flair. It is a less homogeneous product. Residential
property is more a numbers game.' Moreover, he adds, running a residential
portfolio is management-intensive because properties tend to be spread
geographically.
Funds are also wary of the political risk associated with investing in
private rented housing. Mr Neville Lee, chairman of the Association of
Residential Letting Agents, says the real problem is that landlords are
concerned that a Labour government might reintroduce rent controls. 'The
market simply doesn't trust them,' he says.
Nor is Conservative policy above suspicion, in the view of some landlords.
The leasehold reform bill, which if enacted would force landlords to sell
freeholds to leaseholders, does not inspire confidence among many property
owners.
Changing the attitudes of landlords towards the rented sector promises to be
an uphill struggle. But in the view of many involved in housing policy, the
current disaffection with home ownership presents the government with a rare
opportunity to expand the rented sector.

FT  16 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: White paper proposals broaden
access to information
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE main proposals included in the government's white paper on open
government, which was published yesterday are:
A code of practice on access to information. This would be introduced from
April 1994 and apply to central government departments and agencies, with
similar codes for the National Health Service and local authorities.
There will be consultation with the organisations before the codes are
finalised, but the aim is that they provide clear statements of information
the government will volunteer and what it will provide on request.
The central government code will include a commitment to meet reasonable
requests for information relating to departmental policies and decisions.
Exemptions will cover information where, for example, disclosure would harm
defence or security; would harm the decision-taking process within
government; might prejudice legal proceedings; or would harm the
government's ability to manage the economy. A new role for the ombudsman.
The ombudsman will police the way departments operate the code. If someone
believes that information has been wrongly withheld, and an MP passes the
complaint on to the ombudsman's department, he can investigate whether the
government has acted according to the code. The cross-party committee of MPs
which covers the ombudsman's work can call ministers and officials to
account if the ombudsman believes they have not behaved properly.
A statutory right of access to personal information. This would apply to
records held by government departments, local authorities, the NHS, the
police and schools and colleges. Categories of information and exemptions
for these public sector bodies would be similar to the Data Protection Act,
which introduced a right of access to public and private-sector records held
on computer.
A statutory right of access to health and safety information held by public
authorities. This would cover matters such as the safety of public places
and consumer goods. Protection would be provided for genuine trade secrets
and manufacturing knowhow, and past information given in confidence would
not be revealed. The aim would be to make the regulation process more
understandable and transparent to the public and affected industries.
In the case both of this right and the right to personal information, there
would be a right of appeal to an external authority, such as an independent
tribunal.
Both rights would not be retrospective and would apply only to information
provided once they had passed into law.
A two-tier charging system, with a flat-rate fee for straightforward
information and a higher charge for information requiring additional work,
could be introduced for information disclosed under the code of practice or
the new statutory rights.
Selective introduction of 'harm tests'. Where statutory limits on the
government's ability to release information are retained, there is the
prospect of introducing 'harm tests'. These would ensure that no one would
be penalised for disclosing information unless its release did some damage.
Review and release of public records. In future, records will not be closed
for longer than 30 years unless actual damage would be done by their
release. Special treatment for royal papers will end.
Guiding principles will be that records remain closed for longer than 30
years only where release would harm national security, defence or the UK's
economic interests; would be a breach of good faith; or would cause
substantial distress or danger.

FT  16 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Steps on road to openness
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RACHEL JOHNSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OPEN government proposals are likely to add to the list of recent landmark
legislation which opens up new categories of records - in this case health
and safety records - to individual scrutiny.
Mr Eric Howe, the data protection registrar, said that the document was
'another step along the road giving new statutory rights of access to
personal records held by public authorities'.
The starting point in civil liberty legislation is the Data Protection Act
1984, which gives people the right to see the records held about them on
computer in both public and private sector institutions.
This was followed by the Access to Personal Files Act 1987 which opens the
files held by local authorities relating to social services and housing
tenancies.
The next step forward was the Access to Medical Records Act 1988, which
provides access to medical reports written for insurance and employment
purposes. The Official Secrets Act 1989 then repealed some of the catch-all
provisions preventing civil servants revealing public information.
Shortly after, the Access to Personal Files Act 1990 gave access to selected
records held by housing and social services authorities. In the same year,
the Access to Health Records Act provided access to manual health records in
addition to the automated ones opened up previously by the DPA.
On top of this, individual government departments are expected under the
Citizen's Charter to give the public the information they need.
In most cases they discharge this duty by publishing explanatory leaflets
and newsletters for public consumption. Other parts of the public sector
publish fuller annual reports, setting out performance against commitments
or bulletins on efficiency and punctuality.

FT  16 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Bosnian peace plan 'misconceived'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROGER MATTHEWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IMPOSING a peace plan on Bosnia from the outside is impractical, the Commons
foreign affairs committee concluded yesterday in a report on the expanding
role of the United Nations.
The 11-member committee said calls for military deployment to enforce a
disputed peace plan had been misconceived - adding that UN troops equipped
for humanitarian or peace-keeping purposes could not be transformed into a
fighting force to protect safe havens by passing a new resolution at the
Security Council.
'We fear that attempting to impose a plan could make things worse, not
better for the civilian population, as well as having serious consequences
for for the safety of UN personnel,' the report stated.
Looking more broadly at the UN's involvement in the world's trouble spots,
particularly Bosnia, Cambodia and Somalia, the committee recommended that
any requests for political or military intervention should be examined far
more rigorously.
It said it had to be accepted that not all proposals for a peace-keeping
operation could be successfully put into effect, because they were
impractical or because the human and financial resources were not available.
The committee complained that some UN decisions to intervene militarily had
not been taken according to a clear set of guiding principles, but in
response to sudden emergencies. The UN, for example, had moved into Somalia
but had not become involved in other comparable humanitarian disasters, such
as in Sudan.
It stressed that there had always to be a distinction between peace-keeping
and enforcement, and warned of grave difficulties in trying to combine the
two functions in a single location.
The approach to the imposition of UN sanctions also needed to be changed,
the committee said. Limited sanctions had not proved effective.
In order to make sanctions a much more effective weapon they had to be
accompanied from the outset by a land, sea and air blockade, together with a
sophisticated range of controls over commercial, financial and trading
mechanisms.
The report also urged the UN to increase its capacity to identify possible
crisis areas, to rely more on 'preventive diplomacy'.

FT  16 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Matrix case would see little change
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THOUGH the furore that surrounded the Matrix Churchill trial might have been
one of the factors prodding the government into reforming its freedom of
information policy, yesterday's white paper seems unlikely to have made much
difference to the issues that dominated the case.
For although the paper promises better rights for individuals wishing to
gain access to their personal files, it does not guarantee that a government
department would reveal the type of documents that proved so central to the
Matrix Churchill case.
The controversy about the release of documents in the case centred on two
issues.
The first was why the government had been able, in the late 1980s, to
withhold from parliament documents showing that it had privately changed its
policy towards arms sales to Iraq - a change that led companies like
Matrix-Churchill to believe they could deal with Iraq.
Under the new code of practice, the Ministry of Defence would, in theory,
now be under considerably greater pressure to reveal this type of policy
change. In addition to parliamentary questioning, the department could also
face policing from the parliamentary ombudsman if it failed to open its
files, and would have to comply with written requests for information.
But, since the code reiterates that parliament remains the main vehicle for
prompting disclosure, critics yesterday pointed out that without
parliamentary pressure, there would still be no means of forcing disclosure.
Mr Maurice Frankel, from the Campaign for Freedom of Information, yesterday
said: 'Under a Freedom of Information act that would have been a disclosable
document - it was only a minor policy change. That is not the case in this
white paper.'
The second issue was whether government ministers should be able to use
public interest immunity certificates to prevent the release of sensitive
documents.
On that matter, the white paper promises little change. Although, in the
Matrix case, the application was overturned, the white paper envisages that
ministers will still be able to use the immunity clause in cases affecting
national security.
Mr Paul Henderson, a former Matrix director, said yesterday: 'It was only
the release of documents that stopped us from being convicted.'

<TEXT>
THE National Federation of Fishermen's Organisations yesterday sought leave
to apply for a judicial review of the government's controversial measures to
conserve fish stocks by limiting time at sea.
The move came in spite of a meeting yesterday between fishermen's
representatives and ministers which was described as 'productive'.
The federation said it had lodged documents at the High Court to support an
application to suspend the legislation, due to come into force next January.
Under an EC agreement Britain must cut fishing by 19 per cent by 1996.

FT  16 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Straw warns on Banham review
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR yesterday issued a warning to the government not to tamper with the
Banham review of local government structure, Alison Smith writes.
Both ministers and officials within the Department of the Environment are
known to be unhappy with the review so far and to be considering ways in
which its future activities could be curtailed.
One suggestion is that after the first areas have been reviewed, future
tranches of work would be optional, and the structure of councils in some
areas would not be reviewed unless there was a substantial move for change.
But Mr Jack Straw, shadow environment secretary, called instead yesterday
for an expanded commission, a faster process of review and new guidelines
covering matters such as identifying natural communities and costing
proposals.
In a letter to Mr John Gummer, the environment secretary, Mr Straw said
Labour was still committed to unitary authorities based on district
councils, in place of the current two-tier structure.

FT  16 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Unions cool on Smith deal for
Labour reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LEADING trade unions yester-day gave a frosty reception to the deal Mr John
Smith has proposed for reforming Labour's union links, highlighting the
difficulties he still faces in avoiding a row at September's party
conference.
Although Mr Bill Morris, general secretary of the TGWU transport union, and
Mr John Edmonds, leader of the GMB general union, were careful not to
deliberately re-fuel their confrontation with the Labour leader, it was
clear that they were unhappy with a deal Mr Smith reached on Wednesday.
Mr Edmonds is under pressure particularly from 'moderniser' Labour MPs to
compromise, because of the damaging impact of the confrontation on Labour's
image. He faced angry protests at a meeting of Labour MPs on Wednesday
night. One said the level of personal bitterness had been 'extraordinary'.
Mr Smith has expressed delight at proposals drawn up by Labour's internal
union links committee on reforming leadership elections, the selection of
parliamentary candidates, and on the 'block vote' at Labour conferences.
Yesterday Mr Smith predicted a 'gathering of support' around the plans which
will be discussed by Labour's ruling National Executive Committee on Monday.
Labour officials and MPs were hopeful that enough union votes would swing
behind the Labour leader to avoid a potentially damaging conference defeat.
Among Mr Smith's main union opponents, there was a recognition that he had
compromised a little, particularly on the election of future party leaders
where 'individual' union members would continue to have a vote in a reformed
electoral college.
But there was bitterness at what was seen as an attempt by Mr Smith to
bounce unions into accepting a deal.
Mr Morris said reports of an agreement with the unions were 'not true' and
that for union links with Labour to be 'properly maintained' there had to be
'a genuine opportunity for the voice of trade unions to be collectively
expressed in all important decisions, including the selection of
parliamentary candidates'.
He added: 'It is our view that the proposals emanating from the working
group fall well short of this principle.'
The GMB is not opposed to all parts of Mr Smith's reforms, but it objects
particularly to his proposal that unions should pay a membership fee, in
addition to the political levy, in order to become 'registered' union
members entitled to vote when constituency parties select candidates.
There is scope for compromise over the summer, however, because the GMB
backs the idea of a register of Labour-supporting union members. A deal
could be struck on Mr Smith's definition of a 'register' and on the extra
fee that union members would have to pay.

FT  16 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: PM silent on Maastricht vote
implications
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR yesterday refused to say whether the government would consider
itself bound by next week's Commons vote on Maastricht's social chapter, as
ministers prepared for a possible stalemate in the event of a government
defeat.
Challenged repeatedly to show his hand by Mr John Smith, the Labour leader,
the prime minister said only that he expected to win next week's vote and
proceed to ratify the treaty he had signed.
His approach triggered the response from Mr Smith that it would be a
'monstrous violation' of MPs' rights for the government to defy 'the will of
the House of Commons'. Such a move would 'in one fell swoop . . . undermine
our parliamentary democracy,' the Labour leader said.
The exchanges came as the government announced a motion for next week's
debate which is designed to gain the widest possible support.
It avoids expressing support for Britain's social chapter opt-out, simply
noting the government's policy on the adoption of the social policy
protocol. The bill can only come into force after MPs and peers have come to
a resolution on the matter.
But in an atmosphere of mounting intrigue at Westminster, both Euro-sceptics
and social chapter supporters were last night saying the government could
face a potentially devastating stalemate on Maastricht if its motion falls.
If that happened, MPs would almost certainly hold an immediate debate of
confidence in the government, which even opposition MPs concede the
government would win.
The stalemate would arise if Tory Euro-sceptics joined forces with
opposition parties to defeat the government. The House would not then have
to come to a resolution and so the bill could not come into force.
In such circumstances, they say, parliament's in-house legal specialists
have informed them the treaty could not be ratified. This would apply
whether or not the Labour amendment - which will be voted on first - was
accepted. Hard-line Euro-sceptics would prefer that this amendment was
carried, since this would permit them to argue they were opposing the social
chapter in the second vote.
If the Labour amendment was carried, the government would need to decide
whether to ignore parliament's verdict in the way alluded to by Mr Smith and
brave the ensuing outcry.
Government business managers were last night signalling privately that they
would be quite prepared to force parliament to continue sitting into the
summer recess, or to reconvene early in the autumn, until such a stalemate
was broken by the formulation of a new motion supported by a majority of MPs
and peers.
In a further development, Mr David Trimble, Ulster Unionist MP for Upper
Bann, said last night he expected his party's nine MPs to vote against the
government next week. The Ulster Unionists are widely thought to be the most
likely of the opposition camps to be persuaded to support the government.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Michael Portillo, chief secretary to the Treasury, told the Commons
yesterday that the latest estimate of the additional military cost of the
Gulf conflict, spread over several years, was Pounds 2,345m.
By the end of March the Export Credits Guarantee Department had paid Pounds
499m of claims arising from the situation in the Gulf in 1990-91 and which
had yet to be recovered.
Mr Portillo said that a further Pounds 160m of claims on Iraq had yet to be
examined, and other departments had incurred minor costs. The 'bulk of these
costs' had been offset by the cash contributions from other governments
totalling Pounds 2,049m.

The move came in spite of a meeting described as 'productive' between

The government has said it was willing to consider altering details of the

yesterday Mrs Gillian Shephard, the agriculture minister, Mr Ian Lang,
Scottish secretary, and Mr Michael Jack, fisheries minister, met
representatives of the English, Welsh, Scottish and Northern Ireland fishing
industries. The industry has been asked for ideas by the end of September
and ministers will continue to meet fishermen and visit ports.
The federation pointed out that ministers did not rule out bringing forward
Pounds 25m for decommissioning to be phased in over three years.
Mrs Shephard said the meeting was a genuine attempt to see if the
government's days-at-sea proposals could be modified to meet the industry's
concerns while conserving fish stocks.

FT  16 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Major and Clarke hail 'recovery'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN was coming out of recession and leading Europe into recovery, Mr
John Major, the prime minister, told the Commons yesterday.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, was also in buoyant mood when, while
stressing that the content of his November Budget had yet to be decided, he
sought to reassure Tory backbenchers alarmed by the possibility of increases
in income tax.
Both the prime minister and the chancellor emphasised the significance of
the continuing fall in unemployment, coupled with the lowest rate of
inflation for nearly 30 years.
Latest figures show unemployment falling for the fifth month in a row, on
top of yesterday's unexpected drop in inflation to 1.2 per cent.
Mr Major commented: 'Taken with the remarkable figures on Tuesday on
manufacturing output, I think we can now say with some certainty that there
is clear evidence of a recovery gathering pace.'
Reaffirming his determination to reduce the Pounds 50bn public sector
borrowing requirement, the chancellor said he shared the instincts of the
rightwing Tory MPs in the 92 Group that public expenditure restraints should
be the first consideration.
He responded in dismissive terms when Mr Robert Sheldon (Lab
Ashton-under-Lyne) suggested that an increase in the top rate of income tax
could make a contribution to reducing the 'horrendous' PSBR.
Mr Clarke described as 'slight' the additional revenue which would be raised
by increasing the 40p rate, and recalled that higher yields had resulted
from the cuts made in the 'extraordinary high levels' of taxation imposed by
the last Labour government.
He accused Labour MPs of always wanting to put up taxation 'on somebody or
other', while, as a Conservative chancellor, he was being reminded by
backbench colleagues of their party's commitment to continue to reduce
income tax 'when it is prudent to do so'.
Calling on the chancellor not to 'prostrate himself' on the altar of the
PSBR Sir Peter Tapsell (C Lindsey East) said estimates like those which had
produced the figure of Pounds 50bn were notoriously unreliable.
Mr Clarke answered that he had 'never drunk of the pure milk of monetarism'.
But the PSBR did constitute a serious problem and the monthly figures were
running in line with the forecast.
He added: 'I take the view that if the PSBR falls faster than I am at the
moment expecting I can probably deal with any problems that may cause with
considerable ease.'

MR Norman Lamont, still smarting after his dismissal from the Treasury,
discomforted the prime minister and delighted the opposition benches in the
Commons yesterday by highlighting the success of the policies with which he
was associated as chancellor, Ivor Owen writes.
Labour MPs did their utmost to underline Mr John Major's embarrassment as Mr
Lamont cited 'the catalogue of good economic indicators' which was now being
enthusiastically trumpeted by his former cabinet colleagues.
As he did so Labour backbenchers shouted the one question Mr Lamont declined
to put: 'Why was I sacked?'
With heavy irony Mr Lamont contented himself with asking the prime minister
to congratulate Mr Kenneth Clarke, his successor as chancellor 'on the rapid
success of his policies'.
The House was convulsed in glee, with even Mr Clarke, on the government
front bench, grinning broadly.
Mr Major replied: 'I know the chancellor will be most grateful for your
support of his policies'.

FT  16 JUL 93 / Eternal problems of Church funding: The crisis forcing the
General Synod to reform Anglican finances
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FEW PEOPLE attend their local church because they want to make it more
financially efficient.
Churches, like charities and voluntary organisations in general, draw
support from those who are more likely to spend money on worthwhile causes
than worry about cash flow and balanced budgets.
Such values pose particular difficulties for the Church of England. Its
status as established church, custodian of historic monuments and
stage-manager of lavish state occasions can lead to it being viewed, even by
its active members, like a public library or the National Health Service -
something everyone takes for granted but feels no personal responsibility
for having to finance.
These ingrained attitudes collided with plain talking at the summer session
of the Church's General Synod which ended in York on Tuesday. The Church of
England is in financial trouble which, synod members were warned, is going
to demand radical changes in the way it operates. By the end of the century
it must be transformed from a largely centralised institution, heavily
dependent on investment income from the Church Commissioners - who are
responsible for the Church's main investments - to one where individual
parishes pay their own way.
For the Church Commissioners' assets are not what they once were. About half
are in property, and the recent decline in the market was the main factor in
the Church's income-producing assets losing more than Pounds 800m in value
between 1989 and last year.
The Lambeth Group, a committee set up last year following criticism of the
commissioners' management of the Church's assets, is due to report soon. If
it shares the view of Sir Michael Colman, chairman of Reckitt &amp; Colman and
the first church estates commissioner, it will conclude that storing up so
much treasure in property holdings in the 1980s left the commissioners
seriously exposed.
However critical the report proves to be, the reality is that the Church has
regarded the commissioners as a perpetual taxpayer, on whose back
improvements in clergy stipends, pensions and other well-intentioned
developments have been built.
The Rt Rev John Wayne, Bishop of Chelmsford and chairman of the Lambeth
Group, says reliance on the commissioners' income has led to the assumption
that 'an Anglican pound was always worth Pounds 3 or Pounds 4' compared with
other denominations that have to raise more funds locally.
Other churches have therefore been more successful at fund-raising. A
typical Church of England worshipper gives between Pounds 2.50 and Pounds
3.00 a week - respectable by general charity fund-raising standards, but
little more than half the 5 per cent of net income that the Church
encourages.
In the Chelmsford diocese itself, which covers Essex and parts of east
London, one-third of the parishes subsidise the other two-thirds. A study is
being undertaken to discover the characteristics of a financially successful
parish but what is already clear is that the underperforming two-thirds
include parishes in the more affluent parts of Essex.
A deteriorating financial position will bring an increased emphasis on
fund-raising to the Church of England, both by trying to persuade existing
worshippers to give higher amounts, and encouraging more people to go to
church.
The Church has already made its first moves into corporate videos and
television advertising, and fund-raising styles may become more modern.
Mr Alan McLintock, chairman of the central board of finance, spoke
approvingly at the synod of high quality events with personalised
invitations and good food, compared with the more common existing method -
an evening of discussion in the church hall 'to the accompaniment of fairly
typical church refreshments which I can describe bleakly as sausage rolls
and coffee'.
Even if the Church surmounts the considerable hurdles of increasing its
local-level income substantially, other problems will arise.
One of the most fundamental of these concerns the radical change in
relationship that would be likely to develop between financially independent
parishes paying the stipends of their own clergy and the Church's national
leadership.

FT  16 JUL 93 / Council spending to increase 3.5%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LOCAL government spending will be allowed to rise by 3.5 per cent next year,
according to a ministerial letter leaked to the Local Government Chronicle.
The letter was sent in May by Mr Michael Howard - then environment secretary
 -to Mr Michael Portillo, chief secretary to the Treasury.
In the letter Mr Howard says that councils need an extra Pounds 2.14bn 'to
protect local authority services', according to the Department of the
Environment's calculations. However, he says he is prepared 'to live with'
Pounds 1.44bn. Local authority associations have requested an extra Pounds
5.14bn.
The 3.5 per cent rise would affect councils' standard spending assessments,
which determine how much grant they receive from central government, and
cover all council-controlled services. Standard spending assessments are
also used to determine the level at which council budgets may be 'capped' by
government.
Mr Howard suggests that the savings could be achieved either through pay
restraint, or through forcing councils to find greater efficiency savings.
However, he says: 'It requires an act of faith to suppose that authorities
will look for savings rather than making cuts; their recent track record is
not impressive.'
The letter also recommends a 'rapid phasing out' of transitional relief for
the council tax by the end of next year. He says: 'A sudden increase in
council tax levels in the second year could all too easily swing the public
against the tax.'
Local authorities are to meet Mr John Gummer, Mr Howard's successor as
environment secretary, next Thursday to discuss spending plans.

FT  16 JUL 93 / Gooda Walker hearing date set
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A HEARING date of April 26 was set yesterday for the legal action by some
3,000 Gooda Walker Names. It means the case will come to court up to a year
earlier than had been expected.
Mr Justice Saville, who presides in all Lloyd's actions, will hear the case,
which is the biggest by Names - the individuals whose assets support the
insurance market.
The news follows the announcement that the Serious Fraud Office is to
investigate transactions by the Gooda syndicates, which have left Names with
losses of more than Pounds 900m incurred between 1987 and 1990.
Mr Philip Rocher, of Wilde Sapte, solicitors to the Gooda Names, said the
decision to hear the cases so soon represented 'a very substantial advance
for the Names' action groups'. He added: 'It will increase pressure on the
market's authorities to settle the dispute out of court.'
The Names allege negligent underwriting and are seeking more than Pounds
500m in damages from 67 Lloyd's agencies. The case, expected to last 12
weeks, will involve presentations by a number of expert witnesses, including
Mr Ulrich von Eichen, a former executive of Munich Re, the German
reinsurance company.
Mr Michael Deeny, chairman of the Gooda Walker Action Group, which
represents Names involved, said the 'size and complexity is such that the
case was not expected to be heard until 1995'.
Mr Deeny said: 'Our legal advisers believe that the fraud investigation will
not impede our civil case. We have seen the standard wording of the errors
and omissions policies that insured Lloyd's agencies against actions like
our's for negligence. The policies explicitly cover fraud.'
Mr Justice Saville last week set a hearing date in October next year for
another large case being brought by more than 1,000 Feltrim Names.
The commercial court will also conduct hearings on a preliminary issue
relevant to both these and other Lloyd's cases in September this year. This
concerns the vicarious liability of members' agents, which handle Names'
affairs, for the actions of managing agents, which administer syndicates.

FT  16 JUL 93 / Care reform charter urged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT should develop comprehensive criteria for judging the success
of this year's community care reforms as a matter of priority, the Commons
health committee said yesterday.
The committee recommends a community care charter as part of the Citizen's
Charter initiative to provide 'an indication of the level and quality of
service which citizens are entitled to expect'.
It says the responsibilities of Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health secretary,
for ensuring community care success are 'substantially more extensive' than
the government recognised when it responded to a previous health committee
report in March this year. Then, the government stressed local authority
responsibilities and said it had 'no direct management function'.
But although the reforms have made local authorities the lead agencies for
co-ordinating community care, the committee says the government had ignored
Mrs Bottomley's statutory responsibility for personal social services. It
calls for a 'more explicit recognition' of the government's responsibilities
for ensuring that local authorities fulfil their tasks.
The committee notes the view of voluntary organisations that their
activities in the community care field were under strain because of
financial pressures, including loss of funding from the government's Urban
Programme, which is being phased out.
A proposal that the committee should recommend 'withdrawal of the cuts in
the Urban Programme in view of their impact on community care' was defeated
only on the vote of Mrs Marion Roe, the Conservative MP who chairs the
committee. It was likely, says the committee, that the new arrangements
would lead to a shakeout of independent providers of residential and
nursing-home care. This would be painful for home owners and could be
traumatic for residents if they were uprooted. It calls for local
authorities to be given support in managing reductions to minimise the
impact on residents.
The committee's call for a community care charter was generally well
received in the care sector. But Mr Toby Harris, who chairs the Association
of Metropolitan Authorities social services committee, said it would require
a revolutionary change in government policies and guidance. 'These currently
urge local authorities to conceal from potential users what the local
authority believes to be their need for service,' he said.

FT  16 JUL 93 / Shipyard directors to be made redundant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FOUR directors who led a management buy-out of Swan Hunter, the Tyneside
shipbuilder, are among 143 employees to be made redundant by the receivers
today, Chris Tighe writes.
Mr Alex Marsh and Mr Roger Vaughan, joint group chief executives, Mr
Vaughan's brother Peter, group commercial director, and Mr Ken Chapman,
group marketing director, led the Pounds 5m buy-out in 1986 acquiring the
company from state-owned British Shipbuilders.
Swan Hunter went into receivership in May and Price Waterhouse, the
receiver, said yesterday that the four directors would receive the same
state minimum redundancy terms as the other 702 employees who will have left
by the end of next week.
Price Waterhouse said they might be asked to assist on an ad hoc paid
consultancy basis but were not being retained on the payroll. They will
remain directors of Swan Hunter.
The four directors said: 'We are committed to assisting the receivers in
selling the business and thereby retain on Tyneside the capability, spirit
and team work that has led to Swan Hunter's reputation for the excellence of
its product, workmanship and design.'
They added: 'We have a great belief in the future of shipbuilding on
Tyneside.'
The latest redundancies cut the payroll to 1,700 and are understood to
include six other directors, leaving only four at the yard.

FT  16 JUL 93 / Assisted status 'sought for areas hit by defence cuts'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT is trying to gain assisted area status for parts of southern
England affected by defence industry cuts in a last-minute addition to its
proposed aid map, a leading Labour MEP said yesterday.
Some coalfield closure areas in Nottinghamshire and South Yorkshire have
also been proposed as additions following European Commission objections
last week to 15 areas the British government wanted to include, said Mr
Wayne David, MEP for south Wales.
Mr David claimed parts of London and the south, including Great Yarmouth,
Southend, Dover, the Isle of Wight and Torbay were among currently
non-assisted places included on the draft map discussed last week by Mr Tim
Sainsbury, trade minister, and Mr Karel Van Miert, EC competition
commissioner.
Mr David, who is also vice-chairman of the European Parliament's regional
policy committee, said yesterday that he understood the government had since
'whittled down' the 15 to about six and added others.
The map is based on travel-to-work areas. Mr David said the draft map also
split up some of these areas - a precedent which is likely to be
controversial in non-assisted areas where the overall jobless rate masks
unemployment blackspots.
The long-awaited map, which entitles companies in qualifying areas to grant
aid, is expected to be made public next week.
Mr David attacked the government's proposed inclusion of south-coast areas.
He said: 'They are more concerned with the political nature of such actions
than responding to economic necessity.'
He claims that currently non-assisted areas that the government wanted
switched to full or intermediate status are Mansfield, Thanet, Folkestone,
Deal, Whitehaven, Ashfield, Isle of Wight, parts of London, Clacton,
Southend, Chesterfield, Hastings, Torbay, Pontefract, Harwich, Ilfracombe,
Great Yarmouth, Dover and Dewsbury.
Areas suggested to be upgraded from intermediate to full development status
are Fishguard, Forres, Haverfordwest, Kirkcaldy, Birmingham and
Wolverhampton.
Areas suggested to fall from full status to nothing are Corby, Lampeter and
Aberaeron.
Areas suggested to be downgraded from full status to intermediate are
Dundee, Cardigan, Shotton, Dumbarton, Neath and Port Talbot, Wrexham,
Pontypridd, Flint and Rhyl and Abergavenny. Areas suggested to fall from
intermediate status to nothing are Darlington, Newport, Doncaster, north
Cardiff, Telford and Bridgnorth, Rochdale.

FT  16 JUL 93 / Schools to have performance pay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN PATTEN, the education secretary, will be allowed to designate
schools in England and Wales as performance-related pay pilot schools, under
the School Teachers' Pay and Conditions Document published yesterday.
The paper confirmed government plans originally announced in April. The
National Union of Teachers, the UK's largest teaching union, has already
asked its members to boycott all appraisal interviews which form part of
pilot schemes.
The document also introduces a pay 'spine' for teachers in which points are
awarded for experience, extra responsibilities and 'excellence in classroom
teaching'. However, the government's intention to keep within the 1.5 per
cent public-sector pay norm is also confirmed.
The Association of Teachers and Lecturers said: 'The government in practice
is not prepared to reward excellence. It says it wants to, but fails to
deliver the financing.'
Both the association and the NAS/UWT teachers' union complained that the
late publication of the document, just as the summer term ends, placed an
unfair burden on schools' administration.
Mr Peter Smith, ATL general-secretary, said: 'The lateness of this report
presents real problems for schools. Severe difficulties could result.
Assimilation of teachers on to the new pay spine presents a particular
challenge for management in these rushed circumstances.'

FT  16 JUL 93 / MPs attack canteen arm of Treasury
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RACHEL JOHNSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TREASURY was yester-day attacked by MPs over irregularities in its
catering arm, ranging from mismanagement to fraud.
The breakdown of control and management of Forward Civil Service Catering -
which runs about 175 Whitehall canteens and restaurants - is estimated to
have cost the taxpayer between Pounds 500,000 and Pounds 1m. The
organisation is part of the Treasury, but run on commercial lines.
A report from the Commons public accounts committee yesterday declared the
case 'a serious failure in the proper conduct of public business in what is
 -or should have been - a straightforward trading operation'.
The fact that the 'shambles' - as one MP put it - was the responsibility of
the institution charged with monitoring financial control both in Whitehall
and nationwide made it 'particularly unsatisfactory'.
One MP said: 'You can understand why a taxpayer would wonder why we would
think the Treasury could manage the British economy when they cannot run a
tea shop.'
Forward, which is the in-house caterer to the bulk of Whitehall, has a
turnover of about Pounds 30m a year. It has its own chief executive and
management board. Its accounts for 1991-92 were qualified after a large
number of long-running irregularities came to light.
The latest report says the full financial consequences of such failures have
yet to be established.
To date the consequences comprise Pounds 400,000 lost due to failures in
cash handling, up to Pounds 450,000 liability for tax and national
insurance, and a Pounds 110,000 fee from accountants Ernst and Young.
The main weaknesses and irregularities found were:
Failures in cash handling and documentation systems.
Fictitious employees entered on the payroll.
Payments to casual employees made without deductions for PAYE and national
insurance.
Failures to comply with purchasing procedures since 1988 - 39 out of 43
contracts were rolled forward without re-tender or a search for
alternatives.
The person who placed Pounds 5m of contracts discussed with the companies
that benefited the financing of his private company.
Account records destroyed at four restaurants.
The Treasury admitted that it had failed to carry out a 10-year-old
recommendation to furnish Forward with proper commercial accounts.
MPs did not accept the Treasury's argument that uncertainties over Forward's
status and its possible privatisation were reasons for not equipping it with
efficient and effective financial systems and controls.
The committee demanded that the Treasury pursue 'vigorous' disciplinary
action against staff responsible for Forward's lapses. The report says
action has been taken against 15 Forward staff, but 'notes' the Treasury's
view that action against its own headquarters staff is not appropriate.

FT  16 JUL 93 / Big fall expected in BR pension surplus
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SURPLUS in British Rail's pension scheme is expected to have shrunk
dramatically when its actuarial valuation is completed this autumn, raising
questions about whether the scheme will be able to pay full pensions
indefinitely after privatisation.
The Pounds 8.5bn pool with about 130,000 contributing members was said to
have had a surplus of about Pounds 1bn at the time of its last valuation in
1990.
That surplus is expected to have shrunk by nearly two-thirds, reflecting the
effects of contributions holidays for BR, benefit enhancements for scheme
members, lower than expected dividend income, a switch into lower-risk
investments and the effects of the actuarial treatment of overseas
investments and agricultural properties.
Because of BR's redundancy programme, the scheme's investment managers have
been forced to switch to lower yielding but less risky instruments. The
scheme has moved roughly Pounds 1bn out of equities into fixed-interest
securities within the past year.
The government has proposed the scheme should operate for all BR employees
left in the industry after privatisation, with existing assets used to pay
their pensions and those of future pensioners. But trustees fear that
without a single employer behind the scheme, it will be necessary for the
government to provide a 'solvency' guarantee, to ensure benefits are paid.
Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, has promised the trustees of the BR
scheme, who include BR management and employees, that he will study their
solvency guarantee proposals.
Many UK pension schemes undergoing a triennial valuation this year are
reporting shrinkages in surpluses. Most actuaries have assumed dividend
growth of between 4 per cent and 5 per cent for the period just passed, and
dividend growth has been flat for the past 18 months.
British Telecommunications earlier this year reported that lower than
expected dividend growth and changes in the rate at which pension schemes
can reclaim advance corporation tax on dividends had cut its surplus this
year by nearly Pounds 1bn.

FT  16 JUL 93 / Government stops ferry merger
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S TWO biggest ferry operators, P&amp;O European Ferries and Stena
Sealink, were yesterday refused government permission to merge their
cross-Channel services in a bid to fight competition from the Channel
tunnel.
The two had planned to merge their car ferry services on the Dover to Calais
route into a single, high-frequency operation in readiness for the expected
opening of the tunnel next summer.
Mr Tim Sainsbury, minister of state for industry, said the government was
not prepared to contemplate a merger before the tunnel opened because this
would reduce competition.
He added that a fresh approach to the director-general of fair trading at a
later date would be welcome, but he would expect any application to depend
on new information such as traffic data. 'I would not expect such
information to become available before autumn 1994,' he said.
The ferry companies, which face a slump in business on the Dover-Calais
route when the Channel tunnel opens, believe their best chance of surviving
the competition is to co-ordinate timetables, prices and booking systems and
to rationalise capacity on the ferry route.
This is the third time since 1989 that the companies have been refused
permission to pool their services. They said they were bitterly disappointed
at the decision.
Mr Sainsbury said yesterday that he would ask the director-general of fair
trading if there was scope for restricted collaboration on interchangeable
tickets, timetabling or capacity reduction.
But Lord Sterling, chairman of P&amp;O, said the decision 'defied rational
explanation'.

FT  16 JUL 93 / Birt admits BBC morale is low
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN BIRT, BBC director-general, admitted yesterday that staff morale was
low. The most difficult task management faced was to unite staff behind the
painful structural reforms being pushed through, he said.
Mr Birt has said that he expects staff questionnaires, published today, to
make painful reading. It is believed the questionnaires show considerable
staff loyalty to the BBC, but much greater criticism of senior management.

FT  16 JUL 93 / Chevron to cut N Sea exploring
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
CHEVRON, one of the leading US operators in the North Sea, will cut its
exploration budget by 30 per cent over the rest of this year because of the
effects of proposed changes to the petroleum revenue tax.
Mr Charles Smith, managing director of Chevron UK, yesterday said the
company's annual budget for North Sea exploration was between Pounds 50m and
Pounds 100m. 'We'll have to slow it down to meet our cash flow targets,' he
said.
The changes to the tax, proposed in the March Budget, give oil companies
greater incentives to invest in existing fields, but they reduce tax
allowances for exploration.
Chevron also said yesterday that it would shortly be entering final
negotiations to sell gas from its new Britannia field, the largest of its
kind in the North Sea. The likely purchasers are either British Gas or
Wintershall of Germany. Delivery will start in October 1997.

THE TWO biggest Civil Service unions, the CPSA and NUCPS will today hold
their first ever Home-Office-wide one-day strike against what they see as
the threat to services and jobs by market testing and the lack of assurances
for the future of staff.
Ballot results showed a 2:1 majority in favour of the one-day strike by both
unions' members.
The strike will involve immigration staff at airports and ports, some prison
workers and passport office workers.

FT  16 JUL 93 / North sees continued increase in sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO OF the biggest regional economic surveys carried out by chambers of
commerce - covering more than 2,000 companies in north-west England and the
Yorkshire and Humberside region - have given further evidence of economic
recovery, Ian Hamilton Fazey writes.
Both reported that domestic and export sales had continued to rise after
'more tenuous' increases in January and March.
The nine north-west chambers said domestic sales and orders, especially for
smaller companies, had strengthened further. Yet they cautioned that orders
from mainland Europe were slowing, although exports generally remained
'quite buoyant'.
Companies in north-west England, however, are still reporting little
pressure on capacity, which remains under-utilised. This is contributing to
continuing caution on new investment.
There also appears to be continuing disparity in job markets, with small-
and medium-sized companies responding quickly to the upturn by increasing
recruitment, while larger manufacturers are continuing to shed labour.
In Yorkshire and Humberside, 47 per cent of manufacturers are attempting to
recruit, compared with 39 per cent in the first quarter. The respective
figures in the service sector are 42 per cent and 36 per cent.
Confidence on both sides of the Pennines was reported at its highest for two
years. Yet companies are worried about financial stability and any
tightening of conditions as sterling appreciates.

FT  16 JUL 93 / Employment Service threat to bonuses denied: Hunt dismisses
union allegations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR DAVID HUNT, employ-ment secretary, yesterday denied claims by Civil
Service unions that the Employment Service, a government agency, was
threatening to withhold bonuses from staff if they did not meet targets for
reducing unemployment totals.
Among reasons suggested for the fall in unemployment during the past five
months is that the government has fiddled the figures through the service,
which runs Jobcentres and Unemployment Benefit Offices.
Mr John Hickey, national secretary of the CPSA, one of the two main civil
service unions, suggested on Wednesday that new pay arrangements were
forcing staff to cut corners to achieve national targets, which include
ensuring that 9 per cent of initial claim inquiries should not be pursued as
new claims.
Mr Ian Taylor, national officer at the NUCPS, the other civil main service
union, denied that his members were fiddling the system, but said the new
pay system, which includes performance pay, put pressure on staff to achieve
what he believed to be 'unrealistic and unnecessary targets'.
Mr Hunt said: 'The Employment Service has targets to help people out of
unemployment. That means helping them to find jobs, helping them on to
training courses or, in some cases, helping them on to a more appropriate
benefit. There is nothing wrong in that.
'Like other parts of the Civil Service, the ES rewards its staff for overall
performance - everything from good timekeeping to accuracy. It is plain
wrong to suggest this means showing unemployed people the door.'
The ES said there was no specific linkage between achievement of a specific
target and the judgment for overall performance, which included the quality
of handling clients and understanding the labour market.
The only point at which bonuses were paid was when people hit the top of
their pay scale.

FT  16 JUL 93 / Pay rises at lowest level for 26 years: Average earnings up
3.75%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AVERAGE earnings across the economy rose an underlying 3.75 per cent in the
year to May, the lowest figure for 26 years.
In a further sign of low inflation, wages per unit of output in
manufacturing in the three months to May declined 3.6 per cent compared with
the same period last year. This is the biggest year-on-year fall since the
Department of Employment started records in 1970.
Due to low wage increases and substantial rises in output, production per
employee in manufacturing increased 8.7 per cent between March and May on
the same period last year. The employee production figure was last bettered
at the end of 1986.
The year-on-year rise in the index of earnings for all economic sectors has
come down substantially from 7 per cent in April last year. The figures are
seasonally adjusted and also take out erratic influences such as delays in
the payment of wages.
In November the rise in the index was 5 per cent, while in April it was 4
per cent.
Average earnings have fallen particularly sharply in service industries, for
which the year-on-year increase was 3 per cent in May, after a revised 3.25
per cent the previous month. In manufacturing the equivalent figure was 5
per cent in both months.
In June last year, average earnings in both sectors rose 6.25 per cent
compared with the equivalent month a year previously.
In a sign of improved demand in manufacturing, an average of 9.75m hours per
week of overtime were worked in May, an increase of 1.45m hours on April.
This was the highest overtime figure since July last year.
New job vacancies recorded at government Jobcentres rose a seasonally
adjusted 183,900 in June, the highest monthly rise for 2 1/2 years.
This may be a sign that employers are trying harder to recruit people.
Jobcentres are thought to be notified of about a third of all job openings.

FT  16 JUL 93 / Builders squeezed on both sides: Construction groups which
bid low for tenders now face higher material costs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CHAIRMAN of a publicly quoted British construction group with a turnover
of several hundred million pounds has this week explained why his company is
prepared to take contracts for no profit or even at a loss.
The aim, he says, is to uncover projects with ill-defined designs which
could require changes to plans and specification before work is completed.
The company bidding for such a contract could put in an exceedingly low
tender to win the job, confident that it would be able to charge extra and
make a profit from the variations.
The practice is not uncommon in the construction industry, but has become
more widespread, says the contractor, as hard-pressed businesses have sought
to boost declining order books and generate cash from contract progress
payments to reduce large property borrowings.
The practice has not prevented many contractors and sub-contractors from
going out of business - indeed tender prices have tumbled to their lowest
level since 1986.
Contractors are now facing a double squeeze. Building material prices, which
fell steeply during the early 1990s, have recently begun to rise again.
And construction companies which have won long-term contracts at fixed
prices will have to meet the extra costs out of contract prices which
already assume little or no margin for profit.
The building cost information service of the Royal Institution of Chartered
Surveyors revealed this week that contractors' tender prices, which have
fallen by a quarter since 1989 and are at their lowest level since 1986,
have declined by a further 3 per cent in the first three months of this
year.
It says cut-throat competition among builders is forcing prices down to
suicidal levels. 'Work levels will not allow tender prices to rise until
late 1994 and, with pressure on supply and sub-contract costs, it is
difficult to see how some companies will cope,' the institution warns.
Even contracts which have arrangements to compensate builders for higher
material prices may not provide an adequate safety net, says EC Harris,
international construction cost consultants.
This is because most agreements are based on suppliers' list prices and take
no account of discounts and special deals which may be offered to
contractors, depending on their purchasing power and payment record.
Client payments might take account of increases in list prices but do not
compensate for loss of discounts which may have been eroded as material
producers seek to regain lost margins, according to EC Harris.
A study by the consultants of 'real' price increases by material producers,
including reduction in discounts, reveals immense differences in prices
offered to contractors. As a basis for the study the consultants considered
the construction of a modest 20,000 sq ft office block in central London
costing about Pounds 2m.
Results show that material prices for an equivalent development would have
risen on average by 5.2 per cent in the past 12 months.
This increase, however, disguises the diversity of prices offered to
contractors for the same building material. Prices for 32mm steel
reinforcement, according to the EC Harris sample, have varied recently from
Pounds 295 a tonne to Pounds 460 a tonne, the difference between a
standstill in price since June last year and a 38 per cent increase. The
average increase in reinforcement over the same period has been 24 per cent.
Increases in 12.7mm plasterboard, after discounts, have ranged between 7.1
per cent and 26.2 per cent - a difference in price of Pounds 1.15 per sq m
and Pounds 1.75 per sq m.
The average price increase for plasterboard has been 13.7 per cent.
Average ready-mix concrete prices for a central London development (prices
vary regionally as well as from customer to customer) have risen by 5.8 per
cent since June last year say the consultants; structural steelwork prices
have risen by 10.5 per cent; clay bricks 7 per cent; concrete blocks 6.1 per
cent and copper pipe 10 per cent.
By comparison, prices of aluminium curtain walling, a common cladding around
office buildings, and air conditioning prices have remained unchanged from
the low level of 12 months ago.
The reasons why building material producers are able to raise prices while
contractors are implementing reductions reflects the great difference
between two sectors.
Contracting is a low capital intensive business relying on the skills of its
people rather than its assets. It remains a highly fragmented, competitive
industry.
But the capital investment to produce building material is far higher - a
new cement works can cost more than Pounds 100m. The number of competing
players in production also tends to be smaller, making it easier to hike
prices.
The devaluation of sterling has also made it more difficult for overseas
competitors to undercut UK prices.
Contractors bearing the brunt of increases will have to suffer until they
are able to raise customer prices or pass the pain on to subcontractors.
Specialist subcontractors are already complaining that the main contractors,
instead of passing on progress payments to subcontractors, are hanging on to
the money for as long as possible.
Most contracts, they say, require subcontractors to be paid within 28 days
of submitting an invoice. According to one structural steel supplier, its
average waiting period for payment has been 50 days after submitting
invoices. It adds that a wait of several months for payments is not uncommon
and during this time there is always the risk that the main contractor or
final client might go out of business.
Main contractors and sub-contractors also complain about abuse of contract
clauses which allow clients to retain some of the money owed to contractors,
sometimes for several years, as insurance against defects emerging once work
is completed.
Construction remains a very tough business.

FT  16 JUL 93 / Hard labour in Bridgend to get people into jobs: Staff at a
south Wales Jobcentre assure Lisa Wood that the figures are not being
fiddled  - it is their efforts that are producing results
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNEMPLOYMENT is falling and it is not as a result of the figures being
fiddled, says Jobcentre manager Mrs Fay Evans.
Mrs Evans, who works in Bridgend, south Wales, says hard work by her staff
is helping to get more people into jobs.
'We are not fiddling any figures,' she says. 'We are doing our job better.'
The Jobcentre and its sister organisation the Unemployment Benefits Office -
where unemployed people sign on - must meet strict national targets.
At local level they replicate the targets agreed between the Employment
Service - which runs Jobcentres and Unemployment Benefit Offices - and the
government.
The targets, which have become more ambitious in the past two years, include
placing 1.47m people into jobs this year, of which 27 per cent must be
long-term unemployed.
Staff must also weed out benefit fraud and check that people are entitled to
unemployment benefit. Nationally, the government wants the Employment
Service to refuse 9 per cent of applications.
Bridgend Jobcentre recommends that the benefits of a small number of people
be suspended because these individuals are not prepared to consider jobs
which do not pay enough.
Mrs Evans says: 'Ministers are very keen that we apply the rules, such as
whether people are actively seeking work. That can include widening job
searches and lowering expectations.'
Last year Bridgend met some
of its targets. This year some are tougher, which concerns Mrs Evans because
her performance will be partly judged on meeting them.
Her area manager, Mr Dewi Miles, will be one of her assessors. Mr Miles,
however, says it would be over-simplistic if staff recommended particular
actions, such as suspending benefit, because there was a financial
incentive.
'We do not show people the door because we are afraid that bonuses may be
withheld,' says Mr Miles. 'A manager is judged on the ability to do a whole
job effectively.' Performance pay is awarded on overall performance. But
failure to achieve one of a number of objectives would not necessarily
affect performance pay.
Mrs Evans says there are several reasons why unemployment has fallen in
Bridgend.
'There are lots of reasons for the trend, such as companies in our area not
laying people off any more and a few, very cautiously, recruiting again.'
But she adds that her Jobcentre and the nearby Unemployment Benefit Office
play an important part.
She gives other reasons for the improved outlook for jobs in Bridgend. Her
centre now attracts more vacancies from local employers than in the past.
It also matches local unemployed people more quickly into jobs, particularly
those aged 18 to 24 for whom it has a drop-in counselling service. Last year
the centre aimed to place 570 long-term unemployed adults in work. It
exceeded the target and this year the aim is 787 placements.
So how are Employment Service staff more effectively removing people from
the unemployment total and into jobs or training?
Structural changes: Jobcentres and Unemployment Benefit Offices are moving
to single sites, which helps staff direct those signing on to work
opportunities. Policy shifts: Until recently Jobcentres were discouraged
from actively seeking vacancies from employers because this brought them
into competition with private job agencies. They are now allowed to do this,
although ministers are reluctant to let them advertise their services for
the recruitment of unemployed executives and professionals. Mrs Evans says
she had received no complaints from local private agencies, and had directed
some unemployed people in their direction.
Jobcentres, which offer free services, can also arrange tailor-made training
for businesses coming into an area, and draw up short lists of suitable
applicants for employers.
Changes in the law: Legislation introduced in 1989 requires the unemployed
to be 'actively seeking' work. After 13 weeks an unemployed person can be
called into a Jobcentre and asked to consider other types of job. Improved
staff recruitment and training: Staff used to be recruited on academic
ability. They are now taken on for their competence to do the job, including
good communication skills.

FT  16 JUL 93 / Strangeways team beats private-sector bids
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE REBUILT Strangeways Prison in Manchester will be managed by a
public-sector in-house team that yesterday beat six private-sector companies
in competitive tendering to run the jail.
Strangeways - seriously damaged in Britain's worst prison riots three years
ago - was the first example of public and private sectors competing for a
prison management contract.
Mr Derek Lewis, director-general of the Prison Service, announced yesterday
that the Pounds 79m five-year contract would go to the in-house team led by
Mr Robin Halward, the governor. The public-sector bid, said Mr Lewis, was a
'strong and imaginative proposal which offered the best overall value for
money'.
All seven bids were scrutinised by an evaluation panel chaired by Mr Peter
Chapman, a Home Office official. Four were rejected - one on cost grounds
and three because of doubts about ability to deliver the contract. Mr
Chapman said the decision to recommend acceptance of the in-house bid from
the shortlisted three was reached by a majority vote.
Ministers are pledged to developing private-sector involvement in the
criminal justice system, but will not be unhappy about the outcome at
Strangeways.
In order to win the bid Strangeways staff have made a variety of concessions
on working arrangements, including accepting a procedural agreement that
restricts their right to take industrial action.
Such developments at local level will be seen as a means of eroding the
traditionally tough industrial relations stance taken nationally by the
Prison Officers' Association, the service's main union.
One of the final three bidders was Group 4, the private security company
that runs Wolds Remand Prison, Humberside, and prisoner escort services in
the east Midlands and Yorkshire region. Mr Jim Harrower, its managing
director, said: 'I am delighted that the public sector has won - that is
what competition is about. I welcome the POA to the prison privatisation
programme.'
Mr Lewis said the spur of competition had generated bids which represented
levels of performance and value for money not previously seen. The outcome
provided proof of the capability of the Prison Service. He added that the
private sector should not be discouraged, as it had been a close-run thing.
The public-sector bid is based on staffing levels of 450 - compared with 523
under the old regime - although the new Strangeways will house fewer
prisoners.
Financially, the bid envisages a cost structure of Pounds 350 per prisoner
week, compared with a national average of Pounds 437 in 1991-92. It provides
for prisoners spending up to 14 hours a day out of their cells with
full-time work, education and training programmes.

FT  16 JUL 93 / South-east jobless reap rewards of recovery: Unemployment
falls in most regions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOUTH-EAST England exclu-ding London has been the greatest beneficiary of
the fall in unemployment since January - supporting indications that the
region, one of those hit hardest by the recession, has been among the first
to experience recovery.
Unemployment in the south-east outside London dropped 4.6 per cent in the
five months to June - well above the overall fall for the UK of 2.8 per
cent.
The south-west experienced the next biggest fall in seasonally adjusted
unemployment over this period with a drop of 4.3 per cent.
Last month was the fifth in succession to record a fall in the number of
people out of work and claiming benefit for the UK as a whole. The figure
fell 7,600 to 2,909,200, after a drop of 23,100 in May.
Joblessness as a proportion of the available workforce stood at 10.4 per
cent in June. Unadjusted for seasonal variations, unemployment fell 51,600
in June to 2,865,000.
Most regions recorded falls in unemployment last month, with the exceptions
being East Anglia, northern England, Wales and Northern Ireland.
Of the 7,600 reduction in total unemployment nearly half was accounted for
by the south-east, including London, where the figure fell by 3,700 to
927,800.
In contrast, more people in northern England were out of work last month
than in May, with the figure rising 1,700 to 169,900.
The region has an unemployment rate of 12.2 per cent, the highest for the UK
apart from Northern Ireland, which has a comparable figure of 13.9 per cent.
Out of the cumulative 83,100 fall in UK unemployment since January, the
figure for the south-east excluding London has dropped 22,300 to 457,500. In
the south-west, the number out of work has fallen 9,800 to 217,200.
Other regions that have seen falls in unemployment of 3 per cent or more
over the period are the east and west Midlands, north-west England,
Yorkshire and Humberside, East Anglia and Wales.
Regions with a fall below this figure include London with a muted fall of
0.3 per cent between January and June, while northern England bucked the
trend with a 1.1 per cent rise in the numbers without jobs. Scotland and
Northern Ireland recorded falls in unemployment of just over 2 per cent.

FT  16 JUL 93 / Election likely as Bhutto calls off protest

<TEXT>
PAKISTAN'S opposition parties last night called off a planned 'long march'
today against Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's government, giving rise to
speculation that an early election will be called.
Ms Benazir Bhutto, the opposition leader, had planned to lead tens of
thousands of supporters on the march to Islamabad to try to force Mr Sharif
to call the poll.
The plan for the demonstration had set the two sides on a collision course
and paramilitary police were on standby in the capital.
The decision to call off the march was apparently made as part of an
army-backed package, senior aides to Ms Bhutto said. It came after she flew
to Islamabad from Lahore yesterday to meet General Abdul Waheed Kakar,
Pakistan's chief of army staff.
Ms Bhutto said she had 'postponed' the march at the army's request in the
national interest.
Pakistan's political crisis was triggered in April when Mr Sharif's
government was sacked by President Ghulam Ishaq Khan. With the government
then returned by order of a court, there has been intensifying political
confrontation.
The opposition parties were widely believed to have gathered around Mr Khan
in his tussle with Mr Sharif.
In the past few days, Gen Kakar is understood to have been involved in
hectic efforts to negotiate a settlement.
Although no details of the formula were available last night, a government
minister conceded that an early election was part of the deal.
However, Mr Khan's future was not clear. Mr Sharif has insisted repeatedly
Mr Khan must quit before an election to ensure the poll is not rigged.
Last night's developments appeared to have created a new opportunity for
politicians to prevent a total collapse of negotiations, which could have
given way to street violence involving opposite groups.

FT  16 JUL 93 / UN threat of Unita arms ban
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL LITTLEJOHNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UN Security Council last night threatened comprehensive sanctions,
including an arms embargo, against Unita rebels in Angola unless they lay
down their arms within two months and abide by a peace accord.
The unanimous resolution was the first such measure against an insurgent
movement seeking by force to topple the government of a UN member state.
South Africa and Zaire have both been accused of backing Unita, which is led
by Mr Jonas Savimbi.
The Security Council reiterated its demand that Unita accept unreservedly
the results of last year's UN-supervised elections, rejected as fraudulent
by Mr Savimbi. It also renewed until September 15 the mandate of the small
UN observer force.

FT  16 JUL 93 / UN holds out hope for Iraqi weapons backdown
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON and DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SENIOR United Nations diplomat arrived in Baghdad for talks with Iraqi
officials yesterday, holding out the prospect of lifting crippling economic
sanctions if Iraq accepts long-term monitoring of its weapons programmes.
Mr Rolf Ekeus, head of the UN special commission into Iraq's weapons of mass
destruction, went into a two-hour meeting at the foreign ministry and later
said talks would continue today.
He is expected to spend four days in Baghdad trying to resolve the stand-off
between the UN and Iraq over installation of monitoring cameras at two
missile test sites. Two teams of UN inspectors have failed to persuade Iraq
to mount cameras at the sites, or seal monitoring equipment there as an
interim measure.
Failure to defuse the crisis would re-open the possibility of a UN-backed
military strike against the sites.
But Mr Ekeus' visit comes amid signs that Iraq is anxious to win an easing
of economic sanctions, which have prevented Iraqi export sales, particularly
of oil, for almost four years.
Mr Ekeus and fellow diplomats at the UN believe Iraq's pressing economic
needs could force authorities in Baghdad to back down in the present
confrontation. 'The major carrot (for Iraqi compliance) is the ongoing
sanctions and the oil embargo,' Mr Ekeus said before arriving in Baghdad.
Parallel talks in New York between Iraqi Oil Ministry officials and UN legal
experts on a special six-month sale of oil worth Dollars 1.6bn (Pounds
1.06bn) were suspended on Wednesday as Iraqi officials considered a possible
draft agreement on the sale. Confidentiality surrounding the
market-sensitive talks has made it difficult to assess their success, but UN
diplomats said agreement might be close.
About 60 per cent of the revenues from the oil sale, which would add about
500,000 barrels of crude a day to the market, would be set aside for food
and medicines in Iraq, distributed and monitored by the UN. The rest would
help pay for UN activities in Iraq.
Deborah Hargreaves adds: Oil prices dropped to a three-year low in London
and New York as traders fear the resumption of even limited Iraqi oil
exports could add to the surplus on world markets, leading to a collapse in
prices.

FT  16 JUL 93 / Italians calm row over role in Somalia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE Italian government yesterday sought to calm the row over the role of its
2,600-strong peacekeeping contingent with the United Nations in Somalia.
In an effort to restore a dialogue, Italian diplomats will meet
representatives of the UN and the US State Department in Mogadishu, the
Somali capital, today. A senior official will also go to New York in the
next few days.
'We must try to lower the temperature of the argument as soon as possible,'
Mr Beniamino Andreatta, the Italian foreign minister, told parliament.
He said he had been in close contact with Mr Warren Christopher, his US
opposite number, in an attempt to defuse tension over Italy's criticism of
US military tactics in Somalia.
'We are in Somalia and wish to remain there,' Mr Andreatta added. 'We are
well aware that one has to shoot and use force. But it is still the
sovereign right of a government to have differences of view on these
issues.'
It is the first time in recent years Italy has been in such open
disagreement with allies and an international body such as the UN. The row
led Mr Kofi Annan, in charge of all UN peacekeeping operations, to call for
removal of General Bruno Loi, the Italian commander, for defying UN orders.
The Italian government replied by giving full backing to Gen Loi and
threatening to pull out of Somalia.
As a gesture of support for Gen Loi, it was announced yesterday he would be
visited by Gen Mario Buscemi, deputy chief of staff.
The UN yesterday sought to patch up its strained relations with Italy but
still insisted on the removal of Gen Loi. Mr Joe Sills, a UN spokesman said
that he understood Gen Loi would leave 'fairly quickly'.
Mr Sills also confirmed that the Italian peacekeepers could be redeployed
away from Mogadishu as soon as replacements were assembled.

FT  16 JUL 93 / Japanese Elections: A son of Tokyo appeals to voters'
sympathy - Family reputation may not be enough to save Ishihara junior
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NOBUTERU Ishihara, a young candidate from the Liberal Democratic party, is
appealing to to voters' compassion rather than convictions in the last days
of his campaign to allow him to remain a member of the House of
Representatives.
At 36 - he is the youngest running on the LDP ticket in Tokyo - Mr Ishihara
has more going for him than most of his rivals when it comes to appealing to
the hearts of the electorate. Yet he is struggling.
He is the son of a famous and popular politician, Mr Shintaro Ishihara, a
former transport minister. Mr Ishihara senior shocked the world but enthused
Japanese with his outspoken views in The Japan That Can Say No, a book
co-authored with Mr Akio Morita, the founder-chairman of Sony.
Just as important in winning the sympathy vote, perhaps, is the memory of
his late uncle, Mr Yujiro Ishihara, a legendary actor whose movies still
regularly draw the crowds.
As the general election on Sunday draws near, Mr Ishihara, who is battling
for political survival in one of the country's most hotly-contested
constituencies, is making a final plea to voters to let him keep his seat.
'There are only three days left, and I need your help,' he called out to the
small but enthusiastic audience that has gathered in front of Eifuku-cho
station, a residential district in western Tokyo.
His desperation is palpable. Although he was elected 3 1/2 years ago with
the highest number of votes in the district, the polls say Mr Ishihara is
running sixth out of 12 candidates competing for five seats. Among those
ahead of him are an older LDP candidate who has a popular following, a
candidate in the Komeito who has the support of Soka Gakkai, a religious
order, and a 35-year-old member of the Japan New Party.
His actor uncle passed away seven years ago, but Mr Ishihara was able to
enlist the support of his aunt, Yujiro's wife Mie Takahara, herself once a
famous actress.
'My husband loved Nobuteru as if he were his own son,' Ms Takahara
reminisced through the microphone as elderly women nodded in approval.
'Nobuteru's mother calls me every day and asks me to support him because he
is in trouble. Please call your friends, anyone you meet on the street. We
need your help,' she pleaded.
That Mr Ishihara is having to rely on such emotional appeals is a sign of
his plight in spite of a record which shows that he is just the kind of new
conservative many voters are looking for.
With a 10-year career as a television journalist, and an ostensibly
faultless track record as a member of the Diet, Mr Ishihara speaks the voice
of the politically informed, urban middle class.
His views on political and tax reform, his calls for the need to deregulate
Japan's markets and to debate openly the liberalisation of the rice market
strike a markedly different chord from the traditional rhetoric of LDP
diehards who have either opposed any change or shied away from facing those
issues and clung to power on a cosy votes-for-favours arrangement with their
constituencies in rural Japan.
On political reform, the issue highest on voters minds, he reminds his
audience that the aim of reform is to do away with money politics and not
just to revise the electoral system.
'Everyone talks about political reform but what do they mean? Politics
should not be based on a mood,' Mr Ishihara says, suggesting that his rival
candidates from the new parties are merely riding on a wave of enthusiasm
for political reform.
He accuses them of having no political ideology to support their claims of
being the country's best chance to reform a political system that breeds
corruption.
Neither is Mr Ishihara shy to criticise the LDP, the party to which he has
chosen to belong. 'The LDP may be bad. Mr (Kiichi) Miyazawa (the prime
minister) may be a liar, but now is the time to reform politics from
within,' he says.
Mr Ishihara's outspoken views on the need to reduce the tax burden on those
who work the hardest and pay the most, his call for a change in policies to
enable a lifestyle that reflects the economic status of Japan, and his
flexible view on rice liberalisation should be attractive to the people of
Suginami, Nakano and Shibuya, the three wards which comprise the
constituency.
The district has a relatively young population, with about 20 per cent of
residents in their 20s, and is known to be one of the more politically aware
constituencies in the country.
Many residents are salaried workers, living in rented accommodation.
So in theory, Mr Ishihara's calls for tax reform and for market deregulation
to bring down Tokyo's prices - the highest in the world - should win the
minds, of many.
'Unlike most politicians he has been willing to spell out what his policies
are and that is rare. I hope he wins,' said a young housewife listening to
Mr Ishihara.
The difficulty Mr Ishihara faces is that the constituency is also known for
being fickle in its political choices. The young population means that voter
turnover is relatively high and the district tends to vote in line with the
prevailing trend of the day.
In the elections for the Tokyo metropolitan assembly earlier this month, for
example, Suginami ward alone voted in two candidates from the increasingly
popular Japan New party.
In the last general election, when the popularity of the Social Democratic
party was riding high as voters turned against the LDP in anger over the
introduction of a consumption tax, the district sent two SDP members to the
Lower House.
Mr Ishihara is counting on this to reverse his fortunes. But his decision to
stay in the LDP, on the grounds that reform is now possible from within and
that to splinter off as some former LDP members have done is irresponsible,
is his biggest gamble.

FT  16 JUL 93 / Italians calm row over role in Somalia

<TEXT>
THE Italian government yesterday sought to calm the row over the role of its
2,600-strong peacekeeping contingent with the United Nations in Somalia.
In an effort to restore a dialogue, Italian diplomats will meet
representatives of the UN and the US State Department in Mogadishu, the
Somali capital, today. 'We must try to lower the temperature of the argument
as soon as possible,' Mr Beniamino Andreatta, the Italian foreign minister,
told parliament.
Mr Andreatta disclosed he had been in close contact with Mr Warren
Christopher, his US opposite number, in an attempt to defuse tension over
Italy's criticism of US military 'enforcement' tactics in Somalia. He said
Mr Christopher had written him a 'friendly' letter yesterday.
'We are in Somalia and wish to remain there,' Mr Andreatta added. 'We are
well aware that one has to shoot and use force. But it is still the
sovereign right of a government to have differences of view on these
issues.'
It is the first time in recent years Italy has been in such open
disagreement with allies and an international body such as the UN. The
Mogadishu meeting follows two days of increasing tension between Italy and
other members of the UN force in Somalia, headed by General Civek Bir, the
Turkish commander, over the way the peacekeeping operation has moved towards
peace enforcement.
The row led Mr Kofi Annan, in charge of all UN peacekeeping operations, to
call for removal of General Bruno Loi, the Italian commander, for defying UN
orders. The Italian government replied by giving full backing to Gen Loi and
threatening to pull out of Somalia.
As a gesture of support for Gen Loi, it was announced yesterday he would be
visited by Gen Mario Buscemi, deputy chief of staff. This suggests the
Italian government will strongly resist the UN call for Gen Loi's early
removal. Italian officials insisted such a decision anyway rested with them,
not the UN.
Despite the effort to improve relations, there was little evidence that
differences between Italy and the UN had narrowed.
The Italian military in Mogadishu and the Italian government believe the UN
mission in Somalia has moved down a dangerous path, by relying on military
muscle and by shedding impartiality to brand Gen Mohamed Farah Aideed, the
main Somali warlord, as an outlaw.
Mr Andreatta said sending in US helicopter gunships to attack and perhaps
capture the warlord was the equivalent of the British bombarding Belfast to
arrest an IRA leader.

FT  16 JUL 93 / Japanese slowdown fuels trade surplus
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S trade surplus for the first half of the year rose 17.6 per cent to
Dollars 57.3bn (Pounds 38.7bn) from a year earlier, as the yen's
appreciation pushed export prices higher and the domestic economic slowdown
blunted import demand.
There are signs the yen's rapid appreciation has begun to influence trade
patterns.
The volume of exports rose only 1.2 per cent in June, although the value of
the trade surplus for the month rose 11.3 per cent compared with last year,
to Dollars 9.97bn.
The politically sensitive bilateral surplus with the US is still rising.
For the first half, exports to the US were 10.6 per cent higher at Dollars
49.5bn, while imports rose 5.9 per cent to Dollars 27.9bn. Japanese
motorcycle exports to the US increased 36 per cent, and semiconductor
exports were 28 per cent higher, reflecting growth in demand from the US
computer industry.
Exports to the US in June rose 10.5 per cent to Dollars 8.4bn, while imports
were 13.1 per cent higher at Dollars 5.0bn.
During the first half, Japan's exports to the EC fell 8 per cent, while
imports slipped 5.1 per cent. There was a 51.2 per cent increase in exports
to China during the period; China is now Japan's second largest trading
partner, surpassing South Korea and Taiwan.
Exports during June rose 8.4 per cent to Dollars 28.1bn, while imports
during the month were 7 per cent higher at Dollars 19.2bn. The seasonally
adjusted surplus for the month was Dollars 8.69bn, down from Dollars 10.09bn
in May.
Electric machinery exports rose 14.5 per cent during June and ordinary
machinery by 11.1 per cent. Imports of foodstuffs climbed by 9.2 per cent
and those of materials by 12.6 per cent. Machinery imports rose 11.8 per
cent.
Japan's reliance on Asian markets is continuing to grow. Mr Kenneth Courtis,
senior economist at Deutsche Bank Capital Markets Asia, said the Asian share
of Japan's exports rose from 22 per cent in 1985 to 40 per cent this year
and is likely to be close to 45 per cent by 1995.
Trade with South Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Singapore during the half
totalled Dollars 51.6bn, while that with the EC was Dollars 44.3bn. Exports
and imports to the UK were down 4.4 and 2.7 per cent respectively.
Fluctuations in Japan's trade with most of its partners are dwarfed by those
with an overheated China.
Exports of cars to China rose six times during the half, television camera
exports increased more than fourfold, steel exports doubled, as did those of
communic-ations equipment, motor-cycles, and construction materials.

FT  16 JUL 93 / Polls say 43% of voters undecided
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE most striking characteristic of Japanese public opinion polls is an
unusually high percentage of respondents who either 'don't know' or 'cannot
say', a pattern repeated in the final flurry of pre-election polls conducted
by Japanese newspapers, Robert Thomson reports from Tokyo.
By the reckoning of one newspaper, the Asahi Shimbun, 43 per cent of voters
are still undecided, creating great potential for deviation from the
generally consistent findings that the ruling Liberal Democratic party will
take 220 to 230 of the 511 seats and that the Social Democratic party, the
largest opposition party, will be decimated.
It appears from opinion poll results that two of the relatively new parties,
the Japan Renewal party, formed by Mr Tsutomu Hata, the former finance
minister, and the Japan New Party of Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, a former
provincial governor, have the longer-term potential to provide competition
to the LDP.
However, this time round, both parties, particularly the JNP, are stealing
opinion poll percentage from the SDP, which has traditionally received the
protest vote from disgruntled Japanese.
One point of discussion among Japanese political analysts is whether the SDP
does better than predicted by the polls, as its forecast fall from the
present 134 seats to as few as 60 seats, may prompt some sympathetic voters
to come to its rescue on Sunday.
The greatest obstacle faced by the new parties has not been convincing
voters that they are an alternative, at least to the SDP if not the LDP, but
in mustering enough candidates for the election.
The JNP has only 57, the JRP 69, and the New Party Harbinger, another LDP
splinter group, a mere 16.

FT  16 JUL 93 / Store sales highlight declining consumption
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DEPARTMENT store sales in Tokyo fell by a record 13.4 per cent in June,
against a year earlier, highlighting the continuing decline in personal
consumption that is dragging down the Japanese economy.
The fall was the largest since the Japan Department Stores' Association
began compiling monthly figures.
It partly reflected cost-cutting at Japanese companies, which traditionally
buy presents for clients at this time of year.
Clothing sales were down 11.6 per cent, while household goods slipped by
14.7 per cent, personal accessories by 9.4 per cent, and food by 8.1 per
cent.
The decline in personal spending has prompted calls from business leaders
for a cut in official interest rates or income tax.
Japanese companies are still under pressure. Corporate bankruptcies rose 3.7
per cent in the first half, with bankruptcies linked to the eco-nomic
downturn rising 40 per cent during the period, according to Teikoku Data
Bank, a credit research agency.
Failures linked to speculative excess during the late 1980s are in decline,
which is one reason for an 11.1 per cent fall in the amount of liabilities
left by bankrupt companies.
In June the number of failures fell 2.6 per cent to 1,140, while liabilities
rose 23.8 per cent.
Wholesale prices in June were 0.5 per cent lower than in the previous month,
with import prices down 2.4 per cent.
The Bank of Japan said this was a direct result of the yen's appreciation in
recent months.
The wholesale price index was 3.2 per cent lower, compared to a year
earlier. The export price index fell 10.6 per cent and the import price
index was down 10.5 per cent.

THE US embassy in New Delhi has asked the Karnataka state government to take
'swift and expedient action' against farmers who attacked the Cargill Seeds
factory in the state on Monday.
Embassy officials believe the attack against the US multinational, the
second this year, could have ominous consequences for foreign investment in
India.
The American Business Council, to which all the leading US companies in
India belong, has also expressed 'great concern' about the security of
foreign investors in India.
Mr Veerappa Moily, the Karnataka chief minister, has condemned the attack.
The farmers fear multinationals may try to patent traditional seeds and
enforce the patents under the rules of the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade.
Mr Moily said his state's industrial liberalisation policy had been welcomed
by investors and would create 20m jobs in the next seven years.

PARAMILITARY troops were on standby in Islamabad, the Pakistani capital,
yesterday, as the government of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif prepared for a
'long march' by the opposition today which is aimed at forcing him to call
fresh elections, writes Farhan Bokhari in Islamabad.
At least 60 police trucks and buses carrying riot policemen wearing helmets
and armed with tear gas and batons, drove past the parliament building in a
show of force.
Some officials said the government had plans to erect a barbed wire fence
around the city as part of its preparations.
Troops were also on standby near the city, ready to be called to protect
important government buildings and diplomatic missions, officials added.
The security build-up appeared to have dashed the few remaining hopes that
Mr Sharif and Ms Benazir Bhutto, the opposition leader, could avert today's
expected government-opposition clash.
Although Mr Sharif has become increasingly willing to hold early elections,
he is demanding that President Ghulam Ishaq Khan must first step down before
his term of office ends in November.
However, Mr Khan and many of his supporters, including opposition leaders,
do not want to wait beyond October.

FT  16 JUL 93 / UN holds out hope for Iraqi weapons backdown

A SENIOR United Nations diplomat, holding out the prospect of lifting
crippling economic sanctions against Iraq if it accepts long-term monitoring
of its weapons programmes, arrived in Baghdad yesterday for talks with Iraqi
officials.
Mr Rolf Ekeus, head of the UN special commission into Iraq's weapons of mass
destruction, is expected to spend four days in Baghdad trying to resolve the
stand-off between UN weapons inspectors and Iraqi officials over the
installation of monitoring cameras at two missile test sites.
Two teams of UN inspectors have failed to persuade Iraq to mount cameras at
the site, or seal monitoring equipment there as an interim measure.
Failure to defuse the crisis would reopen the possibility of a UN-backed
military strike against the sites - a threat which has been raised
particularly by the US administration over the past week.
But Mr Ekeus' visit comes amid signs that Iraq is increasingly anxious to
win whatever easing it can of economic sanctions which have prevented Iraqi
export sales, particularly of oil, for almost four years.
Mr Ekeus and fellow diplomats at the UN believe Iraq's pressing economic
needs could force authorities in Baghdad to back down in the present
confrontation.
'The major carrot (for Iraqi compliance) is the ongoing sanctions and the
oil embargo,' Mr Ekeus said before arriving in Baghdad.
Parallel talks in New York between Iraqi Oil Ministry officials and UN legal
experts on a special six-month sale of oil worth Dollars 1.6bn (Pounds
1.06bn) were suspended on Wednesday as Iraqi officials considered a possible
draft agreement on the sale.
Confidentiality surrounding the market-sensitive talks have made it
difficult to assess their success, but UN diplomats said yesterday there
were indications an agreement might be close.
About 60 per cent of the revenues from the oil sale, which would add about
500,000 barrels of crude a day to the market, would be set aside for food
and medicines in Iraq, to be distributed and monitored by the UN.
The remainder would go towards paying for UN activities in Iraq.
But the scale of Iraq's economic problems was underlined by a UN Food and
Agriculture Organisation report, pointedly quoted in the official Observer
newspaper in Iraq, which warned of a 'grave human tragedy' unless food
supplies were augmented. The report said Iraq needed to import 5.4m tonnes
of food before July next year at an estimated cost of Dollars 2.5bn.
Mr Ekeus emphasised before leaving for Iraq that he would also be discussing
more broadly the principle of long-term monitoring of Iraq's weapons
programmes, called for under UN Resolution 715.
'We will try to address some more important issues this time that I hope
should clarify some points which are creating problems for us,' he said
later in Baghdad.
His first meeting last night was to be with Mr Mohammed Saeed al-Sahaf,
Iraq's foreign minister.
Deborah Hargreaves adds: Oil prices dropped to a three-year low in London
and New York as traders fear the resumption of even limited Iraqi oil
exports could add to the surplus on world markets, leading to a collapse in
prices.
The price for North Sea Brent crude oil in London slipped another 30 cents
yesterday to Dollars 16.45 a barrel.

FT  16 JUL 93 / Top US team to press Hanoi over MIAs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAIN SIMPSON and GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   HANOI, WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Winston Lord, US assistant secretary of state, arrived in Hanoi yesterday
to press for greater co-operation from the government on American servicemen
unaccounted for since the Vietnam war.
The delegation, the most senior from the US since the war, was dispatched by
President Bill Clinton after he decided earlier this month to stop blocking
Hanoi's access to loans from the International Monetary Fund and other
multilateral financing institutions. He demanded more progress on the
'missing-in-action' (MIA) issue before he could end a US trade embargo.
In Washington it emerged that Vietnam could start borrowing from the IMF as
early as October, after a review by the fund's board this week. Hanoi has
been ineligible for IMF loans since 1985 after falling into arrears on debt.
The IMF said the board meeting produced 'an international consensus that
would allow full-fledged co-operation between Vietnam and the IMF to
develop'.
Vietnam's programme of macroeconomic and structural adjustment had made
considerable progress, an IMF spokesperson said, and Mr Michel Camdessus,
the fund's managing director, had expressed 'deep satisfaction' at the
prospects of renewed co-operation.
The next step is for Vietnam to clear arrears of about SDR100m (Pounds
92.9m) with the help of a support group led by France and Japan. The IMF
could then restore its eligibility for loans and negotiate an economic
adjustment programme. The first drawing of up to SDR120m on a standby
facility could be made soon after the IMF's annual meeting at the end of
September.
Once the IMF and the multilateral development banks have resumed lending,
pressure from US companies to be allowed to trade and invest is expected to
grow. Mr Clinton must decide by September 14 whether to renew the trade
embargo for another year.
However, Mr David Givans, of Disabled American Veterans, one of four
veterans' groups represented in Mr Lord's delegation, said Mr Clinton had
made clear that his decision on IMF lending 'was not a precursor to any
other economic outcome (and) that this trip would in fact decide how the US
proceeds from here on in'.
The Vietnamese government says it is doing all it can to help account for
missing Americans and has opened archives, allowed investigators access to
closed areas and hosted numerous American visitors. It says it has returned
all 591 Americans it was holding in 1973 when US forces withdrew.
Mr Allen Kent, of Veterans of Foreign Wars, said the veterans wanted to
obtain a guarantee from Hanoi that it would give full co-operation and
assistance to US investigators tracing the 2,253 Americans officially
missing in Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia.

FT  16 JUL 93 / World Trade News: EC delays tariff-cutting talks -
Embarrassment for Brussels officials unready to negotiate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   EUROPEAN Community trade negotiators faced serious embarrassment
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
and accusations of bad faith - in Geneva yesterday as they revealed that
they will not be ready to negotiate bilateral tariff-cutting deals until the
last week of this month.
The EC delay is contrasted with a US decision to begin bilateral tariff
negotiations immediately, aimed at paving the way to a worldwide trade
liberalising agreement before the end of this year, as part of the Uruguay
Round of trade reform negotiations.
Negotiators from the other 96 countries involved in multilateralising a
widely acclaimed tariff-cutting agreement, reached in Tokyo last week by
leading industrial countries at the Group of Seven summit, were perplexed
and angered yesterday by European Community delays.
The delay is due to an apparent need to carry out a detailed audit of the
trade-generating impact of the Tokyo agreement. Responsible commissioners
and trade officials say they are unable to meet to complete the audit until
July 22.
Their embarrassment has been made more acute by the decision by Mr Peter
Sutherland, the new director-general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade, to call a top-level meeting of trade negotiators on July 28 to review
progress.
This will give European Community negotiators just three working days to
hold bilateral discussions.
'This is certainly somewhat awkward for us,' an EC official admitted. 'We
see the two weeks ahead as a clarification stage, rather than a negotiating
stage.
'No real negotiating will be practicable in July.'
Following the Tokyo breakthrough, which has raised hopes that a Uruguay
Round settlement can be reached in spite of more than two years of often
acrimonious delay, negotiators have been under extreme pressure to make
significant headway in tabling packages of tariff cuts across manufactures
and agriculture, and in opening their markets to trade in service.

FT  16 JUL 93 / World Trade News: Japan hints at cut in car exports
</HEADLINE>

JAPAN indicated yesterday it was likely to agree to a furtherreduction in
its car exports to the European Community, as a result of a fall in EC new
car sales which has proved much steeper than expected.
'We have not refused (the EC approach); we are listening to it. We have not
closed our ears,' an official at the Ministry of International Trade and
Industry said, following three days of talks in Brussels which ended without
formal agreement.
During the talks, the European Commission asked the Japanese delegation to
reduce the 1.09m exports envisaged for this year in the 'understanding'
governing access to the EC market during the Community's transition to an
open market in new cars by the end of the decade.
Japan agreed in April to reduce its car exports by 9.4 per cent on the basis
of forecasts that the EC market would decline by 6.5 per cent to around 13m
units this year.
The Commission now expects a fall of between 11 and 16 per cent. New car
sales in western Europe as a whole were already down 17.2 per cent between
January and June and, in its latest forecast, the European Automobile
Manufacturers' Association predicts that demand will be down by 15.8 per
cent for the year as a whole.
Without further reductions, Japan's market share would rise to
'substantially' more than 13 per cent this year, compared with less than 11
per cent in 1992, the EAMA warned yesterday.
The Japanese position has been that, while Japan recognised the fall in
demand in the EC car market, revising a formally agreed quota after only
three months would undermine the credibility of the bilateral agreement. It
was only agreed in April after months of wrangling.
Japanese car exports to the Community, however, have already fallen sharply,
according to Mr Robert Verrue, chief EC delegate to the talks - down in the
April-June period by about 30 per cent.

JAPANESE cotton spinners have begun to collect information for an
anti-dumping action against Chinese cotton fabric exporters, creating
potential embarrassment for the Japanese government, which has condemned the
use of anti-dumping measures to protect markets.
The Japan Spinners' Association indicated yesterday that a formal complaint
will be filed with the Tokyo government within months, as Chinese makers are
selling fabrics for shirts and sheets at 30-40 per cent less than the
Japanese-made product.
Japanese spinners say the cheap materials are damaging their industry, but
they have not yet shown evidence that Chinese producers are doing more than
take advantage of cheaper raw materials and production facilities.
In January the Japanese government imposed anti-dumping duties on Chinese
exporters of ferrosilicon manganese, used by the steel industry.
Japan's imports of clothing from China rose 17.5 per cent in the first half,
compared to the equivalent period of 1992, but one cause of the greater
penetration is a flurry of Japanese joint ventures in China.

FT  16 JUL 93 / Red faces at World Bank as HQ costs break budget
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE World Bank has sent three managers on administrative leave after 'loose
project management' pushed the cost of its new headquarters building in
Washington Dollars 83.5m over budget.
The the building was now expected to cost around Dollars 290m, compared with
a 1990 budget of Dollars 206.5m, the bank said. However, an internal inquiry
had concluded that most of the overrun was due to unrealistically low
initial estimates.
'Cost overruns for large buildings are not uncommon, but in this case, much
of the problem could have been avoided if realistic estimates had been
presented at the outset,' said Mr Ernest Stern, who is acting as president
while Mr Lewis Preston recovers from surgery.
'This was compounded by loose management and a failure to bring problems to
the attention of the bank's senior managers on a timely basis.'
A bank statement said the inquiry had found that 'all funds committed to the
project had been spent on essential components of what remains a strictly
functional building and there is no suggestion of financial impropriety of
any kind'.
However, Mr Sven Sandstrom, the World Bank managing director appointed to
head the inquiry, found that project managers had failed to inform either
senior management or board of the cost overruns. They had also spent Dollars
22m without authorisation on two buildings which are to be refurbished as
part of the overall headquarters project.
A second phase inquiry will begin immediately to assess the actions of the
managers and 'appropriate disciplinary measures, if any'.
The World Bank's construction problems are particularly embarrassing, coming
as they do on the heels of the furore over the lavish London headquarters
built for the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development.
Even critics of the World Bank's operating expenses, however, acknowledge
that the new headquarters, whose Dollars 123 per square foot construction
cost falls within central Washington norms, includes none of the expensive
marble or frills of the EBRD building.
'This is home grown incompetence, not imperial arrogance,' commented one
person familiar with the project.
In another sense, however, the bank's failure to oversee its own project
adequately is even more embarrassing, because of the institution's long
experience of advising borrowers in the developing world on project
management and supervision.
The preliminary budget, submitted to the board in February 1989, was set at
Dollars 186m. After a design competition and negotiations with the winning
architect, the budget was revised the following August to Dollars 206.5m.
The bank said yesterday it had ignored independent consultant engineers'
estimates that the building would cost Dollars 250m, in the expectation that
low demand in the construction sector and cost-saving measures would allow
it to stick to the approved budget.

Mr Sutherland had said on Wednesday the appointments would be based
'fundamentally on merit', but the need for balance between regions and
between industrialised and developing countries would be heeded. One deputy
has traditionally been a US national, the second an Indian. The new third
post was widely expected to go to a Latin American, as part of the
horse-trading over the appointment of the Irish Mr Sutherland.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US has placed a legal full stop at the end of a 10-year chapter of
efforts to develop a 'Star Wars' anti-missile defence system by now
declaring its full adherence to the traditional, narrow interpretation of
the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty.
The Clinton administration, by formally announcing its adherence to this
interpretation, renounced efforts to develop, test or deploy sea-based,
air-based, space-based or mobile land-based ABM systems.
The treaty was designed to prevent nuclear escalation by denying the US or
the Soviet Union the temptation to launch a first strike in the belief that
it could survive retaliation.
President Ronald Reagan's administration in the 1980s had sought to argue
that the ABM treaty did not prohibit development of space-based defences, a
key component of Mr Reagan's 'Star Wars' strategic defence initiative.
Mr Thomas Graham, acting director of the Arms Control and Disarmament
Agency, announced the position in a letter to Senator Claiborne Pell,
chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, who welcomed the return
to the traditional interpretation.
'This wise decision closes, on a high note, a sad chapter in US arms control
treaty relationships and in the relationship between the US Senate and the
executive branch,' said Mr Pell. He added that strict adherence to the
treaty would help persuade Ukraine to eliminate its nuclear weapons, and to
ensure Russian ratification of the Start II missile reduction treaty.
The Clinton administration has already renamed the SDI programme the
ballistic missile defence organisation. Funding has remained relatively high
but has been shifted away from programmes designed to defend against
strategic nuclear missiles, and towards tactical defences.

Assistant US Attorney Andrew C. McCarthy said another indictment would be

He also said the government had more than 150 hours of audio and video tapes

it is alleged, the defendants discuss the bomb plot.
On Wednesday, federal authorities disclosed that the government informant
who helped foil the alleged bomb plot last month had infiltrated the

<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton yesterday proposed giving US community financial
institutions Dollars 382m (Pounds 254.6m) in seed money over four years, to
encourage lending in devastated inner cities and poor rural areas, Reuter
reports from Washington.
'Millions of Americans in low- and moderate-income neighbourhoods have no
bank where they can cash a cheque, borrow money to buy a home, or get a
small loan to start a business or keep one going,' the White House said.
Under the proposal, Mr Clinton would try to meet his 1992 campaign pledge of
creating a network of 100 community development banks and financial
institutions.
The Dollars 382m in seed money would stimulate private lending in many rural
and urban communities starved of affordable credit, capital and basic
banking services.
Also, his plan would require regulators to reduce paperwork at banks, in
return for an increase in lending to low-income borrowers.

FT  16 JUL 93 / World Trade News: Uruguay Round negotiators peer through the
Tokyo fog - The 'breakthrough' at last week's G7 summit appears somewhat
different back in Geneva
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL, World Trade Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR almost 18 months the fate of the Uruguay Round of global trade
liberalisation has been in the hands of the US and the European Community.
With the breakthrough in trade negotiations in Tokyo last week, talks have
now reverted to Geneva and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. At
last, others among the 116 countries involved in the round now have a say.
But if Sir Leon Brittan, the EC's trade commissioner, hoped when he briefed
Uruguay Round trade negotiators in Geneva early this week that the Tokyo
breakthrough shifted the onus for progress on to others, then he will need
to think again.
Negotiators who have been forced to sit on the sidelines in recent months
are unanimous: 'We are cautiously optimistic about the outcome in Tokyo. But
there is ambiguity, and a total absence of detail,' one said: 'Until we see
the detail, we cannot move any further.'
Another developing country negotiator added: 'The major problems have been
left unsettled by Tokyo, and have been delivered back to Geneva in the same
state they were in before.'
This applies to disputes over the liberalisation of trade in textiles, to
trade in services, to plans for liberalising maritime services, to
international trade in films and television programmes, as well as many
others.
Demands from developing countries, and countries like Australia, for tariff
cuts on trade in non-ferrous metals and in wood, paper and pulp products,
also remain unresolved.
This reality sits uncomfortably with Sir Leon's exhortations on Monday to
Gatt negotiators that, following the deal reached by the 'quad' countries
(Japan, Canada, the US and the EC) in Tokyo, the time had come for other
countries to do their bit - to improve offers made over the past year on
tariff cuts.
The call was disingenuous at least. Many developing countries note that the
US and the EC have yet to make even a first tariff-cutting offer in many
areas of critical interest to them. Even Community officials now admit that
the Tokyo deal was more an agreement over a formula by which to achieve a
deal, rather than a specific set of tariff cuts. They say they are doing the
sums now, and will have no offer to present to trading partners until July
23.
Even then, critical areas like market opening for farm products, or tariff
cuts across the thousands of categories of traded textiles and garments, are
unlikely to be on the table.
'While I am cautiously optimistic, I don't think much will get done before
the autumn,' said Mr Balkrishan Zutchi, India's veteran Gatt ambassador.
This confirms comments from an EC official that the two weeks now remaining
before Geneva winds down for the August holidays will provide 'a
clarification stage rather than a negotiating stage'.
If non-quad countries are to be coaxed forward to improve market access and
tariff cutting offers, then the US and the EC will need to address
specifically a number of their concerns. These are:
Farm trade: farm exporters from Cairns group countries like Australia,
Argentina and Thailand are adamant that the EC in particular must make a
significant market access offer. If they are to open their markets further
to manufactured exports from the US or the EC, then greater opportunities to
sell farm products to Europe must be made available. Textiles: Mr Jesus
Seade, Mexico's Gatt ambassador, describes this as a 'highly unstable
dossier'. Many developing countries - prominently India - need better export
opportunities to the US and the Community if they are to bow to pressure to
open their markets to services, and tighten enforcement of intellectual
property protection.
Special and differential treatment: many developing countries have been
alarmed by western demands that they make marketing opening offers
comparable to those made by the quad countries in Tokyo.
They emphasise that the Gatt has always asserted the right of countries to
make commitments that match their financial and economic capacities.
Tariffication without exception: this is the demand that importers remove
all non-tariff barriers, and replace them with tariffs which are more
transparent, and more easily reduced over time. It is a demand particularly
precious to farm exporters.
It has been resisted fiercely by countries like Japan and South Korea, which
block all imports of rice on food security grounds, and Canada, which has
for decades maintained a supply management system in dairy products which
limits imports.
Amendments to the draft final act: this draft Uruguay Round agreement,
completed in December 1991, may not be carved in stone, but most countries
insist that the minimum of changes should be allowed, for fear that the
entire balanced package of commitments embodied by it will crumble.
Washington caused consternation late last year by calling for extensive
changes, linked with concern to protect its sovereign discretion to apply
unilateral trade sanctions where it deemed them necessary.

POWER generating equipment suppliers Toshiba and Westinghouse Electric have
announced agreements to reinforce positions in the Asian market.
Westinghouse is forming a joint venture in China to modernise steam turbine
generators. Toshiba has reached a technology transfer agreement with Samsung
Heavy Industries of South Korea.
Pittsburgh-based Westinghouse said its 50/50 joint venture with Longyuan
Power Technology Exploitation Corporation would initially focus on 150 steam
turbine-generators, each rated at 200MW.
Ultimately, a base will be established to provide technology and advanced
field service for more than 400 power stations in China.
Toshiba's 10-year deal with Samsung covers supercritical 500MW-class steam
power plants. It calls for the Japanese company to transfer design,
manufacturing and inspection technologies for the condensers, feedwater
heaters and de-aerators that make up the heat exchangers.
The deal is expected to reinforce Samsung's position in Korea for heavy
electrical apparatus, while enhancing Toshiba's strength in a key area of
power generation.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE CHANCES of the US Congress approving the North American Free Trade
Agreement have been enhanced by growing support for a proposal to create a
North American Development Bank.
A bill to establish the so-called Nadbank - to fund infrastructure and
environmental projects, and to aid communities hurt by the Nafta - attracted
25 co-sponsors on Wednesday, the day of its introduction in the US House of
Representatives. It was submitted by Congressman Esteban Torres, long a
Nafta foe. Twenty of the 25 have been critics of the Nafta.
'Nadbank can change the dynamic of the Nafta debate. Nadbank is a vehicle to
go beyond the divisive debate,' said Mr Torres. He has yet to commit himself
to supporting the Nafta - the free trade pact by the US, Mexico and Canada -
asserting that he will first study the supplemental agreements being
negotiated on the environment and labour.
Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, expects the negotiations to end
by July 31.
Mr Torres said he doubted the side agreements alone would gain the support
needed for approval of the Nafta in the House. However, 'a growing coalition
of labour, environmental, Latin and community leaders' could be brought on
board by 'an alternative comprehensive approach to sustainable trade and
development' with Nadbank as its central component.
The development bank proposal is also being considered by the Clinton
administration, which on Wednesday discussed the appointment of a 'Nafta
Tsar' to shepherd the pact through Congress.
A new report by the US council of the Mexico-US Business Committee says the
two countries will need Dollars 6.5bn (Pounds 4.33bn) over the next 10 years
just to bring the water supply, wastewater treatment and solid and hazardous
waste disposal at their border to internationally acceptable levels.
Billions more will be needed for roads, retraining programmes and
compensation for lost tariff revenues.
The bill introduced by Congressman Torres would give a Nadbank Dollars 5bn
in authorised capital over the next decade, with the aim to issue loans
totalling up to Dollars 20bn. The US would provide two-thirds of the paid-in
capital, with Mexico and Canada investing the rest.
Mr Raul Hinojosa Ojeda, a Californian professor and the chief proponent of
the Nadbank, said the institution might be attached to the Inter-American
Development Bank, but with its own directors.

SUPPORT for Canada's governing Conservative party has slipped since Ms Kim
Campbell became prime minister, according to a poll by Gallup Canada, Reuter
reports from Ottawa.
The Conservatives' popularity declined to 33 per cent in July after rising
marginally to 36 per cent after the party's leadership convention.
Some 43 per cent of decided voters said they would support the opposition
Liberals if an election were held immediately, up from 41 per cent in June.
A general election must be held within four months.
Ms Campbell was elected party leader, and and therefore prime minister, last
month.
Support for the opposition New Democratic party fell to 8 per cent in July,
its lowest standing since July 1961.
The right-wing Reform party received support from 7 per cent of decided
voters; the Bloc Quebecois, which seeks autonomy for the province of Quebec,
received 8 per cent. Twenty-five per cent of the 1,010 voters polled were
undecided.

FT  16 JUL 93 / Quotas for diamond and gold industries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Russian parliament yesterday approved a law on precious metals and gems
which confirms the growing power of the regions by giving them joint control
of gold and diamond production and sales, and bans foreigners from
production.
The law passed its second reading yesterday, and is expected to win final
approval today.
The law shares the state monopoly of precious metals and gems with the
republics and regions in which they are produced, and allows production
quotas to be determined between the federal and regional authorities. It
limits the extraction of precious metals and gems to companies and citizens
of Russia.
Mr Igor Ivanov, the parliamentary deputy who drafted the law, said yesterday
the export of gold, diamonds and other gems accounted for 15 per cent of
Russia's hard currency income.
Mr Ivanov said that 'in the past no one knew how much was sold to whom and
for how much - apart from a narrow circle in the government'.
The Committee on Precious Metals must report to parliament each year. The
law has been framed so that only the regions, and not the committee itself,
can engage in the extraction and production of the precious materials.
Russia's gold reserves are officially estimated at 330 tonnes.

FT  16 JUL 93 / Poland ready for deal on Dollars 12bn commercial debt: Both
sides are keen to settle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
POLAND and its London Club commercial bank creditors are to meet in London
on Monday with high hopes of a breakthrough in their long-stalled
negotiations over a debt reduction and rescheduling agreement.
Mr Krzysztof Krowacki, the Polish government's chief debt negotiator,
believes the time is now ripe to settle with the banks over the country's
Dollars 12.1bn (Pounds 8bn) debt.
He points to Poland's recently approved Dollars 660m standby loan with the
International Monetary Fund, loan commitments of Dollars 3.8bn from the
World Bank and a growing influx of foreign equity capital in evidence of
this.
At the same, he says, 'this is possibly the last time that we can explain to
the Polish electorate that it is in Poland's interest to make a reasonable
deal, even though it will cost Poland a lot of money.'
The 300 creditor banks represented in the negotiations are also anxious to
make a deal which would close a painful chapter in their relations with
Poland.
The communist authorities, who borrowed Dollars 17bn in the 1970s to prop up
their regime by grafting western factories on to an unreformed system,
defaulted on Poland's foreign debt in March 1981.
Arrears on the official debt accumulated throughout the period of martial
law from December 1981, but Warsaw resumed the servicing of its commercial
bank debt in 1983.
The arrangement lasted until the fourth quarter of 1989, when the first
post-communist government stopped payments. Since then the original Dollars
9bn commercial debt has swollen to Dollars 12.1bn, mainly through the
addition of capitalised interest.
Both sides now want an agreement, but not at any price. Many banks remain
angry about the terms agreed by the Paris Club of official creditors in
April 1991. The centrepiece was a two-stage, 50 per cent reduction of the
outstanding Dollars 33bn debt to governmental export credit and official
lenders. The agreement, which was concluded mainly on political grounds to
ease Poland's transition from communism to a market economy, includes a
clause obliging Poland to seek similar terms from the commercial banks.
But the banks, painfully recovering from their exposure to Latin American,
Asian and African defaulters, are refusing to be put in the Paris club
straitjacket. They are seeking a deal based on the assessment of their own
economic sub-committee, despatched to Poland last month, of what the country
can afford to pay.
Poland's position in the heart of Europe, its commitment to market reforms,
support from the IMF and World Bank, basic political stability and an
educated population of nearly 40m make its prospects good, the bankers
believe.
But the Polish team will argue that Poland will only be able to service its
debts over 30 years if it is left with sufficient resources to finance the
necessary economic growth. Even without a London Club agreement Poland is
faced with a serious bunching of debt repayments around the middle of the
first decade of the next century, both to the Paris Club and to the
international institutions which have been the main source of fresh capital
since 1989.
A further complication is that nearly 60 per cent of Poland's bank debt is
denominated in D-Marks, where interest rates have remained high, in contrast
to the decline in dollar interest rates in recent years.
Resistance to concessions is expected to be strongest from the German banks,
the biggest single creditors, who are also heavily involved in the Russian
market and fear that concessions to the Poles now will be seized on by the
Russians and other debtors, later.
But the British banks, with less at stake, are also reluctant to agree a
Paris Club style capital write-off, or allow Poland to retire up to a third
of its debt by buying it from the secondary market, as the Poles have
suggested.
Over 160 smaller creditor banks have dropped out of the picture by selling
their Polish debt on the secondary market where Polish paper has risen from
its floor, several years ago, of around 18 per cent of face value, to around
33 per cent, in expectation of an agreement.
Some tough bargaining lies ahead. But bankers believe that up to Dollars 2bn
in foreign investment is just waiting for a debt agreement. This gives an
incentive for Warsaw to settle. At the same time, many western banks are
anxious to move into what is expected to become a profitable, fast growing
market over the next decade and beyond. With a certain degree of flexibility
on both sides, the prospects for agreement on the major components of a deal
before the end of the summer look promising.

FT  16 JUL 93 / Western bankers hail doubling of Russian interest rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RUSSIA'S central bank has raised its interest rates to 170 per cent this
week, double the level of a month ago, in what is being hailed as a
breakthrough in the bank's acceptance of market principles.
The rate represents a much higher real annual rate, because of its method of
calculation. Russian banks grant credits on a monthly basis, at one twelfth
of the annual rate, or just over 14 per cent a month. this is equivalent to
around 400 per cent a year, not far short of the inflation rate, now running
at 15 per cent a month.
One western expert in Moscow said yesterday that this was a real step
forward by the bank, not just because interest rates had gone up, but
because there was 'now an intellectual acceptance that interest rates should
reflect the real cost of money, and that these should be borne by the
borrower.'
The move, coupled with decisions by the government to liberalise coal
prices, slash budget expenditures by 20 per cent and limit credits to other
members of the Commonwealth of Independent States to Rbs800bn this year, is
seen by the world financial institutions as the most convincing promise of
tough financial discipline for many months.
Such promise has also been accompanied by some economic gain, with the
rouble stabilising at around 1,050 to the dollar, and production falls
slowing.
However, Mr Boris Fyodorov, the deputy prime minister for finance, is now
under intense pressure from industry to relax his policy. The IMF and the
World Bank, in charge of disbursing the assistance to Russia agreed at the
US-Russian summit in Vancouver in April and the Group of Seven
industrialised countries' Tokyo summit in July, see the next two to three
months as critical.
There is now intense debate within the financial institutions and G7
governments on when the second Dollars 1.5bn tranche of the 'systemic
transformation facility' should be awarded. Senior officials in the US
administration believe there is sufficient proof of Russian good intentions
to pay it now, but the IMF remains more cautious.
The coal price liberalisation is particularly controversial in Russia, since
coal producers are claiming they will need to raise coal prices by four or
five times to compensate for the loss of government subsidies. Steel and
other metal producers argue that the higher prices will lose them the price
advantage they enjoy over western producers - a price advantage which has
triggered accusations of dumping, especially of aluminium.
Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, will come under intense pressure
when he returns from holiday in late July from industry groups and the
regions to loosen the constraints. The pressure will come at a time when he
is attempting to keep regional support for a new constitution.
'We have at last reached the point where we are hitting the real issue,'
said the western expert yesterday. 'Will they be able to hold the line which
they have been able to establish, or not. The next two to three months will
be decisive.'

<TEXT>
TURKEY'S constitutional court has outlawed the Kurdish-backed People's
Labour party (HEP), ending the possibility of informal dialogue with the
rebel Kurdish Workers party (PKK).
The court move came at the end of a week of intense consultations between
the government and political parties to find a common stance on the Kurdish
rebellion.
The judgment coincides with violent clashes in the Kurdish south-east where
security forces are stepping up operations against PKK rebels fighting a
nine-year campaign for Kurdish independence.
The 18 HEP deputies elected in 1991 formed a new party last week,
pre-empting the court decision.  Nonetheless, the court move also calls for
the withdrawal of parliamentary immunity for Mr Fehmi Isiklar, the respected
former chairman of HEP who could now face serious charges related to party
activities.
The HEP is the nearest thing to an explicitly Kurdish nationalist party and
is popularly seen as a PKK front - a charge some HEP deputies have not been
too anxious to contest.
The ruling is likely to be exploited by Kurdish hardliners as well as
politicians and those in the Turkish military who view any lifting of
restrictions on Kurdish television and newspapers as concessions to
terrorism.

FT  16 JUL 93 / Lech Walesa launches call for solidarity without Solidarity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WARSAW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Lech Walesa, the shipyard electrician who came to embody the struggle by
the Solidarity trade union against communism and who is now Poland's
president, says he wants a new kind of solidarity.
He has formed a new political grouping to challenge Poland's fractured
political parties in September's general election.
In a nationwide address on Monday, the president described existing parties
as weak and fractious, and warned of unstable future governments. He urged
voters back a 'non party bloc for supporting reform', or BBWR in its Polish
acronym. 'It's an attempt to recreate the Solidarity movement without
Solidarity,' said sociologist Mr Andrzej Rychard.
Mr Walesa, elected president in December 1990, is hoping to capitalise on
voter discontent with existing parties.
The president, an intuitive politician with his roots deep in working class,
catholic Poland, has been promoting his new party since parliament was
dissolved at the end of May. He decided to go for new elections rather than
patch up a new coalition after Ms Hanna Suchocka, prime minister for 11
months, failed by one vote to survive a no-confidence motion put by
Solidarity trade union deputies pressing for public sector wage rises.
Since then politicians on the fractured nationalist right in particular have
engaged in a bewildering and largely unsuccessful effort to establish a
united front. A new electoral law states that only parties which gain 5 per
cent of the vote, or 8 per cent as a coalition, can enter the new
parliament.
The new law is intended to reduce the fragmentation of parties and stabilise
future coalitions. But the nationalist and liberal conservative parties,
which have played an important role in pushing for privatisation and market
reforms, are also threatened by the new rules.
Opinion polls meanwhile given the BBWR 11 per cent of the vote, although the
party has only just unveiled its programme and has yet to select candidates.
However, this level of support will leave President Walesa's short of his
primary aim, which is to have the next parliament pass a new constitution
shifting the balance of power from parliament to the president. For this he
needs to control two thirds of the seats in parliament.
The BBWR is unlikely to make inroads into the countryside where the PSL, the
farmers' party formerly allied with the communists, is expected to re-enter
parliament with around 15 per cent of the vote.
Mrs Suchocka's Democratic Union, which remains the largest party, is
accepting that picking an open fight with the BBWR in the run up to the
election is pointless since the two groups are likely to end up forming a
coalition. That could mean a period of stable government but not the
political re-ordering which Mr Walesa wants before he faces re-election in
1995.

EUROPEAN Community heads of government have agreed to locate the proposed

A formal decision will be taken at an EC summit in Brussels in the autumn,

The central bank, the European Monetary Institute, will begin operating in
Frankfurt from the beginning of next year, it says.
The newspaper claims Mr John Major, UK prime minister, has asked other
government heads to delay an announcement until after Britain has ratified
the Maastricht treaty on European economic and monetary union.
In Bonn, the general view is that Britain has for the past 12 months been
the only EC member state fiercely resisting Frankfurt as the best site for
the European central bank. The German government has argued that it needs
Frankfurt to be the site to overcome public doubts in Germany about the
wisdom of creating a single European currency, eclipsing the D-Mark, and a
single central bank replacing the Frankfurt-based Bundesbank.
But, in Brussels, EC officials last night expressed doubt about the reported
understanding between EC heads of government. They pointed out that member
states were finding it difficult to agree on a successor to Mr Jacques
Attali as head of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. The
site of the EMI was even more controversial, they said. Choosing Frankfurt
would boost its standing considerably as a financial centre to rival Paris
and London.
EC leaders have agreed informally to try to strike a deal on the bank's site
and its president before the end of the year.
In London, Whitehall officials dismissed suggestions that EC leaders had
already agreed on a location and disputed that a majority favoured
Frankfurt. Mr Major is determined to resist the bank going to Frankfurt,
largely because of the impact on London as a financial centre. He believes
other EC leaders are also worried about furthering Germany's economic
dominance.

FT  16 JUL 93 / Big shake-up in motor racing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GRAND PRIX motor racing, its prestige already damaged by internal political
squabbles and the absence of world champion Nigel Mansell, faces a
fundamental change as a result of a decision yesterday by its governing
body.
The Paris-based Federation Internationale du Sport Automobile (Fisa)
declared illegal two of the key elements of the Formula One cars which have
helped justify grand prix's claim to be at the 'cutting edge' of motor
industry technology.
It banned electronic traction control and 'active' suspension systems with
immediate effect - to the chagrin of such leading teams as Williams and
McLaren, which have spent a fortune developing them, and the quiet delight
of less financially secure teams who believe they will become more
competitive.
If supported to the letter by Fisa, this year's championship could have been
turned upside down, with leading teams' points being invalidated.
But Fisa yesterday decided to ignore the logical consequences of a ruling by
stewards at last month's Canadian grand prix that leading cars were already
illegal because they had been using the systems for a year or more. The
results of all races to date will not be affected.
Nevertheless, a crisis atmosphere ruled last night. Williams, world
championship leader, has threatened to withdraw from the German grand prix
on July 25, and possibly from subsequent races, if its active suspension
system - one of its biggest advantages - is banned. The team was meeting in
Paris last night to consider its response.
The decision could change the shape of grand prix racing, with unpredictable
consequences for the vehicle makers and independent commercial sponsors who
pour millions of dollars into a global business still described as sport.
Mr Max Mosley, Fisa's president, is concerned about falling gates and fading
media interest. He wants races to become much closer and more entertaining
and thinks the technology ban will help.

<TEXT>
MR Giuseppe Garofano, the former senior executive of Italy's troubled
Ferruzzi group arrested in Geneva this week, yesterday agreed to his
extradition to Italy, writes Haig Simonian in Milan.
72 hours.
Mr Garofano, in hiding for the past five months, has been sought in
connection with a L250m (Pounds 107,000) political contribution to the
Christian Democrat party. Mr Garofano claims the money was a personal gift,
but magistrates investigating political corruption issued an international
arrest warrant on suspicion it came from Ferruzzi.
Italy's Consob stock market and companies watchdog this week took legal
action over alleged irregularities in the accounts of Ferruzzi and
Montedison, its main operating subsidiary. Mr Garofano was Montedison's
managing director for a number of years and also held senior positions in
Ferruzzi.
A Naples judge has authorised sequestration of expensive paintings, silver
and jewellery given by a leading drugs company executive to Mr Francesco De
Lorenzo, the former health minister.
According to leaked testimony, Mr Giampaolo Zambeletti, the executive,
regularly gave gifts, totalling about L300m, to Mr De Lorenzo, and Mr Paolo
Cirino Pomicino, a senior Christian Democrat ex-minister, and their
families.
Electoral reform crusader Mario Segni launched a new Italian centrist party
yesterday to take on the powerful Northern League at national elections
expected early next year, Reuter reports from Rome.
Alleanza Democratica (Democratic Alliance) groups breakaway elements of the
beleaguered Italian Socialist party (PSI) plus the small Republican and
Green parties.

FT  16 JUL 93 / Danes pledge to defend the krone
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HILARY BARNES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   COPENHAGEN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AS THE krone came under pressure in the foreign exchange markets yesterday,
Danish monetary authorities insisted that the currency would not be
devalued.
Mrs Marianne Jelved, Denmark's economy minister, reiterated that no
devaluation was planned while Mrs Kirsten Mordhorst, head of the National
Bank's (central bank) secretariat, denounced as 'crazy' market rumours that
the krone would leave the EMS.
Mrs Mordhorst said that the speculation could not have arisen among people
who knew anything about the situation in Denmark.
At the same time, however, the bank raised a key short-term interest rate,
the repo rate, from 7.8 to 9 per cent yesterday morning. It also imposed a
limit of 30 per cent of assets on access for the commercial banks to
repurchase certificates of deposit.
This tightened liquidity, sending the one-month Cibor (Copenhagen inter-bank
offer rate) from 8.87 per cent on Wednesday to 12.29 per cent yesterday, its
highest since March, when the krone was last under significant pressure.
The central bank's measures initially firmed the currency but, in the
absence of a reduction in German interest rates or a rise in French rates,
the krone weakened again.
At the end of the day the rate against the D-Mark was 3.8960, slightly
weaker than when trading opened.
A statement yesterday by Mr Erik Hoffmeyer, governor of the National Bank,
implied a further rise in short-term rates was possible. Describing the rise
in the repo rate as a natural reaction to the weakening krone, he added
'time will tell' whether the measure was sufficient.
According to Mr Hardy Larsen, head of arbitrage at Unibank, as long as the
franc remains weak, so will the krone. 'Unemployment is very high, and
outsiders think we must be interested in leaving the EMS system in order to
be able to lower interest rates,' he said.
The krone's weakness has also hit the bond market, where the yield gap
between Danish and German 10-year treasury bonds has widened from 0.21
percentage points at the beginning of last week to about 0.51 points
yesterday.
The Danish economy has been hit by the devaluation of sterling, the Swedish
krona and several other currencies last year, leading to a trade-weighted
appreciation of the krone and a 7 per cent drop in the value of exports for
the first four months of this year compared with the same period last year.

Chief executives of west European companies are more optimistic than their
US counterparts about economic prospects on both sides of the Atlantic,
according to a survey by Conference Board Europe, Reuter reports from
Brussels.
The Board, part of an organisation linking companies worldwide, said
yesterday that 54 per cent of European executives believed economic
conditions would improve over the next four years in western Europe and 74
per cent thought the outlook would get better in the US.
US executives were less optimistic on both counts, 48 per cent seeing an
improvement in western Europe and 56 per cent forecasting better conditions
in the US.
Less than half US and EC executives were seriously concerned about
competition from each other but a majority were worried about competitive
threats from Asia over the next four years.
National budget deficits and spiralling health care costs topped both the
European and American worry lists.

Mr Le Pen, who failed in efforts to hold conferences in Edinburgh and

FT  16 JUL 93 / German towns warn of waste crisis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Association of German Towns, which comprises 7,000 towns and cities with
51m inhabitants, yesterday warned of an imminent waste crisis on German
streets due to the mounting problems faced by Duales System Deutschland
(DSD), the national waste management scheme, writes Ariane Genillard in
Bonn.
Meeting Mr Klaus Topfer, the environment minister and chief architect of
Germany's recycling laws, the association said urgent new measures were
needed to ensure that municipalities were not faced with the costs of a
collapsing DSD.
DSD, which collects packaging waste from households in Germany, faced
near-bankruptcy last month before being partially rescued at the last minute
by funds from industry.
The company recently announced it will cut by 20 per cent the price it pays
to municipal waste management companies for the waste it collects and cannot
recycle.
DSD has been overwhelmed by the mounting flow of plastics it collects and
for which Germany has no recycling facilities. The company announced that it
will from now on only recycle plastics bottles under five litres and large
plastics. It also said it will stick to the legal recycling requirement,
which stands at 100,000 tonnes of plastics for 1993 and 1994.
The new measures will place severe burdens on municipal waste management
companies who must collect and dispose of all the waste not taken care of by
DSD. Cash-straped municipalities already face a shortage of landfill space
and limited incineration possibilities. Just over 40 per cent of waste
management companies in Germany are run by municipalities and are not
private enterprises.

FT  16 JUL 93 / Brussels postpones action on energy monopoly
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Commission has delayed plans to take six EC countries to the
European court over their respective energy monopolies, Mr Karel Van Miert,
EC competition commissioner, said yesterday.
The Commission decided to postpone its court action after two of the
countries, France and the Netherlands, said they would review their national
legislation.
The proposed court action was a significant step for the Commission towards
opening the EC energy market to competition. In May, Mr Van Miert challenged
entrenched monopolies in some countries for the import and export of
electricity and gas.
The Commission planned to take the six countries to court, alleging that,
under EC law, statutory monopolies over the import and export of electricity
in France, the Netherlands, Italy, Ireland and Spain, and for gas in Denmark
and France were illegal.
The Commission had previously asked for more information on the monopolies
and given warnings they could be illegal, but had been strongly opposed by
the six countries. Previous charges against three further member states have
since been dropped.
In an interview with the FT newsletter EC Energy Monthly, Mr Van Miert said
the Netherlands and France have confirmed their willingness to move on the
issue.
After a heated national debate, the Dutch announced that Article 34 of the
Electricity Act which grants monopoly import and export rights to the SEP,
the central power board, will be removed.
France, under the new conservative government of prime minister Edouard
Balladur, has now said it intends to review the monopoly powers of
state-owned Electricite de France and Gaz de France.
Welcoming this movement, Mr Van Miert said: 'Since this is such a touchy
issue in some member states I think the willingness, confirmed in writing,
to change things is really a considerable step.'
The hope is now that the other four countries will also decide to re-examine
their positions, making court action unnecessary. But he warned: 'If it
appears that this is just a time-gaining device this will not stop the
Commission from then taking action.'
The whole issue of energy market liberalisation will be the subject of
intense debate later in the year, when the Commission hopes to reach
agreement on a proposal to further open up the energy sector to competition.

FT  16 JUL 93 / French Privatisation: French look for the strong, silent
type - Government seeks supportive investors in sell-off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WANTED: Long-term investors willing to take minority holdings in privatised
companies. Any nationality accepted. Deep pockets and strong nerves
essential.
The French government is searching for noyaux durs, 'hard core' investors,
to participate in its privatisation programme. These are companies which
take minority stakes in another and then act as a stable, supportive
shareholder to shelter it against the storms of the private sector.
Noyaux durs played a prominent part in the last French privatisation drive
in 1986 and 1987. However, those sales took place at a time when the Paris
stock market was soaring and corporate profits were rising.
It may be more difficult for the present government to unearth loyal
investors in the current climate when many companies are strapped for cash
and the stock market is sluggish.
The concept of noyaux durs is indicative of France's ambivalent attitude to
capitalism. Although these shareholders act as strategic partners for the
company, they are alsoexpected to serve as a source of support for the board
in the event of a hostile takeover.
This contradicts of the prevailing Anglo-Saxon view that the threat of
takeovers makes senior management more efficient. 'What is it that you
French have got against takeovers?' asked an incredulous American banker at
a privatisation conference in Paris last week.
The answer is that the French have nothing against takeovers per se, but
prefer continuity of ownership.
This is understandable in a country such as France where many large
companies are controlled either by the state or by their founding families.
The few that fall outside those categories tend to be protected by complex
webs of cross-shareholdings and sweetheart deals.
Against this backdrop it is scarcely surprising that when the new French
government started to plan its privatisation drive it resurrected the
concept of noyaux durs as a way of offering some protection to the companies
on its hit list.
In theory the government faces a tougher task in rustling up compliant
investors in the present unfavourable economic environment. And some French
companies may be wary of alienating the US and UK shareholders that have in
recent years invsted heavily in the Paris stock market.
In addition, the performance of some of the 1986 and 1987 privatisation
candidates has been poor. For example, the share price of Suez, the
industrial and financial group, is now trading below the offer price
But in practice there seems to be no shortage of prospective noyaux durs for
the next round of privatisations.
Some groups have expressed interest in investing in companies with which
they have strategic links. Matra-Hachette, the defence electronics group,
has declared its interest in Renault, the motor group with which it produces
the successful Espace van in a joint venture, and Aerospatiale, the
aerospace concern.
Alcatel-Alsthom, the electronics company, has said that it would be prepared
to invest in France Telecom, even though it is not on the privatisation
list.
Other would-be noyaux durs have different motives. Societe Generale, the
banking group, has said that it plans to participate in the privatisations
as 'advisor, vendor and investor'. Its rivals interpret this as a
thinly-disguised bid for lucrative advisorships from the French government.
There are even signs of interest from foreign investors. IFIL, an Agnelli
family holding company, has said it sees the French privatisation programme
as a way of expanding beyond its native Italy.
There are also hopes of investment from Japan, where the concept of a long
term, silent-partner investment seems far less foreign than in the US or UK.
The critical question is whether the concept will still work in the modern
Paris stock market. It did in 1988 when the recently privatised Societe
Generale rallied its noyaux durs to stave off a raid by Mr Georges Pebereau,
the French financier.
But last year's drama when Nestle, the Swiss food group, succeeded in taking
over Perrier mineral water after a long and complex battle, showed that such
boardroom allies do not make companies invulnerable.
Meanwhile the recent row between Suez and Union des Assurances de Paris over
the former's refusal to cede control of Colonia, one of its German insurance
subsidiaries, illustrates that noyaux durs are not always as mutually
supportive as the French government would like to think.

FT  16 JUL 93 / Employers 'may offer unequal pensions'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Court of Justice has received advice from its own Advocate
General that employers may offer unequal pensions to men and women if the
purpose is to offset inequalities in the state pension scheme.
The advice has particular significance for UK and Dutch employers who
frequently pay so-called 'bridging pensions' to those of their employees who
are eligible for occupational pension for several years before meeting the
minimum age for state pension benefits.
It means that British employers who gave more generous bridging pensions to
men or Dutch employers who gave them to women will not be required to
provide the same benefits for members of the opposite sex, saving
considerable costs to occupational schemes.
'From the employers' point of view this is good news,' said Mr John
Cunliffe, partner at solicitors McKenna and Co and an expert in pensions
law. 'But from the point of view of jurisprudence, its a nonsense,' he said.
While it is not certain that the ECJ will accept the advice of its Advocate
General, it is considered unusual for it not to do so.
ECJ Advocate General Mr Walter van Gervan, gave his opinion in the case of
Roberts v Birds Eye Walls, a case which originated in Britain on behalf of
Mrs Roberts, a 60-year old pensioner. In that case, Birds Eye Walls, the
ice-cream maker, paid so-called bridging pensions to those who retired
before reaching state retirement age. But because British women are eligible
to receive state pensions from age 60 while men must wait until 65, she
obtained a smaller bridging pension than a man in similar circumstances.
The UK government had surprised solicitors for all parties in the case by
intervening at the last moment. The UK government had argued that if the EC
were to agree that inequality in pension benefits is acceptable under some
circumstances, it would pave the way for applicants seeking exemptions on a
wide variety of grounds.

Vuk Draskovic, leader of the largest Serbian opposition group, leaves
hospital yesterday and immediately vowed to oust Serbian President Slobodan
Milosevic and restore democracy in Serbia, which he called a dictatorship,
writes Laura Silber. Mr Draskovic under Mr Milosevic. He said he would obey
medical orders to avoid political engagement for the next two months. Mr
Draskovic appeared wan after ending an eight-day hunger strike in protest
against his detention. In apparent fear of mass unrest, Mr Milosevic last
Friday issued a pardon for the opposition leader after Mr Draskovic was
reported to be near death after a hunger strike. He had been jailed since
June 1 after anti-government demonstrations

FT  16 JUL 93 / Croatia presses on with bridge plan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
CROATIA yesterday pressed ahead with plans to rebuild a strategic bridge to
link the main coastal motorway with central Croatia, and the nearby Zemunik
airport.
Serb forces from the self-styled state of Krajina, which cuts Croatia in
half, warned they would bombard the bridge and yesterday they resumed
bombardments of Karlovac, a garrison town 30 miles southwest of Zagreb.
It was the first attack on Karlovac since the 1991 war in Croatia and raised
fears that the Serbo-Croat war could re-ignite.
Mr Cedric Thornberry, the deputy chief of the UN mission in former
Yugoslavia, repeated warnings of renewed violence in Croatia.
'Both sides are completely ready for an extremely bloody and destructive
war,' he told UN radio.
Ignoring warnings from the UN and the Serbs, Croat authorities have decided
to re-build the Maslenica bridge, joining central Croatia with the southern
Dalmatian coast. Serb rebels have constantly delayed the reopening of the
only overland route to southern Dalmatia which is not under Serbian control.
Three out of five barges set sail from Trogir, the Croatian port city,
carrying materials for the 279-metre pontoon bridge planned to replace the
destroyed bridge, reported Tanjug, the Belgrade news agency.
Mr Dusan Starcevic, a Krajina official, yesterday lambasted Zagreb
authorities for their 'unilateral' action, dismissing it as the
'continuation of Croatian aggression since January 22.'
Fighting continued in Mostar, the southwestern city on the River Neretva,
where Moslem and Croat forces fought hand-to-hand battles.
Croatian radio said the Moslem-led Bosnian army had launched an all-out
attack on Mostar. Bosnian radio also reported heavy clashes and said the
Croatian army (HV) and its Bosnian sister Croatian Defence Units (HVO) had
launched a joint attack on the town.
Commander Barry Frewer, spokesman for the UN Protection Force (Unprofor) in
Sarajevo, confirmed the Moslem-Croat clashes in Mostar. UN peacekeepers
earlier this month withdrew from Mostar after warnings from local HVO
commanders.
Cmdr Frewer yesterday confirmed Moslem allegations that regular Croatian
army units were crossing into Bosnia to support the HVO. Croatia has
repeatedly denied that its army has been despatched to Bosnia. 'We have seen
signs of HV members supporting the HVO. I have no numbers and I cannot
confirm whether the Croatians are advisers or combat troops,' he told
reporters in Sarajevo.

FT  16 JUL 93 / GUS extends voting rights beyond 2% of shareholders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GREAT Universal Stores, a Pounds 4.7bn retail, property and finance company
controlled by only 2.2 per cent of its shareholders, is to join the modern
corporate world.
GUS said yesterday it would give votes to the 97.8 per cent of shareholders
who do not have them under its two-tier capital structure. The move will end
the Wolfson family's effective control over the company, which owns
Burberrys, The Scotch House and the Kays mail order catalogue.
Half the voting shares are held by the Wolfson family, the Wolfson
Foundation and other connected charitable trusts. GUS's chairman is Lord
Wolfson of Marylebone, the son of Sir Isaac Wolfson who took control of the
company in the 1930s.
GUS also appointed four new non-executive directors in a step designed to
bring it closer in line with the recommendations of the Cadbury committee on
corporate governance.
One banker said the combination of the enfranchisement and the appointments
would 'put GUS more on a par with modern companies'. He described the
present share structure as 'extraordinary'.
With Savoy Hotel, GUS has been perhaps the most famous example of a large UK
quoted company maintaining non-voting shares.
Investors generally shun non-voting or limited voting shares, and although
the GUS shares receive the same dividends, the share prices of the two
classes have diverged widely.
Mr Richard Pugh, deputy chairman of GUS, said the company had been thinking
about enfranchisement for a long time and there was 'no significance as
such' in the timing of the news. 'We always had the intention to do it
sometime,' he said.
Holders of the voting shares will be compensated with extra shares.
Anticipation of the announcement had already driven both classes of shares
higher. Yesterday the price of voting shares rose 100p to Pounds 34.38p and
non-voting shares rose 110p to Pounds 18.75p.
One of the four new non-executives is Mr Jonathan Charkham, who was a member
of the Cadbury committee.
Another is Lord Wolfson of Sunningdale, who was a director of GUS in the
1970s and is the chairman of Next, the retail group. He is a first cousin of
Lord Wolfson of Marylebone.
GUS also announced that pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 443.6m to Pounds
475m in the year to March 31, its 45th consecutive year of profits growth.

FT  16 JUL 93 / Report on EBRD puts final cost of refit at Pounds 66m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN OFFICIAL report into the European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development's London headquarters rejects the bank's original justification
for the cost of fitting out the offices and says the final figure will be
Pounds 66.2m compared with the original budget of Pounds 53m.
The bank had said the expenditure was in line with comparable City office
projects. But according to the report, prepared by accountants Coopers and
Lybrand, the bank spent more than Pounds 1,000 per square metre for fitting
out the building compared with an average of more than Pounds 900 for a
typical 'prestige' specification building and Pounds 700 for a 'high'
specification building.
The report also says the architects who worked on the building at One
Exchange Square were appointed without competitive tender and details a
number of new examples of lavish spending.
The report will be presented at a news conference today given by Mr Claes de
Neergaard, chairman of the EBRD's audit committee.
EBRD executives said they expected Mr Jacques Attali, the bank's president,
to leave the bank today, two months earlier than expected, despite his
intention to stay on until a permanent successor was in place.
Mr Neergaard will also present a 30-page commentary on the report written by
the EBRD's audit committee which is expected to be critical of Mr Attali, Mr
Anders Ljungh, vice-president of finance, and Mr Pierre Pissaloux, the
cabinet director. Coopers also looked at Mr Attali's use of private jets,
fees he received for speeches and his slowness in repaying personal expenses
initially charged to the bank.
Bank executives who have seen the report say it highlights a number of
costly items including:
Pounds 1.3m, or Pounds 44 per square foot, for specially coloured carpet
designed to appear 'shadowless';
Pounds 250,000 for metallic aerofoil-shaped column casings, each of which
cost Pounds 4,000;
Meeting room chairs at a cost of Pounds 1,000 each;
Marble cladding and flooring which cost more than Pounds 1.6m, including
Pounds 845,000 spent on replacing existing new marble in the lift areas;
Curved doors, which cost Pounds 1,700 each, about Pounds 600 more than a
typical high-specification door;
Almost Pounds 6m for a high-tech system of suspended ceilings.
The executives say it examines the performance of the project architect,
Anglo-French partnership Berthet Pochy Siddell Gibson, and the relationship
between Mr Jean Louis Berthet of BPSG and Mr Attali.
The report says the French side of the partnership, Berthet et Pochy,
'appears to have been appointed' to do some initial work for the bank at its
previous headquarters on Mr Attali's recommendation. BPSG was subsequently
appointed to work on the Exchange Square project without competitive tender.
BPSG's work was supposed to be managed by the main contractor, Bovis. The
report, however, cites a UK government memo which quotes Mr Berthet as
saying he received design instructions from Mr Attali, 'often, over the
weekend, in Paris'. BPSG's fees and expenses from the project have totalled
more than Pounds 3m, though the report says these are reasonable. However,
Berthet et Pochy is gaining additional royalties because it designed chairs,
some desks and work stations for the project.
The report criticises Berthet et Pochy for not declaring in advance that it
would make royalties from the furniture. It is also critical of the EBRD for
not giving overall management responsibility for the project to a single
individual.

FT  16 JUL 93 / Productivity up 10.5% as jobless total falls again: New
Jobcentre vacancies at highest level for 2 1/2 years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SHARP rise in UK manufac-turing productivity, a squeeze on earnings
throughout the economy and the fifth successive monthly fall in unemployment
yesterday boosted hopes that Britain has a substantial platform for
non-inflationary growth.
Production per manufacturing employee was 10.5 per cent higher in May than
12 months previously, the biggest year-on-year rise for more than 13 years,
suggesting that this sector is leading the recovery.
While average earnings across the economy rose 3.75 per cent in the 12
months to May, the lowest year-on-year rise for 26 years, optimism about an
upturn was further buoyed by another decline in unemployment. The number of
people without jobs and claiming benefit fell by a seasonally-adjusted 7,600
last month to 2.91m, the lowest level for eight months. The unadjusted
figure dropped 51,600 to 2.865m.
The economic indicators were hailed by Mr John Major, the prime minister, as
'very good news indeed'. He told the House of Commons: 'It is entirely clear
that we are coming out of recession and into recovery, and equally clear
that we are leading Europe into recovery.'
Opposition politicians voiced disappointment that the fall in unemployment
was no greater, pointing to the more substantial declines of more than
25,000 in both February and March. Mr Alex Carlile, Liberal Democrat
employment spokesman, said the June reduction would 'make little impression'
on unemployment of nearly 3m.
In further indications that employers are starting to step up recruitment
efforts in the wake of lower interest rates and the devaluation of the pound
last autumn, new vacancies notified to government Jobcentres have climbed to
their highest level for two-and-a-half years.
Overtime working in factories was at its highest point in May for nearly 12
months, a sign that manufacturers are expanding production to try to take
advantage of greater competitiveness and a sharp fall in wage costs per unit
of factory output. In the three months to May, these costs were 3.6 per cent
lower than in the same period of 1992, the biggest fall since the Department
of Employment started records in 1970.
Since numbers out of work started to drop in January, the total has shrunk
by 83,100. The fall has particularly benefited south-east England excluding
London - a region hard hit by the recession. Unemployment there dropped 4.6
per cent in the five months to June, well above the overall fall for the UK
of 2.8 per cent. The south west also saw a relatively big reduction in
joblessness, while northern England bucked the trend and recorded a rise in
unemployment over the same period.
In June, most regions saw a fall in unemployment, with the south west, the
west Midlands and Yorkshire and Humberside registering significant net flows
of people into jobs.
The pound lost 1 1/4 pfennig against the D-Mark to close in London at
DM2.565 while it fell nearly 1 1/2 cents against the dollar to close at
Dollars 1.488.

FT  15 JUL 93 / International Company News: BPI makes defensive stock sale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER WISE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LISBON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BANCO Portugues de Investimento (BPI) has reinforced its central core of
shareholders by selling 7 per cent of its Treasury stock to Itausa, the
Brazilian group.
The sale is seen as a defensive move against Banco Santander of Spain, which
has been buying BPI shares for the past three months. Santander, with its
partner, the Royal Bank of Scotland, bought out Portugal's Banco Comercio e
Industria three years ago.
BPI is using the Itausa group as a white knight. As part of the deal, BPI
purchased the Brazilian group's 12 per cent holding in another Portuguese
bank, Banco Fonsecas e Burnay (BFB) for Es7.1bn (Dollars 44m) and at the
same time sold the Brazilians 7 per cent of its own Treasury stock to
strengthen its position against Santander's approach.
The company has a widely dispersed spread of shares among many relatively
small shareholders. But there is a core of investors who have signed a pact
to sell to each other if they plan to quit the bank.

THYSSEN Industrie, the capital goods division of Thyssen, hopes to bring all
of its divisions back into the black in the next two years, according to Mr
Eckhard Rohkamm, management board chairman, Reuter reports from Essen.
Mr Rohkamm said that if all divisions were able to remain profitable under
difficult economic conditions, the company would be able to boost lift its
sales to earnings ratio.
'Thyssen Industrie as a whole is still profitable and will remain so to the
end of the year. But unfortunately we have some areas that are making
losses,' Mr Rohkamm said.
He declined to say which companies would post a loss in the current year but
said automotive supply and engineering were hit hardest by the slump in car
and steel industries.
'When a big customer such as the car industry and a second large customer
such as the steel industry are having massive problems . . . then, of
course, areas that are dependent on steel and cars are massively affected,'
he said.
He said there were no signs yet of a recovery of group plant and equipment
orders.
Orders on hand were about DM9bn (Dollars 5.6bn) but group incoming orders
would be down 10 per cent from DM8.4bn a year earlier.
Thyssen Machinenbau, the engineering division, was up to 90 per cent
dependent on orders from the car industry, he said. The automotive industry
accounted for 28 per cent of Thyssen Industrie's total sales.
While continental European carmakers were gripped by recession, Thyssen
Industrie operations in the US and UK had benefited from rising car sales.
Tallent Engineering, its UK unit, was working at high capacity and showing a
very satisfactory development, he said.

FT  15 JUL 93 / International Company News: Court puts off decision on Ciga
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A MILAN court yesterday postponed for the second time a decision on the
future of the controlling stake in the Ciga luxury hotels chain, held by
Fimpar, the holding company controlled by the Aga Khan.
The postponement means trading in Ciga and Fimpar shares, suspended seven
weeks ago, is unlikely to resume soon. The court put off a decision until
October 5.
The stake has been frozen since a German arm of the IMI financial services
group, which led a Dollars 100m credit to Fimpar, sought court approval for
a freeze on Fimpar's assets. The credit, which matured earlier this year,
has not been repaid, nor has it been renewed.
The court's decision to freeze Fimpar's assets pending a decision on the
legality of IMI's claim prompted the suspension of trading in Fimpar and
Ciga shares. IMI turned to the courts in an indirect attempt to gain
representation for Fimpar's foreign bank creditors in the restructuring plan
for Ciga being prepared by Mediobanca, the Milan merchant bank.

FT  15 JUL 93 / Dell warns of loss and revises lending
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
DELL Computer's share price fell sharply yesterday when the US personal
computer manufacturer warned of a second-quarter loss after writedowns and
restructuring charges.
Dell said the losses would be between Dollars 1.65 and Dollars 1.85 per
share and pre-tax charges would amount to Dollars 75m to Dollars 85m for the
quarter to August 1.
The projected loss might place the company in default of the terms of its
credit facilities, it said. It was working with its lenders to revise the
terms. 'I am confident that we will be able to secure alternative financing
or obtain a waiver,' said Mr Thomas Meredith, chief financial officer.
A long-time favourite among Wall Street investors, Dell has become the fifth
largest PC company in the world by pioneering direct marketing of PCs
through mail and telephone sales. Its sales tripled to Dollars 2bn in the
past two years.
Yesterday, however, Dell's share price dropped to Dollars 13 7/8 , a 2 1/2
 year low, before regaining some ground to trade at Dollars 16 1/4 at
midday, down Dollars 3 from Tuesday's close and 67 per cent below its high
of Dollars 49 7/8 in January.
Dell expected to report second-quarter revenues of Dollars 710m to Dollars
730m, a 55-60 per cent advance on the corresponding period. Total revenues
for fiscal 1993 would be about Dollars 3bn.
'Hypergrowth' was at the root of its problems, it said. Management controls
had not kept pace with the rapid expansion of sales.
According to analysts, it also faces 'credibility problems'. In May, Dell
reported a sharp drop in first-quarter earnings, which it blamed on delays
and cancellation of notebook computer products.
Analysts then expressed concern that Dell's problems appeared to go beyond
notebook computers. Yesterday, their fears were confirmed.
Dell said that in addition to costs associated with the delayed and
cancelled notebook products, it would incur restructuring charges.
It expected to resume earnings growth by the fourth quarter of the fiscal
year. 'While the loss is certainly disappointing, we are determined to take
the steps necessary to strengthen Dell for the future,' said Mr Michael
Dell, chairman and chief executive.

PRESIDENT Kim Young-sam of South Korea yesterday sacked two top generals
allegedly linked to corrupt arms purchases, a defence ministry spokesman
said, Reuter reports from Seoul.
General Cho Nam-pung, commander of the country's three field armies, and
Lt-General Park Woong, the assistant defence minister, would be replaced,
the spokesman said.
The two were among 34 defence officials and military officers accused last
week by the Board of Audit and Inspection of being involved in irregular
deals and bribe-taking.
Under Mr Kim's orders the board investigated recent military hardware
purchases, including a Dollars 5bn air force modernisation plan, which
opposition politicians say were secured through corrupt means.

FT  15 JUL 93 / US and N Korea say nuclear row talks 'useful'
</HEADLINE>

   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SENIOR US and North Korean officials held seven hours of talks in Geneva
yesterday in a second attempt to head off confrontation over Pyongyang's
refusal to allow international inspection of suspect nuclear sites.
Mr Robert Gallucci, US assistant secretary of state, called the talks
'useful'. Mr Kang Sok-ju, North Korea's first vice-minister for foreign
affairs, said they had been 'intensive, productive and useful.' The two
sides meet again tomorrow.
Yesterday's was the second encounter over the issue following Pyongyang's
decision in March to withdraw from the 1968 nuclear non-proliferation
treaty. At talks in New York in June, North Korea agreed to suspend its
decision but refuses to give International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors
access to the suspect sites.
The IAEA believes that North Korea may be storing plutonium that could be
used to make nuclear weapons without declaring it to the agency as required
by the non-proliferation treaty rules.
North Korea denies this but has refused access to two buildings close to its
nuclear reactor at Yongbyon, 95km north of Pyongyang, where the IAEA
believes the plutonium may be stored.
The US and North Korea last month pledged not to start nuclear war and
voiced support for a nuclear-free Korean peninsular, impartial application
of IAEA safeguards, non-interference in each other's internal affairs and
the peaceful reunification of Korea.
This week's talks centre on what would constitute 'impartial' inspections.
North Korea has claimed that the IAEA is biased in favour of the western
powers, and the US has threatened to seek United Nations sanctions against
North Korea if the talks fail. President Bill Clinton warned last weekend
that, if North Korea ever used nuclear arms, it 'would be the end of their
country'.

<TEXT>
HAITIAN soldiers fired in the air yesterday to break up a protest by scores
of youths urging the immediate resignation of military rulers and the return
of exiled President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, AP reports from Port-au-Prince.
No arrests or casualties were reported from the confrontation, which took
place in the vast Port-au-Prince slum of Cite Soleil, where troops massacred
scores of Aristide supporters after a military coup in September 1991.
The protesters, most of them teenagers or younger, carried photographs of
the deposed president and chanted: 'Aristide, the country is for you]'
The protest came as Haitian politicians from across the political spectrum
were gathering in New York for UN-brokered talks on setting up a democratic
government.
The talks, which opened yesterday, will address how to bring peace to Haiti,
contain political strife, and get parliament back on track so President
Aristide can return to power on October 30.
The talks, which are expected to last three or four days, are the second
stage in a UN-sponsored process outlined under a July 3 agreement signed by
Mr Aristide and military chief General Raoul Cedras.

FT  15 JUL 93 / Estonia's hunt for identity alarms Russians: Matthew
Kaminski, recently in Narva, on a new aliens law
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MATTHEW KAMINSKI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN 1944, Stalin's troops pushed out or deported 30,000 Estonians from Narva.
The Russians who took their place now fear a similar fate.
The peaceful appearance of the industrial town belies a deep anxiety among
its residents who, at least under the law, are now strangers in a foreign
country.
Earlier this week, President Lennart Meri signed an aliens law that
discriminates against the Russian minority, which constitutes around 40 per
cent of the population.
The law results from Estonia's efforts to assert a national identity after
50 years of Soviet rule and although the new statute was amended to adopt
some suggestions made by the Council of Europe and the CSCE, it falls far
short of mollifying ethnic Russians or Moscow.
Russians must now pass a language test for Estonian citizenship or apply for
residence and work permits. Neither is guaranteed.
'I guess I'll have to go back to Russia,' says Valia Solovyova, 21, who
sells flowers near the Lenin statue that stands in the town square.
Such sentiment has spawned a crisis in Estonia's north-east corner. The
cities of Narva and nearby Sillamae, where the Russian population exceeds 95
per cent, will vote on regional autonomy this weekend.
'We'll never agree to alien status in our own country, no matter what it
costs or what it takes,' says Vladimir Aleksyev, Narva's trade union leader.
'They want us to leave Estonia,' says Tatyana Yanchenko, 31, who, like many
members of her generation, was born in the country. 'When Estonia was
destroyed during the war and Russia rebuilt it, nobody called us occupiers
like they do now.'
Young people, whose parents came to work in Soviet factories after the war,
worry their children will not learn Russian in school. Among the older
generation, the aliens law only exacerbates the shock they have felt at the
collapse of the Soviet Union.
Mr Vladimir Chuikin, the town council chairman, is leading the referendum
drive with help from Moscow. At his office, which he also used as the local
Communist party chief, Mr Chuikin warns ominously of 'another Ulster' if
Estonia tries to stop a vote it considers illegal.
Ants Liiments, an Estonian who is Narva's assistant mayor, calls Mr Chuikin
a dangerous populist who exploits the people's ignorance of the law. But Mr
Liiments admits the law is flawed: 'People should be granted Estonian
citizenship in a simplified way because it's not their fault they were born
here or that their mothers or fathers came here.'
The crisis threatens stability across the region. President Boris Yeltsin
last week hinged a troop withdrawal timetable from all three Baltic states
on improved treatment of the Russian minority.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GENERAL Motors plans to hold back US price increases in the 1994 model year
in an attempt to win back market share.
The company, in the throes of a restructuring to return loss-making North
American operations to profit, said that in the model year starting in
October, it would expand the 'value pricing' marketing idea it initiated in
1993.
This involves dropping the price of certain models of vehicles equipped with
popular levels of optional equipment. The idea is to lift sales and run GM's
factories closer to capacity, to raise profits.
Mr Michael Losh, a GM vice-president, said value pricing had been a factor
behind the resurgence of GM's North American sales this year.
The company's share of the US passenger car market fell sharply late last
calendar year, to less than 31 per cent, when it cut back sharply on
unprofitable sales to fleet buyers.
It has recovered this year and for June totalled 37.1 per cent, compared
with 36.7 per cent a year earlier, but for the first half of 1993 it was
down a point on 1992, at 35.3 per cent.
The recovery has been due to value pricing and because Japanese competitors,
hurt by a strong yen, have been increasing their prices further.
Mr Losh said that in the 1994 model year, GM's prices would rise by 1.5 per
cent, even though they were fitted with additional equipment.
Truck prices would rise by 2.2 per cent and the average price for GM
vehicles would go up about 1.8 per cent.

FT  15 JUL 93 / International Company News: Hilton hit by lack of 'high
rollers'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A SHORTAGE of 'high rollers' - gamblers willing to bet the largest stakes -
at the Las Vegas Hilton contributed to a second-quarter decline in net
income for Hilton, the hotels and gaming group, to Dollars 26.8m, or Dollars
0.56 a share, from Dollars 32.4m, or Dollars 0.68 a share, in the same
period in 1992.
A strong rise in operating income from gaming had helped Hilton to shrug off
flat operating revenues from its hotels division in 1992 and the first
quarter of 1993.
In the three months to June 30, however, operating income from gaming fell
slightly, to Dollars 37.4m from Dollars 37.5m.
The company blamed the result on a lack of gamblers placing large stakes at
the tables in the Las Vegas Hilton, although it said the Flamingo Hilton in
Las Vegas and its two hotel-casinos in Reno, Nevada, had done well.
The hotels division recorded unchanged operating income, at Dollars 29.7m.
Continuing weakness in New York and Hawaii, and industry-wide pressure on
rates, had accounted for the result, Hilton said. The hotel occupancy rate
rose by one point, to 70 per cent, compared with the same quarter in 1992,
but average room rates fell in a number of areas.
Turnover rose 17 per cent to Dollars 345.2m from Dollars 294.8m. Net income
was struck after financing charges up to Dollars 17.7m from Dollars 13.2m
due to the Dollars 300m of extra borrowing taken on last year to finance
further casino developments.
Hilton said it had accelerated its development of casinos in New Orleans and
Kansas City, both of which were expected to open in the first quarter of
1994.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VOLUME showed more health in stock index futures as good UK inflation
figures and expectations of a German interest rate cut breathed a little
life into the market, Christine Buckley writes.
The better than expected inflation news encouraged investors to hope that a
UK interest rate cut may be, if not round the corner, possibly on the
horizon. Germany's cut, expected today, will add to the climate of
anticipation.
But as such hopes are long term, the volume in the September contract on the
FT-SE 100 - 7,564 at the close - did not translate into an upward movement
of the future, and it was kept in check ahead of Wall Street's opening. It
started the day at 2,837, and just before the US market began trading it set
the day's low of 2,830. A rally then pushed it up to 2,850 by mid-afternoon
 -a level which heralded the sellers. Their action took 10 points off to
leave September at a 2,840 close - 5 points down on the day.
The contract was just over a point ahead of its fair value premium to cash
of 7 points, although it had traded more convincingly ahead of that level
during the day.
In traded options, activity was strong in the Euro FT-SE option, which is
stimulated by the expiry tomorrow of the July contract. It traded 6,427
lots. Total volume was 26,932, against the previous day's 29,437, with the
FT-SE 100 option having 7,646 lots dealt.

FT  15 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: Switching talk again weakens shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FURTHER HINTS around the City that another big international switching
operation out of UK equities could have been set in train saw London's
equity market deliver another disappointing performance yesterday.
The FT-SE 100 Index closed 4.8 lower at 2,832.3, ignoring a welter of
positive factors, including the lowest UK headline inflation figure for
around 30 years, a strong gilt-edged market and a firm opening performance
by Wall Street.
The major bearish factors affecting the market included substantial weakness
in the food retailing and manufacturing sectors, the brewing group, power
generation stocks, and the media and aerospace issues. And there were
lingering fears that the completion of the BT3 flotation could bring a
series of large rights issues.
Significantly, the weakness in the market was not confined to the leaders:
the FT-SE Mid 250 stocks also came under pressure, leaving the Mid 250 Index
7.5 down at 3,222.5.
Activity in the market was a relatively high 612.7m shares, with non-Footsie
stocks accounting for 55 per cent of the day's business, well down from
recent levels. Dealers pointed out that customer business rose sharply on
Tuesday when the value of retail activity was worth almost Pounds 1.6bn, the
highest single day's total since May 20. Tuesday was featured by a string of
heavy programme trades.
The session began with share prices under minor downside pressure,
reflecting the easier overnight performance by Wall Street and continuing
concern over the recent poor showing by London in the face of the good news
on UK manufacturing and output data published on Tuesday.
The inflation news, revealed in mid-morning, showed headline inflation at a
30-year low and the underlying rate at a 25-year low. While it transformed
the gilts market, where long-dated stocks raced higher, it failed to trigger
any substantial support for equities.
Share prices weakened significantly over the lunchtime period, with the
FT-SE 100 declining to a low for the session of 2,826.7, a fall of 10.4,
before stabilising as Wall Street opened in positive territory.
The story of another switching operation being carried out followed hints
that one of the big international broking houses had taken out a very big
over-the-counter put option on the London equity market. The sharp sell-off
that hit the London market last week was attributed to heavy switching,
mainly by US institutions, out of UK equities and into the German market.
Other traders said the weakness in the market was because of more mundane
factors such as the continuing bookbuilding process in BT3, where the UK
public part of the offer closed yesterday. 'It is summer, BT3 is there to
distract us, and the market is struggling to find a support level,' said one
strategist, but he conceded that the market could be due for a bounce.
Sterling's strengthening, against both the dollar and the D-Mark, hit the
big overseas earners.
Abbey National, easier recently on a series of broker sell notes, topped the
list of active stocks following a sizeable agency cross. But Standard
Chartered, where talk of rights issues and takeovers were both heard, surged
ahead to an all-time peak.

FT  15 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: BAT in demand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
International trading group BAT Industries bucked the market trend after
Morgan Stanley issued a strong 'buy' recommendation. The shares finished 2
ahead at 418p following hectic trading of 9.4m.
A note from Mr Youssef Ziai, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, calls BAT a
'cheap insurance stock'. He said: 'At the current share price, BAT's
insurance operations alone account for nearly all of the stock's market
capitalisation. The tobacco activities, with pre-tax earnings of over Pounds
1bn per annum, are in for less than one year's profits.'
Strong rumours were heard that Rank Organisation would accompany this
morning's results with the announcement of a large hotel disposal. The
shares rebounded following a weak session on Monday to close 8 up at 767p.
Market talk mooted that a Pounds 60m disposal had been agreed, suggesting
that Rank may have finally sold one of its prestigious London hotels, such
as the Royal Lancaster.
Food retailers endured another poor session, with UBS said to have lowered
its profits forecasts for the leading stocks, the broker blaming low food
price inflation and continuing margin pressure. Argyll Group lost 3 to 307p,
Iceland 9 to 216p, Kwik Save 8 to 684p, Morrison Supermarkets 6 to 134p, J.
Sainsbury 5 to 431p and Tesco 5 1/2 to 201 1/2 p.
Strength in Great Universal Stores continued ahead of today's results, with
hopes still high that it will announce plans to restructure its shares. The
ordinary stock rose 138 to 3338p and the 'A' 12 to 1765p.
Profit-taking in the Recs and bearish noises in the generators made for a
weak electricity utility sector.
One broker was said to have issued 'take profits' advice on National Power,
down 9 at 349p, and PowerGen, 10 off at 371p. Among the Recs, Norweb
declined 7 to 516p and East Midlands 9 to 465p.
Negative comment on Welsh Water ahead of results due today sent the shares
tumbling 7 to 553p.
Tabloid wars continued with further falls in share prices, but analysts
generally forecast that they will prove to be just skirmishes and will not
have a lasting effect on earnings.
Centre of attention was United Newspapers, caught in the middle of a rights
issue and facing increasing speculation that The Sun's cut in price is not
so much an attack on the relatively buoyant Daily Mirror but an attempt to
knock the Daily Star out of business. It moved down 5 to 516p. Mirror Group
Newspapers eased 3 to 148p, Daily Mail &amp; General Trust 'A' fell Pounds 2 1/2
to Pounds 96 1/2 and Telegraph dipped 5 to 388p.
A mixture of profit-taking, some concern over BSkyB's expansion plans and
resurgence of VAT fears were blamed for the tumble of 18 in Pearson shares
to 442p. Volume was strong at 1.9m.
Banking issues remained firm ahead of the interim reporting season. Barclays
put on 4 at 485p, while Lloyds firmed 7 to 575p on suggestions that it would
soon sell its stake in Standard Chartered. A Pounds 200m Eurosterling issue
was well received by the market and Royal Bank of Scotland firmed 3 to 290p.
Rumours that Hoare Govett had downgraded Reed International, denied by the
broker, left the stock 12 down at 653p.
Container transport group Tiphook tumbled 27 to 259p after stating that
accounting changes had led to a loss of Pounds 21.8m, against profits of
Pounds 74.6m last year. But the company lifted the dividend to 19.3p from
17.3p.
The fall in copper prices saw international mining group RTZ slip 10 to
670p.
A shortage of stock in Laird Group sent the shares 15 higher to 314p. SG
Warburg and Kleinwort Benson were reported to be positive on British Steel,
which rose 3 1/2 to 100p in volume of 10m.
Profit-taking after its recent run brought British Aerospace down 7 to 420p.
Good results from HP Bulmer showed profits of Pounds 19.6m, above analysts'
expectations of Pounds 18.5m, and the stock rose 13 to 419p. The company
said its profits growth was driven by rising sales in cider markets in the
UK, Australia and Belgium. The UK cider market continued to expand, it
added, with sales volume climbing 12.4 per cent last year.

FT  15 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: Big Abbey turnover
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An agency cross in banking group Abbey National sent turnover soaring to 22m
shares, the day's highest total. Agency broker James Capel was believed to
have taken a block of 7m from an institution at 410p, passing it on to
several investors at 411p.
The stock has been weak since the tail end of last week when Robert Fleming
reiterated its negative stance on the stock, saying bad debt was too high
and thus the shares were overpriced. SG Warburg was also said to have turned
cautious earlier this week, removing the stock from its buy list to a hold
position. However, James Capel advised investors to buy on weakness. The
shares closed 5 lighter at 409p.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Credit Lyonnais Laing placed 5.88m of the nil-paid new ordinary shares in
computer software group ACT in a bought deal. The broker purchased the
shares from Singer &amp; Friedlander, the merchant bank, which decided not to
take up its rights.
ACT launched a four-for-13 rights issue at 123p a share to raise Pounds
50.9m as part of a Pounds 93.5m deal to buy the rival BIS Group. It is
thought that the broker bought the shares at around 32.5p apiece and sold
them to a variety of institutions at around 35.5p. The nil-paid closed 3 up
at 36p. The ordinary shares finished 8 off at 159p ex-dividend.

<TEXT>
Reports that Energis, the new telecommunications venture set up by the
National Grid, had told analysts that it would not be specifically targeting
Mercury customers when it launches its new business next year lifted Cable
and Wireless, Mercury's parent company.
Mercury was considered particularly vulnerable to Energis, which was
launched three months ago, because its customers had already changed once
from BT and could be prepared to do so again.
C&amp;W also benefited from buying in the US which had created a shortage in
ADRs. The shares advanced 7 to 770p. BT, which yesterday announced that the
BT3 public offer was oversubscribed, steadied at 410 1/2 p.

FT  15 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: Unilever dives
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Anglo-Dutch foods group Unilever recorded its biggest turnover for nearly
four years and a second day's steep decline as fears resurfaced over the
value of brands ahead of today's press conference on pricing strategy by
Procter &amp; Gamble.
Selected food manufacturing and drinks stocks weakened as investors took
fright at the prospect of price wars, particularly in markets where margins
are already under pressure. In Unilever's case this would apply to the
detergents business, where P&amp;G has indicated that it intends to bring
pressure to bear.
Unilever shares followed Monday's fall of 25 with a further drop of 24
yesterday to 953p. Turnover was a hefty 7.4m, its biggest since November
1989. Among other strong 'brand' groups, Cadbury-Schweppes weakened 9 to
439p, Tate &amp; Lyle 5 to 385p, Grand Metropolitan 6 to 409p and Guinness 13 to
454p.

FT  15 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: Standard rises on bid hint
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STRONG demand for Standard Chartered shares sent them sharply ahead to reach
an all-time high amid rumours of rights issues and takeovers. The stock
jumped 23 to 827p, although volume was thin at just under 1m shares traded.
A combination of mostly old stories surrounded the banking group. One was
that the Development Bank of Singapore was in the process of preparing to
make a takeover bid. Other stories included suggestions that the bank would
soon make a cash call and also that Lloyds Bank was considering the placing
of its 4.6 per cent stake in Standard, acquired during its abortive bid in
1986.

FT  15 JUL 93 / World Stock Markets (America): US shares post strong gains
as bond yields fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US SHARE prices posted strong gains yesterday as bond yields fell to record
lows following another set of bullish inflation figures, writes Patrick
Harverson in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 27.11 up at 3,542.55. The more
broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 gained 1.99 at 450.08, while the
American SE composite, which has outperformed other indices lately, finished
0.44 down at 438.67. The Nasdaq composite rose 4.02 to 712.49, a record
high. New York SE volume amounted to 297.4m shares.
Good inflation news and falling bond yields ended three days of weak,
indecisive trading. Equity prices climbed from the opening after the Labor
Department announced that its consumer price index was unchanged in June.
This delighted dealers and investors who, earlier this year, feared that
inflation was making a comeback. Analysts were particularly encouraged by
the paltry 0.1 per cent increase in the 'core' CPI, which excludes the
volatile food and energy components.
Not only was the CPI data good news in itself, but the figures spurred heavy
buying of Treasury securities. The demand lifted the benchmark 30-year bond
almost  3/4 point, sending the yield to below 6.6 per cent for the first
time since 1977, when the Treasury began issuing the 30-year bond on a
regular basis.
Equity investors like falling bond yields because they lower the cost of
borrowing for US corporations, and low interest rates can lure money away
from short-term assets and into shares.
Among individual stocks, second-quarter earnings continued to dominate
trading. General Electric moved up Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 98 5/8 after the
company announced a 10 per cent increase in quarterly earnings.
Federal Express jumped Dollars 6 1/2 to Dollars 53 3/8 on reporting a 56 per
cent improvement in fiscal fourth-quarter earnings. Another stock helped by
better than expected earnings was CBS, which put on Dollars 7 1/4 at Dollars
245.
Procter &amp; Gamble rose Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 52 1/2 as investors reacted
positively to news that the consumer products group is cutting its prices on
laundry products and dish soap by up to 15 per cent to compete with rival
brands and private labels.
Profit-taking continued to take its toll of brokerage issues, in spite of
some strong second-quarter earnings. Merrill Lynch fell a further Dollars 2
1/4 to Dollars 82 3/8 , PaineWebber declined Dollars 1 to Dollars 28, Morgan
Stanley lost Dollars 1 to Dollars 68 7/8 and Dean Witter Discover slipped
Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 35 5/8 .
On the Nasdaq market, Dell Computer dropped Dollars 3 3/8 to Dollars 15 7/8
in volume of 6m shares after the company forecast a second-quarter loss and
said it would make a pre-tax charge of between Dollars 75m and Dollars 85m
to cover the cost of a restruct-uring. The charge was considerably bigger
than analysts had expected.
Canada
TORONTO registered a modest decline in fairly heavy trading. The TSE 300
index ended 10 points off at 3,941.7 as falls outscored advances by 405 to
343. Volume was 61m shares valued at CDollars 800.3m.
The gold shares index fell 2.42 per cent as the New York bullion price lost
USDollars 3 an ounce. In that group, American Barrick dipped CDollars  7/8
to CDollars 31.

FT  15 JUL 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei eases as Pacific
Rim indices move narrowly
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SHARE prices moved in a narrow range following Tuesday's rise to above
20,000 for the Nikkei average, which closed marginally lower yesterday after
fluctuating on profit-taking and arbitrage buying, writes Emiko Terazono in
Tokyo.
The Nikkei was finally off 41.31 at 20,139.11, its first decline in four
trading days. It rose to a day's high of 20,207.52 just after the opening
but slipped later on arbitrage unwinding and profit-taking, setting a day's
low of 20,030.30.
Volume totalled 300m shares, against 331.7m. Rises led falls by 495 to 476,
with 186 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks shed
3.73 to 1,631.58. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index put on 1.09 at 1,240.37.
Equities were supported by hopes that monetary or fiscal support would be
implemented by the new government to be elected this weekend.
The new cabinet - probably a coalition around a core conservative party - is
likely to try to build support through income tax cuts. A fiscal stimulus
package is unlikely to be implemented, thought traders, due to the lack of a
kingpin figure to orchestrate the various interests of politicians and
ministries. The Bank of Japan, meanwhile, may be reluctant to cut the
official discount rate due to fears of reflation.
Mr Yasushi Ueki at Nikko Securities said that while a large loss by the
ruling Liberal Democratic party would damage investor sentiment, an
unexpected victory, on the other hand, would also be a negative factor for
shares. 'It will mean a return to the old corrupt ways,' he explained.
On the trading floor, Gajoen Kanko, a hotel and restaurant operator, was
suspended in the afternoon session due to reports that Dream, an unlisted
pachinko pinball operator which holds a large stake in Gajoen, had filed for
court protection under the bankruptcy law.
Gifu Bank, a regional bank in which Dream has a 5.5 per cent holding, fell
Y45 to Y535.
Kirin Brewery, the industry leader, lost Y20 to Y1,280 on reports that four
company officials had been arrested for paying off racketeers.
Profit-taking depressed bank shares, which gained on Tuesday on hopes of
credit easing. Industrial Bank of Japan retreated Y20 to Y3,130.
In Osaka, the OSE average dipped 31.47 to 22,157.43 in volume of 23.3m
shares.
Roundup
INDIVIDUAL equities and sectors moved more than indices on the Pacific Basin
markets.
AUSTRALIA saw strength in National Australia Bank, heavy trade in Woolworths
and profit-taking in golds bring the All Ordinaries index into balance at a
close just 0.3 higher at 1,804.5 in turnover of ADollars 348.8m.
National Australia finished 24 cents ahead at ADollars 10.30, after reaching
ADollars 10.32. Woolworths followed its successful market debut, topping the
active stocks list with 9.9m shares traded as it added a cent at ADollars
2.81. The gold shares index receded 13.5 to 2,202.2.
Market leader BHP appreciated 10 cents to ADollars 14.66. Salomon Brothers
recently made a strong buy recommendation on the stock, saying that its
improving balance sheet underpinned its ability to expand aggressively.
TAIWAN's turnover fell from TDollars 17.22bn to TDollars 15.35bn as the
weighted index finished 9.29 higher at 4,022.47. SEOUL closed virtually
flat, with the composite index just 0.2 firmer at 762.96 in turnover down
from Won478bn to Won424bn.
HONG KONG slipped a mere 0.60 to 6,955.50 as a bout of late selling wiped
out an earlier 73-point rise in the Hang Seng index. Turnover increased from
HKDollars 3.02bn to HKDollars 3.22bn.
There was local retail buying of Cheung Kong and Hutchison, but
institutional selling dragged both off their highs. Cheung Kong lost 30
cents to HKDollars 25.30 and Hutchison closed steady at HKDollars 20.30. Red
chips, or China-related stocks, were popular buys after being oversold
recently. Citic Pacific jumped 60 cents to HKDollars 16.
NEW ZEALAND lost ground after a sequence of highs, the NZSE-40 index
finishing 17.11 down at 1,706.62 in a turnover of NZDollars 26.3m.
Brewery concern Lion Nathan, which earlier announced a placing of 85m shares
at NZDollars 3.05, shed 10 cents to NZDollars 3.30, due in part to share
dilution but mostly because of the big discount involved.
SINGAPORE featured Tonhow Industries, a takeover target, which closed 36
cents stronger at SDollars 1.05. But the Straits Times Industrial index was
2.41 easier at 1,775.11.
BANGKOK fell for the third straight day, the SET index losing 7.68 at 892.98
in moderate turnover of Bt5.28bn.
MANILA's composite index shed 7.70 to 1,616.98, but the debut of Jollibee
Foods, the fast food chain, saw the shares climbing to above 16 pesos, a
premium of more than 80 per cent to the initial offer price.
COLOMBO saw demand for most Sri Lankan stocks, although turnover fell from
Rp180.7m to Rp104.5m as the All-share index moved forward 8.34 to 687.41.

FT  15 JUL 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Stet up 7% on telecoms
restructuring plan
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A SLIGHT easing of pressure on the French franc and a modest cut in the
German repo rate steadied nerves as attention turned to the Buba meeting
today. Paris was closed for a public holiday.
MILAN, encouraged by the long awaited statement on the restructuring of the
telecommunications sector, moved ahead, while technical trading ahead of
today's end of the monthly account also lifted prices.
The Comit index closed up 7.93 or 1.45 per cent to 553.66.
While the broad details of the restructuring of the telecoms sector has been
in the market for some time, the lack of other positive news recently has
focused investors' attention on this area, said Mr John Stewart of Milan
brokers, Pastorino.
Stet also gained on news of its five year convertible bond, convertible into
Sip savings shares. The stock rose L264 or 7.2 per cent to L3,910.
Italcable and Sip, which are to be merged by the end of the year to allow
the formation of Telecomm Italia on January 1, 1994, showed respective gains
of L316 and L86 to L7,890 and L2,811.
Reports that Fiat might be seeking to reduce its shareholding in Gemina, the
merchant bank, lifted the latter's price L38 to L1,380, while Fiat gained
L103 to L6,495.
FRANKFURT closed mixed, the DAX index rising 4.39 to 1,811.55 against a
day's high of 1,821.31. Interest rate cut hopes abated, but tomorrow's
expiry of equity options traded on the Deutsche Terminborse boosted interest
in some blue chips. Turnover was DM9.6bn.
Daimler rose DM9 to DM673 after two news items: first, that an S-class
revamp would produce a lighter, more fuel efficient car; and, secondly, on
the state of Bavaria's plan to sell its 8 per cent stake in the group's
Deutsche Aerospace subsidiary.
Metallgesellschaft added DM9.50 to recent gains which have taken it up by
nearly a quarter in less than a month. It was boosted by an announcement
from MG's Metall Mining Corp confirming rumours that it was considering
forming a new unit to hold its gold assets, dealers said. Mr David Morgan at
Lehman Brothers in London observed that MG is a reflection of base metal
prices, not a bull point, and a guide to the health of German manufacturing
industry, which is debatable.
In steels, Krupp Hoesch climbed DM7.10 to DM132.60 and Thyssen by DM5.20 to
DM212. Mr Morgan said that Thyssen has indicated that the worst is over in
its steel division and that Krupp Hoesch, highly-geared and in the midst of
very deep restructuring, is another bet on German economic recovery.
The energy, chemicals and metals group, Viag, rose DM6.80 to DM393.00 on the
confirmation that it would maintain its 1993 dividend; and Henkel, which
makes Persil, fell DM9.50 to DM550.20 although it said that it saw no
reasons for a global price war in detergents, following drastic price cuts
by Procter &amp; Gamble in the US.
AMSTERDAM returned to a positive stance in spite of a further sharp fall in
Unilever, down Fl 5.40 or 2.7 per cent to Fl 192.10. The CBS Tendency index
rose 0.2 to 117.1.
Hoare Govett called the market's reaction to news that Procter &amp; Gamble of
the US was to cut the list price of liquid detergents 'unjustified'. It said
that,in the short term,the impact of P &amp; G's strategy on Unilever's earnings
would be 'negligible', given the latter's aggressive promotion and
discounting of new products in the US.
Ahold, which has a strong US supermarket presence, lost Fl 1.10 to Fl 94.90
on the same story.
BRUSSELS noted a 12 per cent rise in Arbed, the Luxembourg-based steel
maker, up BFr380 to BFr3,500, while the Bel-20 index eased 0.41 lower to
1,328.13.
STOCKHOLM gathered ground for the seventh straight session, assisted by a
SKr13 rise in Ericsson B to SKr366. The Affarsvarlden general index rose
5.20 to 1,139.80.
DUBLIN extended its rally as retail investors bought into Bank of Ireland
before it goes ex rights today, and shares in the major Irish food
processors surged to new all-time highs on the back of positive sentiment
towards the sector.
The ISEQ overall index rose 15.78, or 1 per cent to 1,635.59, its financial
component putting in a 1.2 per cent per cent gain. In foods, said Mr Aidan
McGuire of Davy Stockbrokers, Avonmore's 3.5p rise to 167p left it up 10p on
the week on a combination of earnings and rating upgrades, while Greencore,
6.5p higher at 332.5p put itself 32.5p ahead of the placing price for the
Bank of Ireland stake of 9.6m shares earlier this week.

FT  15 JUL 93 / World Stock Markets: Europe and Middle East edge into lead
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN PITT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Performance in European and Middle Eastern emerging markets edged ahead of
Latin America last month, according to data supplied by the IFC, a part of
the World Bank.
Over the year so far, the former are even more impressive: up by nearly 60
per cent in dollar terms compared with a 5 per cent rise in Latin America
and Asia's 14 per cent.
Most of the gain in Europe/Middle East can be attributed to Turkey's
startling rally since January: in spite of weakness over the last week, the
market remains more than 100 per cent up on the year.
Within this region, Portugal has shown a reasonable advance over the year
although, as Baring Securities notes in a recent research document, the
market has been a disappointing performer since the Gulf war.
The broker comments that an overhaul of the market's structure since 1992 -
including the introduction of continuous trading and the establishment of a
central clearing house - has stimulated overseas interest.
Baring puts this together with falling interest rates and the devaluation of
the escudo, and forecasts a 'strong upside for equities over the next couple
of years'.
Mexico, which has lagged behind many of the world's emerging markets this
year, attracted the attention of Nomura this week. The global strategy team
recommends a switch of funds from France to Mexico, arguing that the
latter's upside potential seems more promising over the next six months.

FT  15 JUL 93 / Foreign Exchanges: No holiday for the ERM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHANIE FLANDERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SEVERAL European central banks spent the French Bastille Day holiday
intervening to support existing ERM parities, writes Stephanie Flanders.
Both the French franc and Danish krone were under persistent speculative
pressure yesterday, in spite of a limited cut in the German repo rate,
frequent intervention by the German, French, Danish and Dutch central banks
and a vow of support from France's President Mitterrand.
The Danish currency began the day at the bottom of the ERM grid. Traders
claimed that the Dutch and Danish governments had intervened in the market
repeatedly during the day. The krone closed at DKr3.8951 against the D-Mark,
only slightly above its floor of DKr3.9016. Also catching the markets'
attention was the Spanish peseta, which lost more than 1.5 pesetas against
the D-Mark to end at Pta78.70.
Many traders thought that the krone and the peseta had diverted speculators'
energies from the franc, but it was not left untouched. The French currency
lost ground during the night and in morning trading on European markets, at
times touching the FFr3.42 level against the D-Mark for the first time this
week.
Analysts were unimpressed with the 2 basis points reduction in the German
repo rate, taking it as a sign that there will be no cut in official German
rates at today's Bundesbank meeting. However, many market traders are still
looking for a German cut, and may react aggressively if this does not
transpire.
Frequent small but public interventions by the Bundesbank held the franc
within a FFr3.415 to FFr3.420 range. But the Bank of France also intervened,
using a large commercial bank as an intermediary to purchase francs outside
the country. The French unit closed in London at FFr3.417 per D-Mark, down
from Tuesday's FFr3.414.
In stark contrast to events on the Continent, sterling yesterday continued
to make steady gains against the dollar and the D-Mark. The pound finished
at Dollars 1.5025, nearly a cent higher than the previous close of Dollars
1.4935. It showed even more strength against the ERM currencies, gaining
nearly a pfennig to close at DM2.5775.
In recent months, a number of dealers have claimed that DM2.58 was an
important barrier. Although the pound may be experiencing some 'safe haven'
gains from developments in the ERM, many in the market consider the British
currency's recent strength to be long term. 'The rise in sterling is a
continuation of the effect of Tuesday's output figures,' commented one
London dealer. 'It is driven more by the all-round positive outlook for the
economy, than any temporary ERM excitement.'
The dollar weakened, with subdued US producer price figures and
profit-taking between them taking the US currency down from the previous
day's close of DM1.7200 to finish at DM1.7155. In New York it ended at
DM1.7160.

FT  15 JUL 93 / Money Markets: German rates ease
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHANIE FLANDERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bundesbank kept the markets guessing yesterday by combining a limited
cut in its repo rate with a generous injection of funds in this week's
tender, writes Stephanie Flanders.
The slight easing of monetary conditions brought German call money rates
down a fraction. Pressure on the French franc persisted, however, since few
now expect a more substantial loosening of policy at today's Bundesbank
council meeting.
In all, the German central bank injected an extra DM9.5bn of funds into the
domestic money markets. Traders had been ready to interpret any net addition
of more than DM7bn as a supportive gesture towards the French authorities.
However, most of the funds were allocated at 7.28 per cent, only 2 basis
points lower than last week's fixed repo rate of 7.30 per cent.
'The Bundesbank really only did all that it had to,' commented one
London-based trader. 'No repo rate reduction would have been tantamount to
hanging the franc out to dry.' In holiday trading by Paris commercial banks,
French one-month money market rates rose 20 basis points to 8.40 per cent,
although three-month rates were steady at 7.50 per cent.
In London, a large Pounds 2.55bn shortage which had been widely anticipated
proved easy to despatch. The Bank of England offered more than Pounds 2.1bn
in the first round, of which the majority was offered for repurchase.
Although this took some of the pressure off short rates, overnight rates
went as high as 6 3/4 per cent before falling to a low of 5 3/4 .
Elsewhere in sterling money markets, the news that British retail price
inflation for June had been the lowest for nearly 30 years helped to balance
the inflationary concern produced by yesterday's strong output data.
Three-month sterling money market rates stayed steady at 6 per cent.
Trading in sterling futures reflected the view that the combination of the
output and inflation figures left the British government in a position to
cut interest rates at its leisure.
'It is still almost 99.9 per cent certain that interest rates will fall
before the end of the year,' said a London analyst. 'But there is
considerably more upside potential for a cut before December than before
September, because the politicians are in a position to play it long.'
The September and December sterling contracts rose nearly 10 basis points in
the morning, before finishing a net 5 basis points up at around 94.21 and
94.44 respectively.

FT  15 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: France samples home-grown
petrol - An unusual use for sugar and cereal products
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PUT a sugar beet in your tank. Nigel Mansell did, with good effect. The
British racing driver won last year's Portuguese grand prix in a
Williams-Renault car running on a mixture of ordinary petrol and a
biocarburant known as ETBE produced in France.
Such 'green petrol' is now becoming increasingly available to ordinary
French motorists and the opinion polls show that they are more than happy to
use it.
Since April Elf-Aquitaine's Feyzin refinery near Lyons has been producing
ETBE, or ethyl-tertio-butyl-ether. The product is a mixture of ethanol, made
from sugar beet or cereals, and isobutane, an industrial product. With a
capacity to make 75,000 tonnes a year, the Feyzin refinery can produce
enough ETBE to put 5 per cent of the biocarburant in all the company's
unleaded petrol.
To begin with Elf just added ETBE to the petrol it sold in the Rhone-Alpes
region around Feyzin, with no publicity. But emboldened by positive
soundings from opinion polls the oil company is now openly marketing its
ETBE mix of petrol, from specially marked pumps, in the departments of
Seine-et-Marne and Essonne to the south of Paris.
A form of green diesel is also coming on to the French market. It contains a
methylester made from rape seed oil, which is added to standard diesel fuel.
It was developed in the early 1980s by a company called Sofiproteol, under
the trade mark name of Diester, to which Elf bought the exclusive
distribution rights.
There are now several producers of the generic product, rape oil
methylester, but so far it has only been sold to 'captive fleets'. Shell
France, for instance, announced this month that it would be supplying the
354-bus fleet of Caen in Normandy with diesel composed of one-third rape oil
methylester. However, with the commercial advantage of the Diester brand
name, Elf now plans to market it more widely.
Developing green oil is an old dream for farm-rich but energy-poor France.
But the idea has been driven forward by last year's reform of the European
Community's Common Agricultural Policy, particularly with its requirement
that all but the smallest farmers must take 15 per cent of their land out of
food production. In theory such a move could render 1.3m hectares idle in
France. But, according to Mr Jean-Pierre Le Roudier, who runs the
Association for the Development of Agricultural Carburants, 1m hectares of
that land could produce enough to put 5 per cent of ETBE in petrol and 5 per
cent of rape oil methylester in diesel - and in the process minimise
farmers' loss of income.
The French government has done its bit. Since last year biocarburants have
been exempt from the standard petrol and diesel tax, and that has at last
made the green fuels competitive. In February a government-commissioned
report by Mr Raymond Levy, former president of Renault, came out broadly in
favour of continued public support for biocarburants, although he drew
complaints from sugar beet producers (whose products go into ethanol, the
base for petrol additives) that he was biased in favour of the rape oil
additives for diesel.
But cost is crucial, says Mr Alain Guillon, Elf's head of refining and
marketing. 'We are ready to go on producing Diester, provided it is
competitive with diesel, and to use ethanol for ETBE, provided it is
competitive with methanol.'
Elf started importing methanol in 1986 to produce MTBE
(methyl-tertio-butyl-ether) to give petrol back the octane rating that it
loses from the elimination of lead. But three years ago the company started
tests to see what it could do if it replaced the imported methanol with
home-grown ethanol.
One thing it decided not to do was to inject pure ethanol into petrol, as
had been done widely in the US. Mr Jean-Paul Lemonde, the Feyzin refinery
director, explains that the main problem with pure ethanol is that it is
soluble in water and therefore more prone to contaminate and be
contaminated. ETBE does not have that disadvantage. Mr Pierre Varriot, head
of Feyzin's steamcracker unit, admits that 'isobutane is a bit harder to mix
with ethanol than methanol but we have proved industrially that ETBE works'.
Elf 'wanted to be ready with all the technical solutions, when the farmers
asked for help last year', Mr Guillon says. The oil company does big
business with France's 1m-strong farming community, which it did not want to
jeopardise. But he cautions that growing biocarburants is by no means a
total solution to French farmers' problems. That caution was echoed in the
Levy report which calculated that putting 5 per cent of biocarburants in all
French fuels would only create 8,000 to 10,000 new jobs, half of them
outside farming.
Furthermore, Mr Guillon warns that 'all our strategy is reversible. If, for
instance, the tax exemption were to disappear, then we would go back to
importing methanol as a petrol additive and we would forget about adding
rape oil into diesel'. That is why French biocarburant producers are keen to
see progress on the 1992 proposal by Mrs Christiane Scrivener, the EC tax
commissioner, for a 90 per cent reduction in excise taxes on green fuels
across the Community. Such a move would not only help any French exports but
would also help lock the current French tax exemption in place.
Belgium, whose own oil company, Petrofina, broadly favours biocarburant
development, has promised to make the Scrivener proposal a priority of its
EC presidency in the second half of this year. But EC tax proposals need
unanimity to pass. Behind the reticence of several governments to the tax
plan are environmentalists who argue that biocarburants pollute as much as
fossil fuels, though in different form, and oil companies like British
Petroleum and Esso, who claim that aiding natural ethanol will hurt the
market for sythetic ethanols.

FT  15 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Nickel market likely to
overcome current problems, analysts say
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ABOUT one-quarter of the western world's primary nickel capacity is
suffering losses at present London Metal Exchange prices, according to the
AME Mineral Economics consultancy group.
However, AME and other analysts suggest that longer-term prospects for
nickel are good, despite the short-term problems. The outlook 'is probably
better than for any of the other major base metals, with the possible
exception of aluminium', says Billiton-Enthoven Metals, part of the Royal
Dutch/Shell group.
Commenting on the immediate outlook, Rudolf Wolff, part of the Noranda
natural resources group, suggests in its latest nickel report that prices
are likely to drift down to Dollars 4,800 a tonne or Dollars 2.18 a pound.
That is because the rate of exports from the Commonwealth of Independent
States can be expected to increase but production of stainless steel, the
biggest consumer of nickel, is likely to fall in the second half of 1993
after a strong first-half rise of 5 per cent.
AME points out that at Dollars 2.60 a lb - the price at the end of 1992 -
seven of the production units it monitors would have been operating at a
cash break-even point or worse.
According to AME, the highest-cost operators in 1992 were the Brazilian
ferronickel producers with cash costs of Dollars 3.56-Dollars 4.01 a lb,
followed by Larco in Greece at Dollars 3.45 and Societe Metallurgique le
Nickel's Sandouville refinery in France at Dollars 3.00. Glenbrook's Riddle
operation in the US had cash costs of Dollars 2.78, and those at Empress
Nickel's Eiffel Flats refinery in Zimbabwe were Dollars 2.70. Costs at
Queensland Nickel's Yabulu operation in Australia were Dollars 2.56 a lb.
The lowest-cost product was nickel oxide from the Matsuzuka refinery in
Japan at Dollars 1.14 a lb. The refinery was supplied by Inco's Ontario
mines and the Copper Cliff smelter.
Among the big producers, the lowest-cost producers last year were Western
Mining in Australia with estimated cash costs of Dollars 1.60; Inco's
Canadian Thompson smelter at Dollars 1.71 and Copper Cliff at Dollars 2.06;
and Clydach UK at Dollars 2.23. Falconbridge of Canada, at Dollars 2.10, was
the highest-cost producer among the five big producers.
AME's study predicts that refined nickel output in the western world should
bottom out at 550,000 tonnes this year, after 592,000 tonnes in 1992. Demand
is expected to rise to 630,000 tonnes this year, up from 617,000 tonnes.
Analysts believe net imports to the west from the eastern bloc - mainly from
Russia but also from Cuba - will continue at a relatively high level. AME
suggests those imports will total 95,000 tonnes this year, down from 112,000
tonnes.
In its latest study of the nickel market, Billiton points out that new
imports from the eastern bloc accounted for 18 per cent of total consumption
in 1991 and 1992. 'While we believe that, for a variety of reasons, exports
from the CIS to the west will decline over the next few years, we
nevertheless conclude that they will remain substantial in volume for the
foreseeable future. On the other hand, exports from the west to China will
probably continue to increase. On balance, however, the west will remain a
significant net importer of nickel.'
Billiton says primary nickel production in the west will fall by 30,000
tonnes from its 1992 record of 595,000 tonnes but, because of the imports, a
supply surplus will remain. Billiton forecasts an average price of Dollars
2.60 a lb for 1993, Dollars 3.25 for next year and Dollars 4.00 for 1995.
Rudolf Wolff expects CIS exports to be about 80,000 tonnes this year and to
lead to a supply surplus of 10,000 tonnes. It suggests prices above Dollars
5,300 a tonne (Dollars 2.40 a lb) are likely to be 'capped' by this surplus
supply.

FT  15 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Norway increases gas supplies
to Germany
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NORWAY is to increase its supplies of natural gas to Germany by 3.5bn cubic
metres a year, and has secured a price rise for gas from the giant Troll
field.
The additional supplies will increase the value of Norway's gas sales to
Germany by an estimated 3bn Norwegian kroner (Pounds 275m) a year.
Ruhrgas of Germany has agreed to purchase an additional 2bn cu m of
Norwegian gas a year and to exercise 50 per cent of a purchase option
covering 1.5bn cu m a year from the Troll field. With half of the Troll
purchase option exercised, Ruhrgas could exercise an option for a further
1.5bn cu m a year, but this would have to be decided by July 1 1995. Other
companies with outstanding Troll purchase options, covering 5.4bn cu m of
gas, include Germany's Thyssengas and BEB, Distrigaz of Belgium and Ferngas
of Austria.
Under yesterday's deal, Norway's annual gas supplies to Germany will
increase from 9bn cu m a year now to 22bn in the year 2005, of which 14.2bn
cu m will be purchased by Ruhrgas. The share of Norwegian gas in Germany's
overall supplies will be lifted from 14 per cent to more than 25 per cent by
2005.
A consortium of German gas buyers, including Ruhrgas, has also agreed to a
price adjustment for Troll gas, which was priced at an estimated NKr0.70 per
cubic metre under the original sales agreement in 1986. The price rise marks
the end of a dispute between the Germans and Norway's gas negotiating
committee, which has lasted for more than a year.
Under the terms of the original Troll contract, representatives of both
sides were entitled to demand a price review before deliveries of the gas
commenced. The Troll producers exercised that right, seeking a higher price
for the gas, which also included supplies from the Statfjord, Heimdal, and
Gullfaks fields. However, under the price review, negotiations are still
outstanding between Norway and buyers in the Netherlands, Belgium, Austria
and France.
With the additional purchases by Germany, total Norwegian gas supplies to
Europe under the Troll contract will reach 44.7bn cu m by 2005.

FT  15 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: EC proposes to extend ban on
BST hormone
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Commission yesterday presented plans to extend its
four-year-old ban on the dairy hormone bovine somatrophin (BST) by a further
seven years - mainly because the hormone's use would drive smaller dairy
farmers out of business.
The commission's predominantly economic rationale for seeking a ban on the
productivity-boosting hormone is based on fears that its use could disrupt
finely balanced calculations for the beef and dairy sector, under last
year's reform of the EC's common agricultural policy.
The commission admitted it could not fault BST conclusively on veterinary,
health or ethical grounds, although it pointed out that monitoring the
effects of a hormone used on such a large scale could not be properly
enforced.
It argued, however, that BST, which delivers milk productivity increases of
6-20 per cent, would have the effect of concentrating milk output on larger
holdings, driving smaller farmers out of business and leading to the more
intensive farming that the CAP reform seeks to discourage.
Such a development would lead to increased slaughtering of dairy cows - 4-6
per cent of the EC herd, the commission said - adding to the already chronic
oversupply of beef.
Moreover, the commission argued, consumer reaction against hormones was now
so pronounced that authorisation of BST would lead to further declines in
beef and dairy product consumption, adding to market imbalances. Mr Rene
Steichen, EC agriculture commissioner, said it would 'tarnish the image of a
product now considered natural and wholesome'.
BST was developed largely by US multinatonals like Monanto and Eli Lilly.
The US Senate has recently voted for a 15-month moratorium on its use.
Extending the EC ban on the hormone will have to gain the approval of the
council of agricultural ministers.

COPPER prices staged a substantial recovery yesterday after sustaining heavy
falls earlier in the week. Dealers attributed the rise, which lifted the
three months position at the London Metal Exchange by Dollars 43 to Dollars
1,921.50 at the close, mainly to technical factors, notably Far Eastern
options buying and tightness around the three months delivery period. But
they saw little in the way of fundamental demand to sustain the market and
thought it could be 'riding for a fall' when the tightness wore off.
ALUMINIUM also rallied, the three months price closing Dollars 27.25 up at
Dollars 1,203.50 a tonne, aided by spill-over sentiment from copper and
expectations of strong support below Dollars 1,200. At the London Commodity
Exchange robusta COFFEE prices edged lower in nervous conditions as traders
waited to see if frost warnings in Brazil would be justified. After London's
close New York's arabica coffee market continued to decline. COCOA values
were firmer at the LCE on trade buying in London and speculative buying in
New York. The September price closed at Pounds 759 a tonne, up Pounds 11 on
the day.

</HEADLINE>

The market continues inactive with prices untested at auction during the
recess between the main selling seasons. The trade has been encouraged by
large sales from the Australian stockpile last week - more than 12,000 bales
and the largest weekly total since early December. These are related to
Australian business with China and if further demand develops from one of
Australia's main wool customers the outlook for the whole market next season
is more hopeful. In the UK, problems related to the marketing of British
wool persist.

FT  15 JUL 93 / Government Bonds: Gilt prices leap ahead as inflation falls
to 30-year low
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN and PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ECONOMIC data showing the lowest inflation for almost 30 years sent UK
government bond prices shooting upwards and yields dropping below 8 per cent
for the first time in more than 20 years.
The yield on ultra-long gilts maturing in 2017 fell to 7.98 per cent with
prices leaping forward by a full percentage point, building on the strong
rally that has been developing since May. Long-dated yields have not been
sustainably below 8 per cent since 1968.
The rise in prices at first reflected a technical readjustment by
marketmakers, but the shift was sustained by heavy interest from domestic
funds, which have been shy of the gilt market compared with their overseas
equivalents.
UK funds have feared a return to the 'boom-bust' economics of the past two
decades but there is a growing belief that low inflation might have taken
hold.
Mr Chris Anthony, UK economist with UBS, said the data showing headline
inflation down to only 1.2 per cent were 'totally contrary to the consensus
and reinforced the bullish argument for gilts at the long end.' Another
economist said: 'We have economic recovery with no inflationary pressure.'
Short-dated government bond yields, reflecting the market's expectations on
interest rates, remained virtually unchanged because the latest improved
manufacturing output data pushed back hopes for monetary easing.
Meanwhile, the Bank of England announced an additional Pounds 700m tranche
of existing 7 1/4 per cent stock maturing in 1998; the partly-paid issue was
priced at 102 1/4 and the issue will be available today.
The Bank also announced the issue of Pounds 300m in tranches of index-linked
bonds, consisting of Pounds 100m of 2 1/2 per cent index-linked stock due
2003 and Pounds 200m of 4 1/8 per cent index-linked due 2030.
SURPRISINGLY generous supply from the German central bank at its weekly repo
sent strong signals that the Bundesbank was keen to cut interest rates again
and pushed government bond prices higher. Bund futures for September rose
0.24 to 96.27.
Commercial banks needed DM68.5bn to cope with their day-to-day management.
The market had been expecting around DM72bn as a gesture of goodwill, and
the final figure of DM78bn at 7.28 per cent and above surprised most
analysts.
Ms Alison Cottrell, economist with Midland Global Markets, argued that the
recent intervention to support the French franc made the oversupply even
more generous.
The Bundesbank has been buying francs for D-Marks fairly aggressively over
the past two days. This has shifted more German money to the commercial
banks and might have encouraged the central bank to maintain a tighter hold
on supply.
Nevertheless, there is a consensus that the Bundesbank is unlikely to cut
rates at its council meeting today and will prefer to wait until its next
meeting, its last before the summer recess, in a fortnight's time.
DISAPPOINTING money supply figures put pressure on Spanish government bonds
yesterday. There was further pressure from a weak peseta as the strains
within the European exchange rate mechanism grew and the September Bonos
futures contract fell 0.33 to 92.42.
CONTINUING pressure on the French franc sent the currency to within a
centime of its floor against the D-Mark, but the French government bond
market was closed for the Bastille Day holiday.
US Treasury prices rose strongly at the long end of the market yesterday,
sending yields to new record lows, following a bullish consumer prices
report.
In late trading the benchmark 30-year government bond was up at 107 5/16 ,
yielding 6.559 per cent. At the short end of the market, the two-year note
was also firmer, up  3/32 at 100 9/32 , to yield 3.957 per cent.
After the market produced a muted response to good producer prices data on
Tuesday, yesterday there was no doubt about dealers' and investors'
attitudes to the consumer prices figures. The consumer prices index for June
was unchanged, and the 'core' measure (excluding food and energy prices) was
up only 0.1 per cent last month.
The figures confirmed that after several months of worryingly high inflation
at the start of the year, inflationary pressures in the economy have abated.
Bond prices moved higher after the CPI was released, and the 30-year yield
dropped below 6.6 per cent.

FT  15 JUL 93 / International Bonds: Abbey National leads flock of issuers
with Pounds 350m offer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BORROWERS flocked to the international bond markets again in a wide range of
currencies, astonishing many market participants with the deluge of new
issues.
Yesterday saw the launch of several large deals from corporate names
including Abbey National, Royal Bank of Scotland, Rolls-Royce and Hoechst.
Abbey National Treasury Services launched a Pounds 350m tranche of
Eurosterling bonds, taking the total size of its existing 10-year issue up
to Pounds 1bn. The move creates the largest corporate Eurosterling issue,
matching the EIB's 10-year deal in size.
Mr Jonathan Nicolls, director of corporate and capital markets at Abbey
National, pointed out that while the UK bank obviously requires sterling
funding, it is also keen to establish 'a genuine benchmark' in the
Eurosterling market.
He added: 'There has been a lot of demand for 10-year paper in last four
weeks and I was keen to respond to that.' The demand stems from the fact
that many foreign investors are interested in sterling paper because of the
attractive yields compared with other European markets and the perception
that UK interest rates should fall further.
Abbey National swapped the deal into floating rate sterling to achieve
funding at around Libor plus 20-25 basis points.
The original Pounds 650m 10-year tranche launched in March was priced to
yield 50 basis points over the gilt. Since then, the yield spread has fallen
to about 36-37 basis points in the secondary market. Yesterday's tranche was
priced to yield 40 basis points over the gilt, and the bonds rose on the
back of the gilt market's rally, from 99.47 to 100.20-100.35, according to
one of the lead managers.
Royal Bank of Scotland also tapped the sterling sector, issuing a Pounds
200m perpetual sub-ordinated bond issue which qualifies as upper Tier Two
capital.
The bonds have a coupon of 9.5 per cent. However, after 25 years (and
provided the bonds are not called) the coupon will be set at whichever is
higher - either 9.5 per cent or 237.5 basis points above the five-year
benchmark gilt yield. The coupon will be reset in this manner at five-yearly
intervals.
The deal was sold mainly to insurance companies and pension funds which have
long-dated liabilities, as well as to some bond funds.
The Eurodollar sector saw heavy issuance with a Dollars 500m, seven-year
deal from Hoechst, the chemicals group, and a Dollars 300m, 10-year deal
from Rolls-Royce. The Rolls-Royce issue was increased from Pounds 250m due
to good demand.

FT  15 JUL 93 / International Capital Markets: Milan to trade 41 more shares
on computer system
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SCREEN-based share trading on the Milan stock exchange will receive its
biggest boost tomorrow when 41 more shares move to the computer-based
system.
The switch, which will include some of Italy's most heavily-traded equities
such as Generali and Stet, takes to 80 the number of shares traded since
screen-based trading made its cautious debut with just five stocks in
November 1991.
Since then, the system has been gradually expanded, with the biggest boost
coming with the addition of 25 new shares in May 1992. Despite the cautious
growth, the system has suffered from severe technical setbacks, although
trading has been smooth in recent months.
Increasing the number of shares to 80 means the screen-based system will
account for about 70 per cent of the total capitalisation of the Milan
bourse and 80 per cent of average daily trading volumes.
The expansion is being accompanied by the introduction of a new index, the
Mibtel, which could in time form the basis for futures and options trading
on Italian equities.
The Mibtel, which will be calculated every 15 minutes at the outset but will
be calculated every minute eventually, marks the stock exchange's first
real-time equity index.
Its introduction is a further step in the long-overdue efforts to put
Italy's financial markets on a par with developments now commonplace
elsewhere in Europe.
This year the bourse appointed a new ruling council, chaired by Mr Attilio
Ventura, to improve transparency.
No timetable has been set for futures contracts or options on futures.
However, having a real-time index covering a large portion of the market is
an essential pre-condition for their introduction.
Broad legislation for futures and options on equities was approved along
with a packet of other bourse reforms in January 1992.
The new index comes just a few days after Banca Commerciale Italiana (BCI),
which calculates the popular Comit index, widely followed by foreign
investors, launched a new 30-share product based on stocks traded on-screen.
Consob, Italy's stock market and companies watchdog, which has been
supervising the introduction of screen-based trading, has plans to shift the
bulk of share dealing to the screen-based system by the end of this year.
However, there is no fixed timetable, and regulators will be monitoring
carefully the latest expansion of the system before moving further.
The growing interest in Italian equities has prompted Morgan Stanley
International and Banca Commerciale Italiana to launch an issue of put and
call warrants on the Italian BCI-30 index.
The index, recently constructed by BCI, is composed of the 30 largest and
most liquid Italian shares. It is designed to have a high correlation to the
Italian stock market, although with slightly higher volatility. BCI will
calculate the index on a real-time basis.
The warrant issue consists of three tranches each of puts and calls, with
American-style expiration. All will have a two-year maturity, to August 16,
1995. Issue prices will be fixed on the basis of market prices on July 16.
Application has been made to list the warrants for trading in Luxembourg.

acquisition

LION NATHAN, the New Zealand-based brewing and soft drinks group, announced
yesterday that it may be about to mount a takeover bid for the brewing
business of Australia's SA Brewing group.
Lion is raising NZDollars 260m (USDollars 143m) through a private placing of
equity, and yesterday's prospectus said the proceeds would be used to reduce
debt and support the possible acquisition of the brewing operations of SA
Brewing Holdings.
Mr Douglas Myers, chief executive, said his company, already the biggest
brewer in Australia with some 40 per cent of the beer market, was tendering
to buy the assets.
A spokesman said Lion had had extensive talks with institutions in
Australia. He said that it was interested in SA Brewing, but that the price
would 'have to be right'.
SA Brewing would make no comment yesterday.
The company has consistently declined to comment on reports that it is
planning to sell its brewing operations, which have been valued at up to
ADollars 350m (USDollars 238m).
The group has suffered sluggish profits recently as a result of poor beer
and packaging trading. For the six months to December, net earnings were
just 1.1 per cent ahead at ADollars 57.15m, although the outlook for the
second half was said to be favourable.
In March, when announcing a big jump in half-year profits, Lion forecast
satisfactory full-year profits but said tougher competition and difficult
trading conditions in the Australian beer market would be a challenge.
Boosted by an acquisition, Lion's net profits for the six months to February
rose 73 per cent to NZDollars 79.5m.

FT  15 JUL 93 / International Company News: Westinghouse income falls 18%

<TEXT>
WESTINGHOUSE Electric, the US conglomerate trying to recover from poor
property investments, yesterday reported an 18 per cent drop in second
quarter income from continuing operations, which it acknowledged was below
its expectations.
The company blamed the drop mainly on the performance of its environmental
business, which it said had been hit by 'weakness in the US environmental
remediation market and the poor European economies'.
Mr Michael Jordan, chief executive, said Westinghouse was in the 'midst of a
great transition'.
Westinghouse reported net income from continuing operations of Dollars 84m,
or 20 cents a share, compared with Dollars 103m, or 30 cents, in the same
period of last year. Revenues were Dollars 1.98bn, compared with Dollars
2.18bn.
The company is gradually getting out of financial services, and in
particular property investment. It said that in the second quarter it had
sold Dollars 2.3bn in assets, for cash, from its financial services business
and more than Dollars 3bn in the first half of the year, and this
essentially eliminated the company's exposure from commercial property
assets.
For the six months, Westinghouse reported income from continuing operations
of Dollars 148m, or 35 cents a share, compared with Dollars 168m, or 68
cents, in the same period of last year.

<TEXT>
ALCAN ALUMINIUM, the Canadian aluminium group, faced with weaker ingot and
fabricated product prices, posted a second-quarter loss of USDollars 35m, or
18 cents a common share, against a loss of Dollars 29m, or 15 cents, a year
earlier.
Sales and operating revenues for the quarter were 5 per cent lower at
Dollars 1.86bn.
For the first six months, Alcan's loss deepened to Dollars 55m, or 29 cents
a share, compared with a deficit of Dollars 44m, or 24 cents, a year
earlier. First-half sales and operating revenues were Dollars 3.6bn, against
Dollars 3.8bn.
Second-quarter fabricated products volumes were stable but realised prices
were down 9 per cent. Ingot shipments were slightly higher but prices were
down 10 per cent.
The lower prices were partly offset by cost reductions and a weaker Canadian
dollar. Interest costs were also lower.
Total shipments of ingot and fabricated products in the second quarter were
641,000 tonnes, against 610,000 tonnes, and in the first half roughly the
same at 1.22m tonnes.
In Canada, where most of Alcan's primary production is located, losses were
up in the quarter while US operations posted a loss, compared with a small
profit in the 1992 period.

CELANESE Canada, the synthetic fibre and chemical products group controlled
by Germany's Hoechst, said first half profits quadrupled from a year earlier
because of strength in textiles and industrial products and a lower Canadian
dollar. The pace of growth is expected to hold throughout 1993.
Net profit was CDollars 28.2m (USDollars 22m), or CDollars 2.06 a share, up
from CDollars 7.3m, or 50 cents, a year earlier, on sales of CDollars 213m
against CDollars 207m.
Second-quarter earnings were CDollars 15.5m, or CDollars 1.14, against a

CDollars 117m.

FT  15 JUL 93 / International Company News: Laidlaw will not take up ADT
shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LAIDLAW, the Ontario-based waste services and transport operator, will not
take up its proportionate share of the forthcoming public equity issue by
ADT, its 28.4 per cent-owned international security and vehicle auction
affiliate.
The decision will lower Laidlaw's stake to just over 25 per cent, which will
still leave the Canadian company as ADT's biggest single shareholder.
Mr Donald Jackson, Laidlaw chief executive, said yesterday he supported
ADT's refinancing effort, but that Laidlaw's resources were best spent on
its own core businesses.
ADT plans to issue 18m shares in the US. At its current share price of
Dollars 9 on the New York Stock Exchange, the issue will raise about Dollars
160m.
Laidlaw's shares have tumbled by almost 20 per cent since it surprised the
investment community last week with a loss of Dollars 33.6m, or 12 cents a
share, for the three months to May 31. The loss was chiefly due to a Dollars
120m writedown stemming from a review of its US solid waste operations.
The shares closed at CDollars 8 on the Toronto stock exchange yesterday,
down 88 cents.
Mr Jackson forecast earnings of 6 to 8 cents a share in the current quarter,
slightly below analysts' estimates. He acknowledged that 'environmental
services markets are going through a period of consolidation and
restructuring'.

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US Federal Trade Commission yesterday formally dropped its three-year
investigation into unfair trading practices at Intel, the world's largest
manufacturer of semiconductors.
The news came after the market had closed and was too late to reverse a
Dollars 1 1/8 fall in the company's share price, to Dollars 53 3/8 , in the
wake of second-quarter figures announced on Monday.
In a letter to Intel president Mr Andrew Grove, Ms Mary Lou Steptoe, acting
director of the FTC's bureau of competition, said of its investigation: 'On
further review of this matter, it now appears that no further action is
warranted by the Commission. Accordingly . . . the investigation is closed.'
The FTC, which has never previously confirmed the existence of the
investigation, said that it had looked into possible 'unlawful tying or
exclusive dealing practices or other unfair methods of competition'
involving the marketing, distribution and sale of the company's
microprocessors and other computer parts.
The company, which has a large share of the market for microprocessors for
personal computers, continues to face private anti-trust actions brought by
two of its competitors.
Mr Tom Dunlap, general counsel to Intel, welcomed the FTC decision, adding
that the company intended to continue with its 'very aggressive, but very
fair intellectual property programme'.
The investigation had cost the company 'many millions of dollars,' he said,
but had not resulted in any changes in business policy.
The decision to end the investigation had been generally expected in the
market. Mr Dunlap expressed confidence that the decision would lead to the
ending of private actions brought against the company, since these had been
based on the same documents that the company had disclosed to the FTC.

FT  15 JUL 93 / International Company News: Royal Trustco to bail out share
scheme executives
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE PARENT company of Royal Trust, the Canadian financial institution
controlled by the Bronfman family whose operations are being sold to Royal
Bank of Canada, will spend about CDollars 20m (USDollars 15.6m) on life
insurance policies to bail 151 managers out of an executive compensation
scheme which went badly awry.
Royal Bank has refused to employ any RT managers unless they are relieved of
all obligations under a share purchase plan, which forced them as a
condition of employment to buy large parcels of shares in Royal Trustco,
RT's parent company. The purchases were financed by corporate loans.
The idea of the scheme was that the managers would augment their salaries
with handsome capital gains as RT's profits improved and the share price
appreciated. Dividends would be used to pay interest on the loans.
Instead of improving, business has gone into reverse, however. Earlier this
year Mr Hartland MacDougall, RT chairman, announced that losses for 1992
were in the region of CDollars 900m. The share price of Royal Trustco, which
recently changed its name to Gentra, has collapsed from a peak of more than
CDollars 19 in 1989 to 37 cents.
Many RT managers faced financial ruin if their loans were called in under
the original terms of the purchase plan. Their total indebtedness under the
scheme is CDollars 53.5m.
Gentra now plans to extend the term of the loans for up to 70 years. The
loans will be payable only if the shares rise above the original purchase
price, or when the participant dies. In the latter event, the participant's
obligations will be covered by the insurance policy.
The bailout does not apply to 74 employees, with loans totalling CDollars
21m, who will not remain with RT after its sale to Royal Bank.
Similar compensation plans have been in force at other companies controlled
by Toronto's Bronfman family. But the share prices of these companies have
generally performed better than Royal Trustco, and fewer employees have been
involved in the share purchase schemes.
None the less, several of the Bronfmans' most senior executives have
received large loans to relieve them of the burden of falling share prices.

acquisition

<TEXT>
LION NATHAN, the New Zealand-based brewing and soft drinks group, announced
yesterday that it may be about to mount a takeover bid for the brewing
business of Australia's SA Brewing group.
Lion is raising NZDollars 260m (USDollars 143m) through a private placing of
equity, and yesterday's prospectus said the proceeds would be used to reduce
debt and support the possible acquisition of the brewing operations of SA
Brewing Holdings.
Mr Douglas Myers, chief executive, said his company, already the biggest
brewer in Australia with some 40 per cent of the beer market, was tendering
to buy the assets.
A spokesman said Lion had had extensive talks with institutions in
Australia. He said that it was interested in SA Brewing, but that the price
would 'have to be right'.
SA Brewing would make no comment yesterday. 'We don't intend to make a
statement on it,' said Mr John Morton, SA Brewing's company secretary.
The company has consistently declined to comment on reports that it is
planning to sell its brewing operations, which have been valued at up to
ADollars 350m (USDollars 238m).
The group has suffered sluggish profits recently as a result of poor beer
and packaging trading. For the six months to December, net earnings were
just 1.1 per cent ahead at ADollars 57.15m, although the outlook for the
second half was said to be favourable.
In March, when announcing a big jump in half-year profits, Lion forecast
satisfactory full-year profits but said tougher competition and difficult
trading conditions in the Australian beer market would be a challenge.
Boosted by an acquisition, Lion's net profits for the six months to February
rose 73 per cent to NZDollars 79.5m. Mr Myers said 3.6 percentage points of
its key market share in New South Wales had been lost during the period.
Lion's share of the beer market was 40.7 per cent in Australia and 58.2 per
cent in New Zealand.
The share placing is being made at NZDollars 3.05. It involves the issue of
49.8m new shares, representing 10 per cent of Lion, and the sale of 35.2m
shares from its treasury.
Mr Myers said the move would significantly strengthen Lion's balance sheet.
He said a more conservative balance sheet and greater Australian
institutional support would form a strong base for growth.
'Over 70 per cent of our assets are located in Australia. We wish to
increase the level of ownership by Australian institutions,' he said.

INTERNATIONAL Paper, the US forest products group, reported a 29.9 per cent
downturn in underlying second-quarter earnings, reflecting slow growth in
domestic markets and weak overseas economies.
The company warned that weakness in European and export markets would
probably continue in the second half.
Net income for the three months to June 30 was Dollars 77m, or 62 cents a
share, on sales of Dollars 3.5bn compared with earnings of Dollars 112m, or
92 cents, on sales of Dollars 3.4bn a year earlier.
Interest costs were considerably higher in the 1993 period, and in the 1992
quarter International Paper had benefited from tax-related interest income
and higher capitalised interest attributable to two important European
projects.
Stripping out income taxes, extraordinary items and the cumulative effect of
accounting changes, International Paper earned Dollars 122m in the quarter
against Dollars 174m a year earlier.
For the first six months, net income was Dollars 141m, or Dollars 1.14 a
share, on sales of Dollars 6.9bn, against profits of Dollars 164m, or
Dollars 1.36, on sales of Dollars 6.7bn in the same period of 1992.
Packaging operations saw sales decline to Dollars 890m from Dollars 925m,
but the company's other leading business segments posted improved sales.
Mr John Georges, chairman and chief executive, said demand for printing
papers had risen a few percentage points from last year. Increases in
reprographic and coated groundwood papers had been made for the third
quarter.

ALCAN ALUMINIUM, the Canadian aluminium group, faced with weaker ingot and
fabricated product prices, posted a second-quarter loss of USDollars 35m, or
18 cents a common share, against a loss of Dollars 29m, or 15 cents, a year
earlier.
Sales and operating revenues for the quarter were 5 per cent lower at
Dollars 1.86bn.
For the first six months, Alcan's loss deepened to Dollars 55m, or 29 cents
a share, compared with a deficit of Dollars 44m, or 24 cents, a year
earlier. First-half sales and operating revenues were Dollars 3.6bn, against
Dollars 3.8bn.
Second-quarter fabricated products volumes were stable but actual realised
prices were down 9 per cent. Ingot shipments were slightly higher but
realised prices were down 10 per cent.
The lower prices were partly offset by cost reductions and a weaker Canadian
dollar. Interest costs were also lower.
Total shipments of ingot and fabricated products in the second quarter were
641,000 tonnes, against 610,000 tonnes, and in the first half roughly the
same at 1.22m tonnes.
In Canada, where most of Alcan's primary production is located, losses were
higher in the second quarter while US operations posted a loss, compared
with a small profit in the 1992 period.
Latin America improved and posted a small profit. European results
deteriorated with the recession and the Pacific suffered a small loss,
reflecting poor results from the Japanese associate.
Alcan's results are the latest set of weak numbers to emerge from the
industry. Earlier this week Aluminum Company of America, the world's biggest
producer, reported a 21 per cent decline in second-quarter net income.
Inflated by imports from the former Soviet Union, world aluminium stocks are
high and prices weak.

FT  15 JUL 93 / International Company News: Dream seeks bankruptcy
protection
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DREAM, a Japanese civil engineering company turned pinball parlour operator
and stock speculator, has filed for bankruptcy protection with the Nagoya
District Court.
The failure of Dream, which has about Y50bn (Dollars 462m) in outstanding
debts, also raises doubts about the future of Gajeon Kanko, a stock
market-listed hotel operator, which admits that Dream pays its employees'
salaries. Trading in Gajeon Kanko stock was suspended yesterday.
Dream's filing highlights the extreme pressure on companies which thrived in
the easy money days of the late 1980s, but which are now facing huge losses
on stock and property investments. They are also finding funds difficult to
raise, as once-friendly banks are refusing to provide fresh loans.
Both companies are linked to the already collapsed Cosmopolitan speculators'
group, which bought stakes in dozens of companies during the 1980s,
including a range of regional banks, which were expected to fund its
investment activities.
Former Cosmopolitan executives boasted of gangster links, although the
claims could have been an attempt to lubricate the company's many attempts
at 'greenmail', forcing companies to buy off spurious takeover attempts.
Dream is still the largest shareholder in Gifu Bank, a conservative regional
bank based in central Japan. While Dream, which operates pachinko
(Japanese-style pinball) parlours, holds 5.5 per cent of the bank, it is
understood that most of the company's funds have come from independent
finance companies.
For the year ended March, 1993, Dream reported a pre-tax loss of Y2.3bn and
shortly after acquired 10m shares in Gajeon Kanko for Y2bn, which the
company now says was never paid. With the allocation of the shares, Dream
had acquired 21 per cent of Gajeon, making it the biggest shareholder.
The complex links among the many speculator groups in Japan have led to
Gajeon being caught up in the scandals surrounding Itoman, the large textile
trader taken over by the Sumitomo group this year following a string of
investments in stocks, property and French impressionist paintings.
Mr Tsutomu Kudo, Gajeon's president, yesterday said his company had no
collateral for the Y2bn in stocks given to Dream, nor is there a formal loan
contract between the two companies.
Apart from highlighting the influence of speculator groups, the Dream and
Gajeon sagas have also drawn attention to auditors in Japan.
Two years ago, an auditor approved, then rejected, and then approved
Gajeon's accounts, though little new information was provided.

CBS, which owns one of the three US television networks, posted unexpectedly
strong second-quarter earnings of Dollars 107.4m, or Dollars 6.73 a share.
The group predicted record earnings from continuing operations for the full
year.
A year earlier, CBS posted net earnings of Dollars 69m, or Dollars 4.46.
Earnings in the 1993 quarter included a one-time pre-tax gain of Dollars
14.2m. Sales grew to Dollars 835.8m from Dollars 779.9m.
On Wall Street, CBS shares closed at Dollars 245, a rise of Dollars 7 1/4 .
The improved earnings were attributed to better results from the company's
television network, benefiting from higher advertising sales, cost
containment and its leading position in the prime time market.
For the first half, CBS recorded net profits of Dollars 161.6m, or Dollars
10.23 a share, on sales of Dollars 1.71bn.
In the first six months of 1992, the group took charges for accounting
changes of Dollars 81.5m, which reduced net income to Dollars 5m, or 32
cents, on sales of Dollars 1.86bn.
Mr Laurence Tisch, chairman and chief executive, said the company's
television network saw sales grow by 8 per cent in the latest quarter.
He added that CBS expected to exceed significantly its record full-year
earnings from continuing operations of Dollars 11.54 a share, set in 1989.

FT  15 JUL 93 / International Company News: Charles Schwab ahead at Dollars
31.6m but growth slows

CHARLES Schwab, the largest discount brokerage house in the US, yesterday
reported a big increase in second-quarter profits to Dollars 31.6m, up from
the Dollars 18.5m earned in the same quarter of 1992.
Like other securities houses, however, Schwab's profits in the second
quarter were slightly lower than in the first period of the year, when the
firm earned a record Dollars 35.4m.
The downturn in earnings suggests that while Wall Street continues to
benefit from a two-year boom in stock market and underwriting activity, the
pace of growth has slackened over the past three months.
Yesterday, the San-Francisco based firm said that client trading activity in
June was the softest of any month this year.
Mr Charles Schwab, chairman, said he also expected retail trading activity
to weaken in the third quarter, although he believed the firm's results for
that period would still be an improvement on the same period of 1992, when
Schwab earned a below-average Dollars 7.8m.
Commission revenues rose 34 per cent to Dollars 136m, mutual fund service
fees by 53 per cent to Dollars 23.1m, and principal transactions revenues by
30 per cent to Dollars 39.3m.
Non-interest expenses rose 26 per cent to Dollars 180.4m, primarily due to
increased trading activity and an 8.5 per cent rise in client assets to a
record Dollars 79.2bn.
Shares in Schwab rose initially on the earnings announcement, but then fell
back from close to a year-high on profit-taking. By the end of trading the
stock was at Dollars 27 5/8, down Dollars 1 3/8.

FT  15 JUL 93 / International Company News: Genentech results show sharp
increase

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GENENTECH, the US bio-technology company 60 per cent owned by Roche of
Switzerland, lifted second-quarter net income to Dollars 10.4m from Dollars
3.4m a year earlier, driven by a jump in income from product sales and
licensing.
The increase in earnings per share to 9 cents, up from 3 cents a year
earlier (though below the 12 cents of the first quarter), helped to lift the
company's shares by Dollars  1/2 to close at Dollars 44 1/4 in New York.
Sales of Activase, the heart drug which is the company's biggest-selling
product, continued to recover from the decline which had largely accounted
for a slump in the company's 1992 earnings.
Following results at the end of April from a 40,000-patient trial, sales of
Activase rose to Dollars 55.8m in the quarter, up from Dollars 49.2m in the
first three months and Dollars 44.6m in the second quarter of 1992.
Overall, product sales increased to Dollars 110.8m (Dollars 95.8m in the
second quarter of 1992).
Contract income jumped from Dollars 5.3m to Dollars 24.3, due largely to an
Dollars 18.2m contribution from a three-year licence agreement with
Schering. Total revenues were up to Dollars 169.8m, from Dollars 153m in the
first quarter and Dollars 136m in the second three months of 1992.
The company's normally high research and development spending jumped
further, to Dollars 83.9m (Dollars 73.3m), as it took a charge of Dollars
13.7m to end an agreement involving the Research Institute of Molecular
Pathology in Vienna.
The R&amp;D effort yielded two significant developments in the quarter: the
start of development work on a new heart drug and a decision by the US Food
and Drug Administration to review Genentech's cystic fibrosis treatment.
On the former, Mr Kirk Raab, chairman, said: 'If this molecule performs as
well in the clinic as it does in the laboratory, it could advance the
treatment of heart attack even further than Activase has.'

SHARES in Federal Express jumped yesterday morning after the US's biggest
overnight delivery company unveiled a 56 per cent increase in fourth-quarter
profits, reflecting reduced international losses.
At the market's close, shares in the Memphis-based company were up Dollars 6
1/2 at Dollars 53 3/8 after a delayed opening following the earnings release
after Wall Street's close on Tuesday.
The company said it was talking to Lufthansa, the German airline, about
buying passenger aircraft to be converted to freighters in a deal that could
be worth about Dollars 400m.
For the three months to May 31, Fedex posted net income of Dollars 55.8m, or
Dollars 1.01 a share, compared with Dollars 35.8m, or 66 cents, a year
earlier. Revenues rose 8 per cent in the last quarter of fiscal 1993 to
Dollars 2.04bn from Dollars 1.89bn the previous year.
Operating income in the quarter rose 24 per cent to Dollars 136.5m from
Dollars 109.8m.
In the latest quarter, the international business showed some improvement.
Operating losses narrowed to Dollars 25.4m on revenues of Dollars 539.2m
from an operating deficit of Dollars 53.2m on revenues of Dollars 536.1m a
year ago.
Mr Alan Graf, chief financial officer, expects international operations to
break even by fiscal 1995 or earlier.
For the full year, Fedex had net income of Dollars 53.9m, or 98 cents,
compared with a loss of Dollars 113.8m, or Dollars 2.11, the previous year.
Results were distorted by one-time charges in both years, including the
adoption of new accounting standards in fiscal 1993 and a pre-tax Dollars
254m charge for restructuring.
Stripping out extraordinary items, the company earned Dollars 109.8m, or
Dollars 2.01, in fiscal 1993, against Dollars 54.7m, or Dollars 1.01, a year
earlier. Revenues rose to Dollars 7.81bn from Dollars 7.55bn.
In the US, the average price per package fell faster than costs,
contributing in a decline in domestic underlying operating income to Dollars
559.2m from Dollars 635.9m a year ago.

50.6m
</HEADLINE>

   By KAREN ZAGOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RUBBERMAID, the household plastic goods company, yesterday posted a 16 per
cent improvement in second-quarter net income on sales which rose 9 per
cent, reflecting the success of new products and aggressive marketing which
helped lift volume in the quarter.
For the three months to June 30, net income was Dollars 50.6m, or 32 cents a
share, on sales of Dollars 488.5m, against earnings of Dollars 43.7m, or 27
cents, on sales of Dollars 449.1m a year earlier.
Mr Wolfgang Schmitt, Rubbermaid's recently-appointed chief executive, said:
'We intend to deliver another record year in 1993. New product efforts have
been intensified with plans to exceed 1992's level of introducing, on
average, a new product every day of the year.
'With the momentum of these new products and some firming in the economy, we
would expect second-half sales comparisons to exceed those of the first
half,' he said.
Mr Schmitt added that the company continued to emphasise cost controls and
productivity improvement.
He was named chairman of Rubbermaid in November after the unexpected
resignation of Mr Walter Williams following an examination ordered by
outside directors of budget overruns in Rubbermaid's commercial products
division. Mr Williams is said to have resigned for personal reasons,
unconnected with the examination.
For the first six months, Rubbermaid had net income of Dollars 100.2m, or 63
cents, against Dollars 67.4m, or 41 cents, a year ago.

   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FINANCIERO Banamex-Accival, Mexico's largest financial group, reported an
equivalent of net earnings of 663m pesos (Dollars 211m) in the second
quarter, 8.9 per cent up from the same period in 1992.
However, earnings at Banamex, the group's bank, dropped by 18.7 per cent to
526m pesos, and at Accival, the brokerage, by 46.3 per cent to 37m pesos.
Banacci's earnings would have fallen by 11.4 per cent if a revaluation of
assets had been excluded.
Most Mexican financial groups exclude revaluation of assets from net
earnings. Banacci reported a revaluation of 29m pesos, compared with a large
deficit in the second quarter last year.
It said a significant portion of the surplus was due to an appreciation of
securities held by its subsidiaries, which if realised, would have been
reported as trading income.
The group blamed the sharp fall in Banacci's income on the slowdown in the
Mexican economy and the stringent monetary and credit policies of the
government.

FT  15 JUL 93 / International Company News: First Chicago net up at Dollars
160m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A RISE of 75 per cent in non-interest income at First Chicago, the
thirteenth-largest bank in the US last year ranked by assets, pushed net
income up to Dollars 169m, or Dollars 1.81 a share, from Dollars 35m, or 32
cents, a year earlier.
Increased income from trading in financial markets and a further strong
performance by the bank's venture capital investments largely accounted for
the rise.
Profits from trading short-term interest rate and bond derivatives, and from
trading in emerging markets, lifted dealing profits to Dollars 92m.
Meanwhile, venture capital holdings turned in earnings of Dollars 57m, or 67
cents, against a Dollars 21m loss a year earlier.
Non-interest income was also boosted by a rise in credit-card fees during
the quarter to Dollars 164.2m from Dollars 116.6m in the same period in
1992. Total non-interest income leapt to Dollars 540m from Dollars 288m.
Net interest income edged ahead to Dollars 303m from Dollars 290m as First
Chicago continued to shrink its loan assets. These fell to Dollars 22bn from
Dollars 25bn, resulting from securitisation of Dollars 1bn of credit-card
receivables and a continuation of the move away from lending to large
companies.
Lending to small and medium-sized companies in and around Chicago remained
steady. Loan demand from this sector had begun to strengthen, though the
bank had not relaxed its credit policies, said Mr John Ballantine, chief
credit officer.
The work-out of troubled real-estate loans continued, with the disposal of
nearly Dollars 200m of assets to leave a portfolio of Dollars 402m.
The gains during the quarter pushed the bank's return on capital to 21 per
cent, and enabled it to raise key tier one capital ratio to a comfortable 8
per cent, from 6 per cent as recently as last September.

FT  15 JUL 93 / International Company News: Marion Merrell Dow restructures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MARION Merrell Dow, the pharmaceuticals group 70 per cent owned by Dow, the
large US chemicals company, yesterday announced a sweeping package of
measures to reduce costs by about Dollars 250m a year.
The restructuring, including a 13 per cent cut in staff, rationalisation of
research and development, and other cost-cutting measures, will lead to a
special pre-tax charge of about Dollars 180m. Most of the Dollars 250m
savings should be achieved this year.
Mr Fred Lyons, MMD president, said: 'We are moving aggressively to realign
our business, both to improve current results in face of rapidly changing
conditions and to prepare for the longer-term opportunities.'
The measures were principally in response to the growing importance of the
'managed' (bulk discount) care sector in the US, Mr Lyons said. MMD is a
leader in managed care, from which it generates about 40 per cent of its US
sales.
The rationalisation is also a response to a series of blows in recent
months. Sales of Nicoderm, the best-selling smoking patch in the US,
collapsed this year as the smoking cessation market, worth Dollars 800m in
1992, fell to Dollars 350m.
MMD has also been affected by the expiry last November of the US patents of
its best-selling product, the heart drug Cardizem, which had sales last year
of more than Dollars 1bn. Sales of Seldane, its anti-histamine, have been
undermined by safety concerns. Business in Europe has also been affected by
healthcare reforms in Germany and Italy.
The company plans to cut as many as 1,300 jobs from its workforce of 9,800.
Most of the reduction will be in the US. The figure includes cutting 275
full-time US sales representatives and 200 part-time sales positions.
MMD saw first-quarter turnover fall 21 per cent to Dollars 617m from Dollars
779m and pre-tax profits decline 56 per cent to Dollars 74m.
It said it would focus its R&amp;D on specific projects, including a Seldane
metabolite that would not have the side effects now associated with the
product; Sabril, an anti-epileptic; and allergy products.
Last year, MMD formed a joint venture with SmithKline Beecham, the
Anglo-American healthcare group, to develop and market over-the-counter
medicines in the US.

SHELL Canada has strengthened its natural gas reserves in the Sable Island
area off Nova Scotia in a property exchange with Petro-Canada, writes Robert
Gibbens in Montreal.
Petrocan has acquired Shell's 5.3 per cent stake in the Terra Nova oilfield
off Newfoundland, increasing its interest to 49 per cent.
In exchange, Petrocan has transferred part of its minority interests in six
gasfields in the Sable Island area to Shell. This means Shell now has a 25
per cent share of 3,700bn cubic feet of gas reserves about 175 miles east of
Halifax.
Most of the gas reserves were found in the mid-1970s in an exploration
programme led by Shell. However, Shell and partners have no plans yet to
develop the gas.

ALLIEDSIGNAL, the US aerospace and automotive group, is to buy the Data
Control unit from Sundstrand of the US, for Dollars 195m. The deal is
expected to close in September, Reuter reports.
The business, with 1992 sales of Dollars 194m, makes avionics products for
data management, ground hazard avoidance, general aviation communications,
navigation and instrumentation.
Allied said the deal would contribute to 1994 earnings, but did not
elaborate.
Separately, Sundstrand which makes aerospace components, said its
second-quarter earnings, to be released this week, would be up from the
second quarter of 1992 but the company was 'disappointed with the overall
level of our earnings momentum.'
It added that the sale of its Data Control business to AlliedSignal for
Dollars 195m would result in a significant, non-recurring financial gain.

VARITY, the the Buffalo-based industrial group, has won a long-term
contract, valued at more than Dollars 135m annually, to supply anti-lock
braking systems to Volkswagen in Germany, Reuter reports.
Varity's Kelsey-Hayes will supply its latest EBC 10 line of braking systems
to Volkswagen beginning in 1996, for use in the 1997 model year.
This is the third large European contract for the system won by Kelsey-Hayes
since it introduced its products overseas in 1991, the company said.
It predicted that Europe's anti-lock braking systems market would grow to 60
per cent of all vehicles manufactured there in 1997, compared with 25 per
cent today.

FT  15 JUL 93 / International Company News: Gencor unit in R1.25bn share
swap

GENBEL, the investment arm of Gencor, South Africa's second largest mining
house, has announced two large share swap transactions, valued at R1.25bn
(Dollars 372m), which will expedite the unbundling of the Gencor group.
In a tidying-up exercise preceding the planned unbundling, Genbel has
exchanged its foreign interests as well as a portfolio of mining shares for
shares in Engen, Sappi and Beatrix, three other companies in the Gencor
stable. The portfolio is valued at R862m.
In a second share exchange with Sankorp, Gencor's ultimate controlling
company, Genbel has exchanged R385m worth of Sappi and Engen shares for R50m
in cash plus shares in ABSA, Murray and Roberts, Malbak and Mercedes
Information Technology.
From a Gencor perspective, the deal achieves two main aims: it means they
will have fewer Engen and Sappi shares to distribute when the unbundling is
effected, and it also consolidates their control of various mining
companies, notably Kinross, Impala, Samancor, Trans-Natal and Winkelhaak.
Getting access to offshore assets will also assist Gencor if it makes a bid
for Billiton, the mining arm of the Royal Dutch Shell group with which it is
currently in discussion.
Genbel's offshore interests (valued at R512m) consisted of shares in
TransAtlantic Holdings, cash and minor exploration ventures in Turkey. These
interests, plus R350m worth of shares in the five mining companies, have
been exchanged for 8.9m Engen shares, 12.4m Sappi shares and 5.1m Beatrix
shares.

FT  15 JUL 93 / International Company News: Dell stock hit by gloomy
second-quarter forecast
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
DELL Computer's share price fell sharply yesterday when the US personal
computer manufacturer said it expected to report a loss for its second
fiscal quarter after significant writedowns and restructuring charges.
Dell said losses would be between Dollars 1.65 and Dollars 1.85 a share and
it expected to record between Dollars 75m and Dollars 85m in pre-tax charges
for the quarter, which ends August 1. The company added that the projected
loss may place the company in default of the terms of its credit facilities.
Dell has been a long-time favourite among Wall Street investors. It has
grown rapidly to become the fifth-largest PC company in the world by
pioneering direct marketing of PCs through mail and telephone sales.
Its sales tripled over the past two years to Dollars 2bn in fiscal 1992.
In early trading, Dell's share price dropped to Dollars 13 7/8 , a 2 1/2
 year low. It regained some of its losses to trade at Dollars 15 7/8 at the
close, down Dollars 3 3/8 from Tuesday's close and 68 per cent below its
high of Dollars 49 7/8 reached in January.
Dell said it expected to report revenues of between Dollars 710m and Dollars
730m for the second quarter, up by between 55 per cent and 60 per cent from
the same period last year. Total revenues for fiscal 1993 would be about
Dollars 3bn, it added.
Dell's fast growth was at the root of its problems. Management controls had
not kept pace with the rapid expansion of sales, the company said. However,
analysts added that it faced credibility problems.
In May, Dell reported a sharp drop in first-quarter earnings, which it
blamed on delays and cancellation of notebook computer products. At the
time, analysts expressed concern that Dell's problems appeared to go beyond
notebook computers. Yesterday, their fears were confirmed.
Dell said that in addition to costs associated with delayed and cancelled
notebook products, it would take restructuring charges.
The group said it expected to resume its earnings growth by the fourth
quarter of the fiscal year.
'While the loss is certainly disappointing, we are determined to take the
steps necessary to strengthen Dell for the future,' said Mr Michael Dell,
chairman and chief executive.
Dell said it was working with its lenders to revise the terms of its credit
facilities. 'I am confident that we will be able to secure alternative
financing or obtain a waiver,' said Mr Thomas Meredith, chief financial
officer.

THYSSEN Industrie, the capital goods division of Thyssen, hopes to bring all

Mr Rohkamm said that if all divisions were able to remain profitable under
difficult economic conditions, the company would be able to lift its sales
to earnings ratio.
He declined to say which companies would post a loss in the current year but
said automotive supply and engineering were hit hardest by the slump in car
and steel industries.
Orders on hand were about DM9bn (Dollars 5.6bn) but group incoming orders
would be down 10 per cent from DM8.4bn a year earlier.

strong demand

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BANESTO, the Spanish commercial bank, yesterday claimed strong demand for
its 3-for-1 rights issue, designed to improve the institution's weak capital
base by raising some Pta52.6bn (Dollars 395m).
Mr Mario Conde, chairman, said 25 per cent of the rights had been subscribed
within the first five days of trading. The issue is the first stage of a
three-part plan to increase the bank's capital, and the response means JP
Morgan's Dollars 1bn Corsair fund, which has committed Dollars 200m to
Banesto, may reserve its investment for the second tranche.
In the second stage, Banesto will place 22.2m shares with investors,
including the US institutions grouped in the Corsair fund and Mr Conde.
Banesto shares are trading at slightly over Pta2,000 each. The new shares in
the rights issue are priced at Pta1,500 and the shares in the placement at
Pta1,900.
Mr Conde said fee commissions had realised Pta10.5bn in the second quarter
of 1993, up 11.5 per cent on the first quarter and 21 per cent on the last
quarter of 1992.
Average monthly borrowing on the interbank market had been reduced from
Pta587.9bn in May to Pta236.6bn last month, Mr Conde said. Bad debts
totalled Pta213.7bn in the second quarter, against Pta219.5bn in the first
quarter, and provisions now cover 56 per cent of bad debts against 46.5 per
cent at end-1992.
He said Pta18.3bn had been set aside for bad debts in the second quarter
following a Pta10.7bn allocation in the first three months. Total provisions
in the first six months of this year are already up on last year's total of
Pta24.7bn.
The third tranche of the capital raising effort will be a Dollars 400m
convertible bond with a coupon of between 6 per cent and 7 per cent. A final
decision on the timing will be taken after subscription of the rights issue
and the share placement ends in the first week of August.

FT  15 JUL 93 / International Company News: Efim defence transfer agreed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE reorganisation of the companies in Italy's troubled defence sector was
brought a step closer yesterday.
The government has allowed the defence companies in the portfolio of Efim,
the state industrial holding placed in liquidation a year ago, to be taken
over without payment by Finmeccanica, the main industrial and
high-technology arm of IRI, the state holding company.
Efim possesses seven main defence groups employing 11,400 people with
turnover of L2,269bn (Dollars 1.4bn).
The principal problem has been to find a formula which guaranteed the
survival of these companies, at least those with recognised leadership in
technology, and keep sufficient control within Italian hands. Since January,
Finmeccanica has been managing the Efim defence interests on a temporary
six-month contract.
Finmeccanica stated that it was only willing to take over the Efim defence
companies if their balance sheets were thoroughly examined and the
government agreed to outline a clear programme of defence needs and
procurement plans.
Only on this basis, Finmeccanica argued, could the companies be absorbed and
rationalised, fitting into its own defence interests grouped around Alenia,
the aerospace group.
Otherwise, Finmeccanica said it could only undertake to run the companies as
an operator without financial responsibility - at least so long as they were
loss-making.
The government failed to come up with a defence procurement programme by
June 30, and a decision was delayed for a further 15 days.
Yesterday's move appeared a hurried attempt to put in place the outlines for
what will be a more timely process of guaranteeing work in the defence
procurement programme.
In a separate development, representatives of foreign banks, owed L4,400bn
as a result of Efim being put into liquidation and payments being frozen,
yesterday met Treasury officials in Rome.
They are understood to have pressed the Treasury to urge Brussels to lift
its veto, imposed more than three months ago, on about L7,000bn of funds
earmarked by the Italian government for Efim creditors and suppliers.
Of the L9,000bn so far agreed by the government to fund the liquidation and
cover outstanding Efim debts, only L2,000bn has been given the green light
by Brussels.

FT  15 JUL 93 / International Company News: Bavaria plans large share
sell-off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bavarian government hopes to raise between DM2bn and DM3bn (Dollars
1.25bn-Dollars 1.9bn) through the privatisation of its shareholdings in
several German companies, Mr Edmund Stoiber, the state premier, said
yesterday.
Its biggest stake is a 58 per cent holding in Bayernwerk, the largest
southern German energy utility, which would be merged with Viag, the
Bonn-based industrial conglomerate.
Negotiations with Viag are under way, and Mr Stoiber said he confidently
expected the new company to move its headquarters to Munich as part of the
deal.
'I believe they are ready to move and create a big new undertaking with its
headquarters in Munich,' he said.
At the same time, the Bavarian government is planning an early sale of its 8
per cent stake in Deutsche Aerospace (Dasa), the Daimler-Benz aerospace
subsidiary, for an estimated DM400m.
The proposed sell-offs mark the first significant move among the German
Lander to break supportive links forged during the post-war economic
recovery with vital infrastructural and new, job-creating industries.
The federal government is committed to cashing in most of its remaining
holdings, including a 51 per cent stake in the Lufthansa airline, which is
being restructured and restored to profit.
Recent interest in privatisation has been spurred primarily by the urgent
need, stressed by the Bundesbank, for the reduction of federal and state
deficits.
Central bank officials have lately suggested that the budget consolidation
process could be helped by sell-offs.
Activity has been encouraged by statements from national leaders of the
Social Democratic party (SPD) that there are no longer any ideological
objections to the sale of public assets. However, acceptance at Land level,
where the SPD controls most of the regional governments in western Germany,
has yet to be tested.
There is a growing acceptance among public sector shareholders that the
attractions of Germany to foreign shareholders could be enhanced if all
traces of political involvement in private sector business were removed.
Many of Germany's leading companies have regional politicians on their
supervisory boards by virtue of extensive state holdings.
The Lower Saxony government, for example, owns 20 per cent of Volkswagen,
Europe's biggest volume car maker. North Rhine Westphalia controls the
Westdeutsche Landesbank, which in turn has significant stakes in local and
international businesses.
Bavaria's decision to offload the holding in Dasa is likely to enhance the
attractions of Daimler-Benz shares when they are listed on the New York
Stock Exchange later this year.
The state's withdrawal from Bayernwerk in a phased process (its 58 per cent
holding will be reduced to 50.1 per cent in the first stage) would suit the
ambitions of Viag to consolidate its position and expand further in the
highly profitable power business.
Viag owns 39 per cent of the utility, which, in turn, has a 24.9 per cent
stake in the conglomerate.
Viag is known to have been pressing for a restructuring. The conditions for
absorbing Bayernwerk into a privately-controlled concern were better than
before, Mr Alfred Pfeiffer, Viag chairman, told shareholders yesterday.
Mr Georg von Waldenfels, the Bavarian finance minister, said the government
might retain a stake of up to 40 per cent in the new business, a complete
withdrawal was being considered in the medium term.
Mr Stoiber, who took over as Bavarian premier only last month, said that the
privatisation process was not intended to finance the Bavarian state budget,
but rather to provide long-term investment funds to attract and promote more
high-technology investment in the state.
Apart from Bayernwerk and Dasa, Bavaria has a stake in Rhein-Main-Donau, the
company operating the canal linking Germany's two main rivers with the
Danube, and in Bayerische Wasserkraftwerke, a hydroelectric generating
business.
Mr von Waldenfels said the government aimed for a quick sale of both
holdings. However, there were no plans to withdraw from the Bayerische
Vereinsbank, one of the top five banks in the country, and traditional links
with the Hofbrauhaus brewery would remain, Mr von Waldenfels said.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
North Housing Association achieved a surplus of Pounds 13.7m from turnover
of Pounds 41.5m in the year to end-March, despite the continuing decline in
'right to buy' sales, which contributed Pounds 900,000 less than last year.
The outcome compared with a surplus of Pounds 12.2m from turnover of Pounds
37.3m last year.
Directors said the total surplus would be reinvested for the benefit of
people in housing need. The association intends to start building 1,750 new
homes in the current year, for which the expected total expenditure is
Pounds 76m.

FT  15 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Johnson Matthey sees improvement
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There were 'signs of improvement' is some of the most important markets
served by Johnson Matthey, the world's biggest platinum group metals
marketing group, reported Mr David Davies, chairman, at the annual meeting.
In particular, recovery in the US had benefited North American sales by the
catalytic systems and materials technology divisions.
The recent improvement in platinum, palladium and gold prices had largely
offset a further fall in the price of rhodium, Mr Davies pointed out.
He reported that more than 90 per cent of shareholders had accepted an
enhanced scrip alternative to the final dividend which would save the group
Pounds 3.8m of advance corporation tax and also benefit shareholders.

<TEXT>
NOBO Group, a manufacturer of office and business products, returned profits
of Pounds 1.65m pre-tax for the year to end-April, an improvement of 49 per
cent over last time's Pounds 1.11m.
The figure was helped by a Pounds 187,000 reduction in interest charges to
Pounds 476,000.
Turnover was static at Pounds 21.1m - Nobo disposed of its office furniture
business in October last year. Turnover of the core business of visual aids
and desk top accessories increased by 6 per cent.
A proposed final dividend of 3.3p makes a 4.8p (3.5p) total. Earnings
improved from 6.34p to 10.41p per share.
Year-end gearing was cut to 32 per cent (60 per cent) helped by cash flow
from the disposal and the placing of 526,660 new shares in March.

FT  15 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Tapping institutional investors - Has the
nursing home sector saturated the market?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE POOR performance of Court Cavendish's shares in their first two days of
trading as a quoted company has raised questions for investors who have
chosen the nursing home sub-sector as a growth area.
Court Cavendish was floated at 225p a share, valuing the company at Pounds
51m. Its issue involved raising Pounds 40m through the sale of 17.7m new
shares, as well as existing shareholders selling 2.56m shares.
Although the public offer was 2.2 times subscribed and allocations were
scaled down, the shares had fallen to 198p by last night's close, 27p below
the issue price.
Last week another nursing home group, CrestaCare, raised Pounds 33.3m
through a placing, doubling its market value. There is also persistent
speculation that Takare, the market leader, will return to the market for
new equity in September - speculation described by Mr Hamilton Anstead,
deputy managing director, as idle and irresponsible.
So has the healthy appetite for nursing home shares suddenly faded?
CrestaCare's advisers say they found no difficulty in finding buyers for the
company's new shares, even after a placing of over 20 per cent of the
group's equity as recently as March.
One excuse put forward for Court Cavendish's dismal initial showing was that
the CrestaCare placing - which came between the closing of Court Cavendish's
offer and its first dealings - sated institutional investors desire for
stock.
When stags tried to sell their shares they found no institutional demand,
and the weight of selling pushed Court Cavendish's price down.
But one institutional investor gave another reason. He believes that Court
Cavendish, placed fifth in the market behind the likes of Takare and
Westminster Health Care, was overpriced given its record - or even that it
should not have floated at all.
He points to its record of losses since formation four years ago and a
refinancing two years ago. In effect, he says, the flotation was another
refinancing exercise. Court Cavendish is using the money to repay debt of
Pounds 24.6m and to fund further expansion.
Others say that Court Cavendish's policy of buying nursing homes, many
converted from old, large houses with extra accommodation added, compared
badly with the policy of the market leaders of building their own homes to
particular specifications.
Another consideration is that the industry has been affected by the changes
to the government's funding of nursing home care on April 1, which has
slightly depressed occupancy rates and put some pressure on pricing.
However, most accept that this is a short term effect, and in the longer
term the reforms should increase private sector provision of nursing homes.
The wider question, though, is how long this young but fast-growing industry
will need to suck in new equity capital to expand.
Once established with a high occupancy rate, nursing homes are highly cash
generative. But even so the rapid expansion rates of many companies, which
can see demand for beds fast outstripping supply, means relatively young
companies cannot finance their expansion internally.
Takare, which joined the Official List in 1989, has raised Pounds 67.2m
through three equity issues, and another Pounds 50m through a 20-year
debenture secured on some of its homes.
At the time of its last placing in September 1991, which raised Pounds
35.4m, Takare promised not to issue more equity for two years, hence the
speculation that it will come to the market this autumn.
But Mr Anstead says Takare has sufficient bank facilities never to come to
the equity market again, although conceding this would take its gearing to
100 per cent at some future date before rising cash flow brought debt down
once more. He says the company is not ruling out an equity issue but will
not make one if there is not the appetite for it.
Mr Kent Phippen, finance director of Westminster Health Care, which floated
in April with an issue raising Pounds 63m, says that there are early signs
of a leasing market for nursing homes developing in the UK. Such a market
operates well in the US, but may take a couple of years before opening here.
He believes that with many homes operated under long-term contract to health
authorities, the guaranteed revenue stream should entice institutions more
used to investing in office blocks.
All in all, there is still confidence that Court Cavendish's experience of
apparently poor institutional demand for its shares should not put a damper
on the industry as a whole.

FT  15 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Stanley Leisure at Pounds 8m despite
Aintree debacle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AINTREE'S Grand Debacle failed to prevent Stanley Leisure Organisation, the
betting shop, casino and snooker club group, lifting pre-tax profits from
Pounds 7.82m to Pounds 8.05m in the year to May 2.
Stanley would normally net up to Pounds 300,000 from the Grand National. But
offsetting the loss of the Aintree profit, it benefited from evening racing
during the period. It would press, however, for a more 'betting
shop-friendly' racing schedule.
Stanley did not adopt FRS 3. Mr Paul Olive, financial director, said the
standard would not have altered the year's results. The previous period
covered 53 weeks.
Mr Leonard Steinberg, chairman, said 'turnover has gone up and we feel that
the company and the industry generally has come out of recession.' Turnover
improved from Pounds 203.3m to Pounds 218.4m.
The company increased the number of its betting shops to 326 (314) at the
year-end. The total currently stands at 355. The division contributed Pounds
189.6m (Pounds 174.3m) to turnover. The average stake per slip increased to
Pounds 3.45 (Pounds 3.38); however pre-tax profits fell to Pounds 5.76m
(Pounds 6.22m).
The acquisition in February of the Surrey Group of betting shops in Scotland
for Pounds 2.99m contributed 2 per cent of total turnover and Pounds 50,000
to pre-tax profits.
The casino division, which accounts for about half of group turnover, now
has 18 (17) outlets and contributed Pounds 6.73m (Pounds 5.94m) to pre-tax
profits on increased sales, thanks mainly to cost control.
The snooker division made a small profit masked by its inclusion with
central costs.
Gearing rose to 36.8 per cent (35.3 per cent) on net debt of Pounds 34.2m
(Pounds 29.5m). Net asset value per share rose to 210p, up 10 per cent on
last year, in part as a result of a Pounds 5.34m surplus on property
revaluation.
A proposed final dividend of 2.8p makes a 4.32p (4.16p adjusted) total.
Earnings per share rose to 12.78p (12.32p restated).

FT  15 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Venture offshoot helps BWD to Pounds 1.81m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BWD SECURITIES, the USM-quoted stockbroking and financial services group,
reported a 48 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds 1.81m for the six
months to May 31.
The outcome also represented an increase of nearly 4 per cent on profits of
Pounds 1.74m recorded in the last full year.
Turnover rose 34 per cent to Pounds 7.43m (Pounds 5.53m), partly reflecting
steady increases in new clients nationwide for BWD Rensburg, its
stockbroking arm, and expansion of Northern Registrars, the wholly owned
share registry subsidiary.
Profits were helped by 'significant uplift' at Capital for Companies, the
Leeds-based venture offshoot, which raised Pounds 39m for assured tenancy
schemes under the Business Expansion Scheme. Although the government is
shutting down the BES in December, the schemes will yield annual fee income
for five years.
The interim dividend is 1.5p (1.3p), payable from earnings per share of 6.6p
(4.5p).
The group is placing 841,885 new shares at 95 1/2 p each via James Capel,
its broker, to fund the purchase of a 10,000 sq ft modern office block near
its headquarters for Northern Registrars. The subsidiary now acts as
registrar for about 70 companies and continuing expansion has seen it
outgrow its existing offices.
The new shares will rank pari passu with the 18.03m existing shares but will
not qualify for the interim dividend.

FT  15 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Widney to buy SPC for Pounds 4m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WIDNEY, a maker of windows and water treatment, power transmission and
electronic equipment, has entered into a conditional agreement to acquire
SPC International for a maximum Pounds 4m.
The company's shares were suspended at 7p last month pending the
announcement of an acquisition. Dealings were restored yesterday and the
shares closed at 8p.
The principal activity of SPC, which was formed in 1989, is the purchase,
refurbishment and resale of electronic point of sale systems, cash
dispensing equipment and financial terminals for use in banks and shops
worldwide.
The initial consideration of Pounds 3.2m will be satisfied via the allotment
of 42.67m new shares, of which 23.47m are being placed on behalf of the
vendors at 7 1/2 p to raise some Pounds 1.76m.
Deferred consideration of up to Pounds 800,000 is dependent on profits.
Widney intends to raise a further Pounds 2.73m by the issue of an additional
36.41m new shares at 7 1/2 p to improve working capital and to cover the
costs of the purchase.
Accordingly, a total of 79.08m new shares will be issued of which 19.2m,
representing 14 per cent of the enlarged capital, will be retained by the
vendors.
The vendors of SPC have undertaken that profits before tax for the year
ended June will be not less than Pounds 600,000 (Pounds 487,000) and that
net assets at completion will be not less than Pounds 1.25m.

months

Interim pre-tax profits of Leslie Wise, the textile company which supplies
retail groups such as Burton and Etam, slipped from Pounds 1.51m to Pounds
1.23m.
Turnover for the six months to May 31 was virtually static at Pounds 22.6m
(Pounds 22.8m). Margins were under pressure in the core garment business due
to lower volumes and rising raw material costs.
Directors pointed out that trading throughout the group had improved towards
the end of the opening six months and that this trend had been maintained so
far in the second half.
Earnings emerged at 2.38p (2.96p) and the interim dividend is unchanged at
1.75p.

FT  15 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Growing thirst for cider lifts Bulmer to
Pounds 19.6m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CONTINUED growth of cider market in the UK, Australia and Belgium helped
HP Bulmer to a 15 per cent increase to Pounds 19.6m in pre-tax profits for
the 53 weeks to April 30.
The increase from Pounds 17.1m was achieved on sales ahead 13 per cent to
Pounds 251.8m (Pounds 221.9m), including Pounds 6.84m from Cidrerie Stassen,
the Belgian branded cider maker acquired in September. Sales were
underpinned in the UK by volume gains achieved by Bulmer's leading brands,
Strongbow, Woodpecker and Scrumpy Jack.
Earnings per share improved 15 per cent to 22.89p (19.96p); a proposed final
dividend of 6.4p (5.55p) makes a total for the year of 10.15p (9p). The
shares gained 13p to close at 419p.
Mr John Rudgard, chief executive, said the UK cider market had 'continued to
grow in all sectors,' including the private label business for supermarket
chains which expanded by 28 per cent last year.
In the UK Strongbow continued to dominate the mainstream cider market,
capturing 28.3 per cent of the on-trade business and adding 5,400 new taps.
Strongbow draught volumes grew by 17 per cent last year while in the premium
sector Scrumpy Jack volumes jumped 54 per cent.
The Australian operations achieved 10.8 per cent volume growth and a 34 per
cent increase in operating profits to Pounds 2.37m on sales of Pounds 14.4m.
In Belgium, Stassen achieved a 30 per cent volume growth in the 8 months to
the end of April and contributed Pounds 771,000 to total group operating
profits of Pounds 24.1m (Pounds 20.5m).
In soft drinks, both Kiri and Orangina achieved volume gains while Volvic,
the second largest mineral water brand after Evian, managed to increase
volumes by 25 per cent to 34.6m litres. However, the beer portfolio had 'a
difficult year' because of depressed demand with sales of Red Stripe down
slightly.
The pectin operations also suffered from reduced demand and fierce price
competition and operating profits fell by 61 per cent to Pounds 972,000
(Pounds 2.5m) on turnover of Pounds 12.5m (Pounds 14.5m). Mr Rudgard said a
strategic review of the business was nearing completion.
COMMENT
Bulmer's great strength is the depth of its brand portfolio across all the
market segments built through hefty marketing and solid investment
expenditure. The loss next year of the Perrier and Buxton distribution
contract - representing 14 per cent of secondary distribution tonnes -
should be covered within a year by volume growth in the rest of the product
portfolio. UK operating margins, although increasing, are still held back by
the lower margin beer and soft drinks operations, but would benefit from the
disposal or closure of the pectin business. This year pre-tax profits should
reach Pounds 21m, equivalent to earnings of 24.7p and producing a
prospective p/e of just under 17. Investors have a choice in how to play the
rapidly growing cider market: for certainty, they can chose Bulmer's
established depth of brands and management; for a bit of excitement, they
can pick up and coming Taunton Cider's ability to capture share with new
brands.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Crest Nicholson, the Surrey-based housebuilder, yesterday received an
adverse judgment in the High Court arising from its decision to rescind a
contract to purchase development land at Ford's Farm, Calcot, near Reading,
in 1988.
The court held that Crest had wrongfully refused to complete the purchase of
the land and awarded damages and interest amounting to Pounds 1.7m against
Crest, which was also ordered to pay three quarters of the plaintiff's
costs.
Crest said the loss arising from the judgment, which is expected to amount
to about Pounds 2m, would be charged as an exceptional item in the accounts
for the year to October 31.
Crest shares closed 3p lower at 59p.

FT  15 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Games side boost for Prism
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A STRONG performance from its computer games division helped Prism Leisure
report record profits for the 12 months to March 28.
Shares of the USM-quoted group rose 10p to 150p after the announcement of
pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.33m, up 37 per cent on the comparable Pounds
975,000. Turnover improved to Pounds 15.5m (Pounds 13.5m).
Mr Geoff Young, chairman, said the computer games side had exceeded
expectations: 'The customer profile has continued to improve and now covers
many major retailers,' he said.
The audio and video operation maintained profits in difficult trading, but
the German subsidiary, which began trading last July, produced an
'encouraging' profit, Mr Young said.
Cash balances at the year-end amounted to Pounds 1.5m.
A proposed final dividend of 2.37p brings the total to 3.27p - a 20 per cent
rise - covered over three times by earnings of 10.4p (8.4p) per share.

FT  15 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Rooney's future remains unclear
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FUTURE of Mr Bill Rooney as chairman and chief executive of Spring Ram,
the bathrooms and kitchens group, was still unclear last night. The shares
closed 4p lower at 51p.
After three profit warnings within eight months, Mr Rooney is under pressure
from institutional shareholders to resign. This move is led by the
Prudential Corporation, which speaks for 35 per cent of the group's equity.
After a meeting yesterday, the company said: 'The board of Spring Ram, which
remains united in its support for Mr Bill Rooney, recognises and accepts the
need for immediate and major changes in the structure, style and management
of the company for the 1990s. Today's meeting has been adjourned to enable
the board to seek further advice on the implementation of these changes.'
Neither Mr Rooney or any of the other directors would expand on the
statement, which raises several questions. It is not clear how compatible
'major changes' are with continuing support for Mr Rooney, a co-founder of
the company and still its dominating force.
Mr Rooney has said he would be prepared to give up the role of chairman or
chief executive, but not both. Mr Rooney and his family trusts have a 16 per
cent stake in the company.
Pre-tax profits in the first half of the current year were forecast to be
well below the comparable period, contrary to earlier expectations. In March
the company disclosed a pre-tax loss of Pounds 26m - a third less than
expected.

FT  15 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Storehouse chief lashes out - Shareholders
quiz chairman over departure of chief executive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR IAN Hay Davison, chairman of Storehouse, the retail group comprising BHS
and Mothercare, strongly criticised the decision by Mr David Dworkin, former
chief executive, to resign only six months after taking up the position.
Mr Hay Davison's attack on his former colleague, made in response to
repeated questions from shareholders at the company's annual meeting about
Mr Dworkin's resignation and pay, was unusually outspoken for a company
chairman.
He said his reaction to Mr Dworkin's departure from the group only weeks
after receiving a performance-related bonus of Pounds 2.71m was one of
'fury'. He added that he felt Mr Dworkin had let the company down.
'Maybe because he's an American and comes from a different cultural context
he did not understand that in this country you just don't leave a position
of chief executive of a company so soon after taking it up,' he said.
Mr Dworkin was promoted from chief executive of BHS to chief executive of
the Storehouse group in July 1992, but resigned in February to head US
stores group Carter Hawley Hale. His basic pay rose last year from Pounds
344,000 to Pounds 575,000 but a long-term performance bonus of Pounds 2.71m
 -negotiated when he first arrived at BHS in 1991 - took his total
remuneration for the year to Pounds 3.29m.
Mr Hay Davison is thought to be more angry about Mr Dworkin's decision to
leave after only six months in the chief executive's job than about the
bonus payment. He reminded shareholders yesterday that Mr Dworkin had
achieved dramatic results at Storehouse and that the group's market
capitalisation had increased by Pounds 400m since the beginning of 1992.
No money was paid to Mr Dworkin in compensation for loss of office. But Mr
Hay Davison told shareholders that, as a result of its recent experience,
Storehouse had reduced the length of executives' employment contracts to a
maximum of two years. Mr Hay Davison told the meeting that Storehouse's
sales were currently 5 per cent ahead of last year. The company avoided
giving a figure when it reported its full-year results in May, saying only
that sales were in line with targets.
However, he warned that Storehouse, like other retailers, had experienced a
general slow-down in trading since earlier in the year, and that its
year-on-year growth in sales came from its success in increasing market
share. It saw 'little if any increase in overall demand'.

FT  15 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Ex-Savoy man turns down Forte job offer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN ATTEMPT by the Forte hotel group to recruit Mr Willi Bauer, former
general manager of the Savoy, to run its luxury establishments has failed.
Forte said yesterday that Mr Bauer, chief executive of Wentworth golf and
country club group, had decided not to take the job for personal reasons.
Mr Bauer would have run Forte's Exclusive hotel portfolio, which includes
the Hyde Park and Grosvenor House in London, the George V in Paris, the Ritz
in Madrid and the Bristol in Warsaw. Mr Rocco Forte, Forte chairman, has
said he would like to merge the hotels with those run by the Savoy group.
Forte acquired the majority of Savoy shares following a bitter takeover
battle in the 1980s, but has a minority of voting shares. During the bid, Mr
Forte strongly criticised Mr Bauer's management skills. Savoy and Forte
agreed a five-year truce which ends in November next year.
Mr Bauer said last night of the proposed Forte position: 'It was and is the
most exciting job in the industry. But it would have meant an awful lot of
travelling and responsibilities worldwide. A job like that takes 100 per
cent commitment and I wouldn't want to travel 60 to 70 per cent of the
time.'

FT  15 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Scantronic shows advance to Pounds 3.09m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STRONG EUROPEAN markets helped Scantronic Holdings, the security components
supplier and manufacturer, lift pre-tax profits from Pounds 2.54m to Pounds
3.09m in the year to March 31.
Mr Ray Dias, finance director, said the company did not adopt FRS 3 ti
wanted to report separately exceptional and extraordinary provisions
relating to litigation.
The group took a Pounds 444,000 exceptional charge for doubtful trading debt
due from Alarm Parts and a Pounds 1.5m extraordinary cahrge mainly against
costs relating to the damages claim against the former owner of Arrowhead, a
US acquisition.
Turnover rose to Pounds 39.1m (Pounds 36.1m). Mr Wallace Clapperton,
chairman, said European markets were the main area where progress was
achieved.
'Mainland European sales benefited from increased original equipment
manufacture business which more than countered recessionary conditions.'
European operations contributed turnover of Pounds 30.4m (Pounds 26.2m) and
operating profits of Pounds 3.99m (Pounds 3.55m).
Scantronic has now split continental and UK operations to give 'greater
focus' to the overseas business, where it has a low market share.
There was a reduced operating loss of Pounds 153,000 (Pounds 591,000) from
the North American operations although turnover slipped to Pounds 8.68m
(Pounds 9.86m).
Mr Clapperton said: 'Despite our earlier expectations, the North American
market showed no sign of upturn. Progress to bring operations into line with
existing business levels was achieved through the strengthening of local
management and the launch of new products.'
Scantronic maintained a Pounds 2m spend on research and development, some 5
per cent of sales. Gearing was held at just under 20 per cent, and the
company generated more than Pounds 5m in cash for the second year in
succession, including Pounds 1m from US operations. Net interest charges
fell to Pounds 311,000 (Pounds 422,000).
The final dividend is 2.331p (2.185p) making 3.121p (2.975p) for the year,
payable from earnings of 4.05p (2.18p).

FT  15 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Pay-out in prospect for creditors of ACS
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CREDITORS of Atlantic Computer Systems, the main UK operating company in the
collapsed Atlantic Computer leasing group, may receive a dividend of between
10p and 15p in the pound, according to the company's joint liquidators.
Mr John Soden and Mr Richard Boys-Stones of Price Waterhouse were appointed
joint liquidators of ACS earlier this week following on from their
appointment as joint administrators in April 1990.
When Atlantic collapsed in 1990, dragging down its parent company, British &amp;
Commonwealth Holdings, ACS had liabilities of Pounds 500m - mostly
contingent liabilities arising from clauses in the company's portfolio of
more than 2,500 leases.
Since then, however, the administrators have achieved realisations after
costs of over Pounds 39m compared with initial estimates of about Pounds 16m
and have been successful in minimising liabilities through negotiations with
lessees and funders - removing some Pounds 85m of liabilities and dealing
with over 67 per cent of the leases.
Mr Soden said that although significant uncertainty will remain about the
level of dividend until all the claims have been received, 'we may be in a
position to pay a first dividend by the end of this year.'

FT  15 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Markheath shares dip on news of delay in
results
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES in Markheath, the property group 61 per cent-owned by the Australian
Adelaide Steamship and its associates, fell 1 1/4 p to 5 3/4 p yesterday on
news that it was to delay the announcement of its annual results.
Mr Ian Creber, finance director, said that negotiations with the group's
banks were continuing, causing the delay.
These talks have been going on since at least the January announcement of
the half-time results, when losses deepened to Pounds 4.71m (Pounds
459,000).
Mr Creber said that then the discussions were over the availability of
credit facilities; now they were about their maturity dates. He said that
rental income was 'not enough to cover the group's operating costs and bank
interest.
Markheath's financial restructuring, involving repair to the balance sheet,
is complicated by the fact that the directors believe, having studied
management accounts, that net assets have fallen below Pounds 15.26m, or
less than half of the called-up share capital.
Mr Creber insisted that this fall-off in net assets - from Pounds 55m at
March 31 1992 - did not trigger the delay in the results announcement.

FT  15 JUL 93 / Fewer punters flock to BT3 sale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RETAIL investors have shown a weaker appetite for the latest offer of BT
shares than they did in the previous sale in 1991.
With applications closing yesterday morning, they had applied for at least
800m shares, representing 1.3 times the minimum number of shares offered by
the government.
In 1991 the subscription rate was 1.6 times with applications for 1.7bn
shares chasing the 1.05bn sold.
The Share Information Office and larger share shops reported around 1.4m
applications, although this figure could rise a little after the final
count.
The government has earmarked 600m shares for UK retail investors, half of
the 1.2bn new BT shares in total on offer but has retained the right to
raise this figure to 67 per cent.
Institutional shareholders have made bids for more than 1.2bn, equal twice
the number offered at the moment. Analysts said the Treasury was less likely
to claw back more shares from the institutional offer to sell to retail
investors.
The government will raise more money from the Pounds 5bn sale if it gives
institutions, which are paying more for the shares, half of the total
allocation. The final decision on allocation will not be taken until
tomorrow morning.
More than half of BT shareholders and employees have applied for shares
compared with 15 per cent in the last sale in 1991. Retail investors have on
average applied for 600 shares at a total cost of Pounds 900, which is
similar to the last sale. The first instalment for small shareholders is
150p, compared with 160p for institutions.
The international offer remains open until 4pm tomorrow. The government will
over the weekend announce the price of the third instalment in the
partly-paid issue.
SG Warburg, the government's global co-ordinator, may buy back the partly
paid shares after they start trading on Monday as part of its stabilisation
programme to create an orderly after-market.
Warburg has warned institutions not to dump their existing shares before the
sale in the hope of buying them back cheaply.
Analysts say that the lower than usual volume of share trading before the
sale shows that the share price is artificially high.

FT  15 JUL 93 / CSFB struggles to tame its personalities: A case of banking
turmoil
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS and PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The powerful personalities of its top executives have always been both one
of the biggest strengths and one of the biggest weaknesses of CS First
Boston, the New York-based investment banking group.
Both Mr Archie Cox, appointed head of its First Boston subsidiary in the US
three years ago, and Mr Hans-Joerg Rudloff, who turned its London-based
Credit Suisse First Boston arm into one of the top houses in the
international capital markets during the 1980s, had a high profile at their
respective firms.
Yet personality clashes and business rivalries, particularly between New
York and London, have held back CS First Boston at a time when rivals like
Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley have extended their reach into the
international investment banking business.
CS First Boston has made various attempts to overcome the divisiveness. Last
month, for instance, it announced a reorganisation based on product lines
rather than geographic regions.
Mr Cox's sudden resignation on Tuesday, following Mr Rudloff's similarly
abrupt departure in March, strengthens the impression that the group is
trying to slough off its image as a collection of rival personal fiefdoms.
The precise disagreement that sparked Mr Cox's resignation - officially for
'personal reasons' - remains unclear, but it was not hard to see the
tensions building. The management reorganisation, begun earlier this year,
had eaten into Mr Cox's control over First Boston, making him one among a
small group of new senior managers, albeit the most powerful.
He had been named worldwide head of equities and co-head of investment
banking. Alongside him in the latter sat Mr David Mulford, a former US
Treasury secretary and Mr Rudloff's successor in London. Two other rising
stars were also grabbing at his coat-tails: Mr Bob Diamond and Mr Allen
Wheat, joint heads of fixed income.
The shake-up had coincided with a move by Mr Jack Hennessy, chief executive
of CS First Boston Group and a former head of the US subsidiary, to assert
greater control over the business.
Insiders report that Mr Hennesey has taken a more prominent role since the
upheaval began. He will take on Mr Cox's duties until a replacement is
found. The relationship between Mr Cox and Mr Hennessy was reportedly a
turbulent one.
If the shake-up had increased the pressure on Mr Cox, then so had a near
rebellion in New York over the disappointing level of 1992 bonuses. While
competitors have been raking in record profits amid the biggest bull market
the securities industry has seen, CS First Boston's earnings have proved
disappointing. Last year, the group reported net income of Dollars 175m,
down 19 per cent from the Dollars 215m earned in 1991.
In the US markets, First Boston has been struggling to stem a decline in its
share of the profitable securities underwriting business. Although First
Boston's share of all corporate debt and equity underwritten in the US held
steady at 9.6 per cent in the first half of this year, its share of
investment grade bond issues - a traditional strength at the firm - fell
from 9.2 per cent to 8 per cent, dropping the firm one place to sixth in the
league table of Wall Street underwriters.
The group has also been hampered by a poorly performing European operation.
Analysts in London have estimated that earnings from CSFB's UK unit fell 20
per cent last year to a meagre Dollars 20m. The high cost of its move to new
offices and heavy investment in Eastern Europe, together with a poor trading
performance in the last part of 1992, accounted for the fall.
London's decline led bonuses in New York to be pared back, prompting
disatisfaction there and a number of senior defections among traders. This
mirrored a similar wave of disaffection that swept through London three
years ago, when poor results in New York meant that London-based executives
were unable to reap the rewards of a bumper year.
The shake-up at the top is far from over. CS First Boston's new crop of
senior managers are as powerful as their predecessors, and it is as yet
unclear which of them will rise to the top. The ambitious Mr Mulford was
seen within the firm as a pretender to the top investment banking job even
before Mr Cox's departure.
Mr Wheat, meanwhile, has created the group's biggest profit earner in its
derivatives unit, Credit Suisse Financial Products, and brushed off any
suggestions that he was about to be sidelined by Mr Mulford's arrival.
The question is who will replace Mr Cox in the New York job. According to
one observer, Mr Hennessy is a 'hard-driving taskmaster' who is not easy to
work with. It may be that someone other than him will be needed to run the
US operation, possibly an outsider who does not have 'any IOUs at the firm'.
The appointment will be the most important yet in a year of big change.

FT  15 JUL 93 / SE faces more secrecy on trades
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE largest trades conducted on the London stock market will not have to be
made public until up to a week after they have taken place, if a proposal to
be put to the Stock Exchange's board today is adopted.
If approved, the change could boost the profits of London securities firms,
which claim current regulations expose them to losses.
The move would be a reduction in the level of transparency on the London
market, which already requires less disclosure of trade information than
other international markets.
The relaxation would apply only to the very biggest trades, in which a
marketmaker buys or sells a large block of shares. The delay in publication
would give marketmakers longer to lay off their risks before competitors
were alerted to their positions.
The rule change would apply only to trades which are at least 75 times
bigger than the average trade in a company's shares (known as the 'normal
market size'). Details would have to be published only after the marketmaker
had laid off at least 90 per cent of its own risk, though publication of all
trades would be obligatory after a week.
The proposal is the latest step in a five-year battle between UK
marketmakers and regulators over trade publication. Securities houses have
argued that London's marketmaking system, unlike the auction systems in most
other large stock markets, will only operate with a degree of secrecy.
The rule change is understood to have been approved by the Securities and
Investments Board, the Department of Trade and Industry and a number of City
trade groups.
The London International Financial Futures Exchange is believed to have
resisted the change, arguing that reducing the level of transparency would
harm trading in the FT-SE 100 futures contract.
Under the proposed rule change, it would be left to each securities house to
decide for itself when 90 per cent of its risk had been laid off.
Regulators hope that the concession to the marketmakers, though reducing
disclosure of block trades, will lead to greater disclosure of other routine
transactions.
Marketmakers can now get around the need to publish all trades within 90
minutes by agreeing a 'protected trade' with a client. Here, the marketmaker
guarantees a certain price for a trade, but promises to try to improve on it
during the day. The trade is not reported and published until it has been
confirmed.
Regulators fear that normal trades are being dressed up as protected trades
to bypass the publication rules. By allowing marketmakers greater secrecy on
large deals, the regulators hope they will be less likely to use protected
trades.

FT  15 JUL 93 / Accounting changes obliterate Tiphook's profits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES in Tiphook fell by 27p to 259p after the UK transport rental company
announced a change in accounting policy which wiped out its profits.
Mr Robert Montague, chairman, said accounting policy was being changed to
reflect the increasing number of US shareholders. The proportion of the
group's equity held as American Depositary Receipts has risen from 2 per
cent in 1991 to just over 50 per cent. About 65 per cent of the group's
Pounds 1.16bn borrowings are in the US.
Annual profits before tax and various charges fell from Pounds 86.4m to
Pounds 55.5m, in line with analysts' reduced expectations. However, Tiphook
said that from now it would report in dollars and the results would more
closely reflect US accounting conventions. The group said applying the new
accountancy policy led to predominantly one-off charges of Pounds 77.3m,
giving a pre-tax loss of Pounds 21.8m in the year to April 30. Turnover
increased marginally from Pounds 322m to Pounds 324m.
One analyst said the changes 'just muddy the waters further'.
The drop in the proportion of UK shareholders - from 60 per cent to less
than 30 per cent of the equity - reflects the disgruntlement of UK
institutional investors, who have seen the group's share price halved in
less than two years. Their tolerance has also been tested by share price
falls ahead of two recent company announcements - a profits warning in April
and last week's notification of the proposed accountancy changes.
Some shareholders have pressed for more non-executive directors and
expressed concern over the high remuneration enjoyed by executives. Mr
Montague said there were no plans to change the board. Tiphook would remain
UK domiciled.
He added that US investors seemed more comfortable with leasing companies
such as Tiphook, which although heavily geared were strongly
cash-generative. Operating cashflow in the year had been Pounds 163.9m, down
13 per cent.
Tiphook said its biggest business, containers, had shown resilience to the
recession. Utilisation had averaged 82 per cent, compared with 88 per cent,
but average rental rates fell by less than 2 per cent.
Under the new standard, there was a loss per share of 41.2p, compared with
earnings of 46.3p. A final dividend of 14.4p gives a total of 21.2p, against
19p.

FT  15 JUL 93 / P&amp;G to unveil cost-cutting package at rare meeting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PROCTER &amp; GAMBLE, the US consumer products giant, is expected to unveil a
wide-ranging cost reduction programme, probably including substantial job
cuts, at a rare meeting today with Wall Street analysts.
The meeting comes two days after P&amp;G, which faces increasing competition
from cut-price labels, announced plans to slash the price of its liquid
laundry detergents in the US market.
That move is expected to hurt not only the manufacturers of cheaper products
but also Anglo-Dutch Unilever, P&amp;G's main US rival. Unilever's shares fell
24p to 593p on the London Stock Exchange yesterday.
The analysts' meeting at the company's headquarters in Cincinnati, Ohio,
will be the first held by Mr Edwin Artzt, P&amp;G's chairman, since May 1990.
P&amp;G, an unusually secretive company, is expected to spell out how it intends
to reach its previously announced goal of cutting overheads as a percentage
of net sales from 14.5 per cent to 12 per cent over the next three years.
Some analysts have speculated that this could involve the loss of 10,000 of
the group's 102,000 jobs around the world. However, the overwhelming
majority of any reductions is expected to be voluntary, through early
retirement and similar programmes.
P&amp;G needs to prune costs to complement the price cuts it has been making to
maintain market share in the face of competition from discounted brands.
It has revamped its US marketing strategy, introducing a policy of 'value
pricing'. This involves cutting down on short-term, deep-discount
promotional deals, which periodically slash the cost of products to the
retailer, and replacing them with a system of more consistent lower prices.
However, the change has stirred up opposition among less efficient
retailers, who have relied on deep-discount promotions for a substantial
part of their profits.
Tuesday's detergent price cuts stem from this marketing battle. P&amp;G is
cutting the price of its Tide and Cheer liquid detergents by 15 per cent
from August 2, with lesser reductions on other detergents, dishwashing
liquid and fabric softener.
The company indicated the move was aimed at narrowing the gap between its
products and cheaper brands, but analysts said it appeared as much a strike
against Unilever, which has just introduced super-concentrated versions of
its liquid detergents.
'There is no better time for price cuts than in a competitor's new product
launch,' said Mr Gabriel Lowy, of securities firm Oppenheimer &amp; Co.

FT  15 JUL 93 / Attali comes under harsh attack: EBRD chief may bring
forward departure after critical audit report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JACQUES ATTALI, president of the European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development, will be severely criticised in a report on financial
mismanagement at the bank to be published tomorrow.
Following a two-month investigation, the bank's audit committee is putting
the finishing touches to the report. Bank employees who have seen the
initial draft say it focuses on four areas of financial mismanagement by Mr
Attali. It says the EBRD chief:
Wasted thousands of pounds by taking more than 40 flights on private jets
supplied by French company, Air Entreprise.
Received fees for giving speeches on several occasions, contrary to the
bank's code of conduct.
Charged personal expenses to the bank, including several trips to the London
nightclub, Annabels. These have been reimbursed but in some cases there was
an 18-month delay before the reimbursement was made.
Had a close relationship with Mr Jean-Louis Berthet, the architect used in
the Pounds 55.5m project to furnish the bank's headquarters, which
undermined the ability of the building contractor, Bovis, to control the
construction project.
Also criticised are two other executives, Mr Pierre Pissaloux, who until
recently held the posts of director of the cabinet and of the budget, though
he is now only cabinet director, and Mr Anders Ljungh, the bank's
vice-president in charge of finance.
Mr Pissaloux is accused of poor judgment in his management of the building
project, allowing overspending in certain areas. However, he is praised for
the speed with which the project was finished. Mr Ljungh is accused of not
keeping sufficient control of bank spending.
The bank's board of 23 directors, who represent the countries and agencies
which own the bank, are also rebuked for approving and then increasing the
budget for furnishing the office without receiving sufficient information on
why more than Pounds 50m was required.
In June, Mr Attali announced his intention to resign as president following
disclosures that he had taken Dollars 30,000 in fees for speaking at a
conference and had also been reimbursed twice for a first-class return
flight to Japan.
He said at the time he would go when a permanent successor took up office,
which is unlikely until September. He was not at the bank yesterday. One
bank executive said: 'The audit report is so critical of him, I suspect he
may decide to quit this week.'
Mr Pissaloux is praised for other actions. At the end of last year, Mr
Pissaloux took away the corporate credit card issued to Mr Francois Olive,
Mr Attali's personal assistant, who organised Mr Attali's travel and
entertaining, when he became concerned at the expenses charged to it.
At the beginning of this year, Mr Pissaloux also forced Mr Attali to get
competing quotes from aircraft charter companies before renting private
jets.
The audit committee, chaired by Swedish director, Mr Claes de Neergaard,
employed consultants from Coopers &amp; Lybrand to carry out much of the
investigation, which concentrated on the building refurbishment, the use of
private jets and Mr Attali's management of his expense account.

FT  15 JUL 93 / New laws urged to counter black market in secret data
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RACHEL JOHNSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEW LAWS are needed to stamp out the black market in confidential personal
information, the data protection registrar said yesterday.
Mr Eric Howe, the registrar, is so concerned about the market in
computerised data on individuals' income tax, bank accounts and credit cards
he has asked the home secretary to launch a parliamentary investigation.
Mr Howe said at a news conference at which he presented the agency's ninth
annual report: 'I have drawn it to the attention of the home secretary . . .
and it may be that ministers and parliament might like to consider a wider
inquiry to find out what is this market, how big is it, how easy is it to
use.'
He wants the government to consider whether there should be stronger
legislation against those who force 'disclosure (of personal data) by
deceit'.
The Data Protection Act requires banks and other personal data users to have
appropriate security for the information they hold. Data users of this type
have to register under the act if they disclose personal details to another
authorised organisation such as a credit reference agency.
However, Mr Howe sees a possible weakness in the law as it stands since
unauthorised people can fool data users into handing over information such
as bank account details.
The black market has arisen either because bank staff supply details
knowingly to third parties with no legitimate access or because they are
duped into giving away confidential information to unauthorised private
agents posing as authorised users and hired mainly to collect debts.
Banks and finance houses have become more concerned about leaks of
information after complaints by Mr Norman Lamont, the former chancellor, and
Ms Stella Rimington, the head of MI5, that the security of personal files
had been breached.
The British Bankers' Association has been reviewing security in banks after
reports that 'tracing agents' were bribing banks' staff to obtain the
internal codes required to authenticate telephone inquiries.
The registrar believes stronger sanctions are needed as well as improved
security at the banks.
Mr Howe also warned that the reissue of National Health Service numbers
could introduce a system of national identification by the back door. He
doubted whether the use of NHS numbers would be adequately restricted by
Crown Copyright.
Complaints by individuals to the registrar about the use of their personal
data rose from 1,747 in 1992 to 4,590 this year after a television campaign.

FT  15 JUL 93 / The Lex Column: BT3
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Calculators will doubtless be working overtime in the investing institutions
to gauge the retail demand for BT3. Since retail investors are said to have
applied for at least 800m shares, against the 600m on offer, that implies
the 1.4m or so applicants have applied for a minimum of 570 shares each.
However, the public is unlikely to have applied for more than the 630 shares
tendered for in BT2, since the first payment is much larger this time. All
of which suggests that while the public has applied for more than 800m
shares, the final total may not be much more than 900m.
The 600m share institutional offer closes tomorrow and there seem to be bids
for around 1.2bn shares. Those tenders are clustering around a 10p premium
to the price on BT's fully paid shares, reflecting the time value of money.
It would thus seem unlikely that the Treasury would increase the retail
element to 800m and cut institutions back, since fund managers are paying a
higher price, and small investors may also have bid for more shares than
they expect to get. If these prove to be the final figures, the offer will
count as a modest success. Whether the same can be said of the excessive
hype and baffling advertising campaign is another matter.

FT  15 JUL 93 / The Lex Column: UK inflation
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
If Tuesday's industrial production and yesterday's inflation figures had not
arrived on government notepaper, the casual observer might have thought they
related to Japan. The UK does seem to have survived the first wave of price
pressure from devaluation, due to low wage inflation and a yawning gap in
the productive potential of the UK economy. Manufacturers are even managing
to restore margins despite subdued price rises. One area where this may not
be true is food retailing, where costs are rising but retail prices are
under pressure. Those fat margins built up in recession may soon start to
slim.

FT  15 JUL 93 / The Lex Column: CSFB
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The resignation of Mr Archibald Cox as head of its US operations suggests
CSFB is some way from achieving management stability. Having appointed Mr
David Mulford to the top job in London in March - in place of the
established Mr Hans Joerg Rudloff - it might have hoped for a period of
calm. Mr Cox hardly has a record of precipitate career moves, so it is hard
to believe that bickering over the level of bonuses paid in New York played
more than an incidental role. That raises the question of whether his
departure is a symptom of a deeper malaise. Like other globally-minded
investment banks, CSFB must mould an integrated business from the far flung
parts of its empire. Splitting into regional units in 1988 to accommodate
the buy-out of First Boston proved an unsatisfactory response. In an era of
cross-border capital flows, organising an investment bank geographically
makes little sense. By reshaping itself into product groups earlier this
year, CSFB has belatedly fallen into line with practice elsewhere. Since
that involved curtailing the power of regional chiefs, friction was always
likely.
If Mr Cox's resignation has indeed arisen out of the decision to impose a
more rational management structure, CSFB could emerge stronger from the
upheaval. Having clung to the idea of regional units for so long, though, it
has lost ground against the best of the competition. What the company really
needs now is a focus on profitability rather than personalities.

FT  15 JUL 93 / The Lex Column: Tiphook
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Tiphook's reputation for impenetrable accounting will only be enhanced by
its latest changes. Since the bulk of its revenues are in dollars, the
switch to dollar-based accounting is superficially reasonable. All the more
so since most of its debt and almost 50 per cent of its shareholders are in
the US. But blaming a Pounds 77.3m profits hit on these accounting changes
is rich when most of the charges would have been incurred anyway. The Pounds
16m cost of unwinding its interest rate swaps position would have affected
profits under its old policies. So, too, would the punitively expensive
Pounds 21m cost of redeeming Pounds 150m of preference shares.
Such irritations might have been overlooked had Tiphook's underlying
business held much appeal. But with poor annual figures, a patchy trading
outlook and escalating competition, the company has a real fight on its
hands. Year-end gearing of 473 per cent, which comes close to the ceiling
imposed by its articles of association, constrains it further. Although high
gearing is normal for leasing companies, a likely interest bill three times
forecast profits is a worrying ratio nonetheless. Despite the hefty dividend
yield, there seems little reason to risk holding Tiphook's shares.

FT  15 JUL 93 / The Lex Column: Bursting branded bubbles
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Procter &amp; Gamble's price offensive in the US detergents market has blown
more bubbles up the noses of investors worried about brand values. There may
be specific reasons for P&amp;G's campaign: the need to counter Unilever's
launch of super-concentrated detergents being one. But the move also
reflects the general industry shift towards the latest fad of everyday low
pricing. P&amp;G has been cutting the promotional spend on 70 per cent of its
products, allowing it to reduce prices. The sums may only work, though, if
P&amp;G is able to make similar cuts in costs. P&amp;G's press conference today may
reveal how.
The question worrying investors, though, is whether such moves are short
term expedients designed to address flagging sales or longer term strategies
which will re-write the rules of the branded game. Trading conditions have
changed greatly since the 1980s. Companies are being forced to adapt.
Whereas the 1974 and 1981 recessions were followed by bursts of medium
economic growth and high inflation, the outlook for the 1990s is for low
growth and low inflation. This is squeezing consumers' discretionary
spending and emphasising value.
That said, branded companies able to offer demonstrably superior products at
modest premium prices should continue to thrive. The 5 per cent fall in
Unilever's shares over the past two days is surely overdone. But such
companies will have to overcome a wave of adverse sentiment before they can
hope to reverse their recent share price weakness.

FT  15 JUL 93 / A voice for the oppressed: The strength and appeal of
Islamic fundamentalist movements throughout the Middle East
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROGER MATTHEWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Moslems in turmoil: terror sheikh surrenders after Brooklyn mosque drama.'
The recent headline in a British Sunday newspaper articulates a widespread
western view of Islamic fundamentalism and its association with terrorism.
'West anxious to refuse Moslem peace force', the headline in one of
yesterday's papers, emphasises just how uncomfortably that perception sits
alongside the west's failure to ease the worsening plight of the Bosnian
people, and the mounting frustration of Islamic leaders at being blocked
from coming to the aid of their co-religionists.
The offer by seven members of the Islamic Conference Organisation to provide
17,000 troops, including 10,000 Iranians, for peacekeeping duties in Bosnia
poses an acute dilemma for the west, precisely because it feeds the fear of
Islamic extremism getting a foothold in Europe.
Foremost among those international leaders who endorse that interpretation
is Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the prime minister of Israel. 'They (the
fundamentalists) are starting to build an infrastructure of terror all over
the world,' he told a Paris audience last week. 'They will not tolerate the
presence of any foreign, non-Islamic entity in the Middle East. They will
fight all the moderate Arab regimes.'
After the arrest in New York of eight men, accused of plotting explosions
and identified instantly by police as Islamic fundamentalists, the American
public was similarly left in little doubt by some of its politicians that
the US was itself under threat. It is an assumption already reflected in US
Middle East policy, where the containment of Iran, described by Washington
as the world's foremost sponsor of terrorism, has been given top priority.
Senior officials in Washington emphasise that the US has nothing against
Islamic regimes as such. The Saudi Arabian government, for example, is more
fundamentalist than most. It is also authoritarian, denies any movement
towards political pluralism, refuses women the right to drive cars, beheaded
66 miscreants in public last year, and is spending billions of dollars on
building up its military machine. The US views Saudi Arabia as a close
friend and its staunchest ally in the Gulf.
On the other hand, Iran, which also defines itself as an Islamic state and,
according to Amnesty International, executed 330 people last year, has
elections of a sort and a functioning parliament, allows women to drive
cars, and is spending a fraction of the Saudi Arabian outlay on new
weaponry. Together with President Saddam Hussein's Iraq, it is described by
the US as a grave threat to world stability.
The basic difference between Iran and Saudi Arabia, at least when viewed
from Washington, is that one sees the US as the Great Satan while the other
sees it as the Great Saviour. Put another way, Washington has much less of a
problem with the domestic policies of Islamic governments than it does with
their external posturing.
In part this is because Islamic fundamentalism has, for the past 15 years,
been primarily a rallying point and a focus for dissent against regimes
which permitted no alternative political voice and were sometimes allied to
the US. The Iranian leadership under Ayatollah Khomeini saw America as the
root of all evil and its presence in the Middle East a provocation to all
Moslems. Iran still sees its role as coming to the aid of oppressed Moslems
anywhere in the world, but especially in the Middle East.
After 14 years of Islamic government, Iran cannot claim much success abroad,
or at home. Despite all the talk of exporting revolution, there is not a lot
to show. Equally, the sorry state of the Iranian economy leaves little to
crow about. But what Iran has been able to do, to a modest extent, is
capitalise on the political and economic failures of others. In the process
its capacity for trouble-making has been purposely exaggerated, not least by
some Middle Eastern leaders such as President Hosni Mubarak, who for months
has been crediting Iran with the prime responsibility for terrorist attacks
in Egypt.
Outside Iran, fundamentalist or radical Islamic movements have thrived most
where there has also been the partial collapse of the state (Lebanon and
Sudan), where economic deprivation and disparities have been particularly
marked (Algeria and Egypt), and as a consequence of occupation (the West
Bank, Gaza and Lebanon). They have been additionally aided by the more
general perception among Arab populations that their governments have failed
them.
The movements which inspired millions in the post-colonial era - Nasserism,
Arab socialism, Arab nationalism, Arab unity in all its different guises -
have collapsed. The depth of the region's political malaise was never better
illustrated than by the often contradictory Arab reactions to Iraq's
invasion of Kuwait. Against this background, slogans such as 'Islam Is The
Solution' are destined to rally support. But there is no structure or
uniformity to the response. No populist Islamic army is forming under green
banners and curved scimitars to drive out the corrupt and morally bankrupt
before moving on to deal with the infidels. Instead, there is a multiplicity
of Islamic organisations, even within a single country, a wide range of
objectives, and little articulation of what Islam thinks is The Solution.
Where there is a degree of international co-ordination it stems primarily
from Iran. Even then it is difficult to identify who is responsible when
power is shared between spiritual leader, president, parliament, ministers,
senior ayatollahs, religious institutions and religious foundations.
Contradictions are inevitable. The country's economic reconstruction
programme needs to attract western capital and technology, but its foreign
policy, especially on the Middle East peace process, is diametrically
opposed to US and European efforts.
Iran's successes have been greatest where Israel has blundered out of the
frying pan into the fire, most notably in its efforts to smash opposition to
its military occupation in the West Bank, Gaza and Lebanon. The harsh
response to the five-year Palestinian uprising in the occupied territories
has given Hamas, the radical group supported by Iran, the chance to draw
popular support away from the more moderate Fatah, the dominant component in
the Palestine Liberation Organisation headed by Mr Yassir Arafat.
In south Lebanon, the formerly quiescent Shia population was politicised by
Israel's invasions in 1978 and 1982. The invasions succeeded in ending the
Palestinian military threat to Israel's northern border but contributed to
the birth of Hizbollah, which is also backed by Iran and was responsible for
seizing western hostages in Beirut. Hizbollah not only continues to inflict
more casualties on Israeli troops than the Palestinian guerrillas, but has
become an important element in determining Lebanon's political stability.
Conversations with officials in Tehran leave little doubt that Iran sees its
allies in the occupied territories and its co-religionists in Lebanon as
offering direct leverage on the peace process and on wider American-Israeli
plans. Just how extensive Iranian ambitions are is difficult to assess, but
it would seem obvious that Iran will seek to exploit the weaknesses in the
pro-American Arab alliance that Washington is seeking to maintain.
One of the keys to that alliance is Egypt, among the most immediate targets
of Islamic extremists. The activities of a handful of terrorists during the
past year have unnerved the regime, especially as they have aimed
principally at the tourist industry, the country's biggest single source of
foreign revenue. But while there is plentiful evidence of dissent in Cairo's
poorest suburbs, there is no sign of the explosive discontent which led to
the country's mass riots in January 1977.
Egyptians are famously slow to rouse and, as the 1977 riots showed, it was
government blundering rather than opposition agitation which triggered
public anger. The Moslem Brotherhood, for decades Egypt's main
standard-bearer of political Islam, is winning greater public support, but
it seems to be more by default that by any specific policies it has to
offer. An hour spent seeking to draw out a party spokesman elicited only the
repeated assertion that all the answers to Egypt's myriad problems are
contained in the Koran.
But if Islamic groups are reticent about precise policies, they are learning
fast how to operate at the grassroots. Islamic groups in several countries
have understood the effectiveness of social welfare schemes and have taken
full advantage of any opportunities to become part of the political
establishment. Leading the way are Hizbollah in Lebanon, the Islamic
Salvation Front in Algeria, and the Moslem Brotherhood in Egypt and to a
lesser extent in Jordan.
In Lebanon, devastated by 17 years of civil war, Hizbollah runs schools,
hospitals and clinics, provides housing, and administers shops which sell
subsidised food. It put up candidates for last year's general elections, and
its eight members of parliament set an example by the enthusiasm with which
they participate in debates and sub-committees. Hizbollah is also the only
faction not to have been disarmed, on the basis that it is fighting to eject
Israel from the south in order to restore national sovereignty. In short,
Hizbollah has covered all the options.
Allowing Hizbollah into the democratic process posed relatively few risks in
Lebanon where representation is regulated according to the size of the
country's religious minorities. But in Algeria - where there was no such
limitation and the ruling party had little popular support - a sudden plunge
into democracy by a desperate government allowed the protest vote to swing
massively to the Islamic Salvation Front. It was only stopped from taking
power by the regime halting the electoral process, pushing the country
towards worsening political violence.
President Mubarak says he warned Algeria's leaders of precisely that danger.
He has no intention of legalising the Moslem Brotherhood in Egypt and
permitting it to fight an election against the officially sponsored National
Democratic party. However, there seems equally little prospect of the NDP as
constituted ever winning mass support, a vacuum which the Islamic groups are
in part trying to fill with welfare programmes similar to those adopted by
Hizbollah.
Groups of Egyptian liberal intellectuals have warned Mr Mubarak of the risks
if the government continues with its confrontational 'them or us' policy.
Harsh police measures to crush the Islamic challenge is not an answer, they
argue, except perhaps for Syria, where the brutal suppression of the 1982
revolt in the town of Hama has broken the back of opposition to the regime
for more than a decade.
But it has not provided the answer to what or who follows President Hafez
al-Assad, any more than other Arab regimes have managed to create
institutions which will provide for orderly and popular transfers of power.
Such failures have allowed the perception to gain ground in the Middle East
that it is only the Islamic movements which truly care for the poor and
oppressed, an impression heightened by the collapse of communism and the
Soviet Union and what are seen as hostile American attitudes.
In the slums of Cairo, among the squatters in the wreckage of downtown
Beirut, in Baghdad or Khartoum, the assertion that the US is at war with
Islam falls on receptive ears. However justified the Gulf war was by
international law, the further missile attacks on Baghdad and the continued
sanctions which bear most heavily on ordinary Iraq people can be all too
easily arranged to fit a specific message.
The west's failure to save the Moslems of Bosnia adds substantially to that
message and will be further reinforced if it refuses the offer of an Islamic
peacekeeping contribution. And, of course, there is Israel. Despite 20
months of American-sponsored peace talks it shows little sign of withdrawing
from the occupied territories or relinquishing east Jerusalem.
Such issues bear far more heavily on the lives of most Moslems in the Middle
East than the prominently headlined activities of a few extremists in New
York. If the wider concerns of Moslems are not accorded more equal
prominence, the US and its allies may be unable to check the growing
suspicion that Islam is being elected to succeed communism as the primary
threat to western values and political order.

FT  15 JUL 93 / Leading Article: Lords' day
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE last century, Parliament's House of Lords was described by Bagehot as
a dignified rather than an efficient part of the UK constitution. Widening
the suffrage had led to the triumph of the democratic Commons over the
aristocratic Lords. But yesterday their lordships again found themselves at
the centre of the political debate as anti-Maastricht campaigners urged them
to overturn the Commons by voting for a referendum on the treaty.
Both sides in the debate assiduously courted the 'backwoodsmen', the
hereditary lords who rarely attend debates. Last time they turned out in
force was in 1988, to defeat moves to introduce an element of progressivity
in the poll tax. Their pivotal role in so doing was equally controversial,
because many of these wealthy but unelected legislators gained hugely from
the abolition of rates.
Attempts to reform the House of Lords have been fraught with difficulty,
however. It may be anachronistic that the UK's upper house is largely
composed of peers who have either inherited their titles or received them as
beneficiaries of the prime minister's patronage. It may be absurd that this
large and unwieldy body which meets more frequently than almost any other
legislature in the world in practice wields very little power. But finding
cross-party agreement on how to reform the Lords has repeatedly foundered,
not least because many MPs prefer a toothless second chamber that is unable
to challenge the Commons' democratic credentials.
Yet a second chamber that enjoyed greater legitimacy could do much to
improve the quality of Britain's governance, as a pamphlet published today
by the left-leaning Institute for Public Policy Research points out. It
would be better able to amend and improve bad legislation. Its authority
would be strengthened in scrutinising the work of the European Community. It
could vet appointments to quangos, providing checks on the exercise of
ministerial patronage. And it could be given special powers to veto
constitutional changes which would therefore require the endorsement of both
houses.
But it can do none of these things well without the legitimacy conferred by
democracy. That means elections for most or all of its members, though there
is a case for some appointees to represent special interest groups such as
business, religious organisations and ethnic minorities. Dignity should give
way to legitimacy in the UK's upper house.

FT  15 JUL 93 / Leading Article: Improving the World Bank
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE WORLD Bank is never going to be loved. With a portfolio of Dollars 140bn
invested in 1,800 projects and programmes, it is too powerful for that. It
can hope only to be respected. But to win that respect, it must be both open
and tough, open about its failures, tough on its shareholders and, most of
all, itself. With its 'agenda for improving development effectiveness', the
bank is taking steps in the right direction.
The bank's prime aim of poverty reduction can, in the words of its
president, Mr Lewis Preston, be attained only 'by restoring or accelerating
economic growth and by focusing on policies and programmes that specifically
benefit the poor'. The bank tries to turn such benign intentions into
reality via its lending.
To Mr Preston's credit, he decided to find out how well the bank's lending
was working. The answer, it turns out, was not very well. The proportion of
operations in progress that had 'major problems' had risen from 11 per cent
in 1981 to 20 per cent a decade later. In agriculture, 25 per cent of
projects were in difficulty. The bank's Operations Evaluations Department
judged only 63 per cent of completed operations to be satisfactory in 1991,
a sharp decline from the 85 per cent achieved in 1981.
This looks dreadful. So, in many ways, it is. But oversimplification must be
avoided. It would be easy for the bank to improve its performance by
avoiding innovative, risky or complex projects, particularly in the poorest
countries. Furthermore, many failures are to be explained by adverse global
developments, such as deteriorating terms of trade and high real interest
rates. Also important has been the poor state of many borrowers' economies.
The debt crisis inflicted serious damage, for example, though these
difficulties usually reflected and, in turn, contributed to wider economic
mismanagement.
Nevertheless, the bank does bear much of the blame. It is simultaneously a
financial intermediary, a dispenser of largesse and a supplier of advice.
All these objectives have to be served by its lending operations. Conflicts
inevitably arise. In practice, effectiveness has too often been subordinated
to the desire to expand lending and remain on good terms with clients, who
are also shareholders.
The bank's proposed solutions are to move the management of country
portfolios to centre stage in its dialogue with borrowers; to foster
'genuine partnership' with borrower agencies; to ensure the participation of
the poor; to restructure ongoing operations when necessary; to simplify
project design; to improve the management of operations; and to enhance the
role played by operations evaluation. It also aims to redirect internal
incentives towards rewarding successful progress in projects, from project
approval.
This is fine, so far as it goes. But it does not go far enough. The bank
cannot force governments to do what they do not want to do. Similarly, it
cannot give countries honest and effective government. What the bank can do
is decide whether a particular government or borrower is worthy of support.
If the conditions for effective use of resources do not exist, the bank must
walk away, explaining clearly both to the client and to a wider audience why
it has decided to do so.
This will take courage. But it will also demand greater openness. The bank
needs to see an informed public opinion as its friend. Some of the bank's
critics will never be mollified. But many in both developed and developing
countries want the bank to succeed in its prime goal of helping reduce
poverty. They also recognise that developing countries need honest and
effective government, implementing sensible policy. If the bank stands
firmly for that, it will deserve respect. If it is seen to stand for that,
it will receive it.

FT  15 JUL 93 / Leading Article: German mould
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
YESTERDAY'S announcement that the Bavarian state government is to sell off
its 8 per cent stake in Deutsche Aerospace provides a further indication of
the degree to which unification's turbulent aftermath is shaking the
foundations of the German economic system. The united Germany which
eventually emerges from the current recession will differ from the old west
Germany in more profound respects than just population and geography.
Necessity, rather than ideology, is the primary reason for the Bavarian
Land's decision. No one can doubt the urgent need to raise revenue from any
source possible, both centrally and regionally, in order to close Germany's
gaping government budget deficit.
But the sale - the first significant divestiture by a regional
administration of a strategic industrial stake, originally taken to aid the
postwar reconstruction - does mark a significant moment in Germany's
economic evolution. Many other state habits, such as the vast panoply of
subsidies and holdings, may not survive the budgetary squeeze.
Nor is the state sector alone being shaken up. Three years of high interest
rates and a strong D-Mark have forced German industry to think hard about
ways to cut costs and become more competitive. Companies are, as a result,
looking beyond Germany's borders: to New York for capital, and to east and
south Europe for cheaper labour.
Germany's social partners are, meanwhile, slowly modifying past practices
which have sometimes stressed regulated uniformity over competition and
flexibility. The strains in east Germany resulting from Germany's
co-ordinated wage-bargaining system signal the need for change; the draft
law on flexible working hours, approved by the cabinet this week, suggests
it is beginning.
This is not an obituary for an economic model which, in the main, has served
postwar Germany well. The structure of German industry is, and will remain,
very different from the Anglo-Saxon model: secrecy remains highly prized,
public companies are much less common, ownership is more concentrated,
industrial cross-holdings are normal and hostile takeovers rare.
Yet change will continue at the margin. For even if the Bundesbank chooses
to cut interest rates at today's council meeting - and the French
authorities must surely hope it will - the pressure on industry to become
more competitive can only intensify.

Talk about charity beginning at home. Yesterday's Independent illustrated
its report on the restored dividend at estate agents Savills with a picture
of a country house. The caption read: ' . . . Lower Roundhurst near
Hazelmere, Lancashire, is priced at Pounds 1.8m.'
What wasn't mentioned was that the property belongs to one of the Indy's
columnists who'll no doubt welcome the publicity for the sale -
share-tipster Jim Slater.
Even so, the paper stopped short of putting potential buyers directly on the
scent. The house is not in Hazelmere, Lancashire, but Haslemere, Surrey.

News that just departed Bank of England governor Robin Leigh-Pemberton has
taken the title of Lord Kingsdown caught Observer off-guard. Didn't
Kingsdown in Kent already have a lord of the manor in Kenneth Noye, one of
the brains behind the 1982 Brinks-Mat bullion robbery?
Perhaps the former guardian of Britain's gold was moving in to search for
the still missing bulk of the robbers' undercover reserves. But the odds
would surely be against him in an area where many of the houses look as
though they must have been built without planning permission, besides being
guarded by rottweilers.
Wrong track, however. The said Kingsdown has nothing to do with
Leigh-Pemberton's new title, which has a spotless record indeed. It has been
kept unused for over a century, dating back to one of Leigh-Pemberton's
great great grandads who died childless.

But if the two union bosses can't think of anything to say to the would-be

<TEXT>
'Nothing to worry about, there's always a bit of unrest at this time of the
year,' Britain's Beijing embassy assured visiting members of the House of
Commons foreign affairs committee in May 1989.
What they'd inquired about was student demonstrations in Tiananmen Square -
which left some of the visitors with what one of them, Conservative Michael
Jopling, terms 'the view that the embassy was not in touch with what was
going on'.
With the committee planning to go to Beijing again, Jopling yesterday asked
the subsequently appointed ambassador, Sir Robin McLaren, in London between
talks with China about Hong Kong, if the embassy's eyes were sharper these
days.
Perhaps more used to silken diplomacy than direct confrontation, the envoy
replied that he had read all the embassy's cables in 1989 and could assure
the committee members that it had been 'by no means complacent or
dismissive'. Nor was his snapshot of the present position likely to change
Jopling's view.
Communist countries were difficult to understand, it went, rather like a
lake with black water and currents running beneath the surface. The present
situation in China was 'very interesting' and the ambassador could not
predict the future with confidence.

Good to see someone preserving a sense of humour amid the massacre on Lime
Street. David Springbett, who yesterday published a modified version of the
London insurance market's official business plan, wants to 'springclean the
place'.
Hence the scheme's title: 'Lysold', an old-fashioned cleaning fluid, which
just happens to be an anagram of Lloyd's.
While he may be a self-styled 'expert bullshitter', Springbett clearly has
staying power. Witness his entries in the Guinness Book of Records, which
include the fastest round-the-world trip on a commercial airliner.
Twelve years ago he found himself above the Atlantic seated beside a
striking girl called Paddy, who alas didn't see him as her ideal man. Not
content with pointing out that he was fat, she mentioned that her current
beau was Arnold Schwarzenegger who'd famously earnt a Guinness Book entry as
the most perfectly formed man.
Divining that a mention in said esteemed tome was the key to the young
lady's heart, Springbett contemplated his navel in quest of a way. He hit on
the round-the-world trip for which, being a good insurance professional, he
hedged himself with the bookies at 25 to 1.
Then a quick word with the publisher secured him a quarter-page colour photo
in the next edition - one up on Schwarzenegger, who Springbett claims had
achieved only a black and white.
Upon publication, the young lady accepted his hand, and the two are still
blissfully married. Here's hoping she goes on inspiring him to great deeds.

FT  15 JUL 93 / Letter: Private View obscures complexity of living species
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PAUL MUNTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The Private View interview with Claude Martin, the new director of
World Wide Fund for Nature (July 9/10), seemed to miss the point.
Dr Martin might have been asked if the Panda symbol was not now so prominent
that it obscured the complexity and importance of the work that goes on
under its logo. Pandas and other 'cuddlies' have long been the advertising
front for funding of a lot of hard-headed thought and work on the diversity
of life on earth, from viruses to vertebrates, and the relationship of that
diversity with the economic, ethical and spiritual life of humans.
Each living species is more complex than any man made machine. Very few
individuals of any species are the same, and their inter-relations so
intricate as to be largely beyond human elucidation. To demand the moral
justification of conserving the angonoka tortoise is as irrelevant as a Tory
government asking the same question about any particular small business
during a time of depression.
Given the bent of the FT, a deeper examination might have been appropriate:
of Martin's view on the implications of taking funds from industrial and
economic interest groups; on environmental action by industry; and upon
ensuring the continued availability of biological resources to man.
These are complex and important issues and their treatment in your feature
may be likened to an interview with the chairman of the stock exchange on
the simplistic and outmoded basis that he oversaw a casino and that
capitalism contained the seeds of its own destruction.

FT  15 JUL 93 / Letter: BT services already taken to air
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr COLIN BROWNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, As many of your readers will have discovered for themselves, BT has
offered a worldwide commercial in-flight telephone service since September
1990 ('Mercury to start in-flight phone lines', July 7).
BT's Skyphone service, operated in conjunction with our partners, Singapore
Telecom and Norwegian Telecom, is used by two leading airlines - Singapore
Airlines and Air China. The consortium is also in detailed discussion with
other airlines.
Earlier this year, BT launched the world's first global airborne fax
service, again with Singapore Airlines and Air China.
BT and France Telecom are now in the final stages of implementing a
dedicated, land-based pan-European digital service called Jetphone. The
service is due to start in October 1993 and has the support of a number of
European airlines. The system will provide 'the office in the sky', as well
as on-board shopping, car and hotel reservations and in-flight
entertainment.

FT  15 JUL 93 / Letter: Time to make the water polluters pay (2)
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JAMES SKINNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In the debate about the price we must pay for clean water frequent
reference is made to the cost of combating pollution caused by fertilisers
and pesticides. If these costs were charged to farmers, according to the
'polluter pays' principle, it would be one step towards establishing the
true costs of intensive as opposed to extensive farming.
Other external costs incurred by intensive farming include massive
'set-aside' costs; storage and disposal of crop surpluses; unemployment
benefits; soil depletion; high energy consumption etc. If these were charged
to intensive farmers, the true economics of organic farming might become
more apparent, and water bills might rise more gently.

FT  15 JUL 93 / Letter: Time to make the water polluters pay (1)
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr CHRIS SMITH MP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your editorial, 'The value of clean water' (July 14), concludes that
the case of Ofwat, the water regulator, 'demands a political response'.
Quite so. Ofwat's argument is based on the false premise that the costs of
cleaner water must be borne by consumers. This need not be so. The
government should be regulating industries and agriculture more stringently
in order to reduce the amount of pollution discharged into water courses.
Prevention is better - and cheaper - than cure. Instead of this, the
government is deregulating.
When pollution cannot be prevented, the polluter and not the consumer should
pay to remove it from water. This is a principle to which the government
pays lip-service, but fails to implement. It should do so.
The water companies will, of course, have to pay to clean up sewage out of
general revenue. But even this does not necessarily mean that the consumer
needs to be hit hard in the short term in the way that Ofwat predicts. The
current financial regime created at the time of privatisation discourages
water companies from borrowing money for long-term investment. Yet water and
sewerage companies ought to find it easy to borrow for investment at
reasonable rates - their business could hardly be described as high risk.
On a more symbolic level water company executives should perhaps consider
whether it is wise to bleat about the cost of environmental improvements
while continuing to award themselves pay increases of more than 40 per cent
every year.
It is a false dichotomy to posit a choice between clean water and affordable
water. We can and must have both. What is needed is a sensible, non-dogmatic
approach which combines a range of options and instruments, and a
demonstration of firm political will. As you imply, it is now up to the
government to provide this.

FT  15 JUL 93 / Lobbying not worth a button: UK government plans to prune
its contacts with trade associations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The British Button Manufacturers Association was formed in 1915 when the
country's clothing manufacturers were still a force to be reckoned with.
Today, the association shares its headquarters with the Buckinghamshire home
of its secretary, Mrs Patricia Smith.
Its membership has fallen to 14 companies, from about 160 at the end of the
second world war, but it still expects to have occasional meetings with
senior government officials on issues that affect European and world button
markets. Hundreds of other UK trade associations, large and small, have
similar aspirations.
However, Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, wants to
restrict their access, concentrating ministerial and civil servants' time on
a smaller number of 'better resourced, more powerful' lead associations in
each industrial sector. His aim, announced in a recent speech to the
Confederation of British Industry, is to improve the quality of industrial
lobbying in Whitehall and Brussels.
The principal role of trade organisations is to lobby government on
legislation and likely policy changes that could affect the way in which
their member companies operate. Mr Heseltine believes that fewer, larger
groups would be more effective than a myriad of smaller, more narrowly
focused bodies.
The prospect of losing already limited access to government dismays Mrs
Smith, who is contracted by the button makers to work one morning a week -
in practice, it is more - assisting with pay negotiations, dealing with
correspondence, organising meetings and keeping abreast of possible
legislative changes.
She says: 'Recently we became concerned about European Community attempts to
restrict the use of nickel, which affects button making. After much
badgering we got a meeting with Department of Trade officials, but only at a
very low level. We were very disappointed.' The department has raised the
issue in Brussels, but the proposed EC legislation remains unchanged.
By concentrating on the big picture there is a danger that issues affecting
small component suppliers could be ignored, says Mrs Smith. This could have
a detrimental effect on larger manufacturers which rely on small suppliers.
Ministers and government officials say they do not have enough time to see
all the organisations demanding their attention. They add it can be
confusing to receive conflicting messages from trade associations in the
same sector.
There are about 2,000 registered trade associations in Britain, compared
with 1,200 in Germany and 1,000 in France, according to Mr Chris Henderson,
a director of CBD Research, which since 1965 has published a series of
British and European guides to business, trade and professional
organisations.
The formation and survival of so many associations is explained partly by
history: the scale and diversity of Britain's industrial base spawned large
numbers of trade groupings, whose members have traditionally valued their
independence and who have enjoyed the club-like atmosphere of small, focused
organisations.
While industry has declined, the number of associations has remained high.
In the past 25 years, since CBD Research has kept records, the number has
been remarkably constant, says Mr Henderson. Associations in declining
industries that have merged or disappeared have been replaced by new
industry bodies formed in growth areas such as electronics, he says.
But recession in the past few years has eroded individual membership numbers
and trade association income - most fees are based on a member company's
turnover, payroll or capital employed.
Some smaller trade associations, faced with the loss of lobbying access as
well as dwindling income, are seeking loose federations where they can share
resources, while others have merged with larger, more powerful organisations
in the same sector.
Mergers between smaller associations have increased as the industries they
represent have shrunk or rationalised.
An example of the trend is the formation of the British Engineers' Cutting
Tools Association, which represents the combined forces of the
Sheffield-based Milling, Cutter and Tool Bit Association, the Twist Drill
and Reamer Association and the Screw Thread Tool Association. The new body
will remain a member of the 50-year-old Federation of British Engineers'
Tool Manufacturers which helps co-ordinate the industry's lobbying
activities.
The Chemical Industries Association, singled out by Mr Heseltine as 'an
excellent example' of a 'well-resourced lead association', acts as an
umbrella organisation providing substantial lobbying assistance to other
chemical trade associations trying to influence Whitehall and Brussels. It
has an annual fee income of about Pounds 4m - only slightly less than the
combined turnover of all 14 members of the British Button Manufacturers
Association.
Mr John Cox, the association's director-general, says: 'It is not enough
just to respond to upcoming legislation. You have to be in permanent contact
with policymakers so you can influence proposals before they are made. You
have to know which members of parliament, in Westminster and Strasbourg,
have influence and when you can contact them. We have to employ permanent
staff to cope with this work, which smaller associations would not be able
to afford.'
Even large employers and trade bodies are forming links: the Confederation
of British Industry and the Engineering Employers' Federation are examining
ways to 'collaborate more closely to improve the delivery of industry's
message to government'.
But co-operation between groups in Britain tends to be less centralised than
in Germany, for example, where specialist interest groups are more
co-ordinated within central industrial organisations. These provide a
well-organised system of industrial lobbying, says Mr Henderson, as well as
providing services for a range of separate product groups - in a similar
fashion to the Chemical Industries Association.
The success of more centralised groups does not mean that small associations
have no place in representing manufacturers' interests. 'The British system
tends to be more informal,' says Mr Henderson. 'Separate product groups in
the same industry may share the same headquarters and even the same
secretary, but still value their independence. This does not necessarily
make them less effective.
'Associations have a lot of functions. They may help organise specific
industry training, maintain links with educational bodies, assist with pay
negotiations, arrange conferences and generally promote and market their
industry. It would be a pity if these individual services were lost as a
result of member companies moving to more broadly based organisations.'
But Mr Henderson shares Mrs Smith's concern that small but important issues
might slip between the cracks, damaging the interests of small industries
which supply larger manufacturing interests.
It is not the first time that government has tried to rationalise its
relations with industry lobbyists. The 1972 report of the Commission of
Inquiry into Industrial and Commercial Representation under Lord Devlin
similarly criticised duplication and confusion in trade associations
competing in the same industries.
The report said: 'Everybody agrees that there are too many bodies. A
businessman can find himself paying out substantial sums to quite a number
of different bodies without being at all clear what he gets in exchange . .
. He can find himself attending quite a number of different meetings at
which the same subjects are being discussed.'
In the critical area of representation to government, it concluded: 'You can
have competition of services but not competition of voices.'
The commission's report was quietly forgotten and nothing changed. The
Department of Trade and Industry, more than 25 years later, might be more
persistent.
The associations themselves appear to be moving in the right direction. It
will be up to the DTI to ensure that those small but important issues do not
slip through the cracks.

FT  15 JUL 93 / Letter: Government failing to convince on CrossRail
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JEREMY BAYLISS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, To achieve its target of attracting 30 per cent of the funding needed
for CrossRail from the private sector ('Private cash sought for 30 per cent
of CrossRail', July 8), the government has got to give private investors the
confidence they need to commit the very large sums of funding required. The
government is failing to do this at present.
The case for CrossRail is unassailable. Probably the best conceived
transport project to be undertaken in such a complex city setting, it will
reduce congestion, bring environmental benefits and help to guarantee
London's position as the world's leading international business centre.
The government is right to look for input from the private sector.
Governments worldwide are finding that they do not have the funds required
to finance all the public services and infrastructure they would like to
provide. CrossRail is a prime example of a project that would benefit from
the commitment, management and market experience that the private sector can
bring.
If it is to win private sector backing, however, the government must now
give an unequivocal commitment that the project will go ahead as soon as the
legislation is enacted. It must also set out clear guidance on the level of
funding and the sharing of risk.
CrossRail will be a significant test of the feasibility of public/private
sector partnership. The government must show full commitment in pushing it
forward if it is to pave the way for private investment in other
infrastructure projects needed for the 21st century.

ENVIRONMENTAL PROFILES OF EUROPEAN BUSINESS By Dion Vaughan and Craig Mickle
Royal Institute of International Affairs and Earthscan Pounds 15. 107pp
Moments of candour are rare when the environment is on the business agenda.
I experienced one last year when asking the manager of a large UK oil
refinery what benefits he got from investing in green technology. He
answered: 'Absolutely none.'
It made a refreshing change from the platitudes about getting ahead and
doing one's bit for Mother Earth which businessmen feel compelled to utter
on such occasions. But even this direct response was little help in plumbing
the murky depths of business attitudes towards the environment. It is a
subject rich in complexity, laced with emotion, tinged with fear - one where
clear and honest thinking is notable for its scarcity.
This book is an attempt to shine some light through the murk - at least so
far as European business is concerned. It is only partially successful
because the light is frustratingly patchy. But it does pick out the main
features, and it gives readers a reassuring sense that what they are
glimpsing bears some resemblance to the truth.
The frustrating part is the anonymity given to the companies which are the
subject of the book. This, the authors tell us without a trace of irony, was
to allow the interviewees 'to define corporate positions clearly'. In
itself, this tells us a lot about those positions: they are highly sensitive
 -and probably embarrassing as well.
The book is a straight piece of research insofar as its authors, working
under the aegis of the Energy and Environmental Programme of Chatham House,
have collated the responses to questionnaires sent to 55 companies in
France, Germany, Italy, Benelux and the UK, representing the automotive,
metal processing, petrochemical, power generation and steel industries. The
questionnaires asked them how important the environment was, where the
pressures lay, how they dealt with them, where they saw environmental issues
heading, and so on.
The questions boil down to whether companies have any kind of policy on the
environment. The chapter on the auto industry lays out what must be a fairly
widespread view: 'Although all companies consider the environment an
important corporate priority, most clearly consider profitability more
important. Analysis of the responses suggests that few companies have a
strategic plan to generate additional profitability from their environmental
positioning and expenditure.'
In other words, they do not associate the environment with profit-making. In
the steel industry, environment ranked behind profitability, health and
safety, and none of the companies interviewed had a main board director with
sole responsibility for it. However, the survey did find a more advanced (if
that is the right word) attitude in the chemical industry, where companies
'see their role as optimising value added . . . to raw materials through
manufacturing. Environmental management is now a very important input to
this process; polluting wastes are seen as unused resources.' Here, the
environment is forcing companies to make fuller use of their materials.
The chemical industry and the electric utilities emerge from the study as
the sectors most deeply engaged in environmental issues, probably because of
the strength of outside pressures, such as the carbon tax proposal and
concern about acid rain.
But for the utilities, the environment is a damage limitation exercise: the
opportunities to gear up environmental spending are few. By contrast, the
auto industry ought to see the environment as a challenge to respond to
rising emission standards and excise taxes to develop new vehicles. But the
study comments: 'What is surprising, however, is that only some automotive
companies take this view. The rest react to, but do not seek to exploit or
pre-empt, consumer demand for environmentally friendly products which at the
moment appears somewhat artificial.'
Why does business take such a reactive, even passive, stance? The
respondents give a number of reasons: uncertainty about future legislation,
the poor financial returns from environmental investment, and the lack of
strong customer pressure. Notice, though, that these are all extraneous
factors.
Might the explanation also lie in the attitude of business itself? Two
components of that attitude come through clearly. One is a narrow perception
of the environment as a requirement to limit harmful emissions or make safe
products, rather than as a broader concept representing a scale of values.
The other is a lack of conviction that many environmental issues are
genuine; many companies seem to see them as fads embraced by a fickle public
 -and exploited by press and politicians.
These are sweeping statements, of course. They do not apply equally to all
industries, and they only contribute to the way people think. But my candid
oil refinery manager would recognise them straight away.
The green lobby may seize on this study as confirmation of industry's
minimalist approach to the environment. But that is not the real message.
The findings depict businessmen who are primarily - and rightly - concerned
with making a profit within the confines of the law, but who are confused by
the buffeting of environmental pressures. The authors are probably right to
conclude that nothing much will change without clear-sighted legislation,
and a public that is willing to pay premium prices for environmentally
friendly products.

FT  15 JUL 93 / Arts: Spielberg's twin-headed monster - Cinema
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL ANDREWS and STEPHEN AMIDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JURASSIC PARK (PG) Steven Spielberg
BARAKA (PG) Ron Fricke
CHILDREN OF NATURE Fridrik Thor Fridriksson
Here it is and was it worth the wait? When you tell someone you have seen
Jurassic Park, back flies the mach-2 question: 'What's it like?' This never
means what it should mean - 'What does it resemble?' - but 'Is it good/is it
bad/will it scare the screaming daylights out of us?'
Let us take the question at first value. Jurassic Park is like Jaws meets
Westworld. (Steven Spielberg, its director, made the first and Michael
Crichton, its writer, wrote and directed the second). It is like a nightmare
day out at the Natural History Museum. And it is like a Hollywood story
conference where savage, primeval pitches rend the air.
'Let's have the palaeontologist hero and the two kids climb the electrified
fence]' 'Let's have the heroine feel a comforting arm on her shoulder and
then discover it's only an arm]' 'Let's have the velociraptors run amok in
the Visitors Centre kitchen]' 'Let's have Lord Attenborough play the park's
founder with a limp, a Scottish accent and a cherubic smile.' (Result: Sir
Richard resembles Ronnie Corbett gone AWOL in an HG Wells novel).
Yes, but you still want to know: 'What is it like?' Well, it is good, it is
bad, and occasionally it scares the daylights out of us. What is good is the
hi-tech presumption of the film. Crichton's novel was a spinechiller-satire
about an ultimate act of hubris. A theme park packed with prehistoric fauna,
recreated through a far-fetched (but not that far-fetched) union of DIY and
DNA, mutinies against its masters. Drawn to the theme of techno-impudence,
Steven Spielberg makes a movie that is all techno-impudence. Jurassic Park
spreads its banquet of gewgaws, gizmos and breakthrough graphics before us,
condemning previous dinosaur films to cinematic prehistory.
Computer imaging and state-of-art modelwork ensure that when Tyrannosaurus
Rex growls into frame to terrify Dr Sam Neill and the two children he is
escorting on an ill-fated preview tour of the park, the said T. Rex is a
glistening, roaring, tail-thrashing mother of all monsters with no hint of
stop-motion jerk.
In fact no signs anywhere of the old clockwork epilepsy we knew and
half-loved in Gorgo and Godzilla. Not in the 'raptors and iguanadons; nor in
the gentle triceratops tended by 'palaeo-botanist' Laura Dern; nor in the
puff-necked 'spitter' that disposes of the villainous Dennis (Wayne Knight),
a park boffin who runs straight into death while smuggling stolen embryos to
a waiting boat.
But if the monsters have evolved beyond stop-motion, the human characters
are a different story. Stereotypes made to fit a game-plan, they stand about
striking prescribed attitudes and between shots make small adjustments of
gesture to present a fresh facet of the same cliche. The palaeontologist
must spout sandblown wisdom. The Chaos Theory scientist (Jeff Goldblum with
Chaos Theory hair and scat speech-patterns) must burble about things
unravelling. And the lady botanist must rail against sexist notions of
female weakness one moment, scream like Fay Wray the next.
In Jaws Spielberg painted an entire, convincing New England community behind
and around the foreground monster. And in Close Encounters Of The Third Kind
he gave a messianic madness to the hero's love affair with the
cosmic-impossible. But in Jurassic Park the characters are prisoners of a
theme park just like the dinosaurs. Only their theme park is called
Hollywood and their inventor-orchestrator is the box-office.
Lowest-denominator thinking means that each character represents a big,
bland constituency for audience identification, from the all-purpose egghead
sceptic (Goldblum) to the all-purpose damsel in distress mildly fuzzed by
feminism (Dern).
Only the actor saddled with the largest burden of cliches, Lord
Attenborough, almost succeeds in throwing them off. Ever since he vanished
behind a movie camera, fans of Sir Dickie the actor have been crying for him
to come forth again. He is marvellous in Jurassic Park. Hammond, the park's
founder, could have been a melodramatic cipher: a science-tampering
scoundrel out of Fritz Lang by Dr No. But Attenborough gives him a foolish
charm, a sing-song passion, even a wistful pain. (Listen to the pure emotion
he finds in a tinselly speech about his flea-circus past).
Elsewhere, the flimsiness of the people undoes even the ferocity of the
beasts. And Spielberg - the Spielberg of ET rather than Jaws - is not above
making the monsters cuddly when there is a pause in the ravening. For
cuddlification comes with the territory: all those covetable tie-in models,
toys, games, T-shirts, gum-wrappers . . .
A Chaos Theory terror movie may be the promise, but in Jurassic Park
cosiness is always just around the corner. As a lexicogapher friend pointed
out, what you really get when you extract DNA from dinosaurs is the word
'souris.' Jurassic Park is a mouse with pretensions. But such is the power
of hype that no one will notice until - only Dollars 100m to go - it has
become the highest-earning film ever made.
Baraka is a film based upon the problematical notion that cinematic silence
equals importance. Subtitled 'A World Beyond Words,' Ron Fricke's film is a
90-minute non-verbal collage of imagery that attempts to show the
interconnectedness of life on the planet. Starting with a snow monkey dozing
off in a hot spring, Fricke's film quickly goes cosmic, presenting the
viewer with a dizzying array of visual takes of smoldering volcanoes,
surging city crowds, traditional religious ceremonies and clouds pouring
over Himalayan mountaintops.
Occasionally, this method provides memorable sequences, such as the montage
comparing assembly line work throughout the world that ends with the truly
unsettling sight of live chicks tumbling down a stainless steel shoot on the
way to becoming inmates at the egg factory. And when Fricke's 70mm camera
zooms in on small details - an Aboriginal man using a plastic comb to paint
his face, for instance - he comes close to making his point. But the film
eventually collapses under its own portentousness, particularly during a
trip to Auschwitz. At times beautiful and arresting, Baraka is ultimately
little more than a stylised exercise in global channel-hopping.
One of the few countries Fricke does not visit is Iceland. Given the starkly
beautiful landscape of that country on view in Children of Nature, you
cannot help but feel he has missed something. Fridrik Thor Fridriksson's
heartfelt second film details the last days of an elderly widower (Gisli
Halldorsson) who abandons his farm for Reykjavik, only to have his daughter
pack him off to an old folk's home. There, he meets a childhood sweetheart
(Sigridur Hagalin), a proud and beautiful septuagenarian who wants to visit
her birthplace on the island's desolate eastern region before dying. Their
romance rekindles and, equipped with a stolen jeep, they set off across
Iceland, followed by the police.
Writer/director Fridriksson has fashioned a subtle, sometimes moving film
about people who will not go gently into the Arctic night. Lovingly
photographed and well acted, Children of Nature avoids casting the elderly
as cute curmudgeons. However, Fridriksson fails to strike a consistent
emotional tone, moving too abruptly from unrelieved gloom to fantastical
whimsy. And the film's subtitles are replete with enough misspellings to
keep the eye from fully enjoying those bleakly beautiful Icelandic vistas.

FT  15 JUL 93 / Arts: The Mountain Giants - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An initial warning may be in order: The Mountain Giants is more for the head
than the heart and parts of it are obscure even by the standards of
Pirandello. It was the author's last play and was unfinished when he died in
1936, though he left an outline for the final act. The production at the
Cottesloe is a new version by Charles Wood who has written a conclusion that
looks as if it is faithful enough to the original intentions.
The Giants are fascists, yet while there are mentions of Herr Hitler and
Berlin, they are plainly of the Italian, not the German variety, and
therefore less efficient. The Italian giants, like the Germans, go in for
stadiums, not theatres, but they are not really giants at all, 'just trying
to be, hoping to be.' In a lovely Italian line, it is said that they are
simply 'the Giganti family', as one may speak of other Italian dynasties.
In fact, the giants never appear. There is one scene of loud martial music
and the sound of giant feet marching, but they do not reach the stage. The
most they do is send a bureaucrat to represent them.
All that may seem lucid enough in exposition. The trouble is, however, that
it does not emerge until around the middle of the play.
The beginning is much more characteristically Pirandello. One set of peasant
actors, led by the magician, Cotrone, meets another, more professional group
known as the Contessa's company. There are some familiar exchanges about
illusion and reality, then some more mystical scenes about dreams. It is
only gradually that we understand that the professionals are under pressure
from the regime, and that freedom of the imagination is in danger of being
suppressed.
In the second act the threat becomes clear enough, but then there is another
twist. It is not the absent giants who boo the actors' play off the stage,
but the huge audience of workers who 'dig, build and pave' for the giants'
state. By then, all the customary playing with illusion is gone.
The stark conclusion is that, under totalitarianism, individual art cannot
exist: harder to say in the Italy of the 1930s than it is today. The piece
ends, almost as it began, with the Contessa being wheeled off, as she was
first wheeled on, in a cart, possibly dead.
There have been other satirical shafts along the way. The sailors who
support the regime, for example, are presented as a set of dummies in a
child's nursery and only occasionally come to life. Presumably they are
serving only to wear the uniform and are not really dangerous at all except
in their readiness to conform.
Even under William Gaskill's direction, this remains a collector's item:
fascinating to watch, but not an entirely coherent play.
It contains one magnificent performance by an actor who continues to grow in
stature. That is Desmond Barrit as Cotrone. He will be remembered as playing
both twins in the RSC's Comedy of Errors and, more electrically, as the
property developer in The Chinese Wolf at the Bush earlier this year.
Physically large, sometimes he just needs to stand there to impress: when he
speaks he compels attention. As the magician commanding the actors, he is
the one wise man in the play, standing slightly above it all.
The actress who stands out is Sian Thomas as the Contessa, but one cannot
say it is the best part Pirandello wrote.

FT  15 JUL 93 / Arts: Onegin proves a musical masterpiece - Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Royal Opera's new Tchaikovsky production affords, in purely musical
terms, one of the most distinguished performances to be mounted in the house
in many a season. When given by ragbag assortments of singers from here,
there and everywhere, parrotting the so-called original language while
surtitles flash away above their heads, International Opera can be a dismal,
unworthy business. When given as here - by a carefully chosen cast of
principals uttering a language either native to them or communicatively
'lived', and a conductor intuitively alert to every strand of musical drama
 -it can seem the noblest of artistic pursuits, worth battling for even in
the hardest of hard times.
This is an Onegin musically structured to make fully-weighted sense of the
work in a theatre that is, strictly speaking, several sizes too large.
(Tchaikovsky had the work first performed by students at the Moscow
Conservatory.) The bigger the house, the greater the danger of coarsening
and blunting the delicate detail of this most intimately affecting of
operatic tragedies. (Tchaikovsky purposely underlined its divergences from
the forms and manners of Grand Opera by subtitling the work 'Lyric Scenes'.)
The conductor of the new production is Valery Gergiev, fiery young chief of
the Kirov Opera. He is making his Covent Garden debut, and perhaps has still
to find his ease there: on Tuesday the early scenes betrayed passing
imbalances in the choral ensemble. In essence, however, Gergiev's Onegin is
already one of the most impassioned, vivid and spontaneously emotional we
have heard: it is properly scaled for Covent Garden yet not overbearing,
grand with no loss of orchestral and vocal immediacy. The sound is always
beautiful, animated (as it were) from within, shaped along the dramatic
lines with a keenness of perception that marries instinct and iron command.
Gergiev takes chances. The domestic, countryfied atmosphere of the opening
scene, with daughters duetting in the distance and mistress and maid
reminiscing in the foreground, is risked by the slow tempo; likewise M.
Triquet's birthday song, and the moment of relief it provides amid the
gathering tensions of the Larin ball. Accentuation of dance-rhythms is not
at all metrically mechanical; indeed, the conductor's rubato elasticities
may surprise the unwary. But even while I wondered at or where I questioned
the interpretative ideas, I felt the opera's dramatic vitality surging out
into the theatre. This is opera-conducting of rare quality.
Sergey Leiferkus (Onegin), Galina Gorchakova (Tatyana) and the Armenian
Gegam Grigorian (Lensky) are members or associates of Gergiev's Kirov
ensemble. The sense of singers supported from the pit, not merely
accompanied, is another of the performance's special virtues. The baritone,
a house favourite, is at his peak of eloquent, fine-grained artistry. Every
inflection tells. A non-Russian speaker gains the illusion of understanding
every word as it leaves his lips. He never loses the air of breeding that is
Onegin's distinguishing mark; even in disintegration he avoids melodramatic
overstatement.
The soprano, who burst upon London audiences with tidal-wave force in The
Fiery Angel, at the Proms and at Covent Garden, is possibly the most
opulent, lustrously full-toned Tatyana in living memory: again, truly Covent
Garden-sized without being oversized. She does not always shape the lines or
make them perfectly smooth; though physically plausible, she is a
sympathetic rather than an original, inventive actress. What she offers is a
restrained, ravishing account of the role, and in context wonderfully
appropriate.
Grigorian, a small, rotund Lensky with a vibrant, technically free tenor and
a heart-breaking openness of emotional expression, is all feeling - the
over-abundance of happiness in the Act 1 aria, beautifully caught in the
timbre and phrasing (and sustained in the conducting), sends out subtle,
alarming warning signals. It is satisfying to see and hear Louise Winter (a
delightfully spirited Olga), Sarah Walker (Filipyevna) and Gillian Knight
(Mme Larin) keeping pace with such idiomatic artistry; and as Gremin it is
peculiarly moving to see and hear again Nicolai Ghiaurov, no longer a basso
cantante in full flood but a 63-year-old veteran wise, colourful and full of
tender vocal touches.
A triumphant Royal Opera Onegin all round? No: the production - by John Cox
in Timothy O'Brien's designs - is plain to the eye, cautiously tactful,
blandly second-rate. No big mistakes are made (which, when one considers how
easy it is to go wrong in this opera - cf. Howard Davies's recent,
mistake-riddled Onegin staging for Welsh National - is a merciful relief).
Nothing gets in the way of the music. For many ROH patrons this may be
sufficient. With this conductor and cast, it deserves to be. But the
replacement of the old Julia Trevelyan Oman sets and costumes seems
unjustified.
Royal Opera House: in repertory until July 24; production sponsored by The
Drogheda Circle.

Lee Kuan Yew, former leader of Singapore, talks to David Lomax in Business
Matters which also reports on the island's business prospects. In 30 years
it has developed from a ramshackle dockyard into one of the most influential
business centres in the world, but the programme asks whether Lee Kuan Yew's
autocratic habits will be appropriate for a new generation (7.40 BBC2).
Crime Limited would be a healthier programme if the makers would stop
pretending that it was performing some sort of high minded social service
and admitted that it is doing just what all the other ambulance-chasing
series are doing: chasing the ratings. It would be more honest to promote it
in the style of the old evening paper fudge boards: 'Horrible murder: full
details' (8.30 BBC1).
Given that the US did not make war on Iraq because of threats to American
oil supplies (the suggestion was vehemently rejected) but because a
sovereign state had been invaded, how should we explain America's failure
for 40 years to fight a war on behalf of Tibet? Under The Sun reports on the
Chinese occupation (9.30 BBC2).

FT  15 JUL 93 / Arts: Angst in America - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ST GEORGE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At first sight, Marvin's Room offers little to laugh at. It is a drama about
leukaemia written by Scott McPherson, who died of Aids at 33 last year. But
this fine American play, now at the Hampstead Theatre, can be extremely
funny. It also enhances the Theatre's growing expertise in north American
drama.
It tells the story of Bessie, a middle-aged Floridian pushed to the side of
her own life by her father's stroke and her aunt's general malaise. Then
Bessie discovers she has leukaemia; her estranged sister Lee is summoned
from Ohio, with her sons Hank (an institutionalised psychotic) and Charlie
(an intractable nerd), in hopes of a bone marrow transplant. At this point,
the play is poised to become a 1990s chromosome comedy. But the play's
outcome is dislocated and truncated, a botched autopsy. In the end, none of
Bessie's family can donate bone marrow; Marvin, Bessie's father, continues
to twitch in the room at the back of the stage; and the greatest wisdom the
play can offer, in its final lines, is 'There's nothing to be afraid of.'
The early Florida medical scenes are, however, a treat: 'I am going to give
you a local anaesthetic, and I am going to remove some bone marrow from your
hip . . . There may be a crunching sound, but it sounds worse than it is,
OK?' oozes Dr Wally.
Bessie has a seizure during the family trip to Disney World. She comes round
in the Lost Children Hut on a 'baby bear' bed, where she finds a moment of
rare sororal intimacy, and also connects with Hank for the first time.
David Petrarca's direction, wonderfully punctuated by Rob Milburn's pastiche
musical arrangements (played by Cafe Noire), addresses the fact that
McPherson's scenes never complete themselves. They border on the truth,
never reaching it. Intimacies are shared through things, a soda, a
photograph, or Lee offering to style her sister's wig.
Alison Steadman plays Bessie superbly as a model of misapplied devotion
opposite the excellent Phyllis Logan as her hard-as-nails sister Lee. They
have a fine, contrasting rapport, with Steadman slightly frumpy and Logan
slightly tarty but never resorting to stereotypes. Carmel McSharry as the
aunt dosing up on multivitamins and daytime soaps manages to assemble a
character out of the traits written for her. Ian Gelder as Dr Wally is
developing his accomplished playing of Americans, and is a joy to watch.
The play has an unsettling effect, somewhere losing control of itself and
heading into chaos. Its message is a muted version of the 1980s clarion call
'You are where you are because you want to be there.' As Bessie learns the
hopelessness of her own illness, she backs into her father's room to die
with him. Neither has much choice.
Hampstead Theatre, Swiss Cottage, NW3 (071 722 9301).

FT  15 JUL 93 / Arts: Youth and reverence - London Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Like babies to the font, the three severely disabled youths were carried
reverentially to the front of the stage and laid on cushions. They were
dressed in kimonos and greeted with oriental music. Their attendants wafted
Japanese fans over them; the youths stared wide eyed with joy. One screeched
his pleasure. There was nothing patronising about the tableau: it was one of
the most moving examples of reverence for life observed on a stage.
And this was no prefabricated platform in a community arts centre. This was
the Olivier at the National Thetre in London. The participants came from the
Harlow College Community Arts group, which involves more than 30
under-19-year-olds, ranging from the able bodied to the most afflicted. They
were presenting Tower of Dreams, which through music, movement, and
spectacle, makes the case for the disabled to be allowed on to the raft of
life, represented as a fairground carousel.
It was part of the 1993 Lloyds Bank Theatre Challenge, the last such
Challenge. After five years and Pounds 1.2m, this investment in youth
theatre has ended. However, the National is already planning another
programme involving youth and is seeking a sponsor.
A great attraction of the Challenge is that the 10 groups which this year
caught the judge's eye from over 250 entries get the chance to strut for an
hour on the UK's most prestigious stage. The three-night festival lets an
audience see not so much new acting talent as the issues that excite youth.
Rather than take a received text, most of the contributions this year were
devised within the companies.
It is an inspiring experience and one which dispels doubts about the
importance of theatre in education. Of course there is an abundance of
youthful worthiness and idealism on display, but also a great deal of fun.
The level of acting assurance is amazing, almost frighteningly so. At the
opening night on Tuesday the Harlow spectacle contrasted with the
contributions of Redbridge College Performance Art Group and Burnley Youth
Theatre which were both built around issues. There is something galvanising
about plays involving teenagers which are devised and performed by
teenagers: the language is so much more credible than the second-hand
observations of older 'realist' playwrights.
Both works were loosely structured, with ideas running way beyond anything
so obvious as a plot, and they were inevitably a bit didactic. But from
Burnley, along with frighteningly confident performances, there was wit and
good nature and the ability to take a serious issue, contraception, light
heartedly. There was even room for romance, even if did lead to divorce.
Redbridge was an ensemble work, using mime and music to put over the
dispiriting message than men are bastards. Perhaps the girls do not really
believe it; perhaps they have been watching too much television. But it was
enthusiastically performed and had the saddest of endings. Sandy Toksvig,
the evening's presenter, announced that this would be Redbridge's last
performance. It was the victim of local authority spending cuts, an
unwelcome reminder of cruel and blinkered reality on an uplifting evening.
There are three more playlets tonight. Try and get a scarce ticket.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Robin Leigh-Pemberton (pictured right), who stepped down as governor of the
Bank of England last month, has picked up his first outside directorship and
a new title.
The former governor, who was given a life peerage in the Queen's birthday
honours list, took the title Lord Kingsdown yesterday and was also appointed
a director of the Basle-based Bank for International Settlements, the
central bankers' bank.
The appointment was less surprising than the title. The governor of the Bank
of England always sits on the BIS board and the tradition is that the
ex-governor is the second British director. Until yesterday Lord Richardson
of Duntisbourne, head of the Bank of England between 1973 and 1983, had been
the second British director on the BIS board.
The choice of title was less straightforward. The ex-governor has strong
ties with Kent. He has been Lord Lieutenant since 1982. However, although
his home is in Kent, he does not live in either of the county's two
Kingsdowns. Instead he has taken the title of a great, great grandfather,
Thomas Pemberton, a successful lawyer who was made a peer by Queen Victoria,
but died childless.

FT  15 JUL 93 / Technology: High-tech as a country pursuit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's rural areas increased their high-technology employment during the
1980s at the expense of urban centres, according to a study which pours cold
water on notions that high-tech industries in the UK have the potential to
become big employers.
The report by Bernard Fingleton of the Department of Land Economy at
Cambridge University underlines how cities often provide an unsuitable
environment for modern manufacturing. This is partly on the basis that many
companies in this activity employ large numbers of highly paid workers in
scientific disciplines who prefer living in the countryside.
Another factor is that high-tech companies - in sectors including
pharmaceuticals, aerospace, electronics, optical technology and high-value
plastics - often require specialised, low-cost manufacturing and research
buildings which may be hard to find in urban areas.
The report says that only three, predominantly rural, UK regions increased
job numbers in high-tech fields in the 1984-89 period. The areas are Wales,
Yorkshire &amp; Humberside and south-west England.
Other regions, including the conurbations of Greater London and West
Midlands, saw large falls in employment in technology-based industries.
Between 1984 and 1989, numbers employed in this field fell by a greater
amount than in manufacturing as a whole, while total employment, including
services, rose due to the general economic expansion of that period.
High-tech industries in the UK excluding Northern Ireland employed 782,000
people in 1989, 5.3 per cent down on the 826,000 five years earlier. Over
the same period, the numbers in all types of manufacturing fell by 3.9 per
cent, to 5.2m from 5.4m. During the five years, UK employment, generally,
rose by 6.9 per cent.
Behind the fall in high-tech employment is thought to be the large increases
in productivity in these industries during the 1980s. Other factors were
severe international competition and poor innovation in Britain. These
aspects may limit the degree to which high-tech industry can expand in the
UK in the 1990s.
Specific factors pushing down high-tech employment in London and the
south-east may have included the economic overheating of the late 1980s.
This increased labour costs and rents at a particularly high rate in
southern England, forcing expanding companies to move to other parts of
Britain.
Wales was a beneficiary of this process, the study says. Efforts, especially
by the Welsh Development Agency, to attract high-tech companies helped to
increase employment in this field nearly 50 per cent over the period, to
just over 42,000 people.
During the 1980s, other mainly rural parts of Britain increased high-tech
employment, partly because of the attractions to many small companies of
working in the countryside.
Yorkshire and Humberside increased high-tech employment 24 per cent while
the comparable figure for the south-west was 4 per cent.
Greater London and West Midlands suffered a fall in the number of high-tech
jobs of 31.1 per cent and 15.7 per cent respectively.
In spite of a 6.3 per cent fall in employment in high-tech during the period
in south-east England (not including Greater London) this region by the end
of the 1980s continued to account for easily the greatest proportion of
workers in this field.
High-tech employees in the south-east compared with the overall technology
workforce stayed constant at about 28 per cent during the period.
The south-east has for many years had a high proportion of high-tech
employees in its total workforce, partly because of the presence of big
research centres in areas such as drugs, aerospace and electronics.
Ominously, the study says it is difficult to envisage employment in
high-tech industries expanding much in the 1990s. In 1989, this accounted
for only 3.5 per cent of all UK employees and 15 per cent of manufacturing
jobs.
'The location of high-technology manufacturing in Great Britain: Changes in
the late 1980s', Bernard Fingleton, Department of Land Economy, Cambridge
University, 19 Silver Street, Cambridge CB3 9EP.

FT  15 JUL 93 / Technology: Just the ticket for Spielberg
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DELLA BRADSHAW
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The thunder of dinosaur feet in Jurassic Park is likely only to be beaten
this weekend by the thunder of movie-goers' feet as they stampede to cinemas
to see Steven Spielberg's latest blockbuster movie, which is previewed in
the UK this evening.
Those who prefer to turn their backs on this somewhat prehistoric method of
getting a seat can use technology to ensure a place at the front of the
queue.
MGM Cinemas is using a fully automatic ticket booking service for customers
in 34 cinemas in the London and Brighton area, including the Trocadero in
London's cinema land in the west end. A telephone call will enable customers
with credit cards to book a seat at their first choice cinema or at a nearby
venue if that is not available.
And, assures Keith Pullinger, assistant to the general manager at MGM, there
will be enough lines to ensure that every caller gets through. 'I defy
anyone to get their phones answered as quickly as we can.'
The numbers to be called will be advertised in the local press - each of the
34 cinemas has been allocated a different number. Callers hear a recorded
announcement asking questions about the film, day and time. By pressing the
number indicated after the time or film the preference is registered. The
most popular film is always listed first, says Pullinger. 'Seventy-five per
cent of bookings now are for Jurassic Park.'
Once the details, including the credit card number, are determined, the main
computer, which is operated by Computicket, sends them to the cinema
requested using the Paknet radio data network. Confirmation is then sent
back to the computer centre and the tickets printed out in the cinema for
collection. If the caller does not have a modern tone telephone, the system
will switch the caller to a human operator.
According to Pullinger the Computicket service is unique in offering both a
manual and automatic booking service.

FT  15 JUL 93 / People: Davies takes on another chair
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Michael Davies, deputy chairman of TI and a director of British Airways, is
taking over as non-executive chairman of Simon Engineering. Sir Philip
Foreman, who has turned 70, had been serving as interim chairman for the
past three months following the sudden death of the previous chairman Roy
Roberts. He stays on as deputy chairman.
Simon has been hard hit by the recession. At the annual meeting in May, Sir
Philip forecast a loss for the first half of this year and revealed the
company would then be in breach of one of its banking covenants, which
knocked 25 per cent off the value of the shares in a day.
Davies, who would not be drawn on how he will help restore the flagging
fortunes of 'one of the UK's longest established engineering companies' said
that his arrival 'did not necessarily mean anything' as regards the position
of chief executive Brian Kemp, who joined in 1989.
Davies, 59, admits he has recently been spending a good deal of his time at
BA, where all the non-executive directors have been drawn in to the
wranglings over the Virgin 'dirty tricks' affair. But he is adamant that he
has time for another post in addition to the four other chairmanships,
including that of Calor, which he maintains on top of the BA and TI
commitments. 'I enjoy business,' he says, adding only that 'over time I do
change my portfolio'. Those changes are, however, not likely to include BA
in the near future, as this week he was re-elected to the board, on which he
has sat since 1983.

FT  15 JUL 93 / Technology: Making it quickly in metal - A breakthrough in
rapid prototyping
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On the table in front of Richard Fedchenko is a small propeller blade made
of cured polymer. It is a typical product of rapid prototyping - the process
that manufacturers have been using for the past five years to help speed up
their product development.
Next to it is the same blade cast in metal. It might normally have taken
months to produce, but is also a product of rapid prototyping.
Fedchenko is a senior executive at 3D Systems, the California-based company
which dominates the rapid prototyping industry. Last month, 3D launched
QuickCast, a new rapid prototyping and tooling technology that claims to
reduce the lead time on metal castings by 80 per cent.
The launch is a big event for 3D and 'a quantum leap' for rapid prototyping,
says Fedchenko. As such, it could have important business implications for
rapid prototyping as a contributor to concurrent engineering, the umbrella
term for using teamwork and technology to get products onto the market
quicker and to increase competitiveness.
Rapid prototyping is already being used by hundreds of companies worldwide,
including British Aerospace and Mercedes-Benz. It takes any
three-dimensional computer-aided design (Cad) file of a part, converts it
into hundreds of layers and builds the prototype from that.
3D uses a system that traces each layer by directing a laser-generated
ultraviolet light on to the surface of a vat of liquid polymer resin.
Rival companies have different solutions such as 'instant slice curing' from
the Israeli-US supplier Cubital, and laminated object manufacturing from
Helisys in California. Several other companies, mainly US, are working on
their own approaches.
The process has already proved its worth, says Fedchenko. Weeks have been
saved producing prototypes that can be discussed, looked at and handled by
the product development team. The prototype can also be used as a strategic
marketing tool. Logitech, the computer mouse producer, used rapid
prototyping to produce a mouse in 10 days for a meeting with IBM, he says.
But, while manufacturing industry has shown a lot of interest in rapid
prototyping, some potential users have been waiting until it is possible to
produce a metal part by rapid prototyping. Once a cast metal part is
produced, it can be subjected to stress analysis, wind tunnel testing and
other tests necessary before production - none of which can be carried out
on a polymer prototype.
This has become something of a holy grail for the rapid prototyping
industry, because the current method of casting a metal prototype can take
several months. It involves machining hard tooling from metal to produce wax
patterns, which can then be cast using the traditional 'lost wax' process.
Unfortunately this investment casting process - 'investing' the pattern in a
slurry, heating to produce a ceramic mould and burn off the wax, then
pouring molten metal into the mould - does not work with 3D's normal polymer
prototypes. They expand with the heat, cracking the mould.
Fedchenko says 3D has now solved the problem. Its QuickCast process produces
a part with a complex internal triangular gridwork, which allows the part to
collapse into itself during heating, leaving the mould undamaged.
The gridwork reduces the weight of the prototype by two-thirds, leaving a
much smaller residue of ash which can be sucked out of the mould with
compressed air. A new type of epoxy resin, developed by 3D and Ciba-Geigy,
has replaced the acrylate resin used previously. This has increased accuracy
by 100 per cent, says Fedchenko, and produced a much smoother finish that
does not need to be sanded and polished.
The result is a very accurate metal prototype which can be produced some
three to four weeks after a Cad design is completed, compared with an
average of 18-20 weeks using wax patterns.
On more complicated parts, significant sums of money can be saved as well as
time.
At last month's World Conference on Investment Casting in London, 3D was
exhibiting an aero-engine front frame prototype made by a division of
Allied-Signal, which saved Dollars 100,000 (Pounds 67,000) and 44 weeks
using QuickCast. Other rapid prototyping companies are working on producing
metal parts, but 3D's advantage is its installed base of some 350
prototyping machines worldwide. The fastest 3D machines with the biggest
vats could cost as much as Pounds 400,000 in the UK, and 3D is offering
QuickCast as an Pounds 8,000 software add-on, excluding the cost of the new
resin.
But, says Fedchenko, rapid payback is not in itself a sufficient
justification for investing in rapid prototyping. 'You have to have a
compelling need. The message is: does it give you a competitive advantage by
getting you to market quicker?'
Fedchenko believes the world rapid prototyping market could double over the
next two years from Dollars 45m-Dollars 50m because of QuickCast. 3D is
targeting foundries, traditional tool and die shops and rapid prototyping
service bureaux and manufacturing industry from aerospace to medical implant
producers.
And the next stage? 3D is working on adapting its technology to produce the
dies used in injection moulding machines. Further development is required,
says Fedchenko, but 'rapid manufacturing' is on the horizon.

Scotch has become the national drink of Greece, outselling the native ouzo
by 40 per cent. A country of only 3m households and with a struggling
economy, it imported 2.4m cases of mainly bottled-in-Scotland brands, worth
Pounds 78m, last year.
Since 1988, Greece has increased import volumes by 65 per cent and climbed
from 10th to fourth place in the list of the industry's overseas markets.
Growth was stimulated by reductions in the tax on imported spirits in 1987.
After further cuts last year, Greece now has one of the lowest spirits taxes
in Europe - close to a fifth of the UK rate.
Lower prices and increased marketing encouraged a shift in consumer habits,
particularly among young people who began to desert the tavernas for modern
night clubs and bars. In these clubs Scotch has become the favourite tipple,
selling for up to Pounds 60 a bottle, mixed in tall glasses with ice and
water or ice and cola. The opportunity has been seized and exploited most
successfully by United Distillers (UD), the Guinness spirits division.
The old Distillers Company (DCL), taken over by Guinness in 1986, was weakly
placed in the Greek market.
Andrew Morgan, UD's regional director for southern Europe, recalls: 'DCL had
13 brands of Scotch on the market, handled by seven different distributors.
The brands competed against each other as well as against those of our
rivals.'
Cutty Sark, owned by Berry Bros and Rudd, and Ballantine's from Allied-Lyons
were the market leaders. UD's Johnnie Walker Red Label was a poor third;
Dewar's trailed further behind.
Morgan was sent to Greece to sort out the situation. 'The plan was to exert
more clout by segmenting the portfolio and repositioning the brands, to
develop our own local resources and recover profit margins,' he says.
The portfolio was split into complementary halves: one focused on Dewar's,
Bell's and Dimple; the other on Johnnie Walker Red Label and Black Label.
It was decided to position Dewar's as the stylish drink for young people
frequenting bouzouki clubs and bars. Volume sales were small, but the brand
appealed to the young because of its market leadership in the US and because
it was not associated with older drinkers in Greece.
A joint venture, UD Kanellakis, was formed with the Greek distributor,
Nektar, to handle the brand, and a portfolio which also included Bell's and
Dimple, number two to Seagram's Chivas Regal in the deluxe sector, Rebel
Yell bourbon and Tanqueray gin. UD retained strategic marketing control but
used the Nektar sales force.
The Johnnie Walker brands were targeted on the take-home trade and modern
night clubs; given a slightly older, less brash, advertising image than
Dewar's, designed to appeal to the Greek fondness a chat with friends over a
drink.
The take-home trade, with premium Scotch such as Red Label priced at about
Pounds 7 and deluxe Black Label at twice that price, is growing fast. Last
year it accounted for 55 per cent of total whisky sales compared with 30 per
cent in 1988. To handle these brands - together with Gordon's, UD's
best-selling gin - a joint venture was formed with Boutari, the country's
leading wine producer and distributor.
Constantine Boutari has transformed the country's wine industry, improving
quality and developing new brands. As growth slowed, however, the group had
been seeking opportunities to enter other drinks sectors. The partnership -
recently formalised in the creation of UD Boutari and renewed for 20 years -
provided the strategic opening it needed.
Boutari now also imports and distributes Guinness stout and Carlsberg lager,
as well as producing Kronenbourg and Henninger beers under licence.
But the joint venture company, with Ian Meakins, a former member of UD's
European marketing team as managing director, concentrates on the marketing
and sales of UD's spirits and Boutari's wines. Profits go to the brand
owners and costs are shared on a formula based on volume sales. It employs
80 salesmen in the clubs and bars, and supports its advertising with a
stream of promotions.
The two joint ventures have rapidly built UD's strength in the market. Its
brands have grown faster than those of its rivals. In five years, UD Boutari
has tripled sales of Johnnie Walker Red and made it market leader. UD
Kanellakis has increased Dewar's sales tenfold. In the process, UD has more
than doubled the trading profits of its operations in Greece.

FT  15 JUL 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Grocers' guide to
the east
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Material deprivation played its part in the collapse of communist rule in
east and central Europe. So it is not surprising that knowledge of marketing
conditions in these countries is still pretty basic.
But the gap is being plugged by market research. Mintel has published a
report* produced by KAE Development, a specialist in business development in
east Europe, examining various aspects of grocery marketing in the Czech and
Slovak republics, Hungary and Poland, which together form a market of some
65m consumers.
There are some striking east-west differences. While household spending on
food, drink and tobacco is on average 19 per cent of total income across EC
member countries, it is 70 per cent in Poland and 50 per cent in Hungary.
The study also suggests that as much as 25 per cent of spending on groceries
still goes on black-market products.
Other findings useful for western businesses moving into the region include:
high brand awareness of west European goods, but fickle brand loyalty.
'There is no longer such a strong belief that products from western Europe
are superior, in fact there is a local patriotism which western European
companies ignore at their peril.'
The countries concerned have no shortages of consumer goods and 'most
grocery sectors are well covered'.
Promotions, competitions and similar marketing devices are very popular; a
west European coffee company ran a promotion in the Czech republic offering
consumers the chance to win a new car and attracted entries from almost
one-third of the population.

FT  15 JUL 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Diary of a whisky
salesman - Michael Cassell follows J&amp;B's market manager from the Scottish
highlands to the nightclubs of Spain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Brodie of Brodie, 25th laird and master of Castle Brodie, a romantic
monument to Scottish highlands' history, wears the same, weary expression as
his Labrador dog.
His library is crammed with chattering Spaniards; there are some outside the
window suspended under a hot air balloon and others lining up to be measured
for a kilt. Tomorrow, they might throw a haggis.
The Brodie of Brodie, turned 80, has seen it all before. So has Jonathan
Stordy, the adrenalin-fired market manager for J&amp;B whisky who is 50 years
his junior.
Serious business is at stake for Stordy, who has to ensure the Scottish
evening is a hit with his 50 important guests. Back in Spain, after all,
they are at the sharp end of an increasingly cut-throat assault on the local
whisky market by J&amp;B's owner, the Grand Metropolitan subsidiary
International Distillers and Vintners.
IDV is number one in what is its biggest market, each year selling at a
premium price, 2.2m cases of 'smooth, soft aspirational' J&amp;B Rare, along
with much smaller quantities of the deluxe labels J&amp;B Reserve, a blend at
least 15 years old, and Knockando, a Speyside single malt. Stordy and his
colleagues have to fight local whisky producers and rival, international
brands such as Ballantines and Johnny Walker Red Label to sell every bottle.
Mixing it in the marketplace gives the biggest buzz to a man who once
dreamed of becoming a professional golfer and who joined IDV two years ago
after a spell as a Unilever brand manager, promoting shampoo in Ecuador and
washing powder in Egypt. But the ceilidh at Brodie Castle is still a very
important part of his present job.
The morning after the night before Spanish VIPs go to the Knockando
distillery for lectures on whisky-distilling and blending. Stordy, in
impeccable Spanish, shows videos which mix action-packed images of youthful,
sporting prowess with the J&amp;B brand.
He is careful to stress the concept of responsible alcohol consumption. In
Spain - where there are 13 measures to the bottle against 36 in the UK - J&amp;B
customers are told: 'To know how to drink is to know when to stop.' Half of
them already take it with Coca Cola or water and ice.
The Spanish visitors are impressed by the riverside distillery, if a little
alarmed to hear that the equivalent of three and a half bottles of Scotch -
'the angel's share' - evaporate each minute from the large, bonded
warehouses.
Within days of the Scottish visit, Stordy is in Spain to do what he loves
best.
He regards himself, primarily, as 'a champion of J&amp;B's long-term strategy,
closest to the marketplace', acting as a bridge between J&amp;B in Britain and
its Spanish consumers but working closely with Anglo Espanola de
Distribucion (AED), the Madrid-based national marketing company which IDV
acquired in 1990.
Apart from policing the quality of local marketing operations, Stordy's
objectives include tailoring J&amp;B's global strategy on issues such as premium
pricing, presentation and image to match local conditions. He tries to help
Scotland deliver improvements in customer service, speaks regularly to the
40-strong network of Spanish distributors and keeps close tabs on the
competition. It is all, he says, about adding value.
Stordy will not criticise the team in Scotland but is clearly frustrated at
times by their reluctance to accept what they are told by people on the
ground. Knockando, he says, is being outsmarted in the quality gift market
by brands such as Chivas Regal and Cardhu. He is pushing his UK colleagues
to retaliate with better packaging. Images of the Scottish highlands are not
good enough.
His overriding mission is to keep J&amp;B in pole position in Spain, which means
a very traditional drink bearing the royal warrant of no fewer than six
British kings and two queens 'must stay exciting to the young'. 'We must be
number one in the night,' he insists, as he begins a marathon 'on-trade'
tour to bars, nightclubs and discos.
At the Honky Tonk bar Stordy chats with Jose Luis Salto, the 'nightman of
Madrid', who works across the city until dawn ensuring J&amp;B is on show and in
demand.
On to a J&amp;B open-air party at the Boulevard bar where clumsy clowns push the
product. J&amp;B supports 4,500 such parties every year at some of Spain's
300,000 bars, each event graded into A, B and C events, depending on how
many cases each outlet normally sells.
Next stop for Stordy and Javier Barruetabena, AED's sales director, is Joy
Aslava, the top night spot where hundreds dance to music which thumps the
chest while drinking Scotch at Pounds 6 a slug. Stordy is 'pacemaking',
handing out luminous, bottle-shaped lapel badges which create instant
interest. There are, however, too many bottles of Ballantines around for his
liking.
Next day, to the airport, where J&amp;B has its revenge. After 15 meetings,
Barruetabena has finally persuaded the airport bar concessionaire to replace
Ballantines with J&amp;B. Stordy is impressed.
On to Barcelona - which consumes 10 times more bottles of J&amp;B than the
entire UK - for an important meeting with Caprabo, a supermarket and
hypermarket operator ordering 10,000 cases of J&amp;B a year.
The government welcomes hypermarkets because price-cutting helps curb
inflation. Suppliers such as J&amp;B are more cautious, required to remain
competitive but determined not to degrade the quality image. Off-trade sales
are increasingly vital but J&amp;B must keep within the clearly defined price
bands which define its market.
There is a late-night dinner with Vicente Estruga, a large, genial man who
runs local distributor Dicom. More club visits follow and, in one, a
reveller sings the praises of J&amp;B over the bar. He wins a luminous badge.
The night ends early at 3am, with an earnest, pavement conversation about
promotional packs and point of sale material. Stordy is still firing on all
cylinders but finally concedes: 'It's not a party. It's a bullfight.'

FT  15 JUL 93 / Accountancy Column: Developing a strategy for quality
research - Some of the problems faced in remaining flexible in the search
for solutions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN ARNOLD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LATEST four-year strategy from the Research Board of the Institute of
Chartered Accountants in England and Wales unveiled this week, highlights
key questions in the nature of accounting research.
An important purpose of accounting research is to contribute to the solution
of practical problems by enhancing understanding of their causes and
consequences. Such problems may be those faced by accountants - how best to
account for brands, for example - or those caused by accountants or
accounting - like whether current costing techniques result in the best
management decisions.
Expecting all research to produce short and medium-term benefits is to
misunderstand its purposes and potential. Some of the benefits will be
long-term. Others will not accrue to the accountancy profession at all.
So who should fund it? In a capitalist economy, costs will normally be borne
by those who benefit. Research designed to help accountants should generally
be funded by individual firms or by professional bodies.
The funding of research about accountants and accountancy is less clear. If
the regulation of the profession is of interest to society at large, then
the government should support it. But since the UK accountancy profession is
largely self-regulated and wishes to remain so, it might be expected to bear
the cost.
Responsibility for funding will depend also on the focus of the research.
There is little incentive for individual firms or even particular industrial
or professional sectors to fund basic research as the benefits are
long-term, sometimes speculative and widely spread, such as the effects of
the increasing internationalisation of capital markets.
So basic research in accounting is often funded by the government. But
reductions in public sector grants during the past decade raise the
possibility that the accountancy bodies should attempt to make good some of
the deficit, as part of their duty as learned professional bodies.
Applied accounting research normally produces results which are valuable to
the accountancy profession as a whole, such as standard setting, auditing
practices or corporate governance. It is an area where there is an obvious
need for the professional bodies to provide support.
Accounting development, or technical work, such as the development of a
management accounting system for a particular firm, will often provide
benefits which are peculiar to particular organisations or firms. So it is
reasonable to expect those who benefit from the research to fund it.
The new research board strategy document reflects these arguments. The
primary objective is to assist the Institute to fulfil its principal object:
'To advance the theory and practice of accountancy in all its aspects,
including in particular auditing, financial management and taxation'.
In the last four years, the board has invested over Pounds 750,000 in
research, sponsored almost 100 new projects and published 37 books and
monographs. Much has influenced policy making. For example, projects or
publications supported during the past two years which helped the Accounting
Standards Board include goodwill and other intangibles, depreciation, the
accuracy of property valuations, the information content of cash flow
disclosures under FRS 1, reductions in disclosure requirements, segment
reporting, summary financial statements, marking to market, discounting in
financial reporting, accounting for acquisitions and mergers, and the future
shape of financial reports.
Of interest to the Auditing Practices Board have been topics such as the
audit expectations gap, audit committees in large UK companies, the expanded
audit report, the impact of audit regulation, and a survey of auditing in
the UK.
The board's achievements have extended further. Projects have included the
use of accounting information in bank lending decisions, accounting systems
in the context of changing management practice, the hidden costs of tax
compliance, financial risk in capital budgeting, the development of an
environmental research agenda, Housing Association accounting, financial
reporting and management accounting in the regulated industries, and a
project funded jointly with the Economic and Social Research Council on the
extent to which UK and US share prices reflect accounting earnings.
The board has also sponsored three joint projects with the Centre de
Recherche et de Documentation of the Ordre des Experts Comptables, into
comparative French and English treatments of pensions, goodwill and
depreciation, published a book on financial reporting in Japan, and
commissioned a series of 12 books on financial reporting in Europe.
The new strategy document - which offers up to Pounds 275,000 a year - seeks
broadly to continue and develop previous successes. But it differs from its
predecessors in one important respect. The board is interested in high
quality research in all the main areas of the discipline and, in the face of
some opposition from those who believe that it should define a detailed
research agenda, it has decided not to dictate a detailed programme of
priority areas for research.
Such a programme may be unduly inflexible and would quickly become outdated.
The board will continue to seek suggestions from the Accounting Standards
Board, the Auditing Practices Board and relevant institute committees as to
research relevance.
The board will continue with five principal activities:
Sponsoring research projects. Projects may range from a few hundred pounds
to Pounds 50,000 or more. Although there is no detailed programme of
priority areas, the current agenda includes accountability within the
business community and the public sector, the national and international
reform of financial reporting, the role of accounting and auditing in
regulation, the use of accounting information to support management
decision-making, improving environmental accountability and the development
of a fairer and more efficient system of taxation and social security.
Disseminating research findings. The board attaches the greatest importance
to making findings as accessible to as wide an audience as possible, through
books, research monographs and articles in academic and professional
journals.
Organising and sponsoring conferences, seminars and workshops. The board
will continue a programme on major subject areas and on themes which are
multi-disciplinary.
Developing the infrastructure for accounting research. Accounting and
finance is a relatively young discipline in UK universities and it requires
support. Existing help includes the Institute Academic Fellowships Scheme,
which contributes to bridging the difference between academic and commercial
salaries for leading young academics, a database group which collects
information about the range of databases available and their potential uses,
archives for the Accounting Standards Committee and the Auditing Practices
Committee, and sponsoring the British Accounting Association's annual
doctoral colloquium and summer school for younger academics.
Organising specialist groups to advise on particular subject areas.
Currently these offer advice on developing the research base in auditing,
taxation, and international affairs, and identify areas of relevance to the
profession.
The board is entrusted with research funds which are substantial by
accounting standards. It hopes to invest them as productively in the next
four years as it has in the past.

FT  15 JUL 93 / Troubles mount for Tory council
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RESIGNATION of Mr David Weeks as leader of Westminster City Council
comes as the council prepares for what is expected to be a highly critical
report by the district auditor into the housing policies of the council's
previous leader, Dame Shirley Porter.
Mr Weeks's resignation was forced by fellow Conservative councillors
following an accusation by Mr Mervin Montacute, the council's managing
director, that he was using council facilities 'for party political
purposes'.
The district auditor's investigation followed allegations by Labour that the
council had given homeless families temporary accommodation while council
property in marginal wards was left vacant, in an attempt to manipulate the
1990 local election.
The Audit Commission said the investigation, which started in November 1991,
had taken longer than expected because other matters had come to light.
Publication is not expected until October.
The council believes that the resignation of Mr Weeks, who was deputy leader
and chairman of the planning committee under Dame Shirley, marks the end of
the last link with the era of the controversial housing policy. Dame Shirley
resigned her seat on the council earlier this year.
The dispute between Mr Weeks and Mr Montacute culminated in a raid by Mr
Montacute on the offices of Mr Weeks and Mr Andrew Dismore, the leader of
the opposition.
In a letter to Mr Peter Bradley, Labour's deputy leader, Mr Montacute said:
'I had reasonable cause to suspect that council facilities in the leader's
office were being used for party political purposes. Party political
material was found there. The actual use of council facilities was not
great, but the political documents were of significance.'
In a subsequent letter to Mr Dismore, Mr Montacute confirmed that 'some of
the documents were copies of fundraising letters. Only a small number of
inappropriate documents were found. There is no evidence, for example, of a
mass mailing for fundraising purposes.'
Mr Montacute refuses to publish the letters, citing advice from the council
solicitor. He also refuses to answer Labour questions on whether any of the
letters were addressed to the council's own contractors.

FT  15 JUL 93 / Boards face share option pressure: Threat to vote down
schemes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S two leading shareholder bodies have issued guidance to corporate
boards on executive share option schemes aimed at ensuring that top
executives are only rewarded with the schemes if their companies perform
well.
The National Association of Pension Funds and the Association of British
Insurers, whose members between them own more than half the shares of UK
corporations, said schemes which do not meet the guidelines may be voted
down.
The two bodies estimate that the vast majority of existing share option
schemes will come up for re-approval by shareholders in 1994. The guidance
is intended to help shareholders decide which schemes to approve.
The document spells out the criteria to be used when deciding the basis on
which they should be awarded.
The guidance follows an NAPF consultative document earlier this year on
share options which urged companies to avoid awarding shares based on a
company's earnings per share.
It said that earnings per share was a figure that was too volatile and too
easily manipulated by boards. It urged that a company's share price be
required to outperform either an index of similar companies or the broad
stock index as a whole.
However, the ABI, which has long urged companies to use earnings per share
measurements, declined to endorse the consultative document.
The new joint document says that whatever criteria are chosen they 'must not
be capable of manipulation nor must they be influenced by the particular
accounting treatment of various items'. The criteria must be agreed by a
properly-constituted remuneration committee comprised mainly or wholly of
non-executive directors. Full details of the criteria should go to
shareholders.
Mr Geoffrey Lindey, vice-chairman of the NAPF's investment committee, said:
'The first principle is that there should be a commonality of interest
between shareholders and management.' He added that the majority of
corporate respondents to the NAPF's initial consultative document indicated
that they did not believe performance criteria should exist for issuing
share options to executives: 'They felt it was part of their pay.'

FT  15 JUL 93 / MPs condemn lack of research for legal aid reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM KING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government acted in ignorance when it reformed the legal aid system, a
committee of backbench MPs said yesterday.
The Commons public accounts committee expressed concern that the Lord
Chancellor's department did not have enough information about the likely
impact of changes to legal aid introduced on April 1.
In a report published yesterday the committee acknowledges that the Lord
Chancellor's intention in changing eligibility for legal aid was to contain
the rise in spending while targeting aid at those who needed it most.
But the report says that the department's officials 'did not know the number
of adults who would no longer be eligible for support, and were unable to
confirm or reject the worrying estimates that had been made by the legal
profession'. It adds: 'The department had no figures on the likely impact of
their measures on the number of people who represented themselves and on the
extra costs and delays that might be incurred.'
According to the report, neither the department nor the Legal Aid Board had
any information or analysis on why offers of legal aid were not taken up,
even though that could help in forecasting and monitoring legal aid
spending.
In 1991-92, 2.8m people were assisted by legal aid at a cost of Pounds
947.1m, an increase of nearly 40 per cent on the previous year. Spending is
expected to rise to Pounds 1.1bn in 1992-93 and to Pounds 1.5bn in 1995-96.
The MPs argued that whatever the eligibility framework, the biggest
opportunity for saving on legal aid spending was controlling the cost of
cases.
Court cases are now much more costly in real terms than 10 years ago, the
report says. The MPs urge more control over the assessment and payment of
the costs of court cases and action 'to eliminate additional costs arising
from delays and shortcomings within the systems of civil and criminal
justice'.
In his annual report on the court service, also published yesterday, Lord
Mackay, the Lord Chancellor, says that his department's priority will be to
control legal aid costs and spending on the courts while maintaining
standards of service.

FT  15 JUL 93 / Big rise in total declared bankrupt

<TEXT>
THE NUMBER of bankruptcy petitions issued in the High Court and county
courts in England and Wales increased by 33 per cent to 46,333 last year.
The rise followed a jump of 56 per cent between 1990 and 1991.
Judicial statistics published by the Lord Chancellor's Department yesterday
also showed that the level of mortgage repossessions fell by 24 per cent to
142,191 last year after peaking in 1991 at 186,649.
Warrants issued to recover land fell by 7 per cent to 124,211.
The statistics also showed that in the criminal division of the Court of
Appeal there were 669 appeals against conviction, of which 285 were allowed.
Of the 1,488 appeals against sentence, 900 were allowed and 49 allowed in
part.
The attorney-general made 24 referrals where it was thought a sentence was
unduly lenient. In 20 cases the sentence was increased.
The average waiting time for defendants remanded in custody and committed
for trial at crown court rose from 10 weeks in 1991 to 11.1 weeks.
But the statistics show some success in shifting the burden of work from the
upper courts. The number of cases committed to the crown court for trial
fell from 104,754 to 100,994, a fall of 3.6 per cent.
The Lord Chancellor's Department attributes this fall to the greater use of
cautioning by police and to magistrates dealing with a greater proportion of
cases.
Reforms made in July 1991 to move work from the High Court to the county
courts led to a 27 per cent fall in the number of actions issued by the
Queen's Bench Division.
The number of cases dealt with by arbitration during the year rose by 30 per
cent to 80,332.

FT  15 JUL 93 / Birt launches counter-attack on BBC 'snipers'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN BIRT, the BBC director-general, yesterday launched a counter-attack
against his critics, describing them as traditionalists, opportunists,
society's hecklers and old BBC soldiers 'sniping at us with their muskets'.
The riposte, which included an unprecedented attack on the past inefficiency
of the BBC, came the day after Mr Mark Tully, the BBC's veteran India
correspondent, had attacked what he called the atmosphere of fear and
sycophancy in the corporation.
Mr Birt told the Radio Academy Festival in Birmingham yesterday that the BBC
had been 'an unwieldy, almost soviet-style command economy' where money was
allocated from the top down to every activity.
Programme makers needed the skills 'of supplicants at some Byzantine court',
and a lack of adequate financial information and control had permeated the
whole organisation, he said.
He set out examples of waste and inefficiency: A new radio studio used for 3
per cent of the time.
A graphics suite used for one full day a fortnight.
A large programme-making area spending Pounds 200m a year without a single
accountant to track expenditure.
A tendency for every department to invest in its own expensive facilities
and staff whether necessary or not.
Overheads of Pounds 300m a year.
Mr Birt argued: 'Millions of pounds were wasted through the years, frittered
away on over-provisioned overheads, and equipment lying idle. Waste is money
that should have been spent on programmes.'
Since 1990, Mr Birt added, Pounds 180m had been saved and savings now
running at around Pounds 100m a year were being ploughed into programmes.
He told the festival that there was no choice but Producer Choice, the
system introduced in April that allows full costing of programmes and gives
producers the right to buy services on the open market.
Mr Birt conceded that modifications were necessary - a smaller number of
business units inside the BBC and block contracts to reduce the number of
individual transactions between them.
Mr Birt appealed to his critics to face realities rather than looking back
with nostalgia.

FT  15 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Rightwing Tories urge spending cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RIGHTWING Tory MPs last night presented proposals for 'vigorous' cuts in
public spending to Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, and warned that income
tax increases would 'betray all that the party stood for'.
Further curbs on public spending should also take priority over another
extension of indirect taxes such as value added tax, the steering committee
of the 92 Group of Conservative MPs said in a report given to Mr Clarke.
Its proposals include a moratorium on recruitment to the Civil Service and
government agencies, and cuts in spending on defence procurement and the M25
link-road programme.
Some 92 Group members went further, suggesting an immediate 5 per cent cut
in the public-sector workforce, excluding doctors, nurses, teachers and the
police.
Although many of the steering group's proposals would prove controversial
even among the Tory right wing, the list of demands highlights the political
difficulties facing Mr Clarke if taxes were increased to control public
borrowing.
Mr Clarke met the 92 group, which is supported by about 100 Conservative MPs
and is chaired by Sir George Gardiner, Tory MP for Reigate, as part of
extensive consultations he is holding within the party ahead of the autumn
Budget.
Ministers' claims that the targets set for public spending in the next
financial year are tight were dismissed by the group. It said there is no
need for the 4 per cent increase in cash terms envisaged.
Other targets for a fresh review of spending include the overseas aid
budget. 'It is ridiculous to be borrowing from one set of foreigners to give
to another set of foreigners,' the submission said.

CASES of 'mad cow disease' confirmed in Britain have risen above 100,000,
the government admitted yesterday.
Mr Nicholas Soames, a junior agriculture minister, said more than 7,000 of

number of suspect cases of bovine spongiform encephalopathy now being
reported was less than at the same time last year.

FT  15 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Papers detail espionage deals
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
DOCUMENTS published today by the Public Record Office show that Queen
Victoria's ministers employed correspondents of the Reuters news agency as
government intelligence gatherers.
The papers - released with the approval of Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign
secretary, as part of the government's drive towards greater openness -
indicate that the then prime minister Lord Salisbury cancelled the
four-year, Pounds 500-a-year contract for 'confidential reports' in 1898.
According to the Foreign Office, the papers detail expenditure on espionage
financed by parliament in the years following the French revolution.

FT  15 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Labour plan for British SEC body
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A LABOUR government would set up a full-blown British Securities and
Exchange Commission with comprehensive supervisory and enforcement powers, a
front-bench spokesman said yesterday, David Owen writes.
Under a blueprint set out by trade and industry spokesman Mr Stuart Bell,
the new body would swallow the much-criticised Serious Fraud Office, which
would become its enforcement arm and take over fraud, regulatory and
supervisory work from the DTI.
Mr Bell said the British SEC would be a statutory authority with powers over
retail banking, building societies, insurance, accountancy, pension funds
and the Lloyd's insurance market.
Mr Bell's speech to Oxford University's business summer school appeared to
open a rift over City regulation between Labour's Treasury and trade and
industry teams. Less than two months ago front-bench Treasury spokesman Mr
Alistair Darling said he did not advocate the 'importation' of a US-style
SEC.

FT  15 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Government heading for climbdown
over adoption
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT was yesterday heading for a climbdown over its plans to
charge couples for adopting children, after both Downing Street and Mrs
Virginia Bottomley, the health secretary, poured cold water on the idea.
The controversial proposals - that were to have been set out in a white
paper on adoption law from the Department of Health - sparked a public
outcry last week.
Mr John Bowis, the health minister who outlined the plans, was charged with
creating a 'cash-register society' after he disclosed that councils would be
given the power to impose fees of up to Pounds 1,500 for social workers'
reports to assess the suitability of prospective parents.
Yesterday Mrs Bottomley appeared to overrule Mr Bowis when she said she very
much doubted whether there was 'any prospect of any type of charging for
domestic adoptions'.
There was 'no question' of financial matters standing in the way of
adoption, she said. It was clear that adoption was a 'very sensitive'
subject.
Her position was supported by Downing Street, which said it did not believe
local authorities should be charging people in a manner that would exclude
good parents.
It was 'unlikely' there would be much charging, Downing Street said,
confirming it was 'looking at' the white paper in conjunction with the
health department.
Labour last night welcomed the government U-turn, describing charging for
adoption as 'one of the Tories' crazier notions'.
Mr David Blunkett, shadow health secretary, said: 'We should be encouraging,
not discouraging, good parents to come forward.'

THE House of Lords needs radical reform to make parliament more effective
and revitalise the democratic process, according to the Institute for Public
Policy Research, the centre-left think-tank, John Willman writes.
The institute says today that there is an essential role for a second
chamber in sharing the legislative burden and scrutinising the government,
but the Lords lacks the legitimacy to function effectively. The institute
proposes a 300-member second chamber with 270 members elected in regional
constituencies by proportional representation.

FT  15 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Thatcher rebuffed in massive
referendum vote
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BARONESS Thatcher, the former prime minister, saw her demand for a
referendum on the Maastricht Treaty rejected by a massive 269 majority
(445-176) last night when peers struggled through the division lobbies in
what government business managers hailed as the biggest vote ever recorded
in the House of Lords.
Peers travelled from all quarters of the globe to attend the debate and some
who are rarely seen at Westminster joined in the laughter and cheers when
Lord Thomson of Monifieth (Liberal Democrat) welcomed 'so many strange and
fresh faces'.
Lady Thatcher was the central figure in a strongly argued debate, the
outcome of which was never in doubt, in spite of her call to override
government objections by voting for a referendum because it was 'the
people's turn to speak'.
Both Conservative and Labour peers were subject to a three-line whip against
the referendum, while the Liberal Democrats were accorded a free vote.
In a powerful speech, Lady Thatcher brushed aside warnings from some of her
former cabinet colleagues that by backing a referendum, peers would endanger
the government and risk a constitutional clash with the Commons.
She maintained that it was 'not a matter of confidence in the government'
because all the political parties were divided over the treaty.
Government supporters nodded with approval when Lord Rawlinson of Ewell (C),
a former attorney-general, suggested that Lady Thatcher was as embittered as
Sir Edward Heath over being toppled from the leadership of the Tory party.
He urged peers 'not to be used by those engaging in a political vendetta to
destroy the government and the prime minister'.
Lady Thatcher again insisted that the treaty would lead to the diminution of
the authority of the British parliament and courts.
The people should be allowed to speak, she declared, because the powers
belonged to them while parliament's role was that of custodian.
Before her speech Lady Thatcher sat for three hours impassively making notes
as she was subjected to concentrated criticism from Tory peers who had
worked closely with her in government.
Lord Howe, the former foreign secretary and chancellor whose resignation
speech in the Commons triggered her departure from 10 Downing Street in
1990, recalled that occasion by again resorting to a cricketing metaphor.
Ridiculing suggestions that by voting for a referendum the Lords would act
as a 'long stop', he said it would be like gathering up the ball when it was
almost out of the ground.
Viscount Whitelaw, one of Lady Thatcher's most influential confidants when
he served as deputy prime minister, told peers that by supporting a
referendum they would be seen to be seeking to usurp the 'leading role' of
the Commons.
In a notable maiden speech, Lord Lawson, the former chancellor, opposed a
referendum on the treaty, but accepted that it would be an appropriate
device to use if a future government sought to commit Britain to a single
European currency and a single central bank.
He said: 'Unless and until that time arrives - and for a number of reasons I
rather doubt it ever will - I do not believe that the case for a referendum
is made'.
Lord Blake (C), who moved the referendum amendment to the Maastricht Bill,
said there was a strong moral case for letting the people have their say. He
insisted: 'The British people have a right to be consulted so they can
endorse, or otherwise, a measure which irrevocably and irreversibly affects
their governance.'

FT  15 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Smith claims breakthrough in union
links battle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS and DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN SMITH, the Labour party leader, yesterday claimed a 'breakthrough'
in the first round of his battle with the unions over their links with the
party by striking a deal on sweeping reform proposals.
Yet the initial reaction of some of the main union leaders was negative. Mr
John Edmonds, leader of the GMB general union, said: 'There has been some
movement and that is encouraging, but we are still not able to support Mr
Smith's proposals for the selection of local candidates.'
A spokesman for the shopworkers union USDAW said last night: 'It is a small
step forward but we are clear that unless there is some union element in any
formula our delegates could not accept it.'
Last night, Mr Edmonds faced bitter criticism from Labour MPs at a private
meeting in Westminster after again backing the principle of unionists voting
collectively in leadership elections and in the selection of MPs.
Mr Smith had expressed delight when an internal review group of union
representatives and Labour MPs backed changes in line with his own thinking
on the selection of Labour candidates, the election of future leaders and on
ending union 'block votes' at party conferences.
The Labour leader attended the meeting and afterwards a spokesman said: 'The
chemistry is beginning to work.'
Mr Smith's confrontation with union bosses over the principle of
one-member-one-vote has turned into a test of his leadership. But he still
faces a struggle to win approval for the proposals on selecting candidates.
The agreement goes to Labour's National Executive Committee on Monday. A
summer of attrition between the Labour leadership and the union movement is
likely before the party conference.
The review group's report was agreed without a vote when representatives of
the GMB and TGWU general unions, the most vocal opponents of
one-member-one-vote, apparently decided not to try to block the plan.
The group backed Mr Smith's insistence that only full Labour party members
should vote in the selection of parliamentary candidates. Under a so-called
'levy-plus' system, Labour-supporting trade unionists would also have to pay
a reduced membership fee, in addition to the political levy, to become
members.

FT  15 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Maastricht showdown brought forward
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR last night brought forward a crucial Commons debate on the
Maastricht treaty as ministers began a last-ditch campaign to persuade Tory
Euro-sceptics to abandon their efforts to wreck the treaty.
Ministers said that the debate on Britain's opt-out from the treaty's social
provisions would be held next Thursday, four days earlier than originally
planned.
The decision - which will be endorsed by the cabinet this morning - is
designed to put as much time as possible between a threatened defeat on the
social chapter and the Christchurch by-election the following Thursday.
But it comes amid private warnings that whatever the outcome of the debate
the government now has little prospect of avoiding a humiliating rout at
Christchurch.
The air of desperation in the Tory campaign was underlined by a warning from
a senior minister yesterday that defeat could hasten the next general
election - and the possibility of a Labour government.
Mr Peter Brooke, heritage secretary, later clarified his remarks, insisting
that the Tories would win both the by-election and the next general
election. But his apparent gaffe reflected deep pessimism in the government
about its prospects in Christchurch.
Ministers are predicting privately that the 23,000 Tory majority in the once
rock-solid seat could be replaced by a Liberal Democrat majority of upwards
of 10,000.
The Commons debate will come after the Maastricht Bill has received the
royal assent early next week.
Hard-line Tory Euro-sceptics plan to vote with Labour and Liberal Democrat
MPs for a motion which would call on the government not to ratify formally
the treaty unless it abandons the social chapter opt-out.
The cabinet has been told that a victory for the Labour amendment would not
have legal force and the government could press ahead regardless with
ratification. But Mr Major is aware that rejection by MPs of the social
chapter opt-out would represent another damaging blow to his personal
authority.
Ministers have been told not to speak publicly about the government's
tactics in the event of such a defeat. But the Tory rebels are to be told
privately that they will not prevent ratification by voting with the
opposition.
At present about a dozen Tory Euro-sceptics are threatening to defy Mr
Major, but Tory party managers are courting assiduously the support of
Ulster Unionist MPs.

FT  15 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Labour prepares blueprint for
statutory British SEC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A LABOUR government would set up a full-blown British Securities and
Exchange Commission with comprehensive supervisory and enforcement powers,
the party said yesterday.
Under a blueprint set out by Mr Stuart Bell, a trade and industry spokesman,
the new body would swallow the much-criticised Serious Fraud Office, which
would become its enforcement arm and take over fraud, regulatory and
supervisory work from the Department of Trade and Industry.
Mr Bell said that the SEC would be a statutory authority with powers over
retail banking, building societies, insurance, corporate governance,
accountancy, pension funds and the Lloyd's insurance market.
Labour would also overhaul insolvency laws, introducing US-style
chapter-eleven procedures to give companies in difficulty a 'better chance
of survival'.
Mr Bell's speech to the Oxford University business summer school appeared to
open a rift over City regulation between Labour's Treasury and trade and
industry teams.
Less than two months ago Mr Alistair Darling, a front bench Treasury
spokesman, said he did not advocate the 'importation' of a US-style SEC.
Mr Bell said Labour would 'build upon' the recent Large report on 'improving
the efficacy of financial regulation' to provide greater openness,
cost-effectiveness and public accountability. He promised Labour would
'consult widely' with the City.
Anticipating criticism of Labour's suggested approach, Mr Bell argued that
statutory regulation was 'no more time-consuming or expensive than
self-regulation'.

FT  15 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Labour presses Scottish campaign
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR yesterday demanded an independent review of the government's plans
for redrawing the local government map of Scotland.
The Opposition launched a debate on a motion accusing the government of
'blatant manipulation of boundaries for narrow party interests'.
Scottish secretary Mr Ian Lang rejected allegations of gerrymandering and
accused Labour of 'scaremongering' about the effect of his proposals on
jobs.

FT  15 JUL 93 / Business optimism rising in Scotland
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SCOTTISH business optimism is higher than at any time since late 1990,
according to yesterday's quarterly survey published by the Fraser of
Allander Institute and six chambers of commerce.
The institute - the economic research body at Strathclyde University in
Glasgow - found business confidence had risen across the board, even in the
construction industry. It also found rising demand for personal loans.
Demand had risen 'significantly' in manufacturing and retailing, but had
fallen in construction. A 'moderate' rise in the wholesale and tourism
sectors was noted in the survey.
Investment plans were stepped up in manufacturing, distribution and tourism,
but had been reduced in the construction and oil industries.
The survey also found that while jobs continued to be shed in all sectors -
apart from tourism and leisure - the rate of decline was slowing down.
Pay rises, however, continued to fall in construction and the wholesale,
retail and finance sectors, but rose in the manufacturing and tourism
industries.
In all sectors except manufacturing pay rises stood at 4 per cent or less.

FT  15 JUL 93 / Bifu to ballot on strike at Lloyds
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BIFU, the banking union, is balloting its 12,000 members at Lloyds Bank this
week on a series of one-day strikes over pay, Diane Summers writes.
The union is protesting at the ending of cost-of-living increases and the
introduction of performance pay. The ballot will close at the end of August.
The 22,300 members of the Lloyds Group Union have been balloted on the same
issue - the result is expected in the next few days.
Lloyds management said that although there had been no cost-of-living
increase, performance awards to the 48,000 staff this year had added 3.4 per
cent to salaries on average. Employees had also received an average 4.1 per
cent through profit-sharing.

FT  15 JUL 93 / Many jobs are 'filled by word of mouth'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEARLY half of all job vacancies in Britain are filled through informal
'word of mouth' contact, according to Mr Mike Fogden, chief executive of the
Employment Service, the agency which runs government Jobcentres.
Mr Fogden said that between 40 per cent and 45 per cent of jobs are filled
by informal contacts. The agency, which he has run since 1987, accounts for
about 30 per cent of placements, with the rest covered by classified
advertising and private agencies.
He said that as many as 25 per cent of the workforce may have experienced
unemployment between April 1990 when joblessness started rising and February
this year when it fell. The total number of new claimants of unemployment
benefit since April 1990 is 13.2m - but that includes many people who have
been counted more than once.
Mr Fogden said that the broader geographical and occupational spread of
unemployment in the recession 'may have been a factor in the early fall in
the jobless figure'. In the recession of the early 1980s the jobless were
concentrated in declining industrial regions far from where jobs were being
created, while in the latest recession the jobless have been closer to new
jobs, he explained.
However, Mr Fogden warned that the proportion of people out of work for more
than one year will rise to about 40 per cent of the jobless total from the
current figure of just over 30 per cent. Currently, said Mr Fogden, about 25
per cent of all the unemployed are back to work within one month and
two-thirds are back within six months.
Jobcentres deal with only about 20 per cent of vacancies in the London
region, but up to 80 per cent in parts of northern England.
The centres concentrate on finding jobs for semi-skilled and skilled manual
workers and clerical staff. They deal only rarely with employees earning
more than Pounds 25,000 per year. Mr Fogden said that about 70 per cent of
his staff deal with benefits and 30 per cent with job placement.
The Employment Service's market share of job placements has risen slightly
during the recession.
The service has been widely praised in recent years for an improvement in
image and performance. Yet critics say that it has simply found ways to push
more people off the unemployment register.

FT  15 JUL 93 / Hunt launches 27 work-creation schemes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR DAVID HUNT, the employment secretary, yesterday announced the formation
of 27 local projects aimed at creating jobs and helping the long-term
jobless.
The projects, announced on the eve of publication of the latest unemployment
figures, are the result of a call by the government for the 82 Training and
Enterprise Councils (Tecs) to generate ideas to tackle local problems. An
extra Pounds 25m was made available in the last Budget for the scheme,
called Tec Challenge.
Tecs administer the government's main training programmes for the unemployed
and try to create jobs that are suitable for their areas - such as offering
tailor-made training for companies wishing to take on recruits.
While funding for the projects is finite, the Department of Employment may
select some of them for general use should they be particularly successful.
Mr Hunt said yesterday: 'I hope that some of the best schemes generated by
Tec Challenge will come to be standard practice for many Tecs in future.'
Ideas include:
A grant of up to Pounds 75 a week for 20 weeks from Aztec, the
Kingston-upon-Thames Tec, to allow people to build up a portfolio of
part-time jobs.
A Calderdale and Kirklees Tec plan for business start-ups based on
developing new products and focused upon unemployed graduates, particularly
engineers, and those with management skills.
A Kent Tec project to help smaller companies expand and recruit unemployed
people - with help including a recruitment subsidy.
Merseyside Tec will offer a recruitment package for employers, linked to
customised training.
For the past four months unemployment has gone down - with various theories
put forward to explain the unexpected trend.
A report published today by the Employment Policy Institute, an independent
think-tank, says there is little evidence to support controversial claims
that unemployment has fallen as a result of an 'administrative fiddle' by
the Department of Employment.
The report says that the timing of the fall is probably best explained by
employers 'over sacking' last year - leading to a period of 'employment
readjustment' over the past few months - combined with a reduction in the
number of people in the labour market.
The report concludes that there is some faint ground for optimism, but it
remains possible that unemployment will start to rise again in the next few
months. Whatever happens, it seems unlikely that predictions of unemployment
peaking well in excess of 3m, will be fulfilled.

FT  15 JUL 93 / Summer sales help cut inflation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN UNUSUALLY early start to the summer sales helped push the inflation rate
down to 1.2 per cent - its lowest level for nearly three decades.
The retail prices index dropped 0.1 per cent in June to 141.0.
The Central Statistical Office said price cuts were most pronounced in
household goods, clothing and footwear.
Sale offers on a range of furniture and electrical appliances caused a 0.6
per cent month-on-month fall in the price of household goods. Clothing and
footwear prices registered the sharpest June fall since 1952 at 0.9 per
cent.
Most vegetables were cheaper, and plentiful supplies of fresh fruit helped
keep price rises at bay. Seasonal food prices dropped 4.6 per cent on the
previous month, the sharpest June fall since 1987.
Special offers on aftershave, condoms and spectacles pushed the price index
for personal goods and services down. Prices fell by 0.3 per cent compared
with the previous month.
Reductions in the cost of local cheap-rate telephone calls caused a 0.8 per
cent drop in the prices of household services in June.
Price increases for second-hand cars and petrol have moved against the
downward trend, with sharper increases than a year ago. Motoring costs rose
1.1 per cent over the month, and were 4.7 per cent higher than a year ago.
Mortgage rates held steady compared with a small fall in June last year.
The last time inflation was 1.2 per cent was in February 1964. It was last
lower in July 1963 when prices rose by 0.8 per cent year-on-year.
International comparisons show that only Denmark and the Irish Republic have
lower inflation rates than the UK. It is lower than the EC average of 3.3
per cent and the G7 average of 2.7 per cent.
The bringing forward of the summer sales to June may mean that the inflation
figures for July will be less encouraging, since prices will be compared
against extremely sharp reductions in July last year. British
Telecommunications' special offer on cheap-rate local calls also ends in
July.
Nonetheless, prices for seasonal food usually fall sharply in July and
continuing summer sales will help keep down prices for clothing, footwear
and household goods.
Most economists are confident that underlying inflation will remain within
the government's target range of between 1 per cent and 4 per cent for the
rest of this year. Underlying inflation - the RPI excluding mortgage
interest payments - was 2.8 per cent in the year to June, unchanged on the
previous month.

FT  15 JUL 93 / Bankrupt petitions up 33% last year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM KING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NUMBER of bankruptcy petitions issued in the High Court and county
courts in England and Wales increased by 33 per cent to 46,333 last year.
The rise followed a jump of 56 per cent between 1990 and 1991.
But judicial statistics published by the Lord Chancellor's department
yesterday showed that the level of mortgage-repossessions fell by 24 per
cent to 142,191 last year after peaking in 1991 at 186,649.
Warrants issued to recover land fell by 7 per cent to 124,211.
The statistics also showed that in the criminal division of the Court of
Appeal there were 669 appeals against conviction, of which 285 were allowed.
Of the 1,488 appeals against sentence, 900 were allowed and 49 allowed in
part.
The attorney general made 24 referrals where it was thought a sentence was
unduly lenient. In 20 cases the sentence was increased.
The average waiting time for defendants remanded in custody and committed
for trial at Crown Court rose from 10 weeks in 1991 to 11.1 weeks.
But the statistics show some success in shifting the burden of work from the
upper courts. The number of cases committed to the Crown Court for trial
fell from 104,754 to 100,994, a fall of 3.6 per cent.
The Lord Chancellor's department attributes this fall to the greater use of
cautioning by the police and to magistrates dealing with a greater
proportion of cases.
Reforms made in July 1991 to move work from the High Court to the county
courts led to a 27 per cent fall in the number of actions issued by the
Queen's Bench Division.
The number of cases dealt with by arbitration during the year rose by 30 per
cent to 80,332, after the limit for automatic reference to arbitration was
increased from Pounds 500 to Pounds 1,000.

THE GPMU print union and the British Print Industry Federation yesterday
clashed over the results of this year's company-by-company bargaining which
followed the breakdown of national pay bargaining earlier this year.
The GPMU said 1,334 companies - about 60 per cent of the total - had agreed
to the union's minimum terms of a Pounds 6.50 rise in weekly pay on the
skilled rate, an increase of about 4 per cent.
The federation said two-thirds of the 858 companies it surveyed had paid
below the union claim and 235 had enforced pay freezes.
It says the average settlement is 1.9 per cent.

FT  15 JUL 93 / European Court rules on equal pay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ADVOCATE general of the European Court of Justice yesterday said that
employers must justify any differences in pay between groups of men and
women doing jobs of equal value, even if the differences result from
collective agreements which do not appear to be discriminatory, Diane
Summers writes.
The advocate general's opinion, which will influence a ruling expected from
the court in the next few months, relates to a British equal pay case that
has been running for eight years.
Dr Pamela Enderby, a senior grade speech therapist with Frenchay Health
Authority in Bristol, is claiming comparability with a senior grade
pharmacist.
Speech therapists in the National Health Service are generally women, while
70 per cent of pharmacists in higher grades are men. Speech therapists may
earn only 60 per cent of the salary of pharmacists.

FT  15 JUL 93 / Credit details costly
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
CONFIDENTIAL computer data do not come cheap.
The Financial Times yesterday anonymously rang three detective agencies to
ask prices for details of individual bank records and credit card details -
information the Data Protection Act requires banks to keep confidential.
At one, the top rate was Pounds 500 plus VAT for account and credit card
details. At the second, a simple search into a current account cost Pounds
250-Pounds 300 so long as the account-holder's name, address, and account
numbers were provided. The third, registered with the National Association
of Private Investigators, charged Pounds 300 plus VAT and needed a fortnight
to deliver.
Mr John Lamidey, assistant data protection registrar, said private tracing
agents bribe staff to obtain data or internal codes used to authenticate
inquiries. He said they place small advertisements in evening papers
inviting staff of utilities or financial services companies to make extra
money.
Mr Geoffrey Cooke, deputy director of the British Bankers Association, said:
'It's not a matter of hacking. Dishonesty and duplicity is involved.'
The banks have some way to go. Mr Lamidey said only two out of 10 banks he
has visited - Abbey National and TSB - will not disclose any account details
over the telephone.
Barclays Bank insists its safeguards against unauthorised disclosure are
sufficient. Requests for account details come from other branches or
customers. A Barclays employee has to quote a password which is changed up
to three times a day. Even then, information is not given out immediately.
If a call comes from a customer, the bank will disclose information only if
the caller's identify can be verified.

FT  15 JUL 93 / Whitehall calls for training improvements
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON, Industrial Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HUMAN resources and training are the chief obstacles to industrial
competitiveness, a government study has found. Whitehall officials told MPs
yesterday that the main difference between the UK and its competitors lies
at the craft and technician level, while management quality is also
variable.
The report says that productivity in manufacturing still lags behind Japan,
France and Germany by 25 per cent. However, the gap has closed from between
40 per cent and 45 per cent at the end of the 1970s.
Mr Robert Dobbie, head of the recently formed competitiveness division at
the Department of Trade and Industry, told the Commons trade and industry
committee that the gap was largely due to the use of human resources rather
than lack of investment.
The UK's lower spending on research and development was a source of concern,
he said. However, innovation depended not only on research, but on the
successful exploitation of new ideas.
The report on UK manufacturing competitiveness, submitted by the DTI to the
committee, is a summary of a study submitted to ministers earlier this year.
Press reports at the time alleged that the study had been suppressed because
it was too damning about UK industry. This was denied yesterday by officials
who said the new version contained the same data and omitted only
confidential advice to ministers.
Mr Tim Sainsbury, industry minister, said the report showed that although
British industry had caught up significantly in the past 15 years, there
were still gaps. 'In the training of technicians and craftsmen, the results
are perhaps worse than we expected,' he said. 'In other areas they were
better.'
Mr Dobbie told MPs that British management was also variable in quality. The
best were of world class, but there was a long tail of poorer performers. He
denied MPs' suggestions that UK manufacturers were at a disadvantage on
fiscal grounds: 'The fiscal regime in the UK is relatively favourable
towards industry.'
He also denied that UK companies were handicapped by shareholder pressure
for large dividend payments. 'The evidence is that in general, UK companies
do not get into difficulties by paying too large dividends,' he said.

FT  15 JUL 93 / Council tendering gives 'average saving of 6.5%'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMPULSORY competitive tendering by local authorities in England has yielded
an average cut in costs of 6.5 per cent, research by the Department of the
Environment shows.
Mr Tony Baldry, the environment minister, told a seminar at Oxford
University that the main findings, to be published next week by the
University of Birmingham's Institute of Local Government, 'proved the
success of CCT so far'.
The department said the findings mean the average authority had made savings
of Pounds 500,000.
Mr Baldry said: 'Where they existed, inefficient working practices have been
exposed and tackled. CCT prompted authorities to review services and
standards - sometimes for the first time.'
The figures are similar to those of the Audit Commission, published in
March, which estimated a reduction of 7 per cent in the cost of contracted
services.
The research by Birmingham University is less optimistic than that produced
last week by Dr Stefan Szymanski of the London Business School. He found
that competitive tendering produced an average cost saving for
refuse-collection contracts of 27 per cent.
Birmingham's research covers all blue-collar services - including building
cleaning, street cleaning, catering, ground maintenance, vehicle-fleet
management, and sport and leisure management as well as refuse collection.
It includes the administrative costs of managing the contracts, unlike Mr
Szymanski's research.
Mr Keiron Walsh, who wrote the Birmingham report, said savings varied widely
between different types of authorities and between services. Refuse
collection had seen some of the greatest savings.
He suggested that the savings could not be explained by technological
improvements, such as the introduction of wheel-bins for refuse collection,
because in all cases the comparison was made between the years immediately
before and immediately after the contracting out of services.

FT  15 JUL 93 / Agencies exploit the secrets of 20m borrowers: The trade in
credit references
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER and RACHEL JOHNSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ASSERTION yesterday by Mr Eric Howe, the data protection registrar, that
there is 'an established market' in personal financial information is on the
face of it hardly controversial.
Any applicant for a store credit card faces the disclosure of large amounts
of personal data on the payment of just Pounds 1.41 by the store. This is
the sum Infolink, one of the two largest credit reference agencies, charges
its 10,000 users to examine a person's address, history of bankruptcy or
arrears, and an array of information on how he or she has paid off other
loans.
Mr Howe's fiercest strictures yesterday were reserved for the apparent
loophole in the law that allows a person holding the right codes to fool
bank staff into disclosing account details.
But this market is overshadowed by a larger and legitimate one - the market
in credit references of about 20m borrowers, which is estimated to involve
100m inquiries a year. The market's buyers are banks and retail outlets
offering credit - the sellers are the credit reference agencies.
Tracing agents who specialise in debt collection and other private inquiries
can also subscribe to this data. But the agencies insist that only those
with appropriate licences can obtain financial data in addition to the
standard public records such as county court judgments.
The agencies - the largest are Infolink, CCN and Equifax - offer tiered
access to data, and charge different amounts depending on the data
disclosed:
Infolink charges 53p per record for a check on 'black data' held against a
person, including court judgments and bankrupcy rulings that indicate that a
person is a very poor credit risk. This will also allow a check on whether
the right address has been given.
For Pounds 1.41, a user approved to receive credit data will get additional
'white data' on how the individual has handled other financial contracts.
This will not include information such as bank account details and payment
records unless the user has access to 'closed' data.
Subscribers who have agreed to supply information such as payment records
for their own credit card will receive detailed information from other
subscribers' records.
Mr Kevin Still, Infolink head of marketing, insists that the company
constantly refines security to avoid hackers, or users gaining access to
more data than they are allowed. 'By definition, any data system has to be
very careful about unauthorised access,' he says.
But the way credit reference agencies operate, and the use of customer data
held by banks has led to a number of concerns. Two of these were raised
yesterday by Mr Howe in his report, and are likely to remain controversial
as banks review their code of practice for personal customers.
First, Mr Howe questioned whether banks could legitimately supply 'white
data' on how customers operate their accounts to credit reference agencies.
Smaller banks such as Co-operative Bank supply such information in order to
gain access to the closed 'user groups' in which sensitive data is held.
Barclaycard has announced its intention to supply 'white data' to credit
agencies about customers who give consent on application forms. Mr Howe says
the argument that this is a legitimate exchange deal 'may be difficult to
sustain' under the banking code.
Mr Geoffrey Cooke, deputy director of the British Bankers' Association, says
such disclosure 'accords with the code as it stands, but we are happy to
discuss it'.
Second, Mr Howe expressed concern about credit card numbers and bank account
numbers being held by credit agencies on an individual's file.
Mr Still says the possibility of misuse has already been eliminated by the
credit agencies. Those with access to files which hold information about
credit cards or bank accounts are only given basic details, without relevant
numbers.
No matter how secure and well-regulated are credit agencies' methods, the
concerns raised by Mr Howe are likely to recur. And consumers may question
whether there is a clear distinction between the black market trade in
financial data, and the lawful trade done by agencies.

FT  15 JUL 93 / Dare Wigan: racing writer: Obituary
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
DARE WIGAN, who has died in hospital following a stroke, wrote a daily
racing column for the Financial Times and was a notably successful racehorse
breeder. He was 76.
His racing column appeared for 11 years from the mid-1960s, and he
contributed to The Observer, Country Life and other publications. In the
second world war he served with the Coldstream Guards. He was a gentle man,
always courteous and modest.
In racing and horse-breeding circles he was known for the West Blagdon Stud
in Cranborne, Dorset, which he ran with his wife Dawn. Although small,
averaging only four breeding mares, the stud produced a stream of winners
from its foundation mare, Pelting.
Pelting had 14 foals. Twelve appeared on the racecourse and all were
winners. West Blagdon Stud achieved the top foal price at the leading
Newmarket bloodstock sales on five occasions, an outstanding performance for
a small enterprise.
Wigan left four children, one of whom, Dominic, took over his father's FT
column for a number of years. Another, James, is a bloodstock agent.

FT  15 JUL 93 / Names reverse Norman conquest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FEUDAL TITLES, some of which date back to the Domesday Book, have become the
latest assets to be auctioned off by distressed Lloyd's Names to help them
stave off financial difficulties.
'It's like the Norman conquest only in reverse,' said Mr Robert Smith, of
London-based Manorial Auctioneers, who specialises in the area. 'The
Anglo-Saxons are getting their own back.' Mr Smith said his firm has sold
more than 200 Norman titles in the first six months of the year.
'It's a very painless way of raising a bit of cash,' said Mr Smith, who
added that at least 100 Names - the individuals whose assets support the
insurance market - have sold their titles this year alone. 'They are trying
to stave off the evil day. A lot are bankrupt and don't know it.'
One Name who sold recently was the Earl of Carlisle, who raised Pounds
55,000 by selling his barony of Gilsland in Cumbria to an American.
The titles are among more than 13,000 which date back to the Domesday Book.
Titles like the Lordship of Aisby, in Lincolnshire, the Baron of Teerraghin,
in County Sligo, and the head of the Fief of Craqueville, in Jersey, have
long since lost their rights to large estates, although they sometimes have
access to mineral rights.
Even so, British and US businessmen are prepared to pay many thousands of
pounds for the social cachet conferred on barons, earls, viscounts and
marquesses.
'They become the most recent link in a chain of owners going back centuries
and they like the feeling,' said Mr Smith. 'Some actively replace the old
families in the local firmament.'
Mr Smith is marketing 70 titles including the Lordship of Shrewsbury's Fee
in Isleham, Cambridgeshire - a snip at Pounds 5,500 - and the Lordship of
Bermondsey in London - a more expensive Pounds 35,000.
The Barony of Eye in East Anglia is the costliest on offer at Pounds 85,000.
These are useful sums for Names, who have been hit by cumulative losses of
more than Pounds 5bn in the past three years. Names have also been
contributing to a surge in the antiques market, with increased business at
auction houses as heirlooms are sold.
But few Names have been forced to sell their properties. Mr Patrick Ramsay,
of estate agent, Knight Frank and Rutley, which specialises in country house
sales, said that relatively few country houses had come on to the market.

FT  15 JUL 93 / Golden Mile is tarnished
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   LONDON, BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BLACKPOOL'S Golden Mile, which is preparing for the holiday season, reacted
with outrage yesterday to the European Court of Justice ruling that its
beaches do not meet environmental regulations.
Mr John Donovan, secretary of the 1,300-strong Blackpool Hotel and Guest
House Association, which caters for many of the 15m visitors a year, said:
'The reason people don't go into the sea is because it is too cold, not
because it is dirty.'
The court said that nearby Southport also fell below European Community
standards, but the European Commission withdrew its complaint against Formby
Point. Yesterday's ruling carries no financial penalty, but the UK has been
ordered to pay costs.
The EC bathing waters directive, agreed in 1975, requires countries to meet
specified standards within 10 years. The court rejected the government's
argument that the timetable should apply from the date when a stretch of
coastline was designated a place 'where people bathe in large numbers', not
from the date of the directive. The UK, which designated only 27 beaches,
now has 455 on the list, with Blackpool added in 1987.
The government dismissed the ruling as largely 'technical'. Mr Tim Yeo,
environment minister, said: 'The commission has accepted we are doing
everything possible to bring these bathing waters up to standard as soon as
practicable.'
The water industry was spending some Pounds 2bn to ensure that 'virtually
all' waters met the directive by 1995, he added.
According to government figures, recent investment has brought '79 per cent
of (UK bathing) waters within compliance in 1992 compared with 56 per cent
in 1987'. This still makes the UK the second dirtiest country in the EC
league table, ahead only of Germany which has 76 per cent compliance.
All other countries report more than 90 per cent compliance, but the
Commission acknowledges 'problems with the comparability' of the data.
North West Water, the water and sewerage company which supplies Blackpool,
said yesterday that 'planning wrangles' had delayed modernisation.
'Everybody wants the beaches cleaned up but not everybody wants treatment
works on the doorstep,' it said. In the next three years it will spend some
Pounds 400m on the north-west coastline, including Pounds 150m at Blackpool.
