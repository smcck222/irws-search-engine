FT  15 JUL 93 / Gainsborough sells for Pounds 1m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE OF Gainsborough's earliest and most charming portraits, of friends in
his native Suffolk, has been acquired by the Tate Gallery in partnership
with Gainsborough's House in Sudbury.
The London dealer Hazlitt, Gooden &amp; Fox, bidding on behalf of the museums,
paid Pounds 1,079,500, at the bottom of the estimate, at Sotheby's
yesterday.
The National Heritage Fund and the National Arts Collections Fund
contributed most of the funding for the painting, which will be shared
between the two museums.
The Tate has no comparable painting by Gainsborough of this period - the
mid-1750s - when the artist was in his early twenties.
The Gainsborough was the highlight of an auction of British paintings which
brought in Pounds 2.8m. More than a third of the lots on offer were unsold.
A portrait of Sir Charles Watson, painted in Rome by Pompeo Batoni when the
young English aristocrat was on the Grand Tour, comfortably beat its
estimate at Pounds 463,500.
Christie's held a successful auction of early English silver which totalled
Pounds 1.4m and was 89 per cent sold by value. An Elizabeth I silver gilt
cup and cover with an ostrich-egg base sold for Pounds 353,500 to the London
dealer Tessiers. Its upper estimate had been Pounds 250,000.
An even earlier item, the Malmesbury Cup, dated to 1529, just made its low
estimate, selling for Pounds 254,500.

FT  15 JUL 93 / World Trade News: Italian export insurance for review -
Tighter guidelines will follow corruption charges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN A little-noticed move, the Italian Treasury has decided to carry out a
thorough review of the operations of Sace, the state-run export insurance
agency with total exposure of L52,266bn (Pounds 22.25bn).
The outcome is likely to have a profound impact on the way Italian exports
are given cover. In future Sace - or its replacement - will operate on much
tighter guidelines with more overtly financial criteria and less subject to
the strong-arm of the politicians.
Sace has operated with a great degree of discretion and has been deeply
beholden to political masters. This has been exposed in recent months by its
involvement in the corruption scandals that have led in turn to a complete
overhaul of the agency's board.
Mr Roberto Ruberti, head of Sace, is still in jail after being arrested on
March 11 on charges of corruption. Two other senior Sace executives were
arrested, along with three other figures linked to the export credit
business. Mr Ruberti, a former member of the Bank of Italy, is alleged to
have received payment in return for providing Sace cover for overseas
Italian contracting operations.
These developments prompted the Treasury to move in and take a closer look
at Sace, while also guaranteeing the normality of the agency's operations.
Rome magistrates are understood to be examining a series of suspect
insurance deals, especially in the Caribbean, between 1983-88. Some Dollars
300m-Dollars 400m (Pounds 200m-Pounds 270m) is involved.
Until the magistrates have clarified matters, the Treasury cannot approve
formal settlement of the suspect operations. As a result the Treasury is
expected to establish an escrow account to assure creditors they will be
paid.
Even without the damage caused by being caught up in the corruption
scandals, Sace was in need of a reappraisal. Questions have been building up
for years about how far the Treasury should be funding indemnity payments
and over the slim size of premiums. There have also been demands for a
better definition of the types of country risk available for Sace cover, as
well as new guidelines on the agency's role in backing overseas aid
projects. The latter area is where some of the worst abuses are believed to
have occurred.
The Treasury has handed out over L3,360bn in the past two years to assist
Sace pay-out indemnity claims and L1,400bn more is likely this year. The
level of indemnities is believed to have peaked in 1992, the large recent
amounts reflecting problems dating back to 1983-90. These losses relate
primarily to the Latin American debt crisis, exposure in Egypt and problems
arising from political change in east Europe - notably the former Soviet
Union, ex-Yugoslavia and Poland.
The need for such Treasury support stems more from low premiums than from
the income received from credits recovered. Since Sace was established in
1977 premiums have slipped from covering over 80 per cent of indemnities to
under 10 per cent. The ratio of recoveries to indemnities is over 60 per
cent.
Since 1990 tighter methods of control have been in operation; but only now
are the authorities recognising that Sace has conducted insurance cover on
far too discretionary a basis. Thus one of the main tasks of the commission
will be to provide a set of ground rules for transparent operations judging
risk both by country and by business sector.
A more sensitive issue concerns future Sace policy towards covering
investments regarded as strategic in risk countries. This is especially
important for Italy, which depends almost wholly on energy imports whose
cost has to be offset by an aggressive export policy. Successive governments
have thus encouraged big trade and project finance deals with the energy
suppliers. The most notable examples are trade and investment deals to
offset the cost of Algerian and Soviet gas.
Between them, Algeria and the former Soviet states account for L15,000bn
(split in roughly equal parts) of Sace's cover - nearly 30 per cent of all
long-term commitments. Much of the L7,000bn Sace cover for Algeria embraces
trade and investment related to building a second under-the-Mediterranean
gas pipeline. Nevertheless, at present these countries would not necessarily
come within the ambit of stricter criteria for Sace coverage - either in
terms of political risk or because of non-payment of debts.
The Treasury commission will therefore have to decide whether such strategic
investments are determined by reasons of state or by purely commercial
considerations. If the former, then cover will have to be arranged in a
different way - for instance, guaranteed direct by the Treasury or backed by
special collateral.
A pointer is the current negotiations between ENI, the state oil concern,
and Gazprom for a Dollars 1.8bn contract to modernise and upgrade the
Russian federation's gas pipe network. Here the Italians want a commodity
collateral in gas or oil. Only when the collateral has been finalised will
the Sace cover of Dollars 1.6bn be forthcoming.

<TEXT>
MECKLENBURG-West Pomerania, the most rural and thinly populated of the new
east German Lander (states), is seeking foreign private investment in the
water, sewage, housing and tourist industries, said Mr Berndt Seite, its
prime minister, Peter Norman writes.
Visiting the UK, Mr Seite said seven British companies were interested in
investing in the state, including companies in the building material and
food sectors. He said it could take 20 years before the state caught up with
western Germany's standard of living. But it could offer a wide range of
financial inducements to potential investors and had good contacts with
industry in former communist countries.

FT  15 JUL 93 / World Trade News: Japan cautious on surplus cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN's current account surplus is unlikely to be reduced in the next two
years despite last week's agreement with the US that there should be a
significant cut, a senior Japanese government official warned yesterday.
Mr Sozaburo Okamatsu, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry's
vice-minister for international affairs, said the surplus would probably
only start to fall in three years' time and the pace of change would depend
on the state of the world economy as much as the strength of Japanese
domestic demand. He confirmed the Japanese government was discussing
policies which would allow it to meet its commitment to pursue strong and
sustainable domestic demand.
Miti officials believe it could take up to five years for the surplus to be
significantly reduced, as the agreement demands.
Mr Okamatsu, the senior Miti official involved in negotiating a trade talks
framework with the US, said the agreement did not sanction the use of
numerical targets to open up Japanese markets to imports. The 'objective
criteria' referred to in the framework to measure progress in opening
markets would only be used to assess past progress and not set goals.
'We only agreed to use data from the past, not data which could be used as a
target for the future,' he said.
The use of numerical targets to guide Japanese policy had been the most
contentious issue in talks over the framework, which culminated in an
agreement last Saturday.
The US had been pressing Japan to accept the goal of halving the current
account surplus - expected to be about Dollars 150bn (Pounds 100bn) this
year - to 1-2 per cent of gross national product.
Instead, the agreement commits Tokyo to 'achieve a highly significant
reduction in the surplus over the medium term'. Mr Okamatsu defined the
medium term as about five years.

FT  15 JUL 93 / World Trade News: Geneva reclaims Gatt talks
</HEADLINE>

   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE 116 countries involved in the Uruguay Round of global trade
liberalisation yesterday launched two weeks of intensive negotiations in
Geneva aimed at laying foundations for a successful agreement by the end of
the year.
Talks will focus on tariff cuts in manufactures and farm products, and
opening markets to trade in services.
This is the first time in six months that multilateral negotiation toward
the long-delayed agreement has been engaged. For much of the past two years
most negotiators have been hapless spectators to bilateral wrangling between
the US and the European Community, and more recently between the 'quad'
countries, which include Japan and Canada.
Mr Peter Sutherland, the new director-general of the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade, which is overseeing the negotiations, called yesterday on
participants to table significant market-opening offers. 'We can't allow the
process to drift aimlessly. We simply don't have the time,' he said after
briefing negotiators on the breakthrough achieved at the Group of Seven
summit in Tokyo last week.
He hailed the tariff-cutting agreement as 'not comprehensive, but a good
package which allowed us to say there had been a very positive result'. It
was already clear the overall Uruguay Round package should achieve tariff
cuts 'well in excess' of its one-third target.
Mr Sutherland has called a further meeting of the Trade Negotiations
Committee - the principal body overseeing the Uruguay Round negotiations -
in two weeks. He will then examine progress, and 'point fingers at the poor
performers' if necessary.
A further TNC meeting will be called late in August to 'set a critical path'
for negotiations through autumn. The target is to complete an agreement in
principle by December 15, when the US administration's fast-track authority
runs out.

FT  15 JUL 93 / World Trade News: Brussels wants US treaties modified -
Commission seeks to be sole trade negotiator
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Commission has asked seven member states to modify bilateral
friendship treaties with the US, in a move aimed at restoring its authority
as sole trade negotiator of the EC.
The Commission's proposal is a further challenge to the informal US-German
'non-aggression pact' in which each side agreed to exempt the other from
trade sanctions in the US-EC dispute over public procurement.
Germany has come under renewed pressure to implement EC trade sanctions
against the US in the transatlantic row over government telecommunications
contracts.
Germany maintains that a 1954 trade treaty with the US prevents application
of Article 29 of the EC's Utilities Directive which establishes a preference
for EC companies on procurement contracts.
So far, Bonn has refrained from exchanging letters to confirm the deal with
Washington. The Commission's latest move may inflame matters; but Sir Leon
Brittan, the EC commissioner responsible for external economic relations, is
ready to take Germany to the European Court of Justice if necessary,
according to EC officials.
The Commission has proposed that Belgium, Denmark, Germany, Ireland, Italy,
Luxembourg and the Netherlands give one year's notice to the US that they
intend to modify bilateral friendship, commerce and navigation treaties to
accommodate Article 29.
Only Germany considers itself exempt from Article 29, because its treaty
with the US predates the Treaty of Rome. Commission officials said they were
taking a hard line, in case member states with similar treaties further
undermine the EC's united trade policy.
On the Uruguay Round Gatt negotiations, Sir Leon assured the European
Parliament yesterday that television broadcasts, films and other audio
visual products needed special treatment.
Mr Willy Claes, Belgian foreign minister, said the EC should not be the
'victim of a naive and free trade liberalism'.
But Mr Claes made clear he was not in a hurry to reach agreement on
proposals which would make it easier for the Commission to impose
anti-dumping measures. This issue has divided the EC between
protectionist-minded countries and free traders. Mr Claes said it would be
better to wait until after an outline agreement in the newly-resumed Gatt
trade talks in Geneva.
Japanese officials have agreed that Japan's car exports to the EC this year
should be lowered further from the earlier agreed levels, to take into
account the fall in EC demand, a European Commission source said yesterday.

FT  15 JUL 93 / Italy shocked by demand to recall general
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM

<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE ITALIAN government yesterday reacted with a mixture of astonishment and
wounded pride at the demand by the United Nations for the recall of General
Bruno Loi, commander of Italy's 2,400-strong contingent in Somalia.
The call for the general's withdrawal promised to set Italy on its most
public diplomatic row with its major allies in recent years. In parliament
there were demands for an immediate response and further questions about the
possible recall of the entire Italian peacekeeping force in Somalia.
Mr Beniamino Andreatta, the foreign minister, said he was 'astounded' by the
behaviour of Mr Kofi Annan, the official in charge of all UN peacekeeping
operations, who demanded the removal of Gen Loi in a New York press
conference.
The foreign minister indicated Mr Annan spoke in direct contradiction to an
understanding agreed with Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN
secretary-general. Mr Andreatta told parliament he had discussed the
position of Gen Loi in a telephone conversation with Mr Boutros Ghali on
Tuesday.
He said it was clear the UN secretary-general wanted to bring forward the
rotation of Gen Loi, and they had both talked about this being done in
August. This would then give the Italian government time to study the
situation, Mr Andreatta told parliament.
However, the Ciampi government was last night being forced to choose between
obliging the UN and the US, the main power behind the peacekeeping operation
in Somalia, and closing ranks behind Gen Loi and behind the increasingly
divergent Italian view of how to handle matters in the former colony.
On Tuesday, the government indicated that Italian forces should be withdrawn
from Mogadishu, the Somali capital. This was to avoid being seen as an
'occupation force'.
The Italian authorities insist that the operation in Somalia has lost sight
of its original humanitarian and peacekeeping mission. At the same time the
Italian troops are not fully equipped for combat roles in peace enforcement.
Gen Loi was quoted as saying: 'I am perfectly at ease with my conscience. I
have acted according to the spirit and letter of the UN mission.'
In private, there is some admission from officials that Gen Loi may not have
acted in consultation with the UN command, Unisom. But they also point out
the Americans themselves have consulted little.
The Italian government is also sensitive to international criticism of the
role of its troops since this is their first combat mission since the second
world war. So far three Italian soldiers have been killed and more than 20
wounded.

<TEXT>
GENERAL Konstantin Kobets, the Russian deputy defence minister, yesterday
demanded the right to use 'all possible force', including aircraft and
rockets, in the escalating conflict on the border between the former Soviet
republic of Tajikistan and Afghanistan, writes John Lloyd in Moscow.
Gen Kobets' call, which comes three years after Russian troops pulled out of
Afghanistan, followed an attack on a border post manned by a joint unit of
Russian and Tajik interior troops which left 20 Russians dead. The Tajik
foreign ministry said a village eight miles from the border with Afghanistan
was destroyed and between 100 and 200 Tajiks killed.
In a second appearance before the parliament after it had postponed a
decision on legalising the actions of Russian troops in Tajikistan, Gen
Kobets said 'the twelfth border post fell today - I cannot guarantee that
the thirteenth will hold. The way in to Tajikistan lies open.'
Gen Pavel Grachev, defence minister, told the official Itar-Tass agency that
extra units of the Russian 201st division stationed in Tajikistan would be
sent to the Afghan border.
Refugees from the civil strife which devastated parts of the republic last
year are massed in camps within Afghanistan, which now function as bases for
trans-border guerrilla actions supported by Afghan mujahideen. The Tajik
government, formed by forces supported by the former Communists, invited
Russian troops earlier this year to assist in guarding the borders.

FT  15 JUL 93 / Japanese Elections: Japanese 'madonnas' sing rival tunes -
Robert Thomson watches the top two female candidates square off in the
election campaign
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the cloying drizzle of a Japanese wet season, a white plastic grocery bag
tied around the cast on a broken foot, Ms Yuriko Koike, star of television
and the Japan New party, hobbled forth to deliver one more speech in praise
of a JNP-backed candidate.
'If I was paid by the hour for this sort of stuff, I'd be a very rich
woman,' said Ms Koike, confident enough of voter support in her home
prefecture of Hyogo to give time to other candidates hopeful that a bit of
Koike charisma will rub off on their campaigns.
But, before next Sunday's general election, Ms Koike cannot afford to
venture too far from Hyogo, in western Japan, where she is engaged in
symbolic battle with Ms Takako Doi, the 'iron butterfly' and former head of
the Japan Socialist party, now known as the Social Democratic party.
The local media have dubbed the Koike-Doi bout the 'madonna showdown'. Ms
Doi was supposed to lead Japanese politics and women into a new era, but the
expectations have shifted to Ms Koike, whose past life as a television
commentator has given her the off-camera confidence to keep a political
gathering amused.
There are 70 women candidates, up from 66 in the 1990 poll and 35 in 1986,
and it is pure coincidence that Hyogo is home to the two best known. The
'madonna boom' was an important theme during the last campaign, although
only 12 of the 512 members elected in 1990 were women, and the Japanese
media have moved on to other subjects.
Hyogo has another symbol of the need for change: Mr Kenzaburo Hara, 86,
running for the Liberal Democratic party for the nineteenth time, and the
country's oldest candidate. He was politely advised by the party to make way
for a younger candidate, but insisted that 'this is the most important
campaign of my life'.
The congenial Mr Hara, who sees himself as a crusader against 'confusion',
is bewildered by more than just the plethora of new parties. Arriving for a
speech at the Matozaki Gumi construction company, he was carefully guided
into the building where construction workers, the LDP faithful, were to hear
his faltering speech.
Matozaki has Mr Hara's posters plastered on the office walls and presumes
another win will be good for business. The campaign posters show a
strong-boned man, apparently in his late 50s, but the reality is that Mr
Hara, hands and forehead freckled with age, has been unable to defy nature.
Some LDP candidates are wary of being seen as too close to the construction
industry, accused of illegal funding of politicians and bid-rigging. But Mr
Hara is comfortable in the company of his friends at Matozaki, where the
corporate slogan is 'More, most'.
'What will happen to Japan if the LDP does not win? If opposition parties
form a coalition government, they will not be able to agree with each other
because their policies are so different. It will be chaotic for the
country,' said Mr Hara, who still has a sense of the issues and a
politician's handshake.
If an opposition coalition is formed, much will depend on Ms Doi and Ms
Koike, who is second-in-command at the JNP. In Hyogo No. 2 constituency,
where they are competing, there are seven candidates and five seats. It
appears that both will be elected, while Mr Hara may be defeated, though 35
per cent of Japanese voters are still 'don't knows'.
For Ms Doi, winning more votes than Ms Koike is a matter of honour, as is
rousing support for the SDP, which is expected to have its tally of seats
cut from 140 to less than 100. Voters are unhappy with the LDP but now have
a wider choice in casting a protest vote, which has generally gone to the
SDP in the past.
After arriving in the 'Takako-mobile', a van festooned with slogans and
high-decibel loudspeakers, Ms Doi attempted to inspire shoppers in a mall at
Takarazuka, a Hyogo city famed for an all-women theatre company which
performs 'Gone with the Wind' and 'Grand Hotel' to permanently sold-out
houses.
Introduced as the woman who can save Japan from the LDP, she told 200 people
the SDP would not fail at the polls 'in spite of the predictions of the
media'. Like Mr Hara, she is contemptuous of the newly-emerged parties and
their 'lack of beliefs and ideas'.
But Ms Doi is one of her party's greatest contradictions. An impressive
speaker who seems to want the SDP to be a genuine alternative to the LDP,
she remains an unrepentant ideologue.
As leader, Ms Doi maintained the traditional support for totalitarian North
Korea, and was unable to draft a coherent economic policy.
'I don't vote for the Socialist party, but I do vote for Doi san,' explained
a 34-year-old woman standing in the Takarazuka mall. 'I think she is a
wonderful person. I trust her and, for me, that is the most important thing.
I believe that she will try to do the right thing, even if her party does
the wrong thing.'

FT  15 JUL 93 / Japanese Elections: Opinion polls predict big socialist loss
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
JAPAN'S ruling Liberal Democratic party will not gain a parliamentary
majority in Sunday's election but the Social Democratic party, the largest
opposition group, will be a bigger loser, according to opinion polls
released yesterday.
The results of the newspaper-sponsored polls, the largest of which sampled
110,000 voters, reflected increasing support for newer, pro-reform parties
such as the Japan New party and the Japan Renewal party, both of which could
win 40-50 seats in the 511-seat parliament.
But the LDP, which entered the election with 227 seats after losing the
support of one of its factions, may not be as battered as was predicted when
the government of Mr Kiichi Miyazawa fell after losing a no-confidence
motion late last month.
It is now expected to secure 220-230 seats.
The polls - published by the Nikkei Shimbun, the Yomiuri Shimbun, the Asahi
Shimbun and the Mainichi Shimbun daily newspapers - indicated many voters
had yet to decide. But they suggested the LDP would form a coalition
government, with the JNP likely to have enough seats to make it an
influential partner.
There is also a possibility that the JNP could form a coalition with
opposition parties, but Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the party's leader, has
suggested a coalition with the LDP is more likely.
However, Mr Hosokawa has also suggested a coalition government is likely to
collapse quickly. This would force another election within a year, giving
his party and other new groups more time to prepare for a campaign and
select candidates.
The snap poll has put pressure on the new parties; the JRP has been able to
muster only 69 candidates, the JNP 57 and the New Party Harbinger 16. JRP
officials are already planning for the next election, which they expect
early next year.
Each of the polls indicated that the SDP, which now has 140 seats and has
traditionally won the protest vote, would be badly bruised on Sunday.
Estimates put the number of seats it is likely to win at between 69 to 100.
The party appears to have alienated old supporters through a last-minute
attempt to overhaul a foreign policy more appropriate to the 1970s, but it
has also put off other potential voters by not reforming the policies
quickly enough.
On average, the four polls found that the Japan Communist party would keep
its present total of 16 seats, and could take as many as 20 seats.
Meanwhile, the Komeito, backed by the Soka Gakkai religious movement, is
expected to keep its 46 seats.
If the polls are accurate, a coalition among the Komeito, SDP, JNP and JRP
could form a new government. But policy differences should ensure their
administration was short-lived.

CHINESE industry more than doubled its earnings in the first five months of
1993, according to figures released yesterday, Reuter reports from Beijing.
The State Statistics Bureau said the country's 357,000 industrial
enterprises earned nearly Yn51.3bn (Pounds 5.9bn) from January to May, a 110
per cent increase over the same period last year, the official China Daily
newspaper reported. Sales were up nearly 40 per cent to Yn1,104bn and
pre-tax profits rose nearly 50 per cent to Yn129.6bn.
'The impressive gains concealed problems that, if not resolved in good time,
might drain the economy and stifle market demand,' the bureau was quoted as
saying. 'The speed-up in industrial production has been excessive and has
created tension between sectors of the economy.'
The official Xinhua news agency said efficiency at large and medium-size
state enterprises was up 17 per cent. It attributed this to more autonomous
management, growth of heavy industry and rising consumption in coastal
provinces. Much of the earnings gain came from the enterprises.

FT  15 JUL 93 / Israeli ban on PLO links under review
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JERUSALEM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ONE of Israel's greatest taboos - a ban on direct contacts with the
Palestine Liberation Organisation - is under serious review.
Since Mr Yitzhak Rabin's government came to power last year unofficial
contacts between Israelis and the Tunis-based PLO, long castigated as
terrorists bent on the destruction of the Jewish state, have mushroomed.
There is an increasing number of senior Israeli politicians who now believe
a durable peace with Palestinians will not be possible without face-to-face
talks with the PLO.
'If you are going to talk business you had better talk with the boss,' said
Mr Benny Temkin, an MP from the Meretz party, Mr Rabin's most important
coalition partner. '
Despite government statements this week denying that officials have recently
met the PLO, the belief that there is a secret dialogue refuses to go away.
The respected daily Haaretz newspaper said yesterday a senior
Arabic-speaking Labour party official had had five or six meetings with PLO
officials including Mr Nabil Shaath and Mr Bassam Abu Sharif in Egypt and
the US. Haaretz said that after each meeting Mr Rabin was briefed in
writing.
Mr Gad Ben-Ari, Mr Rabin's spokesman, denied the contacts again yesterday
but, whatever the truth, it is clear there is a growing body of opinion in
favour of direct dialogue with the PLO.
In January, the government repealed a law banning contact between individual
Israelis and PLO officials. Several MPs have since held public meetings with
PLO officials and one radical Labour MP Ms Yael Dayan met Mr Yassir Arafat,
the PLO chairman, in Tunis.
Meretz, which has 12 MPs in the 120-strong Knesset and four cabinet posts,
is publicly committed to direct contacts with the organisation. Mr Temkin
said the coalition agreement allows Meretz to raise the issue and 'we are
doing it now.'
At least one Labour party minister, Mr Uzi Baram, has also come out in
favour of direct talks and a Labour MP claimed last week a further seven
Labour party ministers privately supported the idea, which, if true, would
mean an 11-7 majority in the cabinet.
Furthermore, critics of the government say Mr Rabin's acceptance of the
inclusion in the Palestinian peace delegation of Mr Faisal Husseini, who is
close to Mr Arafat, was a tacit acceptance of a PLO role.
The issue has become more critical as the peace talks have faltered,
especially over whether east Jerusalem should be included in the interim
phase of Palestinian self-rule.
Other issues critical to a peace deal, such as territorial concessions on
the occupied West Bank and security guarantees, need PLO involvement, say
experts.
However, an official change of policy will have to overcome two considerable
obstacles. The first, according to Mr Ben-Ari, is that 'Arafat personally is
viewed as a vicious, anti-Semitic demon and a symbol of so many things
Israelis despise.'
Opening a dialogue would be politically dangerous and play into the hands of
the right-wing opposition Likud party.
The second is that the Israeli government believes that a formal inclusion
of the PLO in the peace process will lead the talks away from the interim
phase of self-rule and towards the much more sensitive issue of an
independent Palestinian state.
Most observers believe that any change in government policy will be gradual.
But they say that progress on the peace talks will be difficult if not
impossible without the PLO's official involvement in some shape.

Hong Kong's foreign currency reserves rose by Dollars 6bn to Dollars 35.2bn
(Pounds 23.7bn) at the end of 1992, Mr Hamish Macleod, the colony's
financial secretary said yesterday, Simon Holberton writes from Hong Kong.
At the end of last year Hong Kong had the ninth largest stock of foreign
currency reserves. Taiwan's reserves were USDollars 83bn, while China's -
excluding the external assets of Bank of China - were about USDollars 20bn.
Hong Kong disclosed its external position for the first time a year ago. The
colony's reserves are managed by the newly created Monetary Authority - a
central bank in all but name. The Authority is responsible for maintaining
the Hong Kong dollar's fixed link with the dollar - at HKDollars 7.8 - and
regulates the colony's banking system and money market.
The development of the money market is one of the Authority's prime aims. In
1992 the stock of outstanding short-term money market instruments rose to
HKDollars 19.3bn from HKDollars 13.6bn in 1992.

<TEXT>
ISRAEL sent 1,000 soldiers and a fleet of tanks and armoured vehicles to its
self-declared security zone in southern Lebanon yesterday, sparking renewed
speculation of an imminent attack against Arab guerrillas, writes Julian
Ozanne in Jerusalem.
Israeli aircraft flew mock raids over both south and eastern Lebanon and the
inner cabinet discussed a list of possible military actions against Arab
guerrillas operating in Lebanon as retaliation for the killing of five
Israeli soldiers last week.
In Beirut Mr Rafik Hariri, the Lebanese prime minister, said the escalation
in tension was aimed at putting pressure on his government to make
concessions in the Arab-Israeli peace talks to the detriment of Lebanese
sovereignty and dignity. 'We will not submit to any blackmail from Israel,'
he said.
Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the Israeli prime minister, has vowed to strike back
against the Palestinian and pro-Iranian Hizbollah guerrillas, responsible
for last weeks' deaths.
Senior Israeli officials, however, played down the possibility of a serious
strike especially while Mr Dennis Ross, the US peace talks coordinator, was
in the region. Mr Ross left for Washington yesterday.
Syria, which Israel blamed for the surge in violence, also called yesterday
for the US to discourage an Israeli retaliation.
It said such action could jeopardise the next round of peace talks.

<TEXT>
JAPANESE police yesterday arrested four executives of Kirin Brewery, the
country's leading beer and food maker, on charges of making illegal payments
to gangsters.
Kirin is alleged to have paid about Y33m (Pounds 203,700) to gangsters to
ensure order at their shareholders' meeting held last March. It is common
for gangsters to appear at shareholders' meetings to ask awkward questions
and embarrass a company's board.
Corporate payments to stop disruption of shareholders' meetings are seen as
an easy source of income. However, the police have been tightening their
grip over such violations of the commercial code.
Last October, Mr Masatoshi Ito, the president of Ito-Yokado, a leading
retailer which also controls Southland of the US, was forced to resign
following arrests of company executives who had allegedly made illegal
payments of over Y27m to gangsters.
The police yesterday also arrested eight members of Rondan Doyukai, a
gangster group also linked to the Ito-Yokado case. They said the payments to
Rondan allowed Kirin to conclude its most recent shareholders' meeting in
March within 24 minutes.
The arrests come ahead of the government's scheduled reform of the
commercial code in October aimed at providing more information to
shareholders and making it easier for shareholders to sue corporate
management.
Many companies fear that the changes could encourage gangsters to threaten
corporations.

FT  15 JUL 93 / Italy told to recall Somali force chief
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE United Nations has demanded the recall to Rome of the freewheeling
commander of Italian troops in Somalia and may have to consider removing his
entire contingent, a senior UN official disclosed last night.
Mr Kofi Annan, who is in charge of all UN peacekeeping operations, told a
press conference that General Bruno Loi would soon be 'rotated' home, at the
express request of Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the secretary-general.
Italian soldiers serving with the UN would probably be redeployed north of
Mogadishu, away from the scene of recent bloody clashes.
Alluding to Gen Loi's reported defiance of orders by Gen Civek Bir, the
Turkish commander of all UN troops in Somalia, Mr Annan said the option of
removing a national contingent altogether might have to be considered when
it placed an entire enterprise in jeopardy.
He warned other governments that had presumed to dictate to their troops
over the heads of Gen Bir and former US Admiral Jonathan Howe, the
secretary-general's special envoy, that this behaviour was unacceptable.
One contingent had even refused to accept assignments for a month, placing
an extra burden on other troops who were not so well equipped, he revealed,
without identifying the recalcitrant unit.
He denied reports that the UN refused to negotiate with Gen Mohamed Farah
Aideed, the fugitive Somali warlord or that the warlord, whose arrest and
detention have been ordered, was singled out as a special villain. The UN
was prepared to deal similarly with any other rebel faction, if necessary.
He observed that the governments that committed troops to the UN command
knew what they were getting into and that it was an enforcement operation,
not the traditional peacekeeping mission.
Violence was mainly in southern Mogadishu, the Aideed stronghold, while much
of the rest of Somalia including the northern part of the capital, had been
pacified and was co-operating with the UN.
Somali militants yesterday distributed leaflets in the streets of south
Mogadishu in which they vowed to kill all US troops serving with the UN
mission and called on Moslems worldwide to kill Americans in their
countries.
The 'fatwah', a Moslem death warrant, was a clear sign that Gen Aideed's
militias are steeling themselves for a protracted struggle against the
14,000 UN troops stationed in the capital.
It also appeared to be an attempt to drive a wedge between the 4,000
American soldiers and other contingents fighting under the UN flag.
'We appeal to all countries of the multinational force to stay far from the
American sites in Mogadishu,' the leaflet, signed by The Moslem Voice, said.
'We are going to launch an attack to the American compounds in Mogadishu,'
it said.
Mr Barry Walkley, the UN spokesman in Mogadishu, said he had not seen the
pamphlets, but placed little importance on them. 'It sounds like a plea of
desperation to me. I don't think we will see massive attacks against US
installations,' he said.
Meanwhile, the death toll from Monday's Cobra assault on an Aideed compound
continued to rise.
The International Committee of the Red Cross, which has access to
Mogadishu's primitive hospitals, said 50 people were killed.

   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
REICHMANN International and Soros Realty, the property companies run by Mr
Paul Reichmann and Mr George Soros, have agreed in principle to develop a
new stage of the huge Santa Fe real estate scheme in Mexico City, in a
project that could be worth about Dollars 500m (Pounds 337.8m).
The companies, which formed a joint venture in February, are also
negotiating property developments that could be worth up to Dollars 500m in
the Alameda district in the city centre, and up to Dollars 300m in the
construction of two tower blocks on the city's main avenue, Paseo de la
Reforma.
They are looking for partners to spread the cost. Sources close to Mr Soros
said the sums mentioned would 'only represent the total value over a long
time and would not represent any specific investment laid out'. They said
talks over the Alameda shopping and residential project were 'nowhere near
complete'.
Mr Juan Enriquez Cabot, the city government official in charge of the Santa
Fe development, said the investment was a vote of confidence in Mexico and
its economic future.
Observers may also interpret Mr Soros's interest as his blessing for the
peso, which is considered vulnerable to the sort of speculative attack
favoured by the US financier and his hedge funds.
The Soros and Reichmann companies had agreed in principle to buy about
120,000 square metres of land in Santa Fe on the western outskirts of Mexico
City, Mr Enriquez Cabot said. The companies will develop the fourth stage of
the Dollars 5bn-Dollars 10bn project, building houses, office blocks, and
shopping centres in what was once a rubbish dump and strip mine.
Mr Soros's Quantum Realty Fund will not take a stake in the proposed
investments. While the fund is advised by Reichmann International and Soros
Realty, its purpose is to invest in finished developments in the US and
Canada.

FT  15 JUL 93 / Energy tax plan may change
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONGRESSIONAL Democrats met yesterday to discuss their strategy for
hammering out a compromise US budget bill, amid signs of a move towards a
new variant on the proposed energy tax, which would raise money from both
transportation fuels and utilities.
The energy tax proposal, suggested by Mr Dan Rostenkowski, who as chairman
of the House of Representatives ways and means committee is Congress's
principal tax writer, is being floated as a way out of the impasse between
the two different levies passed by the House and the Senate.
While the House kept the outlines of the energy tax originally proposed by
President Bill Clinton, to be calculated at 26.8 cents per million British
thermal units, the Senate adopted a much more modest proposal to tax petrol
and diesel fuel at 4.3 cents per gallon.
The Btu tax appears to be dead, but House representatives are expected to
insist that its replacement raise something much closer to the Dollars 72bn
(Pounds 48.6bn) they expected from it than to the Dollars 23bn the Senate
fuel tax would raise. It is unclear at what rates the Rostenkowski tax would
apply, but by adding electricity it would spread some of the burden of the
transportation tax, which falls disproportionately on western states.
One rival proposal would scrap energy taxes altogether but stiffen the
increases already planned in company and upper income tax rates.
The conference between House and Senate delegates to resolve the differences
between their versions of the budget bill is expected to prove particularly
difficult because of the narrow margins by which the original bills passed
in each chamber.
Mr Clinton cannot expect a single Republican vote in either chamber, but
Democratic whips say he can count on little more than 200 of the 258
Democrats in the House, and perhaps no more than 40 of the 56 Democrats in
the Senate.
Every adjustment to the bill threatens to cost him support from either the
right or the left: if spending is increased too much, he will lose
conservatives, and if it is increased too little, he will lose liberals.
One thing the House and the Senate had seemed to agree on was the overall
target of reducing the US budget deficit from its current trend by Dollars
500bn over five years. Even this, however, has now been called into
question, with Senator John Breaux of Louisiana suggesting a more modest
deficit reduction goal of Dollars 400bn.

FT  15 JUL 93 / Clinton to seek Dollars 2.5bn aid for flooded states
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton will propose Dollars 2.48bn (Pounds 1.7bn) of aid for
the six states in the Mississippi and Missouri basins devastated by record
floods, White House officials said yesterday.
The money is expected to be included in an emergency bill to go to Congress
shortly.
Mr Clinton cut short his holiday in Hawaii to fly back for his second visit
to the flooded area yesterday, inspecting relief efforts in Des Moines,
Iowa, where the swollen Raccoon River has knocked out the city's water
purification plant and cut off clean water supplies to 250,000 people.
The tide of grandees visiting the region - Vice-President Al Gore visited on
Monday and Mr Clinton may return this weekend to St Louis - places its own
logistical burden on emergency workers already stretched thin. However, the
White House appears desperately keen to signal its close involvement with
the disaster.
Some political commentators have gone as far as to suggest that Mr Clinton,
by attending the Group of Seven industrial nation's summit in Tokyo last
week, was allowing himself to be turned into a foreign policy president no
different from his predecessor, Mr George Bush.
Others had noted the contrast between pictures of Mr Clinton frolicking in
the surf during his holiday and the Iowans and Missourians up to their necks
in floodwater.
However, there is little evidence that the US public at large begrudges Mr
Clinton his few days of holiday, but political pundits recall the
difficulties that Mr Bush's holiday habits brought on him.
Ms Dee Dee Myers, White House press secretary, said the relief aid request
would cover the rest of fiscal 1993, to September 30, and would be part of
an emergency supplemental spending request.
Democratic congressional leaders have said they would try to speed action on
any proposed flood relief. Mr Clinton was expected to discuss the matter
with bipartisan members of Congress during a visit to Capitol Hill today.
Damage estimates from Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, South
Dakota and Wisconsin put the flood's cost so far at around Dollars 3bn -
Dollars 2bn for destruction of crops and Dollars 1bn in other property
damage. Even before Mr Clinton arrived, Iowa Governor Terry Branstad said he
doubted that the federal aid would be enough.
The US budget director, Mr Leon Panetta said yesterday he would not be
surprised if aid eventually reached Dollars 5bn.

FT  15 JUL 93 / Rise in US retail sales: Modest growth expected as
inflationary pressures ease
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US consumer spending rose significantly in the second quarter while
inflationary pressures moderated, official figures indicated yesterday.
This suggests that the US economy, after sharp price increases and
negligible growth in an erratic first quarter, is returning to last year's
path of moderate growth and subdued inflation. Fears that the Federal
Reserve, the central bank, would push up interest rates in the near future
have all but evaporated.
The Commerce Department said retail sales rose 0.4 per cent between May and
June and sharply revised upwards estimates of spending in previous months.
The Labour Department said consumer prices were flat last month after a
marginal 0.1 per cent increase in May.
Official figures earlier this week showed a 0.3 per cent decline in
wholesale prices last month, the biggest in two years.
In May the Fed reacted to signs of rising inflationary pressures by shifting
from a neutral monetary stance to a bias toward raising short-term rates.
However, it is now expected to take a more relaxed attitude towards
pressures and to postpone a tightening of monetary policy at least until the
autumn, perhaps until next year.
Retail sales in April and May were revised up sharply to show monthly gains
of 1.9 per cent and 0.4 per cent respectively, against previous estimates of
1.5 per cent and 0.1 per cent.
The latest figures suggest that real consumer spending grew at an annual
rate of about 3 per cent in the second quarter, a sharp rebound after growth
of less than 1 per cent in the first quarter. The recovery was led by big
increases in car sales. Sales of clothing and general household goods also
improved noticeably.

FT  15 JUL 93 / City seethes in summit shadow: Prospects and problems for
the Ibero-American conference, opening in Brazil today
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VERONICA BARUFFATI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LEADERS began gathering in north-eastern Brazil yesterday for the third
Ibero-American conference, which will focus on economic development and
social justice.
The two-day summit, which starts today in the city of Salvador, brings
together Latin American heads of state and those of the region's former
colonial powers, Spain and Portugal.
Much of the two days will be spent drafting a document - An Agenda for
Development, with emphasis on social development - to be presented to Mr
Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary general, for further discussion at the
UN.
Most of the participating countries share urgent problems, such as high
infant mortality, poor access to basic health and education services,
illiteracy, malnutrition and endemic disease. Since May, ministerial
meetings have been drawing up working papers aimed at tackling some of the
issues.
Away from the conference's main agenda, President Alberto Fujimori of Peru
is expected to use the gathering to further his international rehabilitation
following criticism of his dissolution of Congress and seizure of wide
powers in April last year.
Admiring Brazilian press articles on Peru's economic progress under Mr
Fujimori pushed Brazil's President Itamar Franco to pledge this week that
there would be no 'Fujimorisation' of Brazilian society.
Citizens of the habitually languorous city of Salvador, Brazil's first
capital, have been sharply critical of preparations for the conference and
the accompanying facelift.
Many claim the meeting will do little to solve everyday problems.
In recent weeks the city has seen feverish activity to spruce up areas
between the airport, the convention centre and the hotels where 21 leaders,
including Cuba's President Fidel Castro, will be staying.
Armies of otherwise unemployed men have donned bright yellow uniforms to
resurface and paint the city's two main arteries and to clear up years of
rubbish dumped alongside the roads and washed up on the city's beaches.
Hotels have rebuilt suites, and restaurants near the conference area have
been subjected to weeks of rigorous inspection.
In recent years parts of the historical centre, Pelourinho, with its
magnificent churches and colonial architecture, have been restored, becoming
one of Brazil's main tourist attractions.

FT  15 JUL 93 / Regional aid rules approved
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MEPs last night over-whelmingly approved new rules for the EC's 1994-99
regional development and structural aid programme, removing a major hurdle
for disbursement of around Ecu141.5bn (Pounds 107.96bn) in the new year.
The favourable parliamentary opinion paves the way for the final go-ahead of
the biggest-ever EC development programme at a meeting of EC foreign
ministers next Monday, barring last-minute objections from Ireland and
Greece.
Under the deal the UK will receive special aid for Merseyside and the
Scottish Highlands, including Argyll, Bute and West Moray.
With this and other funding, the UK could receive between Ecu5bn and Ecu6bn
over the next six years.
Prospects for a comprehensive deal rose earlier this week after the Irish
government lifted its veto, despite its claim to IPounds 8bn which it claims
was guaranteed in last December's EC summit in Edinburgh.
Mr Albert Reynolds, Irish prime minister, has been in close touch with Mr
Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, and Mr Bruce Millan,
EC commissioner responsible for regional affairs, in an effort to resolve
outstanding differences.
MEPs voted 317 to 8, with only four objections, and generally welcomed the
new aid programme.

Ukraine's parliament yesterday demanded Russia withdraw its claim to the

MPs described the Russian parliament's claim on Sevastopol, in the Ukrainian

decision be formally repealed. They said it was unacceptable for the
unilateral Russian claim on part of their territory to remain on the
law-books.
President Boris Yeltsin has condemned his parliament's move.

FT  15 JUL 93 / West Europe car sales plummet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEW CAR sales in western Europe plunged by 1.3m to 6.091m in the first half
of the year - a fall of 17.2 per cent. Demand declined steeply in all the
main markets except Britain's. .
Sales last month fell by an estimated 16.4 per cent to 950,000, the sixth
steep monthly fall in succession. The situation was worst in Italy, where
year-on-year registrations dropped by 29.5 per cent.
Overall sales last month were lower than a year ago in 14 of 17 European
markets. There were marginal rises in Denmark and Portugal, and stronger
growth in Britain, where sales rose by 11.1 per cent. The UK, recovering
from recession, has seen sales increase year-on-year in 12 of the past 15
months.
West Europe has suffered its steepest six-monthly fall in new car sales for
more than a decade, with first-half demand lower in 15 of 17 markets.
The decline was led by a 19.9 per cent fall in Germany, Europe's biggest
single market. Sales fell to an estimated 1.75m from 2.19m in the same
period last year. First half sales in Spain were down by 29.3 per cent, in
Italy by 22.5 per cent, and in France by 17.9 per cent.
Only Britain made a significant gain - of 9.1 per cent, albeit from a
depressed level.
Volkswagen, Fiat and Ford suffered steep falls. The Fiat group, which
includes Lancia and Alfa Romeo, lost most ground in the first six months.
Sales plunged by an estimated 22.1 per cent compared with the 17.2 per cent
drop in the overall west European market.
General Motors, which includes Opel/Vauxhall and Saab, gained market share
helped by the successful launch earlier this year of its Corsa small car
range.
Rover, the subsidiary of British Aerospace, is the only significant carmaker
in Europe to have lifted sales despite the decline in the overall market.
Volume rose by 10.5 per cent, increasing Rover's share to 2.8 per cent from
2.1 per cent in the same period a year ago.
Japanese carmakers have increased their share significantly from 11.6 per
cent to 12.5 per cent, heightening tensions between the European Community
and Tokyo over the level of Japanese car exports to the EC.
Nissan, Toyota and Suzuki have performed strongly this year helped by local
production in Britain and Spain, which has enabled them to penetrate
protected markets in southern Europe.

FT  15 JUL 93 / Garofano to be questioned today
</HEADLINE>

   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Giuseppe Garofano, the most important businesman sought in Italy's
political corruption scandal, is expected to be interrogated by Milan
magistrates in Geneva today.
Mr Garofano was arrested by Swiss police on Tuesday evening as he arrived at
Geneva airport from Paris. Unconfirmed reports say he was planning to go to
Milan to give himself up following contacts between his lawyers and Milan
judges. Last night, Mr Garofano was reported to have asked for a week's
'reflection' to decide whether to accept extradition to Italy.
Magistrates want to question Mr Garofano, formerly the most senior executive
in the troubled Ferruzzi group outside the Ferruzzi family, on three
matters.
The first is a L250m (Pounds 107,000) donation to the Christian Democrat
party, the issue which apparently triggered Mr Garofano's decision to flee.
Mr Garofano maintained the money was a personal contribution.
However, Milan magistrates, suspecting the money may have come from
Ferruzzi, issued a warrant for illegal funding of political parties. Mr
Garofano's name has come up in two other investigations since his
disappearance. Milan magistrates monitoring the Ferruzzi rescue plan have
been investigating the finances of some foreign subsidiaries.
Last month, Montedison, Ferruzzi's main industrial arm, shocked shareholders
with a L435bn increase in its 1992 group loss to L1,679bn on account of
mysterious credits, deemed irrecoverable, by a small Curacao subsidiary.
Magistrates may also want to interrogate Mr Garofano on the now-defunct
Enimont chemicals joint venture between Montedison and the state-owned Eni
energy and chemicals group. A number of executives involved in Enimont,
including Mr Raul Gardini, Montedison's former boss, have already been told
that they are under investigation.
Mr Garofano's detention marks the first time a leading suspect in the
corruption scandal has been arrested on an international warrant. Previous
suspects have returned to Italy from hiding after lengthy negotiations
between the judges and their lawyers.

FT  15 JUL 93 / Community prepares for enlargement

EUROPEAN Community foreign ministers will discuss a proposal to create a
committee of 'wise men' to examine streamlining EC institutions in order to
deal with enlargement, the Belgian Presidency of the EC announced yesterday.
The proposal could serve as the platform for a new constitutional debate on
the future of the EC, raising sensitive questions such as the balance of
power between large and small states and a reorganisation of the European
Commission and rotating EC presidency.
The idea of opening up a 'post-Maastricht' debate has been circulating for
several months in the European parliament and among European think-tanks.
Proponents suggest a high-powered independent committee could be modelled on
the 'Dooge committee' which paved the way for the 1986 Single European Act
creating an integrated market by 1992.
Mr Willy Claes, Belgium's foreign minister, made clear that the Belgian
presidency was not endorsing the idea which was put forward in the
parliament yesterday by Mr Willy De Clerq, a Belgian MEP and former EC
Commissioner. But he agreed to submit it for ministerial discussion.
Under the Danish and UK presidencies, ministers agreed that minimal change
only was required to cope with the four new applicants, Austria, Finland,
Sweden and Norway.
Last year, a European Commission paper suggesting that smaller states may
lose out in a future reorganisation of the Commission created a furore. The
mere hint that not every state might run its own EC presidency or send its
own commissioner to Brussels may have helped to trigger the narrow Danish
rejection of the Maastricht treaty.
Mr Claes declined to answer how broad a mandate might be given to a putative
committee of wise men. But some institutional questions would have to be
examined before a final decision on the admission of the four applicant
countries, notably their allocation of MEPs and the number of votes in the
Council of Ministers.
A UK official said the government was 'relaxed' about an institutional
discussion before the 1996 intergovernmental conference to review the
Maastricht treaty, providing it took a narrow definition of the need for
change.
Mr Claes told MEPs that the Belgian presidency was determined to restore the
authority of the European Commission and improve relations with the European
Parliament.
He added: 'The treaty of Maastricht is (thereby) not an endpoint but rather
a point of departure for further deepening and democratisation.'

<TEXT>
YESTERDAY'S Bastille Day holiday in France provided no respite for the
European exchange rate mechanism, with the French and Danish currencies
under renewed pressure.
Central banks in the Netherlands and Denmark intervened in support of the
Danish krone as it reached its lower intervention point against the guilder
in the ERM, while the Bundesbank again bought French francs in an attempt to
limit its slide.
Hopes of more substantial support through a cut in official interest rates
at today's Bundesbank council meeting were damped after the bank said it
would not be holding a press conference. The terms at which it elected to
lend funds to the German domestic money market yesterday also did little to
encourage expectations of lower rates.
The volume of funds provided as a result of the Bundesbank's latest
repurchase tender was at the upper end of expectations. But the rate at
which the money was provided - 7.28 per cent - was only marginally lower
than the 7.30 per cent charged previously.
There is no reason to doubt that German, French and EC monetary officials
have been sincere this week in declaring that they see no fundamental reason
for speculative pressure against the franc. But if the Bundesbank relaxes
its policy in response to external pressure, it could damage its long-term
credibility as an inflation fighter.
The krone closed at DKr3.8951 to the D-Mark, close to its floor of
DKr3.9016, while the franc closed in London at FFr3.417, down from the
previous day's FFr3.414.

FT  15 JUL 93 / Recession stalks new Gonzalez team: There are doubts the
cabinet has the stomach for the fight
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NEW Spanish government of Mr Felipe Gonzalez took office yesterday and
was greeted with a degree of scepticism by the financial community. Doubts
were cast on its stability and on its willingness to apply measures to curb
Spain's worsening recession.
Mr Gonzalez's Socialist party (PSOE) failed to win an overall majority in
last month's general election, and despite extensive talks with leaders of
the Basque and Catalan nationalist parties, the prime minister has failed to
persuade either group to join his government as a junior partner.
The absence of the nationalist parties, which would have assured Mr Gonzalez
of firm parliamentary support, lends a provisional look to the new
government. Both groups may change their minds, however, and try to join the
cabinet after the 1994 budget is approved following the the summer recess.
Mr Gonzalez's new team is built around Mr Narcis Serra, the deputy prime
minister in the previous government who is now given the additional
responsibility of co-ordinating economic policy. Mr Pedro Solbes, a
technocrat and a non-Socialist, has been promoted from the agriculture
ministry to run the economy and finance ministry.
Neither Mr Serra, a plodding consensus politician, nor Mr Solbes, who has a
record as an interventionist in defence of state industry, is viewed as a
tough personality willing to take on the challenges of a recession. A senior
Madrid corporate lawyer likened the new economic team yesterday to 'an
aspirin to cure a cancer'.
The difficulties facing the domestic economy have been underlined this week
by estimates which put the general budget deficit at 7 per cent of gross
domestic product. That is double the figure outlined in Spain's Emu
convergence plan and compares with 4.4 per cent last year. Year-on-year GDP
rose by 0.5 in the first quarter and growth forecasts for 1993 range between
zero and minus 1 per cent.
Inflation is nevertheless rising - it was up by 0.4 per cent in June to give
an underlying 12 month rate of 5.9 per cent - despite the recession and a
steep rise in unemployment. The number of registered jobless rose last month
by 35,351, the first June increase for 10 years, and the total number of job
seekers now stands at more than 2.5m, representing 16.6 per cent of the
working population.
Echoing a widely shared view in the financial community, Madrid stockbroker
FG forecast that the new government would avoid head-on collisions with the
unions, would do little to reduce the budget deficit and would deregulate
only under direct pressure from Brussels.
The one positive signal to the markets in the new government is the
exclusion from the cabinet of the left wing of the PSOE which is championed
by the deputy party leader, Mr Alfonso Guerra. This is a second humiliation
suffered by the so-called guerristas. Mr Gonzalez has already foisted Mr
Carlos Solchaga, the former economy minister and a bitter foe of the
leftwing Socialists, on to the PSOE, as the party's leader and chief
spokesman in parliament.
Mr Gonzalez has retained as foreign minister Mr Javier Solana, who is no
friend of Mr Guerra, and he brought into the cabinet minor-ranking social
democrats, identified with the moderate wing of the party, as well as a
total of six independents, three of them women.
It is likely now that the prime minister will continue to wage his war on
the left wing by calling a party congress later this year or early in 1994.
The guerrista faction, which holds most of the senior positions within the
party, has been at the centre of scandals over illicit campaign funds that
have severely embarrassed Mr Gonzalez.
Should the latter deal a definitive blow to Mr Guerra's camp, and also meet
home rule demands made by the nationalists when he draws up next year's
budget, the way will be smoothed for the entry of the Basques and Catalans
into the cabinet.
A broad-based coalition government would have its stability assured over the
next four years. Given the more market-orientated policies of both the
Basques and the Catalans, such a government would help to boost confidence
about the economic policies that Mr Gonzalez may pursue in his fourth term
in office.

FT  15 JUL 93 / Mitterrand urges caution on sell-offs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Francois Mitterrand yesterday said that the conservative
government of prime minister Edouard Balladur must exercise 'extreme
caution' in the privatisation of state-owned companies important to national
interests.
Speaking in a televised interview, traditional on France's Bastille day
holiday, the Socialist president also said that the franc must be defended
and that the maintenance of its parity with the D-Mark in the the European
exchange rate mechanism was 'a necessity above all others.'
Mr Mitterrand cited Elf-Aquitaine, the oil group, Aerospatiale, the
aerospace company, and Snecma, the aero-engine maker, as examples where
caution was needed. Elf is expected to be one of the first companies to be
privatised as part of the government's programme commencing this autumn.
Stressing that there was no constitutional power to block the privatisation
law passed by parliament, he said: 'Once it has been passed I become a
notary. It is my duty to sign and I sign.'
But his comments reflect a debate within the ruling RPR and UDF parties
concerning the privatisation of sensitive industries and suggest that the
government may retain a 'golden share' to maintain control of companies
involved in defence, high technology and energy industries.
Mr Mitterrand appeared satisfied with his relations with the centre-right
government but refused to be drawn on his relations with Mr Balladur.
'I am in favour of applying the constitution. The people voted and that is
all,' he said, referring to the March general elections in which the
Socialists suffered a crushing defeat.
In a wide-ranging interview, Mr Mitterrand said that he was in favour of a
Gatt agreement on the liberalisation of international trade but that any
agreement 'must be fair.' He said that problems remained in the sphere of
agricultural trade despite greater than expected progress at the G7 summit
in Tokyo earlier this month.
The French president called for measures to stimulate consumption and to
revive the economy. He said that 'everything had been tried' in the fight
against unemployment, but that the government should continue to search for
new remedies. Mr Mitterrand, appearing relaxed and sharp during the
interview, said he had 'recuperated while working' following surgery for
prostate cancer last September.

CROATIA'S plan to re-open a strategic bridge this weekend risks re-igniting
the Serbo-Croat war, a senior UN official warned yesterday, writes Laura
Silber in Belgrade.
Mr Cedric Thornberry, deputy chief of the UN mission in former Yugoslavia,
said: 'Both sides are armed to the teeth, and both have brought up
reinforcements. Both are preparing for an escalating conflict.
'In these circumstances, the risk of war breaking out again becomes really
very high.'
Frustrated by Serb intransigence on the opening of Maslenica bridge, which
links the main coastal motorway with central Croatia, and the nearby Zemunik
airport, Croat authorities are poised to re-establish the vital road link.
Serb forces from the self-styled state of Krajina have warned they will
bombard the bridge if the Croats go ahead with a temporary pontoon bridge.
Serbs have trained three Frog missiles on Zagreb, the Croatian capital, say
UN officials posted in the region.
'The Croat authorities and the territorial defence forces of the Serbian
Krajina are engaging in brinkmanship around Maslenica and the Zemunik
airport,' Mr Thornberry said in Belgrade.
Croat forces seized control of the area in their offensive on January 22
across UN lines. Since then, they have ignored a UN Security Council
resolution calling for their withdrawal to the ceasefire line agreed on
January 3, 1992.
Croatia wants to re-assert authority over Serb-held parts which comprise the
four UN zones. Resentment has mounted against UN peacekeepers for failing to
fulfil the peace plan to allow the return of Croat refugees to UN zones.

MR Douglas Hurd, the British foreign secretary, yesterday hinted that the EC
could decide as soon as next Monday to implement sanctions against Croatia.
The time had come for the EC to 'consider economic measures' against the
Croatians, he told members of parliament, write David Owen in London and
Laura Silber in Belgrade.
Mr Hurd said he thought there was a 'strong case' for having a Moslem
'contingent' among UN troops stationed in Bosnia. He believed, however, that
Iran would not be a 'suitable candidate' for providing such troops.
Nato yesterday agreed that US, French, British and Dutch strike aircraft
could start protecting UN forces in Bosnia, including those in Moslem safe
areas, from next week.
A meeting of the alliance's ambassadors decided the mission could start from
July 22 but left any decision on timing to the UN.
The mainly Moslem Bosnian army yesterday appeared to strike back from the
air for the first time in the 16-month war in Bosnia when three aircraft
dropped bombs on Serb-held targets.
If yesterday's incident is confirmed, it would be a violation of the no-fly
zone in force over the whole of Bosnia since last October.
Tanjug, the Serb news agency, said three aircraft bombarded Serb-held
positions near Olovo in central Bosnia.
In a bid to raise Dollars 200m, the mininum amount needed to keep the relief
operation going, Mrs Sadako Ogata, UN High Commissioner for Refugees, met
Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic to discuss to the plight of 380,000
people trapped in the Bosnian capital.

FT  15 JUL 93 / Italy told to recall commander in Somalia

THE ROW between the United Nations and Italy over Somalia deepened last
night after the UN demanded the recall to Rome of the commander of Italian
troops there and signalled that it may request the removal of the country's
entire contingent.
Mr Beniamino Andreatta, the Italian foreign minister, told parliament he was
'outraged' at the decision that General Bruno Loi, who is alleged to have
defied the orders of the overall UN commander in Somalia, would soon be
rotated home.
The move, ordered by Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary general, was
announced at a press conference in New York by Mr Kofi Annan, who is in
charge of UN peacekeeping operations.
Alluding to Gen Loi's reported defiance of orders from General Civek Bir,
the Turkish commander of UN troops in Somalia, Mr Annan said the option of
removing a national contingent altogether might have to be considered when
it placed an entire enterprise in jeopardy and other contingents at risk.
Italian soldiers serving with the UN would probably be redeployed north of
Mogadishu, away from the scene of recent clashes, he added.
Yesterday's exchange between Rome and New York deepened the sense of
disarray surrounding the UN military intervention in Somalia, as Somali
militants stepped up their campaign against the international force in the
capital, Mogadishu. Mr Annan warned other governments that had dictated to
their troops over the heads of Gen Bir and former US Admiral Jonathan Howe,
the secretary-general's special envoy, that this behaviour was unacceptable.
One contingent had even refused to accept assignments for a month, placing
an extra burden on other troops who were not so well equipped, he said
without identifying the recalcitrant unit.
He denied the UN refused to negotiate with General Mohamed Farah Aideed, the
fugitive Somali warlord, or that the warlord, whose arrest and detention
have been ordered, was singled out as a special villain. The UN was prepared
to deal similarly with any other rebel faction, if necessary.
He said governments that had committed troops to UN command knew what they
were getting into and that it was an enforcement operation, not a
traditional peacekeeping mission. Much of Somalia including the northern
part of the capital was co-operating with the UN.
Somali militants yesterday distributed leaflets in the streets of south
Mogadishu in which they vowed to kill all US troops serving with the UN
mission and called on Moslems worldwide to kill Americans in their
countries.
The fatwa, a Moslem death warrant, was a clear sign that Gen Aideed's
militias are steeling themselves for a protracted struggle against the
14,000 UN troops stationed in the capital. It also appeared to be an attempt
to drive a wedge between the 4,000 American soldiers and other national
contingents fighting under the UN flag.
Somali forces later launched an attack on the airport, in the south of the
city, firing rocket-propelled grenades and small arms.
UN military headquarters said Somali snipers also fired on Tunisian troops
at the headquarters compound, while Italian forces were also reported to
have come under attack at a checkpoint to the north of the city.
There were no reports on casualties.

FT  15 JUL 93 / SFO to probe Gooda Walker syndicates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LLOYD'S OF LONDON, hit by record losses and troubled by legal action, faced
fresh controversy yesterday when the Serious Fraud Office launched a formal
investigation into the insurance market's biggest loss-making syndicates.
The investigation into the affairs of insurance syndicates formerly managed
by the Gooda Walker agency at Lloyd's presents the market with further
difficulties just as it is trying to attract corporate investors.
Gooda Walker syndicates lost more than Pounds 900m between 1987 and 1990,
nearly a sixth of the market's overall losses of more than Pounds 6bn in the
past six years.
The SFO decision to investigate follows its review of a report into the four
Gooda Walker syndicates by Mr Ken Randall, a director of the insurance
agency now managing their affairs.
The Randall report, handed to the SFO in April, alleged that Gooda Walker
syndicates artificially inflated their profits during the 1980s by improper
use of 'time and distance' policies. These are reinsurance policies that
allow Lloyd's syndicates to manage their reserves against so-called
'long-tail' claims more effectively. Long-tail claims come many years after
the start of policies.
Mr Randall is examining other areas of the syndicates' business, in
particular other reinsurance transactions.
Mr David Rowland, Lloyd's chairman, said he had decided to publicise the
investigation which he said ran parallel to Lloyd's own inquiries. 'I was
determined to get it into the public arena. We want to deal with this
rigorously.'
Mr Rowland, however, conceded that the announcement could damage confidence
in the market and make it more difficult to attract corporate capital.
Although Lloyd's new leadership has made considerable progress in improving
the market's efficiency and its image in recent months, some would-be
investors have been affected by recent publicity over loss-making Names -
the individuals whose assets support the market.
The investigation also looks certain to lead to a deterioration in relations
between Lloyd's and Gooda Walker Names. Following news of the investigation
the Names are pressing Lloyd's to suspend moves to draw down their assets.
Some 4,500 Gooda Names are expecting to pay cash calls totalling some Pounds
157m at the end of this month, which represents an average burden of about
Pounds 35,000 for each of the Gooda Names.
'Many Names are near destitution and any further cash demands on them
against a background of fraud investigation would be wholly wrong and offend
natural justice,' said Mr Tom Benyon, vice-chairman of the Gooda Walker
Action Group.
Mr Rowland insisted that Lloyd's would go ahead with its plans to issue cash
calls and draw down the deposits of Gooda Walker Names.
'We have a duty to pay claims,' he said.
Mr Michael Deeny, chairman of the action group, said despite support for
efforts to achieve an out-of-court settlement the Gooda Walker Names
intended to press ahead with their legal action alleging negligence by their
agents.
The case could come to court in the first half of next year.

FT  15 JUL 93 / Peers reject call for referendum on Maastricht treaty
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT last night delivered a crushing blow to a last-ditch attempt
to force a referendum on Maastricht, as the House of Lords rejected a
passionate plea from Lady Thatcher to allow the British people to decide
whether to surrender more of their powers to the European Community.
But Mr John Major still faces a strong challenge next Thursday in the
Commons debate on the social chapter. A coalition of opposition parties in
favour of the social agreement and Tory rebel MPs still seeking to frustrate
ratification threatens to defeat the government.
Some Tory Euro-sceptics plan to support a Labour move to prevent the UK
ratifying the treaty until it has committed itself to the social agreement.
Ministers welcomed peers' decisive rejection of a referendum by 445 votes to
176. Government business managers hailed it as the highest turnout ever for
a Lords vote. Their efforts to ensure supporters attended was a sign of the
determination to crush the move for a referendum despite its high-profile
campaigners.
Lady Thatcher told a packed House that EC institutions were diminishing the
UK's parliamentary sovereignty so far and so fast that the people should be
asked if this was what they wanted.
'It is the people's turn to speak. It is their powers of which we are the
custodian,' she said.
But the idea of a referendum on Maastricht was firmly rejected by the
government and opposition front benches, as well as in a series of speeches
from former members of the Thatcher cabinet.
Lord Lawson used his maiden speech in the upper house to argue that the UK's
'opt-out' on monetary union meant a referendum was not needed. The former
chancellor added, however, that since in his view monetary union implied a
loss of national sovereignty, if the UK were ever to opt for monetary union,
a referendum should be held at that point.
Many peers, including Lord Wakeham, leader of the Lords, said embarking on a
referendum so long after signing the treaty and after going through so much
of the parliamentary process would do 'the greatest possible damage to
Britain's reputation' in the Community.
Yesterday's debate marked the climax of the Lords' consideration of the
Maastricht bill. Although a further stage remains, it will not provide the
same opportunity for a set-piece occasion, which saw peers crowding into the
chamber.
In a speech which again raised the profile of the Euro-sceptic cause, Lady
Thatcher painted a picture of a parliament in which representatives were no
longer accountable to those who had elected them because they had passed
decision-making powers to the European Commission and had failed to prevent
the European court extending its powers.
The UK had 'surrendered too many powers already. We should surrender no more
unless the people wish it,' she said.

FT  15 JUL 93 / Inflation nears 30-year low: Sterling gains against dollar
and D-Mark as hopes are raised for sustained recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INFLATION DROPPED to its lowest rate for almost 30 years last month,
stimulating hopes that the UK can sustain economic recovery while keeping
price rises under control.
Retail prices fell 0.1 per cent in June to bring the headline inflation rate
down to 1.2 per cent from 1.3 per cent in May. This was the lowest
year-on-year rate of inflation since February 1964.
Underlying inflation - the RPI excluding mortgage interest payments - was
steady at 2.8 per cent, the lowest 12-month rate since the series began in
1975.
The sluggishness of price rises, along with robust manufacturing output,
announced earlier this week, appeared to offer Mr John Major, the prime
minister, a chance to achieve low-inflation growth and revive his
government's fortunes.
The figures, which boosted the pound, will also support the government's
contention that the UK will be able to hold on to the competitive gains of
devaluation.
However, economists warned that inflation does not have much further to
fall. Although few expect underlying inflation to breach the ceiling of the
government's 1-4 per cent target range before the end of the year, many
believe that price pressures are starting to build slowly as demand for
consumer goods recovers and the higher cost of imports is passed on by
retailers.
The figures, which followed a string of encouraging economic data, boosted
the spirits of the Tory government and raised expectations of an early cut
in interest rates. However, Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, said it would
be wrong to leap to any conclusions about further monetary easing.
'At the moment, the economy is recovering perfectly sensibly. I don't expect
us to have good news all the time but at the moment the recovery isn't
looking fitful,' he said. 'In the last day or two it looks as though it is
strengthening a little.'
The Central Statistical Office said the latest fall was mainly due to an
early start to the summer sales. These were brought forward from July in an
attempt to underpin weak retail sales. There were also drops in telephone
and electricity charges.
Inflation has rarely been lower than 1.2 per cent since the end of the
1950s. On two occasions in 1963 it dropped below the current figure, and it
was once lower in 1964.
The City reacted well to the news, which came only a day after the
announcement that manufacturing output rose 1.8 per cent month-on-month in
May. Long dated bond yields, which reflect the market's expectations of
future inflation, fell below 8 per cent for the first time since early 1972.
The pound climbed against the D-Mark, closing up  3/4 of a pfennig at
DM2.5775. It was also slightly stronger against the dollar, ending the day
at Dollars 1.5025 compared with a previous close of Dollars 1.4935 and
trading later in New York at Dollars 1.5035. The figures had little impact
on share prices, however. The FT-SE share index closed down 4.8 at 2,832.3.
Commenting on the results, Mr Major said: 'The figures, taken together, show
we are in sight of our long-term goal: growth without inflation.'

FT  15 JUL 93 / (CORRECTED) UK Company News: Rooney's future remains unclear
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Correction (published 16th July 1993) appended to this article.
THE FUTURE of Mr Bill Rooney as chairman and chief executive of Spring Ram,
the bathrooms and kitchens group, was still unclear last night. The shares
closed 4p lower at 51p.
After three profit warnings within eight months, Mr Rooney is under pressure
from institutional shareholders to resign. This move is led by the
Prudential Corporation, which speaks for 35 per cent of the group's equity.
After a meeting yesterday, the company said: 'The board of Spring Ram, which
remains united in its support for Mr Bill Rooney, recognises and accepts the
need for immediate and major changes in the structure, style and management
of the company for the 1990s. Today's meeting has been adjourned to enable
the board to seek further advice on the implementation of these changes.'
Neither Mr Rooney or any of the other directors would expand on the
statement, which raises several questions. It is not clear how compatible
'major changes' are with continuing support for Mr Rooney, a co-founder of
the company and still its dominating force.
Mr Rooney has said he would be prepared to give up the role of chairman or
chief executive, but not both. Mr Rooney and his family trusts have a 16 per
cent stake in the company.
Pre-tax profits in the first half of the current year were forecast to be
well below the comparable period, contrary to earlier expectations. In March
the company disclosed a pre-tax loss of Pounds 26m - a third less than
expected.
CORRECTION
Spring Ram made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 26m last year. The incorrect
reference yesterday to a loss was due to an editing error.

FT  15 JUL 93 / World Trade News: Italian export insurance for review -
Tighter guidelines will follow corruption charges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN A little-noticed move, the Italian Treasury has decided to carry out a
thorough review of the operations of Sace, the state-run export insurance
agency with total exposure of L52,266bn (Pounds 22.25bn).
The outcome is likely to have a profound impact on the way Italian exports
are given cover. In future Sace - or its replacement - will operate on much
tighter guidelines with more overtly financial criteria and less subject to
the strong-arm of the politicians.
Sace has operated with a great degree of discretion and has been deeply
beholden to political masters. This has been exposed in recent months by its
involvement in the corruption scandals that have led in turn to a complete
overhaul of the agency's board.
Mr Roberto Ruberti, head of Sace, is still in jail after being arrested on
March 11 on charges of corruption. Two other senior Sace executives were
arrested, along with three other figures linked to the export credit
business. Mr Ruberti, a former member of the Bank of Italy, is alleged to
have received payment in return for providing Sace cover for overseas
Italian contracting operations.
These developments prompted the Treasury to move in and take a closer look
at Sace, while also guaranteeing the normality of the agency's operations.
Rome magistrates are understood to be examining a series of suspect
insurance deals, especially in the Caribbean, between 1983-88. Some Dollars
300m-Dollars 400m (Pounds 200m-Pounds 270m) is involved.
Until the magistrates have clarified matters, the Treasury cannot approve
formal settlement of the suspect operations. As a result the Treasury is
expected to establish an escrow account to assure creditors they will be
paid.
Even without the damage caused by being caught up in the corruption
scandals, Sace was in need of a reappraisal. Questions have been building up
for years about how far the Treasury should be funding indemnity payments
and over the slim size of premiums. There have also been demands for a
better definition of the types of country risk available for Sace cover, as
well as new guidelines on the agency's role in backing overseas aid
projects. The latter area is where some of the worst abuses are believed to
have occurred.
The Treasury has handed out over L3,360bn in the past two years to assist
Sace pay-out indemnity claims and L1,400bn more is likely this year. The
level of indemnities is believed to have peaked in 1992, the large recent
amounts reflecting problems dating back to 1983-90. These losses relate
primarily to the Latin American debt crisis, exposure in Egypt and problems
arising from political change in east Europe - notably the former Soviet
Union, ex-Yugoslavia and Poland.
The need for such Treasury support stems more from low premiums than from
the income received from credits recovered. Since Sace was established in
1977 premiums have slipped from covering over 80 per cent of indemnities to
under 10 per cent. The ratio of recoveries to indemnities is over 60 per
cent.
Since 1990 tighter methods of control have been in operation; but only now
are the authorities recognising that Sace has conducted insurance cover on
far too discretionary a basis. Thus one of the main tasks of the commission
will be to provide a set of ground rules for transparent operations judging
risk both by country and by business sector.
A more sensitive issue concerns future Sace policy towards covering
investments regarded as strategic in risk countries. This is especially
important for Italy, which depends almost wholly on energy imports whose
cost has to be offset by an aggressive export policy. Successive governments
have thus encouraged big trade and project finance deals with the energy
suppliers. The most notable examples are trade and investment deals to
offset the cost of Algerian and Soviet gas.
Between them, Algeria and the former Soviet states account for L15,000bn
(split in roughly equal parts) of Sace's cover - nearly 30 per cent of all
long-term commitments. Much of the L7,000bn Sace cover for Algeria embraces
trade and investment related to building a second under-the-Mediterranean
gas pipeline. Nevertheless, at present these countries would not necessarily
come within the ambit of stricter criteria for Sace coverage - either in
terms of political risk or because of non-payment of debts.
The Treasury commission will therefore have to decide whether such strategic
investments are determined by reasons of state or by purely commercial
considerations. If the former, then cover will have to be arranged in a
different way - for instance, guaranteed direct by the Treasury or backed by
special collateral.
A pointer is the current negotiations between ENI, the state oil concern,
and Gazprom for a Dollars 1.8bn contract to modernise and upgrade the
Russian federation's gas pipe network. Here the Italians want a commodity
collateral in gas or oil. Only when the collateral has been finalised will
the Sace cover of Dollars 1.6bn be forthcoming.

THE Banco de Portugal lost Es81.8bn (Dollars 531m) in 1992 as it spent
heavily to shore up the escudo and mop up liquidity in the domestic money
market, according to the central bank's annual report.
Only the transfer of Es71bn in reserves enabled the bank to record an
official loss of Es9.8bn for 1992, the report said. This was the bank's
first loss. The report said the bank had suffered losses since 1988 that had
been covered by transferring provisions.
In the autumn of 1992, the escudo came under strong speculative pressure and
the bank was forced to spend foreign currency reserves on escudos at prices
above the level to which the currency fell after a 6 per cent devaluation in
November.

FT  14 JUL 93 / International Company News: Sales at Roche rise 8%

<TEXT>
ROCHE, the Swiss healthcare and chemicals group, yesterday reported sales
for the first six months up 8 per cent to SFr7.15bn (Dollars 5.1bn) from
SFr6.62bn. In local currencies the increase was 10 per cent. The company
does not publish half-year profit figures.
The company said it expected sales to continue to improve during the second
half of the year and that barring unforeseen circumstances, particularly in
foreign exchange rates, the group should post a significant increase on last
year's net income of SFr1.9bn.
Much of the first-half growth was generated by the pharmaceuticals division
which reported sales up 12 per cent to SFr1.59bn from SFr1.56bn. Excluding
exchange rates, the increase was 14 per cent.
The company said the German healthcare reforms introduced in January - which
have led to a 13 per cent fall in the market for the first four months - had
little impact. Turnover in Italy during the first half improved in spite of
the fall in the market following reforms introduced in April. Roche said it
expected sales in both Italy and Germany to increase this year.
The vitamins and fine chemicals unit lifted sales 2 per cent to SFr1.59bn
from SFr1.56bn. Roche said the vitamins business performed well. But the
division's results were held up by fine chemicals, and in particular the
manufacture of one agrochemical fungicide without which sales would have
been up 5 per cent.
The diagnostics division posted turnover up 8 per cent to SFr867m from
SFr799m. The business profited from the introduction of PCR (polymerase
chain reaction) technology for HIV and Chlymidia, which had been well

Sales of the fragrances and flavours division increased 4 per cent to
SFr749m from SFr723m.
Fragrances suffered from poor demand from the luxury perfume sector.
Flavours were not affected by the recession and continued to post increases.

FT  14 JUL 93 / IRI plans telecoms sector merger
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
IRI, Italy's biggest state holding company, yesterday revealed plans to
rationalise the telecommunications sector, starting with the merger of Sip
and Italcable by the end of this year.
Sip is Italy's main telecoms utility, while Italcable handles
intercontinental traffic. Both companies are quoted.
The union will be the first step towards grouping Italy's public sector
telecoms activities, split between seven main companies, into a single
concern. The new organisation, expected to be called Telecom Italia, should
be operational by 1995-96, by which time the entire sector could be largely
privatisated.
Pressure for rationalisation and privatisation has come from the government
and IRI itself. IRI's new management, facing a cash crisis, has identified
telecoms, controlled by the Stet holding company, obvious privatisation
candidate.
Last night, Stet announced it was issuing a L565bn Eurolira bond,
convertible into Sip savings shares, in a further step in the slow
privatisation process. The deal could cut Stet's stake in Sip savings shares
from 32 to 18 per cent.
The government has set IRI a June 30 deadline to prepare rationalisation
plans. IRI intends to start by merging the main providers of services, while
keeping manufacturing and mobile telecoms apart.
About 40 per cent of Sip's ordinary shares and 47 per cent of those in
Italcable are floating.
Telecom Italia will subsequently absorb Telespazio and Sirm, Stet's
satellite and maritime communications subsidiaries. Telecom Italia will also
comprise Iritel, formerly ASST, the unit responsible for domestic trunk
communications and short-distance international calls.
The future of Stet's equipment manufacturing (Italtel) and network service
(Sirti) businesses is less clear. Stet has been looking for foreign
investors in Italtel, in which AT&amp;T has a 20 per cent stake. Talks with
leading telecoms groups, including the US company, are under way.
The highly profitable mobile telecoms business, run by Sip, will be hived
off into a separate company, in which Telecom Italia will retain a minority
stake. The rest is likely to be floated. Shares in Stet have risen sharply
in recent weeks ahead of bullish forecasts about tariff deregulation and
restructuring. The Italian government hopes to float about 20 per cent of
the IMI financial services group and 30-35 per cent of the big Ina state
insurance company this year. Investors will be able to swap medium and
long-term government bonds for shares in the two companies.

<TEXT>
THE French government plans to give more money to poorer regions of the
country and relatively less to Paris over the next five years in an attempt
to restrain the capital's congestion and economic dominance.
Approximately 10.6m people live in greater Paris, nearly a fifth of the
population. As part of a five-year planwhich it will legislate in the
autumn, the government said this week it aimed to limit the greater Paris
population to 11.8m by the year 2015, and to redeploy up to 30,000 civil
servants to the provinces by the year 2000.
A French appeal court yesterday confirmed a four-year prison sentence on the
former head of the national blood bank, Mr Michel Garretta, for knowingly
distributing Aids-contaminated blood products to haemophiliacs.
The court, ruling after an appeal by former health officials accused of
involvement in France's worst modern health scandal, also confirmed that Mr
Jean-Pierre Allain, ex-director of transfusion research, should serve four
years with two suspended. About 1,250 haemophiliacs were infected over a
period up to the end of 1985. More than 300 have died.

FT  14 JUL 93 / Russia tells Asian states to decide on allegiance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RUSSIA yesterday told the central Asian states of the former Soviet Union to
'choose between north and south' for their economic and political
orientation. The warning was the clearest yet that Russia is not prepared to
tolerate the indiscipline and indecisiveness within the Commonwealth of
Independent States that marked its first 18 months of existence.
Mr Alexander Shokhin, the deputy prime minister, said yesterday that the
recent agreement by Russia, Ukraine and Belarus to form a close economic
union was partly a reaction to the participation by Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan,
Kyrgyzstan and other states in the meeting of the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation convened by Turkey in Istanbul 10 days ago.
Mr Shokhin said that conference decisions to create a customs union and
common market and declare that Armenia was the aggressor in the struggle
with Azerbaijan for control of Nagorno Karabakh were incompatible with
membership of the CIS. The three Slav states of Russia, Ukraine and Belarus
comprise about 80 per cent of the commonwealth's population.
'If our friends in the CIS, in their search for a better life, are looking
towards the south, then they will have to choose between integration with
Russia or with their southern neighbours,' Mr Shokhin said.
He said Mr Nursultan Nazarbayev, the Kazakh president, had given a 'very
weak reason' for participation in the conference, in which he cited Russia's
reluctance to advance credits to Kazakhstan. Mr Shokhin said that Russia had
put aside Rbs800bn in inter-state credits to the CIS members in 1993,
including Rbs150bn for Kazakhstan, but that no agreement had yet been
reached on the use of these funds.
The idea for the agreement between the three Slav states, Mr Shokhin said,
had been worked out largely between Russia and Belarus. However, Ukraine
decided to join because of its concern over the apparent defection of
Kazakhstan. However, Mr Tulegen Zhukeyev, the state adviser to Kazakhstan,
yesterday told the Interfax news agency that the decision to participate in
the conference did not exclude continued participation in the CIS. 'The
markets of these countries are quite comparable and could supplement each
other,' he said.
Mr Zhukeyev said that the idea of forming a closer economic union within the
CIS had been long advocated by Mr Nazarbayev.

FT  14 JUL 93 / Serra to be economy minister
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SPANISH prime minister Felipe Gonzalez yesterday gave his deputy premier
Narcis Serra overall responsibility for economic policy and appointed Mr
Pedro Solbes, a technocrat with an EC background, to head the finance
ministry.
The appointments, which follow last month's narrow election win by Mr
Gonzalez's socialist party (PSOE), were part of a wide-ranging government
reshuffle that brought eight new members into the 17-strong cabinet.
Facing what amounts to Spain's worst recession for 30 years, the new
economic team is unlikely to apply harsh measures to lower wage costs, cut
government spending and deregulate the economy.
Mr Gonzalez excluded representatives of the PSOE's left wing from the
cabinet, gave minor cabinet jobs to six independents, three of them women,
and kept Mr Javier Solana as foreign minister. Mr Solana is, like Mr Serra,
a stalwart of the ruling party's social democrat wing and both ministers
have served in all Mr Gonzalez's governments since 1982.
The challenges facing the new government were underlined by CPI figures
released yesterday. Year on year inflation was up 0.2 per cent to 4.9 per
cent. The rise reflected the impact of the peseta's mid-May devaluation -
the third in the space of nine months - on energy costs.
Mirroring an excessive wage growth that has become one of the economy's
chief weaknesses, underlying inflation, excluding food and energy prices,
rose 0.4 in June to post a year on year figure of 5.9 per cent.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE speaker of the Russian parliament, Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, was
unexpectedly snubbed by the European parliament yesterday after a
cross-party revolt in favour of President Boris Yeltsin.
Mr Khasbulatov, flanked by armed bodyguards, arrived in Strasbourg on Monday
in search of international recognition. The long-planned visit came just
after Mr Yeltsin was feted at the Group of Seven summit in Tokyo.
But the Russian's campaign ran into opposition from MEPs who denounced him
as an enemy of democracy and called for a boycott of all contacts with the
delegation of visiting Russian parliamentarians.
Criticism proved so fierce that Mr Egon Klepsch, president of the European
parliament, cancelled a meeting with Mr Khasbulatov due to take place
yesterday morning. However, a separate meeting between MEPs and the Russian
delegation took place in the afternoon.
Lord Bethell, a British Conservative and long-standing critic of human
rights abuses in the former Soviet Union, led the anti-Khasbulatov campaign
in favour of Mr Yeltsin. 'Our sympathies are with the elected president of
Russia. Khasbulatov is a proven enemy of democracy,' he said.
He was joined by Count Otto von Hapsburg, the German Christian Socialist and
descendant of the imperial family. Mr Khasbulatov was pursuing Communist
goals in league with extremist forces of national bolshevism, he said.
The European parliament invited members of the Russian parliament to come to
Strasbourg as part of its expanding contacts with legislatures in the former
Communist countries of eastern and central Europe.
Mrs Magdalene Hoff, a German SPD member of the parliament, defended the
invitation. 'We are not under any illusions here. But I believe in dialogue,
not monologue.'

FT  14 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A LACK of vitality continued to prevail in stock index futures, although the
September contract on the FT-SE 100 did manage to muster a steady day's
trading, writes Christine Buckley.
The contract opened at 2,841 and closed at 2,845. It weakened to 2,835 about
half an hour into trading before finding an upward path. The day's high came
at 3pm when it nudged 2,852, but the syndrome of dealers selling when the
2,850 level is breached struck again and the last hour saw a 7-point
decline.
Volume was respectable at 7,069 contracts and activity was stimulated by the
better than expected factory output figures, which spread optimism for the
longer term recovery outlook. That activity was, however, tempered by the
double-edged element to the output figures - the fading hopes for interest
rate cuts.
One trader also felt the slight futures revival was helped by investors
returning to the market and creating a bounce after several weak days.
September was 2 points ahead of its fair value premium to cash, which is 7
points.
Traded options moved with conviction and their volume put the previous day's
dismal performance firmly in the shadows. Total volume was 29,437, against
the previous day's 16,553. Index options took the lion's share, with 8,333
lots in the FT-SE 100 and 4,107 in the Euro FT-SE 100.

General and life insurance group Legal &amp; General moved sharply ahead on a
squeeze and positive sentiment from several brokers, ahead of the imminent
publication of new business figures. The stock closed 13 ahead at 500p after
relatively heavy turnover of 2m shares.
Specialists expect the figures to be positive and Charterhouse Tilney
yesterday joined other brokers in reiterating its positive stance on the
stock. The good sentiment in the sector also boosted several other life
stocks. These included London &amp; Manchester, which advanced 10 to 343p, and
Prudential, 4 better at 339p.
Bargain hunters in both General Accident and Commercial Union helped the
shares bounce 9 to 622p and 11 to 615p respectively. Cazenove was also
reported to have recommended both stocks.
In a perky drinks sector, Bass was the outstanding performer, advancing 11
to 460p in good turnover of 3.4m. The shares had fallen heavily at the end
of last week on derisory talk that a promotion by the company's Holiday Inn
subsidiary had sparked a Hoover-type situation. But yesterday Bass was
reassuring the market that the offer - involving discounts for US visitors
to Europe - was going well and the shares responded accordingly.
Storms in the US pushed corn prices higher and cheered Grand Metropolitan,
the shares rising 7 to 415p. Greene King continued to respond to favourable
comment after last week's results, closing 7 to the good at 415p.
The White Paper on Sunday trading had little effect on consumer shares, with
most of those affected already factoring in the government's positive
stance.
Rank Organisation lost 4 to 759p, with Hoare Govett underlining its caution
on the stock ahead of tomorrow's interim figures. The market is forecasting
a range of Pounds 88m to Pounds 94m.
The expectation of a success on the BT3 sale attracted investors to SG
Warburg, the global co-ordinator of the sale. The shares jumped 16 to 734p.
Abbey National gave up 3 to 414p, with SG Warburg Securities said to have
taken the stock off its buy list.
Turnover in conglomerate Tomkins jumped to 10m as several brokers issued
'buy' recommendations on the shares. The stock, which on Monday achieved the
dubious honour of being the biggest faller in the FT-SE 100 Index, after it
reported figures, rallied 6 1/2 to 219p. NatWest Securities said: 'The
continuing cost reductions in RHM should help to ensure good profits growth
over the next two to three years.'
Profit-taking in Lonrho left the shares 3 lighter at 131p.
Water issues were mixed following the publication of the report by
regulatory body Ofwat on water charges. Analysts said the 7 per cent real
return on capital seen as necessary to secure adequate financial ratios in
the sector could imply greater long-term profits in the sector than
previously expected. There was relief that the timescale for costly
improvements is likely to be longer than previously supposed. Among those
staying in positive territory, Northumbrian added 5 at 573p and Yorkshire 7
at 497p.
Strong bargain hunting lifted Tiphook ahead of today's eagerly awaited
figures. The shares gained 12 at 286p.
Solid demand from UK institutions saw British Steel put on 3 at 96 1/2 p in
trade of 7.9m. Continued hopes that an order for Airbus aircraft will be
accompanied by an order for Rolls-Royce engines to power the aircraft
boosted the shares 1 1/2 to 144p.
Worries over its European markets mentioned at the company's annual meeting
hurt Johnson Matthey, discounting a recommendation from Hoare Govett. The
shares eased a penny to 455p.
The Sun's aggressive pricing campaign continued to inflict injuries on its
competitors, with United Newspapers proving the market's main casualty. The
publisher of the Daily Star and Daily Express lost 14 to close at 521p,
while Mirror Group Newspapers dipped 2 to 151p. News International, owner of
The Sun, moved up a penny to 216p.
The successful outcome in the rights issue by Hammerson generated upward
movement in property issues.
The 97 per cent take-up of the Hammerson issue spurred the 'A' shares
upwards by 7 to 305p. British Land appreciated 4 to 337p, Land Securities
also moved up 4, taking it to 586p, and MEPC added 7 at 434p. One specialist
said the take-up was a little better than expected after slight hesitation
that Hammerson's offer would match those from other property companies in a
long series of cash calls.
Investors were unmoved by Great Portland Estates' plans to review its
relationship with its managing agents after negative press reports on the
arrangement. Its share price had moved ahead a penny to 173p in early
trading on the Hammerson wave and stuck at that level after the plan was
announced at the company's annual meeting.
A buy note from James Capel stirred up brisk activity in Taylor Woodrow,
which moved forward 5 to 100p in volume of 3m.
In textiles, Jacques Vert, the women's fashions designer and retailer,
strengthened 13 to 100p on the back of a bounce in profits and a large
increase in the dividend.
Sherwood Group dropped 11 to 136p. Recent downgradings and fears over its
lace sales in Europe and performances in its sock division were blamed.

Positive news from Taiwan, along with the upgrading of profits expectations
by BZW, once again led to strong demand for British Aerospace, sending the
stock up a further 7 to 427p.
As speculation continued about a lucrative order for Airbus Industrie, in
which it has a 20 per cent holding, demand for the stock was boosted by news
that Taiwan's Economics Ministry and a local banking consortium had agreed
on financing for the planned regional jets venture with BAe.
Sentiment was further enhanced by BZW, which increased its estimate of
current year profits by Pounds 30m to Pounds 125m. It also raised the
following year's forecast by Pounds 30m to Pounds 235m. The 1995 prediction
is now at the top of the range. BZW cited the improvement of sales at Rover
Group, BAe's carmaking subsidiary, for the change.

The recent run of successful market debuts came to a sudden halt as shares
in Court Cavendish, the nursing home company, closed at a hefty discount to
their 225p issue price, which had valued the company at Pounds 51m.
Dealers blamed a number of factors for the drop, which saw the shares open
at 210p and drift back to 204p, before finishing at 207p. Turnover came to
1.6m.
One factor cited was the Pounds 33m cash call made last week by rival
operator Crestacare, with institutions which would have given the Court
shares more support holding back until the allocation of the rights issue is
known. In April, Westminster Health Care completed a Pounds 63m rights
issue.
Another rumour being heard was that Takare, the nursing home market leader,
would also return to shareholders for a cash injection in the autumn. Takare
shares were steady at 240p, Westminster a penny ahead at 297p and Crestacare
level at 43p.

REPORTS OF an aggressive pricing campaign by Procter and Gamble, the US
household chemicals group, hurt Unilever and the shares tumbled 25 to 977p
in hefty turnover of 4.7m. It was the stock's lowest level since
mid-September last year.
Analysts said the reports emanating from the US suggested that P &amp; G, which
had mounted a vociferous promotion strategy on its detergents, had now
decided to extend the campaign in North America and incorporate other
products in its detergents range. With margins already squeezed in the
detergents business, the P &amp; G move is seen as an escalation of an already
difficult situation.

<TEXT>
A NUMBER of programme trades, said to have been weighted to the buy side,
plus some highly encouraging economic data and another resolute opening
performance by Wall Street, helped London's equity market regain its
composure yesterday.
The FT-SE 100 Index ended a net 6.2 up at 2,837.1, while the FT-SE Mid 250
Index did little more than mark time, closing only 1.4 firmer at 3,230.0.
But the view around some of the City's dealing desks was that yesterday's
performance may well have been no more than a technical bounce, after the
near 70-point fall since the start of the month, and that the market's rally
might well be followed by a more severe sell-off.
Wall Street's steady showing on Monday saw London off to a bright start with
the FT-SE 100 opening almost two points higher, and after a brief flurry of
selling pressure which took the Footsie down to a net decline of 3.4 at one
point, it traded in positive territory for the rest of the day.
Sentiment was given a strong boost in mid-morning by news that industrial
prod-uction during May had risen by 2 per cent, month on month, compared
with market expectations of an increase in the region of 0.5 per cent, and
3.9 per cent on the year.
'The 2 per cent rise is a big number and shows that the recovery is in
place,' said Mr Robin Aspinall at Panmure Gordon, the stockbroker. He added
that the market was now getting keyed up for today's inflation figures for
June and tomorrow's unemployment numbers.
After a brief period of reflection on the output numbers, the market
gradually moved up a gear, with dealers reporting an increased willingness
by the big institutions to get involved in the market. 'After the news, it
felt much better and the institutions were happy to sort out some of their
positions,' noted one marketmaker.
Another view in the market was that the output figures, which were seen as
confirming the economic recovery, could well have reduced the chances of a
cut in UK interest rates in the short term, a view reinforced by sterling's
show of strength late in the session.
Turnover, which struggled at minimal levels during the early part of the
day, picked up as the session drew to a close, finishing at 592.4m shares.
This was well up from Monday's 448.1m shares which, as brokers gloomily
reported, provided customer business worth only Pounds 796.2m.
The value of daily retail business, commonly above the Pounds 1bn mark since
the second half of last year, has contracted sharply in the last two weeks.
The value of customer business dropped below Pounds 1bn on two days last
week and threatens to do so this week.
Next Monday will see a dramatic transformation in customer turnover,
however, with trading in BT3 certain to give activity levels a very strong
boost.
BT was among the more active stocks yesterday and continued to underperform
the market as bearish circulars from two broking houses, Kleinwort Benson
and Carr Kitcat &amp; Aitken, continued to unsettle nerves.
There was no nervousness surrounding shares in SG Warburg, which raced
higher on the prospect of hefty fees and commission income generated by the
merchant bank's handling of the BT3 flotation.

FT  14 JUL 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Roche takes Zurich to a high
for 1993
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FRANKFURT quietened a little, more in share price than in turnover terms,
but there were pockets of good performance elsewhere, writes Our Markets
Staff.
ZURICH rose again on a good progress report from Roche, and further strength
in banks. The SMI index rose 10.1 to 2,419.0, a new closing high for the
year.
Roche's 8 per cent rise in first half sales took in 14 per cent local
currency growth in pharmaceuticals and a strong performance in diagnostics,
said Mr Mark Tracey at Goldman Sachs, which has revised its earnings
forecasts from SFr273 to SFr284 a share for 1993, and from SFr324 to SFr346
for 1994. The certificates rose SFr40 to SFr5,170.
In banks, UBS bearers added SFr22 to SFr1,185, and CS Holding SFr40 to
SFr2,895.
AMSTERDAM slipped back a little at the close as some profits were locked in
and the dollar weakened. The CBS Tendency index slipped 0.4 to 116.9, after
an earlier high of 117.6.
Cyclical stocks continued to attract interest, although most fell back from
their intraday peaks. Hoogovens, which crossed the Fl 41 barrier at one
stage, closed down 10 cents at Fl 39.20, and DSM, up to Fl 101.20 during the
session, retreated Fl 1.50 to Fl 97.80 at the close.
Goldman Sachs has recently recommended taking an overweight position in
Dutch cyclicals, generating interest particularly from US and UK investors.
However, Amsterdam brokers, Pierson, believe that it is still too earlier to
take a position in cyclicals, given forecasts of economic recovery no sooner
that the end of 1994. The brokers also comment that the recent gains in DSM
have been overdone, as it does not expect the chemicals group to pay a
dividend when it announces results later this month.
KLM rose Fl 1.20 or 4 per cent to Fl 30.70 helped by a good recent
performance in Lufthansa and expectations of progress in its cooperation
talks with other European operators.
Unilever lost Fl 3.70 to Fl 197.50 on news that competitor Proctor &amp; Gamble
was expected to cut the price on some of its products.
PARIS fell back towards the close. Uncertainty prevailed as to whether the
Bundesbank would cut interest rates this week. The CAC-40 index ended down
1.07 at 1,991.15, having breached the 2,000 level during the session.
Turnover was FFr3bn.
The French market is closed today for Bastille Day. Most analysts expect the
franc to weather the current crisis in the currency markets, and there was
less pressure seen on the currency yesterday.
Valeo was one of the day's strongest performers in high volume on rumours of
a possible financial restructuring, the shares adding FFr35 or 4 per cent to
FFr884. Its holding company, Cerus, gained FFr3.60 to FFr88.20.
Casino improved FFr4.00 to FFr146.90 on reports that it might be about to
sell a US division.
FRANKFURT fell on profit taking, but its losses were relatively light at
blue chip level and the DAX index stayed above 1,800 at the close, ending
11.01 lower at 1,807.16.
Turnover eased from DM10.6bn to DM9.7bn. There was no obvious pressure on
cyclicals, a recent support for the market. Indeed, Daimler only fell DM2 to
DM664 after Monday's DM16 gain and, in steels, Thyssen actually rose DM1.30
to DM206.80.
However, there were pockets of punishment, mostly lower down the size scale
where illiquidity has persisted. In chemicals, for example, Rutgerswerke
dropped DM23, or 7.2 per cent to DM296.
Meanwhile, the German depression was reflected in a warning of worsening
business from Linotype, the printing technology company; its shareholders
paid, too, with a fall of DM40, or 8.3 per cent to DM440.
MILAN was largely dominated by technical trading as options expired. The
market is expected to remain subdued aheads of tomorrow's close of the
monthly account. The Comit index eased 0.27 to 545.73.
Stet put on L16 to L3,646 at the fix, and moved on to L3,790 on the kerb as
foreign interest in the telecommunications sector continued to develop.
There are rumours that Stet is planning a L600bn bond issue, convertible
into Sip savings shares. Sip was L14 higher at L2,704 and L2,725 in after
hours trading.
BRUSSELS ended at a record high for the third consecutive day Tuesday, the
Bel-20 index climbing 10.21 to 1,328.54.
STOCKHOLM's rally accelerated with the Affarsvarlden index gaining 7.0 to
1,134.6. Turnover advanced to SKr947m from SKr755m. Demand for Ericsson B
shares continued, rising SKr1 to SKr353. Telecommunications also featured in
HELSINKI where Nokia put on FM6 to FM213 and the HEX index gained 11.7 to
1,257.2.
TEL AVIV rebounded after a week of losses on a Bank of Israel interest rate
cut, the blue chip index rising 5.23, or 2.8 per cent to 191.84.

FT  14 JUL 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Inflation news fails to lift
equity sentiment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
GOOD NEWS on inflation failed to lift stock market sentiment yesterday, and
prices ended little changed in thin summer trading, writes Patrick Harverson
in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 8.94 down at 3,515.44. The Standard
&amp; Poor's 500 eased 0.89 to 448.09, while the Nasdaq composite firmed 0.80 to
708.47. Trading volume on the New York SE amounted to 237m shares.
Although the morning's news on inflation - the June producer prices index
fell by 0.3 per cent - was bullish for equities, investors appeared
uninterested in the data.
Dealers attributed the lack of a more positive reaction to two factors:
firstly, that the markets had expected a good PPI number, so it was already
priced into stocks; secondly, that investors and dealers may have been
slightly disappointed at the 0.1 per cent decline in the 'core' PPI, which
excludes the volatile food and energy components of the headline PPI.
Analysts had been looking for a bigger decline in the core measure.
Share markets may also have been disappointed by the lack of a move upwards
in bond prices. By early afternoon the Treasury market had shrugged off the
PPI data, and the benchmark 30-year bond was down slightly, yielding 6.625
per cent.
The first batch of second-quarter corporate earnings began to arrive in
earnest yesterday. Among the busiest sectors was the brokerage stocks.
Merrill Lynch reported record quarterly profits of 345m, which temporarily
lifted the shares to an all-time high of Dollars 86 1/8 . Profit-takers then
moved in and the selling pushed Merrill's stock to an early afternoon low of
Dollars 84 5/8 , at which it closed, down Dollars 1 on the day.
PaineWebber, another big Wall Street securities house, also met
profit-taking, losing Dollars  1/8 at Dollars 29 in spite of another strong
quarter, with profits climbing 30 per cent to Dollars 59.3m. Finally, Bear
Stearns firmed Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 23 1/2 on news that Mr James Cayne,
its president, has been appointed to the additional post of chief executive.
Home Shopping Network was the market's most heavily traded stock for the
second day running, rising Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 14 3/4 in volume of 3.9m
shares as investors continued to react favourably to news of a merger offer
from rival QVC Network. QVC, traded on the Nasdaq market, jumped a further
Dollars 3 3/4 to Dollars 71 1/2 .
Motorola climbed Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars 89 1/4 following the company's
announcement, late on Monday, of a 57 per cent increase in second-quarter
profits to Dollars 224m.
Hilton Hotels retreated Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 44 3/4 after reporting a 17
per cent decline in second-quarter profits to Dollars 26.8m and warning that
the remainder of the year would be 'challenging' for the company.
Canada
TORONTO stocks also traded within a narrow range and closed with mixed
movements, although turnover was fairly heavy.
The TSE 300 index was finally up 1.2 at 3,951.7, while declining issues held
a slight edge over rises by 365 to 354. Volume totalled 59.1m shares valued
at CDollars 664m.
Among the sub-indices, golds lost 0.92 per cent as the New York gold bullion
price eased 25 US cents an ounce.

FT  14 JUL 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Election hopes push
Nikkei above 20,000

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HOPES OF a further stimulus to the economy after elections to the lower
house took the Nikkei average to a close above 20,000 for the first time
since June 15, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The index rose for the third consecutive day, ending 200.42, or 1 per cent,
higher at 20,180.42. It registered a low for the day of 19,967.60 at the
beginning of the session; but institutional and individual investors bought
interest rate-sensitive issues on hopes of lower interest rates, while
arbitrage-related demand during the last half-hour of trading pushed it up
to a high of 20,243.02.
Volume rose to 320m shares from 229m. Advances led falls by 825 to 190, with
127 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks put on
21.63 at 1,635.31 and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index firmed 1.75 to
1,244.73.
Aside from arbitrage-related buying, which had led trading in recent days,
traders said banks and some life assurers were buying interest
rate-sensitive issues. Mr Chris Newton at James Capel commented: 'Some
investors are starting to believe that the market will firm after the
weekend elections.'
Interest rate-sensitive financial issues were higher on hopes of monetary
easing. Industrial Bank of Japan moved ahead Y90 to Y3,150 and Bank of Tokyo
Y90 to Y1,660. Traders said the Long Term Credit Bank's decision to end its
financial support for EIE International, the unlisted property developer,
prompted hopes that other banks will follow suit in cutting off
restructuring support.
Companies linked to EIE International drew heavy selling orders. Sea-Com,
listed on the second section, closed at an offered price of Y385, down Y80,
and Electronic &amp; International Enterprises closed on the over-the-counter
market at an offer price of Y850, a fall of Y100.
Interest rate-sensitive, large-capital stocks were firm, Nippon Steel adding
Y9 at Y372 and Kawasaki Steel Y4 at Y341.
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone jumped Y37,000 to Y915,000, regaining the
Y900,000 level for the first time since June 24.
In Osaka, the OSE average rose 230.68 to 22,188.90 in volume of 16.2m
shares. The index advanced for the fourth consecutive trading day, exceeding
the 22,000 level for the first time since June 16.
Roundup
DISCERNIBLE trends were hard to find among the region's markets yesterday as
a general period of consolidation took hold.
HONG KONG ended marginally higher, supported by the banking and utilities
sectors. The Hang Seng index gained 3.51 at 6,956.10.
Property issues were sold partly on fears that mainland investors might sell
holdings because of China's tightened credit policies. Cheung Kong retreated
50 cents to HKDollars 25.60 and Henderson Land 20 cents to HKDollars 20.90.
SEOUL was lower for the third straight session on institutional selling. The
composite index lost 6.13 to 762.94 in turnover down to Won478bn from
Monday's Won505bn.
Lucky-Goldstar group shares went against the trend on an announcement that
the group planned to sell eight subsidiaries and merge five units by the end
of 1995. Goldstar Instrument and Electric rose Won400 to Won22,900.
TAIWAN continued its downward trend in the absence of positive news. The
weighted index fell 65.53, or 1.6 per cent, to 4,013.18. Turnover came to
TDollars 17.2bn, against TDollars 16.3bn.
AUSTRALIA was supported by brisk trading in Woolworths, but easier gold
shares later in the day dampened sentiment. The All Ordinaries index
finished a net 2.4 up at 1,804.2. The golds index receded 8 full points to
2,215.7.
About 17.4m Woolworths shares were traded after Monday's ADollars 2.5bn
flotation, and the stock lost a cent at ADollars 2.80 after reaching
ADollars 2.83 earlier.
NEW ZEALAND retreated from Monday's three-year high to close slightly lower.
The NZSE-40 index slipped 3.12 to 1,723.73 in a turnover of NZDollars 767m.
KARACHI ended sharply higher after a positive round of meetings between
President Ghulam Ishaq Khan and Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif lifted
sentiment. The KSE index rose 15.67 to 1,259.85.

FT  14 JUL 93 / World Stock Markets: Indian foreign initiative reaps limited
rewards - A disappointing inflow of orders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
  By RC MURTHY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
India's securities scandal is only one reason why, nine months since the
market was opened to foreign portfolio investment, there has been a flood of
enquiries but no big inflow of orders.
So far, less than Dollars 20m has come in, disappointing the Securities and
Exchange Board of India, the market watchdog which also keeps track of
capital flows.
For decades, foreigners were kept out of India, by official fiat; and last
September, when foreign investors were given permission to hold up to 5 per
cent of quoted Indian companies, they were discouraged by archaic trading
practices, and share prices which moved more on rumours than on facts and
fundamentals.
No official target was set for foreign involvement. The authorities in New
Delhi were hoping for Dollars 2bn in foreign direct capital inflow,
including Dollars 1bn of portfolio investment, this year; but even this
objective is proving as tough as Mount Everest to scale.
Mr Stephen Barnes, at the Bombay office of BZW, says: 'One should talk of
hundreds of millions, not billions', for the next couple of years.
It will be a long haul at this rate for overseas investors to reach their 5
per cent quota, which works out to Rp58bn (Dollars 1.84bn), taking the
market capitalisation of the top half of the 650 companies listed on the
Bombay Stock Exchange.
Foreign fund managers have had a lot of bad news to contend with. Early last
December they were pondering the outbreak of communal riots, triggered by
the destruction of the Babri mosque at Ayodhya.
Subsequent events have included pre-budget blues in February; a series of
bomb blasts on March 12, which upset commercial activity in major Indian
cities; and, finally, the bombshell dropped last month by Mr Harshad Mehta,
the stockbroker at the centre of India's Rp50bn securities scandal, alleging
a Rp10m pay-off to Mr PV Narisimha Rao, the Indian prime minister, who
denied the accusation.
The stock market has reacted bearishly. The BSE 30-share index hit its
14-month low of 2,036 at the end of April, down by 55 per cent from the peak
of 4,500 a year ago.
A ban on short sales by BSE authorities last month took the bears' teeth
away, but share prices have since moved in a narrow range, the index closing
yesterday at 2,187.81 after a downward flutter on Monday.
Foreign investors now have a feel for the environment. They are able to
identify quite a few companies with price/earnings multiples of less than
25, and this makes an attractive change.
The market was governed until recently by Mr Mehta's theory that p/e ratios
were less important in valuing companies than the cost of replacing existing
assets. On this basis, ACC, India's biggest cement producer, was bought up
to Rp10,000 in April 1992. It is now down to a realistic Rp1,660 and a p/e
of just under 19.
Fundamentals have improved. Inflation is running at a six-year low of 5.8
per cent per annum; and interest rates at commercial banks are down by 2
percentage points over the past four months and are poised to fall further.
Monsoon rains this season so far have been timely, and evenly spread
throughout the country. If the weathermen's predictions come true,
agricultural production will see strong growth, laying the foundation for a
sharp rise in gross national product this year.
The stock market has now focused on around half a dozen companies with
strong fundamentals, such as ICICI, the finance house, Great Eastern
Shipping, SCICI (basically shipping finance) and the Housing Development
Finance Corporation, all of which are in the p/e range of 9 to 17.
Foreigners have devised a dual strategy, testing the market with small
orders and then striking bilateral deals with local institutional investors.
'It is possible to get discounts on large orders,' says Mr Barnes,
justifying the bilateral approach.
On the sell side, the Unit Trust of India is interested in selling part of
its portfolio because it needs to generate Rp50bn in cash to service
dividends in July.
Mr P Sankaran, of Ind-Global Financial Services, expects the tempo of
foreign portfolio investment to accelerate over the next two months, if
there is no major setback to the equity market over the same period. 'The
immediate problem,' emphasises Mr Sankaran, 'is political stability.'

FT  14 JUL 93 / Money Markets: French rates unsettled
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHANIE FLANDERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE uncertainty surrounding the franc continued to unsettle the outlook for
French money market rates yesterday, writes Stephanie Flanders.
In a widely expected move, the Bundesbank yesterday set a variable 14-day
repo tender, switching back from last week's fixed rate pact. Traders now
expect the German central bank to allow some fall from last week's 7.30 per
cent rate, in order to support the French authorities.
Few traders now consider a cut in the German Lombard or discount rates to be
very likely tomorrow, especially since the pressure on the franc seems to
have lost some of its earlier momentum.
Once again, French money market rates caught some of the uncertainty.
Three-month rates ended at around 7.50 per cent, down from the previous
close of 7.87 per cent. Earlier, trading had taken rates as low as 7.37 per
cent.
Some considered the fall in three-month money to reflect a realisation that
there was little sense expecting France to increase interest rates at
present, given the country's economic weakness.
This view was supported in a poll taken by IDEA, the London-based financial
information company, showing that 78 per cent of the dealers polled did not
think that the French would raise interest rates.
The Bank of England took the sting out of a moderate Pounds 900m shortfall
in early round discount market dealing. The remaining shortage took somewhat
longer to despatch, with the markets trading at close to 6 per cent
throughout the day. Overnight rates conformed with this pattern, at 5 7/8
per cent.
Further out, the London money markets reacted with guarded optimism to the
favourable domestic output figures announced in the morning. The 2 per cent
rise in May industrial production and 1.8 per cent increase in manufacturing
output were significantly higher than pre-dicted. Although wary of reading
too much into one, possibly rogue, figure, traders felt that the data had
dented hopes of an imminent cut in interest rates.
'Optimists have looked forward with almost tunnel vision to a cut in rates,
no matter what,' said one London trader. 'It is healthy that this has been
punctured, but one output figure does not change the belief that rates will
eventually fall.'

FT  14 JUL 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Lull in French franc drama
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHANIE FLANDERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALL EYES were on the French franc when the European markets opened
yesterday, but those expecting high drama were disappointed, writes
Stephanie Flanders.
The currency was still weak in early European trading, but was able to
fluctuate between FFr3.410 and FFr3.415 to the D-Mark for most of the day
without any concerted effort by speculators to take it lower. The franc
ended at FFr3.414, slightly better than Monday's close of FFr3.416.
The only visible move by either the French or the German authorities was the
Bundesbank's announcement of a variable repo rate for today's German market
trading. This had been widely expected, leaving the markets to wait to see
whether the German central bank would ease policy in the coming days.
Most traders thought that there would have been little point in further
interventions yesterday by the Bank of France or the Bundesbank. This was
because pressure on the franc was not at a critical point where strategic
defensive purchases by the authorities could turn a currency's prospects
around. If anything, speculators were suspending judgment on the franc until
later in the week.
'What we are seeing is the same old war of attrition between the markets and
the authorities,' said Ms Alison Cottrell at Midland Global Markets. Many
traders expect the Bundesbank to reduce the repo rate tomorrow by 4 to 5
basis points, but Ms Cottrell does not think that many traders are lining up
to make dramatic assaults on the franc before the Bundesbank council meeting
tomorrow. 'There is too much chance of getting one's fingers burnt,' she
said.
Sterling received an unexpected boost yesterday from favourable domestic
output figures released during the morning. Immediately following the
announcement, the British currency gained more than a pfennig against the
D-Mark, and it closed even higher at DM2.5700, against the previous day's
DM2.5550 finish. It was also strong against the dollar, climbing more than 1
1/2 cents to close at Dollars 1.4935, against Dollars 1.4780 previously.
Meanwhile, the dollar had lost ground during the day, thanks to some
relaxing of tensions within the ERM and official data showing a surprise 0.3
per cent decline in US wholesale prices for June.
'The US data showed that concerns about an imminent tightening by the
Federal Reserve were misplaced,' said Mr Julian Callow of Kleinwort Benson
in London. 'This has taken some of the gloss off the dollar, but the
knowledge that European rates are set to fall makes a bigger fall against
the D-Mark unlikely.' The US unit closed at DM1.7200, down from Monday's
DM1.7285. In New York it ended at DM1.7185.
The Danish krone suffered alongside the French currency. Dealers in Denmark
said they did not expect central bank intervention unless the krone fell to
its floor.

FT  14 JUL 93 / Survey of Birmingham and West Midlands (7): A good place to
be - Inward investment has been impressive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEWART DALBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The 1980s was a good decade for inward investment inthe West Midlands, a
region covering the shire counties of Shropshire, Staffordshire, Hereford,
Worcester and Warwickshire, and the seven metropolitan areas of Birmingham,
Coventry, Dudley, Sandwell, Solihull, Walsall and Wolverhampton.
When the West Midlands Development Agency (WMDA) was established in 1984 it
was attracting 4 per cent of total inward foreign investment to the UK
(measured in terms of projects). By 1990 the West Midlands was drawing 24
per cent of the UK total - a level matched only by Wales. Nearly 900 foreign
companies had invested a cumulative total of Pounds 1bn in the area.
Domestic relocations and expansions are more difficult to quantify because
the WMDA deals only with foreign investment. But Mr Chris Tillett, senior
economist at Coopers &amp; Lybrand in Birmingham, estimates that the foreign
investment would easily have been matched by domestic relocations, start-ups
and expansions.
Telford, a new town corporation until 1991, was at the forefront in
attracting foreign companies. Using liberal government financing and
aggressive marketing it attracted 120 foreign companies into the town - and
1000 relocations or start-ups.
Thirty-three of these companies came from the US, including Johnson Controls
and Fruit of the Loom. Twenty-four were Japanese, including NEC Technology
and Makita, a power tools concern.
Other parts of the West Midlands also did well. In Wolverhampton, the
Connecticut-based Elm Energy and Recycling is building a Dollars 86m waste
tyre to energy power station.
The investments have not been confined to manufacturing. Barclays Bank set
up a back office operation in Coventry employing 700 people. The TSB has
established a presence in Birmingham itself - also employing about 700
people.
New investment has either created or protected more than 100,000 jobs.
The West Midlands is an intermediate development area, and therefore it
qualifies for regional selective assistance from the UK Government and
funding from some of the European Community programmes. But apart from
Telford and Redditch in Hereford and Worcester there has been no extra aid
in the form of generously funded specialised bodies such as the Welsh
Development Agency or Locate in Scotland.
The attractions have been: good central location in the middle of the UK;
and the perception of a skilled labour force and the availability of modern
greenfield, B1 light-industrial factories and offices. While manufacturing
and new high-technology industries have gone, on the whole, to business
parks, some attached to the six universities in the area (such as Warwick
University outside Coventry and Aston University in Birmingham), service
industries have found abundant office space in Birmingham.
Plenty of space remains. The Telford Development Agency says it has 1,000
acres of industrial space outstanding. Only 60 per cent of the 150 acre
Birmingham Business Park has been occupied, and other business areas are
being established.
Filling the space, however, looks like being a more difficult struggle than
in the past. Recession has hit relocations, just as it has affected other
industries. Although figures for inward foreign investment for 1992 have not
been officially released, Mr Tillett estimates that the West Midlands share
of the cake dropped to 13 per cent (measured by number of projects).
Domestic relocations probably slumped more severely, he thinks, because
fewer companies moved out of the hard pressed south-east.
But even without recession the 1990s were bound to be harder because
competition for investment both domestically and internationally is becoming
more intense.
Mr David Rogerson, chief executive of the Telford Development Agency, says:
'A lot of the big US and Japanese companies wanted to be in Europe before
the single market of 1992. These large investments are not going to come
along again. It is now a question of finding smaller companies from places
like Taiwan.'
The British government is redrawing the regional assistance map. There is a
distinct possibility that Telford will lose its development status and that
areas in the south-east, in Dorset, Kent and East Sussex, will receive
assistance. This will probably mean more development agencies chasing mobile
investment.
Mr Rogerson says: 'At the moment we are competing with about 100 agencies
domestically, and something like 1,000 internationally. When we launch an
initiative in Japan we often find ourselves following a group of Dutch
people around, who stress how well they speak English. English speaking
countries are attractive to Japanese businessmen because they have a low
level of competence in other European languages.'
Mr Tillett agrees with Mr Rogerson. He says: 'Most of the big players such
as Toyota and Nissan are in the UK. The West Midlands needs to continue as a
manufacturing centre because there are not enough service jobs to go round.
It is a question of 'upskilling' and attracting small high-technology
companies and automotive component concerns. These will often be joint
ventures.'
Mr Paul Richards, chief executive of WMDA, agrees that the going is getting
tougher. But he believes that the West Midlands could enjoy another good
decade of inward investment - it will be different kinds of investment.
He says: 'We will be looking for smaller companies which will be involved in
international strategic alliances, technology transfer arrangements, joint
ventures for research. and so on. I believe the diversity of the industry we
have built up will help us. We never got the humdingers, like Toyota, which
went to the east Midlands. But with our skills base we attracted a broad
range of industries from automotive components to electronics to food
processing.'
Great emphasis is placed on attracting automotive components companies -
partly because Toyota, near Derby, will provide a ready market for them.
A favourable sign came last month when Johnson Controls announced that it is
to become the first tenant on the Black Country Development Corporation's
new 115-acre Automotive Component Park. The US-based company is making a
Pounds 10m investment which will create 160 new jobs. The development
corporation is hoping that this move is the first of many.

FT  14 JUL 93 / Survey of Birmingham and West Midlands (8): Need is not
always enough - The region's urban renewal programmes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAZEL DUFFY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Government's efforts to enhance the West Midlands urban canvas sound
generous: two urban development corporations; four City Challenges; a new
Housing Action Trust; Estate Action; City Grant totalling Pounds 8m;
derelict land grant amounting to Pounds 20m.
Such is the heritage of physical neglect, however, and the social problems
associated with a neglected environment, that even this panoply of schemes
cannot transform a highly urban region.
For nearly 200 years, the swathe of towns that grew into the West Midlands
conurbation has been the scene for coal mining, minerals extraction, metal
bashing and manufacturing. They have not just left their scars above the
ground. All the many phases of industrial workings have left their mark
below the surface.
Fortunately, with each new discovery of the horrors that were left by
industry, new methods of dealing successfully with the problem are being
worked out.
In the Black Country, for instance, nearly 2,000 private sector new houses
have been built on reclaimed sites. In the east Birmingham area about 500
new houses have been built or are about to be started; sites are being
prepared for another 500.
In Stoke-on-Trent, a complex of offices, retail, leisure and industrial
development covers part of the once derelict site which was reclaimed for
the Garden Festival. Derelict land in the Stoke ribbon of urban development
has been dealt with steadily over the years. Much of the land, however, has
been greened, because reclamation of land for redevelopment is much more
expensive.
The city is now coming to terms with the urgent need to assemble packages of
land to be made suitable for industry. This will depend on successful deals
being worked out with the owners - which include industry, the utilities and
British Coal.
The motivating factor in restoring derelict and run-down tracts of land is
this need to be able to offer new sites for potential incoming companies,
and for existing companies to expand. While developers keep up pressure to
bite into green belt land, the towns and cities in the region must find
alternative urban sites. Without this land, prospects are poor for towns and
cities being able to provide urban living standards better than now.
Packaging sizeable sites can be a lengthy and costly procedure; existing
users must be bought out and relocated. In the current climate, developers
and financial institutions are sceptical - unreasonably - about the finished
product. The abandonment by the government of the proposed contaminated land
register, at least for the time being, has not allayed the private sector's
fears.
The Black Country Development Corporation, set up in 1987, is finding the
costs of extensive reclamation more than it can afford. Funding has been cut
back sharply in the government squeeze on public spending. Increasingly,
unreclaimed sites are being put up for sale accompanied by a site
investigation report, leaving the developer to carry out the reclamation.
Birmingham Heartlands Development Corporation, set up in 1992 to cover part
of east Birmingham, is likely to adopt a similar course on the site it
bought as part of the Leyland-Daf rescue. The Black Country spine road, now
under way, will provide much better access to sites such as that of the old
Patent Shaft steelworks, once planned as a huge shopping mall redevelopment,
now offered as an automotive components industrial park.
A new spine road in Birmingham Heartlands is expected to get the go-ahead in
late summer - again improving the marketability of sites.
City Challenge schemes in the region were allocated Pounds 29.6m in 1993-94.
City Challenge plans to address the social needs of rundown areas more
deliberately than urban development corporations, whose brief is primarily
property-led.
The regional winners are in the Black Country and Birmingham. City Challenge
is concentrated in the most deprived neighbourhoods. To be a deprived area,
however, does not necessarily lead to the five year City Challenge status
and Pounds 37.5m from the Department of the Environment. Coventry and Dudley
were losers in the second and (for the present) last round of City
Challenge, despite putting in bids for severely deprived neighbourhoods.
Coventry has succeeded in getting a Pounds 2.6m slice of the new Urban
Partnership fund which will enable two developments in one of the
unsuccessful City Challenge wards - a ward which recorded an unemployment
rate of 28 per cent in April 1993 - to go ahead.
The phasing out by the government of Urban Programme money (down from Pounds
41.1m in 1992-93 to Pounds 27m in 1993-94 in the region) which funded
projects across the inner cities through the local authorities, is hard on
neighbourhoods which have not been designated for Estate Action, City
Challenge or other area-specific programmes. Urban Programme has funded a
wide variety of economic, social and training projects in the past.
Three housing estates on the outskirts of Birmingham demonstrate the swings
and roundabouts of government funding policy. Nobody denies their need. But
they did not qualify for the old system of funding, which concentrated on
the inner city.
Now one of the estates, the most needy, has attracted Estate Action. But one
of the two adjoining estates, only slightly less deprived, falls outside old
and new funding.
The Castle Vale housing estate in the north east of the city accepted the
government's terms for money to be pumped in via a Housing Action Trust. The
private sector also has a lot of unfit housing; it is more difficult to find
the means to upgrade. Current rates of investment in upgrading or replacing
this stock do not keep pace with the problem.
The quality of life in much of the region's urban areas is poor. East and
west Birmingham health authorities have described their territories as among
the unhealthiest places in the UK. The number of households with at least
one person suffering from long term illness is nearly 50 per cent higher
than in a Warwickshire village. In the Black Country's Sandwell district, a
new worry is the high incidence of diabetes among people with ethnic
minority backgrounds.
The quality of the environment is part of the quality of life. Nobody has
given it a high priority in the predominantly urban West Midlands.
That is just beginning to change. Birmingham has shown that it is possible
to improve the urban environment, at least in the centre of the city.
A new report* prepared by the West Midlands Forum of local authorities calls
on other towns and cities in the region to follow the Birmingham example in
a campaign to make the region more attractive.
This is just one of the recommendations in a report to the European
Commission which aims to convince the West Midlands that its industrial
competence will go unrecognised in the wider world unless it addresses a
number of related environmental and economic issues.

FT  14 JUL 93 / Survey of Birmingham and West Midlands (6): Some worrying
trends - Unemployment statistics analysed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NOBODY is quite sure why there was a fourth successive monthly fall in the
West Midlands unemployment figures in May. In fact - surprisingly, given the
level of business - the employment position looked more cheerful than for
over a year.
More cheerful, that is, because the unemployment position had ceased to
deteriorate. Analysis by the West Midlands Enterprise Board shows that over
the period between November 1992 and May 1993, unemployment across the
region fell by 0.1 per cent.
At the same time there have been some more job opportunities. The rough
measurement of the unemployment to vacancy ratio (reached by dividing the
number of jobless by the number of job centre and careers office vacancies)
fell to 29 in May from 32.7 in April. The national ratios were respectively
21.1 and 23.
The figures are surprising because, as Mr Martin Booth, the WMEB's chief
economist, says: 'One would have expected a stronger output rise before
unemployment declines.' But he also notes that, traditionally, 'the West
Midlands goes deeper into recession than the national economy and, when it
comes out, it comes out faster than the national average.'
The difficulty is that the overall figures contain some damaging trends. Not
least among them is the high proportion of those who have been without jobs
for more than a year and are thus classified as long term unemployed. This
proportion has increased in regional terms to 38.5 per cent of the May 1993
total unemployed from 36 per cent in October 1992. The national average is
35.8 per cent.
Once the long term unemployed percentages are narrowed down, sharp
differences emerge within the region. The area with the highest percentage
is that of the old West Midlands county - the Birmingham-Black Country
conurbation with Solihull and Coventry. Here the proportion is 43.3 per cent
 -compared with 29.8 per cent in Shropshire, lowest in the region.
A second series of damaging statistics comes from the absolute numbers when
they are broken down to ward level.
Total unemployment in the region during May was 282,300; or 11.1 per cent,
against a national average of 10.4 per cent.
But there are 12 wards in the conurbation - five in Birmingham, three in
Wolverhampton, two in Coventry and one each in Sandwell and Walsall - where
male unemployment rates run at more than 35 per cent. The main thing these
wards have in common is that they are inner city areas.
Local authorities worry that there are enlarging communities which are
moving outside the economic cycle: even when the economy recovers, the
unemployment rate in the inner city wards will remain high. It is to these
areas, of course, that development programmes are directed.
But the effect of areas of unemployment and deprivation on the general
business growth of the West Midlands region is not clear; prosperity and
poverty have marched hand in hand in the Midlands since the industrial
revolution. Moreover, there is a danger that deprivation saps confidence and
drives away potential investors whatever the attractions of, say, a city
centre.

FT  14 JUL 93 / Survey of Birmingham and West Midlands (4): Need to train
more precisely on target - A skills problem
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEWART DALBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE West Midlands region is typical of the skills mismatch which bedevils
much of Britain. Even in recession, companies report difficulties in
acquiring the skilled labour they need.
Sandwell demonstrates the problem. In this urban district in the Black
Country, 45 per cent of the workforce is employed in manufacturing. Ethnic
minorities account for 25 per cent of the population.
Mr John Bedingfield, chief executive of the Sandwell Training &amp; Enterprise
Council (TEC), says that companies tell him they need to find skilled labour
 -yet 20,000 people, 17 per cent of the workforce, are without jobs.
Asked how many of these would be unemployable even in a buoyant economic
climate, Mr Bedingfield replies that it is impossible to say. 'I'd like to
think that no-one, or at least very few people are unemployable. But it is
important to establish where education ends and training begins. Some young
people in the area have low education attainments and aspirations. It is a
question of teaching them interview techniques, showing them how to make out
a curriculum vitae, motivating people who have never had jobs. Only then can
you think about specific vocational training.
Sandwell TEC is tackling training through two programmes it inherited from
the government's training agency: the youth training programme, and
employment training for adult long-term unemployed.
Youth training includes a system for the financial support of young people
of 16 and 17 upwards. The programme gives them training over two years,
either through an approved training provider, or (ideally) a job. The hope
is that the trainee will achieve a national vocational qualification.
For adult returners the period of training is usually shorter; up to six
months. There are about 3,000 people on the two schemes.
Over 80 per cent of Sandwell TEC's budget of Pounds 12.5m is allocated to
these two projects. But there are many other schemes - Investors in People,
for example, in which companies make a public commitment to develop their
employees to achieve business objectives, and give counselling in schools.
Mr Bedingfield says: 'More precise targeting is the key to training; we are
in close touch with 70 companies and try to match training to their needs.'
Sandwell is one of 10 TECs in the West Midlands; the biggest is Birmingham
TEC, which has a Pounds 50m budget from the government. The Birmingham TEC,
like the others, was set up (in 1990) to manage and develop the Department
of Employment's training programmes for young people and adults and to
support new and developing businesses. The TEC has refined the youth
training programme into a system of credits. A printed voucher is issued to
a young person, enabling him or her to pay for up to 104 weeks of training.
Vouchers can only be cashed with an employer or training provider approved
by the TEC.
The Employment Training (ET) programme has been renamed Training for Work;
an initiative aimed at the adult long-term unemployed. Those eligible must
be between 18 and 60 and unemployed for 6 months, but the programme also
includes people with disabilities; ex-regular members of the armed forces;
people whose first language is not English; people requiring literacy and
numeracy training; returners to the labour market and victims of large scale
redundancies.
The TEC claims that this broader scheme is better than the old ET because it
stops 'skills leakage' - that is, people who, made redundant, then join the
long term unemployed. It also enables older people, not merely school
leavers, to acquire vocational qualifications. Training for Work provides
intensive vocational training (usually up to 34 weeks) aimed at achieving a
national vocational qualification (NVQ).
Birmingham TEC has 5,600 on its youth credits training scheme and between
8,000 and 9,000 on Training for Work. It claims that both are successful. In
1990-91, 1022 participants achieved an NVQ at level 2. In the following year
the figure had more than doubled: to 2443.
Birmingham TEC believes that it is well on the way to meeting national
education and training targets: 80 per cent of young people to have a NVQ to
level 2 by 1997; 50 per cent of young people to reach NVQ level 3 or
equivalent by 2000. (NVQ level 2 is equivalent to four GCSEs; level 3 to two
A-levels.
The TEC likes to feel it is doing much more than simply continuing the
government's training programmes. Mr Larry Freeman, head of marketing
services, says: 'The government schemes we inherited are aimed at the
unemployed. It is perfectly proper that we should try to reduce unemployment
through training. But I believe we cannot have a real skills revolution in
this country unless we combine these programmes with initiatives for the 80
per cent of the available workforce who are in jobs.'
Mr Freeman feels it is especially important in an area such as the West
Midlands, which depends on advanced manufacturing to do something for those
with jobs. He says: 'There is a need for employees in engineering and
electronics continually to upgrade their skills.'
Accordingly, the Birmingham TEC has introduced a number of programmes for
those in work.
The Weekend College programme is thought to be unique to Birmingham. This
gives vouchers, worth Pounds 60, to adults with no skills or low skills,
enabling them to go to college for a certain number of weekends, to upgrade
their skills or learn new ones.
More significantly, perhaps, Birmingham TEC has launched a Skills Investment
Programme which brings together employers in eight different sectors of
employment. Together with the TEC, employers research a sector's needs.
Initiatives for employees - either on site, or elsewhere - follow.
Mr Freeman says: 'These programmes make a start on what has become known as
'up-skilling.' But what is really needed is a national strategy to meet the
changing needs of industries.'

FT  14 JUL 93 / Survey of Birmingham and West Midlands (5): Take an
international spin - Roads, air services and Birmingham's infrastructure
have improved
</HEADLINE>

BIRMINGHAM promotes itself as a 'truly international city' at the heart of a
economically reviving West Midlands region. What exactly does this mean?
Mr Bob Moore is a former banker who is now the chief executive of Birmingham
2000, a pressure group representing 250 companies in Birmingham. It wants to
develop Birmingham as a business centre on a European and world-wide basis.
Mr Moore says: 'The West Midlands is attempting to revive economically by
attracting new investment in industry. If we are to further this, we have to
make Birmingham a city to which foreign businessmen want to come and work.
We must have the full range of professional services and cultural
attractions, so that potential investors do not feel they have to operate
out of London. That is what we mean by creating an international city.'
The West Midlands has been successful in attracting nearly 900 foreign
companies in the past decade to places such as Telford, Redditch, Coventry
and Birmingham. The attraction has been partly the perception of a skilled
workforce, partly the assistance on offer; but mostly, the good location.
The West Midlands is at the heart of Britain's motorway network. The opening
of the final stretch of the M40 motorway from Oxford to Birmingham in jan
1991 eased the pressure on the M1. The 27-mile northern relief road will be
a privately-run toll road) will provide motorists with an alternative to the
heavily congested Midlands section of the M6, from junction 4 at Coleshill
to junction 11 at Laney Green.
The motorway infrastructure has also meant the development of a
distribution/warehouse nexus in the so-called 'golden triangle' of the M6,
M1 and M42/A42.
From this area, 75 per cent of the UK population can be served within a 4
hour drive time, according to Chesterton. the estate agent. This makes it
ideal as a national distribution centre; the warehouses of Toys R Us, Asda,
Toyota and Jacobs are in the area.
The city of Birmingham has improved its internal infrastructure. Mr Alan
Wenban-Smith, assistant director of planning at the city council, says: 'It
was obvious to us in the 1970s that the city centre was letting us down.'
An inner-ring road had acted as a straitjacket around a tiny city centre.
The city council has managed to bring break open the straitjacket by
lowering the road and building a pedestrian bridge linking the civic centre
of the city with Centenary Square and the International Convention Centre.
Elsewhere, around the inner ring road, pedestrian crossings have slowed the
traffic down.
You can now walk from Centenary square through the civic quarter, past the
library and museum, as far as the newly pedestrian precinct of New Street,
passing a number of bistros and wine bars on the way.
The effect of breaking open the road has created a bigger city centre which
includes the Jewellery quarter, the Gunsmiths' quarter, and the Chinese
quarter and Markets area.
Some of the factories in these areas have been turned into offices for the
hundreds of bank workers, accountants and lawyers who have moved to the city
during the past decade.
But the centrepiece of Birmingham's refurbishment so far has been the
International Convention Centre (ICC) and the related National Indoor Arena
behind it.
The ICC grew out of the National Exhibition Centre (NEC), close to the
airport on the outskirts of Birmingham. The NEC is owned and financed by the
city council. In 1991-92 116 exhibitions were held there, and the NEC Arena
staged over 100 concerts.
The NEC is managed, on behalf of the city council, through an agency
agreement to which the Birmingham Chamber of Commerce is a party. It has
been consistently profitable and in the 1992-93 financial year made a
contribution to Birmingham city council's fund of Pounds 11.64m after all
its operating and financial charges. This profitability enabled the the
management company to raise loans to finance the ICC and the indoor arena.
The ICC cost Pounds 180m to build, with some Pounds 50m coming from the
European Regional Development Fund.
The ICC has held 600 conferences and conventions in its eleven halls since
it opened two years ago. It is the home of a 2,200-seat concert hall, where
the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra gives some 60 concerts a year. It
does not make an operating profit (it lost several million pounds in
1991-92). But it has become the showpiece for the city's cultural and
business life and it has stimulated the building of several first class
hotels, notably the Hyatt. The spend in these hotels was put at Pounds 16m
in 1991-92.
Birmingham still has a bad traffic problem. City planners have decided that
there is not enough road capacity for all the traffic seeking to use it. The
cost of congestion to the West Midlands economy has been put at Pounds 500m
a year.
A metro or tram system is thought to be the solution. Metro Midland Line 1
will run from Birmingham Snow Hill to Wolverhampton. The capital cost will
be Pounds 100m, some of it coming from the government, some from the EC.
Part would come from the private sector.
A second line from the city centre out to the airport is costed at Pounds
250m, and plans for a third line are well advanced.
It was hoped that work could start in 1994, but Birmingham will have to
wait. The starting date is now likely to be 1996.
Birmingham's international airport has not matched Manchester airport's
growth - partly because Birmingham is that much closer to London, but also
because civil aviation policy specified the growth of Manchester as
England's largest airport. But Birmingham airport has expanded rapidly. It
now handles nearly 4m passengers and serves 37 destinations in the UK,
Europe and the US.
Mr Bob Taylor, managing director of Birmingham International Airport says:
'Business travellers found it easy to go the London airports if they wanted
to fly to the US. I feel a landmark was reached in March when BA started its
daily flight from Birmingham to New York.
'We are not trying to keep up with Manchester, but I feel more and more
business people will want to use Birmingham as a starting point.'

FT  14 JUL 93 / Survey of Birmingham and West Midlands (3): Regional effort
works - Business is picking up in the financial sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHORTLY before his departure from the government, Mr Norman Lamont, then the
chancellor of the exchequer, spoke at a banquet to senior West Midlands
executives. The response was publicly polite and privately indifferent. But
when a local speaker mentioned the management buyout of the Leyland Daf van
plant, a wave of enthusiasm and applause swept through the room.
Just as Leyland Daf has seemed a totem of West Midlands industry - its
future a matter of emotional significance - so the way in which the buyout
was arranged has become a rallying point for the financial community. No
London players here, but regional funding regionally organised, denoting an
ability to provide services across the board.
Coopers &amp; Lybrand organised the financial package for the buyout. The
regional office of 3i provided the main tranche of equity capital and the
senior debt came from the Bank of Scotland. The Birmingham office of Arthur
Andersen, the accountancy firm, whose London office had been the Leyland Daf
receivers, claims a role in facilitating the buyout, by creating the
environment in which 3i could invest money.
It shows increasing activity in a sector hit, as manufacturing was hit, by
both recession and technological change. The flow of deals is high and
'activity levels have moved significantly in the last three months,' says Mr
Bob Moore, chief executive of Birmingham City 2000, the financial and
professional lobby group.
'Generally business is picking up,' agrees Mr Roman McAlindon, managing
partner of Arthur Andersen in Birmingham. 'There is a string of
opportunities coming up, with investment into the Midlands from outside, and
management buyouts are beginning to emerge. But there's been a downturn in
formal receivership appointments; there are not as many of them around now,'
he says.
This could mean some revival of employment opportunities, but growth may
remain more constricted than in the 1980s, because of technological changes
(increased office automation through the use of computers and so on) which
are rushing through the financial services sector.
Between 1981 and 1991, according to analysis by Birmingham City Council's
economic development department, 'financial and professional services
expanded employment by more than a third, creating an additional 16,000
opportunities in the city. However, even this rate of job growth was
significantly lower than the more than 50 per cent growth experienced both
regionally and nationally.'
This increase - to 62,650 jobs, 13.5 per cent of jobs in the city - made the
financial and professional sector the single most important source of
private sector jobs in Birmingham - the region's dominant services centre.
Whether the recession has weakened the strength of this centre is not clear.
To be sure, expansion stopped and the number employed declined to 59,800
last year, but the number of lay-offs in the legal profession, for example,
was tiny compared with what has happened in London law firms.
Within the sector there have been changes. Although there is the full range
of clearing banks (together with their subsidiary companies in areas such as
lease finance, acting under separate names), more than 20 overseas banks,
building societies and insurance companies, the specialist activity of
merchant banking has declined.
Although groups independent of the clearing banks, such as Singer &amp;
Friedlander, remain, Kleinwort Benson and Barclays de Zoete Wedd have
withdrawn. This has left gaps in the market which the accountants have been
keen to fill - as in the Leyland Daf management buyout arrangements -
trading on their easy accessibility, extensive networks and, increasingly, a
willingness to negotiate smaller deals.
But if the choice of companies to negotiate deals and offer financial advice
has declined, there is no shortage of institutions willing to advance equity
funding in sums over Pounds 50,000. The regional office of the department of
trade and industry, seeking to compile a register of finance sources, found
more than 40 of them. More generally, it is agreed in the business community
that there is no shortage of money available.
The key question is the conditions under which it will be advanced - given
that the clearing banks have adopted very cautious lending policies. In
present economic circumstances this bears down critically on the smaller
businesses whose lack of physical assets causes the clearing banks to
exercise even greater caution.
As the debate about funding a way out of recession has continued, attention
has increasingly been paid to devising financial mechanisms for aiding small
companies with soft loans; for addressing financial problems where Pounds
5000, not Pounds 50,000, is the difference between survival and expiry. Thus
the Walsall Enterprise Agency, backed by a finance house, is setting up a
loan fund, modelled on the earlier experience of Sandwell, and Birmingham
Settlement, a voluntary group, is planning a community investment bank.
It is difficult, however, to measure the significance of Birmingham as a
financial centre. While the city is the hub of the region, it is not
automatic that businesses in Coventry or Stoke-on-Trent will look to
Birmingham for services - as opposed to, respectively, London or Manchester.
This uncertainty about its own position pushes the Birmingham financial
community, out of self-interest, to support the city council's attempts to
make Birmingham a cultural centre and to make the centre of the city more
welcoming.
There are local claims that Birmingham is the UK's second largest centre for
financial services - a claim that is repeated in half a dozen other cities.
It has its strengths as a regional centre (as Manchester Business School
established in a 1991 study): for example, in corporate stockbroking through
Albert E. Sharp, Smith Keen Cutler and Sharelink, and in the provision of
legal services through partnerships such as Eversheds, Edge &amp; Ellison,
Wragge and Pinsent.
Manchester Business School makes the point that the Big Six accountancy
practices employed more people in Birmingham than in any other regional
centre, but concluded that 'Manchester is the biggest regional centre in
terms of overall employment in banking, finance, insurance, business
services and leasing.'

FT  14 JUL 93 / Survey of Birmingham and West Midlands (2): Quite a lot of
catching up to do - Manufacturing industry beginning to pull out of the
second recession in 10 years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INDUSTRIAL groups in the region mostly show improved profits, as the economy
starts its move out of recession. But the higher level of earnings usually
owes more to the cost savings brought about by retrenchment and higher
productivity than to recovery of demand.
In short, manufacturing in the West Midlands is emerging from its second
bout of severe surgery in 10 years. The recession of the early 1980s set off
a slimming-down process, as companies came to terms with bloated costs and
began to change their market positions. Manufacturing employment continued
to decline even when the national economy was at its strongest during the
second half of the 1980s. The 1990s recession accelerated an already
established trend.
Cambridge Econometrics, consultants, calculated a 19.2 per cent fall in
manufacturing employment in the West Midlands between 1990 and 1993 and
forecast a further decline of 6.2 per cent - 35,000 jobs - between 1993 and
2000.
But such forecasts do not imply any diminution in the importance of
manufacturing to the regional economy. Indeed, technological change and
increased investment, leading to higher output, generally need fewer people
to do the work. In any case, manufacturing still accounts for 33.1 per cent
of regional gross domestic product, against a national average of about 25
per cent; and for 29.1 per cent of total employment.
The accompanying table demonstrates that the West Midlands' traditional role
as the industrial heart of the UK has not been eroded by the economic
difficulties since 1980. According to the Confederation of British Industry,
the most important sectors in terms of output are: electrical engineering,
motor vehicles and mechanical engineering.
But the regional figures disguise the signal importance to particular
localities of particular industries: ceramics to Stoke-on-Trent; crystal to
the Brierly Hill area of the Black Country; electronics - latterly - to
Telford; leather to Walsall.
Notwithstanding such specialised interests, there have been significant
changes in the industrial structure.
'Figures for the last decade show a shift of emphasis away from metal
manufacturing and other metal goods to motor vehicles and mechanical
engineering. Such movement towards higher value-added industries should
provide potential for future growth and prosperity in the region,' says
Albert E. Sharp, stockbrokers.
An example of this was the disappearance of basic steelmaking from the
region on the one hand, and the gathering power of the automotive components
sector on the other.
But the immediate market prospects for realising this potential are not
encouraging. During the 1980s, the large and medium-sized engineering
groups, especially, built up positions in continental European markets to
such a successful extent that they were protected from the first impact of
the domestic recession.
The latest surveys of both the Engineering Employers' Federation West
Midlands, and the regional group of the Chambers of Commerce, showed that
increased demand for manufactured exports, apparent in the first quarter of
the year, had flattened out in the second quarter.
While the devaluation of sterling offered Midlands manufacturers an
immediate competitive stimulus, the effect was limited.
First, the downturn in continental European markets, especially Germany,
reduced demand. Second, European customers generally demanded a share of the
margin gain which the devaluation offered exporters. Third, the combination
of these two factors increased pressure on export prices, rather than
relieved it. Fourth, there is now some evidence that imported material costs
are rising.
All this has meant that the movement towards recovery has been slow, and is
likely to remain dependent - at least for the rest of this year  - on the
Far East and dollar markets and on the domestic market. Both survey and
corporate reports suggest that there has been recovery in both these market
sectors.
Corporate fortunes are unlikely to improve dramatically except when cost
reductions flow through. All the available measurements point to industry
working well beneath capacity. The chambers of commerce report that only 14
per cent of manufacturing companies are working at full capacity - 43 per
cent are under 80 per cent capacity.
Given, too. that the recession has led to reduced investment, there is bound
to be some catching up to do before the full potential of higher
valued-added manufacturing can be realised. The opportunity is available.
The arrival of Honda, Nissan and Toyota has increased UK car-making capacity
and offered new markets to the component makers.
The prosperity of the component companies causes ripples through the
Midlands. But their prosperity will not be easily gained. The motor
manufacturers have been seeking both to reduce the number of their suppliers
and to change their relationship with them, thrusting out research and
development. So the component makers are in some turmoil, even as their
markets appear to widen. Not only that. With the downturn in continental
European car markets, and the truck market in the doldrums, domestic motor
manufacturers - Ford, Rover, Vauxhall - have been bearing down on suppliers,
demanding price cuts.
However, the pressure to manufacture at low prices has drawn the German
motor manufacturers such as Mercedes-Benz, Volkswagen and BMW to start
buying more of their components in the UK, again widening the potential
market for Midlands manufacturers.
Against the offsetting factors, confidence in the manufacturing sector has
risen. More companies are confident about future trends of turnover and
profitability than for the last three years. But the striking point about
recent business surveys is that confidence is related to future rather than
actual performance.
Once recovery takes hold, manufacturers will have to contend with skill
shortages. Price Waterhouse, in association with the Warwick and
Wolverhampton Business Schools, has already detected the first signs,
warning that 'a real skills shortfall could be in prospect when the
recession ends finally, and it could have a serious impact on our
competitiveness. Lack of fundamental reskilling policy during the recession
will be to blame.'

FT  14 JUL 93 / Survey of Birmingham and West Midlands (1): Step by cautious
step to recovery - The region is reviving, with its industrial
competitiveness enhanced by devaluation. The services sector has suffered a
shake-out, but growth is expected to resume
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THE fundamental question about the West Midlands is not whether the regional
economy will revive after recession. That revival, in erratic fashion, has
started. Rather the question is whether the second recession in 15 years has
pushed the economy towards atrophy.
The difficulties of recent years, coincident with changes in government
policy, the closer integration of the European Community economies and
growing social pressures, especially in the urban areas, accentuate
undercurrents of concern about the longer term future.
The immediate prospects are for modest growth. In broad terms, the flow of
orders began to revive in the early months of the year; business confidence
has risen to the highest levels for three years in expectation that the
pressures on profitability will be relieved.
But at the same time, the downturn in the European economies has blunted the
thrust of recovery which, in any case, was off a low base. Three quarters of
companies are working under full capacity, according to the latest
calculations of forecasters at the Confederation of British Industry and
Business Strategies.
Economists, then, are cautious about regional growth. 'At the start of the
year I forecast 1.5 per cent for 1993,' says Mr Martin Booth, chief
economist at the West Midlands Enterprise Board. 'I think I want to tone
that down slightly now, but I can see stronger growth next year unless the
recovery is choked off.' By stronger growth, he means more than 2.0 per
cent.
Mr David Kern, the chief economist at National Westminster Bank, predicts in
his mid-1993 forecast a 1.5 per cent growth for this year and 2.3 per cent
for 1994. So he is slightly more optimistic than Mr Booth.
Any sustained national rise in consumer and investment spending would
translate fairly quickly into a flow of orders for the engineering industry
of the region and hence into the wider economy. Manufacturing remains the
economic staple.
This is both a strength and a weakness. Although the West Midlands is
traditionally the manufacturing heart of the UK, manufacturing as a source
of employment has declined, is declining and is likely to continue to
decline. The growth of employment in the services sector, until checked by
the latest recession, was slower in the West Midlands than elsewhere in the
UK.
Considering the region as a source of wealth, however, the future may be
brighter than the employment prospects suggest.
The UK government has recently switched its rhetoric to stress the
importance of manufacturing - after a decade of verbal indifference.
Government tax policy has latterly followed lines approved by, for example,
the regional Engineering Employers Federation.
Whether there exists the ability to take advantage of this new place in the
political and economic sun is the wider question.
It bears on the suggestion of economic atrophy. Geographically the region
has no particular advantage: it may be at the centre of the UK, but it is on
the periphery of that arc of European vigour stretching from northern Italy,
through Germany and France, to London.
Yet the pattern of the region's overseas trade is now firmly cast towards
continental Europe. It is in the European arena, the more closely integrated
EC market, that its competitive future will evolve. This is what worries the
West Midlands Regional Forum of Local Authorities (whose collective voice is
more sober than the 'boosterism' of its individual members).
Noting that, as a traditional industrial region, the West Midlands is
expected 'to have above average vulnerability' to competition from within
the EC, while remaining highly dependent on exports to other members of the
EC, the Forum is anxious about the ability to compete. 'By the year 2000, it
has been estimated that 70 per cent of all European jobs will require brain
rather than manual skills, yet levels of academic and skill attainment are
relatively low in the West Midlands. Of particular concern is that several
of the older manufacturing areas appear to lack access to the higher level
skills required for the modernisation of the region's industries,' the Forum
says.
In fact, skills shortages never wholly disappeared - even during the
recession - and there have been indications in recent surveys that skills
shortages have begun to return as the economy revives. Corporate training
budgets were frequently pruned during the recession. The training and
enterprise councils which now stimulate and oversee much of the industrial
training are too recent to have made a lasting impact.
There is also a social element to the question. In general, the areas which
need the jobs most, because of their high unemployment, are the areas where
employment opportunities have diminished.
The wards with highest unemployment are those of the inner cities. But the
Birmingham City Council economic development department has drawn attention
to the way in which job opportunities declined in the inner city, while
increasing in the outer.
Between 1984 and 1991 total employment in the Birmingham outer city grew 4.2
per cent, but declined in the inner city by 7.4 per cent, largely because of
the scale of change in the motor vehicle industry.
Planning policy and official funding is directed towards redressing that
balance throughout the Birmingham-Black Country conurbation. The effort is
to renew tired and derelict inner city areas so that more employment
opportunities will emerge and more people will be trained to take advantage
of them.
Hence the existence of two urban development corporations, in the Black
Country and east Birmingham, and four City Challenge areas in Birmingham,
Sandwell, Walsall and Wolverhampton.
Hence the appeals to government to retain assisted area status, able to
receive regional and industrial development subsidies. Hence, by contrast,
the fevered publicity, asserting how marvellous is the region and the cities
in it.
Yet the pressures for development on the green belt, the steady flow of
tenants into business parks on the edge of the conurbation and the movement
of companies to greenfield sites, in areas such as Telford, testify to a
drift of corporate activity away from the inner city areas of the region,
rather than towards it.
Working through this mix of overlapping problems - inherent skills shortages
and a lack of jobs where jobs are needed most - will be of the first
importance to the development of the region into the next century.
But if their solution is at least partially dependent on the level of
economic activity, there are encouraging factors.
The competitive position of industry changed between the recessions of the
1980s and the 1990s. Generally it is now more productive, more
export-oriented - at least among the large and medium-sized groups.
There has been a widening of the economic base in two senses: an influx of
overseas investment has stimulated the regional economy, not only through
its demands for local goods and services, but also through its spread of
diverse management techniques; and at the same time there has been growth in
the services sector.
This throws up two caveats: if overseas industry has been attracted mostly
because of low domestic costs, then it can disappear as quickly as it came,
while the expansion of the services sector is largely an expansion of the
low wage economy.
The third encouraging factor is the developing links between the
universities - Aston, Birmingham, Coventry, Warwick, Wolverhampton and the
rest - and industrial groups. Co-operation of this kind will stimulate the
movement of companies towards higher technology and new products, bringing
into play different disciplines and harnessing wider ranges of skills. Here
the future of the region rests.

FT  14 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Jordan cultivates phosphates
exports - The industry's moves into wider markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES WHITTINGTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DESPITE a depression in the world market for phosphates and potash, Jordan
is proving to be a remarkably resilient exporter.
Jordan Phosphate Mines Company, which is majority-owned by the state, last
year captured 15.3 per cent of world phosphate exports, making it the number
two exporter of phosphate rock, behind Morocco and overtaking the US. Potash
sales in 1992 were up to 3.24 per cent of total world exports. Furthermore,
Jordan's mining sector is rapidly changing to meet the demands of the market
and it seems set to become a big producer of complex fertilisers and
chemicals by the end of the century.
JPMC's phosphate exports fell from 6.4m tonnes in 1989 to 4.2m tonnes in
1991 - in line with a 37.7 per cent drop in world exports of phosphate rock
in 1989-92 and the collapse of the company's traditional eastern European
markets. The company's exports picked up slightly to 4.3m tonnes last year,
and results from the first half of this year suggest that a similar figure
is likely for 1993.
The lower exports - in addition to falling international prices and severe
government taxes recently implemented under Jordan's economic restructuring
programme - have slashed the JPMC's net profits almost seven-fold over the
past four years. Last year the company registered a net profit of only 16.1m
Jordanian dinars (Dollars 22.8m) compared with JD33.1m in 1991 and JD109m in
1989.
However, JPMC's general manager, Mr Thabet Taher, brushes aside any talk of
doom and gloom. With a gradual shift of trade towards the rapidly expanding
Asian markets, and two major joint ventures for the production of
phosphate-based fertilisers and phosphoric acid already signed with Indian
and Japanese companies, he is optimistic about the future.
Contracts with India have partly replaced the loss of eastern European
markets. Despite distortions in India's demand for fertiliser, caused by the
government's recent abolition of price controls, Jordan shipped 1.3m tonnes
of phosphate to India last year - making it JPMC's biggest client. In 1991,
a Dollars 150m joint venture was signed with India's Southern Petrochemicals
Corporation to produce an annual 200,000 tonnes of phosphoric acid for the
Indian market. A new processing plant with 60 per cent Indian and 40 per
cent Jordanian equity is due to begin operations in 1995 and, according to
Mr Taher, Indian demand may be increased to 400,000 tonnes.
A similar deal was signed last year with a Mitsubishi-led consortium of four
Japanese companies that will take a 60 per cent share in a Dollars 360m
compound fertiliser plant. JPMC and Arab Potash Company (APC), Jordan's
other main exporter, will each have a 20 per cent holding. Under the
agreement, a new plant, due to open in 1995, will produce 300,000 tonnes of
compound fertiliser for Japan, which is about 10 per cent of the country's
entire consumption.
JPMC is negotiating with trading partners in Pakistan to establish another
joint venture that will produce material for the Pakistani market.
Meanwhile, APC is also following strategies of product diversification and
expansion as a means of securing its future. The company, which has a
phosphate plant on the Dead Sea, is 58 per cent owned by the Jordan
government and 42 per cent by foreign Arab investors. It has maintained
annual exports of potash of between 1.3 and 1.4m tonnes over the past five
years.
Unlike JPMC, APC exports have been relatively unaffected by the political
upheavals of eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union as most of its trade
is with Asian countries. Last year it exported a total of 1.35m tonnes of
phosphate, 87 per cent of which went to Asian markets.
But APC has seen its profits fall. Despite a 12 per cent drop in exports
between 1991 and 1992, net profits fell from JD38m to JD28m, mainly because
of an increase in government levies.
APC's plans include a two-phase expansion programme, already under way at
its Dead Sea site, which will increase potash production capacity to 1.8m
tonnes by 1994 and 2.2m tonnes by the year 2000. George Wimpey International
is the contractor. In addition, a Dollars 600m Dead Sea chemicals complex is
due to begin operations in 1995. It will produce bromine derivatives,
magnesium oxide and potassium-based fertilisers.
APC's managing director, Mr Ali Yousef Ensour, explains that loans of
Dollars 31m from the World Bank and the Jeddah-based Islamic Bank for
Development have so far been agreed upon. Additional funding is expected to
be raised by APC and foreign investors. Two US companies, Ethyl Corporation
and Great Lakes Chemicals, are assisting with the technical side of the
plans.
With the abundance of raw materials and the unique saline composition of the
Dead Sea, Mr Ensour says he is confident the complex will put Jordan on the
map as a highly competitive chemical producer in addition to its phosphate
and potash exports.

FT  14 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Speculators spark Dollars 77
fall in copper price
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COPPER'S PRICE collapsed yesterday as commodity funds pulled out of the
market and speculative selling sent the metal down to Dollars 1,861 a tonne
in after-hours dealing.
Since early May copper has gained about Dollars 300 a tonne and touched
Dollars 2,020, a three-month peak, on Friday. Then in the first two trading
days this week it lost half about half those gains, dropping by Dollars 46 a
tonne on Monday and another Dollars 77 yesterday.
The collapse, like the rise, was caused by technical factors but it was so
spectacular that it undermined sentiment in other metals markets. Aluminium
and nickel prices were particularly badly affected.
Mr Wiktor Bielski, analyst at Bain &amp; Company, part of the Deutsche Bank
group, pointed out that copper's collapse originated late on Friday on the
New York Commodity Exchange when there was a huge volume of selling.
The market was surprised by a rise in the London Metal Exchange's copper
stocks on Friday, when a reduction was expected. There was another rise
reported yesterday, taking the total up by 11,000 tonnes to a fresh 15-year
peak of 458,000 tonnes.
Nevertheless, Mr Bielski argued that, while copper's prospects were poor for
the next few months and the price might fall back below 80 cents a pound
(Dollars 1763 a tonne), present bearish sentiment was probably overdone. For
example, total copper stocks represented only 6 1/2 -7 weeks' consumption
whereas in the previous recession they reached the 14-weeks level.
Other analysts have been revising copper price forecasts they made in
January and now predict much lower levels. Smith New Court, which predicted
then that copper would average 110 cents a pound in 1993, now suggests 90
cents is more likely. Warburg is also predicting a 90-cents average, down
from a January forecast of 105 cents, and Ord Minnett has reduced its
forecast from 102 cents to 90 cents. Billiton-Enthoven Metals predicts a
90-cents average for 1993 but that was its January forecast.

FT  14 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Bangladesh jute estimate cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   CALCUTTA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BANGLADESH'S 1993-94 jute crop is expected to fall short of an earlier
estimate of 4.5m bales (180kg each), which was itself 500,000 bales below
1992-93 output.
The smaller crop is mainly the result of the diversion of land from jute to
rice, which gives a better return to the farmers. According to Bangladesh
trade officials, more than 10 per cent of the 525,000 hectares under jute
last year has been diverted to rice.
However, the use of certified Indian seeds on a large scale and adequate
retting (softening) facilities will ensure that a high percentage of quality
fibre is produced.
At least 75 per cent of the crop will be tossa jute, a variety that is
increasingly favoured by jute mills both inside and outside the country. The
balance will be white jute.
The average annual requirement of raw jute in Bangladesh is 4.8m bales,
including 2.9m bales for consumption by mills, 1.5m bales for export and
400,000 bales for village use. The shortfall will be taken care of by this
season's comfortable opening stocks at the start of this month of more than
1m bales.
The 1994-95 jute season will, however, open with low stocks. Trade officials
think a fairly large volume of jute from Bangladesh will find its way into
India through unauthorised channels because prices of the commodity are
25-40 per cent higher in India, depending on grade.
As in the past, the export-orientated jute mills in India will import some
high quality raw jute from Bangladesh, and India is expected to harvest a
lower crop of 6.5m bales in the current season.
The low prices of jute in Bangladesh have been attributed to the
government's decision to end price support. The new season crop has only
just started coming on to the market in small lots but prices are already
depressed.
The principal importers of jute from Bangladesh are Pakistan, Russia and
some European and African countries. Thailand, itself a producer of the
fibre, also buys from Bangladesh. Jute and jute goods are Bangladesh's main
foreign exchange earners.

FT  14 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Fears of frost in Brazil push
coffee up to Dollars 1,000
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   YAOUNDE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
COFFEE PRICES surged ahead in London yesterday as buyers rushed to the
market in fear that Brazil's crop would be affected by frosts this week.
London's September futures contract rose by Dollars 48 to touch a peak of
Dollars 1,016 a tonne. But it later dropped to close at Dollars 1,000 as the
New York market became very volatile.
One private weather forecaster has estimated that there is a 50 per cent
chance of frost in Brazil's Parana coffee-growing areas late today or early
tommorrow. Other forecasters are more sceptical and put the chances of frost
at 20 per cent or 30 per cent.
Nevertheless, coffee traders remember the devastating frosts of 1975 that
almost wiped out the Brazilian coffee crop and led to a boom in prices. For
that reason any hint of frost is enough to push prices higher.
Since 1975 Brazil has concentrated its plantings further north in regions
less susceptible to frost. In the south, Parana now accounts for only 10 per
cent of the country's crop; it was once the main coffee-growing state.
Brazil's share of the world coffee crop has also declined so the impact of a
frost on world prices could be less dramatic than in the past.
Coffee prices have been depressed by high stocks in consuming countries such
as the US and Europe. Last week the price was boosted by meetings between
producers over a retention scheme and the threat of a frost in Brazil last
weekend.
If the frosts fail to materialise, prices could drop swiftly, one analyst
suggested.
Exporters in Cameroon estimate that the country's 1992-93 robusta coffee
production will be just over half last season's level at about 45,000
tonnes, Reuter reports from Yaounde.
The Douala-based Conseil Interprofessionel du Cafe et du Cacao said 1991-92
production was 85,409 tonnes. That figure was less than the ministry of
industry and commerce's estimate of 97,835 tonnes, but local industry
officials said the ministry figure was subject to manipulation by exporters.
The CICC's executive secretary, Enouga Ntsimi, said all the 1991-92 crop had
now been sold and forecast 1993-94 output at about 70,000 tonnes.
Cameroon cut the producer price for robusta coffee by a third at the start
of this season after the government had to subsidise 1991-92 production with
8.2bn CFA francs (Pounds 19m) in payments.
Mr Ntsimi said most of the fall was normal, reflecting cyclical variation of
yields from the coffee trees. But he estimated that 20 per cent was a result
of farmers cutting down their trees.

The collapse in the copper market (see story above) undermined sentiment in
the other London Metal Exchange contracts to varying degrees. The next
biggest loser was ALUMINIUM, which added Dollars 31.25 to Monday's Dollars
27 fall to close at Dollars 1,186.25 a tonne in the three months position.
Traders attributed the fall to nervous liquidation, which gained momentum
after support at Dollars 1,200 was broken. ZINC reversed the recent uptrend
with three months metal closing Dollars 9.75 down at Dollars 965.50 a tonne
and NICKEL's continuing decline was exacerbated by news of a fresh increase
in LME warehouse stocks. The GOLD market began with a test of support at
Dollars 390 a troy ounce following an overnight wave of selling by Japanese
trade houses. But the subsequent recovery to Dollars 393.75 an ounce, down
30 cents on the day, at the London bullion market close showed that there
was 'good physical demand on the dips', said one dealer. 'Investors are
happy to take profits at about three to four dollars above the market, while
shorts are covering at around Dollars 390 and there are plenty of stops
(stop-loss orders) just below that,' he added.

break seed limit

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRENCH FARMERS are likely to have exceeded their grain, oilseed and
proteinseed area limit and be forced to set aside an even larger portion of
their land next season, Reuter reports from Paris.
'We're probably heading towards an excess, although it's difficult to know
for sure,' an agriculture ministry official said.
Definitive figures are expected in early August when farmers' applications
for European Community direct aid payments are registered. According to
ministry projections, France is likely to have exceeded by 322,000-483,000
hectares its 1989-91 reference area of 13.522m hectares, which was set as a
limit under the EC's new farm system.
EC members decided last May to shift the focus of their Common Agricultural
Policy from price support to direct aid to farmers in an effort to cut their
huge surpluses of food.
The grain, oilseed and protein-seed excess is likely to be made even worse
next season as more farmers choose to join the scheme.
Only 539,000 farmers sent their applications for direct aid instead of the
745,000 expected, an official said.

FT  14 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Indices offer confusing
inflation clues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOND TRADERS who use commodity prices to predict inflation-rate changes have
had to pick their indicators carefully this year. Industrial commodity
prices have for the most part fallen, while futures prices for consumer
goods such as cereals, gold and softs have tended to rise.
At the same time, US government indices that measure price movements have
exhibited a curious tendency to follow seasonal variations - a trend belies
the Bureau of Labour Statistics' practice of adjusting prices for seasonal
factors.
If, as forecast, the BLS reports today that consumer prices were flat in
June, it will bring the consumer price index (CPI) back to a year-over-year
rate close to 3 per cent - little changed from last year.
That is good news for businesses and the US Federal Reserve Board, which aim
for price stability. However, it is a puzzle to fixed-income traders who
shorted bonds when inflation took an alarming swing upwards in the first
quarter.
Mr John Lipsky, chief economist for Salomon Brothers, says CPI data have
risen in the first four months of every year since 1989, without
consistently following through for the rest of the year.
The June CPI, if it comes in on forecast, will smooth the first quarter's
seasonal changes. 'For now, outlook for energy prices is good, demand is not
too strong, and the dollar is helpings us out overseas. That gives a pretty
steady outlook for inflation,' Mr Lipsky said.
The calm inflation forecast seems to be borne out by commodity prices. While
the Commodity Research Bureau's closely watched index of futures prices
reached 20-month highs last week, it did so on the strength of soyabean and
precious metals prices.
Those commodities carry very little weight in either the CPI or the producer
price index. A better indicator of price inflation is the CRB's index of
spot industrial commodities, heavily weighted towards scrap metals and
materials like rubber and tin.
That index, in contrast to the futures index, is near its lowest levels of
the year. A third, the Goldman Sachs commodity index, is in a similar
position.
The two indices are moving in parallel because industrial metals and energy
prices have been locked together this year. Economists say it will take an
upward turn in the broader indexes to predict a shift in inflation
expectations.

FT  14 JUL 93 / Jobs: Mythical mice . . . and middle managers - Ambitious
move to lay down national standards for a type of activity that may not
exist
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL DIXON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
READERS who are middle managers, and the rest of us on their behalf, should
perhaps be grateful. For during this past half decade much analytic
brainpower has been exerted on a question which, having an awful lot of work
on their hands, they themselves are mostly too busy to think about.
The question is what precisely is it that middle managers do for their pay?
And the brainpower has been brought to bear by a body named the Management
Charter Initiative which has the backing of 1,614 employing outfits, and the
blessing of - albeit no longer automatic funding from - the British
government. The employers, mostly large, consist of 850 businesses, 293
public-sector organisations and 471 others such as the Royal National
Institute for the Blind.
It would be wrong, of course, to suppose that the MCI body is the only one
which has lately been pondering the aforesaid question. Many others have
done likewise since the recession began, especially in the business sector.
Alas their thinking has less often resulted in a definition of what middle
managers do than in a decision that, whatever it may be, a lot of it is
unnecessary. Hence wholesale firings trendily euphemised as 'de-layering'.
The charter body, however, has remained above such logic-chopping. Not only
has it pursued its inquiries into the various activities and other elements
making up middle-management work, but it has published its conclusions in a
tastefully designed and systematically organised book* of 134 pages.
Given the wealth of research showing that reading is not something managers
do unless obliged to, even the book's modest length seems unlikely to make
it a best seller among people doing the work the authors analyse. So it's
probably as well that, to judge by the tenor of the book, it is mainly
intended not so much for middle managers as for their 'assessors', who are
not necessarily the same kind of animal.
For one thing, whereas mid-rank executives are bidding fair to become an
endangered species, assessment is a growth industry. Indeed the MCI itself
is allied to Britain's National Vocational Qualifications scheme set up to
award certificates to people deemed to merit same, in parallel to the
certificates awarded by the academic educational network.
For another thing, although the job of assessors is to judge suitability for
work in middle management, they apparently do not need to have worked as
middle managers themselves. Hence their judgment can be entirely
uncontaminated by narrow experience of what they are judging. Moreover,
thanks to the charter body, they no longer have to rely on rules of thumb
such as whether the person under assessment is related to the company
chairman. They can be guided by the book's analysis.
The idea underpinning it was evidently originated by American psychologist
David McClelland in the 1970s. Its nub is that although any given job may be
done in different ways by different people, those who are good at it display
certain patterns of skilled behaviour that are essentially the same in all
cases. Such patterns are known as 'competences'.
They are exemplified by the three which Professor McClelland identified in a
searching study of how successful diplomats in United States embassies
overseas differed from people doing the same job badly.
One thing the successful had in greater degree was political nous: 'the
ability to figure out quickly who influences whom and what each person's
political intrests are. Another was 'the ability to hear what people from a
foreign culture are really meaning, and to predict how they will react.' The
third he picked out was 'a strong belief in the underlying dignity and worth
of others different from oneself, and the ability to maintain this positive
outlook under stress.'
As a measure of ability to do the diplomatic job well, tests of those three
competences proved better than either standard aptitude and intelligence
tests or paper qualifications. Even so, the tests were by no means a perfect
measure. The professor made no pretence that just looking at the competences
was sufficient to judge people's overall suitability for the work. That
necessitated considering their performance in the job as a whole.
The British charter body professes to agree. The evidence used in
assessment, the book declares, must '. . . describe the activities required
by the occupational role as a whole rather than a fragmented and
over-detailed list of tasks.'
It then serenely proceeds to list 36 'elements of competence', 258
'performance criteria', and 351 'range indicators' - some of which
admittedly overlap from element to element - together with what the MCI
evidently regards as a less than complete inventory of 439 sorts of evidence
to be evaluated.
While that tally might seem fulsome compared with David McClelland's three
competences, there's a point to be remembered. He focused on a specific type
of job done in a specific setting. The MCI is spreading its web across
middle management in general, regardless of economic sector let alone kind
of organisation.
Whether such a universal activity really exists, however, is another
question. True, a well defined entity called 'middle' management can be
found on notional organisation charts: it's the chunk of the pyramid just
below 'senior' management. But does any such entity exist in the actual
workplace as distinct from purely on paper?
While the MCI evidently thinks so, numerous authorities on management would
disagree. One who'd be apt to do so, for example, is Harvard Business
School's Professor John Kotter. A second is Bath University's Professor of
Management Iain Mangham, who waxes eloquent on the daftness of the myth that
the abilities of real-life managers are somehow assembled from a kit of
standard competences, as one might construct Mickey Mouses out of Lego
blocks.
Besides, the charter body's performance criteria are not entirely
self-consistent. Take for example those on leading meetings. One is that the
people invited to attend should be 'appropriate to the context and the
purpose of the meeting' Another - to which the assessor is presumably
required to give equal weight - is that 'unhelpful arguments and
digressions' should be effectively discouraged.
Since people who indulge in such digressions can hardly be appropriate to
the meeting, surely any leader needing to take the discouraging action must
be marked down for having invited them in the first place. On the other
hand, if they aren't invited, the leader must lose the ordained mark for
deterring digressions because none will arise.
Such details aside, however, the MCI is certainly right in claiming that it
has taken a positive step towards establishing standards of management work.
The only trouble is that even positive steps can be dangerous when taken on
shaky ground.
So before proceeding any farther in its grand bureaucratic endeavour, the
charter body should perhaps remember James Thurber's maxim: 'One can just as
well fall flat on one's face as lean over too far backwards.'

FT  14 JUL 93 / Government Bonds: Gilts shrug off 1.8% rise in manufacturing
output
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN and PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE LATEST batch of UK economic data may have suggested that a recovery was
in full swing but the gilt market failed to react accordingly, and was only
slightly lower on the day.
Ultra long-dated gilt yields were at their lowest for more than 20 years
when trading began yesterday morning.
News that manufacturing output had risen by 1.8 per cent in May against
market expectations of only 0.3 per cent should have provided a perfect
opportunity to take profits. That argument could have been strengthened by
the weakness of government bond markets in mainland Europe.
There was a knee-jerk reaction and September gilt futures tumbled  5/8 to
108 after the data was released.
However, the Central Statistics Office said the data had been distorted by
the late May bank holiday. This dampened the enthusiasm and gilt prices rose
again.
Although the futures contract closed at 107 29/32 , most dealers said the
slide was testing buying interest and reflecting the weakness in Europe
rather than a fundamental shift in economic opinion.
Gilts has been rising steadily since May and the lack of volatility has
meant buyers have found few opportunities to get into the market. Therefore,
there was still strong demand. Mr Andy Tweed, gilts specialist with BZW,
said: 'Each time the market came back we saw buyers.'
Mr Ian Shepherdson, UK economist with Midland Global Markets, said: 'The
market had been expecting a moderate increase in output and it got a
staggering increase. The trend is undeniably upwards but the market does not
believe the underlying trend to be as strong as these figures suggest.'
The price of 15-year gilts eased only  1/32 to 109 3/8 and dealers said
there was switching into index-linked gilts, which have been left behind.
GERMAN government bonds slipped, although the markets were looking for a cut
of around 5 basis points in the repo today
Bund futures for September fell 0.22 to 96.08 on low volume as recent heavy
foreign buying faded away.
Economists are hanging fire over a reduction in the key floor rates at the
Bundesbank council meeting tomorrow until they see what happens at the repo.
Some argue that if the funds injected at the repo top DM72bn and the cut is
more than five basis points that would be a clear signal for a cut in
lending rates on July 29 and possibly as soon as tomorrow CONTINUING
pressure on the French franc failed to check the French bond market which
tested a new high before ending the day around 0.20 up on the previous close
at 119.92.
Mr Kit Juckes, economist with SG Warburg Securities, said: 'If there is a
problem in France it's a currency problem and not a bond problem. Real
yields are very high, a protracted rise in interest rates is not on the
cards and the Balladur auction has shown that there is an excess of spare
savings.'
JAPANESE government bonds held on to their gains in London as investors
bought on renewed hopes of a rate cut.
Dealers said that there had been investment buying during Tokyo trading by
domestic life insurance firms and pension funds, taking the yield on the JGB
No 145 from 4.28 per cent to 4.26 per cent.
AMONG the high yielders, Spanish bonds were barely moved after the Bank of
Spain left key money rates unchanged and June CPI figures came in as
expected.
Italian government bonds were firmer ahead of the Bundesbank repo today with
BTP September futures rising by 27 basis points to 104.41.
US TREASURY prices were mixed across the board in the wake of June inflation
numbers that were in line with, but no better than, expectations.
In late trading the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  3/32 at 106
19/32 , yielding 6.611 per cent. At the short end, the two-year note was
slightly weaker, down  3/32 at 100 3/16 , to yield 4.007 per cent.
The keenly-awaited June producer prices report confirmed that inflation does
not pose a threat to fixed-income markets. The Labor Department announced
that its producer prices index fell 0.3 per cent in June, and its core
measure of prices - excluding the volatile food and energy components -
declined 0.1 per cent.
The data were consistent with Wall Street forecasts, although some analysts
had hoped for a bigger decline in core producer prices. This accounted for
the early selling, said dealers. While prices at the short end remained
lower, the long end staged a modest rally in the wake of declining
commodities and gold prices.
Ultimately, however, the good inflation news was already priced into bonds,
so there was no need for investors to rush into Treasuries. It was not long
before attention turned to the next set of data, today's release of the June
consumer prices index, which analysts expect to mimic the performance of the
PPI.
Technical problems with the information service meant that closing benchmark
government bond prices were unreliable yesterday. Consequently the table has
not been published

FT  14 JUL 93 / International Capital Markets: Japanese bonds stay cool
ahead of election

<TEXT>
As the countdown to Sunday's landmark election gets under way, the Japanese
bond market is looking remarkably sanguine, with long-term yields in the
lower half of this year's trading range.
Last minute campaigning might be all about political reform, with most of
the new reformist groups pledging themselves to programmes for economic
recovery, but bond market participants have mostly focused on recent
economic data.
The data have pointed unequivocally to a delayed recovery, and bond yields
have fallen steadily on renewed hopes of a cut in the official discount rate
by the Bank of Japan.
The yield on the No 145 benchmark 10-year bond yesterday closed at 4.255 per
cent, down from a May peak closer to 4.8 per cent.
Industrial production for May fell by 2.4 per cent compared with April.
Meanwhile, the growth of housing starts decelerated to 0.3 per cent
year-on-year, after averaging 5.5 per cent in the first quarter of this
year.
May's total employment fell by 0.2 per cent from the previous month, while
consumer demand also slumped, with growth of chain store sales falling by
2.5 per cent year-on-year.
Many private economists have revised their economic growth forecasts
downward for the fiscal year. This has led to buying of long-term bonds.
Institutional investors, which have been buyers of short-term bonds due to
forecasts of a near-term economic recovery, are now investing in the No 145
bond.
If - as widely predicted - the ruling Liberal Democratic Party does not
regain its majority in Sunday's general election, a coalition government
would result. The core party in any coalition would be likely to be
conservative.
However, whatever the combination, an immediate stimulus for Japan's economy
through public spending looks unlikely.
Mr Marshall Gittler, bond market analyst at Merrill Lynch, reckons that a
coalition government would take its time in dealing with the sluggish
economy.
He predicts that the Bank of Japan will be forced to cut interest rates,
pushing down the yield on the No 145 benchmark to 4 per cent during the
third quarter.
However, politicians in the new structure may try to arouse popular support
through income tax cuts.
Ms Tomoko Fujii, an economist at Salomon Brothers, says such fiscal favours
will create higher fiscal deficits. Together with refinancing by
corporations of equity-linked bonds issued in the 1980s, this could put
pressure on bond yields in the medium term, she says.
Ms Fujii expects the BoJ to remain reluctant to cut rates due to fears of
reflation. This will make it difficult for the long bond yield to fall below
4.2 per cent, she says. In the long run, however, the impact of any
political shake-up could be positive for the bond market.
Electoral reform will correct the over-representation in the rural areas,
shifting more power to the urban electorate. This could liberalise areas
such as agriculture and distribution, leading to lower inflation.

FT  14 JUL 93 / International Bonds: Dutch bank launches tightly priced
Eurosterling deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BORROWERS tapped the international bond market using a wide assortment of
currencies and structures - including straight bonds, floating rate notes
and equity-linked issues - yesterday.
In the Eurosterling sector Bank Nederlandse Gemeenten, the Dutch bank which
funds local authorities, launched a Pounds 200m, 10-year bond which some
banks criticised for being too aggressively priced, especially since the
borrower does not have an official credit rating.
BNG's bonds were priced to yield 20 basis points over the gilt, giving a
yield of 7.83 per cent. Some dealers said the yield pick-up was too small to
appeal to UK investors.
However, Paribas Capital Markets, the bookrunner for the deal, argued that
BNG was regarded as 'in line with triple-A borrowers,' given that it was
owned 50 per cent by the state and 50 per cent by the municipalities.
The deal was swapped into guilders, allowing the borrower to achieve its
funding target of 25 - 30 basis points over the yield on the 10-year Dutch
state loan - or around 6.75 per cent.
Paribas Capital Markets said demand came mainly from international investors
who saw little downside risk with the currency and who like the yield
pick-up over the core European government bonds.
Elsewhere, the Republic of Austria launched a Dollars 350m, four-year
floating-rate note, with a coupon of three-month Libor capped at 6.25 per
cent.
CSFB, the lead manager, said the deal attracted interest from money market
funds, which liked the higher, up-front coupon. 'A lot of people think we
are in a low interest rate environment and that if rates rise, they won't be
going up that much,' said an official.
One rival house criticised the deal, saying that it was rare to see such a
low cap. Some of the much older issues (with a similar maturity date)
trading in the market have caps of as much as 12 per cent.
Bayerische Vereinsbank, one of Germany's two large Bavaria-based banks,
yesterday launched a collared floating rate note in the Canadian dollar
sector of the international bond market.
The CDollars 150m, 10-year deal has a coupon set at the rate on three-month
bankers acceptances less 30 basis points, with a floor of 6.25 per cent and
a maximum of 10 per cent. Three-month bankers acceptances are currently
about 4 3/8 per cent. Kidder Peabody International, the lead manager,
reported strong retail investor interest.
In the equity-linked sector, Morgan Stanley brought a L565bn convertible
bond issue for Softe, a financial subsidiary of Stet, the Italian public
sector telecommunications group.
The bonds can be exchanged for shares in Sip, the main telephone utility
(Stet is the holding company for Sip).

BANCO Nacional de Mexico, (Banamex), Mexico's largest bank, is poised to
offer 1bn pesos (Dollars 320m) of medium-term notes in the international
capital markets. It will be the first peso-denominated Euronote offering by
a Mexican company since Mexico's return to international debt markets in
1989.
Banamex's existing peso debt is rated A grade by Standard &amp; Poor's. The
issue will enable Banamex to fund peso loans at a lower rate than that
available in Mexico. The notes can be issued with maturities from 30 days to
10 years. The offering is expected to be followed by other Mexican companies
keen to sell peso-denominated debt to foreign investors.
The Mexican government has tapped foreign interest in high-yielding peso
treasury bonds, but Mexican companies have up to now brought in foreign
funds mainly by offering dollar-denominated debt.

FT  14 JUL 93 / International Company News: GM to restrict price increases
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GENERAL Motors yesterday unveiled plans to hold back US vehicle price
increases in the 1994 model year to win back market share.
The company, in the throes of a restructuring to return loss-making North
American operations to profit, said in the 1994 model year, starting in
October, it would expand the 'value pricing' marketing idea it initiated on
some models in 1993.
This involved dropping the price of certain models of vehicles, equipped
with popular levels of optional equipment. The idea is to lift sales and run
GM's factories closer to capacity, to raise profits.
Mr Michael Losh, a GM vice-president, said a value pricing strategy had been
a factor behind the resurgence of GM's North American sales this year.
The company's share of the US passenger car market fell sharply late last
calendar year, to less than 31 per cent, when it cut back sharply on
unprofitable sales to fleet buyers.
However, it has recovered this year and in June totalled 37.1 per cent,
compared with 36.7 per cent a year earlier. However, in the first half of
1993 its car market share was down a point on 1992, at 35.3 per cent.
The recovery has been due partly to value pricing and because Japanese
competitors, hurt by a strong yen, have been increasing their prices faster
than American rivals.
Mr Losh said that in the 1994 model year, GM's prices would rise by 1.5 per
cent, even though they were fitted with additional equipment.
Truck prices would rise by 2.2 per cent and the average price for GM
vehicles would go up about 1.8 per cent - about half the rate of inflation.
However, the proposed price changes do not include the impact of rebates to
consumers given by US car companies to increase sales. Mr Losh said he
expected 1994 rebates to be below those of 1993, but the company would alter
policy in response to competitors.

FT  14 JUL 93 / International Company News: Cox resigns as president of
CSFB's US arm
</HEADLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CS First Boston, the New York-based investment bank, said last night that Mr
Archibald Cox, the president and chief executive of its US operations, had
resigned.
The firm said Mr Cox was leaving for personal reasons, and that his
resignation had been accepted by the board 'with extreme reluctance'.
The news stunned Wall Street, and industry insiders speculated that Mr Cox's
departure was linked to a recent restructuring or to a long-running internal
row at First Boston over employee bonuses, which led to a series of
defections by high-level bankers and traders.
Officials at CSFB and First Boston would not comment, but in a statement Mr
Cox, 53, said: 'I am resigning to seek other personal interests. I feel
strongly that during my tenure at First Boston I have made a meaningful
contribution to the organisation.'
First Boston said Mr Cox would stay on at the firm until September 1. No
successor has been named, and Mr John Hennessy, chief executive of the CSFB
group, will assume Mr Cox's responsibilities.
Mr Cox's departure is the latest upheaval at CSFB, which has recently
reported erratic profits and been dogged by internal rivalries. In March, Mr
Jans-Jorg Rudloff, chairman of the group's European operations, was
appointed to the board of CSFB's majority shareholder, the Zurich-based
financial group CS Holdings, and replaced in London by Mr David Mulford, a
former US Treasury official.
At roughly the same time, Mr Robert Diamond, head of CS First Boston Pacific
in Tokyo, was brought in to run the US bond sales and trading division after
the division's previous head had resigned for personal reasons.
Last month, CSFB said it was consolidating its three units into one group,
and reorganising the business along product, rather than geographic, lines.
The restructuring was seen by some analysts as an implicit acceptance by
CSFB that its ambition to forge a fully-integrated global investment banking
group had failed.

THOMSON-CSF, the French electronics group, is to buy part of the electronic
tubes business of Siemens, the German engineering and electronics company.
The acquisition is part of Thomson's strategy of making European joint
ventures to offset reduced defence expenditure and would consolidate its
position in microwave tubes for telecommunications, the company said.
Thomson will buy Siemens' travelling wave tube and coaxial tube businesses.
Travelling wave tubes are used in telecommunications for radio links and
earth stations while coaxial tubes are used in radar and television
transmission.

NOKIA, the Finnish telecommunications and electronics group, and Mitsui &amp;
Co, the Japanese trading house, have formed a joint venture to market mobile
phones in Japan.
The joint venture, to be established in August, will provide Nokia, the
world's second largest mobile phones maker after Motorola of the US, with a
foothold in the Japanese market.
The Japanese industry is heavily regulated, with mobile phone companies
restricted to leasing equipment.
However, from next April companies will be able to sell mobile phones on the
market.
The industry expects increasing competition from next year when the two
companies will be allowed to offer digital mobile phone services.
Nokia's joint venture in Japan, Nokia Mobile Phone Japan, will also start
marketing handsets for digital mobile telecommunications systems from early
next year.
Nokia will provide two-thirds of the capital of Y300m (Dollars 2.74m) for
the joint venture while Mitsui will provide the remaining Y100m.
Unit sales in the initial year are projected at 40,000 to 50,000 units with
revenues targeted at Y5bn.

FT  14 JUL 93 / International Company News: P&amp;G extends price cuts for
detergents
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PROCTER &amp; Gamble, the US consumer products group facing competition from
low-priced rivals, yesterday announced price cuts of between 3 per cent and
15 per cent on its liquid laundry detergents in the American market.
The cuts, which will be effective on August 2, follow a 9 per cent price
reduction on two of these products late last year and cuts earlier this year
on powdered detergents.
The company said the price cuts would be funded from savings from improved
manufacturing techniques and other non-value added costs. The price cuts
were not expected to affect earnings.
P&amp;G has been moving away from a marketing strategy based on special
promotions to one based on a policy of consistent, but lower prices.
The normally secretive company is holding a rare series of meetings with
analysts and the Press tomorrow where it is expected to outline its strategy
and cost-cutting plans in greater detail.
P&amp;G shares closed last night down Dollars 1 3/8 at Dollars 51 5/8 .
In a separate move, the company named Mr Erik Nelson, a 53-year-old
vice-president of financial operations as chief financial officer, filling a
position vacant since 1991.

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INTERNATIONAL Paper, the US forest products group, yesterday reported a 29.9
per cent drop in underlying second-quarter earnings, reflecting slow
domestic growth and weak overseas economies. The company warned that
weakness in European and export markets would probably continue in the
second half.
Net income for the three months to June 30 was Dollars 77m, or 62 cents a
share, on sales of Dollars 3.5bn compared with earnings of Dollars 112m, or
92 cents, on sales of Dollars 3.4bn a year earlier.
Although earnings per share were higher than most analysts had expected, the
company's shares slipped Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 63 1/8 .
Interest costs were considerably higher in the 1993 period, and in the 1992
quarter International Paper had benefited from tax-related interest income
and higher capitalised interest attributable to two important European
projects.
Stripping out income taxes, extraordinary items and the cumulative effect of
accounting changes, International Paper earned Dollars 122m in the quarter
against Dollars 174m a year earlier.
For the first six months, net income was Dollars 141m, or Dollars 1.14, on
sales of Dollars 6.9bn, against profits of Dollars 164m, or Dollars 1.36, on
sales of Dollars 6.7bn in the same period of 1992.
Packaging operations saw sales decline to Dollars 890m from Dollars 925m,
but the company's other leading business segments posted improved sales.
Mr John Georges, chairman and chief executive, said demand for printing
papers had risen a few percentage points from last year. Increases in
reprographic and coated groundwood papers had been made for the third
quarter.

BRIERLEY Investments has sold its remaining 50.3 per cent shareholding in
Enerco, a New Zealand gas utility, for NZDollars 58.6m (USDollars 32.2m).
Brierley sold a 30 per cent stake for NZDollars 35.2m to a number of
institutions and is selling the remaining 20.3 per cent to Natural Gas
Corporation, the New Zealand utility, for NZDollars 23.4m.
The shares are changing hands for NZDollars 2.09, compared with a current
market price of NZDollars 2.25.
Enerco was publicly floated last year when Brierley sold a 30.4 per cent
shareholding at NZDollars 1.35 a share. A further placement of 19.2 per cent
was made this March.
Mr Paul Collins, Brierley chief executive, said the sale of Enerco shares
was in accordance with forecasts made in the Enerco flotation prospectus.
Telecom Corporation, New Zealand's biggest company, yesterday had its credit
rating downgraded to AA1 by Moody's Investment Services, the US credit
rating agency.
Moody's said the downgrading was due to Telecom's announcement earlier this
year that it intended lowering its cost of capital by reducing the number of
shares on issue and moving to a higher debt gearing ratio.
Mr Jeff White, Telecom chief financial officer, said the company's new debt
ratio of around 40 per cent would still be conservative.
Telecom is 60 per cent owned by Bell Atlantic and Ameritech of the US.
New Zealand's Bancorp Holdings has bought Australian investment bank
International Pacific Securities, which specialises in takeover and
corporate advisory operations.
The new acquisition's operations dovetail with those of Bancorp's in the
area of treasury and financial market advisory services, Bancorp said.
Bancorp is 47 per cent-owned by Public Bank Berhad, the Malaysian investment
bank.

NOKIA, the Finnish telecommunications and electronics group, and Mitsui &amp;

phones in Japan.
The joint venture, to be established in August, will provide Nokia, the
world's second largest mobile phones maker after Motorola of the US, with a

next few years.
The Japanese industry is heavily regulated, with mobile phone companies,

The industry expects increasing competition from next year when the two

Nokia's joint venture in Japan, Nokia Mobile Phone Japan, will also start

Nokia, which is headed by chief executive Mr Jorma Ollila, will provide
two-thirds of the capital of Y300m (Dollars 2.74m) for the joint venture
while Mitsui will provide the remaining Y100m.
Unit sales in the initial year are projected at 40,000 to 50,000 units with
revenues targeted at Y5bn. Nokia expects initially to market its mobile
phones on an original equipment manufacturer basis to telecommunications
companies but plans eventually to sell products under its own brand name.
Nokia has been studying the Japanese market for the past year or so, having
established a mobile phones division in Japan last year.
The Japanese mobile phones market has been held in check by heavy regulation
and high prices which have kept penetration at a low 1.5 per cent of the
population.

<TEXT>
BANCO Nacional de Mexico, (Banamex), Mexico's largest bank, is set to offer
1bn pesos (Dollars 320m) of medium-term notes in the international capital
market, writes Damian Fraser in Mexico City.
It will be the first peso-denominated Euronote offering by a Mexican company
since the country's return to international debt markets in 1989.
Banamex's existing peso debt is rated A grade by Standard &amp; Poor's. The
issue will enable Banamex to fund peso loans at a lower rate than that
available in Mexico. The notes can be issued with maturities from 30 days to
10 years.
The offering is expected to be followed by other Mexican companies keen to
sell peso-denominated, rather than dollar, debt to foreign investors. While
the Mexican government has tapped foreign interest in high-yielding peso
treasury bonds, Mexican companies have up to now brought in foreign funds
mainly by offering dollar-denominated debt.

<TEXT>
NEWS Corporation, Mr Rupert Murdoch's Australian media group, is expanding
its recorded music business with the purchase of a 50 per cent stake in
Mushroom Records, Australia's largest independent recording company.
Announcing the purchase yesterday, Mr Ken Cowley, chief executive of News in
Australia, said the company's wholly-owned Festival Records subsidiary had
acted as Mushroom's main distributor for 20 years and would continue to do
so.
'This new investment is in keeping with our commitment to provide first
class multi-media entertainment and information services,' he said. Mushroom
has annual sales of around ADollars 50m (USDollars 34m)
Mr Michael Gudinski, chairman of Mushroom, said the deal would allow the
company to expand overseas, especially in the US and Britain, with its
stable of recording stars which include Kylie Minogue and Jason Donovan.
Mr Gudinski said the deal would provide valuable links with News
subsidiaries, including Fox Broadcasting, and would bolster Festival
Records' position in a competitive Australian market where top recording
companies have bought out most of the independents.
Mushroom was founded 21 years ago. Mr Gudinski will retain day-to-day
control of the operation.

<TEXT>
EIE International, a Japanese property developer weighed down with debts of
Y700bn (Dollars 4.3bn), plans to restructure without help from its main
bank, Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan, Reuter reports from Tokyo.
On Monday, five leading Japanese banks said that they would halt lending to
EIE. The break with the banks came after a dispute with LTCB which has
Y190bn in loans outstanding to the company.
'We plan to restructure on our own,' an official said. EIE would continue
its important Sanctuary Cove and Bond University projects on the Gold Coast
of Queensland, Australia, he said.
LTCB decided to stop support for EIE after a disagreement over the company's
restructuring plan.
The bank proposed a sharp cutback in EIE's assets including an option of
bankruptcy, but Mr Harunori Takahashi, EIE president, opposed the proposal,
banking industry sources said.
Japanese press reports quoted Mr Takahashi as saying he planned to form a
new restructuring programme as soon as possible. He was reported to be
confident of EIE's restructuring since it 'needs little new money to
continue its business'.
An LTCB spokesman said on Monday that even if the bank sets aside provisions
against bad loans to EIE International, it will try to minimise the impact
on earnings for 1993-1994 by selling its shareholdings.
He denied media reports that LTCB will set aside Y80bn to Y100bn in
1993-1994 in provisions against bad loans to EIE.

COMALCO, the Australian aluminium producer, is to buy a further 20 per cent
stake in the Boyne Island smelter in Queensland for about ADollars 200m
(USDollars 136m) from Metall Aktiengesellschaft, the Austrian metals group.
The purchase would lift Comalco's interest in the smelter to 50 per cent and
comes as the company is close to a decision on adding a new potline which
would lift annual aluminium capacity by about 85 per cent.
Construction of the new potline, being considered despite the glut in world
aluminium supplies, would add about 200,000 tonnes to the smelter's annual
capacity of 230,000 tonnes of primary metal.
Mr Nick Stump, Comalco chief executive, said the proportion of ownership in
the new potline was still under discussion with remaining shareholders - a
consortium of five Japanese companies.
Deliberations also included arrangements for electric power for the smelter
from the Gladstone power station, controlled by the Queensland government,
and a decision was expected by the end of 1993.
One option being considered by the company is outright purchase of the
Gladstone power station. Comalco is also involved in talks on power supplies
to the two other smelters it controls, at Bell Bay in Tasmania and at Tiwai
Point in New Zealand.
'This (purchase) decision is consistent with Comalco's previously announced
strategy to concentrate its future investment in the upstream (bauxite to
metal) sector of the aluminium industry,' Mr Stump said. 'The additional
supply will allow Comalco to service its increasing customer base in export
markets.'
Mr Stump said AMAG, which is controlled by the Austrian government, had
expressed a wish to end its interest in the smelter early this year as part
of a plan to focus more closely on the company's European fabricating
operations.
The smelter, which began production in 1982, operates under a consortium
tolling arrangement with participants taking metal in line with their equity
shares. AMAG has been a partner since 1989.
The acquisition includes AMAG's shares in the smelter, working capital and
other funding obligations attached to the interest. The purchase price is
subject to minor adjustments and to approval from the Foreign Investment
Review Board.

THYSSEN STAHL and Krupp-Hoesch Stahl, Germany's two largest steel makers,
yesterday confirmed that they were holding talks about co-operation in their
tin plate divisions but denied any intention to merge their operations.
This follows a report in a Ruhr valley newspaper that the companies might
consider merging their tin plate productions to gain economies of scale and
reduce costs.
Spokesmen from both companies said that talks regarding production, research
and development were taking place but described them as routine.
Hoesch Stahl, which merged with Krupp Stahl at the beginning of the year,
produces annually 300,000 tonnes of tin plate products in its Westfalenhutte
plant in Dortmund.
Thyssen Stahl's Rasselstein subsidiary in Neuwied, near Koblenz, produces
700,000 tonnes of tin plate products a year.

A NEW general licence permitting automatic repatriation of interest earnings
by foreigners which comes into force in Poland on July 15 aims to generate
demand abroad for three-year treasury bonds as well as treasury bills.
The three-year bonds as well as the 26, 39 and 52-week treasury bills
available to foreign investors since the middle of last year have met with
minimal success since repatriation of earnings has required special central
bank permits for each tranche.
The government has sought to place 7,000bn zlotys (Dollars 407m) worth of
three-year treasury bonds since last August but so far only 2,500bn zlotys
worth have been taken up by domestic investors.
In the first quarter of this year the annual yield on the three-year
treasury bonds was 43 per cent while the country's current 'crawling peg'
mechanism is devaluing the zloty at a rate of 25 per cent a year.
Year-on-year inflation is running at 36 per cent.
Poland's first cement sector privatisation has taken place with the sale of
the Odra works in Opole to Miebach Projektgesellschaft of Germany for DM6m
(Dollars 3.38m). Miebach plans to invest a further DM31m to modernise the
Polish plant.

IBM is moving to capitalise more broadly upon its Risc (reduced instruction
set computing) technology for high performance microprocessors with the
introduction yesterday of a powerful Risc desktop server computer for use in
networks of workstations, writes Louise Kehoe in San Francisco.
The company also unveiled several new data storage products from its Adstar
business unit, that provide faster access to data and reduce storage costs
for workstation users.
IBM announced price reductions of up to 34 per cent on a range of Risc
System/6000 workstations and peripherals. The new server is priced in the US
at Dollars 13,200.

FT  14 JUL 93 / International Company News: GE ahead at Dollars 1.3bn for
quarter - Strong performances from financial services and power systems
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
GENERAL Electric, the diversified US manufacturing and services group,
yesterday reported a 10 per cent increase in net earnings for the second
quarter.
The group benefited from strong operating performances at its financial
services and power systems businesses.
The company reported earnings of Dollars 1.33bn, or Dollars 1.56 a share,
compared with Dollars 1.21bn, or Dollars 1.42, in the same period of last
year.
Revenues rose by 4 per cent to Dollars 14.8bn.
The figures were slightly ahead of the Wall Street consensus and GE shares
closed Dollars  5/8 higher at Dollars 98 on the New York Stock Exchange
yesterday.
The quarter's results were distorted by the company's disposal of its
aerospace business in April to Martin Marietta, also of the US.
It recorded a Dollars 678m, or 79 cents a share, after-tax gain on the sale
which Mr Jack Welch, the chairman, said had been used to fund restructuring
operations to enhance operations.
The one-time restructuring charge of 79 cents a share was classified as a
reduction of continuing operations and the gain on the sale was classified
as an increase in discontinued operations.
This meant that net earnings from continuing operations totalled Dollars
656m, or 77 cents a share, down 42 per cent, in spite of the 10 per cent
gain at the net level.
Mr Welch said that the operating margin for the quarter was a record 14.2
per cent, compared with 12.8 per cent a year ago.
Earnings at GE Capital Services, the financial services group, were 19 per
cent ahead of 1992, with 16 of its 23 subsidiaries having record first-half
earnings, including Kidder Peabody, its once-troubled securities house.
Power systems recorded 'much higher' on-going operating profit on higher
revenues, due to a strong performance by the power generation business.
Aircraft engines had flat operating profits on a considerable drop in
revenues.
However, the company said that lower shipments of engines and spare parts
were somewhat mitigated by revenues associated with the consolidation of a
recently-acquired engine maintenance and management services business in
Wales.

FT  14 JUL 93 / International Company News: PaineWebber advances 30%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PAINEWEBBER, the US securities house, yesterday reported that second-quarter
profits climbed to Dollars 59.3m, up 30 per cent on the Dollars 45.8m earned
in the same period a year ago.
Revenues in the three months totalled Dollars 686.5m, compared with Dollars
592.1m in the second quarter of 1992.
The strong quarter took PaineWebber's half-yearly profits to a record
Dollars 130.2m. In the first six months of 1992 it earned Dollars 120.1m.
PaineWebber said revenues from its four main areas of business - brokerage
commissions, principal transactions, investment banking and asset management
 -all rose during the quarter.
The biggest contribution, apart from interest income, came from commission
revenues, which rose 23 per cent to Dollars 239.9m as investor demand for
securities products remained strong.
Earnings from principal transactions - the firm's trading for its clients
and its own account - climbed 8 per cent to Dollars 182.7m, while investment
banking revenues edged 5 per cent higher to Dollars 95.8m.
Asset management revenues, meanwhile, rose 19 per cent, to 77.4m as client
assets under PaineWebber's control climbed from Dollars 107.4bn a year ago
to Dollars 127.8bn. Net interest income rose 19 per cent to Dollars 328.1m.
Non-interest expenses were Dollars 589.2m, up sharply from a year earlier
because of a big rise in performance-related employee compensation.
The results had little impact on PaineWebber's shares, which eased Dollars
1/8 to Dollars 29 at the close in New York. In spite of the decline, the
stock remained close to its 52-week high.
Bear Stearns, the Wall Street securities house, yesterday announced the
appointment of Mr James Cayne, the firm's president, as chief executive. Mr
Alan Greenberg, chairman, said the move was a recognition of Mr Cayne's
contributions to the company.

FT  14 JUL 93 / International Company News: Merrill Lynch posts 53% rise to
Dollars 345m at halfway
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE BIG Wall Street securities house Merrill Lynch yesterday announced a 53
per cent jump in second-quarter profits to a record Dollars 345m, on total
revenues of Dollars 3.97bn.
The strong second quarter took the firm's six-month earnings total to
Dollars 687m, well ahead of the Dollars 443.7m reported in the first half of
1992.
Over the past two years Wall Street has enjoyed an unprecedented boom in
stockbroking and investment banking business because of low US interest
rates and heavy demand from investors for stocks and bonds.
The firm is the largest retail broker in the US, and in the second quarter
its commission revenues (including commissions from the sale of mutual
funds) totalled Dollars 666m, up from Dollars 568.8m in the same period a
year ago.
Merrill also leads Wall Street in stock and bond underwriting with an 18.4
per cent share of the domestic market, and earnings from investment banking
climbed 4 per cent in the quarter to Dollars 414m, due primarily to higher
revenues from corporate debt underwritings.
As one the country's largest asset managers, with Dollars 148bn of client
assets under fee-based management and more than Dollars 500bn in total
client assets in the firm's custody, Merrill earned Dollars 240m in asset
management and custodial fees, up 11 per cent from a year earlier.
Its largest source of income, however, remained principal transactions - the
trading the firm does for its clients and its own account - which brought in
Dollars 734m in the quarter, up 33 per cent on 1992 thanks to strong
revenues from the trading of corporate equities, swaps and derivatives,
corporate bonds and currencies.
The final component of earnings, net interest and dividend income, rose 20
per cent to Dollars 279m, due partly to higher levels of interest-earning
assets and favourable interest rate spreads.
On the cost side, Merrill's non-interest expenses climbed 13 per cent to
Dollars 1.97bn following an 18 per cent jump to Dollars 1.28bn in
compensation and benefits payments, which are tied to the firm's
profitability.
Although the news of strong second-quarter earnings provided an initial lift
to Merrill's stock, when the share price reached a new 52-week high of
Dollars 86 1/8 mid-morning, investors began to sell and take profits, so by
the close the stock was quoted at Dollars 84 5/8, down Dollars 1.

CPC International, the US foods group, expects earnings to improve in the
second half and to outpace the Dollars 1.34 per share earned in the first
six months of 1993, Reuter reports from New York.
Mr Fred Meendsen, CPC vice-president, declined after a meeting with analysts
to make a specific forecast on full-year earnings. He added, however, that
the company was 'not significantly uncomfortable' with Wall Street estimates
of earnings between Dollars 2.95 and Dollars 3 for all of 1993.
CPC posted second quarter net income of Dollars 116.9m, or 76 cents a share,
compared with Dollars 111.3m, or 72 cents a share, a year earlier.

FT  14 JUL 93 / International Company News: Hilton hit by lack of 'high
rollers'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A SHORTAGE of 'high rollers' - gamblers willing to bet the largest stakes -
at the Las Vegas Hilton contributed to a second-quarter decline in net
income for Hilton, the hotels and gaming group, to Dollars 26.8m, or Dollars
0.56 a share, from Dollars 32.4m, or Dollars 0.68 a share, in the same
period in 1992.
A strong rise in operating income from gaming had helped Hilton to shrug off
flat operating revenues from its hotels division in 1992 and the first
quarter of 1993.
In the three months to June 30, however, operating income from gaming fell
slightly, to Dollars 37.4m from Dollars 37.5m.
The company blamed the result on a lack of gamblers placing large stakes at
the tables in the Las Vegas Hilton, although it said the Flamingo Hilton in
Las Vegas and its two hotel-casinos in Reno, Nevada, had done well.
The hotels division recorded unchanged operating income, at Dollars 29.7m.
Continuing weakness in New York and Hawaii, and industry-wide pressure on
rates, had accounted for the result, Hilton said. The hotel occupancy rate
rose by one point, to 70 per cent, compared with the same quarter in 1992,
but average room rates fell in a number of areas.
Turnover rose 17 per cent to Dollars 345.2m from Dollars 294.8m. Net income
was struck after financing charges to Dollars 17.7m, up from Dollars 13.2m
due to the Dollars 300m of extra borrowing taken on last year to finance
further casino developments.
Hilton said that it had accelerated its development of casinos in New
Orleans and Kansas City, both of which were expected to open in the first
quarter of 1994.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TRANS World Airline, the bankrupt US carrier, yesterday named Mr William
Howard as chairman when the company emerges from Chapter 11 bankruptcy
protection later this summer.
As a result of the appointment, tomorrow's US bankruptcy court hearing to
confirm TWA's reorganisation plans has been postponed to August 11.
TWA has been operating under Chapter 11 since January 1992.
The company said yesterday that more than 90 per cent of each of its
unsecured creditor classes had voted in favour of reorganisation.
TWA's unions and creditors have been pressing for an experienced outsider to
help lead the company. Attempts to woo Mr Lee Iacocca, former head of
Chrysler, failed late last year.
Mr Howard, 71, is credited with the success of Piedmont Airlines which he
headed in the 1980s.
He is popular with labour groups - which is important since TWA's unions
will own 45 per cent of the re-organised common stock and have four seats on
the board.
Mr Howard left Piedmont in 1987, when it was acquired by USAir.
Mr Howard faces a daunting task. Competition remains fierce, and TWA has
lost some of its most valuable routes, such as New York-Heathrow which was
sold by Mr Carl Icahn, TWA's former owner, in 1991.
Mr Glenn Zander and Mr Robin Wilson, TWA's two chief executives, will remain
with the company as vice-chairmen.

FT  14 JUL 93 / International Company News: AT&amp;T's new battle call in US
phone war
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN INTENSE marketing battle between American Telephone &amp; Telegraph and MCI
Communications for US long-distance telephone customers took a novel turn
yesterday when AT&amp;T trumpeted it had invented a method of 'dramatically
improving' the sound quality of calls over its network.
It said the new system made long-distance calls sound clearer, closer and
more natural by boosting the base end of a call's sound spectrum. But the
claim was immediately dismissed as a 'marketing gimmick' by an MCI
spokesman, who added: 'It's not of any concern to us.'
The new sound - called TrueVoice - is the latest of many attempts by
America's largest long distance operators - AT&amp;T, MCI and Sprint - to add
brand value to what is essentially a commodity service.
As if to underline that point, some of AT&amp;T's self-promotion yesterday
sounded remarkably similar to an advertisement for toothpaste or pet food.
Mr Merrill Tutton, president of the group's consumer communications
services, said research studies of AT&amp;T, Sprint and MCI customers had shown
that 'eight out of 10 people surveyed preferred the sound quality of AT&amp;T
TrueVoice to current long-distance sound quality'.
He claimed that TrueVoice 'does for the telecommunications industry what the
digital compact disc did for the recording business'.
However, some journalists who were among the first to hear the new system
felt if it did represent any improvement in sound quality, then this was
incremental rather than a fundamental breakthrough.
AT&amp;T, the largest US long distance company, certainly needs to bolster its
market position, for MCI, the second largest carrier, has been taking share
from it through marketing initiatives.
MCI has about 18 per cent of the long distance market, against 60 per cent
for AT&amp;T and 9 per cent for Sprint.
AT&amp;T said it would begin introducing TrueVoice in some parts of the US in
September and would complete deployment across the nation by the end of
1994.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CIGA, the troubled luxury hotels chain which is controlled by the Aga Khan,
suffered a 4.9 per cent fall in revenues in the first half as the recession
bit into occupancy rates.
Turnover fell to L206.8bn (Dollars 88m) from L217.6bn, with the steepest
fall in Spain where room occupancy sank to just 38 per cent.
By contrast, sales and occupancy in the big Italian market improved
slightly.
Ciga's latest figures come as a Milan judge decides today whether to approve
a court order in late May freezing the Aga Khan's stake in Ciga, which is
held through his quoted Fimpar holding company. The court decision,
postponed from early June, follows a legal action by the German subsidiary
of the IMI financial services group, which led a Dollars 100m loan to
Fimpar.
As a result of the freeze, trading in Ciga and Fimpar shares has been
suspended for the past seven weeks. Ciga's shareholders' meeting yesterday
elected two court-appointed representatives to its board, which has been
slimmed down to seven from 12 members. The two members will represent the
interests of the IMI-led bank consortium pending resolution of the dispute.
Ciga gave no precise earnings forecast for this year in view of the
difficult trading conditions. However, it said that it expected operating
earnings to be in line with the L23.9bn made before interest in 1992.
Having reduced costs to ensure break-even at occupancy levels of about 50
per cent, the group maintained it was well placed to benefit from any
recovery.
Net group debts reached L1,101bn, including unpaid interest, at the end of
last month, against L972bn at the end of December 1992.
Financial charges amounted to L196.3bn in 1992, with interest costs
accounting for about L125bn and an additional burden of L71bn arising from
the effect of the lira devaluation on Ciga's foreign currency borrowing.

PUMA, the troubled German-based sports goods manufacturer, suffered a

The company recorded a small profit in 1991 after five consecutive years of
losses. It confirmed that there would be no 1992 dividend.
Group sales for 1992 fell from DM577.1m to DM512.9m.
Including licensed sales, worldwide sales for the Puma label were DM1.17bn
last year, down from DM1.29bn in 1991.
Mr Jochen Zeitz, the group's chief executive, said that the company had
suffered from the decline in the price of sportswear and high marketing
costs.

MOTOROLA, the US electronics and semiconductor manufacturer, reported record
second-quarter earnings, matching Wall Street expectations.
Net income rose 57 per cent to Dollars 224m, or 81 cents a share, from
Dollars 143m, or 53 cents, fully diluted. Revenues were Dollars 3.9bn, up 25
per cent from the Dollars 3.1bn of the same period last year. Net profit
margins on sales were 5.7 per cent, against 4.6 per cent a year ago.
Semiconductor sales advanced 28 per cent to Dollars 1.39bn, with orders up
30 per cent at an all-time high, the company said.
The general systems group, which includes telecommunications equipment, had
sales of Dollars 1.18bn, up 40 per cent from the second quarter of 1992.
In the communications segment, including land mobile products and the paging
and wireless data group, sales rose 23 per cent to Dollars 1.13bn.
Demand for Motorola's semiconductors, communications products and electronic
equipment continued to increase throughout most of the world, even in
regions such as Europe, where economic conditions remain sluggish, said Mr
George Fisher, chairman and chief executive.
For the half-year, sales reached Dollars 7.56bn, up from Dollars 6.2bn in
the first half of 1992. Earnings were Dollars 428m, or Dollars 1.58 a share,
against Dollars 268m, or Dollars 1.01, before the cumulative effect of a
1992 accounting change related to insurance benefits. Fully-diluted earnings
per share were Dollars 1.53, up from 99 cents a year earlier.

FT  14 JUL 93 / International Company News: Medco confirms merger talks with
drugs groups
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A REALIGNMENT of drug distribution in the US, giving pharmaceutical
companies greater control over sales to their biggest buyers, could be under
way following news of merger talks involving one of the country's largest
distributors.
Medco Containment Services, a fast-growing mail-order supplier, said it was
in talks with several pharmaceutical companies which could lead to strategic
relationships, partnerships, joint ventures or business combination.
Mr Martin Wygod, chairman and chief executive, said the statement was
prompted by a report yesterday that Medco had been in talks about a Dollars
4.5bn merger with Merck, the largest US drugs company. Merck's
recently-appointed president, Mr Richard Markham, resigned unexpectedly on
Friday.
Medco supplies pharmaceuticals to the employees of many of the largest US
companies, including General Motors and General Electric, under their
company health plans.
The company is the largest mail order company for pharmaceuticals in the US
and last year controlled more than half of the US mail order market, worth
about Dollars 3.8bn a year. Its closest competitor, Baxter Prescriptions, a
division of Baxter International, has about 10 per cent of the market.
Medco represents 1,550 companies and public agencies, covering 33m employees
and by buying in bulk it claims to achieve discounts from pharmaceutical
companies of between 20 per cent and 40 per cent. Mr Wygod estimated that it
would account for drug purchases worth Dollars 7bn-Dollars 8bn this year, or
12 per cent of drug sales in the US.
He refused to comment on whether Medco had been in talks with Merck, or
whether a tie-up with one pharmaceutical company was the most likely
outcome.
'We're trying to make the right types of relationships with manufacturers to
help cut back healthcare bills,' he said.
However, consultants questioned the strategy of pharmaceuticals companies
buying their customers. 'This makes little sense. If Merck acquired Medco,
they would be buying only 2 per cent of the non-hospital market at a huge
cost,' said Mr Eran Broshy, head of the Boston Consulting Group's healthcare
practice.
The growth of bulk buying by Medco and other institutional purchasers of
pharmaceuticals has contributed to pressure on drug companies' profits, and
put control of distribution into the hands of a group of intermediaries who
have grown up between the drug companies and the users of their products.
A tie-up with a distributor such as Medco would give a company greater
control over sales of its drugs. However, Medco's relationships with its
customers could suffer if it became a sales channel for the products of one
company.
Medco, based in Montvale, New Jersey, had achieved compound sales growth of
more than 35 per cent a year in the past eight years, said Mr Wygod. In
early trading, its shares rose Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 31 1/4 but slipped
to Dollars 30 1/8 by the close.

FT  14 JUL 93 / International Company News: Deckel Maho sees benefits in
three years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE first fruits of the merger of German machine tool makers Friedrich
Deckel and Maho are expected in three years when the slimmed-down company
should return to profit.
According to Mr Bodo Viets, Maho chairman, a loss of DM100m (Dollars 62.5m)
is expected in the first year, and the first two years' results will be
burdened by restructuring costs totalling DM240m. These will include charges
for closures, removals and the cost of reducing the workforce.
However, cost savings worth DM120m a year will have a beneficial effect from
1995 onwards, according to a merger report published yesterday. The new
company, to be called Deckel Maho, expects turnover in the year to June 30
1994 of between DM400m and DM500m with the workforce cut to about 1,500
people.
The figures suggest heavy capacity cuts, which have not yet been decided.
Last year's combined sales came to DM750m with a workforce of more than
3,000 people down from almost 6,000 in 1989-90.
The merger of two of Germany's best-known and most troubled machine tool
makers was engineered by banks, led by Deutsche Bank, which have a
controlling stake in Maho. Mr Rolf Breuer, a senior Deutsche Bank director,
was recently appointed chairman of the Maho supervisory board. The new
company will be majority-owned by Walter Eder, an engineering group which
controls Deckel.
Prime aim of the deal is to construct a group with the necessary critical
mass and a strong home base from which it can hope to fight off the
Japanese, Germany's main international competitors. Deckel and Maho have
between them up to 40 per cent of the German market in boring and milling
machines.
The deal indirectly involves Gildemeister, a leading operator in the sector,
which last January founded a joint distribution company with Deckel.

FT  14 JUL 93 / International Company News: GMF offers Fnac stake options
</HEADLINE>

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE future of Fnac became clearer yesterday when GMF, the French insurance
company said Credit Lyonnais, the French bank, and Compagnie Generale des
Eaux, the water and energy group, would be granted an option to buy a
controlling stake in the French retailer.
Credit Lyonnais and Compagnie Generale des Eaux have the option, until
October 11, to acquire 54.78 per cent of the shares in Fnac at FFr2,928 per
share.
This values Fnac at FFr2.4bn (Dollars 444m).
Fnac's shares, which have climbed sharply from a level of about FFr2,200 two
weeks ago, were suspended yesterday at FFr3,208.
Analysts in Paris said that the deal was a financial transaction to provide
capital for GMF, a mutual insurance company, and to maintain French
ownership of Fnac. They said that the October deadline gave GMF the
opportunity to find alternative sources of capital and maintain control of
the group.
GMF has been seeking fresh capital as a result of losses in a property
venture in the Dutch Antilles and in its travel insurance business.
Pressure on GMF to sell part or all of its 80 per cent stake in Fnac has
prompted interest from several European retailing groups, including
Berthelsmann of Germany and Printemps of France.
'Fnac is a attractive asset,' said Mr Anthony West, retail analyst at
Enskilda Research in Paris.
'It has had a chequered history in terms of ownership, but has a strong
position in urban retailing and is a dominant force in the French records
and books market.'
Fnac reported sales of about FFr6.96bn in the first three-quarters of its
financial year, an increase of 7.9 per cent over the corresponding period
last year.
Net profits for the year to the end of August are expected to increase by
about 11 per cent to FFr92m.
Credit Lyonnais has acquired the option to buy the majority of the 54.8 per
cent of the shares through Altus, a financial subsidiary. Compagnie Generale
des Eaux is taking the option to buy the shares through Immobiliere Phoenix,
a property subsidiary.
French takeover law states that if the two companies take up their options
to buy the controlling stake in Fnac, they must extend the offer to minority
shareholders in the company.

growth

<TEXT>
ROCHE, the Swiss healthcare and chemicals group, yesterday reported sales
for the first six months up 8 per cent to SFr7.15bn (Dollars 5.1bn) from
SFr6.62bn. In local currencies the increase was 10 per cent. The company
does not publish half-year profit figures.
The company said it expected sales to continue to improve during the second
half of the year and that barring unforeseen circumstances, particularly in
foreign exchange rates, the group should post a significant increase on last
year's net income of SFr1.9bn.
Much of the first-half growth was generated by the pharmaceuticals division
which reported sales up 12 per cent to SFr1.59bn from SFr1.56bn. Excluding
exchange rates, the increase was 14 per cent.
The company said the German healthcare reforms introduced in January - which
have led to a 13 per cent fall in the market for the first four months - had
little impact. Turnover in Italy during the first half improved in spite of
the fall in the market following reforms introduced in April. Roche said it
expected sales in both Italy and Germany to increase this year.
The vitamins and fine chemicals unit lifted sales 2 per cent to SFr1.59bn
from SFr1.56bn.

FT  14 JUL 93 / International Company News: Dutch bank finds a second home -
ABN Amro's dollars 500m acquisition of Cragin Federal, a Chicago-based
savings bank, will make it Illinois' second-largest retail bank. Roland van
de Krol reports from Amsterdam on ABN's 14-year-pold strategy

<TEXT>
A similarity between the Netherlands and the US Midwest is the flatness of
the terrain. Another, less visible link, is the prominent role played by ABN
Amro, the Netherlands' largest bank, in the state of Illinois and its
capital, Chicago.
Last week, the bank announced that it would be putting the finishing touches
to a 14-year-old strategy of carving out a second home market in this
important region of the Midwest.
ABN Amro's planned Dollars 500m acquisition of Cragin Federal, a savings
bank with roots in Chicago's wealthy north-western suburbs, marks its
biggest foreign acquisition in value terms.
The move lifts its local offices by 27 to 90 and raises its savings and
deposits in Illinois to Dollars 2bn, making ABN Amro the state's
second-largest retail bank after home-grown First Chicago.
The acquisition, due to take place early next year, is the latest in a
Dollars 1.6bn series of purchases in Illinois since 1979. Earlier
acquisitions have included LaSalle National, Lane Financial, Exchange
Bancorp and Talman Home Federal.
Besides this local operation, the Dutch group maintains 10 ABN Amro offices
in the US and Canada from which it serves top corporate customers. It owns
European American Bank on New York's Long Island.
Mr Jan Kalff, the board member responsible for ABN Amro's push into Illinois
for the past nine years, says he has no designs on further acquisitions in
Illinois. 'We'll leave it at this for the time being,' he says. 'We are not
looking any further in the Chicago area.'
He acknowledges that ABN Amro has said this before, most recently after the
Talman acquisition in 1992. The fact that the Dutch bank has returned once
again to the familiar territory of Chicago testifies to the region's
economic resilience, the fragmentation of its banking market and the
prospect of achieving savings on operating costs at Cragin.
ABN Amro plans to farm out Cragin's administrative operations to a service
centre run by its LaSalle group of banks near Chicago's O'Hare airport.
This, plus a cut in staff at headquarters, should help ABN Amro realise the
30 per cent reduction in costs that is regarded as a rule of thumb in US
banking acquisitions. 'If that happens at Cragin, and we'll have to wait and
see, that would mean savings of Dollars 12m to Dollars 15m,' Mr Kalff says.
Another lure for ABN Amro was the strength of the economy in and around
Chicago. The region has escaped the deep recession that has scarred the
north-east and California, exhibiting steady growth rather than a
boom-and-bust cycle.
ABN Amro's decision in 1979 to focus on Chicago was due in part to the
fiercer competition among foreign banks in New York and California, and also
in part to admiration for the Midwest's economy. Looking back on the LaSalle
acquisition, Mr Kalff notes, 'In retrospect, it was a fortunate move, not
only because the bank itself was attractive but the entire region is very
attractive.'
Financing for Cragin is easy to arrange as ABN Amro will be paying one-third
to one-half of the Dollars 500m acquisition price in dollar-denominated
preferred stock issued by LaSalle, just as it did for Lane, Exchange and
Talman. Dividends on these instruments are low as they are linked to US
interest rates, and the dollar funding means that the parent bank does not
run any currency risk.
A final reason to return to Chicago was the sense that regional banks such
as Banc One and National Bank of Detroit will be stepping up their
involvement in Illinois, whose splintered banking market numbers more than
1,000 banks.
Most of the rest are small, but Cragin represented the second-largest
independent savings bank after the leader, St Paul. 'I wanted to be ahead of
the others,' Mr Kalff says.
ABN Amro's concerted expansion since the late 1970s has left it with a
significant critical mass in the local market, creating important economies
of scale. This is a situation which the bank would find difficult, if not
impossible, to replicate in EAB's home market on Long Island, which is
dominated by five or six of New York's biggest banks.
Similarly, Europe poses very different challenges. ABN Amro, which has a
network of offices in each of the European Community states, is searching
for local acquisitions in France, Belgium and Germany, but the power of
domestic banks and the prices commanded by acquisition targets are barriers
to success.
One solution may be to take a regional approach in a country such as
Germany. 'It could well be that you buy something in North Rhine-Westphalia
or in the north around Hamburg or in the south, where we'd at least be able
to create a strong local base without necessarily covering all of Germany
from the very start,' Mr Kalff says.
Still, any acquisition in a European state is bound to take longer to pay
off financially than the most recent one in the state of Illinois. 'In
Europe and elsewhere in the world, it is extremely difficult to buy
something which immediately contributes to results in the first year,' he
says.

FT  14 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Putting all the potatoes into one frying
basket - Bensons Crisps' plan to centralise its production
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR SIDNEY Benson was not the kind of man to let the second world war deprive
the people of Wigan of their crisps.
When Smiths, virtually the only UK volume crisp maker in the 1940s, slashed
production because of a wartime shortage of vegetable oil, the fish and chip
shop proprietor used lard to make his own, and Bensons crisps were born.
Today Bensons Crisps is the fourth-largest quoted savoury snack maker in a
UK market, worth about Pounds 1.4bn. The company, however, has recently
launched an ambitious investment programme to try to secure its future.
It is moving the bulk of its production from three factories and a warehouse
in Kirkham, Lancashire, to a purpose built plant nearby to increase output
and raise efficiency to match that of its much larger competitors.
Bensons believes it will be one of the most efficient snack producers in the
country when production begins at the end of this year.
The investment will total about Pounds 9.7m, funded by a Pounds 5.3m rights
issue topped up by lease finance.
The plant will help Bensons, which ceased to be a family-owned business in
the late 1970s, to overcome its main problem - lack of size.
It claims a 5 per cent market share compared with the top three crisp
makers, which are all multinationals.
Pepsico and United Biscuits are vying for market leadership, and both claim
more than 40 per cent. Dalgety comes a clear third with 13 per cent.
Without the efficiency gains from volume production available to its larger
rivals, the company's capacity to remain competitive is questionable. With
operations split between two factories and a warehouse site in Kirkham and
one factory in Newport, Gwent, the question marks over its future had
multiplied.
Then also, in the late-1980s, the market began changing rapidly and Bensons
did not. Consumers moved away from the company's tradi-tional sales ground
of independent retailers selling single packets of crisps and began choosing
instead lower margin multipacks sold through supermarkets. The big multiples
now account for almost 50 per cent of retail sales.
In 1992 pre-tax profit margins were 1.5 per cent, against 6.9 per cent in
1989. Pre-tax profits dropped to Pounds 500,000 from Pounds 1m in 1991 while
turnover advanced more than a quarter to Pounds 33.2m.
Over the past five years Bensons has seen a number of independent operators
absorbed by larger competitors. Mr Malcolm Jones, managing director,
considered but then abandoned the idea of selling up.
He says: 'We knew we would have to do something, and we really had two
options: sell up, or invest in a greenfield site. We chose to invest. It is
the option that is four times harder, but we think it could be more than
four times as rewarding for shareholders and employees.'
Bensons has spent more than Pounds 5m in the past six years on re-equipping,
and will transfer much of that machinery to the new plant.
The total investment, however, is less than three quarters the sum that the
Snack Factory, a privately-owned company 40 miles away, has spent on a
greenfield plant in Skelmersdale, which it claims is Europe's most efficient
snack producer.
Bensons' new 9.8 acre site will allow for improved materials flow and
greater capacity. It will replace, for example, an existing 700kg per hour
fryer with one that can handle 2,000kg per hour. The fryer will feed
automated packaging systems which can respond flexibly to the order flow.
Bensons hopes the greater efficiency will allow it to make cost savings of
between 10 and 13 per cent, or roughly Pounds 1m a year. The new facility
should mean a changed sales mix.
It now sells 40 per cent of its turnover to supermarkets, another 10 per
cent of sales are made through van rounds, with the remaining 50 per cent to
wholesale cash and carry businesses.
It is negotiating with the big multiples and says it has had encouraging
signals about increasing supplies.
When the new plant is in operation Bensons expects 60 per cent of its
turnover will go to supermarkets, with 40 per cent sold through the
independent sector.
It is a bold strategy, which although based on sound assumptions about how
technology can improve efficiency, depends crucially on factors which
Bensons, like everyone else in the market, cannot control.
It will remain vulnerable, though, to aggressive pricing by a small number
of large competitors and the significant price pressures exerted by the
leading multiples.
Bensons argues, however, that its increased competitiveness will mitigate
the effect of external pressures.
Mr John Hase, savoury snack specialist with PA Consulting Group, said: 'It
is a very competitive business and the big players are very serious,
particularly Pepsico and United Biscuits, about dominating the market.
With competition like that it will not be an easy job to carve out and
maintain an adequate and profitable market share.'

TRIPLEX LLOYD, the industrial engineering group, announced pre-tax profits
of Pounds 7.08m for the year to last March, a fractional improvement on last
time's Pounds 7.07m.
Earnings per share were 9.8p, down from 10.9p as the diluting effects of
February's 1-for-4 rights issue came into play. As promised then, the final
dividend is 4.5p, maintaining the total at 7p.
While engineering turnover declined from Pounds 55.4m to Pounds 47.6m and
operating profits fell sharply from Pounds 2.1m to Pounds 763,000, the power
division's turnover rose from Pounds 57.3m to Pounds 69.1m and produced
operating profits ahead from Pounds 4.41m to Pounds 5.56m.
As operating profits of the automotive division were scarcely changed at
Pounds 3.73m, on turnover of Pounds 46.8m (Pounds 42.8m) it meant that the
power division, where investment has been concentrated, was the single most
important factor in holding up profits.
'We see immediate growth opportunities for our power division both
organically and by acquisition,' said Mr Colin Cooke, chairman.
COMMENT
Triplex Lloyd's immediate future is mixed: bright for the power division,
not too bad for automotive, although that depends on winning market share,
and dull for general engineering and building products. In fact, with so
much investment going into power and a large proportion of profits coming
from it, the building products business looks more and more uncomfortable in
the group. The shares are not a buy for immediate gain, because profits
growth from current heavy investment will not show through strongly until
1995-96. Given the mixed prospects, pre-tax profits for this year may not
top Pounds 8.5m and earnings could slip back to about 9p. That would put the
shares on a prospective p/e of more than 19, high enough for any but the
most patient.

FT  14 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Birse deficit hits Pounds 18.5m as
recession bites
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BIRSE GROUP, the building and civil engineering company in which Bilfinger &amp;
Berger, the German contractor, has a 15 per cent stake, incurred a Pounds
18.5m pre-tax loss during the 12 months to end-April.
The deficit compared with a Pounds 12.3m loss the previous year. Turnover
fell by 7.9 per cent from Pounds 356.1m to Pounds 328.4m. Losses per share
widened from 15.3p to 22.3p.
The loss was struck after provisions of Pounds 3.48m against the group's
commercial property operations. That was only slightly lower than the Pounds
3.67m provisions made against commercial property in 1991-92.
Mr Peter Birse, chairman, said the company had suffered from a severe
recession in all its markets.
The company has net debt of Pounds 27m, more than twice shareholders' funds
of Pounds 12.5m. It recently renegotiated its loan agreements, rescheduling
its short term borrowings 'on a committed three year basis to May 1996.'
Mr Birse said the agreement with the banks had given the group a firm
foundation from which to reduce its borrowings through an orderly sale of
its commercial property interests valued at Pounds 35m.
Its contracting operations last year incurred a loss of about Pounds 9m
compared with a deficit of Pounds 5m the previous year. Commercial property
ran up a loss of Pounds 4m after provisions (Pounds 3.1m); plant hire profit
fell from Pounds 1.5m to Pounds 1m while house building made a similar loss
to the previous year of Pounds 1.5m.
Mr Birse said that the construction division had suffered from low margins
on contracts and delays in receiving payments on long term projects. He
expected this position to improve in the current year.
House sales by the company had risen by 25 per cent last year but the
division had suffered from weaker house prices.
COMMENT
The preparedness of banks, led by Midland, to support Birse is good news for
its British and German shareholders. The company's survival looks assured
provided there are no nasty surprises to upset its recuperation. Birse,
however, is unlikely to make a quick return to robust health. Contracting is
likely to remain a difficult market while housebuilding - expected to lead
the construction recovery - is only a very small part of the company's
business. The group also appears under-capitalised for a turnover of more
than Pounds 300m. Property sales still have to be concluded to reduce debt.
Interest charges, however, should be lower this time next year. The group
has left itself sufficient leeway, over the timing of when it takes
construction profits, to enable it to return to the black this year.
Profits, however, should be not much more than Pounds 1m to Pounds 2m and
there are better recovery stocks elsewhere.

FT  14 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Electron House up 58% to Pounds 2.25m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Steady growth in all market areas enabled Electron House, the electronic
components distributor, to record a 58 per cent increase in profits to
Pounds 2.25m pre-tax for the year to end-May.
The figure was bolstered by a drop in interest charges to Pounds 1.18m
(Pounds 2.47m) reflecting lower borrowings following the disposal of the
computer wholesaling business in August 1992.
The disposal had the effect of reducing year-end gearing on a pro forma
basis from 33 per cent to 23 per cent.
Group turnover declined from Pounds 125.4m to Pounds 89m. However, sales
from continuing operations showed an improvement of Pounds 15.9m at Pounds
78.4m.
Earnings improved to 4.92p (2.62p) per share and a proposed final dividend
of 1.55p makes a 2.6p (2.35p) total.
Mr Robert Leigh, chairman, said early indications were encouraging with
strong sales and order intake in the first weeks of the current year.

FT  14 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Snack Factory takes ruthless line with
deviants
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONLY 40 miles from Bensons Crisps lies one of its main competitors, which is
already exploiting state-of-the art production techniques. The Snack
Factory, part of the privately-held Anan Hayle Saeed Group, claims to be the
most efficient snack producer in Europe, writes Catherine Milton.
'The management team had all worked in crisps and snacks before, and we
strongly believed we could do things more efficiently, given facilities
designed with modern technology rather than bolting new machines on to old,'
said Mr Geoff Marsden, Snack Factory's managing director.
Based in Skelmersdale, Lancashire, the factory flanks the M58 motorway. It
cost Pounds 21m and started operating in 1990. It is generating pre-tax
profits of about Pounds 2m on annual turnover of Pounds 28m, all from sales
to supermarkets.
In 11 minutes it can turn muddy potatoes into crisps with computers
enforcing tight specifications at every step.
Not every crisp makes it through the computer checks and tests. The raw
materials themselves may be rejected if tests show that more than 2.5 per
cent of a load is mud rather than vegetable.
Once in the factory the potatoes are automatically washed in recycled water,
cut, and passed through a 'Sizer Halver' to standardise crisp dimensions.
Starch is recovered from effluent and sold on to other users.
The larger of two cookers can handle 2,500kg of potatoes an hour, responding
to temperature and load requirements which change between customer
preference and season.
A US-made computer-controlled high speed video optical sorter scrutinises
every crisp, 'recognises' deviants and then 'orders' them blown off the
production line.
Moisture and oil content are continually monitored by scanners to prevent
soggy-crisp syndrome. Even flavour is checked automatically by a machine
which gives instant salt readings to indicate flavour levels.
The crisps are conveyed around the factory on a specially gentle vibrating
auto-feed system to prevent fractures.
Surviving crisps are fed into Japanese-made Ishida weighing machines, which
drop the proper weight of crisps into tubes of plastic packaging. These are
then sealed and severed to form the packets of crisps.
Mr Marsden said: 'Starting from scratch you have the opportunity to develop
your own culture because you are not bringing working practices from other
organisations.'

FT  14 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Maiden profit at ML Labs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOAN GRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ML LABORATORIES, the USM-quoted research and development company which has
the dialysis drug Icodextrin as its main product, turned in pre-tax profits
of Pounds 65,000 for the six months to March 31.
The outcome, the company's first profit since its shares were placed at 70p
on the Third Market in 1987, compared with a deficit of Pounds 447,000.
Turnover was up at Pounds 467,000 (Pounds 312,000) and earnings per share
came out at 0.1p against losses of 1.8p.
At the year-end the company had Pounds 14.8m on deposit.
Following the announcement that it had won a marketing licence for
Icodextrin in January, the shares - which moved to the USM in December 1990
 -jumped to their present level of about Pounds 11, giving a market
capitalisation of more than Pounds 300m.
Icodextrin is a drug which can be used in chemical dialysis so that kidney
patients do not have to rely on hospital visits to use kidney machines but
can change bags of fluid in their own abdomen themselves, at home or at
work.
The estimated market for Icodextrin - which makes it possible for patients
to go for longer in between fluid changes and has fewer side effects than
other drugs - is, according to Mr Stuart Sim, finance director,
'conservatively estimated at Pounds 487m a year.'

FT  14 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Jacques Vert back in black
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JACQUES VERT turned losses of Pounds 4.65m into pre-tax profits of Pounds
1.03m in the year to April 24, as the women's fashion wear group reverted to
its core activities.
Mr Malcolm Heald, finance director, said that margins had 'crept up on
continuing operations', but that the turnround was due to elimination of
loss-makers.
The board took the decision to restructure at the end of the last financial
year: since then Alain Cannelle has been closed, the 51 per cent stake in
L'Anglaise sold and JV's part of the Ben de Lisi joint venture sold to Mr de
Lisi.
Mr Heald said that the group was now able to trade profitably even if the
economic climate did not improve, but it might have to look for more cuts if
there was a third dip to the recession.
Cash flow and retained profit allowed borrowings to be reduced to Pounds
3.11m (Pounds 6.11m) at the period-end. Gearing fell from 79 to 37 per cent.
Turnover emerged at Pounds 39.3m (Pounds 40.9m restated) and operating
profits were Pounds 1.7m (losses Pounds 1.32m). Interest payable was down at
Pounds 499,000 (Pounds 866,000).
Some 85 per cent of the group's output goes to wholesale with the balance
being sold through JV's own retail outlets. At the end of April, it had 23
stand-alone stores, three down on last time, and having added 41 over the
year, there were 46 concessions within other stores.
Mr Heald said that as a result of the mark-down policy, JV was now 'very
clean' on stock - it was down at Pounds 4.6m (Pounds 5m), the lowest since
April 1989.
Earnings were 8.8p per share, against losses of 40.66p last time. A final
dividend of 2p is proposed for a total of 3p, against the 2p interim last
time when the final was passed.

FT  14 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Cray Electronics pushes up profits to
Pounds 29m - Objectives achieved as acquisition of Dowty IT business gives
the group international status
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CRAY Electronics Holdings, the Berkshire-based data communications and
software systems group which acquired the Dowty information technology
division from TI for Pounds 50m in August last year, yesterday reported
sharply higher profits for the year ended April 30 1993.
Swollen by the Dowty acquisition, profits on disposals and foreign exchange
as well as margin improvements and organic growth, pre-tax profits jumped
from Pounds 2.35m to Pounds 29m.
Earnings per share were 13.8p (1.9p) and the recommended final dividend is
increased to 1p (0.5p) making a total of 1.5p (0.5p).
As expected the results will trigger the final tranche of a three-part
share-option based incentive bonus package, worth in total about Pounds 27m.
The package will be shared by former chairman Sir Peter Michael, his
successor Mr Roger Holland, Mr Jeff Harrison, finance director, and Mr Jon
Richards, managing director, each of whom invested Pounds 750,000 in the
stock at 50p a share when they took over in 1989.
Mr Holland, who succeeded Sir Peter last month, said: 'Our objectives of
improving profit margins, increasing exports and consolidation in the growth
sectors of information technology have been achieved.'
Turnover increased to Pounds 200.8m (Pounds 84.8m) including a 40 per cent
increase in turnover from continuing operations to Pounds 90.4m (Pounds
64.6m) and Pounds 97m attributable to Dowty.
Continuing operations generated Pounds 11m (Pounds 3.22m) of operating
profits in addition to the Pounds 7.2m of profits attributable to the
acquisition and Pounds 322,000 (Pounds 2.14m) from discontinued operations.
After paying Pounds 871,000 (Pounds 2.61m) in interest charges the company
reported 'normal trading profits' of Pounds 17.6m, slightly higher than most
forecasts. An additional Pounds 3.43m in realised foreign exchange profits
made total profits on ordinary activities of Pounds 21m (Pounds 2.74m).
Pre-tax profits were further boosted by exceptional profits on disposals
which with a Pounds 12.6m gain on the sale of Malvern Instruments partly
offset by a Pounds 4.55m loss on other items.
At the divisional level, Cray Communications, which now incorporates most of
the Dowty business, emerged as the largest and most profitable division
within the company with profits of Pounds 12.7m on turnover of Pounds 127m
representing almost 70 per cent of the total. The Dowty data communications
companies accounted for Pounds 7.2m of the profits and Pounds 97m of the
divisional turnover.
COMMENT
The acquisition of the Dowty IT business has transformed Cray Electronics
into an international force in the fast growing market for data
communications equipment. The business has been quickly integrated but there
is still room to push up margins in the combined communications division.
The balance sheet is solid with Pounds 12m in net cash at the year end and
pre-tax profits should reach Pounds 25.5m this year producing earnings of
8.7p per share. The shares slipped 6 1/2 p yesterday to close at 156p and
therefore trade on a lofty prospective p/e of 17.9.

FT  14 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Pressure builds on Spring Ram chief
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESSURE IS mounting on Mr Bill Rooney, chairman and chief executive of
Spring Ram, the bathrooms and kitchens group which has seen its share price
plunge after three profits warnings within eight months.
Institutions led by the Prudential Corporation, Spring Ram's biggest
shareholder, are now believed to have the support of 35 per cent of the
shareholders for their demand that Mr Rooney resign from the company which
he co-founded.
Mr Rooney will be under intense pressure to stand down at a board meeting of
Spring Ram today. He has said he would be prepared to give up the role of
chairman or chief executive, but not both positions.
Company sources have suggested that other executive directors would not be
prepared to work with an imposed chairman.
However, institutional investors believe that they would fall in line with
the wishes of shareholders, in spite of their loyalty to Mr Rooney.
A key role is likely to be played at today's meeting by Mr Roy Barber,
Spring Ram's only non-executive director. A specialist in reviving
financially troubled companies, Mr Barber was appointed in April following
the first bout of pressure from the Prudential.
Mr Rooney and his family trusts own 16 per cent of the group's shares. Other
large stakeholders are Baillie Gifford with 6.8 per cent and Schroders with
3.5 per cent.

COLORVISION, the retailer of televisions, video recorders and camcorders,
lifted pre-tax profits to Pounds 1.78m for the year ended March 31.
That compared with Pounds 84,000 for the previous 12 months which was struck

Turnover rose from Pounds 59.3m to Pounds 64.6m.
Having changed the year-end date the accounts showed turnover of Pounds
88.5m and profits of Pounds 2.03m for the 18 month period ended March 31
1992.
In line with the forecast made in January, directors are recommending a
final distribution of 3.1p (2.5p) to make a 5.6p total.
The total was unchanged compared with the previous 12 months but was against
8.1p for the 18 month period.

<TEXT>
Shares in Court Cavendish, the UK nursing home operator, ended the first day
of trading at 207p compared with an issue price of 225p.
The company's flotation is the first in a recent spate of nursing home
listings to disappoint the market. The offer was more than twice
oversubscribed and applications were scaled down.
One analyst said last week's announcement of a Pounds 33.3m placing and open
offer by rival operator CrestaCare had weakened demand for the stock.

FT  14 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Takeover Panel chief expresses fears over
European Directive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR DAVID CALCUTT, chairman of the Takeover Panel, fears that the European
Takeover Directive could mean the UK losing the advantages of a flexible and
speedy response during takeovers and lead to tactical litigation during
bids.
Sir David used his chairman's statement in the Panel's annual report to
attack the directive, which requires a statutory body to regulate takeovers
and mergers. The directive has been under discussion since 1987.
The Panel is a non-statutory body. It claims to 'avoid over-rigid rules' and
'the risk of takeovers becoming delayed by litigation of a tactical nature,
which may frustrate the ability of shareholders to decide the outcome of an
offer'.
If the directive came into effect, said Sir David, 'the tried and tested
attributes of the Panel - the facility of advance consultation, flexibility
of approach, speed of response and a decision on which practitioners can
rely - may be lost or rendered less potent'.
The annual report showed a sharp drop in the Panel's income, from Pounds
6.38m to Pounds 4.73m, largely because of a fall in contract note levy
income from Pounds 4.1m to Pounds 3.29m and a drop in document fees from
Pounds 2.26m to Pounds 1.4m.
Even so income exceeded expenditure, which fell by Pounds 60,000 to Pounds
4m, and with interest receivable of Pounds 85,000 (Pounds 63,000) the
Panel's surplus after tax was Pounds 748,000, down from Pounds 2.32m. At the
year end the Panel had cash of Pounds 1.68m (Pounds 889,000).
Mrs Frances Heaton, the director general, said the Panel 'has decided not to
make any changes to the basis or level of its charges'.

FT  14 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Low demand pushes Wyko into the red
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WYKO, the distributor and manufacturer of bearings and power transmission
components, ended what it called 'the most unrewarding and difficult year in
the group's history' with a pre-tax loss of Pounds 20,000.
That compared with profits of Pounds 1.38m for the previous year to April
30. Losses per share were 0.5p, against earnings of 2.37p; a final dividend
of 0.5p brings the total to 1p (2.8p).
Wyko's downturn in fortunes has come late in the business cycle. It is now
in the middle of a retrenchment programme of a type which has become
familiar in Midlands industry. Last year the payroll was cut from 1,060 to
962; there will be a further fall this year.
Both the distribution and manufacturing divisions contended with low demand,
severe pressure on margins and an erratic pattern of trade which made - and
still makes - business planning difficult.
Turnover was slightly higher at Pounds 57.4m, against Pounds 55.5m,
reflecting a full contribution from EW Bearings, the distribution business,
but disguising the disappearance of Pounds 5.13m of business on the disposal
of Wyko Power Plant Gears in April 1992.

FT  14 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Increased investment helps Savills to
Pounds 1.4m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN INCREASE of one third in property investment by institutions and
cost-cutting helped Savills, the surveyor and estate agent, return pre-tax
profits of Pounds 1.44m for the 12 months to April 30, against losses of
Pounds 2.86m last time.
A final dividend of 1p is proposed; directors omitted the interim having
made no payment in the year to April 1992.
Earnings per share were 2.2p compared with losses of 6.5p.
Group turnover rose to Pounds 25.3m (Pounds 23.7m). Mr George Inge,
chairman, said: 'Generally, the mood is improved on a year ago although
economic uncertainty continues to dampen market confidence.'
The commercial consultancy division, which includes investing for
institutions, improved turnover to Pounds 10.7m (Pounds 9.68m) reporting
operating profits of Pounds 819,000 (Pounds 1.25m losses).
Mr Inge said: 'Our investment activity was up by about a third. Consultancy
work on behalf of banks and other lending institutions continued to prosper
during the year.'
Turnover from the agricultural and residential business was virtually flat
at Pounds 14.5m (Pounds 14m) with operating profits of Pounds 458,000
against losses of Pounds 1.66m.
Net interest received was Pounds 162,000 (Pounds 48,000). The group finished
the year with Pounds 5m (Pounds 1.95m) cash and no borrowings.

FT  14 JUL 93 / International Company News: Bank of Ireland sells stake in
Greencore
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BANK of Ireland, one of the Republic's two leading clearing banks, has
sold its stake in Greencore only months after the Irish government had
difficulty in placing its holding.
Greencore's stockbrokers, Natwest Securities and NCB stockbrokers, sold the
bank's 9.6m shares in the sugar, milling and malting group at 300p apiece,
making it a IPounds 2.4m (Pounds 2.25m) profit.
The bank acquired the shares in May when Davy Stockbrokers had difficulty in
placing the government's 30.4 per cent stake in Greencore.
It rescued the sale of the government's holding by stepping in and buying
the 11.6 per cent holding at 275p a share. Davy is a subsidiary of the bank.
Mr Kevin O'Sullivan, Greencore's finance director, said: 'This shows there
is no problem with the company or in placing its shares. Any problems in the
past must have been with the government or its brokers.'
The Irish Stock Exchange responded by launching an investigation into the
placing of the government's holding which has been completed but has yet to
be published.
The bank was originally forced to sell the shares because another of its
subsidiaries, the Investment Bank of Ireland, held 15 per cent of Greencore
 -the maximum allowed under the company's articles of association.

FT  14 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Great Portland to review management agent
fees
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GREAT PORTLAND Estates, the UK's sixth largest property group, is to review
a long-standing arrangement by which it pays management fees to a company
fully owned by Mr Richard Peskin, the group's chairman and chief executive,
writes Andrew Bolger.
In the year to March, the property company paid fees of Pounds 2.9m to the
management agent, Basil &amp; Howard Samuel, which acts solely for Great
Portland.
Mr Peskin told shareholders at the annual meeting that fees paid were
significantly lower than those provided for by their contract and more than
Pounds 6m had been saved for shareholders since 1986.
In the light of the Cadbury Report the board had decided to review the
existing arrangements at its next meeting.

FT  14 JUL 93 / BA goes on offensive in Virgin row
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR COLIN MARSHALL, chairman of British Airways, yesterday denied prior
knowledge of the 'dirty tricks' his airline played on Virgin Atlantic
Airways, which led to an apology and a Pounds 610,000 payment to Virgin in
January.
He attacked Virgin's continued pursuit of legal action in courts in London
and with the European Community in Brussels and renewed his call for
arbitration in the long-running dispute between the two carriers.
Sir Colin's account of the Virgin affair was the central plank in his first
speech to BA's annual meeting as chairman. 'I did not direct, authorise or
implement any improper activities or conduct against Virgin or its chairman.
I did not know about them at the time they occurred,' he told the 1,000-plus
shareholders.
He conceded: 'There had been a few unconnected incidents of conduct by a few
British Airways' employees so as to give Virgin cause for concern. Some
employees did obtain some information which related mainly to the number of
passengers travelling on Virgin flights.'
Sir Colin said: 'We do not believe that what was done caused significant
damage to Virgin or brought significant benefit to BA.' He argued that
Virgin's continued claims consisted only of vague accusations.
The new chairman admitted that the Virgin affair and a strike last month by
some employees had hurt morale, but that this was now being rebuilt.
Sir Colin's intense and strident delivery contrasted with the laconic and
sometimes brusque style of his predecessor Lord King at previous meetings.
Lord King refrained from commenting on the Virgin affair which had hastened
his retirement and sat silently in the front row of yesterday's meeting. He
received praise from the platform for his contribution to the company then
rose to acknowledge loud shareholder applause.
Sir Colin's defence of BA came shortly after Mr Brian Basham, its former
public relations consultant, arrived for the meeting saying that Sir Colin
should resign.
'He must take responsibility for the actions of his staff,' said Mr Basham,
who was sacked as a freelance consultant by BA when the Virgin row broke.
Virgin last night rejected Sir Colin Marshall's arbitration proposal. 'We
agreed to an arbitration on another dispute in 1990. It is yet to go through
four years later,' said the airline.

FT  14 JUL 93 / Banks wake up to the big deal in small sums: Rivalry in
cross-border payments
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the market for European cross-border payments - as with so many matters
involving banks - it never rains but it pours. After years of hardly
reacting to moans over the long delays and high charges that accompany such
payments, banks are now falling over each other to improve things.
The disclosure this week that Visa International is to set up a transfer
system using its data network to allow small payments within six days is one
element of a competitive ferment. At least two consortia of European banks
and several telecommunications groups are working on projects.
Given the development of the European single market - and European
Commission pressure for greater transparency, lower charges and more
reliable service - banks might be expected to compete strongly for such
business. There are two reasons why they have not until now.
One is that the market is still small. Most of the 200m small cross-border
payments each year are made by individuals. Only 10 per cent of UK companies
made payments abroad in 1991, and one in 13 received them.
Second, banks already have a cross-border payments mechanism. The Swift
network, founded in Brussels in 1977, is a closed and secure service used by
3,000 financial institutions in 90 countries. It allows cash and securities
transfers in standard formats.
But the status quo seems increasingly unattractive for a variety of reasons:
Small businesses in Europe are keen to make quick and cheap cash transfers
as they trade more across borders. The Swift system was designed for large
transfers and does not impose strict conditions in terms of pricing or speed
of transfer. This can mean variation and delays.
Transfers made through Swift rely on a chain of bank links. The cash is
transferred from the originating company's bank through the Swift network to
its correspondent bank in the country involved. That bank then registers the
payment with the bank of the company receiving it.
Small payments can be delayed and cost a lot. An EC study last year found
that transfers averaged six days and took up to 30, costing an average of 14
per cent of the sum transferred.
Swift was established as the banks' data network. But other networks run by
companies such as IBM, General Electric and British Telecom offer access to
financial services companies. This means prices are falling for transfers
over popular routes in Europe.
European banks are increasingly seeking ways to co-operate across borders
without buying expensive branch networks from other banks. The offer of
cross-border services through the networks of other banks is one means of
attracting domestic fee-based business from companies with trade links.
The Ibos system, run by Royal Bank of Scotland, Banco Santander, Credit
Commercial de France and Banco de Comercio e Industria in Portugal, has been
aimed primarily at individuals, but will be relaunched this autumn with new
services for small companies.
Rather than using a correspondent banking network, Ibos is confined to the
member banks in each country. Those banks can make transfers, through
British Telecom's Timenet data network, among their accounts across borders
and can be cleared within seven seconds.
Royal Bank charges Pounds 6 for a Pounds 3,000 transfer through Ibos,
compared with Pounds 15 through Swift. Mr Norman McCluskie, Royal Bank's
managing director of operations, says the Ibos banks 'see ourselves in a
very dramatic position' because of the potential for attracting new
business.
The bank believes Ibos will help persuading corporate customers to open
accounts. The Ibos system requires access to accounts at the banks that
participate. This means that as long as Ibos sticks to allowing one bank per
country to take part, it may gain a competitive advantage.
However, this also limits the potential business for Ibos. At the moment,
Royal Bank and Banco Santander only account for 0.7 per cent of cross-border
payments between Britain and Spain. The system carried 5,000 transactions
last month, but can carry 40,000 per day.
The issue of whether to continue limiting access to Ibos is pressing because
other banks are considering establishing their own closed networks. National
Westminster Bank, Commerzbank in Germany and Societe Generale in France have
said they are working on a possible initiative.
The participating banks in Ibos are meeting in Madrid this Friday to
consider opening the network to others. They are also mulling over
approaches from US banks to participate in the network, possibly on the
basis of a single bank operating the service in each state.
Swift is also thinking of ways to respond. The network has cut prices on the
most-used transfer routes and is considering bulk transfer of small amounts.
Mr Eric Chilton, Swift's chairman, thinks it would be wrong to allow other
carriers to dominate the retail market while Swift concentrated on high
value transfers. He says easier transfer of small sums will attract treasury
operations of large companies.
'If we make transfer easier, then a lot of people who hold assets in
different countries now might be keen to avoid it and run Treasury
operations from the centre,' he says. The implication is that the emergence
of competition for small cross-border payments has only just started.

FT  14 JUL 93 / Takeovers sink to a 25-year low
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MERGER activity last year fell to its lowest level in the Takeover Panel's
25-year history.
The panel's annual report, published yesterday, said that in the year to
March 31 there were 88 takeover or merger proposals, down from 142 the
previous year.
The highest number in one year was 436 in 1971-72. The annual average is
225. The fall in the number of takeovers had enabled staff cuts to be made,
said Mrs Frances Heaton, the panel's director-general.
The panel regulates takeovers of publicly owned companies through the
application of the Takeover Code. It is also consulted on cases which do not
lead to published offers. The number of such cases rose from 116 in 1991-92
to 141 in 1992-93, suggesting that companies were more likely to back away
from proposed deals.
Several financial restructurings of troubled companies have been carried
out, leading to the panel adjudicating on a larger number of 'whitewashes' -
where shareholders taking more than 30 per cent of a company's equity and
acting in concert are exempted from making a full bid for the company.
These have arisen mainly where groups of banks have agreed to convert a
company's debt into equity, and as a result have more than 30 per cent of
the company's shares. Mrs Heaton said the panel had tried to treat these
conversions 'as pragmatically as possible'.
She also referred to the panel's statement last August on 'off the record'
comments made during takeover bids by a company or its advisers. This came
after TI Group's successful bid for Dowty Group in June. The Panel censured
two Dowty advisers, one for giving a profit forecast to analysts which could
not be substantiated under the Code. Mrs Heaton said: 'This subject remains
of great concern to the panel.'
She added that if speculation arose in the stock market or the press during
a bid, the panel might require the appropriate company to make a statement
either substantiating, or disassociating itself from, the speculation to
prevent a false market developing.

FT  14 JUL 93 / Italian telecoms merger planned
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
IRI, Italy's biggest state holding company, yesterday revealed plans to
rationalise the telecommunications sector, starting with the merger of Sip
and Italcable by the end of this year.
Sip is Italy's main telecoms utility, while Italcable handles
intercontinental traffic. Both companies are quoted.
The union will be the first step towards grouping Italy's public sector
telecoms activities, split between seven main companies, into a single
concern. The new organisation, expected to be called Telecom Italia, should
be operational by 1995-96.
IRI's new management, facing a cash crisis, has identified telecoms,
controlled by the Stet holding company, as an obvious privatisation
candidate.
Stet is issuing a L565bn Eurolira bond, convertible into Sip savings shares,
in a further step towards privatisation. The deal could cut Stet's stake in
Sip savings shares from 32 to 18 per cent.
The government has set IRI a June 30 deadline to prepare rationalisation
plans. IRI intends to start by merging the main providers of services, while
keeping manufacturing and mobile telecoms apart.
Telecom Italia will absorb Telespazio and Sirm, Stet's satellite and
maritime communications subsidiaries. Telecom Italia will also comprise
Iritel, formerly known as ASST, the unit responsible for domestic trunk
communications and short-distance international calls.
The future of Stet's equipment manufacturing (Italtel) and network service
(Sirti) businesses is less clear. Stet has been looking for foreign
investors in Italtel, in which AT&amp;T has a 20 per cent stake.
The highly profitable mobile telecoms business, run by Sip, will be hived
off into a separate company, in which Telecom Italia will retain a minority
stake. Italy's government hopes to float about 20 per cent of the IMI
financial services group and 30-35 per cent of the Ina state insurance
company this year.

FT  14 JUL 93 / Go-ahead for BAe's Taiwan deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DENNIS ENGBARTH and DANIEL GREEN

<DATELINE>
   TAIPEI, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TAIWAN'S economics ministry and local banks yesterday gave a conditional
go-ahead to provide Dollars 460m (Pounds 309m) in low-interest loans for
joint venture between British Aerospace and Taiwan Aerospace Corporation
(TAC).
The proposal to transfer production of BAe's regional jet (RJ) airliners to
the Pounds 250m joint venture is fundamental to the restructuring and
recovery of BAe's loss-making civil aircraft business.
BAe said the main condition made by Taiwan's government - a commitment to
the joint development of new aircraft models - was already the subject of
talks between the two parties.
The loans are needed to finance the production and leasing of the RJ
aircraft, to be assembled in Britain and Taiwan.
Mr Yang Shih-chien, deputy minister of economic affairs, said the bank group
now 'has a grip on the risk factors'. It is 'willing in principle to
co-ordinate with government policy' which is strongly in favour of the
venture.
Mr Yang said the banks agreed in principle to offer TAC a minimum package of
Dollars 460m, including Dollars 400m to help finance the launch of the
leasing operation for the RJ jet and Dollars 60m in working capital.
But the banks want BAe to provide firm commitments on several issues before
granting final approval.
The 'focal point' was a commitment by BAe to develop jointly with TAC an
advanced regional passenger jet (or RJ-X). The ministry and the banking
group had agreed that 'development of the RJ-X is an indispensable part of
the entire plan', Mr Yang said.
He also wanted to know more about possible launch aid from the UK and
further details of the arrangements for leasing the aircraft.
The bank consortium, led by the state-owned Chiaotung Bank, has questioned
the sales and leasing potential of the RJ and the feasibility of the
venture's plans to lease the aircraft.
TAC, 29 per cent owned by the Taiwan government, and BAe agreed in January
to form the 50:50 joint venture to produce a new family of passenger
aircraft to cash in on the fast-growing but competitive Asian markets.

FT  14 JUL 93 / Water clean-up will add Pounds 54 to bills, warns regulator
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR IAN BYATT, the water regulator, yesterday warned the government that it
risked large increases in household water bills unless it delayed the
timetable for cleaning up the UK's water supply.
If all obligations to improve quality were met, the typical household water
bill in England and Wales could rise Pounds 54 a year in the five years from
1995, and a further Pounds 23 in the five years after that, Mr Byatt warned.
This would amount to an annual rise of 5 per cent in real terms.
In a report to ministers, 'Paying for quality: the political perspective',
he said Britain's water quality obligations were confronting the industry
with enormous costs which would have to be passed on to the consumer.
'I do not believe that customers would want to see their water bills rising
at this rate,' he said. 'Domestic customers have already suffered a squeeze
in their incomes. Business customers competing in difficult markets may be
hard-hit by large increases in water bills and the cost of treating trade
effluent.'
Mr Byatt singled out European Community regulations for placing 'an
unmanageable burden' on customers. The cost of implementing the urban waste
water directive had soared from an estimate of Pounds 2bn to Pounds 10bn, he
said, and the government should consider going to Brussels to negotiate a
five-year extension. He believed the UK was not alone in its concerns about
EC standards.
Other regulations which could be reviewed include those on drinking water,
sewage disposal, run-off of fertilisers, dumping of sludge at sea and the
clean-up of bathing beaches. Mr Byatt said it was 'not a matter of going
back to the Dark Ages, but of how far and how fast we proceed'.
The report was welcomed by consumer groups such as the Ofwat National
Customer Council and industry but attacked by environmentalists for seeking
to postpone the clean-up.
Mr Chris Smith, Labour's environment spokesman, called it misdirected:
'Where pollution cannot be prevented, it should be the polluter, not the
water consumer, who pays to remove it.'
Mr Tim Yeo, minister at the environment department, said the government
would gauge public reaction and try to respond by early autumn. He said the
report 'shows there is an inextricable link between higher standards and
prices'.
The report forms part of a campaign by Mr Byatt to hold down costs in the
water industry, and to deal with public concern about water bills. It is
addressed to Mr John Gummer, the environment secretary, and Mr John Redwood,
the Welsh secretary.
The report updates a preliminary paper issued last year by Mr Byatt in which
he laid out the cost of cleaning up Britain's water, which has suffered from
decades of underinvestment.

FT  14 JUL 93 / Private charges by NHS consultants 'a monopoly'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE WAY some National Health Service consultants charge for private practice
forms a complex monopoly under the Fair Trading Act, according to the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
The commission says that last year 9,500 NHS consultants set fees at or
close to British Medical Association guidelines or the scales of Bupa and
PPP, two leading private medical insurers.
This finding is given in a letter to doctors setting out the provisional
results of an investigation into private medical services.
The commission says it thinks the action of consultants in 'following what
are in effect tariffs' restricts competition, but emphasises that it has not
reached final conclusions 'nor made any judgment as to whether the effects
of the conduct are good or bad'.
NHS consultants working part-time provide the bulk of medical manpower for
private hospitals. The commission began investigating the way they set their
fees last September.
In its letter, the commission says it has identified a number of respects in
which the behaviour of the BMA, Bupa, PPP or consultants might be considered
to be against the public interest.
These included questions as to whether publication of guidance had led to
higher fees and whether it had reduced or eliminated regional variations in
charges. The commission sets out possible remedies that might apply if it
decides the action is against the public interest.
These include prohibiting consultants from following published guidance and
banning insurers from reimbursing claims according to tariffs of procedures.
The remedies also raise the possibility of opening up private medical
services to a wider range of doctors.
BMA officials argue that provision of information on fees is a public
benefit, and say the commission's inquiry has shown that consultants' fees
rose more slowly than most other hospital charges between 1986 and last
year.

FT  14 JUL 93 / Major backs ending of Sunday trading curbs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY and RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR yesterday backed the ending of restrictions on Sunday trading,
amid warnings that the government's planned legislation on shop opening
hours could be wrecked unless it provided extra protection for shopworkers.
The Downing Street statement that the prime minister would vote for total
deregulation came as the Home Office unveiled four options for reforming the
widely-flouted Sunday trading laws in England and Wales.
MPs will have a free vote in the new session of parliament in the autumn on
which option will form the basis of legislation.
The four options are:
Total deregulation, allowing all shops to open at any time.
Partial deregulation, based on proposals from the Shopping Hours Reform
Council, allowing smaller shops to open at any time, but larger shops to
open only six hours.
Limited opening, based on proposals from the Keep Sunday Special Campaign.
Most shops would shut but small shops and certain categories of large shop,
including DIY and garden centres, could open.
Limited opening, based on proposals from Retailers for Shops Act Reform,
similar to those of the KSSC but allowing all shops to open on the four
Sundays before Christmas.
Mr Michael Howard, home secretary, who also favours deregulation, said he
was confident parliament would back one of the options.
The government annoyed Labour MPs and campaign groups whose proposals formed
the basis of the bill by failing to extend protection against being forced
to work on Sundays to future as well as existing shopworkers. Mrs Joan
Ruddock, Labour's home affairs spokeswoman, said the threat was 'hanging
over the government' that MPs might ultimately vote the bill down, even if
one of the options received a majority.
Mr Michael Schluter, director of KSSC, said the government had broken its
promise to give a 'full and fair representation' of each campaign group's
proposals by excluding KSSC's demand for full employee protection and double
pay for Sunday working. He said his group could not support any reform of
the law without worker protection.
Baroness Jay, chairman of SHRC, said she hoped the government's stance on
employee protection would not 'jeopardise the reform process'.

FT  14 JUL 93 / High-fliers push aside corporate old guard
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCY KELLAWAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TRADITIONAL British boss, famed for being poorly educated, elderly and
insular, is being pushed aside by a younger generation of better-qualified
managers.
A survey of British company boards by Korn/Ferry, the firm of international
headhunters, says a 'transformation' is taking place in the education of
British managers.
The survey, taken from The Times 1,000 companies, shows almost 80 per cent
of top executives at companies with a turnover of over Pounds 250m are under
55, and 40 per cent are under 50.
Fewer younger managers had been promoted from within, compared with older
ones, and almost half had been in their jobs for less than five years.
Of younger directors, 27 per cent could speak at least one language in
addition to English, compared with only 15 per cent of directors between 50
and 55. Two-thirds of those under 50 had degrees, compared with less than
half the older group. Of the top executives of companies with turnover above
Pounds 1bn, 13 per cent have a master of business administration
qualification, more than twice as many as last year.
Mr George Bain, president of London Business School, said: 'People have
always said that the British manager lacks quality as he doesn't have the
same training as his competitors and is insular. These figures begin to
suggest that that is changing.'
Mr Michael Brandon, the report's author, said pressure exerted by the
recession had helped to promote younger managers, and explosive growth in
MBAs and management consultancies had made management more attractive to
young people.
He argued the change was part of a general move towards a better-educated
society and resulted from the expansion in university education since the
1960s.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Two clouds darken the Takeover Panel's horizon. The panel worries that the
proposed EC takeover directive will result in a statutory body superseding
its informal role. Such a change would indeed be a shame if it lessened the
flexibility of the UK's takeover regime. But the directive's shape is
unclear. Besides, it will take some time to wend its way through Brussels'
corridors. A more immediate concern is simply the dearth of takeovers, at a
25-year low in 1992. The panel is already shedding staff. It may yet end up
having to cut its fees.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Colin Marshall must have breathed a large sigh of relief yesterday as he
successfully anticipated and defused criticisms of BA's management at its
annual meeting. Small shareholders were more inclined to discuss the merits
of Cornwall, the imperfections of Concorde and the beastliness of
transporting furry animals by air than unravelling the mysteries of the
Virgin affair. Large institutions have never been much interested in the
matter. BA therefore looks as though it has survived the storm. The
appointment of more non-executive directors, including the no-nonsense chief
executive of Inchcape, Mr Charles Mackay, helps reassure.
But there are still unanswered questions. Publicly, Virgin says it is
determined to pursue its legal case. That may result in BA directors
appearing in court, throwing up more bad publicity. Moreover, Virgin has
opened another front by complaining that BA has breached EC anti-trust
rules. Shareholders may dismiss these issues as rather tiresome but they are
unlikely to go away. The Pounds 22m general provision BA continues to carry
against litigation suggests it regards such tussles as a permanent feature
of the airline business.

FT  14 JUL 93 / The Lex Column: UK economy
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Since the government's own statisticians were at pains to stress that May's
industrial production figures were distorted by public holidays, not even
the enthusiasts for recovery can take them at face value. Still, the trend
in manufacturing output confirms the strength of recovery. Even the slowing
in pace recently is overshadowed by the overall improvement, and economic
growth may approach 2 per cent in 1993. It seems the inflationary impact of
devaluation has been effectively muted because the UK economy is running so
far behind its potential and deflationary forces are still strong worldwide.
What stops the champagne corks popping is anxiety over the current account
deficit. If the increase in investment is helping increase exports, the UK
may be in for some genuine non-inflationary growth. If it stokes domestic
demand, the recovery will not have too far to run. Either way, there is a
case for some tax increases in the autumn budget to control the rate of
expansion. A simultaneous interest rate cut might also blunt sterling's
appreciation on the foreign exchanges. One other nagging worry is the way in
which economic statistics seem to be running ahead of companies'
expectations. But perhaps the September reporting season will provide more
cheer.

FT  14 JUL 93 / The Lex Column: Roche
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Roche is a rare example of a pharmaceuticals company which has successfully
reinvented itself. Having lived through dark days during the decline of
Valium, the tranquilliser on which its fortunes rested until the early
1980s, Roche's prodigious investment in research and development is now
bearing fruit. The 14 per cent sales increase in pharmaceuticals during the
first half stands in contrast to modest expectations elsewhere in the
sector. Holding drug sales steady in Germany despite the havoc caused by
healthcare reforms is especially impressive.
Like other drugs companies, Roche may still be vulnerable to nasty shocks. A
successful patent challenge to its diagnostics technology, or disappointment
for Genentech's new products, would cloud the earnings outlook. With strong
positions in biotechnology, over-the-counter medicines and prescription
pharmaceuticals, Roche has spread its risks second time around.
Strange, then, that it should remain shy about the fine details of its
financial performance. Investors will have to wait until the year end for an
indication of first half profits. Still, as long as the company is turning
in annual earnings growth of around 20 per cent, even the most principled
investor will be inclined to forgive. If the stratospheric growth rate
starts to falter, Roche may have to be more forthcoming to retain support.

FT  14 JUL 93 / The Lex Column: Mr Byatt's water torture
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Yesterday's missive from Ofwat on the cost of water quality sheds little
light on the direction of next year's regulatory review. True, the 7 per
cent real return on capital for water companies assumed in Ofwat's sums
would be encouraging if carried through to the review. But Mr Ian Byatt, the
regulator, may not be as generous in practice. By recommending that the
government postpones the implementation of some water standards, he is
trying to pass the problem of rapidly rising water charges back to the
politicians. As he also believes that standards are too tight, the
assumption in his report of a generous rate of return - and hence larger
price rises - suits his purpose well.
Whether Mr Byatt can squeeze a decision from government on standards, and
thus capital expenditure for water companies, before the review is also open
to doubt. Without a political decision, Ofwat might feel obliged to assume
tough standards and high capital expenditure in setting price limits for the
second half of the decade. That could result in a cautious settlement,
broadly favourable for shareholders. The more likely outcome, though, is
that price limits will be altered as spending obligations become clear. A
stable framework of medium-term regulation looks a distant prospect.
Even if the government comes down in favour of less onerous standards and
lower capital expenditure, there is no guarantee water companies will be
less geared or less likely to make rights issues. That turns on the return
on capital which Mr Byatt finally settles on in his review.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
As usual, the annual report of merchant bank NM Rothschild raises about as
many questions as it answers. One teaser is why the remuneration of the
bank's chairman, Sir Evelyn de Rothschild, should fall from Pounds 852,000
to Pounds 542,000, when disclosed profits rose to a record Pounds 14.5m,
well over double the previous year's Pounds 6m?
The answer, according to a nervous Rothschild retainer, is that around half
of that was not profit in the commonly accepted sense. Rothschild's Guernsey
offshoot sold its stake in an investment trust and the gross proceeds - not
just the capital gain - were included. Also, for some obscure reason, Sir
Evelyn had received an exceptionally large bonus the previous year.
Meanwhile, the report explains how the bank complies with the Cadbury
recommendations 'to the extent that these are appropriate to a private
company'. But of course.

How times change. Spotted in the Savoy Grill after yesterday's British
Airways annual meeting were Sir Tim Bell, Lady Thatcher's favourite spin
doctor and BA's new image-maker, BA's ex-chairman Lord King, and Brian
Basham, who used to be Lord King's favourite public relations man but is now
dishing the dirt on his old client.
A couple of years ago they could have been sharing the same table. Yesterday
they hardly seemed to be on speaking terms.

The race to take over the presidency of the European Bank for Reconstruction
and Development is turning out to be more complicated than first thought.
Leaving aside Observer's suggestion yesterday that the wife of Jacques de
Larosiere, governor of the Bank of France, may prefer her jet-setting
husband to stay closer to home, it is gradually dawning upon other EC
governments that de Larosiere's candidacy may in fact be an elaborate bluff.
EC officials in Brussels say France's real aim is to secure the top job at
the European Monetary Institute, the precursor of the independent European
Central Bank, which under the Maastricht treaty will oversee a single
European currency.
Thus the de Larosiere candidacy serves a dual purpose: to preserve France's
original claim to the EBRD seat which, if denied, would give Paris far
greater leverage in determining the EMI appointment. France desperately
wants the top job at the EMI because it would signal that the German
stranglehold on European monetary policy exerted by the Bundesbank was at
last being broken. It would also be a consolation prize in the light of the
expected location of the putative European Central Bank in Germany, either
in Bonn or Frankfurt.
It is all gossip at the moment but it perhaps explains the behaviour at
Monday's Ecofin meeting where only the Germans showed much enthusiasm for
the candidacy of de Larosiere. The Belgians and Italians, who had been
expected to support him, were surprisingly mute.
Meanwhile, Lord Lawson is emerging as a wild card candidate for the EBRD
post. Britain's ex-chancellor of the exchequer is widely believed to covet
the job - but regards it as infra dig to apply. Know the feeling.

Tough luck for Manchester that Olympic supremo Juan Antonio Samaranch should
arrive in town the morning after the coldest July night since 1946. Even
worse that it soon started raining. However, Manchester has learnt how to
turn bad news into good in its long campaign to win the games in 2000. It
didn't take long for a local worthy to note that since the International
Olympic Committee is really interested in seeing new world records,
yesterday's weather was ideal for any athlete, other than a sprinter,
contemplating a record-breaking run.

announced yesterday that it would give free public transport passes for two

The bad news is that Wartburg owners get three years' free travel if they

Wise old birds attending agms have all sorts of tips on what to look for
apart from a copy of the chairman's speech. Did the great man smile, was his
finance director wearing a colourful tie, or, heaven forbid, a beard? Little
things count when checking a company's health.
However, one of Observer's favourite ploys is to check out the grub. Take
Aegis, the media-buying company. At its agm in May 1990 it served up
champagne and canapes, before serving up bumper pre-tax profits for the
following year. Its 1991 agm saw a diminished but none the less inviting
spread of fancy biscuits, followed by mildly disappointing profits. But by
1992 only the plainer Rich Tea were on offer and sure enough it was a
horrible year for Aegis - boardroom mayhem, collapsing share price, and a
pre-tax loss of Pounds 1.9m.
What then are we to make of yesterday's agm, with its ginger and
marzipan-coated Battenberg cakes? Probably no more than that the company is
going through a sticky patch.

FT  14 JUL 93 / Leading Article: The value of clean water
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
PURER DRINKING water, cleaner rivers and less polluted beaches have clear
attractions. But what is the price of delivering them?
Too high, according to Mr Ian Byatt, director-general of Ofwat, the economic
regulator of Britain's water industry. Meeting European Community
environmental commitments agreed by the government since the industry was
privatised in 1989 will lead to an extra Pounds 1.5bn a year in capital
investment over the next five years, on top of the Pounds 3.5bn currently
being spent. Additional commitments under discussion could increase the cost
by a further Pounds 1bn a year.
For the average customer, the full programme would mean an extra Pounds 54 a
year on bills between 1995 and the end of the century. Customers would not
be prepared to put up with such increases, thinks Mr Byatt. The government
should therefore renegotiate EC directives on sewage treatment and drinking
water quality.
Mr Byatt's argument has been challenged by the National Rivers Authority,
the industry's environmental regulator. It says Britain's water charges are
low by comparison with the rest of Europe, bills would not need to rise by
as much as Ofwat suggests because of the scope for efficiency improvements
and customers would be willing to pay for better standards.
It is difficult to know for certain how much customers would be prepared to
pay for higher quality in an industry where they have no opportunity to shop
around. But the bulk of the evidence suggests that too much attention has
been paid to standards and not enough to costs. Customer surveys show that
in most parts of the country there is limited willingness to pay much more
for additional improvements. Moreover, a raft of complaints to Ofwat and
politicians about the cost of current bills suggests there would be stiff
resistance to higher charges.
Nor is there much evidence that better standards would improve public
health. Mr Byatt argues that the new sewage measures would mean that a town
with a population of 10,000 produced the pollution equivalent to 27 pigs,
while the drinking water provisions would result in pollution equivalent to
one aspirin in an Olympic-size swimming pool.
Pointing out that these are EC standards to which Britain is already
commited, as the NRA does, is not a sufficient counter-argument. The huge
sums involved mean this is a sufficiently important issue for EC governments
to re-think the regulations. Moreover, given the current stress on
subsidiarity, this surely is an example of regulation which should be dealt
with at the national level.
Mr Byatt yesterday asked the government to make its mind up whether it wants
higher standards or higher prices. This puts ministers in a tight corner. If
standards are relaxed, they will be lambasted by the green lobby; if they
are maintained, customers may complain. Ofwat has made an impressive case.
It demands a political response.

FT  14 JUL 93 / Leading Article: Sunday trading
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PRIME MINISTER and the home secretary yesterday strongly backed complete
deregulation of Sunday trading in England and Wales. Their backing came as
the government published details of the four options it will place before
parliament for replacing the current discredited restrictions. This strategy
could, however, leave the law in chaos or impose equally anomalous
restrictions on Sunday trading.
The idea of letting MPs choose between a range of options on an issue which
has divided the Conservative party in the past is attractive to a government
with a small majority. However, there is a danger that presenting several
options could result in the adoption of none if the most popular of the four
cannot command a parliamentary majority. That would leave the law in its
current unsatisfactory state, widely broken by large retailers and not
enforced by local authorities which see the popularity of Sunday shopping.
Barely more acceptable would be a victory for partial deregulation. Two of
the three options allowing limited Sunday trading include a list of goods
which could legitimately be sold. Such a list would inevitably replicate the
anomalies which have thrown the present law into disrepute by permitting the
sale of pornography on the sabbath but not the sale of bibles. Why, after
all, should it be permissible to buy fertiliser at a garden centre on a
Sunday, but not groceries at a supermarket?
All three partial deregulation options involve restrictions on the opening
of larger shops. This would limit choice to the smaller, less efficient
retailers whose prices are often higher. One worthwhile consequence of
deregulating Sunday trading would be the opportunity to make more efficient
use of capital. To exclude the larger stores from unrestricted Sunday
opening would therefore impede this desirable outcome.
Complete deregulation has been an unqualified success in Scotland. And
reprehensible though law-breaking is, the de facto deregulation of Sunday
trading south of the border has been hugely popular with customers. The
government must thus strain every sinew to ensure that this option
eventually commands a majority.
One way to achieve this would be to strengthen the legal protection for
shopworkers who do not wish to work on Sundays. Seven-day working is common
in other industries, and it would be invidious to give shopworkers special
rights for work on Sundays. But there may be scope for concessions - perhaps
time-limited - which could win support from opposition MPs without losing
the benefits of deregulation.
Alternatively, local authorities could be allowed to hold referenda on
Sunday trading. Parts of the country with strong sabbatarian traditions
could retain restrictions, while more secular areas broke free from them. A
measure of local democracy could yet be the way to break the parliamentary
log-jam.

FT  14 JUL 93 / Personal View: Why World Bank needs an ombudsman
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL D BRADLOW
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The need for an effective World Bank has never been greater, and confidence
in its operating procedures has never been lower. The international
community expects the World Bank to help Russia and the other former eastern
bloc countries create functioning market economies; help South Africa
transform its apartheid economy; and continue helping borrower countries
alleviate poverty, and improve the efficiency and sustainability of their
economies and the efficacy of their governance.
Recent developments suggest that the bank cannot meet these demands unless
it undergoes structural reform. An internal study found that the bank is
plagued by a 'pervasive preoccupation with new lending' that can distort
loan appraisals. Both staff and borrowers view loan appraisal as a
promotional exercise aimed at the directors who must approve all loans.
Loan administration is also deficient. The study found borrower compliance
with the financial covenants in loan agreements to be 'startlingly low'. The
bank's failure to enforce these covenants suggests both parties view them as
'suggestions', not binding commitments.
The bank's experience with the gigantic Sardar Sarovar dam project in India
provides a graphic illustration of the consequences of these problems. The
bank-appointed independent review panel found that the bank's failure to
follow its own operating rules contributed to the problems associated with
the dam's human and environmental impact. The bank's management is aware of
these problems, and the board has just begun reviewing proposals for
improving the supervision of the bank's operations.
One proposal the directors should be encouraged to adopt is to appoint an
ombudsman. Such an ombudsman should have a mandate to:
Investigate all 'qualifying' complaints about the bank's implementation of
its own operating rules and procedures. A qualifying complaint is one made
about ongoing bank operations by any person directly affected by bank
activities. The complaint must be accompanied by some supporting evidence.
Respond to the complainant and, if appropriate, make non-binding
recommendations to the board within a reasonable period after receiving the
complaint.
Publish a publicly available annual report discussing the complaints
received, the investigations conducted, and the final dispositions of the
complaints.
The ombudsman, who would be appointed by and report directly to the
executive directors, would be independent of the bank staff; should not be
drawn from the bank staff; and would be granted a fixed-term, non-renewable
appointment and control of his/her own budget. The ombudsman would have the
authority to initiate investigations, compel bank staff to produce
documents, submit to investigations and participate in public hearings.
An ombudsman's function is to monitor the administration of public
institutions and prevent administrative injustice. A World Bank ombudsman
would:
provide the board with independent and timely appraisal of claimed
deficiencies in ongoing bank operations;
provide directors with independent information on the staff's compliance
with the bank's operating rules and procedures. The board can use this
information both to design appropriate rules and procedures and to identify
the 'best practice' for their implementation;
create an impartial, independent and competent authority that assures both
bank and public that all complaints about bank operations will receive a
fair hearing and helps educate the public about the bank's operating rules
and procedures;
de-politicise disputes concerning bank operations by providing a complaints
procedure that is based on rules that assure fair access for all qualifying
complainants; and that ensures that fact-finding and decision-making is
carried out by a disinterested body. Decisions must also be based on the
merits of the complaint rather than on the complainant's ability to exert
political pressure on the bank;
protect the bank's executive directors and staff from having to deal with
complaints lacking merit;
provide the board and, through its annual reports, the international
community with empirical information, that is presently unavailable, on the
developmental and human impact of bank operations.
In short, an independent World Bank ombudsman whose findings are public
would significantly enhance public confidence in the bank's ability to
perform its responsibilities and the credibility of the advice it gives to
its member countries. It would also set a precedent for other international
organisations entrusted with the management of public resources.

FT  14 JUL 93 / A shine on its financial face: Domestic and foreign
pressures are forcing reform on Germany's capital markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
German bankers are normally a self-confident breed. Lately, however, they
have started to worry, loudly and publicly, about the need to speed up
necessary reforms in the country's financial markets. The mood is all the
more sombre because it comes in the middle of a deep recession.
Summing up the anxieties, Mr Rolf Breuer, chairman of the German Stock
Exchange and a board director at Deutsche Bank, said recently: 'The German
capital market still has an international credibility problem.'
Mr Gerhard Eberstadt, board director in charge of securities at Dresdner
Bank, adds: 'If Finanzplatz Deutschland - Germany as a financial centre -
wants to improve its international acceptance, it must observe international
standards.'
The mood of soul-searching has been touched off by several developments.
First, companies need to find capital abroad as the government soaks up the
bulk of domestic savings to finance the costs of reunification. This is
exemplified by the recent decision of Daimler-Benz, Germany's largest
industrial group, to become the first German company to seek a full listing
on the New York Stock Exchange.
'Germany is much less of a financial island than it was 10 years ago, much
more dependent on foreigners,' said Mr Herbert Jacobi, chief executive of
Trinkaus &amp; Burkhardt, a Dusseldorf bank principally owned by Midland Bank of
the UK.
Second, banks recognise the need for changes in the regulatory environment
to face up to foreign competition. Unless Germany can match the regulatory
infrastructure of the US and the UK, Frankfurt will find itself at a
disadvantage in the global competition for capital. German financial
institutions will also lose business to other centres - and the
manufacturing companies which are their prime clients could suffer as a
result.
Mr Joseph Lufkin, managing director of Global Proxy Services, a company
which advises US institutional investors, said: 'Anglo-American money has a
whole set of different strings attached to it. Recognising this, the German
financial and industrial establishment is taking deliberate steps to improve
its international image.'
Third, the scandal over share transactions by Mr Franz Steinkuhler, the
former head of the IG Metall trade union, focused international attention on
German delays in drawing up laws to combat insider dealing. On Monday, after
sustained criticism of apparent foot-dragging in outlawing insider trading,
the finance ministry finally published a draft law to criminalise the
practice and to introduce other long-awaited reforms.
Mr Wolfram Freudenburg, head of the Stuttgart branch of Deutsche Bank, said
of the Steinkuhler affair: 'In the interests of both the company
(Daimler-Benz) and Germany as a financial centre we simply cannot put up
with this sort of thing.'
Of the three factors acting as a catalyst for reform, the need to attract
outside capital to meet the costs of reunification is most significant.
After years of registering large current account surpluses, united Germany
is now registering a moderate deficit. Whereas Germany in 1990 exported
DM66bn of long-term capital, last year it imported a net DM47bn of long-term
funds from abroad.
With Germany's public sector borrowing requirement likely to stay high for
several years, the implications for corporate and financial Germany are
clear. 'Whenever they look for capital, German companies will face strong
competition from the state,' said Mr Thomas Mayer, senior economist at the
Frankfurt office of investment bank Goldman Sachs. 'This will drive up the
cost of borrowing money and force companies to look abroad for capital.'
One important development is that companies are stepping up their marketing
efforts to attract foreign investors. They are more willing to provide the
kind of 'investor relations' services common in the US and the UK - such as
'roadshows', where senior managers visit investors and promote the benefits
of owning their shares.
Ms Corinna Arnold, senior analyst at Investor Responsibility Research
Centre, a US organisation which advises American institutions on corporate
governance issues, said: 'There is a greater understanding of what US
investors and analysts are trying to do. German companies are helpful in
providing information now.'
The importance of the international investment community is underlined by
foreigners' large stakes in big companies: nearly 40 per cent at Siemens,
the electronics group, more than 40 per cent at Deutsche Bank, nearly a
third at Veba, the energy-based conglomerate, just under 40 per cent at
Commerzbank, and over 20 per cent at BASF, the chemicals company.
While companies are improving investor relations in general, Germany's
biggest company is taking a more radical step. In seeking a full New York
listing, Daimler-Benz is submitting to American-style regulation for the
first time.
For decades German companies have refused to comply with the listing
requirements set by the Securities and Exchange Commission - the regulatory
body for the US securities industry. The reason was their reluctance to
disclose financial information in line with US rules.
As part of its attempt to meet US investors' requirements for openness in
business dealings, and to show that it was ready to play by international
rules, Daimler announced in early April it would wind up Mercedes Holding
(MAH), a holding company which owns a 25 per cent stake in Daimler, because
it served no purpose other than to block takeover bids. Daimler intends to
convert MAH shares into ordinary Daimler shares for two reasons: first, the
shareholding structure means MAH would interfere with plans for a
DM2bn-DM3bn Daimler rights issue next year; and second, because of the
perception that US investors would find the anti-takeover device an affront
to their notions of fair play.
MAH was propelled into the limelight when Mr Steinkuhler of IG Metall, a
former member of the Daimler-Benz supervisory board, bought nearly DM1m
worth of shares in the company, most of them just before it was revealed
that MAH would be dissolved. The announcement led to a substantial rise in
MAH's share price, leading to the suspicion that Mr Steinkuhler had made his
investment on the basis of insider information.
Mr Steinkuhler denied this, but resigned anyway, in the face of criticism
from Germany's financial es-tablishment as well as international investors.
Mr Tom Homes, head of research at Schroder Munchmeyer Hengst, a bank
majority-owned by Lloyds Bank of the UK, said: 'The suspicion alone that he
was insider dealing degrades the quality of Germany's financial markets.'
While the Steinkuhler affair heightened awareness that the rules needed to
be changed, his dealings also served 'to revive foreigners' perceptions that
the German market is an insiders' market', said Mr David Hale, chief
economist at Chicago-based Kemper Financial Services Group.
Deutsche Bank and other large German institutions are striving to allay this
perception by bringing their internal compliance regimes up to international
standards. The emphasis has been on stopping practices such as
'front-running' - whereby traders would buy shares on their account before
buying shares for clients. This would be classified as a form of insider
dealing in the UK or the US.
Foreign investors nevertheless remain concerned about an 'insider culture'
within German capitalism: foreigners will always be at an 'information
disadvantage' compared with German banks and insurance companies. Domestic
institutions still own the bulk of shares in quoted German companies and
have access to detailed information about companies' performance via their
seats on German supervisory boards. One consequence of Daimler-Benz's New
York listing is that foreign investors will receive more details about the
group's financial performance.
Change will be slow. But the inevitability of Germany's increasing capital
needs over the next decade will mean further change is ineluctable. 'If you
want equity capital,' said Mr Barthold von Ribbentrop, former head of
securities sales and trading at Deutsche Bank, 'the biggest suppliers are
English and American pension funds. If you want this equity, you have to
adjust to their way of thinking. You have to swallow your pride and present
yourself differently.'

FT  14 JUL 93 / Leading Article: Saving Somalia
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
AT THE heart of Somalia's deepening crisis is the fact that the United
Nations, and in particular the US, have not faced up to the implications of
their military intervention. The humanitarian imperative that prompted it
remains compelling, for Somalia manifestly cannot save itself. To withdraw
now would be to compound a tragedy: it would mean abandoning a country in
terminal distress while undermining the credibility of UN interventions
elsewhere. But for the UN to continue in its present role, neither
peacekeeper nor peacemaker, also invites disaster.
The sequence of events that led to the murder of four journalists by the
Mogadishu mobs shows how serious the crisis has become. It began when UN
forces attacked what was said to be a command centre of General Mohamed
Farah Aideed, the fugitive warlord whose militia have killed 35 UN soldiers
over the past month. The UN said the raid had been successful, and that 16
people had died. Aideed's Somali National Alliance claimed that 74 died, and
that victims included elders of Aideed's clan. In the fury that followed,
mobs turned on reporters once praised for bringing Somalia's plight to the
attention of the world.
Similarly, the warmth with which US marines were greeted last December has
turned to a resentment so deep that many aid agencies which welcomed the UN
as a protector now see association with the troops as positively dangerous.
Key military partners, notably Italy, are questioning the merits of the
exercise.
One tragedy begets another. The UN force is in danger of getting caught up
in the very chain of retaliation and revenge that fuels the bitter clan
rivalry which has destroyed Somalia. Military intervention that sought
primarily to provide security for food convoys appears to have become an end
in itself; but the UN operation was never going to be enough in a country
shattered by civil war.
Intervention should have included at the outset a comprehensive programme to
disarm rival factions, using all the necessary force and offering the
combatants the eventual choice of integration into a national army, or
training in civilian skills. There should have been a long-term programme of
economic reconstruction and constitutional negotiations drawing on the
widest range of Somali leaders.
A new initiative by the UN is now desperately needed. This should involve,
at the very least, greater clarity on the part of the Security Council as to
its objectives in Somalia. It may entail taking full responsibility for
Somalia as a UN trusteeship. This would be a costly and unprecedented
undertaking. But it is the only way of providing a legal basis and political
framework for an effective UN role. The alternative - abnegating
responsibility - would be a dishonourable course. But even that would be
better than the shambles that prevails today.

FT  14 JUL 93 / No bite without teeth: Europe needs its own troops and the
will to commit them
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD MORTIMER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Last week I gave you the worm's eye view of Europe, from the Balkans. Now
look at the continent (or subcontinent) from the other end of the telescope:
the privileged centre, looking out. This week I was invited to a cosy little
get-together in Paris, organised by the Konrad Adenauer Stiftung, one of
those well-endowed 'foundations' associated with German political parties
(in this case Chancellor Helmut Kohl's own CDU.)
Only six countries were represented: the Big Three of the European Community
(Germany, France, the UK) and the Hopeful Three of central Europe (Czech
Republic, Hungary, Poland) - the latter being countries which have made a
convincing transition to democracy, are well on the way to becoming market
economies, and are directly contiguous either to the existing EC or (in the
case of Hungary) to the EC as it should be after Austria joins in about
1995.
We were there to talk about 'integrating the states of central and eastern
Europe into western structures'. But the structures discussed were mainly
those concerned with security, rather than the EC as such. The keynote
speaker was Karl Lamers, the CDU/Christian Social Union spokesman on such
matters, who proposed that the 'Visegrad countries' (the Hopeful Three plus
Slovakia) should be admitted to the Western European Union, as a step on the
way to full membership of both the EC and Nato.
Everyone appreciated Mr Lamers's good intentions, but this specific proposal
did not arouse much enthusiasm. WEU is prized by some for its strength and
seriousness on paper, but despised by others for its weakness and frivolity
on the ground.
At present it has only 10 full members, all of whom also belong to both the
EC and the Atlantic alliance, and are bound by treaty to come to each
other's assistance if attacked - a stronger commitment than that which binds
Nato members, whose treaty leaves each member to decide for itself how to
respond if one of the others is attacked. At Maastricht, WEU was formally
designated as both the 'European pillar' of the alliance and the 'defence
component' of the future European Union.
All of which makes it quite a serious affair: not so much a step on the way
to either body as an inner sanctum where both overlap. But when it comes to
military hardware and organisation, WEU is at best a pale shadow of Nato.
Its main area of practical activity in the last year or so has been the
enforcement of sanctions on Yugoslavia, and it has done little to make the
operations more effective. If anything, it has got in Nato's way, by
duplicating the chains of command through which forces belonging to the same
group of countries are controlled.
Both Nato and WEU have sought to involve central and east European countries
in their activities, realising that if they did not contribute to the
integration of those countries with the west they would appear completely
irrelevant to Europe's post-cold war security problems. But neither has yet
been able to satisfy the main demands of those countries, which are for full
integration and security guarantees.
Nato has set up NACC (pronounced Nack-Cee), the North Atlantic Co-operation
Council, which has done some useful work but is devalued in the eyes of
central Europeans by the fact that it includes a lot of remote ex-Soviet
republics, in whose security Nato clearly has at most a marginal interest.
(Some are already up to their necks in warfare.) WEU has avoided that
mistake, confining its attentions to countries it sees as eventual
candidates for EC membership: the Visegrad four plus Bulgaria, Romania and
the three Baltic states. But short of full membership, with the explicit
security guarantee that that would bring, it has little of practical value
to offer.
Central Europeans have looked carefully at western security structures. They
have no doubt that for the foreseeable future Nato is the one worth dealing
with, and if possible belonging to. 'Consequently,' said a Czech speaker in
Paris this week, 'we do not agree with some west European countries which
try to seek in WEU an alternative to the Atlantic alliance.'
That dig was aimed not at Mr Lamers, who genuinely sees WEU as binding the
EC and Nato closer together, but at the French - who, even while claiming to
want a continued US presence in Europe, constantly warn that it is not to be
counted on, and stress WEU's link to the EC while playing down its link to
Nato.
Yet within the west that argument has cooled down a lot in the last year.
France, of course, remains outside Nato's integrated military command. But
the Germans did succeed in brokering an agreement on the circumstances in
which the Franco-German 'Eurocorps' would be available for Nato service, and
neither in London nor in Washington is it any longer seen as a dire threat
to the alliance.
At the same time the US's firm refusal, despite European pleas, to put
troops on the ground in Bosnia to back the Vance-Owen plan has given some
substance to the French argument. Clearly there are contingencies where
Europe will need a capacity to do something military, but where the US,
without being strongly opposed, will not feel its own interests sufficiently
engaged to be willing to commit troops.
Enter, presumably, WEU. But brandishing those three magic letters will not
help unless Europe itself has the troops needed and is willing to commit
them. And that will not be the case unless Germany can overcome its
political and constitutional inhibitions about deploying troops in a
peace-enforcement role.
Mr Lamers, the ball is in your court.

FT  14 JUL 93 / Letter: An adequate retirement income for all
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr FRANK FIELD MP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your editorial ('Private pensions', July 13) suggests one solution to
the cost of funding state pensions is to let them 'gradually wither on the
vine'. That is what is happening. By the middle of the next century, the
value of the state retirement pension will have shrunk to a mere 8 per cent
of average earnings.
It is this dark fact, combined with a current Pounds 35bn bill for providing
inadequate pensions, which was the starting point for the Fabian pamphlet
entitled Private Pensions for All, which Matthew Owen and I wrote and
submitted as evidence to Labour's Social Justice Commission.
Our proposals do not envisage - as you have reported - the scrapping of the
state pension. The aim is to gain a mix of public and private pensions so
that everyone gains two pensions and thereby an adequate retirement income.
Our assumption here is that there is a limit to what individuals want to pay
in tax. The proposals therefore combine tax, compulsory contributions from
employers and employees, while leaving open the opportunity for people to
make additional voluntary contributions.
The reform package envisages:
A substantial increase in today's pension financed by the scrapping of the
tax concession on lump sum payments.
The compulsory inclusion of all workers, including part-timers, in company
or private pension schemes.
The focus of taxpayers' money to finance the contributions of the
unemployed, disabled and carers who are prevented from working.
While everyone will continue to receive their state pension a clawback will
operate on those with substantial private pensions.
Each and every one of us will have a right to own our own pension fund
assets.
We hope the Social Justice Commission will poll voters on what they think of
this plan. While any new idea is open to misinterpretation, Labour's aim
must be to have an agenda to which the government is forced to react, and
which voters will enthusiastically endorse at the next election.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From E F GROVE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The article on royalty by John Lloyd ('Superstar route for royalty',
July 10) is in need of correction.
He states that all of the palaces 'including the so-called private
possessions like Balmoral and Sandringham' should be opened up to the
public.
He obviously has not visited these two residences or he would have
discovered that both are accessible to the public. At Sandringham he could
not only see the house but also the extensive country park, the stunning
gardens and grounds and the museums (including a motor museum).
At both places he could have enjoyed a cup of tea and a meal. He could have
bought granny a souvenir and at Sandringham the children could have tried
the adventure playground.
What more does he want?

FT  14 JUL 93 / Good try, but could do better: Can Tecs shift their strategy
from skills training to economic regeneration?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The chief executive of the Training and Enterprise Council looked pensive as
she listened to a succession of government ministers last week spelling out
what they expected Tecs to deliver.
It was a long list: what part, for example, could Tecs play in improving
educational standards? How should they transform the skills of the
workforce, or help companies to improve their competitiveness?
'We have only existed for three years and we are getting better all the
time,' said Mrs Olivia Grant, chief executive of Tyneside Tec. 'It is not
that we are not eager and willing to do more - but it is a hell of a task
they are asking of us.'
The event was the third annual conference, in Birmingham, of the 82 Tecs in
England and Wales. It was attended by more than a thousand Tec directors and
a drove of ministers. Mr John Major, the prime minister, then in Tokyo, sent
a video message.
Tecs were set up in 1991 as the government's main response to mounting
anxiety about the UK's industrial competitiveness and the inadequate skills
of its workforce. They represent the government's most radical experiment in
public-private partnership. Funding for the Tecs, whose boards are dominated
by senior business executives, will be Pounds 2.3bn this year.
Their brief at inception was to run government programmes for the unemployed
more efficiently (any efficiency savings can be used to re-invest in local
projects), and to become involved in their local economies. They would
assess and address local skills needs and set priorities for economic
development with other agencies such as local authorities. The idea was to
help bolster the wider economy by tackling skills and enterprise issues at
local level.
That was the mission. Government league tables, to be released next week,
will show that a growing number of Tecs are having a small, but significant
impact on what have long been seen as deep structural problems in the
British education and training systems. The tables will show that Tecs -
albeit with widely differing performances - are getting better at placing
young people in training schemes, where they are gaining better
qualifications than in the past; they are equipping more unemployed adults
with vocational qualifications; and they are encouraging more companies to
train workers to match their business requirements.
But there have been frustrations for the Tecs. The government, their main
customer, concerned at rising unemployment, has forced them to concentrate
most of their efforts on improving the two main training programmes for
young people and the adult unemployed. This meant they were unable to tackle
effectively the broader part of the brief - promoting enterprise.
But last week at the Tec conference the government reaffirmed its original
mandate to Tecs - much to their delight. Mr David Hunt, the new employment
secretary, made it explicit that he wanted them to live up to all of their
name.
'I want the enterprise objectives of Tecs to come to the fore,' said Mr
Hunt, who has told his civil servants that the employment department is an
economic - as distinct from a social welfare - department.
The Tecs should do this by building on what they had already achieved in
local enterprise projects and skills training.
For the past 18 months or so there has been a mounting campaign among the
1,000-odd Tecs directors about their enterprise role - that part of the
brief that persuaded business leaders such as Sir Alistair Morton, chairman
of Eurotunnel, to join Tec boards.
Their argument is simple: it is no good concentrating on training unemployed
people for jobs when there are so few jobs to go round. Thus the balance of
the Tecs' work should logically shift from training to enterprise: this
would embrace initiatives from promoting inward investment to setting up
soft loans for companies.
The Tecs are aware this part of task will be tough.
'Enterprise is a difficult word,' said Mr Edward Roberts, chairman of G10,
the group of Tec chairmen which represents common Tec concerns to the
government.
'It means lots of different things, from supporting businesses small and
large, to the whole of economic regeneration. Tecs must also be part of and
party to setting local economic strategies.'
Mr Michael Hanson, chief executive of South Thames Tec, said: 'If you took
everything that was said at the conference by both the government and Tecs
you would think we were the salvation of the nation.'
The government must help, said Mr Hanson, by first putting its own house in
order. Government departments had to have clear and co-ordinated objectives
and relationships with Tecs. Further, Tecs want greater clarity about the
way they fit in with other government schemes, such as the new Urban
Regeneration Agency, set up to try to improve the use of derelict land.
Mr Hanson said: 'We are important but we can only be one of a number of
contributors to a larger effort. There are no magic buttons. But the
government must play an active part. It could for example help us persuade
our prospective partners that being involved with us is worthwhile.'
There is further support for the importance of the government's
co-ordinating role in a study by Mr Bob Bennett, senior lecturer in
geography at the London School of Economics, to be published this autumn.
Mr Bennett points to the Tecs' new 'one-stop shops' as one of their most
successful business advice projects. The brainchild of Mr Michael Heseltine,
the secretary of state for trade and industry, these pull together under one
roof a wide spectrum of business aid agencies, including Tecs, chambers of
commerce and local enterprise agencies.
However, Mr Bennett says the Tecs' record of promoting enterprise and
economic development is patchy. A big problem, according to Mr Bennett - a
strong advocate of Tecs merging with chambers of commerce - is the
government's current weighting of Tec budgets towards train-ing.
Tecs made clear to Mr Hunt last week they wanted the balance of funding to
be reviewed, and they presented him with a list of demands to promote
enterprise, including tax relief for companies pursuing best training
practice, and more flexibility in their own budgets to plug skills gaps and
encourage local employment.
Funding is critical to their progress, but Tecs are showing they are able to
work as effective local catalysts. They have the remit to bring
organisations together, and to identify areas where they can best make a
contribution. Examples of Tecs working along these lines include:
Lincolnshire Tec, which is working in partnership with its county and
district councils on inward investment. They have jointly set up a
free-phone service for inquiries from potential investors. The Tec can also
offer investors training tailored to their needs. Northumberland Tec
identified a need for low-cost loans to local business. It helped set up new
venture capital arrangements with local banks.
Leeds Tec identified a need for more cost-effective training among local
printing companies. The Tec brought together a group of companies and
contributed to the cost of training equipment to be used jointly. Such
collaboration is rare among competing companies. Mr Hunt believes that is
'just the sort of catalysts Tecs can be'.
But does it add up to a strategy?
Mr Richard Guy, chief executive of South and East Cheshire Tec, said: 'Each
Tec has a different local plan but generally they are around the broad
themes of helping individual businesses to start up and grow, improve their
skills base and promote inward investment along with other partners.
'That is set down as a local strategy. But, if you added them all together,
that adds up to an industrial strategy.'
But Tecs need the government's help to turn that into a national strategy,
engaging all its departments in a common cause.
As Britain emerges from recession, the urgency and scale of the task still
facing the Tecs and government is underlined by a recent study by the
International Institute of Management Development of the extent to which
education and training in 22 developed countries was meeting the needs of a
competitive economy: the UK ranked 20th.

FT  14 JUL 93 / Letter: Oxleas Wood victory is not an isolated case
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JOHN STEWART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Tim King gave a good account of the campaign that saved Oxleas Wood
('If you protest in the woods today', July 10), but he was wrong to conclude
that it 'looks like an isolated cause'. It is only the latest in a number of
road schemes to be dropped since 1990: the London Road Assessment Studies;
the Exeter northern by-pass; the Hereford by-pass; the Woodstock by-pass.
Contrast this with the 1980s when the Department of Transport rarely
suffered a setback.
Moreover, there is a growing transport and environmental movement which is
calling for a switch of road-building resources to investment in other modes
of transport. The Oxleas Wood victory will have given it added momentum,
placing other roads schemes long cherished by the transport department in
real danger.

Sir, There is a touch of Monty Python in the fact that in this day of
instant electronic money transfer and an alleged 'common market' that Visa
International can make your headlines with 'Visa plans small payments
cross-border service' (July 12) for small companies and individuals. Is not
the cheap, simple transfer of funds around Europe a pre-requisite of a
Single European Market? Why have not our Brussels bureaucrats made this,
rather than standards for false eyelashes, the priority?
I have just tried to pay into Barclays a cheque for Pounds 13.33 drawn on a
French bank. I was told there would be an initial handling charge of Pounds
4, then a Pounds 2 charge for the interest (usury?) while the cheque was
being handled, and a further Pounds 6 for a 'correspondence' charge: a total
of Pounds 12. Net receipts Pounds 1.33. The sooner we have a common currency
the better for all of us, except the banks.

FT  14 JUL 93 / Letter: Full picture on Gatt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DONALD S JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your article on winners and losers in the Uruguay Round of the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade ('World Trade News: Those who stand to win
and lose in thewrangling', July 9) sets out most lucidly the principal
issues, and those suppliers of goods and services who stand to benefit. Any
exposition of the issues at stake in the current negotiations should surely
include an analysis of winners and losers among the purchasers of those
goods and services - that is consumers around the world. Given that in
virtually all cases consumers stand to benefit from progress in the Gatt
talks it was most surprising to see the only mention of consumers under the
heading of Losers (third world consumers unable to afford expensive
pharmaceuticals).
It is the focus on protected producers who stand to lose, and the lack of
emphasis on benefits to consumers, that has enabled politicians to drag
their heels on Gatt talks for the last seven years. While it is not
incumbent upon your journal to lobby actively for or against the Uruguay
Round, it is at the least incumbent upon you to show a fuller picture than
offered by your otherwise most informative article.

Sir, Your editorial on Bosnia ('Strong words, weak action', July 9) ends on
a James Bond type of note by referring to a mystery ship 'that was

It ceased operations 'because of a Serbian complaint to the International

You urge the nations that are enforcing sanctions in the Adriatic to render
all necessary assistance to enable the ship to resume operations.
I can only conclude that the Serbo-Croat programmes of the BBC World Service

FT  14 JUL 93 / Arts: Rain stops play in Avignon - Anthony Curtis finds
Moliere's Don Juan getting more than he bargained for
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY CURTIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Don Juan of Moliere has a career that is identical with that of Mozart's
Don Giovanni, not surprisingly since they both stem from the same original
written by a Spanish monk. In both play and opera the Don has a faithful
servitor who accompanies him on his travels, takes much of the rap for his
misdeeds, and at one point swaps identities with him. But, as emerges from
the new production of Moliere's comedy at Avignon that opened this year's
Festival, there is a world of difference between the mood of the two works.
Through the interrogation of his master, amusingly combined with deference
and flattery, Moliere's Sganarelle forces him to define and redefine his
position in relation to the traditional Christian tenets he has repudiated.
The result is a mixture of black comedy and socratic dialogue that rips
apart the basic assumptions of family life. No wonder the Church saw that
the play should remain unstaged for many years and then allowed it to reach
the stage only in a sanitised version by Thomas Corneille. This was in spite
of the climax, as in Mozart, when the statue of the Commander whom Don Juan
has killed in a duel, comes to dinner - the subtitle is Le Festin de Pierre
(The Stone Feast) - and consigns him to hell.
At the first night in Avignon when the stone Commander nodded his head in
acceptance from his plinth there were magnificent claps of thunder and
flashes of lightning. Full marks, we thought, to Jacques Lassale, the
administrator of the Comedie Francaise who has directed this production. But
no, the storm was for real. Then the unthinkable happened, the heavens
opened and the rain poured down. There is no shelter either for actors or
audience in the Courtyard of the Papal Palace and so at around midnight the
play was abandoned with two acts still to go. I cannot remember rain
stopping play here ever before and I have been covering this Festival for at
least 10 years.
Even so three acts out of five were enough to take the measure of Lassale's
production. The setting could not be more simple or more effective. A
cluster of conifers to the left of the stage and a small stream in front
serve as the decor. Towering above them is the great medieval facade of the
palace alternatively shrouded in darkness or bathed in soft yellow light. It
is a formidable arena for a conflict between good and evil, expressed
through the discrepancy between appearance and reality, underlined by
Lassale in a series of costume changes. The Don enters in the traditional
black doublet and hose of a Spanish nobleman and we observe him being
stripped of this habit by the tubby cynical Sganarelle of Roland Bertin, an
experienced actor who has played many roles here in previous festivals. The
hero is then shaved and re-attired on stage in a colourful costume suitable
for a masquerade. This Don Juan has to contend not only with the ghost of
the Commander but with several historical ones, the ghosts of those great
actors who have played the role in living memory - Jouvet, Vilar, Strehler
among them.
Avignon's new Don Juan, the Polish actor Andrzej Seweryn has been working in
France since 1980. He joined the Comedie Francaise this year and he gives an
exciting interpretation of the exacting role. He has grace, agility,
gentleness; his striking lantern-jawed face provides a fine impassive mask
to match the enormity of his utterances and behaviour. He treats the tirades
as if they were nocturnes by Chopin, delivering them with delicate, subtle
articulation. The same lightness of touch is evident in his bodily contact
with the other characters, notably when he encounters his discarded wife
Elvira. This role of the one-time nun is played by Jeanne Balibar, a young
actress still a pupil of the Conservatoire: a great opportunity which she
seized passionately. Clearly we are going to hear a lot more of her in the
future.
The later scene with the two peasant girls (Catherine Sauval and Cecile
Brune) to both of whom Don Juan has promised marriage was played with a
similar balletic mobility. As Don Juan removed their bonnets and let down
their hair, it seemed only right and proper that they should have rejected
their longstanding rustic boyfriends in order to marry him. Seweryn
elegantly deflects their questions, refusing to commit himself to either by
name. In the end the two women are left embracing each other, the Don having
once more escaped.
Lassale is on record as saying that he views the comedy as 'a kind of road
movie.' Don Juan uncovers new aspects of himself with each encounter. They
are marked by the director's skilful use of the elements - water into which
one of his assailants is thrown, earth on which he sits, fire by the light
of which he unfolds his pragmatic morality to his servant. It will be
interesting to see how Lassale copes with these effects when this
essentially open-air production transfers to the Salle Richelieu in Paris
later this year. At least it will not be rained off there.

FT  14 JUL 93 / Arts: Spoleto - without music - William Weaver is
entertained by Mamet, Williams and Dario Fo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM WEAVER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The spoken theatre - the 'prose' theatre, as Italians call it, even when the
dramas are in verse - has always been a part of Gian Carlo Menotti's
Festival of Two Worlds, though its position has been ambiguous. Some years,
drama occupied a major role, and new plays by Tennessee Williams or by
Italian writers like Giuseppe Patroni Griffi have been presented in
Spoleto's houses. In other years, music and, often, ballet have played the
major roles, while one or two plays were given, dutifully, almost as filler.
This year, Italy's drama critics flocked to Spoleto, where they were offered
the continental premiere of David Mamet's Oleanna, as controversial here as
elsewhere; and a revival of Williams's Streetcar named Desire, in a superior
new translation by Masolino D'Amico and an aggressive, even brutal, but
always coherent staging by Elio De Capitani, with a set by Ferdinando Bruni
that erased all reference to New Orleans, all local colour (indeed, all
colour of any kind). Somehow, this abstraction made some of Williams's
poetic tirades, which seemed outdated almost when they were written, become
more acceptable, a part of the general madness. This grotesque approach,
however, did not rob Mariangela Melato's Blanche of her touching magic.
Aleksandar Cvjetkovic pulled off the amazing feat of looking and dressing
like Brando, yet still giving a strong, individual, original performance.
Critics, in speaking of Dario Fo, tend to call him not an actor but a 'man
of the theatre.' To some extent, this description simply means that, in
addition to performing, he also writes plays and stages them. But there is
more to it than that: Fo is one of those artists who, no matter what he
does, remains himself, Dario Fo, even while he is convincing you that he is
an industrialist or a pope or a clown. So when it was announced that he
would perform two works of the 16th century Paduan dramatist Angelo Beolco,
known as 'Ruzante,' the admirers of Fo and the admirers of this elusive,
rarely-performed late Renaissance master were understandably excited.
In the event, apparently for bureaucratic reasons, the production could not
be realised; instead Fo devised a 'meeting' with Ruzante, which was perhaps
more useful, if less fun. The evening - Fo standing behind a lectern - began
with an almost academic presentation of the figure of Beolco, placing him in
the political and social context that are so important to understanding his
work. But understanding his work is arduous for a more specific and
straightforward reason: he wrote almost entirely in the Paduan dialect of
his time, virtually incomprehensible to today's Italians, even if they come
from Padua. After his professorial introduction, Fo began to read,
practically to perform, first alone, then with the collaboration of his wife
and co-star Franca Rame and two other actors, some passages from Ruzante,
which Fo had translated not into Italian, but into a modern Paduan-Venetian
dialect to some extent of his own invention. For many members of the
audience, this was almost equally strenuous to grasp. Even at the lectern,
Fo indulged in his familiar posturings and grimacings. Finally, one was
certainly convinced of the importance of Ruzante, less convinced perhaps of
Fo as the writer's ideal interpreter. It may be that Ruzante's theatre -
like that of Plautus, his spiritual ancestor - cannot be reproduced in
modern terms. A sad thought, but one that is hard to dismiss.
For some years a regular, highly popular feature at Spoleto has been the
season of the marionettes of the Carlo Colla and sons, a company that has
delighted generations of Milanese children (and adults) for about a century
and a half. Menotti, one of those children, on hearing a few years ago that
the Collas were losing their home, helped rescue the troupe, along with the
incomparable patrimony of original sets, costumes, texts, scores, and - of
course - marionettes, and festival audiences have enjoyed a series of
revivals, including the grand spectacular ballet Excelsior which, with human
actors and dancers, was a triumph at La Scala in the 1880's. This year, in
the now-deconsecrated church of Santa Maria della Piaggia, which has been
made into a theatre for them, the Collas presented a lesser, but charming
piece, Dalla terra alla luna, with a moon-walk (or rather moon-dance, with
wedding, that made NASA look cheap).
Another recent and fascinating intrusion of the spoken word at the festival
is the series of interviews, under the rubric Testimoni del tempo (Witnesses
of our time), conducted by the critic and journalist Elena Doni, who has the
gift of being understated without fawning and informed without showing off.
This year her series of guests included Arthur Schlesinger, who attracted a
capacity crowd to the intimate Sala Frau, a perfect setting. There, relaxed
and urbane, he answered Doni's questions - as well as those of the audience
 -with pointed wit, evident concern, and profound knowledge. For some
Italians, it was a revelation to see this multi-faceted mind at work; and it
was clear why so many leaders, Kennedy at their head, listened to the
speaker with attention.
Nowadays, every event at Spoleto sells out; and on weekends the town is
jammed. And yet, it remains unspoiled. Or rather, it improves, from the
festival-goer's point of view; as a new hotel, like the elegant Palazzo
Dragoni, or a fine new restaurant like the Apollinare, make a stay in the
Umbrian jewel still closer to perfection. Only the audiences are sometimes a
trial. Since Spoleto has become 'in,' the visitors eager only to be seen
and, if possible, to spot some celebrity, shamelessly talk through
performances (one even read his newspaper during a lovely chamber concert),
leave before the end. But this is the price Spoleto pays for its success.

We should not, I suppose, allow the dreadful mateyness of the title of
BBC1's new series, Doc Martin's Casebook to put us off, though when it
becomes clear that the subject of this opening programme is snoring it is
hard to avoid the feeling that we are in for yet another example of tabloid
television. Dr Hughes is a Cambridge GP who has been dishing out advice on
local radio for the past eight years, and Tom Moffatt is the man who has
always snored but who used to work shifts. Now he has been retired, and is
driving his wife and family crazy (7.30).
Golf And All Its Glory is described as both a showcase for golf and a
celebration. Great players talk about the game and archives are used to
investigate the origins of the sport (7.40 BBC2).
There is nothing wrong with good television programmes being repeated;
indeed television should have a repertory element. But BBC2's series of The
Wednesday Play may serve to highlight the paucity in single drama today. The
season begins (9.00) with 'Up The Junction', written by Nell Dunn and
directed by Ken Loach.

FT  14 JUL 93 / Arts: Why success is all a question of pitch - Television
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER DUNKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
While radio is an excellent medium for broadcasting music, television has
always had problems: the sound has to be accompanied by something in the way
of pictures, and most programme makers clearly feel that they should provide
'added value'. This notion has reached its logical extreme in the pop video
where the pictures are often more interesting than the music and, these
days, frequently dominate the experience. On Saturday in Pictures At An
Exhibition: Concerto For Paintbrush And Orchestra BBC2 came up with a sort
of orchestral video. While the orchestra played the Mussorgsky, artist
Norman Perryman painted on glass plates which the camera showed us either
straight on the television screen or projected onto a tall screen behind the
orchestra.
Such ideas are not new. Decades ago a documentary about Picasso's technique
was made by setting up cameras behind glass screens upon which the artist
worked. Moreover the type of image created by Perryman reminded you of the
light shows accompanying rock concerts in the 1960s where oil, water, paint
and dyes were mixed and squeezed, sometimes between small glass plates, and
then projected on giant screens. The effects were particularly pleasing, it
is said, for anyone who happened to be enjoying hallucinogenic substances at
the time. My own memories, admittedly somewhat hazy, suggest that the
effects at a Doors concert at the ICA and at a Time Out concert at - could
it have been? - Alexandra Palace were far more dramatic and gorgeous than
anything we saw on television on Saturday.
In any case the idea of Perryman 'interpreting' the music through paint and
working to the rhythms of the orchestra was irritating. It brought to mind a
passage from Howard's End: 'What is the good of the arts if they're
interchangeable? What is the good of the ear if it tells you the same as the
eye? Helen's one aim is to translate tunes into the language of painting and
pictures into the language of music. It's very ingenious and she says
several pretty things in the process, but what's gained I'd like to know?'
What indeed.
Much more entertaining was Discovering Beethoven, also screened by BBC2,
which consisted of a lecture about the fifth symphony with musical
illustrations followed by a performance of the entire work. The success of
the venture stemmed almost entirely from the personality of Michael Tilson
Thomas who conducted the orchestra and choir (why a choir for the fifth? -
well, he showed us how it might have sounded had the composer given us a
choral section as in the ninth) and delivered the lecture. This was cleverly
pitched so that it neither insulted anyone's intelligence nor demanded such
musical expertise as to put people off. It took us from Gregorian chant to
Beethoven via Monteverdi with remarkable ease and lucidity. Tilson Thomas
has that trick of conveying learning without supercilious didacticism which
was such a winning characteristic for Kenneth Clark and Jacob Bronowski.
Of course in 1993 many broadcasters view that sort of expertise with deep
suspicion. The Reithian notion of aiming programmes slightly above the heads
of your expected audience has been turned upside down: now broadcasters are
competing to see who can aim lowest. Some years ago Granada, then the most
highly regarded commercial television company in the world, launched what
was planned as a major series called Man And Music. Four or five splendid
documentaries were completed, with extensive foreign footage and lots of
expensive archive research. But what has happened to the rest of the series?
Today it is not programme quality which gets Granada's name in the
newspapers but its predatory activities in the stock market.
The magazine Time Out is, of course, the most fashionable and flourishing of
London's 'what's on' magazines. Launched in the 1960s, it has stayed at the
centre of successive social trends and now toes the sort of politically
correct line which avoids publication of sexually stimulating photographs
unless they appeal to homosexuals. This month it ran a feature about female
comedians which neatly encapsulated the received wisdom on this topic: fewer
(or to use their word, less) female than male comedians appear on television
and on the London club circuit because of prejudice against women. 'Almost
anybody, no matter how liberated, reacts differently to a woman trying to be
funny. There's this arms folded 'show us what you can do' type attitude.'
Just as it is repeatedly asserted of television in general that 'you have to
be twice as good to get on if you're a woman' so 'women have to work much
harder to get an audience's trust' and 'it's just not seen as attractive for
women to be funny; people see it as ugly and unladylike . . . The industry
is discriminating and under-serves a rich seam of female talent . . . it's
important to ask why so few females feel able to make it in comedy'. Never
at any stage does anybody even whisper the suggestion that perhaps there
simply are not very many talented female comedians around, yet all the
evidence suggests that this is the only reason for the disparity between the
sexes.
When you think of the dramatic inequality between men and women in other
activities (orchestral composition, philosophy, chess, physics, cartooning)
this scarcely seems surprising. And when you remember the global success
achieved as much as 40 years ago by a woman who did prove her talent -
Lucille Ball - you feel obliged to ask what happened to the prejudice in her
case? There is such pressure in broadcasting these days to discriminate in
favour of women that, far from needing to be twice as good to get a chance,
you only need to be half as good as a comparably inexperienced man. But
while broadcasters may desperately kid themselves that the talent is there
so that a new one-woman series is justified (Emma Thompson, Tracey Ullman
and Josie Lawrence come to mind) they cannot force the public to share their
blinkers. The idea that this is misogynistic prejudice on the part of
viewers rather than the ability to discriminate would be more convincing if
Victoria Wood, French and Saunders, Ruby Wax and Sandi Toksvig had not been
so successful.
Nor can you accuse these successful women of abandoning their sex and buying
acceptance by becoming quasi men (an argument used about leading female
comics in the Victorian music hall). Since giving birth Ruby Wax has
specialised in detailed and discursive, not to say lurid, sequences about
childbirth, and the funniest routine in Victoria Wood: Sold Out on Saturday
was her account of buying a pregnancy testing kit and attempting to use it
in a public lavatory.
To more strait-laced viewers that may sound distasteful, but it is as pure
as the driven snow compared to the material used by somebody such as Jo
Brand in television's late night alternative comedy slots. Note the way
Brand deliberately emphasises her natural unattractiveness in her dress,
hairstyle and facial expressions; listen to her man-hating diatribes, wonder
to yourself what would happen to a man who delivered a line as nasty as her
threat to sit on men's faces at certain times, and it is not hard to see why
no one offers her a prime time slot. If you point to the violent contempt
for all men expressed in the work of so many of these female comics and
suggest that this may have something to do with their unpopularity they
narrow their eyes and hiss remarks about 'centuries of mother-in-law jokes'
as though joking about a notoriously difficult relationship was
justification for spitting out a stream of hatred against half the human
race. It is difficult to imagine a nastier prejudice than that of these
female comics against all those who happen to be of a different sex.

FT  14 JUL 93 / Business and the Environment: Muddy waters - Plans to clean
up the heavily polluted Baltic Sea have stumbled over funding
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE KIRWIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Baltic Sea is one of the most polluted in the world, but the problem of
how to clean it up and who should foot the bill has plunged politicians,
bankers, and environmentalists into a lengthy controversy.
This has festered even though the Baltic coastal nations - including Sweden,
Denmark, Russia, Finland, Germany, and Poland - agreed more than a year ago
on an Dollars 18m (Pounds 12m) plan to restore the health of the world's
largest body of brackish water. The arguments have centred mainly on the
lending terms of development banks and the long-term benefits of the plan.
The debate came to a head at a recent conference in the Polish port city of
Gdansk where more than 100 designated environmental 'hotspots' in the region
were pinpointed. In what was billed as a 'resource mobilisation' meeting, it
proved to be another ministerial session where leaders from eastern Europe
looked for help and western European ministers pleaded poverty.
However, Denmark did pledge Dollars 5m this year and an overall increase in
Danish foreign development assistance in the next decade.
Svend Auken, Danish environment minister, took issue with the European Bank
for Development and Reconstruction and the Nordic Investment Bank. His
criticism amplified the frustrations eastern European leaders have expressed
for several years.
Since then, the EBRD has been castigated for spending heavily on itself and
being too slow to lend on new projects.
'We all had great expectations as to what the banks could offer, especially
the European development banks,' says Auken. 'I must say I am not impressed
with the willingness and capability of the international banks.
'Nothing will happen if the loans are only provided on market terms - that
is with western guarantees and market-level interest rates and high
consultants' fees to the banks.
'The banks will have to provide soft loans for this programme,' Auken adds.
'Only by doing so can they help to increase investments in environmental
improvements. A sewerage treatment plant is obviously not going to make the
same immediate return as a cement producing plant. So loans need to be
adjusted accordingly.'
The need to improve water quality in the Baltic Sea has become ever more
urgent. With more than 80m people in its catchment area, it is continually
flooded with dangerous concentrations of not only the typical sewerage
effluents of nitrogen and phosphorous, but also more toxic substances such
as PCBs, DDT, chlorine, mercury, lead, cadmium and others.
'The concentrations of organochlorine residues in fish in the Baltic proper
are three to 10 times higher than in those from the North Sea,' scientists
stated in a report released when the updated Baltic Sea convention was
signed two years ago in Sweden. 'More than 100,000 sq km are totally dead.'
Another source of pollution comes from chemical weapons dumped after the
second world war. The casings for these weapons have rusted at the bottom of
the sea and mustard gases and other chemicals are a particular problem in
various parts of the Baltic.
The deteriorating conditions in the Baltic are aggravated by geography and
an unusual marine ecology. The inflow of seawater from the North Sea past
the Danish and Swedish coasts is very limited and ice covers much of the
Baltic in winter. Thus its ability to clean itself is much more limited
compared with the North Sea or the oceans.
Concentrated efforts by the Nordic nations such as Sweden, Finland and
Denmark have been made to clean up the Baltic. One example is provided by
modern Swedish paper and pulp mills which have drastically reduced chlorine
emissions. Water quality in many of the Scandinavian coastal cities has
improved to the point where fish have returned and swimming is possible for
the first time in decades.
But local progress has been offset by pollution emissions not only from
Russia, Poland, the Baltic nations and the former East Germany, but also by
increased agricultural runoff from Denmark, Finland and southern Sweden.
The financial problems associated with the clean-up are not the only
controversy that has erupted over the action plan. Environmental groups such
as the Coalition for a Clean Baltic and Greenpeace have criticised it for
its emphasis on end-of-pipe solutions such as sewerage treatment plants.
'There must be much more of an emphasis on clean technology so as to control
diffuse sources of pollution like agricultural runoff,' says Jesper Grolin,
a Greenpeace representative who has worked closely with Baltic Sea issues.
The environmental groups have also criticised the financial problems of
implementing the plan. 'Even if governments from Scandinavia and Germany and
the others do not pledge the money now, they should at least commit
themselves to finding it,' Grolin says.
With aid loan money in short supply, several eastern European nations have
attempted to help themselves. Poland has started a Bank for Environmental
Protection, which has assets of more than Dollars 3bn raised from pollution
licence fees charged to industry and other pollution sources. Slovakia,
which also drains into the Baltic Sea basin, is expected to set up a similar
bank.
Poland and Slovakia have moved much further than Russia and the former
Soviet satellite nations in establishing local government bodies.
'This is essential if international institutions are going to put forward
loan money for a project such as a municipal sewerage treatment plant,' says
Piotr Krzyzanowski, a Polish government representative working with the
Baltic Sea convention.
'This is true whether it be for a soft loan or on market terms.'
George Toregas, an economist with the EBRD, says it will take more than the
establishment of local governments to allow loans for environment projects.
'If governments such as that of Denmark and others want us to make loans on
soft terms, they have to change regulations established when the bank was
set up.
'Governments run the boards of the bank and these were the rules we were
given. So it is hardly fair to blame us for not allowing soft loans to
eastern European nations.'

FT  14 JUL 93 / Management: Bridging the ethical gap - Values may differ
widely from behaviour
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There is often a wide gap between companies' professed values and their
actual behaviour, or at least the public's perception of it.
That is the main conclusion to be drawn from two separate, but far from
contradictory, surveys of senior business executives published this week.
The importance of being ethical* - by Ashridge Management Research Group and
the UK consultancy Integrity Works - concentrates largely on the views of
non-executive directors of Britain's leading companies.
All 119 respondents in the report felt business ethics was a significant
issue, even if there was little consensus about what the term meant. But
while the majority thought it 'very important' for business to be viewed as
ethical, less than half felt this to be the case in practice. More than a
quarter thought that the public views business as 'quite unethical'.
That said, 54 per cent of respondents consider that company standards are
better than they were 10 years ago - 22 per cent said they were worse - and
43 per cent disclosed that their firm operates an ethics code. Thirteen per
cent have adopted the practice of 'ethics awareness training', while a
further 8 per cent carry out an ethics audit.
The findings of the Ashridge research reinforce the view that an
organisation's conduct is largely dependent on the stance of its chief
executive.
Many of the conclusions, moreover, find an echo in the other study -
Insights into values in business** carried out by the Helsinki-based
consultancy Values into Action and based on responses from 70 senior
executives 'in Britain, the Nordic countries, Europe and beyond'.
Three in five said they conduct their business activities and practices
according to a common code of values. But more than three quarters of these
believed there was a gap between ethical values and actual behaviour, and
one in five said that business necessity overrides such values.
Values into Action adds that a study of more than 400 annual reports
highlights the need to clarify use of the word 'value'. It makes the
distinction between 'business values', which are situational and relative,
and 'ethical values', which are universal and absolute. Corporate value
codes - which often look more like corporate goals than value statements -
should explain how they relate to each other.
Values into Action says managers who want to check their companies' 'ethical
health' should ask themselves whether the following are true or false:
1. People in the company conduct their business activities and practices
according to the same code of values.
2. Because of the current (economic) situation, there is less time to show
employees the consideration they deserve as individuals.
3. Survival depends on getting back to basics, cutting costs and reducing
overheads.
4. Faced with a choice, business necessity overrides ethical values.
5. Sometimes there is a gap between ethical values and the way in which the
company and/or people in it behave.
6. Management trusts employees and employees trust management.
7. Sometimes there is a discrepancy between what executives preach and what
they expect their colleagues and employees to practice.
8. People willingly and genuinely want to put the values of the company into
practice.
9. We accept and honour our responsibilities towards other 'stakeholders'
(those who are taken into account when business decisions are being made, or
who are affected by the outcome of business decisions) as well as customers,
shareholders and employees.
10. Frank, fearless and critical dialogue both upwards and downwards in the
company is actively encouraged and practised. * Price Pounds 40, available

FT  14 JUL 93 / Management: Female progress by the book - Why have women
made it to the top of publishing but so few other professions?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCY KELLAWAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Frances Coady is not Oxbridge educated. With her black leather jacket, mini
skirt and scarlet lipstick she does not fit the classic picture of a boss.
Yet this 34-year-old has just been given one of the best jobs in British
publishing: running the literary imprints of Random House - Jonathan Cape,
Chatto and Windus, Vintage and Pimlico.
At the same time, Kate Parkin, also in her early 30s and just back from
maternity leave, has been put in charge of the more mass-market publishing
names Century and Arrow. Carmen Callil, 20 years older and the industry's
grande dame, has become grander still as publisher-at-large of the Random
House group.
The glass ceiling is lying in shards at the feet of the Random House women.
At the centre stands Gail Rebuck, who became chief executive 18 months ago,
and is the most powerful of the lot.
'This shouldn't be a great story, but it is,' says Coady. When she started
in publishing in 1982 as a secretary at Faber &amp; Faber there were only two
women close to the top: Callil who founded Virago and went on to manage
Chatto, and Liz Calder who was the first woman on the board at Jonathan
Cape.
Now both have moved on to greater things (Calder has set up Bloomsbury)
while the list of big female names in British publishing has lengthened.
Paula Kahn is managing director of Longman. Philippa Harrison runs Little,
Brown. Other women have started their own companies: Victoria Barnsley at
Fourth Estate and Sarah Mahaffy at Boxwood.
But have women really made it in publishing? And if so is publishing a model
for other industries, or is it somehow a special case?
In sheer bulk, book publishing is dominated by women. They make up more than
60 per cent of the workforce, but only 40 per cent of the managers and 20
per cent of the directors, according to the Hansard Society Commission. That
is still much better than in the economy as a whole, where 25 per cent of
junior managers and less than 2 per cent of senior ones are women.
Anecdotal evidence suggests that women are increasingly making their
presence felt in senior, if not in the most senior, jobs. One London
Business School student was surprised to find himself interviewed
exclusively by women at each of the four publishing houses to which he had
applied for a job.
But according to Kahn, nearly all the big decisions are still being taken by
men. 'There are a number of very high-profile women managing major editorial
departments, but when it comes to women with significant financial and
commercial power, there are really only two, Gail Rebuck and myself,' she
complains.
So two things need explaining: why women do better in publishing than
elsewhere, and why their absolute majority at the bottom still translates
into a minority at the top. One answer to the first question is that
publishing is something women are good at. Calder sees it as an 'enabling,
servicing job', with editors playing a 'shepherding and championing' role.
Rebuck talks about the feminine traits of creativity, the instinct and flair
needed in a publisher, but then thinks better of it. 'That's all rubbish,'
she says, deciding that the real reason is the entry policy. Traditionally,
a young woman with a degree but no particular training could get a job in
publishing as a secretary or assistant. 'No one else would employ them.'
The pay for these young hopefuls was pitifully low. When Coady, who has
degrees from Sussex and Essex Universities, was taken on in 1982 she was
offered less than Pounds 3,000. 'I couldn't believe it. They obviously
expected me to have a private income,' she says.
She, in common with many others, proved her worth and was rapidly promoted.
'Because many of the women had brains and gumption they got on,' says
Rebuck.
But why haven't they got on still further and in greater number? One reason
may have been a lack of ambition, at least on the part of some of the older
women. 'Women of my generation have not wanted to be the ultimate boss, but
younger women don't all feel that way,' says Calder.
Another problem, says Rebuck, is that women who have made it as editors may
fear - wrongly - the financial responsibility that comes with moving up the
mangement ladder. 'It's not as hard as it's cracked up to be. I haven't had
any formal training with numbers and I don't need one. All you need is a bit
of common sense.'
Recent changes in the industry may also be in women's favour. Until
recently, publishing was a shambolic cottage industry with highly
paternalistic ways. According to Kahn, women lost out in this informal
environment. 'In a small family firm it is only great if you happen to be
the daughter,' she says.
The bigger companies have given the industry its first taste of formal equal
opportunities policies: a decade ago maternity leave - if any - was decided
on an ad hoc basis. Now companies are vying with each other to offer the
best maternity deals. Faber &amp; Faber and Longman have recently agreed to pay
towards employees' childcare costs.
The reorganisation has also started a game of musical chairs in senior
positions: men who had seemed likely to remain forever in their jobs have
moved, and some have been replaced by women.
Just as the balance is shifting towards women at the middle and the top of
the industry, the reverse is happening at the bottom. The higher salaries
are drawing in more men, who are increasingly prepared to start as
secretaries. 'The young men don't come with all that baggage any more.
They've got mothers who worked,' says Rebuck. Both Rebuck and Coady have had
male secretaries - something that would raise no eyebrows in the US where
some 60 per cent of publishing assistants and secretaries are male.
The experience of the women who have made it in publishing, and of those who
work for them, suggests that the sex of the people at the top does make a
difference. Coady says that women's attitude to power is less political: 'I
look at power in relation to what I am doing. Power is desirable to me if it
means I can put my ideas about writers and books into work.'
Rebuck agrees: 'There is that element of Machiavellian charm of men in
publishing. They meander around the point, and you walk out of the office
and do not realise until later that you have been carved up. Women are more
direct.'
Women are also said to communicate better. One female employee commented
with approval that when Rebuck took over she went round the office talking
to everyone. 'You wouldn't find a man doing that.'
They work harder, says Coady, who admits to being a 'complete workaholic'.
Rebuck, who hurries home every night to see her two children, has had to
become an efficient user of time. However, their view from the top is not
altogether pleasant. As pioneers, they are constantly subjected to a great
deal of attention, not all of it flattering. Carmen Callil is used to
reading that she is a nightmare to work for, while Rebuck learnt from the
trade press that she got the job by stabbing her predecessor in the back.
Such talk, argues Coady, is heard every time a woman gets into a position of
power. 'You've always got people trying to explain why you've got the job,'
she says. Rebuck complains that 'women in power are often criticised for
being tough. But if they are not tough there is a suggestion that they are
not up to the job.'
She also finds that many men do not know how to deal with her. 'They have
run out of stereotypes,' she says. She tells the story of a middle-aged male
journalist asking her whether she could sense any sexual tension when she
chaired board meetings. She rolls her eyes and laughs.
That brave new world is still a fiction in which women are in charge and the
men do the typing without either party feeling they are doing anything odd.
But if one day it is to become fact, it could well be in books first.

FT  14 JUL 93 / Business and the Environment: Battle for the heartland of
South America - Plans to create a 3,400km waterway
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The rivers of South America have been largely untravelled since they were
used by conquistadores, explorers and traders to settle the continent's
heartland. Now, once again, the peace may be about to be disrupted.
Plans are under way to transform the Paraguay and Parana rivers into a
3,400km waterway that would link the often impoverished interior with
seaports at the River Plate estuary. The waterway would be quick, easy and
cheap to create.
The governments of Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay, whose
territory the rivers flow through, are seeking international finance to set
up the waterway, known as the Hidrovia. It could become one of the region's
biggest development projects since the construction of the Itaipu dam in the
1980s.
Predictably, the project has met with hostility from environmentalists.
Argentine and US scientists said in a recently published study that the
Hidrovia could threaten the environment. They also doubted its economic
viability. The report, produced by Wetlands for the Americas, a conservation
group, and supported by the prestigious Woods Hole Research Institute in the
US, warns of water pollution from spills of oil and chemical cargoes.
River life, wildlife and the surrounding land would be affected by the
increased river traffic and the civil engineering projects required to make
the rivers navigable.
The main threat, says the report, is to Brazil's vast Pantanal marshland.
The 200,000 sq km Pantanal not only supports a rich diversity of wildlife,
but acts as a gigantic sponge, regulating water levels in the Paraguay
river. Damaging the Pantanal's sponge function 'may result in an overlap of
the peak flooding period in both the Parana and Paraguay rivers, which can
increase the risk of both catastrophic rises and extreme lows in water level
along the middle and lower Parana River'.
Changes in the region's hydrology would exacerbate alterations already
caused by the large Itaipu dam and add to potential impacts caused by other
dams under construction on the Paraguay and Parana Rivers.
The Hidrovia could also cause further problems. 'It is very likely that the
greatest environmental impacts caused by the Hidrovia will be indirect,
given the rapid development process that may follow the starting of the
operations in the waterway,' the report says.
Better transport would inevitably increase human occupation and bring
environmental disruption. This could also lead to an expansion of diseases
such as malaria, dengue and yellow fever and the spread of water-borne
diseases.
The Hidrovia would help bring vast new areas of land under cultivation in
the heart of the continent, replacing native vegetation. This could increase
soil erosion and the silting of rivers. Increased use of agrochemicals would
damage river life. Industrial mining and gold wildcatting, which already
threaten the Pantanal, could also increase.
The authors attack as superficial a previous economic feasibility study
carried out by Brazilian consultants which estimated the Hidrovia's rate of
return at 16-23 per cent. This report has been used by governments to
support the Hidrovia's viability. But Wetlands for the Americas claims that
the benefits are overstated and environmental costs are not taken into
consideration.
Without attempting a detailed estimate of these costs, the Wetlands report
says the economic benefits are probably significantly less than claimed and
could even be negative.
However, Jesus Gonzalez, the Argentine government official on the Hidrovia's
executive committee, recently promised a full-scale environmental impact
study, and said the project would be shelved if the potential damage were
too high. This is in keeping with greater government sensitivity to the
environment throughout the region. Governments are under pressure from
industrial countries, lending agencies and to some extent their own
populations to protect the environment. The Inter-American Development Bank
is financing environmental consultants to carry out impact studies.
However, experience in Latin America has shown that government assurances to
safeguard the environment must be treated with scepticism.
The Wetlands' report is only an opening shot in a battle between
environmentalists and a powerful development lobby of farmers, international
lending agencies, big business and governments that is likely to become
increasingly bitter.

FT  14 JUL 93 / Popular touch urged for BBC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BBC needs to broadcast more relaxing popular entertainment programmes
because large sections of the audience are not being well served.
This tentative conclusion has emerged during a review of programme strategy
by Ms Liz Forgan, managing director of BBC Radio, and Mr Alan Yentob,
controller of BBC1.
Ms Forgan said yesterday: 'The BBC is brilliant at serving upmarket and
minority audiences.' It was much less good, she added, at serving the C and
D social groups.
She said that in the past few years the BBC had focused a lot of attention
and resources on news and current affairs. It was now time to put greater
emphasis on entertainment.
The conclusions, which came from detailed audience research, also suggested
that the BBC seemed remote and old-fashioned to sections of its audience.
But as the BBC was hinting at new programme strategies the ITV network was
suggesting it was planning to move up market.
Launching a Pounds 173m programme schedule for the autumn, Mr Marcus
Plantin, the ITV network director, said the schedule was aimed to attract
younger, more upmarket audiences. Mr Mark Tully, the BBC's veteran India
correspondent, yesterday delivered his promised attack on the way Mr John
Birt, the BBC director-general, is running the corporation.
Mr Tully told the Radio Academy Festival in Birmingham that he did not think
Mr Birt understood 'what the BBC was, or indeed what it should become'.
There was a very real sense of fear among the staff which prevented people
speaking their minds, he added.
Mr Tully warned that there was a threat to the BBC's talent base from the
practice of putting more staff on short-term contracts.
No one could do their best work if they were always worrying about their
next contract, he said.
BBC chiefs yesterday rejected Mr Tully's criticisms. Mr Tony Hall, managing
director of news and current affairs, said: 'It is not surprising that staff
are unsettled by the changes that are happening.
'But criticism is not being stifled - indeed we are stressing the need for
debate about our purpose.'

MR Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary to the Treasury, confirmed in the
Commons last night that the first unified budget was likely to be introduced
'at the end of November'.
He also gave a further assurance that the time available for the finance
bill to be scrutinised by MPs under the new procedure would be 'marginally
increased'.
Mr Nick Brown, a Labour treasury spokesman, feared that the timetable
envisaged by the government for future years would result in the finance
bill not being published until after Christmas with MPs being pressed to
complete the committee stage before the Easter recess.

<TEXT>
MR MICHAEL Portillo, chief secretary to the Treasury, last night stressed
that the elements in Britain's Pounds 50bn public sector borrowing
requirement attributable to cyclical factors would not automatically unwind
as the recession ended.
Before the Finance Bill was given its third Commons reading by a majority of
37 (311-274), Mr Portillo warned that the constraints on public expenditure
agreed by the cabinet were more challenging than was realised by some
Conservatives.
Mr Portillo thanked those Tory MPs who had supported the government in
taking the unpopular decision to extend VAT to domestic fuel, and he hoped
they would also support the specific measures which would be needed to
ensure that the spending totals would not be exceeded.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR KENNETH Clarke, the chancellor, will next week make an official visit to
Germany in an attempt to strengthen economic relations between the two
countries and smooth over any residual tensions between the Treasury and
Bundesbank, Peter Norman writes.
In a packed two-day schedule Mr Clarke will dine with industrialists and
bankers in Frankfurt on Sunday, lunch with Mr Hans Tietmeyer, the Bundesbank
president-designate, on Monday and meet Mr Theo Waigel, the German finance
minister, in his home city of Munich later that day. In Munich the
chancellor will give a speech that is expected to develop the UK's ideas for
improving Europe's international competitiveness through supply side
policies.
UK officials played down suggestions that the chancellor would be pushing
for German interest rate cuts. But while Mr Clarke's trip may lack a
specific policy goal, it will mark a notable change of style from that of Mr
Norman Lamont, his predecessor.

FT  14 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Lib Dems press fuel VAT attack
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A TORY DEFEAT in the Christchurch by-election could force the government to
reverse plans to impose value added tax on domestic fuel, the Liberal
Democrats said yesterday.
The Lib Dems tried to exploit Monday's backbench rebellion on the issue,
which cut the government's Commons majority to eight votes, while Labour
sought to turn the heat on Mr John Major in the Commons.
Mrs Diana Maddock, the Liberal Democrat candidate in this month's election,
said people felt they had been cheated by a party that 'lambasted' its
opponents for advocating higher taxes. She was supported by Mr Paddy
Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, who said Christchurch voters had a
chance to shape the next Budget.
Their remarks came as Mr William Powell, the MP for Corby who was among
Monday's rebels, predicted that imposing VAT on fuel would cost the
Conservatives the by-election.
At Westminster Mr John Smith launched a concerted attack on the issue,
accusing the government of betraying election promises.
The Labour leader urged Mr Major to apologise to voters for pressing ahead
with the proposal to levy VAT on fuel in spite of past Conservative
promises. He asked: 'Do you deny that you have cynically betrayed an
election pledge?'
Mr Major countered by saying Labour was 'looking at' VAT on fuel and had
once excluded fuel from a list of items on which it thought VAT should not
be imposed.
Turning his fire on the Liberal Democrats, the prime minister said they had
also advocated a tax on energy in a recent policy document. 'Perhaps you
will go back to Christchurch and tell them that,' he said.
The exchanges triggered a flurry of correspondence. Sir Norman Fowler, the
Conservative chairman, wrote to Mr Ashdown and Mr Smith reiterating the
comments made by Mr Major, while Mr Chris Smith, Labour's environment
spokesman, wrote to the prime minister denying Labour had ever supported VAT
on fuel.
Challenged on her party's energy policy at the Dorset seaside town where one
in three residents is a pensioner and the Conservatives are defending a
majority of 23,000, Mrs Maddock said imposing VAT on fuel and introducing a
carbon tax were 'quite different things'. She confirmed her party favoured a
carbon tax.
Mr Robert Hayward, the Tory candidate, said he supported the overall
economic package of which broadening the VAT base was a part but stressed
that the government had said it would provide help for those on low incomes.

FT  14 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Government confident of defeating
referendum move
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GOVERNMENT business managers expressed confidence yesterday that the attempt
in the House of Lords today to bring about a referendum on Maastricht would
be defeated.
But evidence of their determination to take no chances came in a briefing
note from Tory Central Office, countering arguments put forward by the
referendum campaigners on Monday.
Tactics for dealing with the more serious challenge to the government's
ratification plans posed by the Commons social chapter debate later this
month were discussed yesterday by senior ministers.
They agreed that in order to leave the greatest possible freedom of
manoeuvre, the government should not spell out publicly what it would do if
it were defeated. Labour has had an amendment agreed to the motion for
debate, saying that the treaty should not be ratified until the UK has
committed itself to the social agreement.
Yesterday's briefing note to peers particularly targeted Lady Thatcher, who
made it clear earlier this week that she intended to vote against the
three-line Tory whip and in favour of a referendum.
Her speech in 1975 against a referendum was extensively quoted against the
line that the campaign for a referendum was neutral and could be supported
both by those in favour of Maastricht as well as those against the treaty.
The note also rejected the suggestion that the government was trying to
force peers to vote for a referendum by threatening to resign. 'Scare
tactics may be part of others' strategy, but the government has no need of
them,' it said.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Clifford Smout, who is just 36, is being promoted to the position of deputy
head of the Bank of England's supervision division, in charge of supervisory
policy; he replaces Richard Farrant, the new chief executive of the
Securities and Futures Authority. A decade younger than the other three
deputies, he will report to Michael Foot, who is to take over from Roger
Barnes.
An economics graduate from Clare College, Cambridge, Smout joined the Bank
in 1978, initially in the international division, concentrating on economic
forecasting. His next port of call was money markets, and, following the
implementation of the Financial Services Act, he became involved in setting
up the division supervising wholesale money markets. Between 1987 and 1989
he was private secretary to the then deputy governor Sir George Blunden. He
moved on to the foreign exchange side, and then into his most recent job -
manager in the supervision division in charge of North American banks.

FT  14 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Fierce battle ahead as MPs weigh
reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PARLIAMENTARY battle over Sunday trading will be a fraught game of bluff
and tactical manoeuvring between the competing lobby groups that may well
end up with the rules on opening hours unchanged.
With ministers still wincing at memories of the government's ignominious
1986 defeat when it tried to deregulate opening hours completely, the Home
Office is putting the onus on MPs to decide how Sunday trading should be
reformed.
The bill will be formally presented to the Commons in the legislative
session beginning in November. The first main debate, or 'second reading'
will be on the principle of reforming the 1950 Shops Act.
The battle proper will not come until the bill is considered in detail by a
committee of the whole Commons. The Speaker will decide the order in which
MPs vote on the four options selected by the government - but probably with
total deregulation first. Once one option wins a majority, the others will
fall.
A special feature of yesterday's bill is that if, as seems entirely
possible, no option wins a majority, the government would be able to ask the
Commons to vote again at a later date without the need for the entire
legislation to be re-considered. That could be after a general election. In
the meantime, the 1950 Act would continue.
The House of Lords will also vote on the same options. If it chooses a
different version to the Commons, MPs will have to vote again.
The government has separated the issue of employee protection. But Labour
and Liberal Democrat MPs, and possibly some Tories, will propose amendments
to enhance the rights of future employees who work on Sundays, as well as
the rights of existing employees. Conservative MPs will almost certainly be
whipped to vote against them.
But if employee rights are not improved, opposition MPs could vote against
the bill on its third and final reading, even if they back the reform option
eventually selected. Together with those unhappy about the option chosen,
they may defeat the bill.
Mrs Joan Ruddock, who speaks for Labour on home affairs, said: 'That will
always be the threat that hangs over the government - that the whole
legislation may end up being voted down at the final stage if they don't
satisfy us all on protection of future, as well as existing, workers.'
Government business managers have yet to decide if Tory MPs will have a free
vote on third reading.

FT  14 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Clarke trip aims to smooth tensions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR KENNETH Clarke, the chancellor, unveils a further facet of his
chancellorship next week when he visits Germany to strengthen economic
relations between the two countries and smooth over any residual tensions
between the Treasury and Bundesbank.
After Mr Clarke, the friend of industry, and Ken Clarke, the 'straight from
the shoulder' political chancellor who tells voters of possible tax
increases and welfare cuts, the public will be presented with a chancellor
who beats the drum for Britain 'at the heart of Europe'.
In a packed two-day schedule Mr Clarke will dine with industrialists and
bankers in Frankfurt on Sunday, lunch with Mr Hans Tietmeyer, the Bundesbank
president-designate, on Monday and meet Mr Theo Waigel, the German finance
minister, in his home city of Munich later that day. In Munich the
chancellor will give a speech that is expected to develop the UK's ideas for
improving Europe's international competitiveness through supply side
policies.
UK officials played down suggestions that the chancellor would be pushing
for German interest rate cuts. But while Mr Clarke's trip may lack a
specific policy goal, it will mark a notable change of style from that of Mr
Norman Lamont, his predecessor.
The Euro-sceptic Mr Lamont made no secret of his lack of enthusiasm for
meeting European finance ministers.
He also mishandled relations with the Bundesbank, nearly provoking a
walk-out by Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the German Bundesbank president, at last
September's meeting of EC finance ministers and central bank governors in
Bath shortly before sterling was forced to leave the European exchange rate
mechanism.
There is no record of Mr Lamont ever visiting the Bundesbank as chancellor,
whereas Mr Clarke will meet Germany's independent central bankers less than
two months after moving into 11 Downing Street.
Mr Clarke's meeting with Mr Waigel will be his third in a fortnight, after
bilateral talks with the German minister in Tokyo last week and Monday's
economic and finance ministers' council in Brussels.

FT  14 JUL 93 / People: Read plugs into Logica network
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Logica, the computing services company, is strengthening its senior
management by promoting David Mann into the new position of deputy chairman,
and bringing in Martin Read (right) as the next managing director and chief
executive.
Paul Bosonnet, who took over when Logica's founder Philip Hughes stepped
down in 1990, says that, unlike Hughes, he is a part-time chairman 'with the
accent very much on the part-time'. This means that he has 'had very little
involvement with customers'. Hence Mann, who has been at Logica since 1969,
will be able to devote more time to customers and industry partners now he
is freed of day-to-day management responsibilities.
Meanwhile, 43-year-old Read has been headhunted from GEC-Marconi. Appointed
managing director of Marconi Command and Control Systems in 1989, he was
then made managing director of Marconi Radar and Control Systems on the 1991
merger with Marconi Radar. In the following year he also took on the
supervisory managing directorship of the GEC systems engineering company
EASAMS, as well as the GEC-Marconi Research Centre. This year he collected
similar roles at GEC Computer Services and GEC-Marconi Software Systems, an
accumulation of extra responsibilities that Bosonnet calls 'very
encouraging'.
'We were looking for somebody who did not replicate everything we already
had inside Logica,' says the chairman. 'He is not unfamiliar with software
and he has enough educational background to understand our business.' Read
has a natural sciences degree from Cambridge and an Oxford DPhil in physics.
He is also expected to inject more than a whiff of the culture of his
previous employer. 'Coming from GEC he is a little more hard-nosed and
commercially-oriented; we inevitably start from our interest in technology,'
as Bosonnet puts it.
However, despite holding down international management positions for
Overseas Containers and International Paint before joing GEC-Marconi in
1985, he has no real operating experience in the US, where Logica continues
to experience difficulties. 'If you compile a list of all the attributes you
want, you rule yourself and everybody else out,' Bosonnet says
philosophically.
While Read becomes boss of a publicly listed company, Logica, which employs
3,300 people and has annual sales of Pounds 200m, is considerably smaller
than the outfits he has been running. Marconi Radar and Control Systems
alone sees a turnover of Pounds 310m and has more than 4,000 employees.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM KING and RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONCERN ABOUT protection for shop workers' rights was the common element in
reaction yesterday to the government's White Paper and draft bill on Sunday
trading.
The various lobby groups disagreed sharply about how the law should be
reformed but were united in calling for reform to be accompanied by
guaranteed employment rights.
Home Secretary Mr Michael Howard would only support protecting those
employed as shopworkers at the time that any changes to the law came into
effect.
Mrs Joan Ruddock, Labour's home affairs spokesman, said she would press hard
for protection for future, as well as existing, employees who have to work
on Sundays. She said the party's MPs supported changing the 1950 Shops Act
but added: 'We can say with confidence that complete de-regulation is not
something that Labour MPs will vote for.'
Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader, also backed reform but said he
would judge the legislation according to whether it protected employees,
preserved to some extent the special nature of Sundays, and gave some
flexibility to local authorities in deciding what shops could open and when.
The shop workers' union Usdaw said it was totally opposed to plans for
deregulating Sunday trading.
Mr Garfield Davies, the union's general secretary, said
any new law should enshrine voluntary working so that workers who did not
want to work on Sundays would not be discriminated against.
Usdaw also demanded legal entitlement to double-time pay for Sunday working.
Mr Michael Schluter, director of the Keep Sunday Special Campaign, said:
'KSSC will not accept any government bill, however many the options, unless
shop workers are adequately protected from being compelled to work on a
Sunday and properly remunerated if they choose to do so.'
The John Lewis Partnership gave its support to KSSC, saying it represented
the best balance for society as a whole.
The Retailers for Shops Act Reform, which represents some of the UK's
largest retailers including Marks and Spencer, would allow Sunday opening
for small convenience and leisure shops of not more than 3,000 sq ft and all
garden centres and DIY shops.
Mr Geoffrey Maitland Smith, chairman of Sears, another RSAR member, said
Sunday trading was not financially attractive except at Christmas. He said
that outside big cities it could present problems with stock delivery and
staffing.
The group closest to the government's preference is the Shopping Hours
Reform Council, which would allow shops below 3,000 sq ft unrestricted
opening, but larger shops could open for not more than six hours between
10am and 6pm. This option is supported by the big supermarket chains and the
retail group Kingfisher.
SHRC chairman Baroness Jay said their option was popular, practical and
permanent, adding that it would solve the problem of Sunday trading once and
for all. But SHRC parts company with the government in wanting statutory
employee protection.
The Association of District Councils, which represents many local
authorities that enforce the current Shops Act, said its main concern was
that whatever reform was made should be legally enforceable.

FT  14 JUL 93 / People: Eleco snaps up Callaghan as its chief executive
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Eleco, the building products, contracting and distribution company, has
replaced its former chief executive 41-year-old Michael Webster, who had
been in the position for the past six years, with Australian-born Peter
Callaghan.
Chairman Field Walton explains: 'We had some rather dreadful interim
results, which had concerned the whole board.' In February, the company
reported a Pounds 2.21m loss for second half 1992.
Together with two recently appointed non-executives, Walton says he
approached the executive management and explained that he expected to see
changes. 'It was the style of management more than anything else. The
approach had worked very well for acquiring businesses. But the new
acquisitions tended to have been treated as investments. The (recessionary
climate) demanded more hands-on management.'
Of Callaghan, he says: 'It is amazing he has not been snapped up before
now,' adding that he is 'very user-friendly and has a good sense of humour'.
His 'hands-on' management abilities, Walton believes, were demonstrated at
Camford Engineering, where he was co-opted as deputy chairman by Markheath
Securities to turn round the automotive components manufacturer before
selling it on to Hoesch.
It is understood Callaghan was offered a job by Hoesch both at its German
headquarters and in Houston, within its American operation, but that he had
declined. For the past 18 months he has been doing corporate advisory work.
A production engineer by training, 42-year-old Callaghan also studied
business administration in the early 1980s at the New South Wales Institute
of Technology - where, coincidentally, Walton had once been offered a
teaching post. He then worked for Australian resources company Peko Wallsend
before moving to Natcorp Investments where he was operations director.

FT  14 JUL 93 / Political Notebook: The price of Maastricht
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN will ratify Maastricht. The only question remaining is whether the
treaty has the potential still to destroy Mr John Major's premiership.
That - as has most of the tortuous process during which Mr Major has
struggled to salvage a single point from what he once claimed as game, set
and match - needs some explanation.
After a year of ruinous conflict in the Tory party the bill to give legal
force to the treaty is within sight of Royal Assent. If Mr Major is
fortunate it will be signed and sealed before MPs depart for their Umbrian
villas at the end of July.
But two minefields remain.
The first lies in the House of Lords, where Lady Thatcher is promising today
to blemish her parliamentary career by voting against her party for the
first time in 34 years.
In spite of the pledge of Lord Rees-Mogg and his fellow backwoodsmen to
follow their heroine into the division lobbies in support of a referendum,
Mr Major is quietly confident she will not derail the treaty. The odds are
that a majority will recognise the inherent illogicality of an unelected,
un-accountable chamber demanding the people should decide.
If for some obscure reason they do not, the prime minister's battered
reputation will take another severe knock. Ratification would be further
delayed. But eventually the House of Commons, which has already voted
overwhelmingly against a referendum, would overturn the peers.
The second, more serious, threat lies in the subsequent vote by MPs on the
social chapter. Here we hit the legal technicalities. But it is important
they are understood because this vote might - and the conditional tense is
important - fatally wound Mr Major.
During the spring an unholy alliance of opposition parties and Tory
Euro-sceptics forced through an amendment related to Britain's opt-out from
the treaty's social provisions.
The amendment states that final ratification - the physical transfer of the
legal instruments to Rome - can take place only after MPs and peers have
voted on the wisdom or otherwise of the opt-out. It does not specify that
MPs must support the deal negotiated by Mr Major, merely that a vote must
take place on a motion tabled by the government after the bill has become
law.
The trap lies in another amendment being framed by the Labour party. In
essence the new amendment, on which MPs will vote alongside the government
motion, will say this: even though Maastricht has been enacted, the treaty
itself should not be ratified unless the opt-out is scrapped.
Labour is drafting the change in close consultation with the Tory sceptics.
If the opposition can persuade a dozen or so of the rebels to join them then
Mr Major could be defeated. The sceptics, of course, do not want the social
chapter. But some of the diehards see in it a last chance to wreck the whole
process. After all, Mr Major has declared he could never abandon the
opt-out.
So in the event of a government defeat Mr John Smith would demand the prime
minister embrace the social chapter while the sceptics - including perhaps
one or two in the cabinet - would insist he abandon the entire treaty.
Of course it is not that simple. Mr Major might simply ignore the vote and
complete the ratification process regardless. It would be messy - and
probably subject to later judicial challenge - but better than leaving
Britain isolated in Europe.
Politics though would count for much more than legal sophistry. It is far
from clear Mr Major could survive such a blow to his authority. Whatever the
advice of the lawyers, however perverse the motivation of some Tory MPs, it
might be impossible also to ignore the expressed will of parliament.
All these issues were discussed in detail by the prime minister and his most
senior colleagues yesterday. They concluded not to disclose their intentions
in advance of the social chapter debate.
Perhaps they have a masterplan, overlooked so far by their opponents. More
likely they believe that uncertainty offers the best chance of unnerving the
Tory sceptics.
Some in the government disagree. They want Mr Major to give an unequivocal
commitment to ratify come what may - a public warning to the rebels that if
Britain were to end up with the treaty plus the social chapter they not the
government would bear the blame.
Perhaps life is not that simple. And the same message presumably can be
conveyed to the sceptics as effectively in private as in public. But the
reality there is no other option but to ratify Maastricht. A majority in the
cabinet - foreign secretary and chancellor among them - could not accept a
different outcome.
The sceptics eventually may understand this and vote for once with their own
party. The strengthening economic recovery might then refloat Mr Major's
government. But what price his premiership if he does lose in the Commons on
the social chapter and then suffers a crushing defeat in the Christchurch
by-election?

THE DAILY Mirror seems to have held on to and even increased its circulation
yesterday in spite of being 7p more expensive than The Sun, its main rival.
Industry sources suggested that the Mirror increased sales by about 2 per
cent. Daily Mirror sales in June were more than 2.6m a day.
Early estimates suggested that The Sun's price cut of 5p to 20p for the
summer was having a modest effect so far, with sales up by about 220,000

increased activity in the Civil Service.
Executive agencies would deliver greater efficiency, he said.

LLOYD'S OF London announced last night that lossmaking Names and their

to negotiate an out-of-court settlement. The panel was set up last month.
Names - the individuals whose assets support the market - and lawyers acting
for the errors and omissions insurers, which cover agents against negligence
awards and would fund a settlement, had been at odds about the status of any
conclusions reached by the panel.
Lloyd's said that although the panel's legal evaluation would not be
binding, it would be able to make a settlement offer.
Solicitor Mr Harold Weston, who faced bankruptcy after incurring losses on
the Lloyd's market, hanged himself in despair in April, an inquest at
Hornsey, north London, heard yesterday.
A verdict of suicide was recorded on Mr Weston, 51, of Cricklewood, north

INTENSE competition is forcing construction prices down to suicidal levels,
the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors warned yesterday, Andrew Taylor
writes.
It said that contractors' tender prices had fallen 3 per cent in the first
three months of this year - the lowest level since 1986. But contractors'
construction costs were expected to rise 5.5 per cent in the next 24 months.
The institution added that spare capacity among contractors meant that
tender prices were unlikely to rise until well into next year. Its tender
price index had fallen 25 per cent since 1989.

FT  14 JUL 93 / MP implicates building society in 'fraud'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER and SCHEHEREZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WEST Bromwich Building Society yesterday called for a Tory MP to give
evidence to the police after he accused it of being implicated in 'forgery
and fraud' over loans made to elderly investors through home income schemes.
Mr William Powell, MP for Corby, said in the Commons that 'a great deal of
criminal activity has been taking place' in relation to home-income plans
taken out by 800 people. The schemes aimed to unlock capital in investors'
homes in the late 1980s.
Mr Powell said that West Bromwich, which lent about Pounds 24m through such
schemes, had tried to avoid responsibility in an 'utterly scandalous, deeply
shocking' way, that would 'merit much closer attention, particularly by the
police'.
Mr Glenn Elliot, the society's chief executive, said that he was 'horrified
and appalled' that Mr Powell had used parliamentary privilege to make the
accusation. He called for Mr Powell to produce any evidence to the police.
Mr Elliot said: 'We have certainly not committed fraud, and if a financial
adviser has been involved in fraud or forgery, we have no knowledge of it.'
Mr Powell said he had seen documents signed by constituents which were
changed after being signed.
He said incomes had been falsified on the forms 'in order to justify the
pushing out of much larger sums' than they wished to borrow.
He said this had resulted in 'misery across the country' and in one case an
elderly constituent had committee suicide. The society said that it was
'wrong' for Mr Powell to speculate that it had caused an investor's suicide.
Many of West Bromwich's home-income loans were made after investors were
sold schemes by the broker Fisher Prew-Smith, which was fined Pounds 20,000
by the insurance brokers' regulator Fimbra for its conduct and went into
liquidation in 1991.
Investment-linked home-income schemes were devised in the late 1980s. The
idea was to take out a mortgage and invest the proceeds in the hope of
earning a return large enough to meet the repayments as well as providing
extra income.
Many advisers backed the plans with single-premium investment bonds. When
the value of these fell because of poor stock market performance and
interest rates rose, investors ran into financial difficulties.
The building society ombudsmen have been hampered in investigating home
income plans because these fall outside their jurisdiction, and they require
the prior consent of the building society.
West Bromwich is one of nine building societies which have refused to
co-operate with the ombudsman scheme. Mr Elliot said yesterday that it would
co-operate with the complaints procedure if it received certain guarantees.

FT  14 JUL 93 / Chemical safety failures found
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORE THAN a quarter of employers do not comply with health and safety
regulations on hazardous substances nearly four years after the introduction
of new rules, research by the Health and Safety Executive yesterday
revealed.
The executive said it was 'encouraged' that 71 per cent of employers
surveyed had implemented the Control of Substances Hazardous to Health
Regulations 'satisfactorily or with just minor shortcomings'.
However, the MSF general technical union yesterday accused the executive of
complacency over the research results. Ms Judith Church, the union's health
and safety officer, said: 'We know the ICIs and DuPonts have done a lot of
work on Coshh. The problem is in the small organisations where half of the
total workforce are employed.'
A government review aimed at cutting red tape is under way, with health and
safety one of the areas under scrutiny. The executive is probably stressing
the positive side of the research results because it wishes to highlight the
benefits to businesses of complying with health and safety regulations,
while minimising the bureaucratic burdens involved.
The regulations, which took effect in October 1989, are described by the
executive as 'one of the most significant pieces of health and safety
legislation since the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974'. They cover all
potentially dangerous substances from typewriter correction fluid to farm
pesticides.
All employers are supposed to produce an assessment of potential hazards and
take appropriate action to protect and monitor the health of their
employees.
The research shows that 22 per cent of employers 'needed to make more effort
to comply with Coshh'. A further 6 per cent 'had made little or no attempt'
to meet the requirements of the regulations.
The executive added that some companies had gone 'over the top' in complying
with the regulations - 11 per cent had carried out assessments that went
beyond what was required by law. Those assessments which had been prepared
by employers without outside help were rated as highly as those prepared by
consultants.

FT  14 JUL 93 / Unions in Swans sale initiative
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNION LEADERS at Swan Hunter, the Tyneside shipbuilder in receivership,
wrote yesterday to eight companies they believe may be interested in buying
the yard, pledging the workforce's commitment to its survival and
prosperity.
The letter from the Confederation of Shipbuilding and Engineering Unions
emphasises its desire to retain shipbuilding on the Tyne and stresses that
Swans' workforce has been 'in the vanguard of industrial relations change',
embracing flexibility in working practices.
The initiative reflects union concern at mounting job losses and continuing
uncertainty about the yard's future after two months in receivership.
Mr Eddie Darke of the Life for Swans campaign said: 'We've been very patient
for two months. We decided we had to be a bit more pro-active.' The unions,
he said, also wanted to discourage anybody who did not want to continue
shipbuilding at Swans.
Receivers Price Waterhouse are unhappy about the timing of the letter amid
delicate negotiations with four prospective buyers. PW confirmed yesterday
that no bid had yet been received.
The recipients of the letter are AMEC, which owns large offshore fabrication
facilities on the Tyne; German-based shipbuilder Bremer Vulkan; British
Aerospace; GEC, owner of the Clyde warship builder Yarrow; Norwegian-owned
Kvaerner, owner of the Govan yard on the Clyde; Rolls Royce;
Southampton-based shipbuilder Vosper Thornycroft; and VSEL, the submarine
builder based at Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria.
Unions believe the eight have been in touch with PW since Swans went into
receivership.
Yesterday Rolls Royce and British Aerospace strongly denied any interest in
buying Swan Hunter, and Mr Martin Jay, managing director of Vosper
Thornycroft, said his company had spare capacity at its Southampton and
Portsmouth yards.
Mr Diderik Schnitler, executive vice-president of Kvaerner, indicated that
his company, one of the world's largest shipbuilders, would be unlikely to
bid.
Amec, GEC and VSEL all refused to comment. Mr Friedrich Hennemann, chief
executive of Bremer Vulkan, said in a BBC television interview his company
might be interested.

FT  14 JUL 93 / Caledonian seeks privatised mines stake
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CALEDONIAN MINING, a Nottinghamshire mining equipment manufacturer, is
seeking to become a significant shareholder in a privatised British coal
industry, providing the business is sold off as a single entity.
The privately owned company, which has an annual turnover of about Pounds
30m, has told the government that it wants to own a significant part of the
51 per cent of British Coal that it hopes the government will sell in the
first tranche of privatisation.
Although Caledonian is a relatively small company, its bid is significant
because it is among the first to express faith in a privately owned British
coal industry. The government plans to privatise the industry within two
years and hopes to bring a bill before parliament in the autumn.
Mr Colin MacLeod, Caledonian chairman, said the company had the backing of
its bankers for a bid if the government agreed to its pro-posals.
Caledonian's bid is likely to be strongly opposed by unions and some
managers who want to bid for British Coal themselves.
Caledonian says in a submission to ministers that it would welcome employee
participation through share ownership.
But it would expect to negotiate no-strike agreements and modern working
practices.
The company agrees with management and unions that British Coal should not
be broken up.
'It is doubtful if a coal industry could survive if it was split into a
number of comparatively small units all competing in a market place
dominated by two principal customers,' it says.
It adds that coal producers would be played off against each other in the
need to generate sales, and urges an 'orderly' rundown of electricity
generators' coal stocks.
Mr MacLeod said yesterday that his company would not be bidding for
individual mines sold by British Coal in the approach to full privatisation.
In the longer term, however, it would be interested in mines such as
Easington in Durham and Wearmouth in Tyne and Wear, which are being closed
by British Coal.

FT  14 JUL 93 / Standards institute defends quality management benchmark
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BRITISH Standards Institute yesterday attacked critics of BS5750, its
controversial quality management standard, and defended its role as a writer
of British standards.
Mr Vivian Thomas, BSI chairman, said BS5750 was 'a national asset which BSI
designed and exported round the world and which has been adopted by more
than 20,000 companies in the UK'.
Companies which register for BS5750 are required to formalise internal
management systems so that a consistent quality is maintained. It has
nothing to do with the quality of the product or service and has been
criticised by small businesses in particular as being costly and
bureaucratic.
Mr Thomas said yesterday, at the first of a series of presentations intended
to explain the role of BSI, that the BS5750 standard allowed companies to
reduce waste, increase productivity and obtain a competitive advantage.
'I want to clear the air because there are a lot of misconceptions about BSI
and its terms of reference,' said Mr Thomas. BSI, government subsidies for
standards writing and the quality of British standards are being reviewed by
the Department of Trade and Industry.
As part of its response to criticism of BS5750 BSI issued a policy statement
which it said was intended to correct misconceptions about the standard.
Organisations certifying compliance with BS5750 must ensure that companies
do not misuse their certificates to suggest their products or services have
been assessed, it said.

FT  14 JUL 93 / Private funds sought for rail project
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government announced yesterday that another in a long line of badly
needed transport projects was to be funded and carried out by the private
sector.
It has appointed Hambros Bank, the merchant bank, to develop a plan
involving the private sector in the Pounds 300m resignalling of the London
Euston to Glasgow line, one of the busiest InterCity routes.
The move comes amid growing criticism of the government's progress in its
attempts to involve private-sector finance in public-sector infrastructure
projects.
Some private companies and critics in government spending departments say
the private- sector initiative has become an excuse for delaying projects
such as the Pounds 2.5bn Channel tunnel rail link and the Pounds 2bn
CrossRail scheme for London's east-west rail link.
Mr Roger Freeman, transport minister, yesterday sought to counter scepticism
by emphasising the London-Glasgow line modernisation marked a new approach
by the government in its attempts to involve private sector funding.
He said the government had previously invited the private sector to put
forward proposals which had then been considered on their merits. But now,
he said, the government was taking the initiative.
Hambros has been given until September to develop the funding proposal.
Provided the package was acceptable to the private sector and the Treasury
it will form the basis for tendering between private-sector contractors for
the signalling project.
Last month Eurorail, a consortium involving GEC, Trafalgar House and Balfour
Beatty, said it wanted to become involved in rail projects such as the
upgrading of the London-Glasgow line.
Whichever company wins the contract will recover investment by charging
Railtrack, the public-sector body that will own the tracks after
privatisation, a toll for each train using the resignalled line. Mr Freeman
said private-sector finance would enable the resignalling to be carried out
much more quickly than if the state undertook it, with the cost spread over
the lifetime of the investment.
If the formula proves successful, he added, it could be extended to many
other rail projects. If Hambros does not come up with a package acceptable
to the private sector and government, Railtrack would have to find the funds
for investment.

FT  14 JUL 93 / 25% of house sales 'fail before contract exchange'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORE THAN a quarter of house sales collapse before contracts are exchanged,
a study by the Lord Chancellor's Department has found.
The main reasons are problems raised by surveys, mortgage valuations or
changes in personal circumstances.
The report says the average cost of buying or selling a house in England and
Wales represented about 2 per cent of the purchase price, making it the
cheapest in Europe.
It takes just more than six weeks for an average transaction to progress
from initial agreement to exchange of contracts. To complete a purchase
takes two months on average.
Delays in exchanging contracts are mostly due to waiting for mortgage
finance or by last-minute attempts to renegotiate the purchase price.
The study was commissioned under the Citizen's Charter programme to help
'speed up and simplify the process of buying a house'.
The government is investigating two proposals - time limits for local
authority searches, and a national land information system 'so that all the
information currently requiring searches at the Land Registry and in local
authority registers could be obtained from a single computerised source'.

FT  14 JUL 93 / BR pensions 'at risk', say trustees
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government's proposals for the privatisation of British Rail put BR
pensioners at risk because there is no safeguard against a shortfall in
investment income, according to the scheme's trustees and managers.
The board of trustees, which includes representatives of BR management and
staff, will send a letter to pension scheme members later this week urging
them to contact their MPs to express their concerns.
'The trustee company and the management committee consider that the
government's choice is still not as secure as the current BR pension scheme.
It still leaves pensioners unprotected against any future investment
shortfall,' the letter says.
'It places their pensions at risk in the future because, if enacted, it
removes the present, strong protections against any investment shortfall.'
The trustees want a government 'solvency' guarantee to insure against a
sustained period of poor investment returns at a time when the scheme has
few contributing members.
They expressed their concerns in a meeting with Mr John MacGregor, transport
secretary, on June 24. Mr MacGregor indicated that he 'wished to find a
solution acceptable to all sides'. He has asked his advisers to explore
options with BR's actuarial adviser and a further meeting is expected.
The letter follows the government's decision in May to back down from its
earlier, more controversial, proposal to seize a portion of the scheme's
Pounds 8.5bn assets in exchange for a promise to pay scheme members'
pensions and increase them annually in line with inflation.
Following a public outcry over the proposal Mr MacGregor announced that the
government would instead use the assets to create a scheme in which all
current employees may participate as long as they remain in the rail
industry. A portion of those assets are to be set aside to pay the benefits
of present and deferred pensioners.
While the trustees feel the current proposals are much better than the
earlier ones, they leave open the possibility that pensioners' benefits may

The pensions clause in the railways bill is set to be debated again in the

THE number of people referred by police to the Crown Prosecution Service in
England and Wales has fallen and fewer cases are coming to court in spite of
record levels of crime, the CPS annual report said yesterday.
The report said that in 1992-93 police referred 1.5m cases to the CPS -
83,000 fewer than in 1990-91 and 41,000 fewer than 1991-92.

FT  14 JUL 93 / Birmingham told to retender contract
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BIRMINGHAM City Council, England's largest metropolitan authority, has been
ordered by the government to retender its Pounds 250m housing maintenance
contract because of uncompetitive practices.
Mr Tony Baldry, the environment minister, said Birmingham had awarded work
worth Pounds 250m over five years on 12 large contracts to its own direct
labour organisation because it had offered a significant discount on its
submitted prices provided it was given all the work. He said this was
anti-competitive.
The local authority said the bid from its direct labour force was the
cheapest of nine bids by Pounds 1.35m.

FT  14 JUL 93 / Ministers 'prompted' British Coal move
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT prompted British Coal to consider using its pension-fund
surplus rather than public funds to help pay enhanced pensions to staff made
redundant, counsel for the corporation admitted in the High Court yesterday.
The admission was made on the first day of the court hearing to determine
the legality of the corporation's proposed use of its half share of the
fund's Pounds 1bn surplus.
Mr Edward Nugee QC denied that the government had sought to influence
British Coal to use the surplus rather than grants provided by the
Department of Trade and Industry. It had made the initial suggestion of
using the surplus, he said. However, the corporation had relied since then
on its own legal advice, he added.
The legal challenge has been mounted by the pension-fund trustees who argue
that British Coal would be in breach of the fund's rules.
They argue that British Coal should not be released from its obligations to
fund the pensions of redundant workers. The surplus should be used instead
to allow the corporation to take a further pension fund contributions
holiday.
The dispute arose earlier this year when the corporation withheld Pounds
104m - part of Pounds 400m owed to the fund for providing the early and
enhanced pensions - with the intention of paying it instead from its share
of the surplus.
The hearing is expected to last until Friday.

FT  14 JUL 93 / Companies act to split top roles, report shows
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCY KELLAWAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH companies are bowing to pressure from shareholders and their peers
to split the roles of chairman and chief executive.
According to a survey of companies published yesterday by Korn/Ferry, the
headhunting firm, only 15 per cent still combine the two roles, compared
with 25 per cent a year ago. The division of the two functions was one of
the most important recommendations in the recent Cadbury report on corporate
governance, which said that so much power should not be vested in a single
individual.
Mr Howard Davies, director-general of the Confederation of British Industry,
said yesterday: 'The Cadbury report has reached parts that other
recommendations on corporate governances haven't reached.' He said the scale
of the shift was remarkable for a single year.
The report, which takes a detailed look at the structure, pay and concerns
of British boards, is likely to add to public concern that some directors
are paying themselves too much. It shows that the largest pay rises last
year went to those who were already most handsomely rewarded.
The upper quartile - those earning more than Pounds 360,000 in companies
with turnovers of more than Pounds 1bn and more than Pounds 250,000 in
companies with turnovers of more than Pounds 250m - on average received pay
increases last year of 16 per cent. The bottom quartile received no
increase.
The range in pay settlements for directors overall was unusually wide, with
one in six taking a pay cut. On average the increases were between 4 per
cent and 8 per cent.
Mr Davies singled out as disappointing figures showing that 5 per cent of
larger companies and 24 per cent of smaller ones did not have an audit
committee, as recommended in the Cadbury report.
He described as 'depressing' the finding that the position of women had not
improved since the survey a year ago. There were only 11 women directors out
of nearly 1,000 directors. Only two were executive directors and both of
those were from smaller companies.
'At the top level there is still a network into which women do not fit,'
said Mr Davies. 'Companies say we do not want token women, we only want
board level, but that argument is self-defeating.'
The composition of boards is also changing. Nearly 80 per cent of larger
listed companies have between six and 11 directors on the board, with the
balance becoming more evenly divided between executive and non-executive
directors.
Mr Michael Brandon, author of the report, said: 'All of these factors
suggest that boards have become more businesslike. There are sure signs that
the City has gone off the cult of the superstar whose decisions go through
largely unchallenged.'

FT  14 JUL 93 / Grant cut 'could damage tourism'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PLANNED reductions in government funding of the English Tourist Board could
cause substantial damage to the industry, a study by management consultants
Coopers &amp; Lybrand claims.
The report, commissioned by the board with the agreement of Mr Peter Brooke,
national heritage secretary, says the proposed funding cuts will damage
accommodation rating schemes and end national marketing campaigns.
They will also prevent the board from setting up an inspection scheme for
activity holiday centres.
The report recommends that the board establish such an inspection scheme,
but warns that it will need additional funds to do so.
The government has said it proposes to cut the board's grant from Pounds
13.9m a year to Pounds 9m by 1995-6. The board was established by a 1969 act
to encourage British people to take holidays in England and to promote the
improvement of tourist facilities.
Without the board, the report says, there would be a deterioration in
facilities, a fall in the number of people taking holidays in England and a
widening of the balance of payments deficit.
According to the board the English domestic tourism market has been stagnant
since 1972. In the same period the number of UK residents taking holidays
abroad has increased 58.5 per cent.
The report says government support for tourism is necessary because the
industry is too diverse and fragmented to establish a single representative
organisation. It estimates that there are more than 220,000 UK tourist
businesses, represented by more than 30 trade organisations.
The report says: 'Many elements of the tourism product, such as natural
scenery and sites, beaches and museums, are common goods for which no price
is charged and which are managed and maintained by the public sector.' Use
of these facilities by tourists raises other issues which should be of
concern to the government, such as congestion and damage to the environment.
It adds that there is no need for extensive government intervention or for
large-scale funding. Coopers &amp; Lybrand recommends that the government grant
to the board should remain at about the current level.
The Scottish tourist industry earned Pounds 1.75bn last year, the same in
real terms as 1991, the Scottish Tourist Board said yesterday. Tourism from
overseas brought in Pounds 530m last year, up from Pounds 489m in 1991.
Spending by Scottish holidaymakers and visitors from the rest of the UK was
static.

FT  14 JUL 93 / North sees domestic sales increase as exports decline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NORTH of England's economy is continuing to pull out of recession, a
survey published yesterday shows. It reported increasing levels of domestic
sales and orders, profitability and investment.
In spite of this the Business Survey North, which covers the second quarter
this year, records a dip in export markets. Export orders fell by a third
and the export sales balance - the number of companies reporting improvement
rather than decline - was slightly down.
The Northern Development Company produces the quarterly report with the Tyne
and Wear and Teesside chambers of commerce. The research, based on responses
from 795 companies in north-east England and Cumbria, shows a tripling in
the positive balance on domestic sales.
The balance was the highest for more than three years, with 47.1 per cent of
companies reporting domestic sales up from the previous three months,
compared with 22.4 per cent reporting a fall. The first-quarter figures were
39.5 per cent and 31.4 per cent respectively.
Domestic orders also rose sharply, recording the best performance since the
survey started in 1990. The positive balance for service companies doubled
and half the manufacturers reported higher orders, giving a positive balance
of 27.
Company profits, very depressed since the middle of last year, showed their
highest positive balance for nearly three years, although expectations of
higher profits in the next 12 months barely rose. Prospects for turnover
growth in the coming year were the brightest for three years, with a
positive balance of 47. Manufacturers were more optimistic than service
companies.

FT  14 JUL 93 / Councils may try new governing structures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LOCAL AUTHORITIES in England are to be allowed to experiment with different
models of government and to grant councillors greater allowances to do it,
Mr John Gummer, the environment secretary, announced yesterday.
The proposals come from a joint working party involving representatives of
all the local authority associations, the government and aca - demics.
Councils have been deliberately left without a fixed model and instead have
been invited to experiment with different structures. The proposals include:
Replacing the existing committee structure with a more 'executive' mode of
government.
Creating deliberative committees drawn only from the ruling party, or ruling
coalition.
Further decentralisation of decision-taking.
New rights of review and scrutiny of decisions for councillors.
Enhanced roles for councillors outside the executive.
The proposals are intended to allow 'backbench' councillors a scrutiny role
similar to that of parliamentary select committees. Proposals for directly
elected mayors, mooted by Mr Michael Heseltine when he launched the review
as environment secretary in 1991, have been removed from the agenda.
The allowances system will be amended so that central government lays down
only a basic minimum. Mr Gummer said that this would attract more people to
seek election and allow broader accountability.
The leaders of all the local gov-ernment associations - the
Labour-controlled Association of County Councils and the Association of
Metropolitan Authorities, and the Conservative-controlled Association of
District Councils - welcomed the proposals.
They were addressed by Mr Gummer at a conference on the plans at
Westminster, and in a joint statement said: 'The report offers a loose
framework within which new approaches can be tried out, and is a welcome
alternative to government enforcement of change.
'The recognition that allowances to members need to be improved, with more
discretion for authorities, is long overdue.'
But Mr Gummer received a hostile reception at the conference when answering
councillors' questions.
Responding to questions about the removal of schools from local education
authority control, he said: 'I'm fed up with local authorities who talk
about 'our schools'. I think it should be local people making decisions.
'If I'm going to fight for subsidiarity for local government it won't be
helped by people who say they want to get their hands back on things which
can run themselves.'

FT  14 JUL 93 / Output rises across industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   THE sharp 1.8 per cent rise in manufacturing output in May
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
and a 2.1 per cent increase in the last three months - was widely spread
across industry.
Output fell only in the food, drink and tobacco industry, but this was
mainly because of abnormally high sugar output in February, which distorted
the three-month on three-month comparison.
Growth was particularly strong in the engineering industries, which account
for more than 40 per cent of manufacturing output.
Car and car parts production increased by 7.9 per cent in the latest three
months compared with the previous quarter, while strong computer output
fuelled a 2.5 per cent rise in electrical and instrument engineering.
The milder winter was behind a strong rise in building materials output.
This prompted a 6.1 per cent increase in output of minerals and mineral
products in the three months to May compared with the previous three months.
A 1.9 per cent rise in output of the chemicals and man-made fibres sector
stemmed from a strong performance by the pharmaceuticals industry.
Output of total production industries - manufacturing plus energy output -
rose only 0.4 per cent in the latest three months because of a fall in
energy and water pro-duction.
Output of coal and coke fell 9 per cent.

FT  14 JUL 93 / N Sea tax changes set for gas review
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE IMPACT on gas pipelines of changes in the North Sea tax regime announced
in the March Budget is to be reviewed by the government, Mr Stephen Dorrell,
financial secretary to the Treasury, said last night.
Hinting at another possible concession over the Treasury's controversial
amendments to the petroleum revenue tax regime, Mr Dorrell said that he had
'agreed to look again' at a particular anomaly raised by Tory MPs.
However Mr Dorrell described the area that would be reviewed as 'narrow' and
said the government would not bend on the main parts of the changes which
were announced in March.
Speaking during the final Commons stage of the Finance Bill, which
introduces changes announced in the Budget, Mr Dorrell said North Sea
exploration would be undermined if the government was believed to be about
to re-open the debate about PRT.
The problem over pipelines had been raised by Mr Alan Duncan, Conservative
MP for Rutland and Melton.
He expressed concern that existing pipelines built with excess capacity,
with a view to that capacity being used at a later date, would be unfairly
disadvantaged compared with new pipelines.
The existing pipeline could be subject to PRT but not the competing new
pipelines.
Last month the government bowed to pressure from Conservative MPs and
extended the short-term help for companies worst hit by the PRT changes.

FT  14 JUL 93 / Water debate flows into government's domain: Dispute is
raging over who should foot the bill for rising costs in meeting European
directives on quality
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR IAN Byatt, the water regulator, has thrust the issue of rising water
bills firmly into the government's lap. In essence his discussion paper
published yesterday says the cost of cleaning up Britain's water has become
unacceptable, and it is up to the government to reduce it by renegotiating
or relaxing water quality standards.
He has deliberately stirred up what is likely to be a fierce debate about
how much Britons are prepared to pay for pure water and clean rivers and
beaches.
The price row has been brewing ever since the UK embarked on its clean-up
programme in the 1980s and privatised the water industry in England and
Wales.
A year ago Mr Byatt produced his first paper on the subject, The Cost of
Quality in which he laid out various scenarios for the water clean-up. A
typical household paying Pounds 185 a year for water in 1994-95 could be
paying Pounds 245 to Pounds 345 a year by 2004-05 depending on how fast the
clean-up was done, he said.
His paper infuriated water quality regulators, particularly the National
Rivers Authority which accused him of exaggerating the problem and providing
misleading analyses of the issues. Environmentalists also attacked him for
trying to undermine quality standards and ignoring consumers demands for
high-class water and sewage systems. There were even suggestions that Mr
Byatt, who sets controls for water prices, was trying to duck his
responsibilities.
The timing of this paper, Paying For Quality, is particularly sensitive
because he has to decide on the next set of five-yearly controls by next
summer. The pricing formula makes a special allowance for water companies to
pass on the cost of service and he is therefore in a position to sanction
large price increases.
The water industry, usually on the receiving end of complaints about rising
water costs, this time supports what it sees as Mr Byatt's efforts to strike
a balance between benefits and costs. Ms Janet Langdon, the director of the
Water Services Association, said: 'The industry wants stability.'
Mr Byatt makes two points in reinforcing his case for a softer approach. One
is that considerable improvements are already being made, so it is a
question of slowing the rate of improvement rather than reducing standards.
Water companies are already spending Pounds 3.5bn a year, but full
implementation of the regulations, particularly the European Community's
Urban Waste Water Directive, would increase that to Pounds 5bn.
The second is that customers have not been given the chance to say whether
they are prepared to bear the soaring costs.
When Britain signed up for the waste water directive the cost of
implementation was put at Pounds 2bn. It is now thought to be Pounds 10bn.
'I don't believe that increases of that kind are what people want or what
they are prepared to pay for,' he says.
Mr Byatt received support for that view yesterday from Mr Jim Gardner,
chairman of the Ofwat National Consumer Council. 'It's too much too
quickly,' he said. But Friends of the Earth, the environmental pressure
group, has accused him of again trying to postpone improvements.
One factor in this debate is whether customers should bear all the costs of
improvements. Through price controls Mr Byatt can limit the costs passed on,
in which case water company profits would suffer and shareholders would bear
some of the cost.
But Mr Byatt also has a statutory duty to ensure water companies can finance
capital investments - if he squeezes prices too tight the companies could
exercise their right to complain to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
The government will be watching the debate closely. Ministers are sensitive
to the furore about water bills, but the shape of public opinion is far from
clear cut. All 10 regional water companies in England and Wales have
conducted a survey of their customers to enable Mr Byatt to assess whether
they are prepared to pay more for quality. Three of them, Anglian, Wessex
and Southern, have received the answer yes.
But even if a consensus emerges for holding down costs the government will
have to weigh the wider implications of seeking to renegotiate the EC
directives. Mr Byatt, who is urging them to do just that, says the UK is not
the only country with these concerns. 'I sense an increasing interest in
costs in other parts of Europe,' he says.
Mr Tim Yeo, the environment minister, said yesterday he wanted to see
'whether other countries are coming to the same conclusion.'

FT  14 JUL 93 / Revenue ruling on bank is reversed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMMERZBANK, one of Germany's largest banks, has won a long-running legal
dispute with the UK's tax authorities.
The European Court of Justice ruled yesterday that efforts by the Inland
Revenue to hold back about Pounds 5m in compensation for interest built up
on incorrectly assessed tax were contrary to the Treaty of Rome.
Mr Stephen Kon, partner of SJ Berwin, the UK solicitors which represented
Commerzbank, said the case had 'important implications' for tax legislation
in the UK and other EC countries.
Commerzbank successfully contested a UK tax assessment in 1990. But the
Inland Revenue refused a repayment of interest that would have been earned
on the wrongly assessed payments on the grounds that the bank operated
through a branch office and was not resident in the UK.
The High Court referred the case to the European Court of Justice after the
bank challenged the decision.
Mr Kon said that the judgment 'creates considerable scope for dealing with
discriminatory provisions of this nature both in the UK and other EC
domestic law, and a good deal of litigation may well follow'.
He pointed to other UK tax reliefs in UK law which are not available to
non-residents, including relief on low earnings for corporation tax for
small companies and relief on interest deducted on payments to non-resident
lenders. Mr Kon said similar anomalies arose in 'legislation in other EC
countries, all of which will now be subject to challenge'.
The Inland Revenue said that it would write to companies which it believed
would be affected by the decision and make the necessary repayments.
It added: 'We will give some publicity to the case so that everybody is
aware of the change.'
The European Court ruling followed a preliminary ruling by the
advocate-general in March. It says: 'Articles 52 and 58 of the Treaty of
Rome prevent the legislation of a member state from granting repayment
supplement on overpaid tax to companies which are resident for tax purposes
in that state, whilst refusing the supplement to companies resident for tax
purposes in another member state.
'The fact that the latter would not have been exempt from tax if they had
been resident in that state is of no relevance.'

FT  14 JUL 93 / Surge in early teacher retirements
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THE NUMBER of teachers in England and Wales retiring early through ill
health each year has almost tripled since 1979, Teachers' Pension Agency
figures released today by the National Association of Head Teachers show.
The association blamed government reforms and increasing workloads. Mr David
Hart, general secretary, said: 'Teachers are leaving early because they are
suffering from stress-related illnesses, or because they are being made
redundant.'
The pace of reform and the strain on school budgets was taking far too heavy
a toll of 'experienced staff that schools could ill-afford to lose', he
said.
The pension agency, was said the number of early retirements through ill
health had risen from 1,617 to 4,775 since the educational year of 1979-80,
although the population's health had improved.
The numbers made redundant before 60 rose from 2,295 to 10,293. The
association said budget problems led to the employment of younger, 'cheaper'
teachers at the expense of older, more experienced staff.
Mrs Ann Taylor, shadow education secretary, said the statistics provided 'an
alarming confirmation of what we all know from personal experience'.
She added: 'Some of our most conscientious teachers are leaving education
and the confrontational government's failure to listen to the concerns of
parents, governors and teachers only makes matters worse.'

<TEXT>
THE US and Mexico will seek to raise Dollars 15bn-Dollars 20bn from the
private sector for investment in roads, housing, energy generation,
construction and environmental projects along their 2,000-mile border, Mr
Ron Brown, the US commerce secretary, said yesterday, Nancy Dunne reports
from Washington.
Five members of each country's cabinet are to sell the border's economic
future, at a conference at San Antonio, Texas, tomorrow and Friday.
The idea is 'to do deals' at a meeting of public officials, investment
bankers and engineering and construction companies, and this came from Mr
Brown.
He then quickly won the enthusiastic backing of his Mexican counterpart, Mr
Luis Donaldo Colosio Murrieta.
'Too many people have looked on these infrastructure efforts as a drain on
tax revenue,' said Mr Brown. 'We're trying to demonstrate that it is the
private sector we are looking to, that these are projects which make sense
and ought to be able to generate financing.'
Mr Brown, a successful former chairman of the Democratic party in the US, is
now pushing the old Republican party notion of 'a public-private
partnership'.
This a particularly attractive to the two countries' cash-strapped
governments, looking for ways to create jobs, and to a private sector with
much to gain from the investments.

FT  14 JUL 93 / World Trade News: Eastward with success in glass - Trade
across Europe / Ronald van de Krol visits a Philips factory venture in
Poland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RONALD VAN DE KROL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE easiest way to measure the transformation of Poland's biggest lighting
company is to look for broken glass - or a lack of it - at its production
site.
Before Philips of the Netherlands took a majority stake in Polam-Pila, in
1991, the company had to produce 170 glass tubes to end up with 100
fluorescent lights.
This was because so many glass tubes broke, cracked or ended up faulty. The
tell-tale signs of inefficiency were the shards of glass littering the
factory floor.
Now - after investments in a new glass furnace, intensive training of staff
and the advent of stringent quality control - Philips Lighting Poland, the
new Polam-Pila, needs to produce just 112 tubes for every 100 effective
fluorescent lights. This ratio compares well with the 108:100 achieved by
Philips factories in such places as the Dutch town of Roosendal.
Showing off his new, computer-driven quality-control system, Mr Stanislaw
Kozlowski, the 42-year-old general manager, says: 'Before, we had four
grades of quality that we checked for. Now we accept only one type of
quality - the best.'
The sharp improvement, achieved by a 3.5-fold increase in annual investment
to Fl 21.8m (Pounds 7.6m) means that the company, at Pila in north-western
Poland, is now allowed to export some of its products to the Philips sales
organisation in the Netherlands.
This effectively puts a small portion of its production on a par with that
of the 11 other lighting plants maintained by Philips in western Europe.
Still, the Polish company has a long way to go, despite turning in a small
profit for 1992 after running up a loss in 1991.
The contrast between the new and the old is vividly highlighted by Building
61A - a showcase of new Philips-built equipment - and Building 48, described
by one manager as an 'industrial archaeological museum.'
Indeed, inside the hall, pride of place is reserved for two machines dating
from the 1920s. These were confiscated from the old Philips factory in
Warsaw, after nationalisation in 1948, and are no longer in service. The
rest of the machines in the hall are virtually carbon copies of this
original, outdated, machinery.
For Philips, Polam-Pila is an important step in its plans for eastern
Europe, giving it a strong foothold in the region's biggest market and
access to a company with a proven record in exports.
In 1992, exports accounted for nearly 60 per cent of sales of Dollars 55m
(Pounds 37m). Most of these were to store chains in North America and
Britain, which sold the lamps under their own labels.
Russian exports, hit by turmoil in the former Soviet Union, have started to
recover, now that sales are denominated in dollars and linked in a complex
counter-trade arrangement to Polish imports of Russian oil.
The Polish investment is important because it marks a departure from the
normal Philips practice. Instead of stationing a team of expatriate managers
in Poland, the Dutch company chose at the outset to work with local
management under Mr Kozlowski, whose 80-hour week is testimony to the
challenge of switching from a command economy to a free market.
In many ways, the success of Polam-Pila under Philips is an extension of its
impressive achievements under the constraints of communism. The company used
to be bound to follow ministerial edicts from Warsaw, but it was allowed to
start exporting to the west in the 1970s and to expose itself to the rigours
of self-financing in the 1980s.
'In spite of adverse conditions, they had developed according to their own
philosophy, they were motivated and they were serious,' according to Mr
Einar Kloster, president of the Philips lighting division.
Mr Rene van Reeth, a divisional director and key adviser to the Polish team,
says: 'This use of local management is something we may want to try
elsewhere.' Philips, which has light bulb factories from Nigeria to
Indonesia, is keen to expand.
Its eyes are firmly set on China.
Its efforts in Poland are frequently contrasted with the acquisition of
Hungary's Tungsram lighting group by General Electric of the US.
The US company has made intensive use of expatriates and of
Hungarian-American managers, and job losses have been heavy.
A direct comparison, however, is difficult because Tungsram is four times
larger than Polam-Pila, and has six production sites instead of one.
Even so, only 500 out of 3,500 jobs have been lost in Pila, underlining the
fact that the Polish factory had never known the over-staffing common under
the former, communist system.
The labour force in Poland has had to adjust to new circumstances. Early
expectations of western wages were dashed by a temporary freezing of
salaries, causing some short-term labour unrest which has since abated.
Also, the Polish management put a halt to the old practice of paying people
according to the number of light bulbs produced, regardless of quality.
'Over a year, we gradually abandoned paying people on the quantity of their
output,' Mr Kozlowski says. 'Payment is now on the basis of a monthly
salary, with the possibility of a small bonus to keep quality discipline.'

<TEXT>
BULGARIA is looking for foreign investors and partners to build its share of
two new bridges across the River Danube, officials said yesterday, Reuter
reports from Sofia.
Bulgaria and Romania plan to build the bridges across their Danube frontier
to ease a heavily congested route that links central Europe, several former
Soviet republics and the Middle East.
'We are inviting foreign bids for the construction of the bridges,' said Mr
Matey Donchev, technical director of Bulgaria's Danube bridges directorate.
Neither country had the money to construct the bridges and would have to
rely on investment from abroad.
Officials have estimated the cost of each bridge at Dollars 120m (Pounds
81m). They would be built over the next four years and customs posts will be
combined to save time.
Mr Donchev said Mitsubishi from Japan had shown interest in the project, as
had other companies from South Africa, Turkey and Austria.
Only one bridge links Bulgaria and Romania at present and it is severely
congested because of diverted traffic from the former Yugoslavia, wracked by
civil war.
It is planned that one road and rail bridge will link the Bulgarian river
port of Vidin with the Romanian town of Calafat, and the other will connect
Oryahovo on the Bulgarian side with and the Romanian town of Beket.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FIVE British companies, among them British Gas, Rolls-Royce and British
Steel, are discussing possible participation in the trans-Andean gas
pipeline with a Chilean consortium.
The project, expected to cost Dollars 1.2bn-Dollars 2bn, will carry gas from
southern Argentina to Chile's capital, Santiago, a distance of 1,200km.
UK company executives visited Chile recently as part of a delegation led by
Mr Michael Portillo, Britain's chief secretary to the Treasury. They
discussed participating in transmission and distribution work with Chilectra
and ENAP, which hold the gas supply contract.
The project has a target completion date of late 1996.
Mr Portillo said the broader aim of his trip was to raise Chile's profile
among UK businesses. Although Britain had historically been a big investor
in the country, it had been slow to exploit recent opportunities outside the
mining sector.
Chile's economy, though relatively small, is one of the fastest growing in
Latin America. Its exports are equally divided between Europe, Asia and the
Americas.
Mr Portillo, who said ministers had assured him of the country's commitment
to free trade, is keen to speed up two bilateral trade deals: a double
taxation accord and an investment promotion and protection agreement. After
talks with Chile's foreign minister, Mr Enrique Silva, he expressed
confidence that the taxation accord would be signed 'before the end of the
year'.

<TEXT>
GEC-ALSTHOM, the Anglo-French supplier of electricity generation equipment,
has gained support in the Indonesian parliament, in the bitter fight to win
contracts for two 300MW power stations.
Mr Erie Soekardja, deputy chairman of the Indonesian parliamentary energy
commission, has called on the government to explain why a rival bid has been
favoured, even though it is significantly higher than that tendered by
GEC-Alsthom.
PLN, the country's state-owned electricity company, recommended last May
that the German operation of ABB, the Swiss-Swedish group, and Mitsubishi of
Japan should build the gas-powered stations, at Muara Tawar in West Java and
Pasuruan in East Java.
Some Dollars 23bn of investment in new capacity for the power network is
planned in the period 1994 to 1999, and, according to one industry official,
the companies 'are playing rough and ready business politics' to win a share
of it.
Antara, the state-owned news agency, says GEC-Alsthom has written to
Indonesian President Suharto, setting out its bid of Dollars 500 per
kilowatt, valuing the stations at Dollars 150m each, and a commitment to
complete them by September of next year.
The bid by ABB and Mitsubishi, it claims, represented Dollars 623 per
kilowatt, valuing the plants at Dollars 187m each, and offered completion by
March, 1995.
PLN says that its recommendation was based on the proven track record of ABB
and Mitsubishi in Indonesia.
Industry officials also suggest that technical variations in the proposals
could account for the cost difference.

FT  14 JUL 93 / World Trade News: Import prices 'often higher' than US steel
 -ITC staff report will bear on dumping decisions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE PRICE of steel imported into the US is often higher than the steel sold
by the American mills which are accusing their foreign competitors of
widespread dumping, according to a report produced by the staff of the
International Trade Commission.
The ITC's staff report forms part of the record for the agency's six
commissioners when they weigh their decisions on 72 flat-rolled dumping and
subsidy steel cases now moving towards conclusion. Injury findings in the
controversial cases are due on July 27.
'Imports generally cost twice as much as domestic steel,' said a senior ITC
staff member, who asked not to be identified. Often the foreign products are
of higher quality, or capable of special use, and price is not a factor.
In fact, high-quality imports often cost so much more that a lawyer
defending South Korea before the ITC introduced commissioners to a 'dummy
theory' - arguing that US steel customers had to be 'dummies' if they are
buying from abroad a product they can get domestically and paying more.
The prices charged for steel imports could be the key to the 72 cases
against foreign companies, which are accused of depressing US prices. About
Dollars 3.2bn (Pounds 2.2bn) in preliminary tariffs have been levied against
them, but the duties would be lifted if the ITC fails to find that imports
are the cause of the US industry's troubles.
A survey conducted by the non-partisan ITC staff found that price is rarely
an issue when US manufacturers purchase foreign steel products. More often,
the steel is purchased for reasons of quality, reliable supply or superior
technical support - the reasons they buy from Americans.
According to the survey, users also buy from domestic sources because of
shorter lead times between orders and delivery, because of 'Buy American'
policies, and of scope for placing smaller minimum orders.
Several purchasers said they would not buy any foreign steel if comparable
domestic products were available at lower prices; others said they bought
imports because a comparable product was not available from domestic mills.
The staff also found that foreign companies as a whole had increased market
penetration for hot-rolled steel. The share steadily increased from 13.2 per
cent in 1990 to 15.3 per cent in 1992. However, the increases were captured
by Canada, South Korea and the Netherlands, while other countries' shares
were constant or declined.
Lawyers representing foreign producers were pleased with the staff report,
but say the ITC commissioners are unpredictable and sometimes biased towards
the domestic industry.
The senior ITC staffer confirmed that impression. 'A minority of
commissioners vote on the merits of the individual cases,' he said. 'We look
at the decisions. . . and they're from Mars.'
Mr Jim Bovard, an expert on the 'unfair trade' laws, said the commission
could look at the higher prices and rule the defendants guilty of 'quality
dumping' - meaning that the price difference is less than the quality
difference, and the foreign steelmaker should charge more even if prices are
higher.
'The decisions are often written by the commissioners' staffers,' he said.
'They are political animals.'
Meanwhile, US steel users have organised to lobby against the industry's
effort. They say the higher prices resulting from the tariffs will make
their products uncompetitive on export markets.
The Coalition of American Businesses for Stable Steel Supplies said the high
tariffs hurts small business which is expected to generate most of the
country's new job.
'Supply instability and higher prices will reduce the competitiveness of
literally thousands of American companies that employ perhaps up to 8m
American workers,' the group said.

FT  14 JUL 93 / Japanese Elections: Takeshita forced on to the stump - But
former prime minister is still the local hero
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'LOOK, THERE he goes]' squeal women supporters as Mr Noboru Takeshita,
former Japanese prime minister, climbs into his black chauffeur-driven
Toyota surrounded by his 10 special police guards.
While Mr Takeshita has faced heavy public criticism for his alleged links to
gangsters and a more recent corruption scandal involving a gold leaf screen,
back in Shimane prefecture, his local constituency in western Japan, he is
still a hero.
'I know he'll get in,' says Mr Yutaka Adachi, who proudly says he is the
same age as Mr Takeshita - 69.
Shimane is a typical rural constituency. The sparsely populated region is
represented by five MPs in the lower house, the same as a crowded urban
district. For as long as people can remember, four out of the five seats
have been held by the ruling Liberal Democratic party, and the benefits are
brazenly apparent. The prefecture has the highest annual public works
spending per capita.
However, the political upheaval triggered by the no-confidence vote which
brought down the government of Mr Kiichi Miyazawa has also reached this
traditionally conservative region. Mr Atsushi Nishikori, a 42-year-old
candidate, is running for the New Harbinger Party, a splinter group from the
LDP.
Mr Takeshita, running as an independent because of LDP worries that his
tarnished image would hurt the party, is facing one of the toughest election
campaigns in his 35-year political career. He has been forced to run an
unusually thorough campaign, holding meetings with his electorate for the
first time in 24 years.
He is aware of the opinion polls, where about 70 per cent of Japanese wanted
Mr Takeshita's resignation, and is copying the exhaustive campaign tactics
of his political mentor Mr Kakuei Tanaka, after he was indicted over a
financial scandal in the 1970s.
For the past week, Mr Takeshita has been driving through more than 20 towns
and villages a day, speaking to groups of 30 to 60 supporters.
Mr Takeshita looks relaxed, speaking in his hometown Shimane dialect, but he
also feels the need to justify his past actions and blame the scandals on
the media. He defends himself against claims that he had used gangster links
to silence an extreme right-wing group which had mounted a 'praise to death'
campaign against him in 1987 before his elevation to the premiership.
'I couldn't sue the Kominto (the right-wing group) because they were
praising me,' he says in front of an audience of 30 in a hall in Hakuta, a
village in the mountains.
He also tells supporters that the scandal surrounding the sale of a gold
leaf screen, the sale proceeds of which were allegedly given to politicians,
including a secretary to Mr Takeshita, was 'made up by the media.'
After apologising for the 'great sorrow caused among his friends back home,'
he clenches his fist, claiming he has a mission to find the truth behind the
scandal.
Supporters listen intently to Mr Takeshita's recollections of the six summit
meetings of the Group of Seven leading industrial nations he attended as
finance minister or prime minister.
'I have many friends abroad,' he says, stressing his role as an elder
statesman. Mr Takeshita expresses his concern for the environment, implying
that he had proposed the earth summit in Rio last year.
He does not fail to add his support to political reform. 'It's the sign of
the times and I'd like to contribute what I can through my experience as a
politician,' he says.
After the 20-minute speech, Mr Takeshita leaves the modern village hall in
the middle of the rice paddies.
'It's the media's fault that the LDP is having such a hard time,' says
supporter Mr Adachi.
With the help of Mr Shin Kanemaru, the disgraced former kingmaker of the
LDP, Mr Takeshita led the largest faction within the party, but was forced
to resign as prime minister in 1989 due to his involvement in the Recruit
stock-for-favours scandal.
However, even after Recruit, thanks to the vast supporter network and
corporate votes from local construction companies, he managed to win the
most votes in the prefecture.
Elsewhere in the region, Mr Yoshio Sakurauchi, the 81-year-old former
speaker of the lower house, who has represented Shimane for more than 40
years, calls through the loudspeakers for support. Although his age limits
his campaigning to waving through the rice paddies from his van, and brief
speeches in front of small local train stations, supporters rush out of
their houses to cheer him on.
Such deep-rooted support for the LDP has prevented NHP's Mr Nishikori from
overtly criticising Mr Takeshita, although to many Japanese he is a symbol
of political corruption.
Mr Toshio Harada, head of Mr Nishikori's support group, says that some
Shimane voters have come to realise that the prefecture is now the centre of
the nation's attention.
While national criticism of the old ways of Japanese politicking has
heightened during the last few days of the election campaign, most Shimane
voters expect Mr Takeshita to be elected. 'He still has very strong links
with construction groups, who will give him the organised vote,' says Mr
Kiyomi Osawa, a middle-aged office worker.
However that is not the only reason he is likely to be re-elected. 'I don't
care what the media says, Mr Takeshita is good for Shimane,' says a farmer,
gazing at a newly road stretching towards the mountains.

Western donors yesterday pledged to give Tanzania up to Dollars 1.2bn in aid
but criticised the country for not overhauling its economy fast enough,
Reuter reports from Paris.
After a two-day meeting, donors warned Tanzania that it would have to do
better because it was competing for aid with many other countries.
'Delegates . . . expressed widespread concern that the pace of economic
reform was inadequate to put Tanzania on a sustainable growth path rapid
enough to reduce poverty substantially in the medium term,' their statement
said.
The Dollars 1.2bn pledged for Tanzania's fiscal 1993-94 year to end June
1994 includes Dollars 840m of project assistance and Dollars 360m
balance-of-payments support.

Nigeria's Social Democratic party, the apparent victor in an aborted
presidential election last month, has refused to take part in a new poll
sought by the military government, writes Paul Adams in Lagos.
President Ibrahim Babangida withdrew late on Monday his offer to let the SDP
and the rival National Republican Convention form an interim government of
unelected civilians and replace his eight-year regime on August 27.
Yesterday the government said an interim government would have invited
instability. The president used similar reasons to explain annulment of the
June election, in which Mr Moshood Abiola, the SDP candidate, was ahead when
counting was halted.

IRAQ yesterday began to prepare the public for possible US military attacks,
following its refusal to let United Nations weapons inspectors seal off two
missile sites west of Baghdad pending installation of remote-control
cameras, writes our Middle East Staff.
Mr Rolf Ekeus, head of the UN weapons inspection team, flew to Bahrain
yesterday on his way to Baghdad in what is likely to be the final attempt to
persuade Iraq to abide by UN Security Council resolutions.
The Baghdad newspaper al-Qadissiya warned that the US would not hesitate to
strike against Iraq again and said the confrontation over the missile test
sites was a a pretext for attack. Another newspaper, al-Jumhuriya, earlier
accused Mr Ekeus of masterminding a conspiracy to broaden the scope of UN
resolutions.

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DIRECTORS of the International Monetary Fund will review Vietnam's arrears
today in a move that will start the process of bringing the country back
into the international financial community.
The meeting will be the IMF's first discussion of Vietnam since President
Bill Clinton announced that the US would no longer oppose efforts to pay off
the country's arrears.
The US representative on the IMF board is expected today to give a formal
signal on Vietnam to his colleagues, who say they have so far read of Mr
Clinton's intentions only in the press.
This could trigger the formation of a support group headed by France and
possibly Japan to provide bridging finance that would enable Vietnam to
clear its arrears with the IMF, which total around 100m special drawing
rights, the Fund's internal accounting unit.
Agreement on an economic policy programme could follow quickly once the
country has paid off its arrears. This would allow Vietnam to draw up to
SDR120m (Pounds 112.15m) from the IMF under a standby financing agreement.
Once money has started to flow into Vietnam from the IMF and the development
banks, the US government will find it difficult to resist pressures from US
businesses to lift its trade embargo.

FT  14 JUL 93 / Former BCCI officers charged in Abu Dhabi
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THIRTEEN former officers of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International
have been charged in Abu Dhabi two years after the bank was closed following
a multi-billion-pound fraud.
The charges, announced yesterday, mean that Mr Swaleh Naqvi, the bank's
former chief executive officer, could face a 36-year jail sentence if
convicted on all counts.
Mr Naqvi was among several senior officers in Abu Dhabi engaged on
restructuring the bank at the time of its worldwide closure, initiated by
the Bank of England, in July 1991. They have been held in police custody in
the emirate for nearly two years.
Charges have also been made against Mr Agha Hasan Abedi, the bank's founder,
and Mr Zafar Iqbal, another former chief executive of the bank. However, Mr
Abedi, now living in Pakistan, may never be brought to trial as there is no
extradition treaty between the two countries.
The charges include forgery, use of a forged instrument, breach of trust,
irregular allocation of dividends, false entries in company documents and
false entries in accounts. Most of the charges carry a maximum sentence of
three years or a fine, but terms can run consecutively.
The charges are the culmination of an investigation in Abu Dhabi that has
been running almost two years. 'A case of this size and complexity is
unprecedented in the emirates and the prosecutors wanted to prepare the
ground in as much detail as possible before they went ahead,' said an Abu
Dhabi official.
A preliminary hearing has been set for October 9 when the court will decide
whether the accused bankers should continue to be detained in the police
club, as at present, or should be remanded elsewhere. It will also decide
whether a trial should be held in public.
The prosecution has been launched against 10 of the 13 officers who have
been in detention. The three men who were released, Mr Saleem Siddiki, Mr
Nadeem Habibullah and Mr Askari Khan, are on conditional bail and cannot
leave the country as investigations are continuing.
It was not clear last night whether Abu Dhabi would be approaching the UK
about Mr Ziauddin Akbar, the former head of treasury at BCCI, who was among
those charged. He is currently remanded in Britain on charges laid by the
Serious Fraud Office.

KHMER ROUGE guerrillas are willing to join Cambodia's new national army to
try to bring peace to the country, according to Mr Khieu Samphan, the
faction's president, Reuter reports from Phnom Penh.
He also told reporters that Prince Norodom Sihanouk, the head of state, had
offered the Khmer Rouge ministerial posts in the new government. 'We have
proposed to establish a quadripartite army so as to avoid clashes and
confrontation on the military field,' he said after talks with the United
Nations military commander and the deputy peacekeeping chief. 'We see it as
the only way to solve and avoid clashes and confrontation.'
A diplomat warned, however, that the Khmer Rouge may be putting a rosier
glow on its new-found friendship with the government than was warranted. 'It
sounds as though only one concession has come out,' he said.
But he noted with concern that the Maoist group's willingness to join a
united army did not mean it would give up the 15 per cent of Cambodia that
it now controls, or even allow free access to the areas.
Mr Khieu Samphan returned to Phnom Penh yesterday after an absence of three
months and met Prince Norodom Ranariddh, joint leader of the interim
power-sharing government.
Mr Khieu Samphan said the Khmer Rouge sought a role as advisers rather than
cabinet posts.

But he noted with concern that the Maoist group's willingness to join a
united army did not mean it would give up the 15 per cent of Cambodia that
it now controls, or even allow free access to the areas.
The hardline Khmer Rouge fields 10,000 to 15,000 guerrilla fighters.
About 100 of them last Wednesday attacked government troops and overran the
12th century temple they were guarding near the country's northern border
with Thailand.
Mr Khieu Samphan returned to Phnom Penh yesterday after an absence of three
months and went straight into a meeting with Prince Norodom Ranariddh, joint
leader of the interim power-sharing government.
The prince told him that Cambodia's head of state 'has in mind to give us
some ministerial posts,' Mr Khieu Samphan said.
'If that is the case, we will accept with pleasure in the spirit of national
reconciliation.'
He added, however, that the Khmer Rouge sought a role as advisers rather
than cabinet posts.
The US has said it would have difficulty supporting a government that
included the Khmer Rouge.
The 3 1/2 -year Khmer Rouge rule claimed 1m lives until Vietnam invaded in
December 1978 to oust the group and install a sympathetic government, led
until UN-organised elections in May by the then prime minister Hun Sen.
The Khmer Rouge and two non-communist guerrilla allies waged a civil war
against that government until a UN-sponsored peace pact in October 1991 that
led to the elections.
The Khmer Rouge later abandoned the peace agreement. It boycotted the polls
narrowly won by Ranariddh's royalist party, their civil war ally.
The diplomat noted that the guerrilla leader had not met Hun Sen, once his
most bitter foe and now a co-president in the interim government that will
rule until elected representatives can write a new constitution.

<TEXT>
THE United Nations faces a financial crisis of unprecedented dimensions
because member states have not paid peacekeeping bills, notably in the
former Yugoslav republics and Somalia, Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, secretary
general, said yesterday, writes Michael Littlejohns, UN Correspondent, in
New York.
With arrears on regular budget and peacekeeping accounts already exceeding
Dollars 2.3bn, he warned of the high probability that the UN soon would be
unable to meet its day-to-day obligations.
Evidently alluding to the US and Russia, Mr Boutros Ghali said two-thirds of
the amount was owed by permanent members of the Security Council, the UN's
primary peacekeeping authority. By May 31, only 10 member states had paid
peacekeeping assessments in full and only eight had paid their regular dues.
He noted that in only one year in the last 10 had regular budget collections
exceeded assessments and only once had the total outstanding balance been
lower at the end of the year than at its beginning.
As the UN placed more and more troops in the field, peacekeeping assessments
since last September, totalling Dollars 1.7bn (Pounds 1.1bn), exceeded the
entire 1993 regular budget. Calling the outlook 'bleak', Mr Boutros Ghali
said he had already had to meet shortfalls from a newly established
peacekeeping reserve fund, although that was not its purpose. Countries that
provided troops were having to wait for reimbursement. Officials said this
was one reason why the UN was experiencing serious difficulties in
assembling peacekeepers.

FT  14 JUL 93 / Quake overshadows Japanese poll: Miyazawa views damage and
pledges aid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR KIICHI Miyazawa, the Japanese prime minister, yesterday flew in to
Hakodate on the northern island of Hokkaido to survey nearby damage caused
by a strong earthquake and subsequent tidal waves which together claimed 61
lives.
Mr Miyazawa, who arrived after campaigning in Nagoya in central Japan for
Sunday's general election, had earlier reassured the country that the
government would act immediately to assist those affected. Interrupting
saturation media coverage of the national election campaign were pictures of
smouldering towns and television footage of houses adrift in the ocean.
The earthquake off the shore of northern Japan, which registered 7.8 on the
Richter scale, was the largest to hit the country since an earthquake of
similar magnitude off the Sea of Japan 10 years ago.
Tidal waves reaching up to five metres hit Hokkaido as well as the coasts of
10 prefectures in northern Japan, causing extensive damage to local fishing
villages and towns. Tidal waves also reached Russia's far east coast,
leaving a handful of people missing, damaging fishing vessels and an oil
pipeline.
In addition to the 61 people reported dead in Japan, 169 were missing, 550
houses collapsed and 385 houses were under water.
After shocks continued in the region yesterday and the meteorological agency
warned that the danger remained of an after-shock of a magnitude of 6
hitting the region within a month.
On Okushiri island, close to the earthquake's epicentre, houses continued to
burn last night. More than 300 houses caught fire in the Aonae area of
Okushiri alone and a cliff buried a nearby hotel within seconds of
collapsing.
Residents of Okushiri were moved to a local school and 100 Self Defence
Force military personnel were flown in to distribute fresh water and food
and help in the rescue.
The damage done to towns in Hokkaido is bound to raise fears in Tokyo of a
severe earthquake hitting the area in the near future. The Kanto plains,
where Tokyo is located, were devastated by a quake in 1923 and studies
suggest that another could occur in the not too distant future.

FT  14 JUL 93 / Rising death toll stokes Somali hatred against UN: The

impartiality

   THE killing of four journalists in Mogadishu on Monday
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
shot, stoned and clubbed to death by a mob seeking revenge for its own dead
 -has laid bare how tragically the United Nations humanitarian mission in
Somalia is unravelling.
Since the UN launched its night-time bombing raids over the capital in
retaliation for the slaying of 24 Pakistani soldiers last month, gunmen
loyal to General Mohamed Farah Aideed have turned south Mogadishu into an
urban guerrilla war theatre.
The rising death toll - 35 UN troops, more than 100 Somalis - and the UN's
decision to single out Gen Aideed as the chief villain in a land of feuding
warlords, has stoked Somali hatred against what is now perceived by many as
a foreign occupation force.
On Monday, after American Cobra helicopters bombarded a compound in the
heart of the city, the hatred spilled over to encompass all foreigners.
The journalists who were mobbed and killed at the bombed compound were well
known to the residents of south Mogadishu. These Somalis used to entreat
foreign reporters to come to see the destruction wrought by UN forces. Mr
Dan Eldon, a 22-year-old British-American Reuters photographer, was so well
known in the area after working there for a year that he had been nicknamed
the 'Mayor of Mogadishu'. That he should have been stoned to death indicates
how radically the mood has changed.
The UN's crusade against Gen Aideed has made the general into a local hero,
when only a few months ago his authority was waning. It has also damaged the
UN's claim to be an impartial policeman and further undermined its
credibility among Somalis.
Accounts of the recent attack diverge significantly. Gen Aideed's National
Somali Alliance claims a meeting of clan elders was taking place when the
compound came under attack. It says 74 people were killed and more than 200
wounded.
But Mr Barry Walkley, the UN spokesman in Mogadishu, insisted yesterday that
the compound was a command centre and rallying point for Aideed militia. 'We
are convinced there was no loss of innocent lives during Monday's assault,'
he said. 'UN troops counted 13 militia (members) dead and 15 wounded, maybe
more. There is no way 70 people could have been killed.
The question of UN-inflicted civilian casualties is straining relations
among the 20-odd national contingents that comprise the 20,800-member UN
peacekeeping force
Suspicion, mistrust and national rivalries are undermining the UN's military
command structure, formally under the authority of Turkish Gen Cevik Bir but
led in practice by Gen Thomas Montgomery, commander of the US forces in
Somalia.
The 2,600-strong Italian contingent is now allegedly taking its orders from
Rome and has refused to follow instructions from the UN command. Leading
Italian newspapers were united yesterday in their condemnation of the US-led
assault, after Mr Fabio Fabbri, defence minister, openly called for the
suspension of all UN combat operations in Mogadishu.
Rome fears the UN is sinking deeper into a military quagmire in Somalia and
is reluctant to become involved in a prolonged, senseless conflict. Mr
Fabbri's remarks earned him a sharp rebuke from Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali,
the UN secretary general, who said it was unacceptable for any troop
contingent to take action outside UN command.
UN officials distrust what they see as Italy's separate agenda in its former
colony. They suspect the Italian contingent may have struck a deal with Gen
Aideed's Habir Gedir clan following the deaths of three Italian soldiers
earlier this month.
They believe the Italians may have created a safe haven for Gen Aideed's
gunmen and perhaps even for the fugitive warlord himself.
Aid agencies too are increasingly critical of the UN's military operation
for losing sight of its political and humanitarian objectives.
'We are primarily concerned with the unnecessary loss of innocent lives,'
said Mr Howard Bell of Care International, who was in Mogadishu during
Monday's assault. 'Our relations with the military have deteriorated in the
past month. It has become difficult to plan relief work as we cannot always
rely on military escorts.'
Care has withdrawn all but three foreign aid workers from Mogadishu due to
the precarious security conditions in the capital. It says it has not been
able to supply its 35 feeding centres there on a regular basis since the UN
launched its military strikes in June. Before then, Care was feeding 175,000
displaced Somalis in the capital every day.
The UN, however, insists that any idea of reconciling rival clans and
promoting a political dialogue cannot be achieved until Gen Aideed's
militias have been disarmed. 'We need more troops,' said Mr Walkley. 'This
country is awash with weapons and we are not naive about the enormity of the
task. Security has become our paramount concern.'
But Mr Walkley admits that the UN is operating virtually under siege in the
capital. It has retreated into a heavily fortified compound on the outskirts
of town. UN staff are not allowed outside the compound and are transported
to the airport and other sights by helicopter.
Outside the capital, he says, progress is being made in bringing clan elders
together for talks. Kismayo, the southern port, is reported to have been
peaceful since two rival warlords were banished, and truces have been
negotiated in other areas.
But other Somalia watchers doubt whether the UN has the ability to fulfil
its aims. 'The UN is being naive if it thinks it can transform a desert
region of nomadic tribes into a model democracy,' said Dr Murray Watson, a
scientist who lived in Somalia for 14 years. 'I cannot think of a worse test
case for the UN's new role as global policeman. They simply don't have
enough experts to know what they are doing.'
He said: 'Somalis have a tradition in which blood crimes are repaid with
blood. For the past month they have been counting the death toll inflicted
by the UN. Foreigners will be killed in Somalia, whether they wear a Blue
Helmet, a nurse's uniform or a camera.'

FT  14 JUL 93 / Subpoena for Bush in BNL affair
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FORMER President George Bush has received a subpoena to testify and provide
documents in the long-running case involving more than Dollars 5bn of Iraqi
loans, made by the Atlanta branch of Italy's Banca Nazionale del Lavoro
(BNL).
Mr Bush has consistently denied any wrongdoing by the government in the BNL
affair. It is not known yet whether he plans to contest the subpoena.
The subpoena, filed by the lawyers of Mr Christopher Drogoul, former BNL
Atlanta manager, calls for the ex-president to appear in September at Mr
Drogoul's trial in Atlanta. It seeks from Mr Bush 37 documents, including
records of conversations with both Mr Giulio Andreotti, former prime
minister of Italy, and Mr Boyden Gray, Mr Bush's White House counsel.
Mr Drogoul, who is accused of masterminding a multi-billion dollar loan
effort that funded Iraq's nuclear and conventional weapons programme, has
changed his plea from guilty to innocent.
Last autumn, as the BNL controversy came to a boil in the closing stages of
the US presidential election campaign, a federal judge in Atlanta said he
suspected a US government cover-up and stated that CIA documents proved that
the Bush administration knew about and interfered with the BNL case.
Mr Robert Simels, Mr Drogoul's defence lawyer, said yesterday the Bush
subpoena was designed to prove that his client was merely a tool in a
broader effort by the US, Italian and British governments to help Iraq's
President Saddam Hussein during his eight-year war against Iran.
'The aim is to compel the former president to appear, and to produce
documents that relate to his knowledge of US foreign policy towards Iraq in
the 1980s, coupled with his efforts to assist Iraqi purchases backed by loan
guarantees from the US government,' Mr Simels said. 'We also want to show Mr
Bush's communications with Prime Minister Andreotti and the Italian
government on this matter.'
Mr Simels said a subpoena had also been issued to Kissinger Associates, the
consultancy headed by Mr Henry Kissinger, former US secretary of state. He
is seeking to quash the subpoena.

<TEXT>
US WHOLESALE prices fell last month, indicating that inflationary pressures
are moderating, the Labour Department reported yesterday.
The producer price index for finished goods fell 0.3 per cent in June, the
biggest monthly drop in two years. The annual rate of wholesale price
inflation fell to 1.4 per cent against 2 per cent in May.
The decline in inflationary pressures was led by a 0.9 per cent drop in food
prices in June compared with May, and a 0.5 per cent fall in energy prices.
However, excluding the volatile food and energy components, the core
producer price index fell 0.1 per cent. In May, core producer prices rose a
modest 0.2 per cent.
If consumer price figures due today are equally encouraging, the Federal
Reserve is likely to become more relaxed about the inflation outlook. In
May, after a series of unexpectedly large price increases, it shifted to a
bias towards raising short-term interest rates. An early rise in rates is
not now expected.
Analysts said severe flooding in the Midwest was already pushing up some
agricultural prices, but the sluggishness of the economic recovery was
expected to prevent them feeding through into a broader increase in
inflation.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Catholic Church and the conservative press, two pillars of Argentina's
establishment, yesterday attacked President Carlos Menem's campaign to seek
a second term when his present mandate ends in 1995.
His re-election effort has become the main political issue in Argentina
because it would require a constitutional amendment. A presidential
incumbent may not serve the next term.
Unlike Mr Menem's free market economic reforms, his re-election drive has
aroused strong opposition from business and led to renewed attacks by the
Church.
Yesterday, the influential conservative newspaper La Nacion condemned Mr
Menem's plan for a plebiscite to accelerate the amendment.
Plebiscites are not binding on congress, but the opposition fears the
government would use a likely majority to intimidate congress into backing
an amendment.
The Church's magazine, Criterio, asked in an editorial if Mr Menem's
re-election effort were due 'only to the attraction of power' or to 'the
necessity to perpetuate a group in power so that acts of corruption are not
investigated'.
The Church is divided over Mr Menem's economic strategy, with conservatives
backing his policies and liberals demanding greater social justice. However,
both wings appear to have united in opposition to his re-election.
The attacks on Mr Menem follow the formal proposal last Thursday by Peronist
(government party) senators to amend the constitution. They suggested
broadening civil rights and strengthening the judiciary, as well as lifting
the re-election ban.

FT  14 JUL 93 / World Bank lending soars: Loans reach record Dollars 23.7bn
</HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE WORLD BANK increased its lending by Dollars 2bn to a record Dollars
23.7bn over the past 12 months, with a sharp rise in new loans to recent
members in eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union.
But political turmoil and a shift in the bank's lending strategy, away from
adjustment lending and towards individual projects, led to a fall in lending
to Africa.
New commitments there dropped to Dollars 2.8bn in the 1993 accounting year
which ended on June 30, compared with Dollars 4bn in the previous 12 months.
Commitments to Europe and central Asia rose to Dollars 3.8bn, compared with
Dollars 2.1bn in the previous year, largely because of Dollars 1.63bn in
loans to eight countries of the former Soviet Union which have just joined
the bank.
Overall, new commitments from the International Bank for Reconstruction and
Development, the core of the World Bank group, climbed to Dollars 16.9bn for
122 projects, compared with Dollars 15.2bn for 112 projects in fiscal 1992.
The International Development Association, the bank's unit which provides
low interest loans to the very poorest countries, committed Dollars 6.8bn to
123 projects in fiscal 1993, compared with Dollars 6.5bn for 110 projects in
the previous year.
The bank said preliminary figures for disbursements, or money actually
handed over to borrowers, showed an increase to Dollars 18bn compared with
Dollars 16.5bn in fiscal 1992.
While IDA commitments have been climbing steadily since 1988, IBRD lending
has been more stagnant, fluctuating between Dollars 15bn and Dollars 16.4bn
for several years.
Earlier this week, the bank unveiled a set of changes in management
practices designed to address criticism of over-emphasis on new lending, and
to improve the quality of its projects.
Reviews of its portfolios in countries such as India and Brazil has led to
Dollars 2.3bn of projects being cancelled outright, although most of the
savings are redirected towards other needs in the same countries.

FT  14 JUL 93 / Rescue plan for Everglades agreed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FLORIDA sugar-growers and state and federal officials yesterday agreed in
principle on a plan to clean up the endangered Everglades, ending a
five-year legal wrangle.
The plan, announced by Mr Bruce Babbitt, interior secretary, is the latest
in a series of compromise deals worked out by the Clinton administration to
settle disputes between business and environmental interests.
Under the agreement the sugar-growers have promised to spend up to Dollars
322m over 20 years to reduce pollution from fertilisers and increase the
flow of water to the Everglades, one of the world's most famous swamp areas
and home to a huge variety of plant and animal species.
The federal government will seek to contribute about Dollars 161m through
flood control projects and the services of the Army Corps of Engineers. The
state of Florida may also contribute funds to the project.
A further Dollars 21.8m per year could be raised from from a special local
tax, although this must be approved by voters.
The plan has emerged after a series of lawsuits by federal officials and
environmentalists. Phosphate fertilisers running off from sugar farms have
caused new vegetation to choke native plants. Changes in the course of the
Kissimmee river also damaged the Everglades by cutting water supplies.
While some environmental groups gave general support to the plan, criticism
is already emerging from environmentalists such as the Audubon Society, who
say they were excluded from the negotiations.
Issues left unresolved by the framework agreement include the timetable,
construction schedules and water quality standards, Mr Babbitt said.
One issue that promises to be contentious is whether sugar-growers can be
asked to contribute more money in 20 years if the goals of this project are
not reached.

FT  14 JUL 93 / Canada senate cancels its rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LAWMAKERS around the world who contemplate voting themselves large pay rises
in tough times may wish to take note of the recent humbling experience of
the Canadian senate.
The upper chamber of parliament has bowed to a public outcry by rescinding a
CDollars 6,000-a-year (Pounds 3,180) rise in expense allowances, which it
approved less than three weeks ago.
'The senate made a mistake on June 23, and public opinion on a matter of
this kind must be respected,' said Senator Lowell Murray, government leader,
at a special session convened on Monday night to overturn the increase.
The 104 senators owe their seats to patronage appointments by former
Conservative and Liberal prime ministers, but they are at present a little
more sensitive to public opinion than usual.
With a general election coming up within the next four months, both the
Conservatives and Liberals want to avoid anything that might risk driving
voters into the arms of smaller parties, several of which favour either
abolition or drastic reform of the Canadian federal parliament's upper
chamber.
The senators could not have chosen a worse time to award themselves an
increase.
The province of Ontario has just passed a law requiring 950,000 civil
servants to accept a three-year pay freeze and 12 days of unpaid leave a
year.
With the national unemployment rate at 11.3 per cent and inflation at 1.8
per cent, most private-sector workers can look forward to, at best, a token
pay rise this year.
Faced with the combined opprobrium of their party leaders, the media and the
public, the senators meekly accepted that an increase was not such a good
idea after all.
The vote to rescind the extra allowance was 80-1, with two abstentions.
The about-turn is 'not a humiliating thing,' Senator Murray declared, but
'the right thing.'
Not all his colleagues agree. The lone senator from New Brunswick who stuck
by his original vote noted that the arguments made last month, in support of
more generous travel and accommodation allowances, still applied.
'I've seen nothing to change my mind,' he said.

FT  14 JUL 93 / Schlesinger says ERM tensions are 'short term'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE tension within the European exchange rate mechanism is of a 'very
short-term nature', according to Mr Helmut Schlesinger, president of the
Bundesbank.
Attempting to play down pressure on the French franc, he said in Basle that
the ERM was more stable than at the time of disruptions last September and
December.
Mr Schlesinger claimed the Bundesbank's intervention in support of the
French currency showed co-operation between the two countries' central banks
was 'as close as ever'.
However, co-operation is unlikely to extend as far as assistance through
further reductions in Germany's leading interest rates at tomorrow's meeting
of the Bundesbank council. On July 1, the Bundesbank cut the internationally
important discount rate by half a point to 6.75 per cent and the lombard
rate by a quarter-point to 8.25 per cent.
A further move, following so soon after the Group of Seven meeting in Tokyo
and this week's squeeze on the franc, could damage the bank's prized
credibility by giving the impression that its policy can be swayed by
political pressure and 'short-term' exchange rate fluctuations.
Germany's latest inflation and money supply figures, the key to the bank's
rates policy, have been revised upwards since the last rate cuts, suggesting
little room for manoeuvre at present.
Inflation in June was 4.2 per cent a year, compared with 4.4 per cent in
January, while the growth in the M3 money supply measure was 6.9 per cent a
year, compared with the bank's target of 4.5 to 6.5 per cent.
While M3 expansion is expected to have fallen closer to the upper limit in
June, the Bundesbank's latest bout of franc-buying could push it up again,
according to Mr Gerhard Grebe, chief economist at the Bank Julius Bar in
Frankfurt.
The condition of the franc and the state of the German economy demanded
urgent supportive action support, he said yesterday. Even so, he expected no
immediate cuts, favouring July 29 - the bank council's last meeting before
the summer break - as the most likely and beneficial time.

FT  14 JUL 93 / Duisenberg in strong defence of French currency
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STRASBOURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A STRONG defence of the french franc's parity with the D-Mark was issued
yesterday by Mr Wim Duisenberg, chairman of the committee of European
Community central bank governors.
'In no way are the fundamentals out of line with existing parities,' he told
the European parliament. Interventions by the French authorities and other
central banks had defended the franc successfully so far, he said.
But he added that these interventions had been accompanied by firm measures
by the French authorities. He said the concerted voluntary defence of the
french currency was a 'true signal of co-operation within the exchange rate
mechanism'.
On the foreign exchange markets the franc steadied against the D-Mark,
ending a succession of sharp declines, after a show of support from French
and German politicians and central bank officials.
Currency traders said that sentiment toward the franc had improved and that
there had been fairly strong buying interest. But they warned that the
instability facing the currency might not yet have run its course.
Mr Duisenberg, who is also head of the Dutch central bank, argued that the
credibility of the EC's plans for economic and monetary union depended on
member states taking tough action to restrain budget deficits.
He said said public sector deficits would rise to more than 6 per cent of
the EC's gross domestic product this year - the highest ever recorded in the
Community's history and double the target set out in the Maastricht treaty's
goal of economic and monetary union.
He said tackling budget deficits was a prerequisite for easing monetary
policy. 'A credible, predetermined and irreversible path towards fiscal
balance is essential to improve the potential of the Community's economies,
and thus to retain confidence in the successful transition to economic and
monetary union.'
Mr Duisenberg's appearance at a plenary session of the parliament is rare,
reflecting a new assertiveness by the legislature whose powers will expand
once Maastricht is ratified.
Last spring, the central bank governors submitted a report on last
September's crisis in the ERM to the parliament, as well as the European
Commission and EC finance ministers. The report blamed a lack of economic
convergence among member states, inadequate policy mixes and a deteriorating
economy for the crisis and found no structural fault-lines in the ERM.
Mr Ben Patterson, a British Conservative MEP, challenged this interpretation
in a report to the parliament. 'Why was no action taken to ensure an orderly
realignment of currencies before the markets started the chaos,' he asked.
'What advice were the central bankers actually giving to the politicians at
that time?'
Mr Duisenberg had earlier set out the considerable difficulties in creating
a single European currency with uniform banknotes. National experience
suggested that it could take up to seven years, possibly even longer - a
hint that a real monetary union will not happen this century.
In his statement to MEPs, Mr Duisenberg urged member states not just to
tackle public spending but also structural rigidities in the labour markets
and to main wage restraint.
Wage growth in the EC in 1993 was 2 per cent lower than in 1992 and it was
vital to 'lock in' expectations that this trend would continue.

John Ridding and David Buchan on the fight to keep the franc strong
</HEADLINE>

IS France ready, in the midst of recession, to raise interest rates to
defend the franc, if joint declarations and interventions by French and
German politicians and central bankers fail to stem the currency's slide
against the D-Mark?
This is the question underlying the plight of the franc. On Monday it
dropped to below FFr3.41 to the D-Mark, or within two centimes of its floor
in the European exchange rate mechanism, although it steadied yesterday.
In its first three months, the Balladur government has had all its own way.
Since early April, French official rates have been cut nine times, while the
Bundesbank has only lowered German rates twice.
'The Bank of France has cut its intervention rate from 9.1 to 6.75 per cent
since April while keeping the franc stable, said Mr Piers Butler of Baring
Securities in Paris yesterday. 'Now we are seeing the turnaround.'
In 1991 and 1992 France repeatedly showed itself ready to raise rates when
necessary. But times are different now. The country is in recession and
unemployment rising. Indeed the main catalyst of the latest wave of franc
selling - apart from a general rebound in market sentiment about the D-Mark
 -appeared to be last Thursday's forecast by Insee, France's national
statistics institute.
It was gloomier than the government in estimating that France's gross
domestic product would contract by 0.7 per cent this year while its jobless
rate would hit 12.5 per cent by December.
The sight of a government increasingly constrained from raising rates by
domestic political and economic factors precisely at the moment when it
might need to do so for external monetary reasons, is always an enticing
prospect for speculators, as Britain found to its cost last autumn.
In retrospect, it is clear that Mr Edmond Alphandery, the economy minister,
was guilty of a bit of hubris on June 24 when he proudly said: 'The franc is
performing well, perhaps better than the D-Mark.' After the French minister
went on to make it appear that he was summoning his German opposite number,
Mr Theo Waigel, and Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank president, to
Paris for a discussion of 'concerted' interest rate cuts, Mr Waigel pleaded
pressing business and stayed home.
In the event, no lasting harm was done. The Franco-German economic council
meeting has been rescheduled for early August, and co-operation between the
two central banks seems as close as ever.
Addressing a joint press conference in Basle on Monday with his French
counterpart, Mr Jacques de Larosiere, Mr Schlesinger called the franc's
problems 'temporary', and said that the Bundesbank's co-operation with the
Bank of France 'is as close as it has ever been'.
Much of the franc's 'temporary' problem is due to the revival of the D-Mark.
Investors, having taken short positions on the German currency in June
following a series of pessimistic economic forecasts and warnings from Mr
George Soros, the influential currency trader, that the D-Mark was
overvalued, have hurried back to the German bond market.
'We have seen a huge shift from French to German bonds,' said Mr Alain
Galibert, economist at SG Warburg in Paris. 'Investors felt they were
underweight in the D-Mark. They are responding to attractive German bond
prices and to improved economic news from Germany.'
But many of the fundamentals of the French economy remain very sound,
particularly in relation to Germany. France's retail inflation dropped in
June to an annual rate of 1.9 per cent. Its superior wage discipline has
given it a 15 per cent competitive edge in terms of hourly wage costs over
Germany in the past five years. It recorded a FFr16.2bn (Pounds 1.85bn)
trade surplus in the first quarter of this year, and is set to retain its
current account surplus in 1993.
But the flip side of many of these achievements is recession, which has
depressed industrial prices, wages and imports. Prime Minister Edouard
Balladur is beginning to press on the fiscal accelerator, and promises
generalised tax cuts in the autumn. But these would only take effect next
year. Despite increased spending already on public works and housing, the
French construction industry is still forecasting a 4 per cent decline in
activity this year.
In these circumstances, the last thing the government wants to do is raise
interest rates, whose recent reduction is also considered essential to
giving the stock market a lift before the sell-off of state companies starts
in the autumn. Mr Balladur has had a considerable stroke of luck in that the
trouble for the franc only began just before subscriptions to his very
successful bond issue closed last Friday.
Some 1.4m French bought FFr110bn of the four-year Balladur bonds carrying a
6 per cent coupon, presumably calculating with the recent interest rate
decline they could not get a much better return elsewhere. Having got their
money, Mr Balladur could now raise interest rates, if he had to. If that
happened, some investors might cry foul. But there is no mistaking the
determination of the French political establishment to keep the franc locked
to the D-Mark. Mr Balladur himself said this week that he would resign
rather than devalue. 'If anyone wanted to carry out another policy' of
devaluation, protectionism, increasing the budget deficit, 'they would first
have to change prime minister,' he said.
Some backbenchers in Mr Balladur's RPR Gaullist party and the odd maverick
within the UDF, its coalition partner, are restive with Mr Balladur's strong
money stance. But no one of any import is pressing him to change. Least of
all, the president. On nominating Mr Balladur, Mr Mitterrand called for the
preservation of the European monetary system, saying that 'keeping the
franc's parity with the D-Mark is a precondition of this. Without a common
monetary system, there is no Europe'. That is French policy.

FT  14 JUL 93 / Bonn acts to curb soaring budget deficit: Sharp cuts in
welfare spending intended to prompt reduction in interest rates
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE German cabinet yesterday approved plans for sharp cuts in social
spending and unemployment benefits in an effort to curb the government's
soaring deficit and encourage the Bundesbank to continue cutting interest
rates.
Budget spending for 1994 was fixed at DM478.4bn (Pounds 187.6bn), up 4.4 per
cent on the current year, with a forecast borrowing requirement of DM67.5bn
 -almost identical to the current deficit.
At the same time the cabinet approved a medium-term financial plan to impose
a virtual freeze on nominal spending in 1995, and tight restraint until
1997, to reduce the deficit to DM48bn in 1996 and DM38bn by 1997. 'We have
laid the foundations for improving the ability of the Bundesbank to cut
(interest) rates,' Mr Theo Waigel said after the cabinet meeting, which was
attended by both Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank president, and Mr
Otmar Issing, his chief economist.
The 1994 budget is based on a forecast growth rate of 1 per cent in western
Germany next year, assuming a recovery in the first half of the year. For
the whole of Germany, the economy is forecast to decline by 1 per cent this
year, and grow by 1.5 per cent in 1994.
The budget of the labour ministry, including the payment of unemployment
benefit and financing job creation and retraining schemes in eastern
Germany, remains by far the largest single element: almost DM122bn, or a
quarter of total spending next year. Mr Waigel forecast an unemployment
total of 3.75m in 1994, suggesting a continuing rise in joblessness even if
the recession bottoms out. He said the aim of the budget, and the
medium-term financial plan, was to bring central government spending under
control, while still taking action to promote economic recovery.
The DM21bn savings package approved for next year includes a cut of three
percentage points in unemployment and social assistance benefits, a freeze
on pay in the public sector, and a clampdown on social security and tax
fraud intended to yield DM6bn. The cuts in spending resulting from the
package should produce savings of more than DM28bn in the federal budget by
1996, and more than DM34bn if the 16 federal states are included.
The package has antagonised trade unions and the Social Democratic Party,
the main opposition party in the German Bundestag, the lower house of
parliament. The SPD controls a majority in the Bundesrat, the upper house,
but it can only block cuts amounting to 5 per cent of the total package,
according to finance ministry officials.
The medium-term plan shows the federal budget deficit remaining at the
present level of more than DM67bn - or almost 15 per cent of the budget -
until 1995, before the spending squeeze and economic recovery bring it back
down to 10 per cent of spending by 1996 and under 8 per cent in 1997.
Mr Waigel said that the only alternative to the sharp cuts in social
benefits would have been to increase the level of borrowing, or to increase
taxation during the recession.
The former would mean that there would be no room for manoeuvre for the
Bundesbank to cut its interest rates further, whereas a further increase in
taxation would counteract any hopes of economic recovery.

FT  14 JUL 93 / German cabinet passes draft law on labour flexibility
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A DRAFT law on flexible working hours in German industry was approved
yesterday by the German cabinet.
The draft, which will replace 28 existing laws and regulations on working
hours, was hailed by Mr Gunter Rexrodt, the economy minister, as a leap
towards deregulation and improving the competitiveness of German industry.
Among a series of moves to introduce flexibility, the draft law would allow
companies to cite cheap foreign competition as a reason for requiring extra
production shifts on Sundays and holidays.
The reforms are intended to give individual enterprises and their workers
more responsibility for negotiating their own working hours, within limits
prescribed by the law.
While the normal working day for wage-earners remains fixed at eight hours,
they may work up to 10 hours a day taking time off to compensate for the
overtime over a period of six months. Hitherto they have been required to
take the time off within two weeks.
Workers and employers at individual enterprises will be allowed to negotiate
a compensation period of longer than six months, if they wish.
There will be a significant extension of the exemptions to allow for Sunday
and holiday working.
As far as foreign competition is concerned, employers can appeal for the
right to introduce Sunday and holiday shifts if they can prove that jobs are
threatened by cheaper manufacturers in other countries, where labour hours
and other social conditions reduce their costs.
The law, which has to be passed by the German parliament, will also remove
existing discrimination on women's working hours, such as night-shift
working, although it will continue to outlaw female labour in underground
mining.
Mr Norbert Blum, the labour minister, called on both workers and employers
to use all the available flexibility to decide their own working hours. 'We
need more creativity and more imagination in fixing working time,' he said.
'That could produce a significant improvement in productivity.'
He insisted, however, that the law would not mean a dramatic change in the
enforcement of Sundays and holidays as rest days.
'Sunday should not be a day like all the other days,' he said. 'People would
lose all sense of direction if they worked in a continuous grey
time-porridge.'

FT  14 JUL 93 / Italy to contain budget deficit with spending cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM

<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Ciampi government intends to hold down the 1994 budget deficit to
L150,000bn (Pounds 64.4bn) through swingeing spending cuts and only limited
extra revenue from taxes.
The combined effect of these measures will be to save L32,000bn on previous
projections. Officials involved in the preparation of the budget estimate
that without this, the rise in the public sector deficit would push the
figure beyond L180,000bn.
As much as two-thirds of the L32,000bn will come from spending cuts,
affecting both current expenditure and investment. The 1993 budget was
obliged to find L93,000bn to hold the deficit to L145,000bn - L150,000bn,
but the emphasis then was on a bigger tax take, while spending tended to be
frozen rather than cut.
In contrast, officials involved in the preparation of the 1994 budget say
fiscal pressure will be lowered 1.4 per cent next year. With the public
unhappy at having to pay out unprecedented quantities of money this year in
various taxes, a further tightening of the fiscal net risks being
unproductive. As a result, the emphasis will be on improving the efficiency
of tax collection and simplifying the way in which taxes are paid.
On top of an across-the-board cut of 3 per cent in each ministry's spending,
the government is looking at the health, welfare and education budgets for
additional savings. Considerable savings can be achieved through a freeze on
job creation especially in teaching where the education ministry has
continued to recruit extra teachers despite a stagnant population.
In health, reforms introduced in the 1993 budget are only just being felt
and the ministry's L100,000bn budget has overrun by L14,000bn. Yesterday,
one of Italy's research institutes claimed there were at least L11,000bn
worth of unproductive expenditure in the health budget.
Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, prime minister and former Bank of Italy governor,
will explain the budget to parliament on Thursday.
It is the first time in the post-war era that a budget for the coming year
has been prepared so quickly. Normally, the budget is not presented until
close to the obligatory cut-off date of September 30. But the current plan
was outlined by Mr Giuliano Amato, the previous prime minister, and pursued
by Mr Ciampi to underline Italy's commitment both to tackle the country's
budget deficit, which has reached over 10.5 per cent of GDP, and begin to
cut the level of debt, equivalent to nearly 110 per cent of GDP.
The macro-economic projections for the next three years showed 1994 growth
of 1.6 per cent rising to 2.5 per cent by 1996.

FT  14 JUL 93 / Sabotage of relief effort may force UN pullout from Bosnia,
warns Stoltenberg
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
MR Thorvald Stoltenberg, the international peace mediator for the former
Yugoslavia, warned yesterday that the United Nations might be forced to pull
out of Bosnia if the warring sides continued to sabotage the relief effort.
His warning came as an escalation in the fighting threatened to block
humanitarian relief from reaching besieged communities throughout Bosnia.
Mrs Sadako Ogata, the UN's High Commissioner for Refugees, is due to visit
Sarajevo today as Serb forces close in on the Bosnian capital.
While Bosnian Serbs tightened their grip on Sarajevo, Croats clashed with
Moslems near Mostar, south-west of the capital. 'It's an all-out Moslem
offensive on our positions,' said Mr Veso Vegar, spokesman for the Croatian
Defence Council (HVO). Bosnian radio said HVO units used small aircraft to
bombard the Moslems, stranded on the left bank of the River Neretva which
runs through Mostar.
Serb forces pressed forward, seizing three more villages after recapturing
Trnovo on Monday, reported Tanjug, the Serbian news agency. The military
campaign seemed of great importance because it was directed by Bosnian Serb
commander General Ratko Mladic.
The loss of Trnovo severed any link between Sarajevo and Gorazde, two Moslem
enclaves ostensibly under UN protection.
'The doors of Sarajevo are now open to the Serbs,' warned the 'war
president' of Trnovo in an interview broadcast on Bosnian radio.
Mrs Ogata's visit will coincide with a meeting of Bosnia's collective
presidency about peace proposals for the Geneva talks. The mainly Moslem
leadership has rejected Serbo-Croat plans for the republic's ethnic
partition.
Just 18 miles to the south, Sarajevo remains without electricity and water,
raising fears of epidemics.
While attacking UN 'safe areas', Bosnian Serb officials and their
counterparts in Serbia were stopping the relief operation by demanding
visas.
Ms Lyndall Sachs of the Belgrade UNHCR, office said: 'The visas are
completely outrageous. It will severely hamper operations, not only to the
Moslems, but to the Serbs as well.'
Seven Islamic countries yesterday committed themselvesto provide up to
18,000 troops for the United Nations protection force in Bosnia, Farhan
Bokhari reports from Islamabad.
Iran offered up to 10,000 troops, Pakistan 3,000, Bangladesh 1,220, Malaysia
1,500, Tunisia 1,000, the Palestinian delegation 1,000 and Turkey offered up
to a brigade in response to a request by Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN
secretary general, for more troops to protect safe zones.
Foreign ministers at the Organisation of Islamic Conference meeting also
agreed a 20-point action plan and called for measures to ensure prompt
delivery of humanitarian relief supplies, even if that required the use of
force.
'The OIC countries emphasised that their forces will be assigned for this
humanitarian mission to protect the people in Bosnia-Hercegovina,' the plan
said. 'They will in no condition be a party to any plan to partition the
country or to create refugee ghettos in Bosnia-Hercegovina.'
Diplomats said more commitments were expected within the next fortnight. The
meeting also called for an immediate lifting of the arms embargo.
The Islamic foreign ministers urged that the London conference on the former
Yugoslavia be reconvened to consider proposals submitted by the Bosnian
government for a political solution.

FT  14 JUL 93 / Community aid coffers run low: Warning from Brussels as EC
under pressure to give more

THE European Community, which will face pressure on Friday to commit
substantial new aid money to Bosnia, has all but run out of resources from
its humanitarian aid budget. 'We've emptied all the drawers; we're dry; we
have no money left,' said Mr Manuel Marin, commissioner in charge of
development and humanitarian aid.
The European Commission will this week approve an extra Ecu57.3m (Dollars
74.5m), on top of the Dollars 872m the Community and its 12 member states
have provided for the former Yugoslavia between September 1991 and the end
of this June.
But the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, which is calling
Friday's meeting of aid donors, is looking for Dollars 1bn-Dollars 1.5bn
more for the Yugoslav crisis, on top of the Dollars 1.3bn already spent.
The UNHCR is banking on the commitment made by last week's Group of Seven
meeting in Tokyo, which agreed in its political declaration that 'the flow
of humanitarian aid to Bosnia must be increased'.
As the donor of two thirds of funding so far, the EC will be expected to
provide the larger portion of new money, for what the US and Japan regard as
primarily a European problem, according to Mr Marin.
'The Community budget is in no condition to meet these demands,' he added,
unless the Twelve agree to raise the budget ceiling, a politicaly difficult
decision at a time when all member states are under pressure to narrow
widening budget deficits.
Since the Yugoslav crisis began two years ago, the EC humanitarian aid
budget has increased ten-fold, to around Ecu800m a year. But this money is
required for emergencies in some 30 countries, among them Somalia, Ethiopia,
Angola, northern Iraq, southern Sudan, Cambodia, the former Soviet republics
and central America.
A reserve emergency fund of some Ecu300m set up at the end of last year is
now virtually exhausted, and limited funds transferred from other areas like
the Phare programme for eastern Europe, or unspent commitments from the Lome
Convention programme for Europe's former colonies, have been used.
Mr Marin is essentially saying the Twelve will have to put their money
where, at least, the four EC members of the G7 put their mouths last week.

FT  14 JUL 93 / BA chief attacks Virgin court action
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH AIRWAYS chairman Sir Colin Marshall yesterday attacked Virgin
Atlantic Airways for its continued pursuit of legal action over the 'dirty
tricks' his airline played on it.
Sir Colin, pictured with some of the board at BA's annual meeting in London,
denied prior knowledge of the 'dirty tricks' and renewed his call for
arbitration. He said: 'We do not believe that what was done caused
significant damage to Virgin or brought significant benefit to BA.'
Virgin Atlantic chief Mr Richard Branson dismissed the offer. 'We might just
as well decide the matter by having a trans-atlantic hot air balloon race,'
he said, referring to an earlier exploit of his.
'I think it is looking more and more inevitable that it will end up in
court. You have to ask why BA wants the battle to be fought before an
arbitrator and not in the courts,' Mr Branson added.
'It is like Napoleon asking Wellington if he would move the battle of
Waterloo to a more convenient spot once fighting had already begun.'

FT  14 JUL 93 / Islamic force offered for Bosnia as relief fears grow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
SEVEN ISLAMIC countries yesterday offered to provide up to 18,000 troops for
the United Nations protection force in Bosnia-Hercegovina as top UN
officials warned that the international humanitarian relief effort might
have to be abandoned.
The officials in New York said there was a 'real risk' that the world body
might be unable to continue its operations in Bosnia.
In a further sign of mounting frustration in the Islamic world at the plight
of the Bosnian Moslems, the Islamic Conference Organisation called for an
immediate lifting of the arms embargo on Bosnia and backed the Bosnian
presidency's rejection of the Serbo-Croat plan to partition the former
Yugoslav republic.
Meeting in Islamabad, foreign ministers of 16 Islamic countries also called
on Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary-general, and members of the
Security Council to act immediately to relieve the grave situation in
Sarajevo and other Bosnian towns.
The offer to send troops to join the UN force - with Iran pledging up to
10,000 soldiers - poses a dilemma for Mr Boutros Ghali.
Despite promising to defend 'safe areas' for Bosnia's Moslems, western
countries have failed to provide sufficient ground forces for the task.
Pakistan has offered to send 3,000 troops, Bangladesh 1,220, Malaysia 1,500,
Tunisia 1,000 and the Palestinian delegation 1,000, while Turkey has offered
up to a brigade in response to an earlier request by the UN
secretary-general for more troops to protect safe zones.
In a sombre report to the Security Council, Mr Boutros Ghali spoke of 'the
deteriorating situation on the ground'. His special representative, Mr
Thorvald Stoltenberg, said the choice facing the UN in the republic was
'simple and stark'.
It was up to the UN secretary-general to decide how the OIC offer could be
used in the interests of peace, he said.
Noting that original estimates were that up to 32,000 UN troops were needed
just to protect the safe areas in Bosnia, including the besieged capital of
Sarajevo, he reported that only 1,120 had been deployed so far in a force
already scaled down to 7,500 at the Security Council's insistence.
Mr Stoltenberg explicitly rejected a contention by the Bosnian delegate, Mr
Muhamed Sacirbey, that his warning of a possible UN withdrawal was designed
to pressure the Moslem authorities into entering new negotiations. Mr
Stoltenberg appeared confident that all three parties to the conflict would
go to Geneva next week for talks aimed at a durable settlement.
In his own report, Mr Boutros Ghali said the 'stark realities were that
there was little prospect for implementing the safe areas policy before new
resources arrived and that the civilian population would face devastating
hardship next winter unless Unprofor focused on efforts to restore utilities
and humanitarian relief deliveries'.
Yesterday, in preparation for possible protection of UN troops guaranteeing
the safe areas, the US sent 12 ground attack aircraft from Germany to an air
base in northern Italy.
Defence officials in Paris said the French and British were also to send
aircraft which might be deployed if the UN called upon Nato air forces to
step up their missions in the no-fly zone over Bosnia.

FT  14 JUL 93 / Troops in Somalia defy orders from local commanders:
Critical decisions face UN as two peace operations encounter growing
troubles
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE CRISIS over the United Nations' peacekeeping role in Somalia deepened
yesterday as it emerged that UN troops in the country have been refusing to
obey orders from their local commanders, apparently on instructions from
their governments.
According to UN officials in New York, Italian, Kuwaiti and Saudi
contingents have been refusing to carry out orders given by the Turkish
commander, General Civek Bir.
Underlining the sense of disarray in the UN force, officials said some troop
commanders in riot-torn Mogadishu were reported to have been unwilling to
commit contingents to UN sorties because of the risk of casualties.
Last night, Mr Malcolm Rifkind, UK defence secretary, referring to UN
operations, including those in Somalia and Bosnia, said the organisation
could find itself out of its depth unless expert military advice to the
secretary-general, Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, was vastly improved.
'There is a powerful case for enhancing the military expertise available,'
he said in London. 'Otherwise the UN will be out of its depth very quickly,
if it is not so already.' Such assistance could take the form of a UN staff
college.
The UN ambassadors of the half-dozen countries with more than 1,000 soldiers
in Somalia were recently summoned to discuss the growing crisis by Mr Kofi
Annan, under-secretary general in charge of UN peacekeeping operations
worldwide. The envoys were told it was unacceptable for national capitals to
issue orders to contingents serving under the UN flag and Gen Bir's
authority must be respected.
The latest blow to the UN's authority in Somalia emerged as Italy, which has
voiced disquiet about the increasingly bloody operation, asked the UN for
its troops in Mogadishu to be moved out to safer terrain unless agreement
could be reached.
Mr David Andrews, Irish defence minister, called for a conference of the
countries contributing troops to Somalia. After addressing 80 Irish troops
about to go to Somalia, he said: 'It is important not to lose sight of the
fundamental reason for the UN presence in Somalia, which was to help create
the political and economic conditions whereby ultimately the Somali people
could help themselves.'
His call came a day after US helicopters blasted the command centre of
General Mohamed Farah Aideed, the fugitive warlord, leaving more than a
dozen dead and provoking a mob to kill four journalists in revenge. The
Organisation of African Unity called yesterday for a review of the UN
operation, saying the world body should resume dialogue with people there.
On Monday, UN officials rejected a proposal by Mr Fabio Fabbri, Italy's
defence minister, that combat operations be suspended in an effort to reduce
tension in the former Italian colony. This led yesterday to calls from the
opposition in parliament to withdraw the Italian contingent.
The US, which recently boosted its Somalia firepower to strike at Gen
Aideed's militia, announced yesterday it had again moved a task force of
2,200 marines away from Somalia and would begin withdrawing four AC-130
attack aircraft. But the Pentagon said this did not signal any softening of
US support for a military crackdown against Gen Aideed.

FT  14 JUL 93 / Output rise boosts pound and hope of firm growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, ALISON SMITH and PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SHARPEST monthly rise in manufacturing output for four years has
strengthened hopes for a sustained UK recovery.
The 1.8 per cent increase in May output was almost 10 times stronger than
market expectations, and points to robust economic expansion in the second
quarter. The rise was the highest since April 1989.
It was fuelled by buoyant car, computer and metals production, but the
Central Statistical Office said that the late May bank holiday had possibly
inflated the monthly figure.
The underlying trend, however, continued to show a healthy rise. In the
latest three months, output grew by 2.1 per cent compared with the previous
quarter, and was 3 per cent up on the same period a year ago.
The news sent the pound sharply higher against the D-Mark and the dollar.
Sterling closed 1 1/2 pfennigs higher at DM2.57 and rose 1 1/2 cents to end
the day at Dollars 1.4935. In New York the pound closed at Dollars 1.49775
and in late trading was at DM2.5735.
UK share and government bond prices were largely unchanged, treating the
figure as erratic after the CSO warning to regard the monthly figure
cautiously.
The FT-SE share index closed up 6.2 at 2,837.1, with dealers worried that
chances of an early interest rate cut were fading. In the government bond
market, an initial fall corrected itself, leaving prices only marginally
lower by the close. Traders said any price weakness reflected technical
pressures from weaker European markets rather than a substantial shift of
opinion on UK economic prospects.
The figures are likely to reinforce the hopes of Mr Kenneth Clarke, the
chancellor, that a strong recovery will reduce the need for tax increases to
tackle the budget deficit.
In the House of Commons, Mr John Major, the prime minister, said the figures
were 'clearly very good news indeed'. 'But it is only one of a large number
of signs that the economy is recovering. Retail sales are up, car
registrations are up, confidence is up, and unemployment is down,' he said.
Yesterday's figures cheered Tory MPs, still divided over the Maastricht
treaty and faced with unpopular policies such as imposing value added tax on
domestic fuel. Most Conservatives believe there will be a chance to ease
their political difficulties only when people become convinced the recession
is over. The CSO said all manufacturing sectors, other than food, drink and
tobacco, showed an even output growth in the latest three months.
Total industrial production, which includes energy and water supply, rose 2
per cent month-on-month and was up 0.4 per cent in the latest three months
compared with the previous quarter.

A DECISION not to confirm Mr Richard Markham, heir apparent at Merck &amp; Co,
to the position of chairman was yesterday seen as the most likely reason for
his unexpected resignation, writes Richard Waters in New York.
Since he was appointed to the number-two job of president and chief
operation officer last December, he had installed his own appointees at
senior management level. The speed of change and a reputedly aggressive
management style are understood to have caused disquiet.
Merck said yesterday that 'Mr Markham was a leading candidate' for the
chairmanship, 'but he was never the named successor'.

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A DECISION not to confirm Mr Richard Markham, heir-apparent at Merck, to the
position of chairman was yesterday seen as the most likely reason for his
sudden and unexpected departure from the company.
Since the 42-year old Mr Markham was appointed to the number-two job of
president and chief operation officer last December, leapfrogging more
experienced Merck executives, he had moved fast to install his own
appointees at senior management level.
The speed of the change, and an aggressive management style, are reported to
have caused disquiet among other senior executives.
Merck refused to say whether the board had decided against confirming Mr
Markham as successor to Mr Roy Vagelos, the chairman who is due to retire
next year. However, it added: 'Mr Markham was a leading candidate to succeed
Dr Vagelos, but he was never the named successor.'
The most likely successor to Mr Vagelos is expected to come from among the
four vice-presidents on the seven-person chairman's staff. No decision is
likely soon. Mr Markham is unlikely to be succeeded by another chief
operating officer, a title that had been created for him, the company said
Merck denied that the departure had been prompted by any disagreement over
business style, saying only that it was for 'personal' reasons.
Mr Markham's departure was seen on Wall Street as likely to make little
difference to Merck's overall strategy. By midday in New York the company's
shares had slipped by only Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 34 1/2 .

FT  13 JUL 93 / UN arms expert may fly to Baghdad this week
</HEADLINE>

   CAIRO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR ROLF EKEUS, head of the United Nations special commission into Iraq's
weapons of mass destruction, may fly to Baghdad this week in a further
attempt to resolve peacefully the latest stand-off between Iraqi officials
and UN weapons inspectors, diplomats at the UN said yesterday.
The UN Security Council was last night discussing its next move in the
impasse, which follows the abrupt departure from Iraq on Sunday of a UN
weapons inspection team after it failed to win Iraq's agreement to seal
monitoring equipment at two missile testing sites.
Mr Ekeus has visited Iraq before to defuse similar stand-offs. One UN
diplomat said another trip this week would enable the Security Council 'not
to act precipitately, but show that it was serious' about forcing Iraqi
compliance with Gulf war ceasefire resolutions.
Iraqi newspapers yesterday suggested Mr Ekeus would find little warmth in
Baghdad. The official al-Jumhuriya decried attempts to monitor the test
sites as 'evidence of the wicked and malicious intentions of Ekeus and the
criminal designs of those standing behind him'.
The Security Council has already warned in a June 18 statement of 'serious
consequences' should Iraq continue to resist UN attempts to monitor the
sites at al-Rafah and Yam al-Azim, respectively 70km west and south-west of
Baghdad. An earlier UN team failed to persuade Iraqi authorities to install
video monitors to prevent testing of missiles with a range of more than
150km, prohibited under ceasefire resolutions.
Diplomats in New York consider that no further warning to Iraq or UN
resolution would formally be required before a strike on the two sites, but
last night they were playing down any prospect of immediate action. 'We're
not at crisis point yet,' one said.
China, one of the five permanent members of the Security Council, yesterday
distanced itself from talk of a strike, with Foreign Ministry officials in
Beijing saying the confrontation should be resolved 'through consultation
and dialogue'.
Some officials in New York said they were inclined to apply more pressure,
but wait and see if Iraq would eventually back down, as it has in most
previous run-ins with UN inspection teams.
Nevertheless, an attack remains a clear option, one which was raised
immediately by Mr Al Gore, the US vice president, who warned Iraq not to
'trifle' with the world community.
The two sites are understood to be in industrial zones where there would be
far less risk of 'collateral' damage and civilian casualties than in last
month's US cruise missile raid on Iraqi intelligence headquarters in central
Baghdad.
Each site comprises a small cluster of buildings, with a test stand at each
to allow the monitored firing of missile engines - with liquid fuel at
al-Rafah and solid fuel at Yam al-Azim. The housing for these stands would
offer a natural target in any raid. It was at these that UN teams sought to
install cameras and later to seal and lock monitoring sensors.

Mr Noubir Amaoui, the secretary general of Morocco's influential trade
union, the Confederation Democratique du Travail (CDT), was released from
prison yesterday after being pardoned by King Hassan, writes Francis Ghiles
in London. He had been sentenced to two years' imprisonment for allegedly
'insulting the government' in an interview published 18 months ago.
Mr Amaoui is a member of the ruling council of the Moroccan opposition party
Union Socialiste des Forces Populaires (USFP). Three weeks ago the USFP won
48 seats in elections considered by observers to be the fairest in many
years.

Forty European intellectuals warned that the political far right was
infiltrating the press, publishing houses and universities and announced the

FT  13 JUL 93 / Union pact wins late reprieve for NY Post
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE ailing New York Post newspaper staggered back to life last night when
its unions agreed to large cost concessions demanded by Mr Rupert Murdoch,
who last Friday ended publication of the tabloid and abandoned plans to buy
it.
News Corporation, the media empire headed by Mr Murdoch, said it would
resume publication of the Post today.
The pact appeared to clear away the last big hurdle to Mr Murdoch's purchase
of the paper, although he still faces negotiations in the bankruptcy court
over a purchase price.
News Corporation has been managing the business under a contract with the
court since March 29.
Mr Murdoch walked away from the contract on Friday, complaining that the
group's 11 unions had failed to agreed to Dollars 6.2m (Pounds 4.1m) of cost
concessions which News Corporation said were vital to ensure the paper's
viability in the crowded New York market.
His action threatened the demise of the irreverent 192-year-old tabloid,
America's oldest continuously published newspaper, since no other serious
purchaser appeared in sight.
However, following a weekend of fresh negotiations, which New York governor
Mario Cuomo played a role in initiating, 10 of the Post's 11 unions agreed
to fresh concessions.
The eleventh, the Newspaper Guild, which represents about 290 of the Post's
700 workers, has not accepted a new contract but agreed to return to work
while negotiations continue. It is concerned about job security, while News
Corporation wants the power to make staff redundant.
Mr Murdoch owned the Post until 1988 but was forced to sell it because of US
rules forbidding cross-ownership of both a local television station and a
local newspaper.
However, the Post's dire financial straits encouraged the Federal
Communications Commission, the government body which oversees the media
industry, to give him a permanent waiver from this ruling.

FT  13 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: More downward pressure on equities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE recent uncertainty in the UK equity market was again in evidence
yesterday, with share prices coming under renewed downward pressure and the
market moving further away from the top end of its perceived trading range
of 2,600 to 2,900 on the FT-SE 100 Index.
Senior dealers were hard pressed to come up with a good reason for the
market's latest unhappy showing, but there was a growing feeling in some
areas of the City that the government's sale of its remaining near 22 per
cent stake in BT may not be going quite as well as some would have it.
'There is something unsettling the market and it is definitely not rights
issue stories; with BT3 so close, the authorities would not have allowed any
other substantial calls,' said one dealer.
He pointed out that Wall Street had made a relatively comfortable opening,
in spite of widespread worries that the US market could be overbought, and
that the big Continental bourses had performed well yesterday, with the DAX
up 20 points and the Paris market rallying well.
'The domestic economic news is okay, which leaves one thing - BT3,' he said.
Worries about the drain on institutional cash balances, following the
massive government borrowing requirement and the spate of rights issues -
more than Pounds 7bn worth - so far this year, have been around for some
time. An economist at one of the UK agency brokers put it bluntly: 'The
institutions have run out of cash.'
The Share Shops deadline for BT3 applications was 3.30pm yesterday, with the
public offer closing at 10am tomorrow. The international and retail tender
closes at 5pm on Friday, with dealings commencing on Monday.
Carr Kitcat &amp; Aitken, the stockbroker, issued a bearish review of BT
yesterday, claiming that consensus profits estimates for the company 'are
too high'. The broker lopped Pounds 520m off its current-year estimate and
Pounds 650m off that for next year, citing 'ominous regulatory developments
and a downbeat BT3 prospectus'.
The equity market opened on a drab note and was on the retreat for the rest
of an uninspiring session. The FT-SE 100 was down almost seven points by
10am, before staging a minor rally towards midday and then embarking on a
further slide, eventually coming to rest a net 12.3 down at 2,830.9, its
lowest since June 4, and a fall of almost 70 points since the start of the
month.
Turnover yesterday was low at 448.1m shares, with non-FT-SE 100 stocks
accounting for 61 per cent of the total. Mondays are traditionally low
turnover sessions for the market and dealers are worried that activity will
remain under pressure for the rest of the week. The value of customer
business transacted last Friday was Pounds 1.23bn.
The outbreak of price war among the UK tabloid newspapers, instigated by the
Rupert Murdoch-controlled Sun, triggered some sizeable selling of the
newspaper companies, with Mirror Group Newspapers shares notably weak, along
with United Newspapers.
Composite insurance stocks were given a rough ride as analysts began to
count the costs of the floods in the US. Banks provided one of the FT-SE
100's few firm spots in TSB, where there was talk of the imminent sale of
the Hill Samuel merchant banking operation. Oil shares were helped by a
further rise in crude oil prices.

FT  13 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: Newspapers hit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, JOEL KIBAZO, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The outbreak of tabloid price wars sent newspaper shares into a tailspin.
After The Sun cut its cover price by 5p to 20p and the Daily Mirror returned
fire with a one-day offer to buy the paper for only 10p, heavy trading in
Mirror Group Newspapers pushed the price down 14 to 153p. Volume in the
shares, which have enjoyed a strong run lately, was 3.3m.
Casualties spread throughout the popular press as some investors feared that
News International's strategy may take the Sun's price lower if it was
reaping sales, while others believed that the furore was merely a summer
campaign.
United Newspapers - exposed to the price battle through the Daily Star and
Daily Express - lost 7 to 535p. Daily Mail &amp; General Trust shares fell back
Pounds 1 1/4 to Pounds 99, while News International, owner of The Sun,
softened a penny to 215p.
Analysts felt that although Mirror shares had taken a knock there was
underlying support for the stock amid the uncertainty sparked in the sector.
One dismissed the fall as 'a knee-jerk reaction'.
A stock overhang resulting from a large sell order was said to have
unsettled Kwik Save and the shares came off 16 to 691p. Dairy Farm was
identified as the buyer of 600,000 of the rumoured 1.5m line, with some
suggestions in the market that a further block of stock may be around. The
Dairy Farm purchase takes its stake in Kwik Save up to 29.4 per cent.
Avonmore advanced 7 to 150p after announcing the purchase of a Midlands
dairy business, although the news depressed Northern Foods, off 5 at 251p.
Results from MFI Furniture were at the bottom of most analysts'
expectations, but after the recent weakness in the share price it closed the
session 1 1/2 better at 128 1/2 p.
Flat sales figures from Darty, the French electrical retailer owned by
Kingfisher, hurt the latter, which fell 11 to 589p.
Nervous trading in Tiphook, the container rental group, sent the shares
further into retreat ahead of tomorrow's figures. The stock ended 14 lower
at 274p.
Reports that BAA, the UK airport operator, was in discussions to take a
stake in Chicago's O'Hare airport, left the shares 4 easier at 709p.
However, a further decline was prevented by news of a 4.2 per cent increase
in passenger traffic for the month of June, against the same period a year
earlier.
Conglomerate Tomkins tumbled 11 1/2 to 212 1/2 p, making it the day's worst
performer in the FT-SE 100 Index. Strong selling saw volume rise to 6m
shares, as the group reported figures at the bottom end of market
expectations.
Profits jumped 29 per cent to Pounds 171m, but analysts were particularly
unhappy with the lack of detail on the performance of RHM, which it acquired
last year. Tomkins' prediction of earnings growth of between 13 and 14 per
cent also left some analysts unimpressed.
Television stocks, still in an excitable state after the wave of takeover
fever in the sector, traded nervously while awaiting a statement by Mr Peter
Brooke, the national heritage secretary, on ownership rules for ITV
companies.
Anglia TV fell back 15 to 320p; Central Independent TV lost 52 to close at
1978p; Scottish TV, which also saw Morgan Grenfell's stake fall to below 3
per cent, gave up 15 to 524p; Yorkshire-Tyne Tees TV lost 8 to 196p; and
Carlton Communications retreated 10 to 767p. LWT Holdings preference shares
lost 12 to 458p and Granada dipped 4 to 407p.
Mr Brooke's statement came late in the trading day and said little other
than he was reviewing the rules.
A specialist said investors are puzzled by the complexity of the ownership
rules and the sector is suffering uncertainty. He added, however, that there
was a growing market expectation that some consolidation in television
ownership was an inevitability.
Weekend press speculation that the chairman and chief executive of Spring
Ram, the troubled building products group, may resign saw the shares advance
rapidly, closing 5 1/2 up at 54p. However, sources close to the company were
still insisting yesterday that Mr Bill Rooney, who was returning from
holiday, retained the support of the board and would only volunteer to
resign one of his posts.
Light profit-taking and a big seller of Commercial Union seen early in the
day left the shares 11 cheaper at 604p. Worries about the floods in the US
and the constant fear of hurricanes in the US was also said to have played
its part in the decline. Those same fears hurt General Accident, leaving the
shares 8 lower at 613p.
Several stocks in the aerospace sector benefited from the speculation of a
big aircraft order from Saudi Arabia. These included Rolls-Royce, where the
shares advanced 5 1/2 to 142 1/2 p, on volume of 3.4m, on suggestions that
it was in line to win the order for the engines that will power the aircraft
bought by Saudi Arabia.
Dealers were also cheered by reports that the UK government plans to raise
the ceiling on foreign ownership in both Rolls-Royce and British Aerospace,
from the current level of 29.5 per cent to between 40 and 50 per cent.
Rolls-Royce reached its limit last month but remains attractive, especially
to US buyers, some of which have had to settle for warrants issued through
Lehman Brothers.
Another possible beneficiary of an order from Saudi Arabia is TI Group,
whose subsidiary Dowty manufactures the landing gear on the Airbus aircraft.
The shares firmed 2 to 338p in thin trading.
Bid speculation returned to Lucas Industries shares, which finished 2 ahead
at 148p. Volume was 3.2m.

FT  13 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: Devenish deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, JOEL KIBAZO, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Drinks group Boddington finally exited from JA Devenish yesterday as it
off-loaded the near 20 per cent holding it had been sitting on since its
failed attempt to land its rival two years ago. Boddington's stake had been
overhanging Devenish since and prompted continued speculation that the
northern brewer would return to the fray - a threat dispelled last month by
the bid for Devenish by Greenalls.
The Boddington disposal now clears the way for the smooth takeover by
Greenalls, whose Pounds 214m bid has since been recommended by the Devenish
board.
Boddington was said to have sold its holding at an average of 360p a share -
a healthy premium to the average 211p a share it paid in July 1991 when it
was building up its predatory stake. The sale price was also at a premium to
the 356.5p cash alternative offered by Greenalls, whose all-paper offer
valued Devenish at 390p a share. The main reason for the high bid price had
been to prevent Boddington from rebidding. Boddington shares steadied at
277p, Greenalls slipped 2 to 354p and Devenish lost a penny to 363p.

SPECULATION of a lucrative order and news of an improvement in car sales
sent British Aerospace sharply forward yesterday. Talk heard last week that
Saudi Arabia was about to announce a substantial order for Airbus aircraft
gathered momentum, with the order said to be for both the A320 and A340
aircraft.
Buyers were further attracted by news that sales of Rover cars rose by 13
per cent in the first half of this year, above market expectations.
Analysts also predicted that the company's regional jets joint venture with
Taiwan Aerospace was about to be completed. Yesterday the stock surged ahead
15 to 420p in brisk trade of 5.3m shares.
Mr Keith Hodgkinson at Lehman Brothers believes the shares will remain in
the 400p to 450p trading range in the near future and predicted that they
will rise to more than 500p next year.

PRE-BT3 excitement was blamed for thin volume in the stock index futures,
with investors thought to be saving themselves for trading in the stock,
Christine Buckley writes.
A total of 6,618 lots were traded in the FT-SE 100 September future in a
range which stretched from 2,850 at its high point about half an hour into
the day's trading to its low of 2,825 which was hit about 3pm when any
optimistic signs from the US were dampened by a subdued Wall Street opening.
'There were just not the institutional buyers out there,' said one trader.
The directionless trading which has been one of the main features of the
futures market continued with little prospect of a change as dealers
struggle to find a handle on economic prospects.
The September Footsie contract started the day at 2,844 and closed 3 points
lower at 2,841. It was 3 points ahead of its fair value premium to cash,
which is 7 points.
Traded options also suffered from low volume, a total of 16,553 lots being
traded, against last Friday's 24,314. Of the stock options, BAA was the most
active with 1,517 contracts dealt.
The expiry of the July contract on the Euro FT-SE 100 option - which is due
this Friday - was seen to stimulate some action, with a squeeze pushing its
volume to 1,012 lots.

FT  13 JUL 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow subdued awaiting
inflation news
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US SHARE prices were stuck in a narrow range amid light trading yesterday as
dealers and investors prepared for this week's important inflation data and
the start of the quarterly reporting season, writes Patrick Harverson in New
York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 3.32 at 3,524.38. The
more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 ended 0.87 firmer at 448.98, while
the American SE composite gained 3.73 at 438.10 and the Nasdaq composite put
on 1.86 at 707.67. Trading volume on the New York SE was 203m shares, and
rises outnumbered declines by 1,023 to 886.
The week opened on a subdued note, with volume modest by recent standards
and prices trapped close to opening values. The lack of activity was due
primarily to caution ahead of this week's inflation figures.
The June producer prices index is due to be released today, and the consumer
prices index tomorrow, and although analysts have forecast good inflation
news, investors were reluctant to trade in front of the figures.
The start of the reporting season, which will get under way in earnest this
week, also seemed to be keeping many on the sidelines.
Ford, which has been well-bid in recent weeks, ran into heavy selling after
a downgrade by broking house Salomon Brothers, and a cut in its earnings
forecast.
Salomon's analyst said he was concerned by the deterioration in the
manufacturer's product mix, in particular its growing reliance on fleet
sales. Ford dropped Dollars 2 to Dollars 50 1/8 in volume of 2.3m shares.
Although the rest of the sector held up well on the news for much of the
day, late selling eventually took its toll. General Motors lost Dollars  1/2
at Dollars 46 7/8 and Chrysler eased Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 47.
Federal National Mortgage Association, the country's largest mortgage
provider, fell Dollars 2 to Dollars 82 5/8 amid profit-taking after the
company announced second-quarter earnings of Dollars 458.8m, the 22nd
consecutive quarter of record profits.
Merck dipped Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 34 1/2 in reaction to the announcement,
released late last Friday, that Mr Richard Markham, the company's president
and chief operating officer, had resigned.
Aluminum Company of America (Alcoa) declined Dollars 1 to Dollars 70 1/2
after posting second-quarter earnings down 21 per cent, before special
items, from a year earlier.
Home Shopping Network rose Dollars 1 to Dollars 13 5/8 in volume of 3.8m
shares after its main rival, QVC Network, proposed a merger between the two
in a stock swap transaction. QVC, traded on the Nasdaq market, jumped
Dollars 2 1/2 to Dollars 67 3/4 .
Canada
TORONTO'S gold and energy issues rebounded from last week's soft levels,
leaving the TSE 300 index closing 23.1 ahead at 3,950.5 after a week of
consolidation. But volume was moderate, falling to 45.7m shares from
Friday's 60.2m.
Precious metals shares were outstanding, the gold and silver index showing a
gain of 2.1 per cent, while the oil and gas sector rose 1.0 per cent.
Hyal Pharmaceutical, up 20 cents at CDollars 4.65, said studies show that
its drug delivery system aids in delivering drugs to cancer tumours.

GOLD shares receded from higher opening levels as investors remained wary of
bullion's short term potential, some brokers said. The golds index finished
just 4 up at 1,976 after a day's peak of 2,018. Industrials weakened 21 to
4,638 and the overall index declined 14 to 4,103.

FT  13 JUL 93 / World Stock Markets: German powerhouse for Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM COCHRANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Europe, up 2.4 per cent in local currency terms and excluding an unsettled
UK market, took most of the credit for last week's 0.9 per cent gain in the
FT-Actuaries World index. Nordic markets maintained their recent
contribution with a rise of 1.9 per cent, but Germany was the powerhouse
with a climb of 5.4 per cent, virtually all of which came last Wednesday and
Thursday.
Dealers were more bullish than analysts on Frankfurt ahead of the event. Mr
Patrick Bettscheider, equity dealing head at Bank Julius Bar in Frankfurt,
said last Friday week that the bank was seeing strong US demand for scrip,
and that foreign demand for German equities had been a feature of its
business over the previous six weeks.
German daily turnover was moderate at that time, in the DM6bn area, but last
week it hit a sequence of DM5.2bn, DM8.3bn and DM15.5bn.
In Dusseldorf, Merck Finck said there had been a change in Anglo-Saxon
investment attitudes, a feeling that the bottom had been reached in the
German economic cycle, a willingness to look through what will be some
dreadful results for 1993 into recovery prospects for 1994 and 1995.
In London, however, Nikko Securities, a bear of the market, expresses the
doubts which many share over the valuation base of the market. 'We believe
that the forthcoming reporting season will reveal that Geman industry is
still suffering from the recession and that the turnround is not close at
hand,' says Nikko in its current German weekly.
'In addition, the underlying structuring problems of reduced international
competitiveness and resilient inflation have yet to be addressed by the
market,' adds the Japanese broking house.
'The market is a fundamental sell, but in the near term, inward capital
flows and traders' reluctance to be short could mean a brief period of
activity around the (DAX) 1,800 level.'

FT  13 JUL 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei average rises on
hopes of an interest rate cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HOPES OF an interest rate cut brought buying and this, together with
speculation on a reduction in income taxes, enabled the Nikkei average to
break briefly through the 20,000 level during the session for the first time
since June 16, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The 225-issue index was finally 102.61 firmer at 19,980.00, after a day's
high of 20,011.70 and low of 19,889.89.
Prices eased back later from their earlier highs on reports of the
bankruptcy of an over-the-counter company, and uncertainty over financial
support for EIE International, an unlisted speculative property developer.
Volume fell to 230m shares from 473m. Advances led declines by 542 to 419,
with 181 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks rose
5.06 to 1,613.68. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index was unchanged at
1,227.62.
The yen weakened as the US-Japan bilateral talks ended with a trade
framework agreement calling for Japan to decrease its current account
surplus by increasing domestic demand, and expanding market access for
foreign products.
The dollar closed Y1.60 up at Y109.93, helping leading exporters. Hitachi
appreciated Y10 to Y851, Matsushita Electric Industrial gained Y30 at Y1,300
and Toyota Motor added Y30 at Y1,580.
Long Term Credit Bank and leading creditor banks of EIE International
announced that they would abandon restructuring of the company and write off
their exposure. Sea Com, an affiliate listed on the second section of the
TSE, was suspended, while another affiliate, Electronic and Industrial
Enterprises, was also suspended on the OTC market.
Phoenix Electric, a lighting equipment maker on the OTC market, was another
suspension, this time due to a subsidiary filing for bankruptcy.
Nikkatsu, the movie producer which recently filed for court protection, was
the most active issue of the day. It accounted for 30 per cent of total
volume and rose Y4 to Y29 in speculative trading.
Some financials gained ground on hopes of lower interest rates, with
Industrial Bank of Japan moving up Y10 to Y3,060 and Fuji Bank advancing Y40
to Y2,490.
Firm sales of new condominiums for June lifted real estate companies and
housing linked issues. Mitsui Fudosan rose Y10 to Y1,290.
In Osaka, the OSE average ended 28.99 ahead at 21,958.22 in volume of 11.6m
shares. Many investors remained inactive ahead of the general election this
weekend.
Roundup
THERE WAS a mixture of performances from the region's markets yesterday.
AUSTRALIA broke through the 1,800 level for the first time since October
1987 as investor demand spilled over from the successful flotation of
Woolworths. The All Ordinaries index closed 18.9 higher at 1,801.8; trading
was extended by 3 1/2 hours to cope with the new listing.
Shares in Woolworths reached ADollars 2.98 within a minute of listing,
against an issue price of ADollars 2.45, and finished with a 36-cent premium
at ADollars 2.81. Turnover in the stock was estimated at ADollars 91.8m,
boosting market turnover to ADollars 604.2m.
HONG KONG fell back sharply on selling by overseas institutions, but losses
were trimmed by late bargain hunting. The Hang Seng index finished 118.02,
or 1.7 per cent, off at 6,952.59, after an earlier fall of 167 points.
The current uncertainty in Sino-British talks on the future of the colony
continued to depress sentiment. Turnover was a thin HKDollars 2.9bn, against
Friday's HKDollars 3.3bn.
TAIWAN slipped back slightly on profit-taking and the weighted index closed
0.88 off at 4,078.71. Turnover shrank to TDollars 16.3bn from the TDollars
21.1bn registered during Saturday's half-day session.
The Investment Commission reported yesterday that new foreign investment in
the country had declined by 24 per cent in the first six months, compared
with the same period in 1992.
On a regional basis, investment from Japan and the US dropped by 60 per cent
and 24 per cent respectively. However, investment from Europe climbed by 72
per cent.
MANILA relinquished a little ground on profit-taking following last week's
rally. The composite index closed 1.71 down at 1,629.79 in turnover of
392.8bn pesos, compared with Friday's 355.8bn pesos.
SINGAPORE was led lower by weakness in bank and shipyard shares. The Straits
Times Industrial index fell 20.45, or 1.1 per cent, to 1,777.16. Volume
dropped to 95.4m shares from Friday's 126.3m.
BOMBAY fell in thin trading, the BSE index losing 33.73 at 2,181.10. Brokers
said the downward trend in the official trading session continued in
after-hours' kerb deals.
COLOMBO was firmer on strong demand for bank and hotel shares. The all-share
index rose 11.85 to 671.45 while turnover eased to Rp106.2m from Friday's
Rp116.3m.

FT  13 JUL 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Frankfurt bourse sets a new
three-year high
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INSTITUTIONAL enthusiasm for German equities, and the interlinked strength
of the US dollar gave bourses a reasonably good day, writes Our Markets
Staff.
FRANKFURT extended its official session to make up for early technical
problems, and ended the official session close to its best. The DAX index
closed another 20.76 higher at 1,818.17, its highest for nearly three years.
German turnover fell back to DM10.6bn after Friday's DM14.3bn.
Mr Nigel Longley of Commerzbank in Frankfurt credited G7 tariff cuts, and
apparent agreement about the prospect for further interest rate cuts between
the Chancellor, Mr Helmut Kohl, and the Bundesbank president, Mr Helmut
Schlesinger, for the changing tide of US, French and domestic investment
opinion about German equities.
'A couple of weeks ago,' he said, 'everybody had decided what to buy in
Germany - once the market had consolidated between 1,650 and 1,680. It did
not consolidate,' he added, 'and it impressed a lot of people that German
institutions were buying strongly in the latest rally'.
The institutions were apparent yesterday when share price rises were mixed
in scale but the market leaders, Daimler, Siemens and Deutsche Bank, rose by
DM16 to DM666, DM12.20 to DM655.50, and DM9 to DM734.50 respectively.
A number of the big blue chips, including the Bavarian mortgage banks, and
BMW and Hoechst, did relatively little; and Volkswagen actually fell DM1.80
to DM371.80 on news that papers had been found in connection with
allegations of industrial espionage against VW by the General Motors
subsidiary, Adam Opel.
VW was as much as DM9.50 lower on the Ibis market where, after hours,
profit-taking took the indicated DAX to 1,806 before it closed at 1,808.81.
PARIS took little inspiration from domestic news, either the slightly better
than expected June inflation data or the three times oversubscription for
the 'Balladur' bond. In spite of continuing pressure on the franc in the
currency markets the CAC-40 index moved up 6.52 to 1,992.22.
Roussel-Uclaf eased FFr17 to FFr558 as the stock was requoted following the
sale by Rhone Poulenc, up FFr3.30 to FFr149.00, of its 35 per cent stake
which was priced at FFr563 per share.
Accor gained FFr19 to FFr642 on news that an Australian group planned to
purchase its hotel interests in the Asia-Pacific region.
AMSTERDAM's CBS Tendency index gained another 0.6 points to 117.3 with
strong overseas interest seen in DSM. The chemicals group put on Fl 4.20 to
Fl 99.30 as it benefited from recent interest in cyclicals. The shares have
risen by more than 46 per cent since they hit an all time low in March.
MILAN remained subdued ahead of today's expiry of options contracts, while
investors were also awaiting details of the government's budget proposals
which are expected later this week. The Comit index closed up 1.76 at
546.00.
Many of the budget details have already leaked out in the domestic media.
According to NatWest Securities in London, the proposals are expected to
bring further spending cuts, rather than new taxes.
Fiat gained L77 to L6,482 at the fix, before easing back to L6,435 on the
kerb as profits were taken. There have been repeated rumours that the
Italian group might be considering a strategic alliance with Peugeot.
Ferruzzi fell L46.10 to L416.70: an executive of a subsidiary was arrested
at the weekend in connection with the wide-ranging investigation into
bribery.
BRUSSELS outpaced most bourses as foreign buying took the Bel-20 index up
16.77, or 1.3 per cent to 1,318.33 in high turnover of BFr1.2bn.
Ms Alison Kirk at Williams de Broe said that the share price gains were
broadly based, reflecting the potential effect of German interest rates, and
a rising dollar on the Belgian corporate economy.
STOCKHOLM closed at a new high for the year, mainly in reaction to the
strength of the dollar. The Affarsvarlden general index gained 12.40 or 1.1
per cent to 1,127.60 as turnover dropped to SKr755m from Friday's SKr871m.
Ericsson B shares, the day's most active issue, rose to an all time high
with a gain of SKr4 to SKr352.
The building and construction sector rose by 4 per cent on hopes of economic
recovery, with Skanska up SKr7 to SKr125.
VIENNA's ATX index ended 8.36 higher at 876.75, but the move did not reflect
the market's real gains as four stocks went ex dividend, including the
miner, Veitscher, which rose Sch10, ex a Sch6 dividend, to Sch272 and the
builder, Universale, which fell Sch5 to Sch935, ex Sch20.
ISTANBUL recovered some of last week's losses, although most investors
remained nervous in spite of an indication from the government that tougher
action would be taken against the Kurdistan Workers Party, which is seeking
a separate homeland in south east Turkey.
The composite index gained 462.9 or 4.5 per cent to 10,745.0 in turnover
down to TL554bn from Friday's TL839.5bn.

FT  13 JUL 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Germany supports franc
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHANIE FLANDERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bundesbank intervened to support the French franc yesterday as the
currency continued to face strong speculative pressure, writes Stephanie
Flanders.
In early morning trading the franc fell as low as FFr3.4125 per D-Mark, less
than 2 centimes above its ERM floor against the D-Mark of FFr3.4305. The
intervention caused some firming in the middle of the day, but afterwards
the franc continued to fall, closing at FFr3.416 from a previous FFr3.399.
The Bundesbank's purchases of francs came after supportive comments by Mr
Theo Waigel, the German finance minister, who reaffirmed the close ties
between Germany and France and expressed confidence in the fundamentals of
the French economy.
The day's developments confirmed the market belief that, to have a positive
effect, action to support the French currency would have to come from
Germany, rather than France. 'Because the trigger for recent events has been
the French need to cut interest rates, traders are not likely to take an
increase in French rates seriously,' one trader said.
Dealers now expect the Bundesbank to shave a few basis points from the repo
rate when it is announced tomorrow. The more important possibility is a cut
in the German Lombard rate when the Bundesbank council meets on Thursday,
but opinion is divided about whether this will occur.
'There is increasing optimism that there will be further rate adjustment
before the summer recess,' said a London-based dealer. 'But the people
expecting a cut on Thursday are being a little premature.'
On balance, most thought that the Bundesbank would do its best to hold out
until the council meeting on July 29 before a further cut in rates. Rate
reductions before then would risk a domestic bond market backlash, since
little has changed to German economic conditions in the 10 days since rates
were last cut.
However, the precipitous decline of the franc once the Bundesbank had left
the market cast doubt on the German authorities' ability to hold out. 'The
bottom line,' said Julian Jessop at Midland Global Markets in London, 'is
that Germans will cut rates if they have to.'
Some thought that even a cut in German rates would not be enough to avert a
crisis: 'this is about confidence in two economies, not the level of
interest rates,' one London-based trader opined.
The dollar benefited from its status as a safe haven currency, as well as
the fact that European interest rates are expected to fall soon. It rose
steadily against the D-Mark to end at DM1.7285 from Friday's DM1.7210. In
New York it finished at DM1.7298.
During the day, sterling seemed to benefit from its isolation from the ERM.
The currency closed 50 basis points firmer at DM2.5550.

FT  13 JUL 93 / Money Markets: French rates jumpy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHANIE FLANDERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FRENCH money market rates were jittery yesterday, reflecting uncertainty
about the immediate outlook for the franc, writes Stephanie Flanders.
The nature of the pressure facing the franc makes it difficult for traders
to know which way to jump. The market still feels that the French
authorities are desperate to cut interest rates for the sake of the domestic
economy. But there is a realisation, too, that the selling of the French
currency is exerting upward pressure on market rates.
Three-month French money market rates moved slowly upwards through the
course of the day, closing at around 7.87 per cent, compared with their
opening level of 7.75 per cent. A dealer suggested that this was more for
lack of anything better to do than any clear sense of direction.
French interest rate futures markets were even more subdued. The September
Pibor contract rose 2 basis points, ending at around 93.02, although the
bid-ask spread was narrow enough for this to amount to no change from this
morning's opening.
The Bank of England fore-cast a small shortage of Pounds 850m in the
morning, which was later revised to Pounds 900m. This was dispatched by
early afternoon in discount market dealing. Overnight rates fell to 4 per
cent.
Further out, rates were mostly unchanged. The three-month interbank rate
contin-ued to reflect a very slight easing of monetary policy by the autumn.
Generally, UK money markets were quiet, with dealers distracted by events on
the Continent. They were also awaiting a string of official data due this
week. The first of these, May's producer prices index, failed to move the
markets in any way. One trader said that traders were preparing for a long,
dull summer.
German call money traded in a relatively broad span of 7.35/50 per cent
yesterday as the market weighed up the chances of a cut in key Bundesbank
interest rates to allay tensions in the EMS currency grid. At the end of
last week, call money had been at 7.40/45 per cent.
Dealers speculated that the central bank might alleviate pressure from the
D-Mark's regained strength on other European currencies through a token cut
in its repo rate, or even a reduction of the 8.25 per cent Lombard rate.

FT  13 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Oil price up on Iraq/UN
deadlock
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NORTH SEA oil prices rose 30 cents after news of deadlock in the United
Nations/Iraq oil talks in New York over the weekend saw some traders taking
positions in the market early yesterday. But as the talks resumed in the
afternoon uncertainty over the outcome reasserted itself and trading dried
up.
North Sea Brent crude for August delivery rose to Dollars 16.90 a barrel -
still close to an 18-month low, but with traders more optimistic about the
price outlook.
Although the UN's difficulties with Iraq over weapons inspections are
separate from the oil talks, the conflict over the weekend led many traders
to increase the odds against Iraqi exports.
Baghdad must agree to allow UN officials to monitor the distribution of food
and medical aid purchased with the proceeds of the Dollars 1.6bn oil sales
under discussion. The details of the monitoring procedure have not been
discussed and the talks are believed to have made little progress.
The oil market will still be subject to increased volatility while the talks
are under way. But analysts are increasingly seeing the market's reaction to
the talks as exaggerated.
'If the talks finish in complete failure, I would expect to see Dollars 1 a
barrel - if not more - added to the oil price pretty rapidly,' said Mr Geoff
Pyne, oil analyst at UBS.

GOLD traders were divided yesterday on the likely direction of the market's
next decisive move. An early rise in reaction against Friday's setback was
capped by profit-taking at Dollars 395 a troy ounce and the price closed at
Dollars 394.05 an ounce, up Dollars 1.30 on the day but Dollars 5.45 below
last week's peak. At the London Metal Exchange the COPPER market continued
Friday's retreat as profit-taking and general liquidation weighed down
sentiment. Expected support at Dollars 1,950 a tonne failed to hold as the
three months delivery contract slipped Dollars 46 to Dollars 1,937.50 a
tonne. ALUMINIUM prices lost further ground following the International
Primary Aluminium Institute's announcement of a 50,000-tonne rise in
producer stocks in May, which reinforced bearish pressure. The three months
price closed at Dollars 1,217.50 a tonne, down Dollars 27 on the day, taking
it below the level ruling two weeks ago when Aluminum Company of America
sparked an upturn with the announcement of plans for substantial production
cuts. Dealers said disappointment at the failure of other producers to
follow Alcoa's lead had eroded the constructive impact of that move.

FT  13 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: China treats foot-and-mouth
outbreak as 'state secret'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BEIJING
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE CHINESE government is treating as a 'state secret' widespread outbreaks
of foot and mouth disease on pig farms in the country's south while infected
meat is still being sent to market.
Agriculture officials have confirmed outbreaks of epizootic aphthae, which
they refer to as 'disease number five', in Jiangsu, Guangdong and Anhui
provinces. One official in the south-eastern city of Suzhou in Jiangsu,
refusing to give details, would say only that it was a 'state secret'.
The disease is an air-born virus that, while not infecting people who eat
the meat of diseased pigs, render sthe pork unfit for human consumption. A
western agriculture expert based in Beijing said it was standard
international procedure to slaughter all infected animals and then
incinerate their carcasses.
He said that once epizootic aphthae made an appearance among livestock, it
spread rapidly and could be 'very nasty'. He added that it could easily be
prevented with wide-ranging anti-viral drugs not widely used or in some
cases even available in China.
Pigs farmers in China's south began slaughtering hogs in large numbers about
two months ago, but there has been no suggestion of localised quarantining
or of preventing the sale of the infected meat.
Pork is by far the favourite meat of the Chinese. Rising affluence has led
in recent years to a drop in pork consumption, though it still accounts for
more than 70 per cent of all meat eaten in China.
Figures from the Ministry of Agriculture show that last year China raised
380m pigs, 13.17m in Guangdong and 21.22m in Anhui. Most of the country's
pork is produced in south-western Sichuan Province, which is also China's
most populous. There have been no reports so far of any foot and mouth
outbreaks in Sichuan.
A veterinarian in Nantong city on the Yangste River north of the major port
of Shanghai said the disease was 'no longer a serious problem in Jiangsu
Province'. But he said there were outbreaks in Guangdong and Anhui
provinces, where substantial quantities of pork are produced for both
domestic and export consumption. Officials in both those provinces denied
the existence of foot and mouth disease on local pig farms.
The Nantong vet said 'disease number five' usually spread through southern
pig farms in early spring but pork from infected animals was sent to market,
as normal and as a matter of course.
He said details were kept secret because China was 'not a signatory to the
relevant international agreement that bans the export and sale of infected
pork'.
Most of the pork consumed in the British colony of Hong Kong and the nearby
Portuguese enclave of Macau, both of which border Guangdong Province, is
imported from China. China also exports significant quantities to the states
of the former Soviet Union and to North Korea, with smaller amounts sold to
Japan, Thailand, Singapore, the Netherlands, Germany, France and
Czechoslovakia. Last year Hong Kong also imported 25m kg of frozen Chinese
pork.
On an average day, 7,686 live pigs cross the Chinese border into Hong Kong,
1,411 from Guangdong. The colony's health department says imported pigs are
routinely inspected for foot and mouth disease, as well as other infectious
diseases and pest infestations.
The colony's veterinary officer said he had no knowledge of people getting
sick from eating meat from pigs infected with epizootic aphthae. 'Meat from
animals with foot and mouth disease, even accidentally contaminated, rarely
cause disease in human beings,' the health department said. 'There has not
been any case (of illness) reported through consumption of meat in Hong
Kong.'

FT  13 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Canada accuses EC over lumber
ban
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE EUROPEAN Community has banned imports of most kinds of untreated
softwood lumber from Canada to protect European forests from a microscopic
but voracious pest known as the pinewood nematode. The ban, which was
formally notified to EC members last Friday and takes effect on Aug 15, has
blown up into the most bitter current trade dispute between Canada and the
EC. While EC officials regard the new rules as a plant-health precaution,
Canada sees them as a trade barrier.
The Canadians accuse the EC of over-reacting to the nematode threat, thereby
endangering the livelihood of many sawmill workers in the provinces of Nova
Scotia, New Brunswick and British Columbia. The Canadian high commission in
London has already made several direct representations to UK prime minister
Mr John Major, asking for the ban to be relaxed. The ban affects the bulk of
Canada's CDollars 500m-a-year (Pounds 265m) exports of untreated lumber to
EC states, of which CDollars 350m is shipped to the UK. Under the new rules,
all Canadian lumber exports to Europe, with the exception of cedar, must be
either kiln-dried or heat-treated.
EC member states agreed earlier this year to allow an exemption for non-pine
species until October 1. But the commission's plant-health committee revoked
the exemption late last month after UK authorities discovered the
wood-boring insects that carry the nematode in two shipments of lumber from
Canada.
The nematode has devastated large tracts of pine forest in Japan, and Canada
has acknowledged that pine exports should be heat-treated or dried.
But Ottawa disputes scientific evidence supporting the EC's case for
treating other species, such as hemlock, spruce and fir. The EC is unwilling
to take the risk of relaxing the ban, but has offered to co-operate in
further scientific studies.
The Canadians are concerned that the ban will put their timber at a
competitive disadvantage to Scandinavian supplies. Canadian mills will be
forced to spend substantial amounts to install kilns or heat-treating
facilities.
The Canadian argument has an ironic twist, in that resource industries have
for years been urged to put more emphasis on adding value to commodity
exports. But by heating or drying their lumber, the Canadian mills face
being excluded from the large market for cheap, untreated lumber used, for
instance, for cement moulds on construction sites.

FT  13 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Indonesia's withdrawal from gas
field talks may be tactical
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM KEELING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JAKARTA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE INDONESIAN government has withdrawn from negotiations with Exxon
Corporation of the US over the Dollars 20bn development of the Natuna gas
field in the South China Sea. The move may, however, only be a tactical ploy
with the field remaining central to the future of Indonesia's liquefied
natural gas industry.
General Ida Bagus Sudjana, the energy minister, told local journalists of
the surprise decision last week whilst visiting oil facilities in East
Kalimantan. He is reported to have described Exxon's proposal as
'inefficient and unprofitable to Pertamina', the state-owned oil and gas
company. Exxon has a 50 per cent stake in the field with Pertamina holding
the remainder.
Pertamina has since confirmed the decision but an Exxon official in Jakarta
denied negotiations were now dead. 'We are currently in conversations with
Indonesia on this matter,' he said.
The Natuna field has 40 trillion (million million) cubic feet of proven and
probable reserves and could produce 14m tonnes of LNG a year, worth about
Dollars 2.4bn to Indonesia.
Divisions between the Government and Exxon apparently centre on how
production is shared with both parties demanding more than half the field's
output. Government officials say Exxon is also insisting on a concessionary
tax regime and a sovereign guarantee for its investment covering force
majeure risk.
Industry officials believe the two parties will end up back at the
negotiating table. While the Government had earlier warned it would consider
other partners, Exxon is considered one of only a few companies with the
expertise and capital to develop the field.
Natuna's high cost stems from the technical difficulties in separating the
natural gas from an estimated 70 trillion cu ft of carbon dioxide. The field
would take eight years to bring on stream, entail more than 700,000 tonnes
of offshore platforms and nearly 1,000 km (620 miles) of pipelines.
The field's economics may be marginal but industry officials say Indonesia
needs to develop Natuna to maintain its dominant position in the world's LNG
industry. The country exported more than 22m tonnes of LNG last year to
Japan, Taiwan and South Korea but 12m tonnes was produced by Pertamina's
Arun plant in North Sumatra, where reserves are running low.
New reserves have been found in Kalimantan and the completion of a sixth
unit and other improvements will boost production at Pertamina's Badak plant
in East Kalimantan by 40 per cent to 14m tonnes by 1995. Badak's higher
output is unlikely, however, to be sufficient to roll over long-term export
contracts, which begin to expire in 1999.

FT  13 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Olive branch offered in banana
dispute - A plan for Caribbean/Latin American peace talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CANUTE JAMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LATIN AMERICAN banana producers have offered an olive branch to their
Caribbean neighbours, saying they want to prevent the increasingly strident
debate over access to the European Community market from becoming a banana
war.
The Caribbeans have grabbed at the opportunity for dialogue and have invited
the Latin Americans to a meeting of trade ministers, likely to be held in St
Lucia later this month, to discuss the banana market, amid Caribbean hopes
that the arguments can be resolved without damage to the islands' exports
and their fragile economies.
The appeal for conciliation was made by Mr Rafael Calderon, the president of
Costa Rica, to the Caribbean Community (Caricom), when he addressed the
community's annual summit meeting. Costa Rica is not a member of the
community but is seeking observer status.
'We should resolve this dialogue without a banana war,' Mr Calderon said
after speaking to the Caribbean leaders. 'The fight for just relations with
Europe must continue, but there should not be a south-south fight. We back
preferences for Caribbean bananas, but we do not want the EC to lower the
quantities now exported by Latin America to the EC.'
The community's leaders immediately issued the invitation to the Latin
Americans to attend this month's ministerial meeting. 'There is a glimmer of
hope in the Costa Rican statement that a banana war should be avoided,' said
Mr John Compton, the prime minister of St Lucia, one of the four islands of
the Windward group whose economies are heavily dependent on bananas.
At the heart of the dispute is the new EC banana import regime that took
effect at the start of this month, which imposes a 2m-tonnes-a-year quota
for Latin American fruit. Shipments within the quota attract a duty of
Ecu100 (Pounds 77.60) a tonne while for imports above this level the duty is
Ecu850 a tonne. Caribbean and other traditional suppliers, such as those in
Africa, will have tariff-free access for the remainder of the EC's needs,
about 1.5m tonnes a year.
The Latin Americans, who are the more cost-efficient producers, wanted an
open market but traditional suppliers to the EC, mainly African and
Caribbean countries, said that without protection their industries, and some
economies, would be destroyed. Following the recent failure of Germany and
the Benelux countries to have the new import regime overturned by the
European court, the continuing dispute now hinges on attempts by the Latin
Americans to have a panel of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
declare the regime untenable.
The immediate concern of the Latin Americans, who shipped 2.4m tonnes of
bananas to the EC last year, appears to be what to do with the 400,000
tonnes they will not now be able to ship. Latin American official have said
they will lose about USDollars 1bn in export earnings over the next two
years.
'The new European regime means lower prices for bananas sold to the United
States,' said Mr Calderon. 'If Latin America has 400,000 tonnes left over
after it is allowed to sell its quota to the European market, and this goes
to the US market, then that will affect the price of the fruit which Latin
America sells to the United States.'
Mr Compton maintained that the Caribbean producers, and others in the
African, Caribbean and Pacific group of countries, which has a trade treaty
with the EC, were under attack from the Gatt, the Latin American producers
and the US companies involved in the Latin American banana industry. He said
there were already signs of increasing quantities of 'dollar' bananas as the
Latin American supplies are called, in the European market, and that that
was depressing prices.
Caribbean producers have tried, with no apparent success, to recruit the
support of the US in the debate over the allocation of market shares. The
mood in the region is somewhat bitter. Mr Edwin Carrington, the secretary
general of Caricom, said there was 'concern' in the region over the position
of 'friendly countries' such as the US that favoured the Latin American
arguments.
The region is clearly not convinced by statements made in Washington a
fortnight before the summit by Ms Donna Hrinak, the US deputy assistant
secretary for Inter American Affairs, that the US had not taken sides and
was not supporting Latin Americans producers to the detriment of those in
the Caribbean.
'The EC banana regime is inconsistent with the obligation which Gatt members
have, and inconsistent with what we hope will be the outcome of the Uruguay
Round which, when completed, will benefit all trading partners,' she said.
US officials at the Caricom summit said Washington's position had not
changed.
Mr Calderon forecast 'victory' for the Latin Americans in their effort to
win enough support at the Gatt and 'morally oblige the Europeans to
negotiate with us, although it is not our intention to harm, in any way
whatsoever, the exports of Caribbean countries.'
'There is no doubt that we in the Caribbean support open trade and fully
support the objectives of the Uruguay Round in GATT,' countered Mr PJ
Patterson, Jamaica's prime minister. 'Yet, we must find the right balance
that allows small exporters to find security in traditional markets.'

TAIWAN, PREPARING to begin trade in foreign futures contracts, had received
applications from 11 foreign and 15 local companies to set up futures
brokerages when the deadline for applications was reached yesterday, reports
Reuter from Taipei.
The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) said applications would be
screened over the next few months and trade was expected to start in the
first half of 1994.
Taiwan, which at present bans futures trading, plans to legalise the
industry as part of efforts to internationalise its financial markets and
become a regional financial centre.
The island already has a flourishing underground futures market in which
about 100 houses are believed to be generating total daily turnover of at
least USDollars 100m.

FT  13 JUL 93 / Government Bonds: French debt prices hold the line amid
currency battle

MILITARY analogies were back in fashion yesterday as the European bond
markets watched the French franc smash down through key support levels
against the D-Mark.
But while the currency appeared to retreat in tatters, French government
debt prices held the line and even advanced throughout the day.
Speculators sold the French currency down to FFr3.4150 against the D-Mark
yesterday morning, backed off and then returned in the afternoon to take it
down to within a centime of its floor in the European exchange rate
mechanism.
In the meantime, the German finance minister Mr Theo Waigel had offered
verbal support and the Bundesbank said it had intervened to support the
franc.
The Banque de France was conspicuous by its silence but it did attempt to
stem the tide by draining liquidity from the system at its weekly repo.
The central bank only provided the commercial banks with FFr10bn against
their demand for FFr70bn. The rationale according to one economist was that
the banks would have to use their available funds to deal with their daily
commitments and would have less spare cash to sell in the international
currency markets.
'The big guns are in place, the trenches have been dug and if it can hold on
until the summer recess, France should be clear until the autumn,' said one
bond trader yesterday.
That view found support in the bond market, which held firm throughout the
day. The September futures contract traded on the Matif slipped a little in
early trading but recovered its losses to close firmer at 119.78.
There was support also from consumer prices data for June, showing a
year-on-year rise of between 1.9 per cent and 2 per cent, while the
oversubscription for the Balladur privatisation bond was interpreted as
allowing the government more funds to stimulate the flagging economy.
Also, overseas investors had already piled out of the French market at the
end of last week and domestic bonds received some support from short
covering.
Finally, there was a feeling that the government was committed to lower
interest rates and to maintaining at the very least a dual central role
within the ERM.
GERMAN government bonds performed against initial expectations, sliding
gently on low volume as the D-Mark remained under pressure against the
dollar.
Traders said that, as with the franc, foreign investors had already adjusted
their funds by the end of last week and there was nothing to focus on.
The market is now concentrating on the possibility of an easing at
Wednesday's repo, which was carried out last week at 7.3 per cent.
More importantly, they are looking towards Thursday's Bundesbank council
meeting and the prospect of a further cut in the floor lending rate, the
discount rate, which is at 6.75 per cent, parity with the French
intervention rate.
THE rise and rise of UK gilts continued to surprise and astonish the London
market yesterday.
Apart from slightly encouraging data on inflation there was nothing to
galvanise the market but maturities at the long end of the yield curve
powered ahead again with 25-year maturities up half a point on Friday's
close.
SWEDISH government bond investors were diverted by an SKr6.5bn auction of
10-year and six-year government bonds.
The 10-year bond was relatively well covered at 1.62 times achieving an
average accepted bid price of 112.02 and a yield of 8.39 per cent. The
six-year maturity was also tightly bid but traders said the cover of 1.45
times was disappointing.
US Treasury prices firmed slightly at the long end of the maturity range
yesterday as the market traded quietly before this week's important
inflation data.
In late trading the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  7/32 at 106
1/2 , yielding 6.618 per cent. At the short end of the market, the two-year
note was unchanged at 100 9/32 , to yield 3.957 per cent.
Business was subdued throughout the day for two reasons. First, many traders
were absent, attending the annual Public Securities Association golf event
in New Jersey. Second, participants were reluctant to commit funds to the
market ahead of today's release of the June producer prices data and
tomorrow's release of the consumer prices figures. Analysts expect the data
to be bullish for bonds.

FT  13 JUL 93 / International Capital Markets: Steady stream of commitments
to Spanish facility
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Kingdom of Spain's Ecu4bn borrowing facility, hailed as the largest
financing to be put together by a European government this year, is 'drawing
a steady stream of commitments from banks', according to bankers involved in
the deal.
The three-year, multi-currency revolving credit facility is being arranged
by NatWest Capital Markets and has been described as fairly aggressive in
its pricing.
The Kingdom of Spain, which has a double A credit rating, will be paying a
margin of 7.5 basis points over the London interbank offered rate (Libor) in
addition to an annual facility fee of 5 basis points, to be paid
irrespective of whether the facility is drawn or not.
The participation fees (the fees paid to a participating bank) are
understood to be in the region of 7 basis points for Ecu300m, 5 basis points
for Ecu150m, and 3 basis points for Ecu75m.
NatWest Capital Markets points out that the terms on Spain's loan are higher
than those commanded by the UK, which last September set up an emergency
funding programme aimed at helping to support sterling in the foreign
exchange market. The UK is a triple-A rated borrower.
The UK Treasury's Ecu10bn funding programme consisted of an Ecu5bn
three-year multi-currency revolving credit facility with a margin of 9.375
basis points over Libor. There was a commitment fee of 5 basis points, which
applied if the facility was not drawn, and a front-end fee of 3.125 basis
points.
The Kingdom of Spain's deal is not intended for currency support, but as a
means of establishing long-term liquidity.
The facility has already been fully underwritten by a group of banks
consisting of ABN-Amro Bank, Banco Bilbao Vizcaya, Citibank, Dresdner Bank,
National Westminster Bank, Societe Generale, and Sumitomo Bank.

FT  13 JUL 93 / International Bonds: Investors snap up Y150bn Eurobond offer
from Italy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Republic of Italy took another step forward in its international
borrowing campaign yesterday with the launch of a Y150bn, 10-year Eurobond
issue.
Dealers said the issue was snapped up by institutional investors, many of
whom were keen on the relatively high coupon and wanted to get into
long-dated yen-denominated bonds ahead of a possible interest rate cut.
There is plenty of speculation that the Bank of Japan may ease soon, even
though the official discount rate is already at 2.5 per cent, and some
investors appear to be looking for further appreciation of the yen against
the US dollar, dealers said.
Italy, which has an A1/AA credit rating, last tapped the Euroyen sector in
1987 with a Y150bn issue that matured last year.
Yesterday's deal was priced to yield 72 basis points over the
widely-followed No 145 JGB (which has a nine-year maturity), or 62 basis
points over the No 157 government bond which has a 10-year maturity.
Nomura, the lead manager, said the bonds traded up from the re-offer price
of 99.474 to 99.50-99.52 by late afternoon.
Other dealers said the coupon of 5.125 per cent was seen as attractive by
investors, giving a yield of 5.2 per cent at the issue price.
The lead manager looked at comparable long-dated Euroyen issues from Spain
and Finland when pricing Italy's bond - these borrowers have nine-year
issues trading at yield spreads of 52 basis points and 62 basis points
respectively over the JGB.
Among the handful of new issues in the international bond market, a Eurolira
offering from UBS Finance raised some eyebrows because of its aggressive
pricing.
UBS Finance launched a L250bn, seven-year bond with a coupon of 9.25 per
cent - the lowest coupon seen so far this year in the Eurolira sector, which
has only recently grown accustomed to the idea of coupons below 10 per cent.
At the re-offer price of 99.50, investors obtained a yield of 9.351 per
cent, which is seen as far less generous than the yield on recent triple-A
issues such as the EBRD's latest deal.
Deutsche Bank London, which is joint lead for the issue with UBS, admitted
that 'not every bank is pleased with the price'.
However, it claimed that with the joint leads' very strong retail network,
the deal would be placed 'almost entirely' with retail investors.

borrowers

<TEXT>
JAPAN'S Ministry of Finance has eased restrictions on Euroyen bond issues by
foreigners and overseas bond issues by Japanese companies, Reuter reports
from Tokyo.
An MoF official said the deregulation will allow foreign governments and
institutions without a credit rating to issue Euroyen bonds.
He said the requirements were scrapped as foreigners wishing to tap the
Euroyen bond market tended to receive a credit rating automatically.
The MoF will also allow Japanese corporations to issue foreign bonds
overseas under a programme through which issuers can launch bonds quickly up
to a certain ceiling whenever conditions are favourable, the official said.
This is expected to shorten the time that it will take to issue foreign
bonds from the current 20 days to three days and at the same time reduce the
costs of documentation.
But the MoF will leave in place rules that require issuers to present a
statement of each bond issue to the ministry, he said. The system will be
useful for firms that often raise funds outside Japan.
The MoF official said there were not so many firms hoping to use the new
system, but that there was some demand.
Up to now, overseas subsidiaries of Japanese firms have been allowed only to
issue bonds abroad under a medium-term notes programme.

FT  13 JUL 93 / International Company News: A maverick takes to the golf
course - EIE faces collapse as banks get tough
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Mr Harunori Takahashi, president of EIE International, the Japanese
property developer, heard that five leading banks were planning to halt
their lending to his debt-ridden company, he took the news calmly. 'I'm off
to play golf,' he is reported as saying.
At least Mr Takahashi has a fine range of EIE International-owned golf
courses on which to practise while the payments mount on his company's
debts, conservatively estimated at Y700bn (Dollars 6.38bn). But there could
be cause for nervousness. The tough line being taken by the banks may yet
mark a turning point in the treatment of ailing companies in post-bubble era
Japan.
The action was initiated by the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan, EIE
International's main bank, which has about Y190bn in loans to the company,
about half of which LTCB has categorised as bad. LTCB wants to distance
itself from Mr Takahashi and his approach to the property empire's troubles.
Mr Takahashi was still confident last night that he would find other banks
to fund his company, but with LTCB and other past friends, including Mitsui
Trust and Banking and Mitsubishi Trust and Banking, not willing to lend
directly, it will be difficult for him to raise new funds in Japan.
At EIE's peak, Mr Takahashi had a glittering array of trophy properties. He
owns a fleet of luxury hotels including the Beverly Wilshire in Beverly
Hills, and a floating hotel in Vietnam. He also established a private
university in Queensland in tandem with Mr Alan Bond, the failed Australian
entrepreneur.
The conflict between the aggressive EIE International and its banks is being
played out against a background of a rising pile of non-performing property
loans. Japanese banks were able to exploit interest rate falls last year to
boost profits and write off a small portion of their exposure, but they face
increasing difficulties this year.
Officially, the country's 11 leading commercial banks have Y8,400bn in
non-performing loans, but that figure is unofficially estimated to be about
half the actual total. The banks generally do not include 'restructurings',
such as the EIE case, where interest rates are shaved to almost zero, or the
problem loans of finance company affiliates.
Japanese banks, unlike their US counterparts, are generally determined to
deal with their problem loans over the longer term, avoiding the
embarrassment of short-term losses. This strategy, mildly criticised by the
Bank of Japan, restricts the banks' lending ability and encourages them to
pass on the charges to more solidly based clients.
But, in the case of EIE International, the banks have decided that enough is
enough, although LTCB still plans to support some individual projects,
including Bond University and the vast Sanctuary Cove resort in Queensland.
A statement from the bank issued in Australia said that it 'wishes both
projects to carry on without interruption'.
The bank has also indicated that it will not necessarily abandon the
debt-burdened shipping and resort affiliate, Sea-Com, listed on the second
section of the Tokyo exchange, in which EIE International has a 45.7 per
cent stake, or the affiliated over-the-counter electronics company,
Electronic and Industrial Enterprises. Trading in both stocks was suspended
yesterday.
The timing of the banks' retreat is linked to unsuccessful attempts to
renegotiate a restructuring package negotiated two years ago, when the EIE
group's debts were estimated at Y1,000bn. LTCB says that it was interested
in putting together a new package, but could not reach agreement with Mr
Takahashi and had to stop fresh lending.
Apart from cutting interest rates and pumping in enough funds to keep the
company afloat, LTCB had provided EIE with five senior managers who were
supposed to work in tandem with Mr Takahashi. The five were given new
assignments at LTCB yesterday.
'We could not agree with EIE on the restructuring and have decided to end
our support. We just could not go on providing funds the way things were
going,' LTCB said. 'We are taking this action because we want to show that
we are financially sound.'
However, an EIE manager said the bank wants to distance itself from the
company, but would be unable to abandon it entirely. He said LTCB had become
annoyed because creditors were going to the bank before they called on the
developer to collect their debts.
'I think we will be okay. Mr Takahashi is still confident. Today he gave us
a rundown of the long-term business plans for the companies, so I don't
think he is very worried. We are relaxed,' the EIE manager said.
It is unclear whether LTCB and the other banks will be as prepared to pull
the plug on more mainstream clients who have heavy exposure to the stock and
property markets. The decision is easier in the case of EIE since it is not
linked to the large Japanese corporate families, and because Mr Takahashi
himself is seen as something of a corporate maverick.

<TEXT>
SHARES in Woolworths, the Australian retailer, relisted publicly yesterday
at a hefty premium, pushing the Australian stock market to its highest level
since 1987 and paving the way for a deluge of new company flotations.
Woolworths shares, issued at ADollars 2.45, closed at ADollars 2.81 after
trading as high as ADollars 2.98 following a three-hour extension of normal
trading by the Australian Stock Exchange.
The strong Woolworths trade, involving almost 92m shares worth ADollars
260.6m (USDollars 174.8), pushed total market turnover to ADollars 613m.
The float, Australia's biggest ever, consisted of 1bn shares at ADollars
2.45 each.
The vendors, Industrial Equity, received applications for 2.66m shares worth
ADollars 6.52bn and were forced to scale back allocations to both
institutional and public applicants.
Analysts said last night the lively showing meant that demand was likely to
spill over into other proposed Australian share issues, especially the
ADollars 90m raising by AAPC, incorporating the Australian assets of the
Accor Asia Pacific hotel group, and an ADollars 112m offering of gold
interests held by Ashton Mining, the Australian diamond producer.
The Australian government has also announced plans to float a further 19 per
cent of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia around September this year while
Burns Philp, the Australian industrial group, is also believed to be
considering an ADollars 400m float of its hardware division.

FT  13 JUL 93 / International Company News: Price rise boosts Gold Fields
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN increase of 9 per cent in the average gold price offset lower production
and allowed the four gold mines in the Gold Fields group to improve
after-tax profits by 15 per cent to R306.6m (Dollars 92.3m) in the three
months ended June compared with the March quarter.
Gold Fields does not sell production forward so its results are closely
geared to movements in the gold price. The average price per kg received
during the quarter was R35,672 compared with R32,716 in March.
This was offset, however, by the 6 per cent fall in gold produced to
28,775kg following a fire at West Driefontein and a fall in the grade at the
Kloof division of the Kloof mine.
The net effect of these conflicting trends was that working profit rose
marginally to R337.8m from R330.8m. A large jump in net sundry revenue -
mainly payouts from insurance claims related to fires - to R41.2m from
R13.9m helped bolster after-tax profit.
Commenting on the individual mines, Mr Michael Fuller-Good, general manager,
said Driefontein should be able to improve on its profits as the west part
of the mine had recovered from its fire. He said the Kloof division was
performing well, despite the recent fall in grade. He thought the Libanon
division, which made a working loss in the June quarter, was probably back
in profit at current gold prices.

<TEXT>
ALCOA of Australia, the Australian integrated aluminium producer, has
overcome flat demand and recorded a robust earnings performance in the half
year ended June.
Net earnings rose 45 per cent to ADollars 198.8m (USDollars 133.4m) in the
six months on a 2 per cent improvement in revenue to ADollars 1.09bn.
The result excluded an abnormal gain of ADollars 59.7m (against nothing
previously) reflecting a tax adjustment while capital expenditure was down
to ADollars 85.2m from ADollars 120.4m.
The company lifted its dividend payout to ADollars 180m from ADollars 120m,
most of it going to the two largest shareholders, Aluminum Company of
America and Western Mining Corporation.
Alcoa said the aluminium division had made a negligible contribution to
earnings, and operations remained under review following American Alcoa's
recent 25 per cent cut in primary metal output.
Tax took ADollars 100.8m and depreciation ADollars 73.4m. Interest expense
totalled ADollars 13.0m.
High aluminium stocks and low prices have hit the aluminium business
worldwide.
A large part of the industry's difficulties stem from an upsurge in imports
to the west from the former Soviet Union.

FT  13 JUL 93 / International Company News: Anglo American confirms
opposition to unbundling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ANGLO American Corporation, South Africa's largest company, has restated its
opposition to the concept of unbundling as a means of reducing its size and
influence in the local economy.
In his annual statement, Mr Julian Ogilvie Thompson, chairman, noted: 'The
corporation has no intention of mounting a major unbundling exercise. We
believe the corporation's overall structure is sound and continues to serve
the interests of the shareholders and the country well.'
Unbundling has been much in the news in South Africa recently following the
May announcement by Gencor, South Africa's second largest mining house, that
it planned to break itself up into smaller units, and last month's
cautionary statement from Barlow Rand, the largest industrial group in the
country, that it will split itself into three.
Mr Ogilvie Thompson had two main messages to deliver. First, that Anglo was
a dynamic company which benefited the economy. The second was a strongly
argued case about the appropriate aims and limits of competition policy,
unbundling and black empowerment - areas set for greater prominence under
any new black dominated government.
Anglo, and much of corporate South Africa, fears that the heavy-handed or
confused application of these policies could cause considerable economic
damage.
Mr Ogilvie Thompson argued that the most important aspect of competition
policy was to reintegrate the country into the global economy.
He conceded that Anglo and its associates controlled about 25 per cent of
the capitalisation of the Johannesburg stock market but he disputed that
this conferred excessive power which could be used to thwart the state.
He noted that Anglo accounted for about 6 per cent of the country's fixed
capital stock. He argued that far from being an 'acquisitive, short-term
orientated US-style' conglomerate, Anglo had been characterised by organic
growth, which accounted for as much as 80 per cent of the capitalisation it
controlled.
Mr Ogilvie Thompson said South Africa would have to find the right balance
between policies which sought to promote competition, and those which sought
to promote industrial capability, which probably involved favouring large
companies.

FT  13 JUL 93 / International Company News: More PC price cuts at Apple
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
APPLE Computer yesterday announced further cuts in the US prices of several
of its personal computer products.
The move followed reductions in May and June, as the company, which last
week announced deep job cuts, struggles to maintain its sales momentum amid
an industry-wide price war.
The latest round of price cuts applies to Apple's popular Powerbook notebook
computers as well as its highest performance Macintosh Quadra models.
In addition, Apple expanded a rebate promotion to cover the Performa product
line, which is aimed primarily at individual buyers rather than companies.
'The price reductions, and the Performa rebates, are part of our overall
company strategy to take aggressive actions in order to increase our market
share,' said Mr Bob Puette, president of Apple USA. 'With these actions, we
are making some of our most popular products more competitive.'
Apple reduced the US price of its Macintosh Quadra 950 systems by up to 29
per cent and also cut the price of its recently introduced workgroup server
computers by up to 20 per cent.
Powerbook prices have been reduced by seven to 34 per cent. Buyers of
Apple's Macintosh Performa PCs will receive cash rebates of Dollars 100 to
Dollars 200.
Despite the price cuts, Apple's share of the world PC market is stagnating,
according to industry analysts, and the company's profit margins have
declined.
In a move to boost profits the company said last week that it would lay off
2,500 people, or more than 15 per cent of its worldwide workforce, over the
next 12 months. Most of the job cuts are due to occur this month.
Apple has also frozen pay increases for all employees for an indefinite
period, and the company's top executives must take a 5 per cent pay cut, the
company said.
Mr Michael Spindler, Apple president, who was promoted to chief executive
officer last month, has declined to make any comment on the cost cutting
moves. Mr John Sculley, who remains chairman of the company, is on
sabbatical.

MOTOROLA, the US electronics and semiconductor manufacturer, reported record
second-quarter earnings, matching Wall Street expectations.
Net income rose 57 per cent to Dollars 224m, or 81 cents a share, from
Dollars 143m or 53 cents fully diluted. Revenues were Dollars 3.9bn, up 25
per cent from the Dollars 3.1bn of the same period last year. Net profit
margins on sales were 5.7 per cent , up from 4.6 per cent a year ago.
Semiconductor sales rose 28 per cent to Dollars 1.39bn, with orders up 30
per cent at an all time high, the company said. Orders increased most
rapidly in chips for the communications market.
Motorola's general systems group sales, which includes telecommunications
equipment, recorded sales of Dollars 1.18bn, up 40 per cent from the second
quarter of 1992. In the communications segment, including land mobile
products and the paging and wireless data group, sales rose 23 per cent to
Dollars 1.13bn.
Demand for Motorola's semiconductors, communications products and electronic
equipment continued to increase throughout most of the world, even in
regions such as Europe, where economic conditions remain sluggish, said Mr
George Fisher, chairman and chief executive.
For the half year, sales reached Dollars 7.56bn, up from Dollars 6.2bn in
the first half of 1992. Earnings were Dollars 428m, or Dollars 1.58 per
share, against Dollars 268m or Dollars 1.01, before the cumulative effect of
a 1992 change in accounting related to retirement health insurance benefits.
Fully diluted earnings per share were Dollars 1.53 for the first half of
1993, up from 99 cents a year earlier.

<TEXT>
NORTHWEST Airlines, the fourth largest US carrier, yesterday secured a
tentative agreement with its machinists' union and an agreement with the
Teamsters' union is believed to be immi-nent.
The airline, which is integrating its operations with those of KLM Royal
Dutch Airlines, needed significant labour concessions to remain operating
outside the protection of the bankruptcy courts.
Last week it ratified an agreement with its pilots' union which will save
the carrier Dollars 365m over three years.
Northwest has agreed that Dollars 61m of the savings from its pilots could
come from work-rule changes instead of direct wage and benefits cuts.
There is also a provision to give all employees the choice of being repaid
for their concessions within 10 years, or they may choose to receive as much
as 37.5 per cent of the common stock in the company.
Previous agreements had called for employees to receive a 30 per cent stake.
The machinists' pact replaces an agreement which was rejected by union
members last month.
The terms of the new agreement are believed to be similar to those of the
pilots' agreement. Northwest is now expected to reach an agreement with its
Teamsters' union shortly.

GENERAL MOTORS is opti-mistic about its second-quarter sales results but
third-quarter production schedules are not overly aggressive, Mr John Smith,
the group's chief executive officer, said yesterday, Reuter reports.
Mr Smith, speaking to reporters at a US-Japan business conference in
Cleveland, said GM had a 'good' second quarter. He addded that the US car
maker's vehicle sales were 'much stronger than anyone else on the retail
side'.
However, he said there was still a lot of uncertainty in the market place
and GM had not been too ambitious in planning third-quarter production.
According to Ward's Automotive Reports, GM plans to produce 655,000 cars in
the third quarter, up 46.9 per cent from a year earlier. It also intends to
produce 380,000 trucks in the third quarter, up 26.2 per cent from the third
quarter of 1992. 'Those schedules don't look overly optimistic,' Mr Smith
said.
He said the European vehicle market was still very weak, but added that GM's
European operations were performing satisfactorily. 'We're satisfied with
how we're doing' in Europe, he said.

THE HEAD of research and at least one other analyst from the Latin American
department of James Capel have resigned to join Bear Stearns, in an effort
by the US brokerage to boost its coverage of emerging markets.
James Capel confirmed that Geoffrey Dennis, the head of research, and
another analyst have quit, and that other defections were possible. But Mark
Donegan, head of emerging markets for James Capel, said: 'If they were other
resignations they would be very junior.'
James Capel's New York-based Latin American research team was recently
ranked joint first with Baring Securities in a survey of fund managers by
Institutional Investor. Mr Donegan claimed the defections would not hurt
James Capel's 29 member Latin America team, saying the brokerage 'has a
wealth of in-house research talent . . to fill in any gaps."
Bear Stearns confirmed the hirings but declined to comment further.
However,the brokerage is known to have made coverage of emerging markets a
priority. It was ranked fifth in the survey of Latin American research by
Institutional Investor, behind the British brokerages, and Goldman Sachs and
First Boston.

FT  13 JUL 93 / International Company News: Record second-quarter earnings
at Fannie Mae
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE FEDERAL National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) reported record
second-quarter profits yesterday as the favourable domestic interest rate
environment continued to provide a foundation for strong earnings growth.
The company, which is the largest mortgage provider in the US, announced
profits of Dollars 458.8m in the second quarter, up 14 per cent on its
earnings in the same three months of 1992.
It was the 22nd consecutive record-breaking quarter for Fannie Mae and was
achieved despite Dollars 39.8m in after-tax losses incurred from the call of
debt at a premium and the repurchase of high-coupon debt.
In the first quarter of this year Fannie Mae earned Dollars 443.6m, which
took six-month profits to Dollars 902.4m, an increase of 15 per cent on the
previous first half and on target for annual earnings to outpace the Dollars
1.62bn achieved in 1992.
Mr James Johnson, Fannie Mae's chairman, said a number of factors were
behind the latest record quarter, including strong growth in the company's
mortgage portfolio, increased interest income from the investment of
proceeds from repaid mortgage-backed securities, and continued high levels
of miscellaneous income, especially fees earned from the sale of REMICs
(real estate investment conduits).
Fannie Mae's net interest income jumped 22 per cent to Dollars 632.1m
following a 21.4 per cent increase in the size of the company's net mortgage
portfolio to Dollars 170bn and a widening in its net interest margin (the
difference between the interest it earns on mortgage loans and the interest
it pays to borrow money) from 139 basis points to 143 basis points.
The readings on the state of the US housing market suggested that there has
been little change in conditions over the past year.
Although Fannie Mae's acquisitions of single-family foreclosed properties
rose slightly in the second quarter to 2,790, its serious delinquency rate
for single-family loans, a key indicator of credit quality, declined to 0.59
per cent in May, down from 0.60 per cent in May 1992.
Fannie Mae shares rose Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 85 3/4 by midday yesterday
but later slipped to Dollars 82 5/8.

ALLIEDSIGNAL Automotive, a unit of New Jersey-based manufacturing group
AlliedSignal, is to set up a global automotive brake and friction material
business, headquartered in Drancy in France, AP-DJ reports.
AlliedSignal said the unit, AlliedSignal Braking Systems, will be its first

The group will also maintain offices at AlliedSignal Automotive's
headquarters in Southfield, Michigan.
The new company will be headed by Mr Stephen Rabinowitz, formerly vice
president of AlliedSignal Friction Materials.
Mr Rabinowitz said the brake business represents about half of AlliedSignal
Automotive's annual sales of Dollars 4.5bn.
The new subsidiary will provide 'complete braking systems capability, as
well as . . . components, while reducing cycle times and taking advantage of
synergies in product development, testing, sales and marketing', he said.

ALCAN Aluminium is joining a public review of its plans to complete the
Kemano hydro expansion in British Columbia.
The company has spent CDollars 500m (USDollars 391m) towards completing the
project and will invest more than CDollars 500m on further construction.
Kemano's first stage was built in the 1950s to support Alcan's 272,000
tonnes-a-year smelter nearby. Alcan's Canadian smelting capacity is 1.1m
tonnes.
The company suspended work on the Kemano project in 1991 after a federal
court ruled the project must go to federal environmental review. This was
reversed by the appeal courts, which found Alcan had fully met a 1987
agreement with the federal and British Columbia governments.
Last January the provincial premier Mr Michael Harcourt said the British
Columbia Utilities Commission would conduct the public review and report by
September 13.

ADOLPH Coors, the third biggest US brewer, is to cut 500 jobs, or about 20
per cent of its white collar workforce, in an attempt to reduce costs and
improve long-term profitability.
Coors, which is trying to compete more successfully with market leaders
Anheuser-Busch and Philip Morris, hopes to achieve the job reductions
through enhanced early retirement packages, incentives for voluntary
redundancy and attrition.
The company said the job cuts were part of a a wider plan which will include
reducing inventories of raw and finished goods, improving productivity,
using excess capacity and increasing the effectiveness of market spending.
In addition to reducing general and administrative costs, Coors plans to
farm out a large part of its marketing services and field marketing.
It said it would create a free-standing, independent marketing services
company - to be called Front Range Communications - which will provide
marketing support for Coors ranging from merchandising to trademark sales.
About 100 Coors employees will be offered jobs in the new agency.
Mr Leo Kiely, president and chief operating officer, said: 'Coors Brewing
Company has outpaced the industry in volume growth rate for eight
consecutive years.
'At the same time, we have lagged in providing adequate returns to our
shareholders. We are committed to improved profitability while continuing to
build our competitive position in the marketplace.'
Mr Arthur Wegner has been appointed chairman and chief executive of
Raytheon's Beech Aircraft unit, from July 19, Reuter reports.
Mr Wegner, also appointed a senior vice president, succeeds Mr Max Bleck,
who remains Raytheon president and group executive for aircraft products.

FT  13 JUL 93 / International Company News: Ontario Hydro sees bigger loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ONTARIO Hydro, North America's second-biggest power utility, has raised its
1993 loss estimate to CDollars 1.6bn (USDollars 1.25bn), citing slack demand
for electricity, write-offs related to restructuring, and continuing
problems at a nuclear power station.
Long-term borrowings this year are also likely to rise from CDollars 3.2bn
to CDollars 3.6bn, due to lower funds generated from operations and an
increase in the amount of bonds called so far this year.
A further CDollars 400m increase in the borrowing requirement will be
necessary if debt-restructuring proposals are approved.
The provincially-owned utility, which is based in Toronto, earlier this year
forecast a break-even in operations. But it said yesterday that it now
expected a CDollars 200m loss.
It ascribed the setback to a variety of factors, ranging from the weak
economy to unusual weather patterns and higher fossil-fuel energy costs. It
also said the economic outlook for future years was less rosy than
anticipated.
The extent of this year's loss will probably result in the depletion of the
utility's fund for rate stabilisation and contingencies, which stands at
about CDollars 1.6bn. However, it reaffirmed its earlier promise to freeze
electricity rates next year following several years of steep increases.
The rates freeze was among the early moves made by Mr Maurice Strong, who
organised last year's Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, when he took the reins
of Ontario Hydro earlier this year.
Mr Strong pledged a thorough shake-up and has also given notice of several
thousand lay-offs.
However, Energy Probe, a lobby group, expressed doubts yesterday whether the
promise to keep rates unchanged next year can be met.

The blocks, destined for Toyota Camrys built in Georgetown, Kentucky, will

180,000 blocks annually for the 16-valve engines.
GM said the agreement was part of a strategy to expand the business to

GM Powertrain's plant in Defiance manufactures grey iron and nodular iron

THE GREEK Ministry of National Economy raised Dr7.17bn (Dollars 32m) through
the partial-privatisation of its monopoly sugar producer, Hellenic Sugar
Industries, according to the ministry's advisers, Reuter reports from
London.
It was the first public flotation of a state-owned company in Greece and
paves the way for the privatisation of OTE, the telecommunications company,
due later this year.
'We are delighted with the outcome of the first public offering in Greece's
extensive privatisation programme,' Mr Stephanos Manos, Greek minister of
national economy, said in the statement issued in London.
The public offering of 4.652m bearer shares at Dr1,200 was more than five
times oversubscribed and the private placement for employees and sugar beet
producers more than one and a half times over-subscribed, the statement
said.
Following the part-privatisation, the state-owned Agricultural Bank of
Greece holds 70.48 per cent of HSI.
'Following this success, we look forward to the privatisation of OTE later
this year with a great deal of confidence,' Mr Manos said.
HSI has five factories and produces over 310,000 tonnes a year. It had
1992-93 pre-tax profits of Dr6.318bn.

MOODY'S, the US credit ratings agency, has downgraded the long-term debt
rating of Hazama, the Japanese construction company.
Hazama faces government penalties due to the involvement of executives in an
alleged bribery scandal. Moody's said the company's operating performance
and financial flexibility will be damaged by penalties, effectively contract
bidding suspensions, and downgraded its long term debts to B2 from B1.
The Ministry of Construction, the Ministry of Transportation and local
governments have suspended Hazama from bidding for new public projects in
the near term, after three executives were arrested.
Moody's said the penalty could affect Hazama's profits for the next few
years due to the company's dependence on public works projects. Some 30 per
cent of Hazama's non-consolidated revenue for the year ended March 1993 was
generated by public sector work.
The agency said the case would affect the company's relations with banks and
investors, and its private sector business.
Hazama already faces asset problems due to aggressive business expansion in
the late 1980s, and Moody's said the company was not prepared to face a
further fall in revenue.

FT  13 JUL 93 / International Company News: QVC in share-swap deal with Home
Shopping
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
QVC, one of the leading US television shopping networks, yesterday proposed
a share-swap merger with its chief rival, scandal-battered Home Shopping
Network.
The deal would create a formidable power in the emerging market for
electronic retailing with annual sales of around Dollars 2bn.
QVC has been headed since January by Mr Barry Diller, who helped Mr Rupert
Murdoch build Fox into America's fourth national television network.
Shares in QVC have more than doubled since his arrival, with investors
hoping he will inject programming flair into television shopping, a
retailing form which many analysts believe could enjoy explosive growth in
an age of inter-active television.
Home Shopping, a pioneer of electronic retailing, has been under a cloud in
recent months as a federal grand jury has investigated allegations that Mr
Roy Speer, chairman, and former executives of the group engaged in improper
financial dealings.
QVC, which reaches some 47m US homes, concentrates on the more up-market end
of TV retailing, and has a relatively polished style of presentation.
Home Shopping, which reaches some 60m homes, sells to the lower end of the
market and has a more aggressive retailing style. It is known for its
advanced telecommunications technology. Both companies generate around
Dollars 1bn in sales.
A merger would represent one of the last big consolidations in an industry
which attracted many participants in the 1980s, most of which failed to
generate the sales necessary for strong profits. Despite its supposed
potential, electronic shopping only generates sales around Dollars 2.3bn a
year
The QVC bid seems likely to go through since it has the backing of Liberty
Media, the controlling shareholder of Home Shopping, with 41 per cent of its
equity and 71 per cent of investors' voting power.
Liberty, which also holds a large stake in QVC, is a company spun off from
America's largest cable TV service company, Tele-Communications Inc, and is
chaired by Mr John Malone, who heads TCI.
QVC is proposing a reverse takeover under which Home Shopping would issue
five of its shares to the holder of each QVC share. QVC investors would also
be entitled to additional shares in Home Shopping, up to a maximum of 10 per
cent of its capital stock, dependent on unknown liabilities facing the
company - an apparent reference to the alleged scandal.
Home Shopping would retain its listing on the New York Stock Exchange, but
would change its name to QVC Network Inc, and the current QVC board would
replace Home Shopping's board.
QVC, quoted on the Nasdaq over the counter market saw its shares rise
Dollars 2 1/2 yesterday to stand at Dollars 67 3/4, giving it a market
capitalisation of around Dollars 2.6bn, while Home Shopping rose Dollars 1
to Dollars 13 5/8, for a capitalisation of around Dollars 1.1bn.

ESPIRITO Santo Financial Holding, which heads one of the largest financial
groups in Portugal, has placed 2.65m American depository shares, on the New
York stock exchange.
The shares were placed at Dollars 29 each and are being quoted at around
Dollars 27, said Mr Ricardo Espirito Santo Salgado, head of the group.
The offer was increased from an original 2m shares because of heavy demand,
which would have been enough to buy 5.2m shares. A total of 1.9m shares were
placed with institutional investors and the remainder with individuals in
the US and Canada. This was the second placement of shares in New York by
ESFH, which is quoted in London and Luxembourg.
Some 28 per cent of the group's capital is held by US and Canadian
investors. Grupo Espirito Santo continues to hold a majority of the company
followed by Grupo Freres of Belgium and Grupo Agnelli, which together hold 9
per cent.
Foreign institutions will be allowed to buy an 80 per cent stake in
Portugal's state-owned Banco Pinto e Sotto Mayor when it is sold in October,
Mr Fernando de Almeida, the bank's president said, Reuter reports from
Lisbon.
'The (BPSM privatisation) law does not set any limit on foreigners,' Mr
Almeida said.
The government would approve the law outlining conditions for the BPSM sale
in the next few days. 'Then there will be three months for candidates to
apply, so the operation should occur in October,' Mr Almeida added.

FT  13 JUL 93 / International Company News: Ericsson issue raises SKr2.2bn
</HEADLINE>

   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ERICSSON, the Swedish telecommunications group, said yesterday it had raised
SKr2.17bn (Dollars 301.3m) through a convertible bond issue to stiffen its
financial muscle in fast-growing markets where competition was intense from
rivals such as Siemens of Germany and AT&amp;T of the US.
Ericsson said orders were set to grow by more than 30 per cent this year to
more than Dollars 9bn and it needed the cash for 'acquisitions, financing
requirements by customers and because of general problems in the financial
market' - although it declined to be more specific.
'This is a way to try to ensure we have the financial wherewithal in a
relatively tight financial market,' the company said.
Ericsson has been riding a rise in new orders for more than a year,
particularly in its radio communications division. It has established a 40
per cent share of the world market for mobile telephone infrastructure
systems and has signalled a significant improvement this year on last year's
SKr1.30bn pre-tax profit.
It has been growing fast in China, which accounts for 7 per cent of group
sales, and is anxious to ensure it can continue to compete for business
where customer financing is required. 'In China and even in some other
markets there may be a need for us to help the customer with the financing
of deals,' the company said.
The issue of 4.25 per cent convertible subordinated debentures was fully
subscribed, with 50 per cent taken up by foreign investors. The bonds will
mature on June 30, 2000, with conversion to B shares available from August 2
at SKr300.

<TEXT>
MENSUCAT Santral, one of Turkey's leading textile companies, and its listed
affiliates, have been suspended from trading on the Istanbul exchange, after
the parent company applied to the courts for protection from its creditors
which are owed an estimated TL2,200bn (Dollars 213m).
The company is controlled by the Bezmen family. Last week the group sought a
court-arranged agreement with its creditors, to allow it to restructure its
debts with some 23 banks, which are owed about TL1,500bn.
The creditors list includes the foreign banks, UBS, Standard Chartered,
Bankers' Trust and West Deutsche Landes Bank.
However, the banks most exposed are those of the local Cukurova industrial
conglomerate - Interbank, Pamukbank and Yapi Kredi which are owed TL600bn.
The court has to make a decision within 10 days. If banks refuse to agree a
restructuring, the company will be forced into bankruptcy. Bankers say a
final settlement may take up to six months. The company has to show it has a
positive net worth and that its assets are greater than its liabilities.
Furthermore, two thirds of the creditors have to agree the planned
restructuring.
Yesterday, Mr Halil Bezmen, chairman and controlling shareholder, was
referring all enquiries to his lawyers.
Mensucat is one of the leading producers of textiles, Turkey's largest
export item, earning more than Dollars 4bn a year. Mr Bezmen, was described
yesterday by a foreign consultant as one of the best textile magnates in the
Mediterranean. However, the group is undercapitalised and over the past two
years has become over extended with a Dollars 120m investment programme
coupled with moves to diversify into copper and chemicals businesses.
Rabak, the copper business, has been particularly badly hit by the world
slump in copper prices.
Mensucat Santral, the cotton textile arm, made a loss of TL38bn in 1992 on
turnover of about TL1,000bn. Rabak reported a TL25bn loss over the same
period.
Last week, the exchange suspended shares of Santral Holding, Mensucat
Santral, Rabak and the chemicals operation Koruma while awaiting further
clarification from the company.
The market was earlier alerted to problems after the company had failed to
present year-end figures for 1992.

ASKO Deutsche Kaufhaus, one of Germany's biggest retailers, said yesterday
it had sold its remaining 7 per cent stake in AVA Allgemeine
Handelsgesellschaft der Verbraucher, another quoted German retailer in which
Asko used to own a 50 per cent interest.
In a brief statement, the Saarbrucken-based Asko said the sale of its entire
AVA stake since February had raised more than DM1bn (Dollars 625m). Mr Klaus
Wiegandt, chief executive, said that the sale had been achieved at slightly
above book value.
'With this step we have completed the most important part of our
disinvestment programme,' the chief executive said. Asko, majority-owned by
Metro, the large Swiss-based retailer, expanded rapidly in the late 1980s
but has embarked on a drastic rationalisation plan in order to cut its
debts, which stood at DM4.7bn at the end of March.
The Bielefeld-based AVA, nearly 50 per cent owned by Edeka Zentrale, had
turnover of DM6.8bn last year, up from DM5.1bn in 1991. It operates in the
discount market and derives 60 per cent of its turnover from food retailing.

SABENA, the Belgian national airline, said its first-half earnings fell by
BFr1.5bn (Dollars 45m) reflecting the difficult conditions in the
international air transport industry, Reuter reports from Brussels.
Sabena gave no final figure on its first-half 1993 earnings.
It said the earnings drop reflected the serious structural crisis in the
sector and the drop in prices this was causing, the economic crisis,
currency devaluations in a large number of European countries and the
political events in central Africa.
The board of directors had approved measures worth BFr5bn to deal with the
crisis in the air transport sector. The package involved an adjustment of
wage costs during three years to save BFr2bn, Sabena said. It included
measures to optimise its intercontinental and European networks, where the
hub and spoke network at Brussels airport would remain the focus of Sabena's
strategy.
Sabena said there would be large savings by making work organisation
flexible. This would be done by striking a balance between the workload and
available workforce in accordance with the agreement with organisations
representing the workforce.
Sabena employs about 9,000 staff.
Sabena is 37.5 per cent owned by Air France and about 49 per cent by the
Belgian state.

FT  13 JUL 93 / UK Company News: BAA may redevelop US airports

   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BAA, the UK airport operator, is in talks with several large US airports
including Chicago's O'Hare, the world's busiest, and New York's JFK, over
redeveloping the airports.
The company wants to take an equity stake in an airport or buy a lease on a
terminal. A deal could be signed in the second half of 1994.
The move would extend BAA's presence in North America beyond Pittsburgh
Airport where last October it opened a Pounds 4m shopping mall.
Since then, the average amount spent by a passenger at the airport has more
than doubled to Dollars 6 (Pounds 4) and BAA sees the project as a success.
The company is only in talks with international airports. That is where its
experience lies and where it can build lucrative duty free shops.
The Pittsburgh project has also served to introduce UK retailers such as WH
Smith to US airports and US retailers to the UK.

FT  13 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Debt precludes dividends at Lep
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LEP GROUP, the freight forwarding and security company, said that its heavy
debt burden effectively precluded any prospect of a return to dividend
payments in the foreseeable future.
Mr David James, the company doctor appointed chairman when Lep was last year
restructured by its banks, also told yesterday's AGM that a rights issue was
not an option.
He said: 'The most logical alternative is that the board will seek to
develop, as best as possible, the vitality of the core subsidiaries in order
that they themselves may, at some future date, be divested from the group to
realise their value.'
Lep may float off all or part of the equity in core businesses to reduce its
debt of Pounds 385m. Mr James said Pounds 143m of the debt was wholly used
as working capital in the remaining trading subsidiaries. The balance of
Pounds 242m was within the parent company and mainly reflected past losses
incurred in closed or divested activities.
Mr James believed the stage was set for recovery of the group, but the
timing would depend on a lifting of recessionary conditions in continental
Europe.
'The performance of our company in the east has been excellent and there has
been a strong recovery in North America. The recessionary conditions in
Europe remain much more severe than many politicians would admit.'

FT  13 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Dalepak reduced to Pounds 2.2m after second
half setback
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FIERCE competition in the food industry, higher meat prices and teething
troubles with a new freezer plant hit profits of Dalepak, the frozen foods
and ready meals maker.
At the pre-tax level they dropped from Pounds 3.93m to Pounds 2.21m over the
year to April 30.
In the second half pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 2.2m to Pounds 600,000,
after Pounds 1.6m (Pounds 1.7m) for the opening period.
The group warned in March that profits would be significantly below market
expectations at that time, but indicated that the dividend would be
maintained.
Yesterday that promise was kept with the recommendation of a 4.5p final to
give an unchanged total of 6p. With earnings per share down from 23.01p to
13p, the dividend is still covered 2.2 times.
Margins were affected in the second half by 'substantial increases in meat
raw material prices' triggered by sterling's devaluation last September.
Those higher costs could not be fully recovered through increased selling
prices.
Dalepak did not say how much delays in commissioning the new freezing plant
had cost.
The shares have fallen from a peak of 383p in January, when the interim
profits were announced, making Dalepak one of the worst performers in the
market in the first half of the year. Yesterday the shares fell again,
closing at 193p, down 12p.
Sales rose 4 per cent to Pounds 42.2m, but the financial year covered 53
weeks and on a comparable 52-week basis they were 2 per cent higher. In
frozen meat grill steaks, where Dalepak is the market leader, sales were
slightly up, but in vegetable products there was a fall, despite a 17 per
cent growth in the market.
Trading profits fell from Pounds 3.96m to Pounds 2.48m, with margins down
from 9.7 to 5.9 per cent. Interest rose from Pounds 33,000 to Pounds 268,000
reflecting a two-year Pounds 7.3m capital expenditure programme.
The group said trading conditions remained difficult, although meat prices
had stabilised. New products had been introduced and the completion of the
new plant should bring cost savings.
Gearing at the year end was just below 40 per cent (23 per cent).

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LOW &amp; Bonar, the international packaging and materials group, yesterday
reported a 21 per cent increase in interim profits, reflecting improved
operating margins following a restructuring programme.
The Dundee-based group, which has also made two significant acquisitions in
the UK carton sector in recent months funded by a Pounds 50.2m rights issue
in April, reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 14.3m for the six months to May
31, up from Pounds 11.8m a year earlier.
Turnover improved 13 per cent to Pounds 171.1m (Pounds 151m), boosted by the
acquisitions, which added Pounds 4.87m, and by currency translation
movements. Sales volumes were flat.
An interim dividend of 2.9p (2.7p) is payable from earnings per share ahead
14 per cent to 10.22p (8.94p restated).
Mr Jim Leng, who took over as chief executive last year, said the
improvement in earnings had been delivered 'in tough market conditions,
particularly on the Continent.'
Group operating profits increased by 28 per cent to Pounds 16.3m (Pounds
12.8m), including Pounds 857,000 attributed to acquisitions. Currency
movements accounted for a further Pounds 1m of the gain, although strong
currencies adversely affected a number of the group's Continental
businesses. Overall margins increased from 8.6 per cent to 9.9 per cent.
European profits rose by 20 per cent to Pounds 13.2m (Pounds 10.9m) with
Bonar Cereal Packaging, acquired from Kellogg in April, making 'an
encouraging' first contribution. The UK now accounts for nearly two thirds
of European profits.
European margins improved from 10.6 per cent to 11.2 per cent helped by a
continuing cost reduction programme.
North American profits rose by 68 per cent from Pounds 2.2m to Pounds 3.7m
following a restructuring programme begun in the second half of last year
which helped lift margins from 4.4 per cent to 7 per cent.
The higher operating profits were partly offset by increased interest
charges of Pounds 2.02m (Pounds 1.24m) reflecting acquisition payments made
in May last year. Following the rights issue at the end of April net
borrowings fell to Pounds 18m (Pounds 37m), equivalent to gearing of 11.2
per cent.
COMMENT
The new management team is beginning to deliver the margin and profit
improvements that Low &amp; Bonar needed. Costs, including the headcount, are
being cut and the North American operations have been turned around. The
acquisition last month of CMB Carton Systems for Pounds 17.35m has
introduced leading packaging systems technology into the carton division
which is now underpinned by a five-year supply contract with Kellogg.
Analysts were raising their profit forecasts yesterday and profits before
tax could reach Pounds 31m this year, producing earnings of 20.8p per share
and a prospective multiple of 16.6. The share price has been rising, but
could still go higher.

FT  13 JUL 93 / International Company News: Avonmore buys Dairy Crest arm
for Pounds 20m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AVONMORE FOODS, the Irish dairy and meat group, has moved into fifth place
in the UK liquid milk market with the Pounds 20.5m purchase of two dairies
and 32 distribution depots from Dairy Crest, the milk and dairy products
side of the Milk Marketing Board.
The dairies are in Birmingham and Hereford, and mainly supply doorstep
deliveries. Avonmore is already strong in Birmingham and the West Midlands
and has a sizeable business with supermarkets in the area. It also wants to
expand in the south.
Dairy Crest is reconfiguring its milk capacity as a result of the falling
volume of milk sold on doorsteps and the shift to producing for
supermarkets. It has also completed its sale to Unigate of Marshfield Dairy
in Cardiff.
Mr Pat O'Neill, Avonmore group managing director, said the changes in the UK
milk industry, which will take place next year when the MMB is abolished,
presented Avonmore with an opportunity to use skills developed in Ireland
where the industry has been deregulated for over a century.
The acquisition will give Avonmore an extra 39m gallons of liquid milk
volume, taking its total to over 85m gallons, or 7 per cent of the UK liquid
milk market.
Avonmore also buys milk for cheese manufacture, and, with the liquid milk,
will buy a total of 130m gallons a year.
The businesses Avonmore is buying have net assets of Pounds 19.7m, and make
annual sales of Pounds 87m and pre-tax profits of Pounds 4.6m. Avonmore is
paying Pounds 10m on completion with a further Pounds 10.5m next January. Mr
O'Neill said the group's cash flow would cover the consideration without
raising gearing, currently 65 per cent.
Avonmore said the integration of two dairies in Wiltshire and Hampshire
acquired last November was proceeding to plan.
Avonmore shares rose 7p to 150p.

FT  13 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Monarch sees upturn from Revemin plant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR MICHAEL Beckett, chairman of Monarch Resources, the London-quoted gold
company with activities in Venezuela, told the annual meeting that the
Revemin processing plant, which suffered a loss of Dollars 1.84m (Pounds
1.22m) last year, would return to 'significant profitability' after a new
hard-rock crushing plant began operating next month.
Mr Anthony Ciali, chief executive, said later that Monarch had located at
its Canaima concession 75,000 tonnes of hard rock containing 9.7 grams a
tonne, enough to keep Revemin going for a year, and for the first time
Monarch would 'be in charge of its own destiny for feed for Revemin.'
A special task force had been established to identify more high-grade, hard
rock feed resources for Revemin from the group's concession holdings and
from third parties.
Mr Beckett said he expected the second call of the recent rights issue to be
fully taken up. The 20p a unit second instalment, due by July 30, involved
holders paying a total of 66p a share compared with a recent market price of
180p.
This Dollars 10m net would help finance the La Camorra gold mine,
development of which was under budget and ahead of schedule.
He recalled that the mine, set to start up in June next year, would be one
of the world's lowest-cost gold producers with cash costs predicted to be
Dollars 115 a troy ounce.
With projected annual output of 86,000 tonnes for four years, La Camorra
would generate a great deal of cash - for a company of Monarch's size - to
be used for further projects in Venezuela and, possibly, Mexico and North
America.
Mr Ciali said Monarch's exploration expenditure would remain relatively high
this year at about Dollars 2.5m and be concentrated mainly in the La Camorra
area, where there was a good chance of more ore being discovered to lengthen
the life of the mine.

FT  13 JUL 93 / UK Company News: AG Barr hit by sugar price
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AG BARR, the soft drinks company which bills its best known product as being
made in Scotland from girders, was hit by high sugar prices in the half year
to May 1 and pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 3.05m to Pounds 2.1m.
Mr Robin Barr, chairman of the company which makes Irn-Bru and Tizer, said
that by February 1993 the fall in the value of the Green Pound, following
the UK's departure from the ERM in September, resulted in an 18 per cent
increase in the price of sugar.
He said the decline in profits was exacerbated because comparative figures
included a Pounds 409,000 surplus on the sale of the investment in
Taverners, a confectionery company.
Group turnover fell to Pounds 42m (Pounds 42.4m), an increase in sales of
Barr's brands being offset by a decrease of retailers' own label products.
Mr Barr said turnover in the nine weeks since May 1 had been well below last
year, when the weather was exceptionally favourable. The 'better spell of
weather' recently was encouraging, he added.
Operating profits fell to Pounds 2.49m (Pounds 3.27m) and interest charges
dropped to Pounds 389,000 (Pounds 624,000).
Mr Barr said: 'We borrowed less money. We did borrow money from the bank
some five years ago to fund an acquisition. We are always cash generative
each year and we have gradually paid the bank loan.'
The interim dividend is maintained at 1.75p payable from reduced earnings of
7.67p (10.74p) per share.

FT  13 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Reject Shop shows 49% decline
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE REJECT Shop announced a profits fall of 49 per cent and a dividend cut
of 52 per cent for 1992-93, and warned that trading circumstances
surrounding its sector were likely to continue into 1994.
The company felt that its market, consisting of 18-35 year old customers
predominantly from the south-east, had been more affected by recession than
others.
For the year to March 21, pre-tax profit came to Pounds 346,000 (Pounds
652,000) and earnings per share worked through at 2.52p (4.47p). The final
dividend is cut to 1p for a total of 1.5p (3.15p).
Turnover rose to Pounds 22m (Pounds 20.7m) through new store openings.
Action had been taken to market more positively the company's products with
the introduction of a furniture catalogue and other initiatives.
There had been some growth in London, a substantial increase in sales of
some furniture ranges, and a higher take up of credit.

'We have a clear strategy for growth and during the next few weeks we will

Waterglade wants an extraordinary meeting, yet to be fixed, to seek the
removal from the Seafield board of Mr Chilver, Mr David Burke, and Mr David
Stacey. In their places it proposes Mr David Cunningham, Mr Thomas Megas, Mr
Peter Voller, and Mr David Grove, all directors of Waterglade.
Mr Chilver felt 'very uneasy at these underhanded attempts to gain control
of companies without making a cash bid.
'Waterglade's directors should be clear - Seafield will be no push over'.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BORDER Television, the Carlisle-based ITV company, reported profits of
Pounds 1.25m pre-tax for the 12 months to April 30 - a rise of just over 2
per cent on the comparable Pounds 1.22m. Turnover fell from Pounds 11.8m to
Pounds 11m.
The outcome, however, was struck after exceptional charges of Pounds 501,000
related to redundancies; profits at the operating level showed a 44 per cent
jump to Pounds 1.75m.
Mr Melvyn Bragg, chairman, said that while the early weeks of the current
year matched the previous period, 'there are signs that the economy has
stabilised which leads to an expectation of real growth in the second half'.
A recommended final dividend of 2p brings the total for the year to 3.3p
(2.7p), covered 2.5 times by earnings of 8.3p (7.6p).

FT  13 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Ellis &amp; Everard declines 3% and warns of
price pressure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ELLIS &amp; Everard, the chemicals distributor, yesterday warned of continuing
pressure on prices as it announced a 3 per cent fall in pre-tax profits for
the year to April 30.
Mr Peter Wood, chief executive, said: 'There is a lot of pressure on pricing
which is in the hands of the manufacturers.'
Profits fell from Pounds 12.6m - before exceptional losses of Pounds 9.6m -
to Pounds 12.2m after reduction and rationalisation costs of Pounds 1.4m
(Pounds 1m). Group sales rose to Pounds 394.6m (Pounds 383.4m).
The departure of the former chairman Mr Michael Marshall accounted for
Pounds 350,000 of the costs; the rest was divided between redundancy
payments - 300 jobs were shed - and rationalisation expenses.
Turnover in the UK increased to Pounds 145.2m (Pounds 133.1m) and operating
profit was up 1 per cent to Pounds 9.6m.
In the US, sales rose from Dollars 339.7m to Dollars 352.4m (Pounds 235m)
and operating profit increased by 13 per cent to Dollars 9.9m as the number
of operating sites was cut by seven to 30.
European sales fell to Pounds 33.3m (Pounds 40.3m) showing breakeven at the
operating level. The pool division, which makes and supplies accessories and
chemicals for swimming pools, was still in loss. The Spanish operation also
recorded a loss and was merged with Cat, a Spanish distributor.
Borrowing remain static at Pounds 9.1m, representing 13 per cent of
shareholders' funds.
Earnings per share fell to 10.3p (11.5p adjusted for the exceptional items).
The final dividend is maintained at 4.8p, making an unchanged 7.05p.
COMMENT
The price recovery longed for by Ellis &amp; Everard is unlikely to materialise
in the short term. US chemical prices, which fell by a further 5 per cent
over the last year, show no signs of improvement. As a distributor the
company can only look on as the manufacturers battle it out. At least volume
gains suggest that customers and suppliers are making increasing use of
distributors. By facing up to a number of problems nearer to home, such as
the loss-making pool side and the Spanish operation, it will be in a
stronger position to produce better figures next year. Analysts expect full
year pre-tax profits of Pounds 14.5m, which put the shares - down 2p to 209p
 -on a prospective multiple of 17.4. That still looks too demanding against
the market sector average of 14.5.

FT  13 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Virgin claims BA incentives unfair
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR RICHARD Branson, chairman of Virgin Atlantic Airways, yesterday accused
British Airways of more dirty tricks, including offering unfair incentives
to travel agents to push BA at the expense of other carriers, writes Daniel
Green.
Mr Branson has complained to the European Commission, alleging that BA
offers large corporations and travel agents financial incentives which
contravene EC competition laws.
'Some travel agency staff are sometimes encouraged to offer products which
are neither the best quality nor value for their customer . . . to reach (a)
target,' Mr Branson said. Upon achieving that target the agent would be paid
a 'kick back'.
BA said it would not be appropriate to comment. It was 'not aware of the
details of the allegations, nor have we been contacted by the EC'. The
complaint to the EC follows a series of actions by Virgin.

FT  13 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Menzies 'a step more than satisfactory'
with Pounds 30m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RESULTS of John Menzies for the year to May 1 were 'just that step more than
satisfactory', Mr Ranald Noel-Paton, group managing director of the retail
and wholesale group, said yesterday.
Pre-tax profits under FRS 3 jumped 85 per cent from Pounds 30.7m to Pounds
16.6m, reflecting heavy restructuring costs a year earlier. Mr Noel-Paton
said pre-tax profits from continuing operations under previous accounting
standards grew at a more modest 17 per cent to Pounds 30.1m (Pounds 25.7m).
Turnover was Pounds 1.17bn (Pounds 1.1bn).
Distribution services drove the profits advance with a rise from Pounds
18.5m to Pounds 20.9m at the operating level on turnover ahead at Pounds
768.1m (Pounds 705.5m). Mr Noel-Paton expected the MMC investigation into
news wholesaling to be published about September.
Sales volumes and profits fell at TBD largely because of poor demand for
music. Total Book Distribution, now folded into TBD, saw book sales rise 10
per cent. On a like-for-like basis Universal Office Supplies lifted sales 12
per cent, though including the acquired RMG they rose 22-23 per cent.
Operating profits on the retailing side slid to Pounds 11.1m (Pounds 11.3m)
on increased turnover of Pounds 375.7m (Pounds 356.2m). Here progress at
Early Learning Centre, where sales were up 12 per cent and profits 'almost
in proportion to sales', was offset by a 'slight' profits fall and 3.5 per
cent sales growth at John Menzies Retail.
Mr Noel-Paton said the 156 non-confectionery/tobacco/newspapers and
non-station bookstall outlets in the 274-strong chain were to be revamped
away from a generalist to a multi-specialist approach.
Cash flow was a bright point, enabling borrowings to be reduced by Pounds
16m to about Pounds 8m, said Mr Noel-Paton. Consequently interest charges
tumbled to Pounds 1.9m (Pounds 4.1m).
FRS 3 earnings leaped to 35.3p (15.5p) and continuing earnings to 34.6p
(28.4p) per share. The annual dividend is lifted to 10.8p (10p) with a 7p
final.
COMMENT
Thought of as solid, rather than adventurous, Menzies' management has at
last grasped the nettle at JM Retail, installing a new managing director
with a brief to give it an identity on the high street. To help with this,
capital expenditure is expected to rise from Pounds 15.5m this time to
Pounds 20m. However, the chain operates in a dull market - especially
newspapers and music - and the scope for improvement may be narrow. The
wholesale side remains impressive, illustrated by the - admittedly
acquisition-driven - 20 per cent sales growth at UOS in a tricky market. The
unknown quantity is the outcome and fall-out of the MMC report, though it's
likely to be neutral or worse. Assuming about Pounds 32m pre-tax pencilled
in for the current year, the group is on a prospective p/e of 13.9. The
shares are near the sector rating and perhaps have run ahead of themselves.

FT  13 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Smith's creditors mount challenge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CREDITORS of Mr Clive Smith, the Midlands entrepreneur who recently avoided
bankruptcy after incurring debts of more than Pounds 20m, are mounting a
challenge to the individual voluntary arrangement which allows him to repay
just 8.13p in the pound.
Their appeal will be based on a clause in the insolvency act which allows
court intervention if material irregularities at or in relation to a
creditors meeting could be proved. The hearing is set for August.
The challenge follows the creditors' meeting last month at which a majority
of the debt was voted in favour of Mr Smith's proposals. However, disputing
creditors are thought to be raising questions over the validity of debt
claims from an offshore company linked to an associate of Mr Smith.
Richard Pearce &amp; Sons, a Hong Kong-based company with an Irish address, is
Mr Smith's largest creditor, with claims of Pounds 12.3m. Mr Kelvin Myles,
who shares the same Irish address and has managed many of Mr Smith's
offshore interests, has refused to identify Richard Pearce's owners to other
creditors.
At the creditors meeting last month Mr Smith denied he had any connection to
Richard Pearce. The proxy vote in favour of the IVA was cast by Mr Graham
Wilson, Mr Smith's insolvency practitioner. Mr Wilson, who was arrested last
year on suspicion of defrauding creditors in an insolvency procedure, is
currently on police bail awaiting possible charges.
Mr Smith's creditors include the Inland Revenue, owed Pounds 1.3m, Societe
Bancaire de Paris, Pounds 1.5m, and accountants Moore Stevens with Pounds
199,935. Creditors also include Mr Robert Pollock, the former chairman of
Alpine Double Glazing, whose mortgage was guaranteed by Mr Smith's family
vehicle, Finchley Investments.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Bolstered by a Pounds 2.53m surplus on the disposal of a subsidiary, pre-tax
profits of Daejan Holdings, the property group, rose by Pounds 2.8m to
Pounds 16.7m in the year to end-March.
Gross income for the year increased from Pounds 22.1m to Pounds 23m, and at
the operating level profits from continuing operations improved to Pounds
18.5m against Pounds 18.2m.
The accounts have been prepared on an FRS 3 basis.
The interest charge rose to Pounds 5.06m (Pounds 4.35m) and tax took Pounds
3.5m (Pounds 5.32m).
The company said that the UK investment portfolio had been professionally
valued at the year-end and the resultant decrease of Pounds 1.1m had been
incorporated into the accounts.
A final dividend of 15p (13p) is proposed for a 27p (25p) total.
The dividend is three times covered by earnings per share of 81p.

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TOMKINS, which reported pre-tax profits up 29 per cent to Pounds 171m
yesterday, has always said its aim is to produce above average increases in
earnings per share.
Yesterday, on cue, it showed a 4 per cent rise compared with a UK average
decrease of 3.8 per cent and, for good measure, a 21 per cent lift in the
dividend, compared with a UK average fall of 7.6 per cent.
But rather than welcome the news, the market promptly clipped 5 per cent off
the share price.
For some time Mr Greg Hutchings, chief executive, has been able to rely on
his track record and exhortations to 'trust us'.
While this record has indeed been impressive, investors who dipped deep in
their pockets to fund the Pounds 935m RHM acquisition appear disappointed
they have been given so little ammunition with which to judge for themselves
Tomkins' prospects - at RHM and at the existing businesses.
The first disappointment revolves around Tomkins' failure to produce a
figure for fair market adjustments at RHM, seven months after the company
was acquired.
Mr Ian Duncan, finance director, provided half an answer yesterday. While
praising the calibre of the accountants at RHM, he said the reporting
systems were inadequate. The extent of the fair value provisions will, in
any case, be resolved with six weeks when the accounts are published.
Nor has Tomkins set down any milestones in the reorganisation of RHM,
against which the outside world can judge Mr Hutchings and his team.
Analysts said this might be a result of caution, but when a business is as
closely followed as the milling and baking industry is in the UK, the
absence of a clearly spelled out strategy for reorganisation is likely to
lead to unease.
At the operational level in the existing businesses, the company is little
more specific about the last year or prospects.
Operating margins in the non-RHM business slipped slightly to 9 per cent
last year with margins down in three of the four divisions. Fluid controls,
services to industry and professional, garden and leisure products saw
reduced margins.
Margins were under pressure in the UK and the US to varying degrees, and
Tomkins said it has seen no strong evidence yet of a recovery of industrial
or consumer confidence.
The industrial products division improved margins from a strong base on
strongly increased sales - up 23 per cent - as the group benefited from
operational gearing born of investing in low cost production during the
recession.
Mr Hutchings has identified his main product as financial performance. With
the share price under some pressure, holders are sending a clear signal that
they want to know more about how that performance is to be achieved.

FT  13 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Dirty tricks cloud the horizon - The issues
raising a storm at British Airways' AGM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LORD KING of Wartnaby will have a front row seat today to see Sir Colin
Marshall, his successor as chairman of British Airways, defend the airline
publicly against allegations of 'dirty tricks' on Virgin Atlantic Airways.
In his first British Airways annual meeting as merely a VIP he will expect a
spirited performance from his protege.
He should not be disappointed. Sir Colin will make his account of the Virgin
affair a central plank of his speech to the 1,000-plus shareholders crammed
into London's Barbican Centre.
But Sir Colin's task will not be made easier by some carefully planned
questions from the floor. The company has received questions from more than
2,000 shareholders, one third of which relate to the Virgin affair.
Although BA has already apologised to Virgin for the campaign, which
involved the misuse of computer information on Virgin's passengers - and
paid Pounds 600,000 to the airline - it faces further legal action in the UK
and Brussels.
BA's board has denied involvement in this misuse of passenger information,
which was said to have been carried out by junior staff.
However its position may be attacked by questions from Mr Brian Basham, who
was sacked at the start of the year as public relations adviser to British
Airways for his part in the dirty tricks campaign.
Mr Basham has submitted four questions to be answered at the annual meeting.
In a letter to Sir Colin detailing the questions, he says: 'it remains
entirely implausible to me . . . that you could not have known' of the
misuse of computer data.
Mr Basham has sent copies of this letter to institutional investors in the
airline and outlined further charges against Sir Colin.
Such accusations are likely to distract from what should have been a
triumphant debut for the new chairman.
While almost every airline in the world has struggled against recession and
overcapacity, the past year has seen BA consolidate its position as the
western world's most profitable airline. Sir Colin has taken advantage of
this financial strength to push ahead with a plan to create the world's
first global airline.
Since the last annual meeting, BA has taken a Pounds 198m stake in USAir,
and paid Pounds 304m for 25 per cent of Qantas, the Australian carrier. It
has bought into TAT, the French regional carrier, into Delta, a German
airline, and taken over the loss-making operations of Dan-Air, the UK
carrier based at London's Gatwick airport.
To pay for it all, BA successfully raised Pounds 442m from its shareholders
in a rights issue.
On the industrial relations front, the company has overcome strikes by some
of its staff with apparently little lasting damage.
Sir Colin has also begun to impose his own personality on the business
shaped by Lord King, who took it from a mediocre state-owned enterprise into
one admired by the world's airline entrepreneurs.
Since Lord King left the board in March, allowing Sir Colin to move up from
chief executive, two new independent non-executive directors have been
appointed. They are Baroness O'Cathain, the managing director of the
Barbican Centre, and Mr Charles Mackay, chief executive of Inchcape.
With these changes, the British Airways that Lord King constructed during
his 11 years in power is beginning to change.
But one feature of the company that may not be so easy to alter is the
liveliness, even rowdiness, of the airline's annual meetings.
Lord King thrived in those meetings, becoming known for his brusque and
often witty control of questioners.
The quieter Sir Colin may have cause today to search for a similar fund of
stage skills.

FT  13 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Sema sells stake in subsidiary
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SEMA GROUP, the Anglo-French computing services company which is quoted in
London, has sold a 24.5 per cent interest in Sema Group Facilities
Management, its UK-based outsourcing arm, to FT LIS - a wholly owned
subsidiary of France Telecom - for Pounds 8.77m.
The sale is being arranged through the creation of a UK joint venture
company in which Sema and FT LIS will have equal shares and which will own
49 per cent of SGFM.
Sema, which has built up a strong position in the fast expanding UK market
for facilities management, will retain ownership of 75.5 per cent of the
subsidiary.
The facilities management operations made pre-tax profits of Pounds 3.7m in
the year to end-December and had net assets of Pounds 2.61m.
The move was welcomed in the market yesterday where Sema's share price
gained 10p to close at 371p. Sema said it will use the proceeds of the sale
for further development of its activities.
The UK joint venture represents the latest in a growing number of links
between Sema, which wants to expand its communications related operations,
and the French telecommunications group, which is eager to develop its
international business.
In October FT LIS acquired an indirect stake in Sema after it established a
joint venture company with Paribas to hold the French bank's 39 per cent
shareholding in Sema. France Telecom owns a 49.9 per cent stake in the
holding company.
Following that agreement Mr Charles Rozmaryn, head of France Telecom, and Mr
Michel Huet, head of FT LIS, joined the Sema board.

FT  13 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Spring Ram chief awaits fate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The fate of Mr Bill Rooney, chairman and chief executive of Spring Ram, is
likely to be decided at a board meeting of the bathroom and kitchens group
tomorrow
Prudential Corporation, the group's biggest institutional shareholder, wants
to see the departure of Mr Rooney, who yesterday returned early from a
holiday in Barbados to fight for his future in the company, which he
co-founded.
Sources close to the company suggested that the other executive directors
would not wish to work with an imposed chairman, but the Prudential seems
confident that its views will prevail.
Spring Ram's shares yesterday closed 5 1/2 p higher at 54p, well below last
year's peak of 181p.
The shares have collapsed because of three profits warnings in eight months,
the most recent a fortnight ago.

FT  13 JUL 93 / Intel's second quarter yields record results
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INTEL, the world's largest maker of computer chips, yesterday reported
record revenue and earnings for the second quarter. It said it had shipped
more than 10,000 Pentium chips, its new high performance microprocessor.
Revenue for the second quarter rose 61 per cent to Dollars 2.13bn (Pounds
1.4bn) from Dollars 1.32bn in the same period last year. Net income was up
167 per cent at Dollars 569m, or Dollars 1.30 per share, compared with
Dollars 213m or 50 cents per share in last year's second quarter.
Earnings were in line with Wall Street expectations, but failed to reach the
highest estimates. Intel's share price fell slightly yesterday to Dollars 55
1/2 at midday, down from a Friday close of Dollars 56.
'We had an excellent quarter. Intel486 microprocessor volume continued to
expand and shipments of Pentium processor-based systems began,' said Mr
Andrew Grove, president and chief executive.
For the first six months of 1993, Intel's revenues rose 62 per cent to
Dollars 4.15bn, from Dollars 2.56bn last year. Net income surged 181 per
cent to Dollars 1.12bn or Dollars 2.53 per share, versus Dollars 397m or 93
cents per share.
First half earnings exceeded the Dollars 1.07bn the company earned for the
whole of 1992. Per-share earnings were restated to reflect a 2-for-1 stock
split in May, 1993.

FT  13 JUL 93 / Boardroom symptoms of a sectoral malaise: The pressure
building up on the world's drugs groups
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THREE of the world's top six drugs companies have lost their president or
chief executive since March. The boardroom bust-ups are a symptom of
disarray in the pharmaceuticals industry over how to respond to the rapidly
changing healthcare environment.
The reasons for Mr Richard Markham's departure from Merck &amp; Co, the world's
biggest drugs group, are still being debated. But the other two
resignations, that of Mr Ernest Mario as chief executive of Glaxo, the
world's second largest group, and Mr Vaughn Bryson as chief executive of Eli
Lilly were clearly the result of differences within the board over the
companies' future direction.
The cause of the drugs groups' difficulties is a combination of healthcare
reform in Europe and Japan, and changes in the customer base in the US, the
world's largest market, where an increasing number of clients are demanding
ever greater discounts.
Mr Hans Joachim Langmann, chairman of E. Merck, the privately owned German
group, has lamented: 'The world is falling apart' for drugs manufacturers.
Reforms launched in Germany, the world's fourth largest market, led to an 11
per cent collapse in sales in the first four months of this year, according
to IMS International, the market research group. Overall, growth in the
European market has slowed to 1.4 per cent, compared with 8 per cent during
1992.
In the US, the changes taking place among drugs companies' customers are
probably more significant than the reforms being prepared by Mrs Hillary
Rodham Clinton and her healthcare taskforce.
Employers and individuals are grouping together to buy their healthcare in
bulk. The bulk providers, which include Medicare and Medicaid, the state
programmes for the old and poor, health maintenance organisations (HMOs) and
mail order companies, are much more cost-orientated than traditional
insurers. Known as 'managed' organisations, they are less interested in the
relative merits of drugs than their price and are able to play one drug
manufacturer off against another, negotiating substantial discounts.
Figures compiled by The Boston Consulting Group suggest the growth of the
managed sector has been explosive, increasing from 20 per cent of the
non-hospital drugs market in 1987 to 35 per cent last year. Merck reckons
that by the end of the decade 90 per cent of its American pharmaceuticals
sales will be to bulk buyers. At present the figure is about 60 per cent.
More alarmingly for the drugs groups, the size of the discounts the managed
groups can negotiate has increased from 10 per cent to 25 per cent in the
past five years. Merck has been affected by discounting more than most. Its
best selling products, heart drugs and antibiotics, all suffer from price
competition.
The net effect of the changes in the US and Europe has been tumbling volumes
and prices. As a result, brokers Wertheim Schroder reckon the average
profits growth rate in the industry will fall from 19 per cent in the late
1980s to about 8 per cent this year. Some companies will suffer a decline.
Faced with such a rapidly changing environment, drugs company boards need to
make some tricky decisions about how their organisations should adapt. It is
these decisions that appear to be causing the friction in senior management.
The implications of the deteriorating market are frightening. First, the
groups must find alternative strategies to cope with the changing US
customer base.
Second, they must decide whether to remain pure pharmaceuticals groups, or
use their scientific base to become healthcare companies. They would offer
diagnostics and over-the-counter (OTC) medicines which are less profitable
than prescription products, but generate more stable earnings.
In the US, the adjustment to managed care will be painful. Many of the
thousands of sales representatives, who used to convince doctors about a
particular medicine's effectiveness, may be made redundant. Schering'Plough
of the US reckons a third of its sales are though managed care schemes, but
require only 60 salesmen. A further 1,600 sales staff are required for the
other two-thirds.
One analyst estimates there could be between 50,000 and 100,000 job losses
in the industry over the next few years, saving the sector Dollars 5bn
(Pounds 3.3bn) a year.
Meanwhile, the debate within the pharmaceuticals groups about alternative
strategies continues. Merck has announced it will take the unprecedented
step of manufacturing generic non-patented products once its medicines'
patents expire. It has also formed an alliance with the consumer group
Johnson &amp; Johnson to market OTC products.
The irony is that many drugs groups spent the 1980s becoming pure
prescription medicine companies, disposing of their OTC and consumer brands
businesses. The sacking of Mr Mario at Glaxo may have been partly caused by
the reluctance of the board to reverse the company's policy of exiting from
OTC medicines.
With no sign of the external pressures ameliorating, more boardroom ructions
are undoubtedly in the pipeline.

FT  13 JUL 93 / MFI sweetens the pill of a 39% decline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MFI, the furniture group, sent a mixed message to the City yesterday,
reporting a 39 per cent fall in pro forma pre-tax profits to Pounds 40.2m
because of disappointing sales, but giving an upbeat statement on current
trading.
It was the company's first full-year results presentation since its
flotation last July. The shares gained 1 1/2 p to close at 128 1/2 p.
'We are trading 3 per cent ahead, but 11 weeks is nowhere near a trend, and
we are still cautious,' said Mr Derek Hunt, chairman.
Turnover for the year to April 24 fell 6.7 per cent to Pounds 603.9m.
Mr John Randall, finance director, said trading had been particularly
disappointing during the 10-week new year sale, when MFI makes about a third
of its turnover.
While this partly reflected lower levels of activity in the housing market,
he admitted MFI had made mistakes in its promotional campaigns which led to
competitors stealing market share. MFI had since adjusted some prices and
revamped its advertising.
Sales suffered most in kitchens and bedrooms, which carry a higher profit
margin because MFI manufactures them itself. Gross margins fell 1.7 points
to 57.4 per cent because of the unfavourable sales mix and exchange rate
movements.
But Mr Randall said the company's progress in cutting costs made it
optimistic it could increase profits next year, even if the economic upturn
was weak.
MFI has reduced overheads by 7.2 per cent through cutting staff by 800,
investing in new systems, reducing stockholding and purchasing freeholds on
four previously leasehold properties.
Surplus space in some stores has been sub-let, leading to lower costs and
rental income for the year of Pounds 7.2m.
Mr Randall said at least another 100,000 sq ft of surplus space would be
leased out in the current year, taking rental income to Pounds 8.5m.
Analysts expect costs to fall further this year, and based on an improvement
in sales of 3 or 4 per cent are forecasting pre-tax profits of Pounds 60m to
Pounds 65m this year.
Proceeds from the flotation allowed MFI to redeem its preference shares and
reduce borrowings to Pounds 62m, taking gearing from 80 per cent to 52 per
cent. Since the year-end, the company has received Pounds 21m from the sale
of its 20 per cent stake in Carpetright, which was floated last month.
Pro forma earnings were 4.5p (7.4p). The final dividend was held at 2.5p,
making a total of 3.75p.

FT  13 JUL 93 / Japanese banks halt lending to troubled property group
</HEADLINE>

FIVE leading Japanese banks yesterday said they would halt lending to EIE
International, a property developer weighed down by Y700bn (Pounds 4.3bn) in
debts.
Japanese banks have traditionally been reluctant to cut their lifelines to
debt-stricken corporate customers. But the EIE case could mark a tougher
approach, as the banks write off a pile of non-performing property loans.
EIE owns hotel resorts and office buildings in the UK, the US, Australia and
south-east Asia. Its break with the banks came after a dispute with the
Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan, which has Y190bn in loans outstanding to the
company, about half defined as 'bad'. LTCB said any loan losses would be
covered through the sale of its long-term holdings of shares. The bank said
the decision to confront the bad debts was taken in the interests of
'financial soundness'.
The removal of LTCB's support sends a clear signal to other banks that it
will no longer be responsible for EIE debts and raises questions about how
the EIE group will service its debts.
Trading in two affiliates of the unlisted EIE International was suspended
yesterday. Sea-Com, a shipping and resort company, is listed on the second
section of the Tokyo exchange while Electronic and Industrial Enterprises,
an electronics supplier, is traded on the over-the-counter market.
Mr Harunori Takahashi, president of EIE reassured staff that the company
would continue trading. LTCB said it would not immediately cut links to the
two listed affiliates.
EIE group and its bankers, LTCB, Mitsui Trust and Banking, Mitsubishi Trust
and Banking, Sumitomo Trust and Banking and Nippon Credit Bank, have been
renegotiating a restructuring package.
The banks say the developer was unwilling to accept terms, which included a
quickening of property disposals.
The extent of the break with LTCB can be gauged by the fact that the bank
has recalled five managers sent in to underpin the property developer.
LTCB said the worsening of the international property market and the
appreciation of the yen, which cut the value of foreign holdings, had
undermined the chances of a successful bank-sponsored restructuring.

FT  13 JUL 93 / Tomkins shares fall despite raised dividend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TOMKINS, the conglomerate which in December bought Ranks Hovis McDougall,
the milling and baking company, increased earnings per share by 4 per cent
last year but showed it has yet to convince investors of the merit of the
acquisition.
Reporting a year that demonstrated little consumer or industrial recovery in
the UK or the US, Tomkins said pre-tax profits rose 29 per cent at Pounds
171.0m, on sales up 62 per cent at Pounds 2.06bn.
Mr Greg Hutchings, chief executive, said RHM had neither enhanced nor
diluted earnings in the period.
Fully diluted earnings per share rose from 12.74p to 13.26p. The group is
recommending a 4.545p final dividend - on a capital base enlarged to pay for
the RHM acquisition - to make a 6.35p total, up 21 per cent.
Although Tomkins' profits were in line with City expectations, the shares
shed 11.5p to close at 212.5p. The fall follows a 16 per cent
underperformance relative to the FT-All Share index since the start of the
year.
Mr Hutchings said it was not that institutional investors were criticising
the acquisition as being less than good, 'it's just that they are saying
'prove it'.'
Analysts said the share price fall reflected disappointment that Tomkins had
given no more information on the extent of asset write-downs at RHM. Nor had
the conglomerate produced evidence that RHM could be quickly turned around.
Tomkins said operating margins at RHM were marginally lower on an annualised
basis but that cost cutting measures this year should reverse the decline.
Mr Hutchings said that in spite of closing four bakeries, which had removed
about 8 per cent of baking capacity, RHM had not lost market share. 'There
is not significant overcapacity left' in baking, he said.
Tomkins finished the year with Pounds 120m of net cash. The group remained
strongly cash generative and saw scope for reducing working capital at RHM.
It did not see any signs of recovery in consumer or industrial confidence.
But its high operational gearing would enable it to benefit when its markets
did begin to grow strongly.

FT  13 JUL 93 / Probe widens as secret GM papers are found: Prosecutors look
for link to VW production head
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GERMAN prosecutors are looking for links between Volkswagen's controversial
new production director, Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, and secret
General Motors' documents found in a Wiesbaden apartment, according to legal
officials.
The investigation of the US group's claims that Mr Lopez and junior
colleagues took confidential information with them when they defected to VW
this spring took a new turn yesterday after confirmation from Adam Opel,
GM's German subsidiary, that the discovery included details of a top-secret
model it was planning.
It also emerged that Mr Jorge Alvarez Aguirre, who lived in the apartment
until recently, was formerly involved in Opel's new model policy through his
job as head of Opel's advance purchasing department.
Mr Alvarez was one of two Opel employees who switched to VW shortly after Mr
Lopez, head of global purchasing at GM, joined the German company in March.
A further five members of his US team also moved to VW at around the same
time.
'It is not only a question of the papers we found. We also have to see if
there is proof that Mr Lopez has anything to do with the matter,' Mr Georg
Nauth, spokesman for the Darmstadt prosecutor's office, said yesterday.
Interviews with VW and Opel employees were continuing, but the issues raised
by the Wiesbaden discovery made it 'hard to say' how long the investigation
would last, Mr Nauth said. There were many questions to be answered. For
example: 'If Mr Lopez had asked to see or saw the papers.'
Four boxes of documents had been discovered, 'which did not belong where
they were found', Mr Nauth added. He refused to confirm that they included
details of Opel's most important current project - a cheap mini-car
codenamed the O-car. But that was not to say reports to that effect were
wrong, he noted.
The O-car is due for launch in the second half of this decade. The concept
bears a striking resemblance to a projected 'people's car' announced since
Mr Lopez's arrival by Mr Ferdinand Piech, VW chairman.
Opel's plans for a super-lean works to make the vehicle, provisionally
earmarked for Hungary, also closely match those unveiled recently by Mr
Lopez for his homeland in the Basque country, northern Spain. Mr Lopez
played a leading role in developing Opel's project, and it was his
disappointment that it would not be built in Spain which led to him leaving
GM and being appointed head of production at VW.
VW, which last week stated that the Basque works would not be built 'at this
time', yesterday repeated its claim that none of the documents was secret. A
lawyer speaking for Mr Alvarez made a similar claim although he admitted he
had not seen the papers.

FT  13 JUL 93 / Producers strive to hold down prices as costs rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH manufacturers are holding down prices in an effort to rebuild sales,
in spite of paying more for materials and fuel.
Prices of factory-made goods for domestic sale rose 0.1 per cent during
June, according to figures released yesterday by the Central Statistical
Office. In the year to last month prices rose 4 per cent, the same as in the
year to May.
Materials and fuel purchased by manufacturers increased in price 7.8 per
cent in the 12 months to June, compared with 7.5 per cent in the year to
May. Seasonally adjusted, these prices rose 0.3 per cent during June.
The figures confirm that the fall in sterling since last September's
devaluation has yet to show up significantly in the prices that
manufacturers are charging at the wholesale level.
Manufactured goods excluding food, drink and tobacco - prices of which are
thought to show underlying inflationary pressures - also showed little
upward price movement in the past month.
These goods rose in price 0.1 per cent during June. The year-on-rise of 2.6
per cent was the same as in the year to May.
While the year-on-year increase in prices of all manufactured goods has
edged up from the 3.5 per cent recorded in December, the measure for
underlying inflation at the wholesale level has been fairly stable. It
registered 2.4 per cent in December and has stayed at 2.6 per cent since
February.
In the year to last month, prices of petroleum products purchased by
manufacturers increased 8.5 per cent. Prices of home-produced food rose 12.9
per cent and imported food 10.5 per cent. However these substantial
increases were offset by subdued rises in prices of metals and other
imported goods.
Following the devaluation, the year on year rise in prices of materials and
fuels bought by manufacturers reached a high of 8.4 per cent in March. Since
then, however, inflationary pressures on the input side have been relatively
muted. In April the year-on-year increase in these prices was 7.2 per cent.

Effective competition often involves doing what your competitors like least.
On that basis, Mr Rupert Murdoch has delivered a dirty dig at Mirror Group
Newspapers by launching a price war in the tabloid market. Just as MGN was
beginning to recover its poise, it now faces the prospect of a long and
bloody circulation war. Its knee-jerk response in cutting the Mirror's cover
price to 10p for a day may have been an effective spoiler but hardly
provides a sustainable long-term strategy. MGN's administrators now face a
far trickier task in working out how to dispose of their 54 per cent
holding.
The biggest loser, though, may be the Daily Star. The timing is especially
unfortunate given its parent, United Newspapers, is already having a rocky
ride persuading shareholders to back a Pounds 190m cash call. Nevertheless,
the muted response of United's share price is understandable. The Daily Star
is only a small part of United's business while its core middle market
newspapers are likely to emerge unscathed.
As for News International, it can well afford the probable loss of Pounds 1m
of revenue a week as it attempts to stimulate the Sun's flaccid sales. But
past industry experience has shown that low prices are no substitute for
editorial appeal.

FT  13 JUL 93 / The Lex Column: MFI
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MFI's board seems content to wring its hands and blame economic conditions
for the poor profits figures it turned in yesterday. That looks a little
thick since the management picked up Pounds 11m in bonuses for successfully
floating the company after a few weeks of improved trading in 1992.
Doubtless MFI's board has had to struggle with difficult trading conditions
over the past five years. But then, so has everybody else. Perhaps the bonus
was simply a reward for good timing.
MFI argues that devaluation had a disastrous impact on its business, yet
interest rates are now four percentage points lower than at flotation and
there are faint stirrings in the housing market. The dilapidated home
improvement business would surely be a wasteland if sterling were still in
the ERM and interest rates 10 per cent. The exit from the management buy-out
thus leaves something of a nasty taste in the mouth.
There are also reasons to be sceptical about the company's much-vaunted
operational gearing. Consumers may be moving house a little more frequently,
but they are loath to spend money on high-margin kitchen units which cannot
easily be moved with them. Those tax increases already announced will hit
MFI's blue collar customer base particularly hard. The sag in sales and
margins which followed pressure from other DIY retailers earlier this year
is also worrying. Even the most optimistic profits estimates leave MFI at a
30 per cent premium to the market. On that basis the market's love affair
with recovery stocks is surely overdone.

FT  13 JUL 93 / The Lex Column: Merck
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The uncanny symmetry between Merck and Glaxo continues to impress. The
leading pharmaceutical companies in the US and Europe peaked against their
local markets within a fortnight of each other in January 1992, after a bull
run lasting the best part of a decade. Both shares have since fallen by 40
per cent. Now the unexpected resignation of Mr Richard Markham from Merck
mirrors that of Mr Ernest Mario from Glaxo in March. Both were appointed
over the heads of established candidates as heir apparent to a chairman
approaching retirement. Their departure throws wide open the question of
succession.
Without a full explanation, it is difficult to believe Mr Markham's decision
to bow out owes nothing to issues of strategy. A spate of management changes
elsewhere in the industry suggests more general pressures - the more
aggressive attitude of governments on drugs prices being a case in point.
Merck has so far made a reasonable fist of adapting to tougher conditions.
Its joint venture with Johnson &amp; Johnson in over-the-counter medicines dates
from 1989, for example, while Glaxo has yet to announce its plans in this
area.
That might explain the relaxed attitude of investors yesterday. But Merck
has yet to prove that it can bargain successfully with bulk buyers of
healthcare in the US. It remains to be seen whether the policy of
discounting to defend market share introduced by Mr Markham is carried
forward. Either way, Merck - like others in the industry - will remain under
pressure to cut costs in the interest of earnings growth, even if that means
management friction and the sacrifice of sacred cows.

FT  13 JUL 93 / The Lex Column: Hard grind for Tomkins
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Nine months after the acquisition of Ranks Hovis MacDougall, it is clearer
than ever that the deal will make or break Tomkins' reputation. The trouble
is the market has no firm feel which it will be, although a 5 per cent fall
in Tomkins' share price yesterday, following a bout of underperformance,
highlights its suspicions. If Tomkins can squeeze more value from RHM's
stodgy dough then both confidence and a premium rating will be restored.
That would enable the conglomerate to skip merrily on to new prey in a few
years' time. With net cash of Pounds 120m at the year-end and the ability to
milk yet more from its mature businesses, Tomkins should certainly have a
strong launchpad.
Yet worries about RHM may continue to undermine Tomkins' rating. The paucity
of detailed information about RHM's progress does little to dispel doubts.
Tomkins appears to have successfully managed the tricky task of maintaining
market share while cutting baking capacity by 7 per cent. Combined with a
surprising rise in market volumes, this has helped bring the supply-demand
balance closer to equilibrium. The shedding of 2,000 jobs will also bring
significant cost benefits. Still, judging by its thin contribution to
Tomkins' results, RHM had still not reached the bottom of its cycle when it
was bought. RHM's shareholders must be smiling at their good fortune.
So far, Tomkins' response to the doubters has been: trust us. The company's
fine financial record certainly commends it. But with Tomkins deriving
little uplift from its existing businesses, the market is right to suspend
judgment.

FT  13 JUL 93 / No takers for the available tickets: The government has so
far failed to attract private finance for public sector projects
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The involvement of private capital in public sector projects could harness
government and business together to build a new prosperity across Britain,
Mr John Major told a Confederation of British Industry conference in May.
The prime minister was referring to the private finance initiative launched
in last year's Autumn Statement, to encourage the use of private investment
for public projects. Mr Norman Lamont, the then chancellor, said the
initiative would mobilise the private sector 'to meet needs which have
traditionally been met only by the public sector'.
Yet eight months after the Autumn Statement, the government has yet to
announce a significant new public sector project which involves private
finance. There is disenchantment among industrialists and financiers, who
fear the initiative will run out of steam unless there is some early
progress.
The Autumn Statement promised several measures to encourage greater use of
private finance for public projects:
Joint ventures between the private and public sector were to be encouraged,
with the government offering concessionary loans, equity participation and
transfer of assets.
The Treasury would relax its accounting rules for leasing to allow greater
use of long-term leases. The private sector could then lease expensive
equipment to the health service, for example.
Financially free-standing projects that could cover costs by charging users
would be allowed, even though they could in theory be financed more cheaply
in the public sector. (In most cases, such projects would, in practice, be
unlikely to go ahead because of Treasury restrictions on public borrowing.)
There have been attempts to present projects such as the Heathrow Express
rail link as evidence of a new partnership between public and private
sector. However, this joint venture between the British Airports Authority
and British Rail was first mooted in 1988, long before last year's Autumn
Statement.
The environment department's contribution to the private finance initiative
has been to publish a list of urban development schemes seeking private
sector partners. These are similar to dozens of other inner-city
regeneration schemes in which public sector funds are used to prime the pump
for private sector development. Building business parks and housing estates
is hardly meeting 'needs which have traditionally been met only by the
public sector'.
And the Department of Health has relaxed the rules on leasing capital
equipment in the health service. But requirements that the Treasury
scrutinise half of all leases worth between Pounds 1m and Pounds 10m leave
the rules too inflexible to attract the private sector, according to Mr
Peter Jacobs, chief executive of Bupa, Britain's biggest private healthcare
group. The initiative is likely to collapse 'if the private sector keeps
facing blockages', Mr Jacobs warns.
Mr Howard Davies, director-general of the CBI, said recently the whole
initiative would be discredited 'unless real holes can be dug in the ground
pretty soon'.
Business people interested in the initiative complain that the Treasury is
itself uncertain about the sort of contribution the private sector could
make.
According to one banker who has been involved in several infrastructure
projects: 'The government does not understand how the private sector
operates, what it's looking for in an investment project and how to attract
investors.'
An executive involved in the leasing business says that 'the Treasury still
has a lot to learn. Its paper on leasing and risk transfer showed that they
do not understand how the industry works.' The transfer of risk from the
public to private sectors has been at the heart of the difficulties in
making the private finance initiative work. The Treasury insists that a
private sector company which builds a toll bridge, for example, must bear
the risk that tolls might be insufficient to cover the costs. If the
government accepts responsibility for bailing out the company, the project
counts as public expenditure under UK public accounting rules. The
Treasury's main - and understandable - concern is that raising private
finance to fund public expenditure should not be a form of additional
government borrowing.
The Treasury accepts that there should be some sharing of risk in joint
ventures. Its guidance for departments says that the legal agreements should
set out in 'specific and clear terms . . . so that the risk which each party
undertakes properly reflects a clearly agreed structure of risk and reward'.
But the more the risk is transferred out of the public sector, the higher
the return the private sector expects to earn. Keen though it is to see the
initiative succeed, the Treasury is uncomfortable with the idea of putting
sufficient public money into joint ventures to allow the private sector
partner to earn a return on capital of 20 per cent or more.
There are also disagreements over what sort of risks it is fair to transfer
to the private sector. The Treasury expects government departments to demand
the maximum transfer of risk to private sector partners: the partners are
concerned to minimise the risk as far as possible to those factors under
their control.
In transport projects, for example, the private sector should be expected to
take risks associated with design efficiency, cost and time overruns during
the construction phase, and the efficiency of operations, according to Mr
Peter Foy, senior partner at McKinsey, the management consultants.
In his role as chairman of the transport group of London First, a business
organisation set up to tackle London's problems, Mr Foy has identified a
number of risks that the group believes the government needs to assume in
joint transport ventures. These include responsibility for losses caused by
planning delays, changes in design of the project imposed by public bodies
and delays in getting legislative approval.
'Taking responsibility for these types of risk, which are clearly not within
the control of the private sector, would be unacceptable to shareholders,'
he says.
In between these two extremes lie grey areas, says Mr Foy, where the
government needs to help private sector operators manage revenue risks,
perhaps by guaranteeing a minimum income (and maybe sharing in excess
profits). It is in such areas that the greatest difficulties have been
encountered in forming joint ventures in which the Treasury can be satisfied
that risk has been substantially transferred to the private sector.
A second significant obstacle to private and public sector partnerships is
the Treasury requirement for competition for public sector contracts. This
is a long-standing requirement in public sector contracts as a means of
ensuring value for money, and fair competition.
However, the requirement can be a disincentive to companies coming up with
new or innovative proposals which, once adopted, must then go out to
competitive tender for implementation. A company which invests its own money
in devising a project could then find that a competitor wins the contract to
build it.
The government has promised to look into the intellectual property rights of
project proposals, so that the companies which develop them can be paid for
their efforts.
A better solution, according to one banker who is keen to participate in
joint ventures, would be for the government to make early progress on
creating a stream of joint projects which the private sector can bid for.
'If there are several similar projects coming up, companies will be prepared
to invest in a bid on the basis that they will win a contract sooner or
later,' he says. 'But with one-offs or occasional contracts, they are less
willing to risk their capital.'
And that is the nub of the government's problem in convincing the private
sector that it is serious about the private finance initiative. Unless it
can launch some joint venture projects soon, private partners will become
increasingly sceptical about its intentions. Dispelling the growing
scepticism requires early progress if the initiative is to succeed.
