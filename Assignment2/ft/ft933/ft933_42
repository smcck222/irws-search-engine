FT  13 JUL 93 / Personal View: Estonia draws up reformers' blueprint
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Dr LUCJA SWIATKOWSKI CANNON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Estonia has assumed the pioneer position among the post-Soviet republics in
implementing political and economic reforms. This is due to a large extent
to the political consensus among its citizens about the concept and pace of
reforms, as well as the determination of its current leadership to carry
them out. These reforms, started in 1989, were much accelerated after the
country regained its independence following the attempted Moscow coup of
1991.
A new democratic constitution was adopted in June 1992 and free
parliamentary elections were held in September. This resulted in the
formation of the majority centre-right coalition government. In order to
isolate itself from the economic chaos and inflation affecting Russia and
other post-Soviet republics, Estonia introduced in 1992 its own currency,
the kroon, pegged to the German D-Mark, and a stabilisation programme. This
was a great success. However, a severe drop in industrial production caused
by disruptions in inter-republic trade is threatening to overwhelm the
Estonian economy with bankruptcies and unemployment.
To deal with the issue, the Estonian government has made restructuring and
privatisation of state-owned enterprises its main task. So far, progress in
privatising large enterprises has been slow, about 30 per cent of services
and small enterprises have already been auctioned.
This spring, the Estonian government elaborated and then adopted in June a
new, comprehensive law to integrate and simplify privatisation. The
re-establishment of independence was legitimised by claiming continuity with
the prewar Republic of Estonia. In privatisation, this has meant a policy
based on restitution of property lost in 1940 after the country was
incorporated into the Soviet Union and on compensation for exploitation by
the Soviets.
To carry out the programme, an elaborate system of vouchers was instigated.
The restitution scheme attracted more than 200,000 claims, of which about 15
per cent have been resolved. Where it has been impractical to return
property in kind, compensation vouchers are issued to claimants. In
addition, 'work contribution' vouchers are given out, based on years of work
in Estonia between 1945 and 1991. These are interchangeable and can be used
in the privatisation of housing, land, collective farm implements and
state-owned enterprises, or redeemed for shares in the compensation fund.
While the voucher system has been implemented, commercial sales of property
are proceeding on a pilot basis, with the Estonian Privatisation Agency
having already sold 30 large, state-owned enterprises. This success bodes
well for Estonia because of the interest shown by foreign, mainly
Scandinavian and German, investors.
The aim of the new privatisation law is twofold. The first is to spell out
the principles for the integration of these two aspects of privatisation
policy: the use of citizen vouchers and commercial sales. A small percentage
of shares, determined individually for each company, will be reserved for
sale in exchange for citizen vouchers. The majority of shares will be sold
for cash to strategic investors, in the tender for sale of 52 state-owned
enterprises, announced in May.
The second central issue of this law is the creation of the State Property
Agency. This will combine separate small and large enterprise privatisation
operations and include a restructuring unit which will assume authority over
all state enterprises and direct efforts to prepare them for privatisation.
Separate laws deal with the privatisation of housing, and of collective
farms, three-quarters of which have been dismantled on the basis of resolved
restitution claims or leases based on anticipated restitution. Another law
creates a compensation fund, the shares of which can be obtained for
vouchers. These laws create the legislative framework for privatisation and
hopes are high for rapid progress.
Estonia is ahead, not only of the post-Soviet republics but also of some
east European countries, in its efforts to build a demo-cratic society and a
free market economy.
It has a democratic consensus on the direction of its reforms, a legitimate
government, a sound currency, and a credible economic transformation and
privatisation programme that aptly balances the needs of foreign investors
with the desire for participation and a sense of justice of the local
population. Fulfilment of its demonstrable promise could serve as a model to
others in the former Soviet Union who have to travel the difficult and
uncertain road of return from the communist system.
The author was between March and May 1993 an adviser on privatisation to
Liia Hanni, Estonia's deputy prime minister

FT  13 JUL 93 / Leading Article: US-Japan trade
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
WE AGREE,' declared last week's communique from the summit of the seven
leading industrial countries 'that no recourse should be made to initiatives
and arrangements that threaten to undermine the multilateral, open trading
system.' After uttering these fine words, the US and Japanese governments
promptly announced agreement on a new 'negotiating framework' to resolve the
bilateral issues that divide them. Communiques are often ignored, but their
promises usually last more than a few hours.
The framework does not, at least so far, either establish quantitative goals
for changes in Japanese macro-economic policy or lay down precise criteria
by which the opening of the Japanese economy can be assessed. The two agreed
aims are simply a reduction in Japan's current account surplus and the
opening of markets.
Talks on the latter are to be subdivided further into Japanese public
procurement, particularly of foreign computers, supercomputers, satellites,
medical technology and telecommunications; regulatory reform, which covers
financial services, insurance, the distribution network and competition
policy; 'other major sectors', particularly cars and car parts; economic
harmonisation, including intellectual property; and the monitoring of
agreements.
One question is whether the objectives make sense. The answer is that they
do so only up to a point. Faster growth in Japanese demand is desirable, for
example, but a smaller external surplus may well not be.
A second question is whether the 'objective criteria' the Japanese have
proposed as a way of assessing the openness of their markets will turn into
precise target, or not. Probably they will. Results-oriented trade would
then become managed trade.
A final question is whether these proposals are consistent with the summit's
declaration in favour of multilateralism. They are not, in at least three
respects: first, participants other than the US and Japan have been
excluded; second, the discussion is being conducted outside the purview of
the Gatt; finally, the agenda is dictated by specific US concerns.
Many in the US believe that their concerns are more legitimate than those of
other countries. They are mistaken. Judged by the ratio of their bilateral
deficits to their total trade with Japan, many countries have a bigger
problem, among them being Hong Kong, Taiwan and the European Community as a
whole.
Other countries should address their own demands to Tokyo. The US and Japan
would probably reply that they are not powerful enough for a seat at the
table, which would at least confirm the emptiness of the summit's
declaration in favour of multilateralism. But perhaps the two powers would
feel obliged to agree. Then the discussion would involve all of Japan's
trading partners, not just the US. This particular cartel needs to be broken
right now.

'Well, did he say anything about lending me a tin of red paint?'

FT  13 JUL 93 / Observer: Gone missing?
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It's hard to believe, but it sounds as if something rather important may be
missing from the new Battle of Britain memorial atop the white cliffs of
Dover.
The granite statue of a young pilot, which was unveiled last Friday with a
minimum of publicity by the Queen Mother, is meant to be a permanent tribute
to those who served in the most famous air battle of the Second World War.
Although it has taken some time to raise the money, there is no shortage of
big names on the Battle of Britain memorial trust notepaper. Robin
Leigh-Pemberton, who stepped down as governor of the Bank of England at the
start of the month, is patron, air chief marshall Sir Christopher
Foxley-Norris is president, and the trustees include defence minister
Jonathan Aitken and Lord Tebbitt, a former chairman of the Conservative
Party.
Hence it could be rather embarrassing for all involved if a couple of famous
names really have gone missing. According to one old airman who attended the
ceremony, squadron leader Boleslaw Drobinski, the badges of the 302 and 303
Polish squadrons are not among the 66 squadrons which decorate the memorial.
The 303 squadron, which Drobinski commanded, was probably the most famous of
all foreign squadrons serving with the RAF.
Hard to believe that such a high-falutin' lot could have committed quite
such a resounding faux-pas.

While police chiefs may prove easy pickings when it comes to stealing mobile
telephones, travelling locksmiths can be a tougher prospect.
Witness the one who had his phone nicked soon after being set up in business
by the Prince's Youth Business Trust.
Distraught at the loss, which cut him off from his main source of orders, he
used another phone to get through to his own number and begged for the
return of the instrument, offering Pounds 50 and no questions asked. The
line went dead.
But his wife had an idea. She called the number, asked the man who answered
if he was a locksmith, then on being told 'yes' said she'd lost the key to
her flat and would he come and help. After bidding the price up to Pounds
65, the man agreed.
When he arrived, the waiting police posse took him off to the lock-up.

Dyed-in-the-wool opponents of the Channel Tunnel will be happy to hear that
there will soon be one less reason to use it.
From September, it will no longer be necessary to cross into former enemy
territory to inspect the Bayeux tapestry because a rather good replica
resides much closer to home in Reading.
The Museum of Reading, which is soon to be reopened, is planning to show off
a 230ft Victorian replica of the famous eleventh-century tapestry recording
William the Conqueror's invasion of England in 1066. The replica, presented
to Reading a century ago by a patriotic alderman, is said to be a remarkably
good copy.
However, it suffers from one defect. The Victorian embroideresses made the
naked male warrior put on a pair of trunks and an overly-endowed stallion
was cut down to size and appears as a gelding.
If you want to see all the naughty bits, a trip across the channel will
still be necessary.

One person seems to have been overlooked in all the gossip about who will
take over the presidency of the European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development. Jacques de Larosiere, governor of the Bank of France, may be
the natural front runner in the eyes of the French government. But getting
the nod from Madame de Larosiere may be a different matter.
De Larosiere - due to retire from the Bank of France at the age of 65 next
year - would certainly have the gravitas Jacques Attali lacked, but his wife
may have other ideas. The owner of a chateau in Picardy, she played a strong
role in persuading her husband to return to France in 1987 from his post in
Washington as IMF managing director - a job he swapped with his countryman
Michel Camdessus.
However, central bankers do soldier on, so it would be odd if de Larosiere
didn't accept the London job, if offerred. In which case expect Jean Claude
Trichet, top man at the French Treasury, to get the Bank of France job.

FT  13 JUL 93 / Leading Article: Private pensions
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SHOULD Britain's state pensions be privatised?
If Mr Frank Field, the back-bench Labour MP, did not already know how
sensitive raising this topic would be, he found out at the weekend. The
Labour leadership immediately dismissed him as a maverick for proposing
radical reforms. Even Mr Peter Lilley, the Conservative social security
secretary, has not dared to question the state pension openly in his current
review of the welfare state, though he did welcome Mr Field's contribution
to the debate.
Mr Field is to be congratulated for airing the issue for three reasons.
First, the state pension is already below the poverty line and will become
increasingly inadequate as a basis for retirement since it is increased in
line with inflation rather than earnings. Second, the growth of occupational
pensions and other forms of savings means it is no longer necessary for the
state to provide pensions for all to combat poverty in old age. Third,
providing state pensions to all in the long run is probably unsustainable.
The current cost of over Pounds 30bn a year will rise inexorably as the
population ages.
Although this demographic time-bomb will not explode until early next
century, that is no excuse for putting off decisions. Since pensions schemes
cannot be reformed quickly, the sooner politicians debate alternatives the
better.
Any reform would, of course, face serious hurdles. The biggest would be to
find ways to encourage people to take out private pensions while at the same
time protecting those who were too poor to save for their old age.
Mr Field's solution is to make private provision compulsory and for the
government to contribute to the private pensions of those not in work.
Another solution could be to bribe people to opt-out of the state scheme by
reducing their National Insurance Contributions - the approach taken by the
government when it decided to phase-out the state earnings related pensions
scheme in the mid-1980s.
The main drawback with both approaches is that they could cost the exchequer
large sums of money in the short-run, with the full savings accruing only
after several decades.
A cheaper option would to announce that the state pension would gradually
wither on the vine. Such an approach would rely on people receiving a
sufficient motivation to save for their pensions from the generous
tax-reliefs that are available. Those who still did not save enough for a
minimum retirement income would be protected by a means-tested safety net.
There may be other, more attractive alternatives. But they will not be
devised and get the public hearing they need unless there is a full and open
debate on the subject. That debate should not be left to a few brave souls
like Mr Field. Front-bench politicians must join in.

FT  13 JUL 93 / Leading Article: Brinkmanship in Baghdad
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IF NOTHING else, President Saddam Hussein is consistent. Since the invasion
of Kuwait nearly three years ago, the Iraqi leader has persistently refused
to obey UN Security Council resolutions. Time and again he has challenged
the authority of the world body. On occasion defiance has been a prelude to
retreat but, when he has proved inflexible, the Gulf war allies have had,
jointly or individually, to consider a military response.
The justification for such a response under international law needs to be
fully demonstrable, because it is vital to act under the authority of the UN
and to maintain, so far as possible, the political cohesion of the
international alliance which was created to force Iraq out of Kuwait. That
legality and political cohesion were stretched beyond the limit by the US
missile strike on Iraqi intelligence headquarters in Baghdad last month. The
attack, in retaliation for an alleged plot to assassinate former President
George Bush, was justified by Washington under a country's right of defence
provided for by Article 51 of the UN Charter. Several of America's allies
expressed no more than 'understanding' for the raid. Others were deeply
sceptical about the reasoning behind it, sensing that it owed more to
President Clinton's domestic difficulties.
There should be fewer doubts at the UN or in Baghdad about the consequences
of the latest confrontation with the Iraqi leader. As part of its programme
to deny Iraq weapons of mass destruction, UN teams have sought to install
cameras at two missile testing sites south-west of the capital. Although,
under the terms of the ceasefire resolutions, Iraq was permitted to retain
missiles with a range of less than 90 miles, UN officials rightly suspect
that Iraq would use its test facilities to develop weapons with a longer
range. They want to make sure that Iraq has no such opportunity.
Iraq argues that by installing cameras the UN would be violating its
sovereignty and this action could be used subsequently as a pretext for
shutting down other factories used for industrial purposes. Neither argument
carries weight and by refusing to allow the remote-control cameras to be
introduced, Iraq only deepens suspicions about its intentions.
Unlike the American missile attack last month, the present confrontation is
limited to two sites and one issue. The buildings housing the Iraqi test
facilities are clearly grouped and the Iraqis know precisely what is
required of them. The permanent members of the Security Council might
reasonably argue that Saturday's refusal by Iraq even to allow inspectors to
seal the missile sites while negotiations continued provided justification
enough for military action.
Even so, they must be mindful of the need to explain and justify. Once that
is done, the responsibility of any subsequent military action belongs to
Saddam Hussein. He must learn to expect consistency from the UN.

FT  13 JUL 93 / The hole in our pocket: The chancellor's dilemma, an inside
view
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BILL ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Treasury expects to borrow Pounds 50bn this year. Yet only three years
ago, in his March 1990 Budget, then-Chancellor Major expected a balanced
budget for 1993-94 after giving away Pounds 3bn in tax cuts.
What has caused this rapid deterioration in the public finances and can it
be reversed?
Some blame excessive public spending ahead of the election. On this view,
the deficit will not be cured until what was given away then is clawed back
by further spending cuts.
Others claim the main problem is the recession, which pushes up social
security payments irresistibly while reducing tax receipts. On this view,
much of the deficit will melt away as the recovery gathers strength.
A third factor, less widely recognised, is an unexpected erosion of tax
revenues because of policy changes, such as the introduction of independent
taxation, new tax breaks for savings, and generous carry-back of losses for
corporation tax.
There is a lively debate among forecasters - including the Seven Wise Men
and the OECD - about the respective importance of these factors, on which
their policy recommendations depend. If the deficit is mainly due to the
recession, it will disappear in the upturn. If not, action must be taken to
correct it.
Unfortunately, you can only quantify the effect of the recession by
comparing the actual outturn with a hypothetical no-recession scenario.
That gets you straight into the world of economic models, the debate about
the underlying growth rate of the economy, and the extent to which output is
currently below trend. Economists differ sharply on these issues and about
the effect of output on tax and spending.
To avoid these problems, we can adopt a much simpler approach, which is to
compare the latest official revenue and spending projections for 1993-94
with those made in March 1990. That date was the last occasion on which the
government's fiscal plans showed the economy still on course for a balanced
budget in the medium term.
The comparison shows how much of the extra borrowing is due to extra
spending and how much reflects lost tax revenue. We can roughly quantify the
effect of the recession on tax revenues, even though we do not know the size
of the output gap, because we do know that we have lost nearly 5 per cent of
output compared with earlier plans. Since tax revenue depends, other things
being equal, on the level of output, that implies a 5 per cent loss of
revenue, worth some Pounds 11bn.
The remaining Pounds 13bn of lost revenue must be attributed to tax changes
that were not forecast in 1990.
On the spending side, we know that the social security budget bears the
brunt of the recession. If we assume that all the extra social security
spending (compared with previous plans) is due to the recession, we get a
rough idea of how much of the extra spending is recession-induced.
We find that planned social security spending for 1993-94 has been revised
upwards by Pounds 11bn since 1990. (Although the published 1990 spending
plans do not include a breakdown by spending department beyond 1992-93, we
can use the rate of growth of social security spending published in the 1991
plans to fill in the missing number.)
Since total public spending has been revised upwards by no less than Pounds
30bn, it is tempting to conclude that discretionary spending must have risen
by Pounds 19bn. However, this ignores a very important item of unavoidable
spending: the interest charges on past borrowing.
When public borrowing goes up, whether because of recession or because of
extra discretionary spending, debt interest charges also rise. The
deterioration in the public finances has brought about a sharp rise in the
government's outstanding debt, and hence in the interest accruing on it.
Strictly speaking, some of that in-crease should be scored as discretionary,
since it is past spending decisions as much as the recession that have
pushed up today's debt interest bill. On the other hand, the government has
no discretion about paying the bill today. When debt interest charges go up,
it is an irresistible claim on the public purse, just as it is when rising
unemployment pushes up social security claims.
Which brings us to the central issue. The whole point of trying to calculate
how much of the rise in borrowing has been due to the recession is to
estimate how much will be automatically reversed by economic recovery.
ln this context, it is immaterial why the extra debt interest charges have
arisen. The point is they are an extra charge on the public purse which is
both irresistible and, unlike social security spending, irreversible.
Compared with its March 1990 plans, the government will have Pounds 110bn of
extra debt by the end of this year. At today's interest rates, that is some
Pounds 8bn of extra public spending on debt interest charges.
These calculations, summarised below, are intended to cast light on two
issues: how we got into this mess; and how we might get out of it.
The figures suggest that our problems are two-fifths due to the recession,
one-fifth due to extra discretionary spending and one-fifth due to missing
tax revenue. The missing-fifth is the combined effect of all these factors
on the debt interest bill.
Getting the public finances back to the healthy state shown in the 1990
plans requires some Pounds 11bn of spending cuts and Pounds 13bn of tax
increases. But even that would not eliminate the residue of debt interest
charges resulting from a permanently higher national debt. Nor is it by any
means certain that all the recession-induced social security spending will
simply disappear in the upturn. The social security budget has tended to
ratchet upwards in the past, leaping ahead in recessions but not falling
back in the subsequent re-covery.
In the first Budget of 1993, Mr Norman Lamont proposed tax increases which
will raise an extra Pounds 10bn of revenue by 1995-96. Mr Clarke has hinted
that he may do more in the November Budget. So the problem of revenue
shortfall is being addressed. However, it cannot be right to tackle a
deficit which is partly caused by excessive spending simply by raising
taxes. Action is also needed on the spending side. Yet none has so far been
proposed. Why not? I shall try to explain next week.
The author is former director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies and was
special adviser to the former chancellor, Mr Norman Lamont.

FT  13 JUL 93 / Letter: Break with model habit will improve forecasting
results
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Prof PAUL ORMEROD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The interchange between Professors David Currie and Tim Congdon in your
letters columns (July 8 and 2 respectively) about forecasting records points
to an important conclusion.
There are many nuances within the body of orthodox macroeconomics which are
the subject of legitimate disagreement. Both the particular discussion
between David Currie and Tim Congdon and the more general flurries of
argument between the Seven Wise Men who advise the Treasury illustrate this
point.
But whatever approach is used, whatever the particular emphasis given to
this or that point of theory, the forecasting record of the models is poor.
David Currie makes the point very clearly when he writes: 'Differences
between individual predictions are typically small compared with forecasting
mistakes.'
The poor short-term forecasting record of these models has persisted since
their inception in the UK some two decades ago. Similar problems exist with
similar models in other countries.
On any normal scientific criterion, the conclusion would be drawn that
conventional macro-economics, whether Keynesian or monetarist, does not
offer an adequate description of the behaviour of developed economies.
It is difficult, both psychologically and intellectually, to set aside a
conventional paradigm. But as a former macro-modeller myself, I have come to
the view that it is possible. And it is also necessary, for until economists
are prepared to do this and to investigate alternative methodologies, their
ability to understand the world will not improve.

FT  13 JUL 93 / Letter: Changes that threaten employment prospects of
disabled
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr STEPHEN DUCKWORTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, David Hunt, secretary for employment, has announced proposed changes to
special schemes for disabled people in employment ('Grants to employers on
disabled to be halved', June 26). This signalled an end to the Disabled
Person's (1944) Employment Act. The fact that people qualifying for special
schemes will not under the proposals need to be registered - which they
currently are under the act - implies the 'quota' requiring 3 per cent of a
workforce to be registered disabled people is dead. Does this indicate the
government's intention to introduce new laws to protect the rights of
disabled people?
Other proposed changes have not been thought through. Currently, disabled
people who need extra equipment or services to work receive them with no
additional cost to the employer. After April 1994, employers will be
required to pay 50 per cent. This may be acceptable to large companies but
what about self-employed people and small companies which have just survived
the recession?
My company employs five people and has eight associates; all but one are
highly qualified, skilful disabled people. The other is severely
able-bodied. What will I tell them if these proposals put me out of
business?

FT  13 JUL 93 / Letter: Relatively imprecise about kin
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr HELMUT KULITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I've read with satisfaction and joy that Donald Duck and his kin - plus
a certain mouse called Mickey - have returned to Chinese news stands. That's
good news. However, I'd like to call your attention to a number of
imprecisions ('Mickey Mouse squeaks back into Beijing on best behaviour',
international and early UK editions):
1. Donald Duck does not have 'exuberant offspring' because, of course,
Hughie, Dewey and Louie are his nephews, not his sons. They were sent to Mr
Duck by a certain cousin Della in 1937.
2. You call Mr McDuck, the money-worshipping arch-capitalist, 'Dagobert' by
first name. In fact, his name is Scrooge McDuck, while 'Dagobert' is the
Christian name chosen for the German edition. I don't think that you, even
as a leading paper in economic and financial affairs, will get invited to Mr
McDuck's billionaires' parties if you continue to use his name wrongly.
3. You mention Mr McDuck's 'habit of bathing in piles of dollar bills'. This
is not entirely correct. Mr McDuck does in fact swim in heaps of money
(three cubic hectares, to be precise). However, he relishes coins as much as
or more than bills. Allow me to draw your attention to 'Only a poor old man'
(1952): 'And I like to dive around in my money like a porpoise] And burrow
through it like a gopher] And toss it up and let it hit me on the head]' All
this would be very difficult if he had nothing but dollar bills.

<TEXT>
Sir, I represent the electoral division of Kent County Council in which the
Police Authority HQ is located. Immediately adjacent to it are two large
estates, both of which suffer from serious deprivation and, not unconnected,
petty crime.
While home secretary Michael Howard was no doubt right when he told the
Association of Chief Police Officers that farmers, head teachers and
shopkeepers all knew something about crime ('Howard rejects criticism of
police authority reform', July 9), I am certain crime and fear of crime are
more likely to be part of the everyday experience of my constituents than of
the groups he names.
However, I doubt that his proposed reforms will lead to any of my
constituents being asked to make the short walk up the road to join the Kent
Police Authority to share their experiences with Mr Howard's political
appointee friends.

FT  13 JUL 93 / Letter: Flaws in argument on wage checks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr IVAN K COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Peter Ingram (Personal View: 'Give shareholders more power over pay',
July 8) suggests that one way of providing a greater check on wage inflation
is through greater control being exerted by shareholders, particularly the
large institutional shareholders. While greater shareholder activism is to
be encouraged in general, Mr Ingram's argument is flawed by failing to
recognise the full chain of responsibility. Institutional shareholders,
especially the pension funds, are responsible in turn to those on whose
behalf they manage these large asset holdings. In most cases, these are the
very people Mr Ingram suggests should have their wage increases checked by
institutional shareholders. While it is true that fund managers are not as
accountable as might be optimal, any wage increases that do occur will
usually result in a greater inflow of contributions to the institutional
shareholders. Mr Ingram must be a microeconomist, as his arguments fail to
acknowledge the whole panorama.
Besides, if we need to address the 'problem of wage growth outstripping
productivity' we would be better served by concentrating on the productivity
side of the issue.

FT  13 JUL 93 / Unusual show of strength: Japan's election poses questions
about the bureaucracy's role
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, Japan's prime minister, apparently mortally wounded by a
no-confidence vote against him two weeks ago, turned the conventional wisdom
of Japanese politics on its head last week: he took a decision.
Not only was the decision significant - to make concessions to secure a
framework for trade talks - but Mr Miyazawa did so despite opposition from
one of the most powerful arms of Japan's bureaucracy, the Ministry for
International Trade and Industry.
Mr Miyazawa bypassed Miti with a personal letter to President Bill Clinton
to reopen talks with the US, stalled in Tokyo 10 days ago. Miti was furious,
but worse was to come.
Mr Miyazawa repeatedly intervened last week to keep negotiations going. His
boldness sent a shudder through the ordered world of Kasumigaseki, the Tokyo
district between the Imperial Palace and parliament, which is home to
Tokyo's shabby ministries.
The life of the elite bureaucrats of Kasumigaseki rests upon a clear
division of labour: they decide the policies, the politicians present them;
the bureaucrats worry about Japan's long-term interests, the politicians
worry about getting re-elected; the bureaucracy prides itself on probity,
the political system is lubricated by corruption.
It was widely assumed that this division of labour would be reinforced by
the political turmoil in the run-up to next weekend's general election,
which was triggered by the no-confidence vote.
The prime minister was supposed to be a lame duck. The splits in the Liberal
Democratic party ranks mean the next government is almost certain to be a
coalition, preoccupied with political reform. So, many assumed, the
bureaucrats would fill the vacuum by increasing their already prodigious
power.
Mr Miyazawa's sudden transformation into a man of action has sent the
bureaucracy a warning. The political upheaval is not simply a challenge to
the LDP's political dominance, it is threatening to rewrite the rules by
which Japan has been governed since 1945. Under those rules, the LDP, in
power for 38 years, has provided a political umbrella under which the
bureaucracy can work untroubled by political interference. The LDP has
benefited from its privileged access to ministries, and can press for
concessions on behalf of constituents who may want building regulations
relaxed or a bridge built, for instance.
So the bureaucracy shares with the LDP a vested interest in maintaining the
post-war framework which has given it such influence.
Japan's top civil servants have been bred to rule. They are as powerful as
their counterparts in France, while being more pragmatic. They are more
practical than the British and less politicised than the Americans.
The bureaucrats are also a closed society - the top echelons of the finance
ministry, the pinnacle of the bureaucracy, are drawn almost exclusively from
one department of Tokyo University, the law faculty. The graduates of the
handful of universities - Tokyo, Waseda, Keio - which staff the upper posts
of the civil service will move through their careers together at the same
orderly pace, frequently crossing paths.
Yet in spite of this incestuousness, ministries compete fiercely to guard
their turf. The finance ministry, Miti and the foreign ministry run
parallel, but sometimes conflicting, foreign policies which cover trade,
finance and diplomacy.
Each ministry has a mission. At the finance ministry it is to keep the
public finances out of the clutches of spendthrift politicians. At Miti it
is to promote the interests of Japanese industry. At the foreign ministry it
is to shepherd Japan into a wider world role to match its economic
dominance.
Mr Noboru Hatakeyama, until recently the top official at Miti, believes the
bureaucrats will steer Japan through the political turmoil ahead. He
explained: 'This may be a fundamental change in the political structure but
not in the bureaucratic system, which is very stable, with capable people
who will serve their country even if there is are big changes in politics.'
In the short term, bureaucrats may gain more power. A senior finance
ministry official said: 'The bureaucracy is powerful when the politicians
are divided. When they cannot agree they turn to us for policies. If Japan
is now going to have rather unstable coalition government, with divisions
between partners on policies, then the bureaucracy may have to do more by
way of making policy.'
Yet the idea that the civil service will emerge after the election as the
main winner is probably mistaken, for two reasons.
First, top officials admit big decisions can only be taken by democratically
accountable politicians rather than unelected bureaucrats. As a rising stars
at the finance ministry admitted: 'The bureaucracy will keep the wheels of
government moving on small, routine decisions. But big issues, like tax
reform or whether another pump-priming package is needed to boost the
economy, require political leadership. The bureaucracy is too cautious to
take such decisions on its own.'
Mr Shinichi Kitaoka, professor of politics at Rikkyo University, put it this
way: 'Japanese bureaucrats are generally a talented lot but the bureaucracy
operates effectively only when it has good precedents. The end of the cold
war and the turmoil in Japan is taking us into a world without precedents.
Politicians must lead the way where no precedent exists, especially when
decisions such as on trade have global repercussions.'
Second, Japan's young reformers want to reorganise the relationship between
politics and the bureaucracy, to put politicians firmly in the driving seat.
Mr Ichiro Ozawa, one of the leaders of the Japan Renewal party, formed after
splitting from the LDP, argues Japan needs two parties capable of governing
to reinvigorate political debate. Mr Ozawa also believes Japan needs more
decisive leadership.
Mr Kazuo Aichi, another Japan Renewal member, said: 'Policies should be
decided openly by political debate, not in ministries. Politicians should
make decisions, set priorities and then the bureaucrats should carry them
out.'
There are few finer symbols of the system the reformers say they want to
overhaul than Mr Miyazawa, a cautious former civil servant turned
politician. They have poured scorn on his record and ridiculed his failure
to introduce reforms.
Yet as a lame duck, at the end of his career, he was suddenly freed last
week from the inhibiting customs and practices with which he has lived. As a
result he was able to take a decisive political initiative which would have
been unthinkable a month ago when he was nominally the most powerful man in
the country. In perhaps his final act as prime minister, Mr Miyazawa may
have set an example of decisiveness which the reformers will struggle to
match.

FT  13 JUL 93 / Arts: Lessons from the low life - Mary Rose Beaumont reviews
Peter Howson in Glasgow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARY ROSE BEAUMONT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It may sound somewhat premature for an artist to have a major retrospective
at the age of 35, but Peter Howson has no difficulty whatever in filling the
vast halls of Glasgow's McLellan Galleries with astonishing conviction. The
earliest work in the exhibition is a small but vivid crucifixion; painted at
the precocious age of six, it is prophetic of the subject of many of his
mature paintings, in which a single figure is tied to a post, a humiliation
actually undergone by a schoolfriend of the young Howson. This unpleasant
event left an indelible memory of human cruelty which has never been
exorcised and is indeed one of the constant motifs in his work.
Howson attended the Glasgow School of Art from 1975-77. He did not flourish
and left, ironically, to join the Scottish Infantry, which confirmed his
early experience of male brutality, later recorded in several shocking
pictures. Before returning to the School of Art, he did various menial jobs
which gave him a unique insight into the low life of Glasgow, a fruitful
source of inspiration ever since. His repertoire of characters, observed
during those years, include boxers, dossers, derelicts and drinkers, all
failures and rejects of our society.
Scottish Expressionism came to the fore during the 1980s, and Howson, along
with other graduates of the Glasgow School of Art, sprang to prominence in
an exhibition called New Image Glasgow which alerted the world to a new,
feisty, urban-based art, inspired to an extent by German Expressionism, but
with a compassion for the underdog which was peculiar to Scotland.
Baudelaire would have been delighted with this late 20th century celebration
of 'the heroism of modern life'.
Howson has been accused of excessive caricature. I think exaggeration is a
better word, exaggeration of features and gestures to make his point: the
bully boys look more bestial, the depraved look more delinquent, and the
depressed look suicidal. Mob hysteria, such as at a football match, and Nazi
salutes given by those taunting a trussed and helpless victim, are warnings
against the kind of mindless violence with which we are becoming
increasingly familiar. So-called 'Patriots', as we know, are easily
transformed into right wing extremists.
Howson's most impressive achievements are his triptychs, which have rightly
been called apocalyptic. The world is his stage and human conflicts and
desires his subjects. Violence on a global scale is endemic in these works,
yet he can present sympathetically the predicament of a single individual:
in 'The Three Faces of Eve', 1990, the three panels trace the downfall of a
young woman from innocent childhood through the stew of a grotesquely
decadent nightclub to her degradation and probable death in a graveyard. One
is swept along by the narrative, marvelling at the technical skill with
which the artist has deployed the complex compositions.
Portraits are important to Howson. He has portrayed himself in many moods
and aspects, but perhaps his most sustained achievement is the set of 25
etchings entitled 'Saracen Heads', 1988, a gallery of exquisitely drawn
heads of types encountered in the Saracen pub close to his studio in
Glasgow's East End. A series of 'Gallowgate Guests', 1991, in mixed media on
paper, investigates another terrifying array of mostly evil-looking people,
many of whom, like the pig-faced patriot have appeared in the paintings (to
September 5).
At the Glasgow Print Studio Adrian Wiszniewski is showing a new suite of ten
prints in a variety of techniques entitled 'Sex and Matisse'. The prints
play on a variety of themes by or of Matisse - a bather, an odalisque, a
musical instrument in an interior and a photograph of the wheelchair-bound
old man directing an assistant (an odalisque up a ladder) on the placing of
his paper cut-outs. Wiszniewski also had in mind Madonna's book Sex, the
titles of his prints wittily playing on the crossover between artist and
artiste, between camp and vamp.
Wiszniewski has abandoned his erstwhile dreaming youths for wall paintings
covered with huge abstract marks made with a house painter's brush.
Cursively written neon signs give full rein to his visual jokes and puns,
such as 'If In Doubt, Use Black', a hoary art school cliche, or 'This Happy
Void', a phrase with which the artist aims to counteract the prevailing fin
de siecle gloom with bouncing optimism.
The most recent work is in cut and painted perspex. Here too, the titles are
important: 'Coffee and Cream' is a small white square set over a larger one
in 'Cafe au lait'. A set of glorious carmine rectangles arranged according
to the Fibonacci system is entitled 'Rosebud', a not so oblique reference to
Citizen Kane. These seem to me to be key works, perhaps a turning point in
Wiszniewski's career (to July 24).
The William Hardie Gallery is showing Some Very New Paintings by David
Hockney. The paintings are designated simply as 'The First (or Twenty First)
VN Painting', and what is VN about them is that they are brilliantly
coloured, almost entirely abstract paintings in the same mode as those
currently on show in the Royal Academy Summer Exhibition. The works stem
from Hockney's designs for Richard Strauss's Die Frau Ohne Schatten,
performed at Covent Garden last autumn. As the hero of the opera is Barak
the Dyer, Hockney conceived the settings in terms of colour, light and
texture, which has translated very effectively into easel paintings. Those
who think of Hockney as a consummate draughtsman and figurative painter will
hate these VN paintings, but those who are prepared to follow him onto the
stage will enjoy them for their lush ebullience (to August 27).

FT  13 JUL 93 / Arts: Sunset Boulevard - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Given the imminent closure of City of Angels, which I described as the
wittiest musical I have seen, I shall try to be exceptionally careful about
any adjectives applied to Sunset Boulevard, the new show by Sir Andrew Lloyd
Webber.
Certainly 'witty' is not a word that comes to mind. The nearest it comes to
a mordant joke is 'It's fun to see how bad bad writing can be.' There's also
a rather good line about it taking tiles to tango. But perhaps the absence
of wise-cracking, double meanings and sly asides is part of its charm.
Possibly City of Angels failed to be appreciated in London because it seemed
too clever by half, trying to combine a script with a musical.
There is no such distraction in Sunset Boulevard, which is odd in a way
because it comes from a similar Los Angeles set-up. The piece is based on
Billy Wilder's 1950 movie and there is plenty of pain in the background.
Firmly in the foreground, however, is a sentimental show with some of the
stunning Lloyd Webber staging to which we have become accustomed over the
years.
In Patti LuPone, there is also a star. Ms LuPone played Evita on Broadway in
what has always seemed to me Lloyd Webber's best work. As the faded movie
idol, she is no less glittering now. It must be deliberate: the show does
not effectively get under way until she appears, which is 20 minutes into
the first act. Then Sunset Boulevard takes off.
There is something else about Ms LuPone's first entry. She starts to sing
almost without having bothered to talk: not just one song, but two. That is
when you think what a clever composer Lloyd Webber is: the master of the
slow build-up. The sound of a growingly confident orchestra fills the house
and you are persuaded that the piece can never look back.
The illusion lasts through the interval and into the start of the second
act. As the curtain goes up again, the writer Joe Gillis launches with great
panache into the song which has the same name as the show. It looks as if he
has come to terms with living off the riches of Ms LuPone's Norma Desmond
and is at home in her palatial house and (no doubt) palatial bed.
Yet illusion it is. There is another, younger, poorer girl who also writes
scripts. Joe falls for her and she for him. It is not the sentimentality
that one objects to. After all, why not? It is the fact that Sunset
Boulevard then begins to lose its power. All the momentum that has been
built up starts to ebb away. The plot, never the strongest point, becomes
ridiculous. It is a curious dramatic failing that the girl, having been
invited to the great house, should depart with a line as banal as 'I can't
look at you any more, Joe.' She leaves an extraordinary sense of
anti-climax.
Again, there is the strange business of Ms LuPone's protective butler. Quite
late on he claims that he was her first husband and first director. Is it
true? Does Norma Desmond remember or has she simply forgotten as she dreams
of returning to stardom? Nothing of this is explained; nothing is developed.
True, there are great set-pieces still to come, not least the finale, though
even that is prefaced by the rather feeble shooting of Joe by Ms LuPone as
he walks down her stairs. Still, she gets her last great moment. When the
media arrive to cover the killing, the butler tells her that the cameramen
have come to film her for a new movie. And, of course, she believes it:
'This is my life. Just a camera and all you wonderful people out there in
the dark.'
The sets, designed by John Napier, are as ambitious as you would expect in a
Lloyd Webber spectacular, so much so that the production was postponed for
two weeks because the machinery failed to work. Ms LuPone wears some
wonderful costumes, the work of Anthony Powell, though the variety of gear
worn by the extras does not make for great visual harmony in the chorus
scenes. This can be distracting from the music.
One song, in particular, stands out and passes the hummable test. 'The
Perfect Year' is composed to go along side 'Auld Lang Syne' on New Year's
Eve, and at one stage cleverly it does. What I admire about it is that it
looks forward not back, even when the grounds for hope are slim. The words
are simple, but touching.
I also admired Kevin Anderson's performance as Joe, very casual at first,
very straight and therefore a hard part to play. Yet the trouble with a role
like this is that it doesn't lead anywhere. He's just a decent guy who isn't
even allowed a dying word. It's a great pity that Noel Coward wrote the song
'Mad About the Boy' some years ago. Sunset Boulevard quotes it several
times, and it would have fitted very well, for that largely is what the
piece is about.
Daniel Benzali sings very well as the butler, and he, too, has played in
Lloyd Webber before. But it is too strange, phantomish a part to be
convincing. Trevor Nunn directs.

At the Barbican on Sunday, Radu Lupu gave an immaculate account of
Beethoven's C minor piano concerto, the Third. The light gravity which is
Lupu's special grace - everything judiciously weighted, nothing portentous -
was ideal for the work. Though his platform demeanour was dour as ever, he
lit up every movement, from his beautifully poised entry in the first
movement to the playfully pointed Rondo. The Largo was a singing idyll.
The London Symphony was conducted by Mstislav Rostropovich, who is regularly
at his best when accompanying an artist he admires. Throughout, he was as
attentive and sympathetic as could be. So he was, evidently, in the Fourth
Symphony - 'The Morning Star Arises' - of Vyacheslav Artyomov, which was
receiving its world premiere here through his good offices; that, however,
was surely misplaced loyalty. Artyomov is yet another Russian composer of
whom the West has scarcely heard, but he sounds most unlikely to acquire the
almost-overnight fame of Gubaidulina or even Gorecki.
His Fourth completes a tetralogy, after 'The Way to Olympus', 'On the
Threshold' and 'Gentle Emanation'. The project has a Skryabinesque ring,
confirmed by Artyomov's declaration that his music 'is an expression of my
inner soul as a composer, and that is how it reflects the soul of the
world'. Without wishing to contradict him (for what he writes is doubtless
passionately felt), one may add that it also reflects the most ear-catching
devices of recently fashionable Western composers. It is a 'symphony' of
familiar effects, notable only for squeezing so many of them into one work.
It took nearly three-quarters of an hour, of which a record number of
minutes outstayed their welcome. It began with stormy churnings, like the
more hectic passages in a Skryabin symphony, though there was a sudden echo
of Holst's 'Uranus'. (At the close, 'Neptune' would come irresistibly to
mind as well, and some Britten and Messiaen surfaced too.) There was an
interlude of slow, ticking harps over menacing rumbles, with florid
outbursts for unison strings; the climax lay agonisingly high for the
violins. A skirling oriental march came and went like an irrelevant memory
of Borodin.
Eventually the music settled into middle-period Berio mode, almost immobile:
long, sustained chords shifting only by a note or two at a time. A
groundswell of 'celestial' binging and bonging which had threatened earlier
 -Artyomov's percussion is recklessly, self-defeatingly overdone - became a
flood, and children's voices sang something uplifting (not identified in the
programme). With only a construction of the loosest kind to shore them up,
none of these effects seemed more than wilful hectoring. Not much fun.

At 8.30 BBC2 and ITV each launch a new run of a well established factual
series. In Far Flung Floyd (BBC2) the most entertaining of today's
television cooks, Keith Floyd, presents the first of seven programmes
reporting on the food of the Far East. He begins in Vietnam, cooking a stew
for an army volley ball team. In another series of The Cook Report (ITV) the
increasingly large Roger Cook sets out again to stick his foot -
figuratively and, when necessary, literally - in the doors of the world's
villains.
Switched At Birth is one of those productions for which the ITV chiefs would
like to move 'News At 10'. An American mini series, it tells of the parents
of a baby girl who discover that they cannot be her biological parents. It
begins at 9.00, continues at 10.40 and ends tomorrow.
In Scarfe On Class the cartoonist makes one of his periodic forays into Big
Subjects: his previous programmes on art, sex and the afterlife will be
repeated on forthcoming Tuesdays. In today's new programme he learns how to
acquire the right accent, and even a lordship (9.50 BBC2).

FT  13 JUL 93 / Arts: Neil Young - Pop
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Gods seem to favour ageing hippies. Amazement that they have survived,
touched with awe at the amount of death defying drugs they have absorbed,
gives them an almost priestly authority. They also seem to have control over
the elements. As Neil Young stepped on stage at Finsbury Park on Sunday
night the rain stopped. It stayed cold, dank and dismal, but marginally the
spirits perked up.
They stayed perked for the next two hours as Young went through his
considerable bag of tricks. He has over 20 years of recorded products to
choose from, covering every highway and byway of pop, from Woodstock
dottiness to poke-in -the-eye grunge. You somehow forget that he was
responsible for such classics as 'Heart of Gold', 'Only Love Can Break Your
Heart' and 'Alabama', and on and on. He could fill a week's play list on
Classic Gold, yet he still retains a musical integrity and the respect of
the myth makers .
It was all on offer in the park. For a man who set up the original super
group with Crosby, Stills, and Nash it is natural that he should now call on
the revered Memphis blues band, Booker T and the MGs to back him. Not that
he needs them. Young is a big musician, tall and sturdy, the mop of hair
surprisingly dark, the bald spot well disguised, the presence commanding. He
is also big in sound, contrasting his wailing, jagged, feed-back driven
guitar with some plaintive harp blowing. If this is returning to the past it
is exhilarating enough to make conservatives of us all.
The band was very much a supporting group, despite the lustre of legendary
guitarist Steve Cropper and Booker himself towering over the keyboards. This
was Young's party. It began slowly, inhibited perhaps by the cold, and the
rather forlorn-feeling crowd. The opening songs were equally melancholic,
with Young, digging deep into his roots for 'Southern Man' and the stricken
'Helpless'. Gradually the atmosphere warmed up with 'Motorcycle Man', which
brought in backing vocals, and a buzz in the audience.
From being a static voice in a gathering gloom - and Young's voice has
deepened for the better over the decades - Young started to stomp the stage,
and the whole performance picked up steam. It is useless to pretend that a
sombre evening in a scrappy London park is an ideal setting for such a manic
performer. He flowers best in the claustrophobia of a small club, where he
can pepper his wit and cynicism over his music. But as he concentrated on
the classics, and brought in the band from the shadows for party pieces, you
at least knew you were experiencing one of the true giants of pop, a man for
all seasons. You can hardly grudge him his late flowering as a big venue
money grabber.

FT  13 JUL 93 / Arts: Rain stops play in Avignon - Anthony Curtis finds
Moliere's Don Juan gets more than he bargained for
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY CURTIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Don Juan of Moliere has a career that is identical with that of Mozart's
Don Giovanni, not surprisingly since they both stem from the same original
written by a Spanish monk. In both play and opera the Don has a faithful
servitor who accompanies him on his travels, takes much of the rap for his
misdeeds, and at one point swaps identities with him. But, as emerges from
the new production of Moliere's comedy at Avignon that opened this year's
Festival, there is a world of difference between the mood of the two works.
Through the interrogation of his master, amusingly combined with deference
and flattery, Moliere's Sganarelle forces him to define and redefine his
position in relation to the traditional Christian tenets he has repudiated.
The result is a mixture of black comedy and socratic dialogue that rips
apart the basic assumptions of family life. No wonder the Church saw that
the play should remain unstaged for many years and then allowed it to reach
the stage only in a sanitised version by Thomas Corneille. This was in spite
of the climax, as in Mozart, when the statue of the Commander whom Don Juan
has killed in a duel, comes to dinner - the subtitle is Le Festin de Pierre
(The Stone Feast) - and consigns him to hell.
At the first night in Avignon when the stone Commander nodded his head in
acceptance from his plinth there were magnificent claps of thunder and
flashes of lightning. Full marks, we thought, to Jacques Lassale, the
administrator of the Comedie Francaise who has directed this production. But
no, the storm was for real. Then the unthinkable happened, the heavens
opened and the rain poured down. There is no shelter either for actors or
audience in the Courtyard of the Papal Palace and so at around midnight the
play was abandoned with two acts still to go. I cannot remember rain
stopping play here ever before and I have been covering this Festival for at
least 10 years.
Even so three acts out of five were enough to take the measure of Lassale's
production. The setting could not be more simple or more effective. A
cluster of conifers to the left of the stage and a small stream in front
serve as the decor. Towering above them is the great medieval facade of the
palace alternatively shrouded in darkness or bathed in soft yellow light. It
is a formidable arena for a conflict between good and evil, expressed
through the discrepancy between appearance and reality, underlined by
Lassale in a series of costume changes. The Don enters in the traditional
black doublet and hose of a Spanish nobleman and we observe him being
stripped of this habit by the tubby cynical Sganarelle of Roland Bertin, an
experienced actor who has played many roles here in previous festivals. The
hero is then shaved and re-attired on stage in a colourful costume suitable
for a masquerade. This Don Juan has to contend not only with the ghost of
the Commander but with several historical ones, the ghosts of those great
actors who have played the role in living memory - Jouvet, Vilar, Strehler
among them.
Avignon's new Don Juan, the Polish actor Andrzej Seweryn has been working in
France since 1980. He joined the Comedie Francaise this year and he gives an
exciting interpretation of the exacting role. He has grace, agility,
gentleness; his striking lantern-jawed face provides a fine impassive mask
to match the enormity of his utterances and behaviour. He treats the tirades
as if they were nocturnes by Chopin, delivering them with delicate, subtle
articulation. The same lightness of touch is evident in his bodily contact
with the other characters, notably when he encounters his discarded wife
Elvira. This role of the one-time nun is played by Jeanne Balibar, a young
actress still a pupil of the Conservatoire: a great opportunity which she
seized passionately. Clearly we are going to hear a lot more of her in the
future.
The later scene with the two peasant girls (Catherine Sauval and Cecile
Brune) to both of whom Don Juan has promised marriage was played with a
similar balletic mobility. As Don Juan removed their bonnets and let down
their hair, it seemed only right and proper that they should have rejected
their longstanding rustic boyfriends in order to marry him. Seweryn
elegantly deflects their questions, refusing to commit himself to either by
name. In the end the two women are left embracing each other, the Don having
once more escaped.
Lassale is on record as saying that he views the comedy as 'a kind of road
movie.' Don Juan uncovers new aspects of himself with each encounter. They
are marked by the director's skilful use of the elements - water into which
one of his assailants is thrown, earth on which he sits, fire by the light
of which he unfolds his pragmatic morality to his servant. It will be
interesting to see how Lassale copes with these effects when this
essentially open-air production transfers to the Salle Richelieu in Paris
later this year. At least it will not be rained off there.

FT  13 JUL 93 / Business and the Law: Belgian pension rules discriminate -
European Court
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A Belgian law which laid down different methods for calculating pension
payments depending on the sex of the recipient was declared to be
discriminatory and contrary to European Community law despite the fact that
the retirement age of 60 was the same for men and women.
The case arose in the context of a preliminary reference from the Antwerp
employment tribunal. Under Belgian law, pension rights were calculated on
the basis of the number of years worked; this could not be higher than 45
for a man and 40 for a woman. The amount of the pension was fixed on the
basis of a percentage of the individual's earnings.
However, for the years worked before 1955, the amount fixed was a standard
sum. The male applicant was given his pension on the basis of 45 years'
work, nine of which were pre-1955. Had the applicant been female only four
of the 'standard' years would have been taken into account and the recipient
would have received a higher pension.
The court held that EC social security provisions prohibited discrimination
based on the sex of the individual when calculating benefits. The system
under Belgian law was discriminatory on this basis. The court also held that
the Belgian system did not fall within the exceptions laid down in the
relevant EC provisions.
The Court reiterated that the article in the EC directive laying down the
principle of non-discrimination was of direct effect; and it had been so
from the date set down for its implementation into national law. People
discriminated against, it said, had the right to be treated the same as
those who were at present favoured by national legislation.
C-154/92: Remi van Cant v Rijksdienst voor pensloenen, ECJ, July 1 1993
Parallel imports and the EC- Austria Free Trade Agreement
In a recent case, the Court was requested by a national court in Germany to
give a preliminary ruling on the issue of parallel imports from Austria to
Germany. This required the interpretation of certain provisions in the
EC-Austria Free Trade Agreement.
The case concerned parallel imports of a medicine from Austria to Germany.
The medicine had been made and sold in Germany. It was also exported by the
manufacturer to Austria, where it was sold by the manufacturer's Austrian
company.
A German parallel importer wanted to sell the same product in Germany by
importing it from Austria. The only difference between the imported product
and the domestic one was that the former would display a label with the
importer's name and address.
The importer sought permission for sale in Germany from the domestic
authorities. Documents showing that the product was identical to the
domestic product were lodged in support of the application. Under German
law, it was also necessary to produce evidence on the manufacture of the
product and quality control methods. The importer referred to the
manufacturer's evidence on these points, which had been lodged with the
national authorities.
Authorisation was refused on the grounds that insufficient evidence had been
produced. The matter was brought before a Berlin court, from where a
reference was sent to the ECJ.
The ECJ held that the provisions relating to the free movement of goods in
the EC-Austria Free Trade Agreement, which are identical to the
corresponding provisions in the EC treaty, should be construed as
prohibiting such action by the national authorities.
The British and Italian governments argued that, although the refusal to
grant the relevant authorisation was contrary to the provisions in the EC
treaty, the same could not be said when interpreting the provisions in the
free trade agreement. This was because the free trade agreement did not
envisage legislative harmonisation measures in the pharmaceutical sector.
This argument was rejected by the ECJ.

Quaker Oats Co has been ordered to pay Dollars 26.5m in damages to Sands,

Quaker was originally ordered to pay Dollars 42.6m to Sands for infringing

Quaker's best selling soft drink, Gatorade. The award was reduced after a
federal appeals court ruled that the original award was too high.

FT  13 JUL 93 / Business and the Law: Regional firms compete with City of
London - Legal Briefs
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Large regional firms are competing increasingly for work that has
traditionally been done by City of London law firms, according to the 1993
edition of The Legal 500*, the latest edition of the clients' guide to the
UK's top 500 law firms, which has just been published.
Regional firms have improved in quality terms, it says, and have proved very
competitive on cost. During the recession this has proved attractive to
commercial clients.
Otherwise, this sixth edition of the guide contains few surprises. The list
of the top 10 company and commercial law firms in London, for example, is
the same as in 1992, except that Allen &amp; Overy and Lovell White Durrant have
moved up a couple of places at the expense of Norton Rose and Herbert Smith.
One feature absent from the 1993 guide that will be sorely missed is its
recommendation of 'firms going from strength to strength'. Perhaps this is
an indication of the impact of the recession on the legal profession.

FT  13 JUL 93 / People: Emmott shops down south at Sainsbury
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The mystery over the destination of Bob Emmott, who resigned last week as
joint deputy managing director of Wm Morrison, the Bradford-based superstore
chain, was solved yesterday when J Sainsbury announced his appointment as
managing director, specialist businesses.
Sainsbury admits the appointment of an outsider to such a position is
unusual, but observes that Morrisons is a 'highly-respected' regional
superstore operator and Emmott has broad experience.
Emmott, 49, will have full profit responsibility for Sainsbury's petrol
stations, in-store bakeries and restaurants. It is the first time these
businesses, currently the responsibility of different directors, have been
brought together under one manager. Emmott also gets a seat on the board at
Savacentre, Sainsbury's hypermarket chain. He will report to David Clapham,
a member of Sainsbury's main board.
Moving to Sainsbury may be something of a culture shock, but Emmott's 23
years with Morrisons - during which time he has had responsibility for
trading, marketing, store operations, planning and formats, and distribution
and factories - should equip him well.

Andersen
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Jim Wadia is to become managing partner of Arthur Andersen, the UK's fourth
largest accountancy firm, in succession to Roy Chapman.
Chapman, 56, is retiring following completion of his four-year term as
managing partner for the UK. He will leave at the end of the year after a
four-month transition period.
Wadia, 45, whose appointment was ratified by a vote of the UK partners after
internal consultation, has spent his career working on tax matters.
Currently deputy managing partner, he takes on the new role on September 1
at the start of Andersen's fiscal year.
Chapman became managing partner of the London office in 1984, and has been
managing partner of the UK firm since 1989. He has served on the worldwide
board of partners since 1988 and is chairman of its remuneration committee.
He says he had long planned to retire in his mid-50s, and that it is
standard practice to step down from major responsibilities at this age. He
stresses that he is retiring, and intends to travel and pursue leisure
interests for the first few months. After that, he says he may consider
becoming a non-executive director.

FT  13 JUL 93 / People: Richard Farrant to head SFA
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Securities and Futures Authority, the self-regulatory organisation for
the professional securities business, is replacing John Young, who has moved
on to become chief executive of the Securities &amp; Investments Board, with
Bank of England veteran Richard Farrant.
Farrant, 49, who has been at the Bank since 1967, is currently one of the
four deputy heads of banking supervision, with specific responsibility for
supervisory policy. He has therefore had no recent line-management
responsibilities for the likes of BCCI, and is not named in the Bingham
report which criticised the Bank of England's supervisory role in the
collapse of the corrupt international bank.
Christopher Sharples, chairman of the SFA, points out that Farrant is 'very
knowledgeable' on the international aspects of the SFA's business. In
addition to his familiarity with Brussels and the formulation of EC
directives, he is one of the two UK members of the Basle Supervisors
Committee, and has chaired its off balance sheet group since 1991.
He has also had spells abroad, notably with the IMF in Washington and in
Hong Kong. Between 1984 and 1986, he served as adviser to the Hong Kong
Banking Commissioner, handling a succession of crises in local banks as well
as working on the revision of the centre's bank supervision law.
A keen cyclist, pedalling from Paddington to the Bank every morning, Farrant
is already familiar with the SFA's style having worked with its capital
committee. He claims to be impressed by the 'close practitioner involvement'
in the SFA's approach to regulation.
Young, a former deputy senior partner of Simon &amp; Coates before he moved to
the Stock Exchange, was there when TSA, the securities regulator which later
merged with the futures regulatory body, was set up, and is credited with
helping to set the tone for an informal and practical approach to
regulation. 'The SFA has been good and diligent, and possibly lucky, in not
having an accident on its doorstep,' comments one well-placed source.
While there are few Bank of England alumni in senior positions at the SROs,
the SFA's head of enforcement, Andrew Jennings, spent ten years at the Old
Lady.

FT  13 JUL 93 / Business and the Law: Solutions to Chinese puzzle - The
challenges posed by listing mainland companies on Hong Kong's stock exchange
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN experiment in marrying China's socialist civil law system to Hong Kong's
version of UK common law is nearing completion, with the listing this month
of the first mainland Chinese state-controlled company on the Hong Kong
Stock Exchange.
Tsingtao Brewery, shares in which will be traded from this Thursday, is the
first of nine companies being brought to market.
Incorporated in Tsingtao's articles of association is an attempt to codify
common law on matters such as the role and responsibilities of directors,
protection of minorities, and accounting standards.
Corporate law in China is still in its infancy. It was only in May last year
that the Chinese government published a set of regulations governing
companies, known as the Standard Opinion on Joint Stock Companies. The
Standard Opinion applies to mainland Chinese companies which have issued, or
plan to issue, shares to employees, the public or both. It is an interim set
of regulations that has the force of law, and will stand until officials
have drafted a comprehensive companies law - currently undergoing its fourth
revision.
A Hong Kong Stock Exchange team, led by Mr Anthony Neoh, QC, and
incorporating outside legal experts and representatives from the Securities
and Futures Commission, the colony's corporate watchdog, worked for nearly a
year with mainland Chinese counterparts on the terms under which the Hong
Kong exchange would accept a mainland company listing. The Hong Kong
exchange and the SFC were concerned to ensure that minority shareholders in
Chinese companies would have a level of investor protection comparable with
that of shareholders in companies registered in Hong Kong. Hong Kong
companies are subject to the colony's Companies Ordinance, stock exchange
listing rules and regulation by the SFC.
The most difficult issue they had to overcome was the difference between
Hong Kong and Chinese law. In China, law is found only in written codes.
Case law, where it exists, is used merely for reference. By contrast, Hong
Kong's law, as with other common law jurisdictions, is based on statute and
principles developed in the courts, and so is found only in case law.
'The whole law on the fiduciary responsibilities of directors or the rights
of different classes of shareholders has been built up by our courts since
the 1850s and 1860s,' says Mr Neoh. To ensure that mainland Chinese
directors and managers would be subject to the same legal constraints as
their counterparts in Hong Kong, 'we had to go back to the cases to extract
the principles', he adds.
The mainland companies are issuing class 'H' shares in Hong Kong. These
shares differ legally from class 'A' shares, which will be issued to
mainland shareholders, much in the same way as ordinary shares differ from
preference shares. The question of class rights - between holders of 'H' and
'A' shares - was solved by adopting Canada's codification of common law on
the subject, as enshrined in its Business Corporations Act.
Other factors, such as the duties and obligations of directors, were derived
from Hong Kong case law. China's Standard Opinion says the duty of directors
is to act 'honestly and sincerely'; it is silent on a director's
obligations. The articles of association of Tsingtao incorporate standard
'duties and obligations' familiar to any western director, such as: 'To
observe obliga-tions of a fiduciary not to place himself in a position where
his duty and his interest may conflict.'
Another potential difficulty was shareholders' right of redress in the
courts. This was solved by incorporating in the articles of association a
provision for disputes to be adjudicated - at the choice of the claimant -
in either the China International Economic and Trade Arbitration Commission
or the Hong Kong International Arbitration Centre. Judgments in either
tribunal are enforceable in either jurisdiction, because China and the UK
(and by extension Hong Kong) are party to the New York Convention for the
Recognition and Enforcement of Arbitral Awards.
The mainland companies have also accepted that their directors can be sued
personally. Under Hong Kong corporate law only the company can sue its
directors. If a shareholder can prove oppression by a controlling
shareholder, an individual can sue a director on behalf of other minority
shareholders in what is known as a 'derivative action'.
A derivative action, however, is an unknown legal concept in China. So,
through a series of interlocking contracts signed by the directors and the
company, shareholders in the nine state companies will be able to sue a
director personally.
Mr Neoh concedes that it is difficult to predict how this provision will
develop, but says: 'This provision will put pressure on non-defaulting
directors to act against the defaulting director to avoid their being
embroiled in a legal dispute.'
The talks between the mainland Chinese and Hong Kong officials were
facilitated by the fact that many of them had western legal training, says
Mr Neoh. He says, for example: 'I asked them what their conception of a
limited company was. One senior official said a limited company was one
where the company was liable only to the extent of its capital. Another,
giving the correct answer, said a limited company meant shareholders were
not liable for more than their initial subscription.' At that moment, says
Mr Neoh, one mainland official piped up: 'Salomon against Salomon' - a
reference to a US case from 1897 which established the limitations of
liability of shareholders to their subscription of capital.
The initial Chinese confusion stemmed from the definition of a company in
the Standard Opinion, says Mr Neoh. It says a shareholder 'must, within the
limits of his contribution, be responsible for the company's debts'.
In spite of recent developments, modern law in China - only 14 years in the
making - remains in a state of flux. It is a land where the rule of man has
always prevailed over the rule of law. From imperial times to the present,
the obiter dicta of the emperor or the Communist party chief has been
accorded the force of law. In 1988, Mr Peng Zhen, a senior Communist party
elder who, in UK legal terms, held the twin responsibilities of home
secretary and Lord Chancellor, was asked if the law was more important than
the Communist party. 'I'm not very sure about that,' Mr Peng said.
The codified common law written into the articles of association of the
Chinese companies being listed in Hong Kong does not recognise the Communist
party. Duties and obligations are framed solely in terms of a company's
relationship with its owners.
Mr Neoh is cautiously optimistic. 'We have spent a lot of time with these
companies - I have visited three of them myself - and they are very keen to
comply with our rules,' he says. 'There are two forces working in our
direction: management have a boss to report to; and there is market
discipline. Their share price will fall if they break the rules.'
But he concedes he cannot forecast how successful the changes will be. 'I
can't predict anything; I'm just hoping. We should know within the next six
months or so.'

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The business logic behind British Telecommunications' investment in MW
Marshall, one of the world's biggest foreign exchange brokers, may not be as
powerful as it was, but for Barry Cameron Smail, who negotiated the deal, it
has a happy ending.
Cameron Smail, a 38-year-old Scottish accountant, has been BT's
representative on the board of Marshalls Finance, MW Marshall's parent,
since the Pounds 175m management buy-out in February 1989. After four and a
half years working for Britain's biggest company he has decided to give up
his job as finance director of BT's personal communications division and
return to the financial services industry as an executive director of MW
Marshall.
His decision to return to full-time City life - he used to be treasurer of
Commercial Union - is not entirely unrelated to the shrinkage in the size of
BT. He was recruited to be BT's treasurer by Barry Romeril, the BT finance
director, who recently departed for Xerox. The BT workforce has shrunk from
240,000 to 170,000 in Cameron Smail's time and he says that he missed the
financial services industry.
Mike Knowles, Marshall's chairman, says that now that the company has paid
back much of its MBO debt it wants to start filling in some of the gaps in
its activities and Cameron Smail will be responsible for expanding the
capital markets side. 'We are very strong in cash markets but want to grow
in off-balance sheet areas,' says Knowles.
One of the reasons that BT took a 30 per cent stake in the MW Marshall
buy-out was so that it could learn more about what its customers in the
foreign exchange markets wanted. Although the market for sophisticated
foreign exchange dealing equipment has not proved as lucrative as once
thought, it is understood that in financial terms BT's investment in
Marshalls has turned out well.

FT  13 JUL 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Focus on bank charges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Does it make sense to shop around among banks for a good deal? A trial
carried out by Business Money, a new monthly newsletter,* reveals
significant differences between the charges quoted by a range of banks.
The 17 banks approached provided quotes ranging from Pounds 17 to Pounds
1,400 to manage an account for a year. Business Money asked the banks to
quote for a customer expecting to write more than Pounds 100,000 worth of
cheques a year, paying in 300 cheques and Pounds 2,000 in cash a month, and
maintaining an average credit balance of Pounds 3,000.
The newsletter is based in Street, Somerset and stipulated the account must
be maintained elsewhere, to prevent discrimination against banks without a
local branch. Many businesses prefer a local contact point but others with
accounts in credit often never visit their branch, says Robert Lefroy,
editor and a former banker with 28 years experience.
The Pounds 17 quote came from Allied Trust, a London-based bank with no
branch network; the Pounds 1,400 proposal from National Westminster.
Other low quotes came from the Coop Bank (Pounds 750, though this included
six months free banking) and Clydesdale Bank (Pounds 911). Offers from the
other main clearers were Pounds 1,161 from Lloyds and Pounds 1,258 from
Barclays while Midland refused to quote, citing, according to Lefroy, its
'aggressive new policy.'
Quotes of between Pounds 1,100 and Pounds 1,200 came from Allied Irish, Bank
of Scotland, Royal Bank of Scotland and Ulster Bank.
One lesson to emerge was it might make sense for companies to split their
banking, putting cash deposits through Girobank and other business through
low-cost operations, suggests Lefroy.

<TEXT>
In the US, failure is often regarded as a learning experience. In the UK
even success is no guarantee a businessman can raise finance.
In contrast with the US, British venture capitalists make very little use of
'second time entrepreneurs,' businessmen and women who have sold one
successful venture and want to move on to a second, according to a study* by
the Centre for Management Buy-Out Research.
Nearly three-quarters of venture capitalists polled said they would prefer
to finance an entrepreneur or a manager who had played a leading role in a
previous venture. But only 23 per cent had used a team leader from one of
their own investments again. And while 53 per cent used a team leader
previously backed by another venture firm these two figures overlapped and
total use, as a share of deals completed, was low.
The main reason given by venture capitalists was that they could not find
suitable candidates. The entrepreneur's experience might be in a different
sector or in a much smaller or larger company. Venture capitalists were
suspicious that someone who had made one fortune would be insufficiently
motivated to do it again.
It also emerged that venture capitalists did not actively pursue
entrepreneurs who had sold out. Only 17 per cent of venture firms polled
evaluated their successful entrepreneurs.
But the venture capitalists were not to blame alone. Many entrepreneurs were
reluctant to go a second round with the same venture capitalist who had
backed them the first time. Also, having made one fortune, the entrepreneur
might have less need of venture funds to get started a second time.

FT  13 JUL 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Understanding the issues
 -Charles Batchelor continues his series answering questions on the European
single market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Growing Business Page's Single Market Q&amp;A series is intended to allow
readers to raise issues prompted by the formal launch of the single European
market on January 1, 1993.
In theory the barriers have come down in Europe, but in practice doing
business across borders can be complex and time consuming.
Merits of a pan-European title
Q: In your last Single Market Q&amp;A you explained how EC legislation on the
compatibility of professional qualifications would allow a British chartered
engineer to register in Germany.
We are consulting civil and structural engineers and are currently
evaluating a number of projects in Germany. A few years ago all chartered
engineers were encouraged to register as European Engineers and were
rewarded with the qualification Eur. Ing. Does this qualification carry any
real weight? Is it sufficient to guarantee acceptance on the official list
of approved engineers at the regional chambers of architects
(Architektenkammer).
A: The Eur. Ing. title is a pan-European title for chartered engineers
operating in Europe, though it is not covered by EC legislation on the
freedom of establishment of professionals (89/48/EEC). It confers no extra
privileges but its value lies in the fact that it is a readily recognisable
professional qualification Europe-wide.
More than 15,000 professional engineers in Europe currently hold the title,
with some 300 applying every month.
Although the Eur. Ing. title may only be obtained by qualified chartered
engineers it is not sufficient to guarantee acceptance on the official list
of approved engineers at the regional chambers of architects.
VAT reporting requirements queried
Q: I have recently set up a business and will shortly start exporting to
other EC member states. What are the present VAT reporting requirements in
the UK?
A: UK VAT registered businesses are required to provide Customs and Excise
with EC Sales Lists (ESLs), on a quarterly basis, for all sales to other VAT
registered businesses in the Community. These lists itemise sales by values
and VAT registration numbers of buyers. They are required by Customs at the
end of each calender quarter - March, June, September and December.
However, small businesses with an annual turnover of less than Pounds 62,000
and sales not exceeding Pounds 11,500 in the EC may be exempted from
providing ESLs. This is discretionary and you should seek guidance from your
Customs office.
Businesses with exports exceeding Pounds 135,000 a year to the EC must also
provide Supplementary Sales Declarations (SSDs) on a calender month basis.
These reports must list a minimum of eight items of transaction data, for
example, delivery term and mode of transport, for each sale.
Importers who exceed the Pounds 135,000 threshold for EC purchases must also
provide SSDs, the information for which is used to compile European
Community trade statistics known as Intrastats.
A green approach to labelling
Q: I have heard there is a label which states that my products are
environmentally sound. How can I obtain such a label and what are the
objectives of the scheme?
A: The label to which you refer is the EC Ecolabel which demonstrates that
your product has the minimum adverse impact on the environment. To apply for
an Ecolabel contact one of the national organisations set up to administer
the scheme. In the UK it is: UK Ecolabelling Board, 7th Floor, Eastbury
House, 30-34 Albert Embankment, London SE1 7TL. Tel: 071 820 1199. Fax: 071
820 1104.
The purpose of the voluntary scheme is to promote the design, production,
marketing and use of products that have the least impact on the environment.
The Ecolabel also aims to encourage the production of more environmentally
benign products.
EC working groups have started to devise Ecolabelling criteria for a range
of products, including washing machines, based on their environmental
performance throughout their life cycle.
Once the Ecolabelling organisation has decided to award a label it notifies
the European Commission. The Commission then informs interest groups in
other member states. After 30 days the Ecolabelling body may award the
label, provided there are no objections from either the Commission or
another member state. If objections are not resolved within a further 15
days the proposed award will be submitted to the Commission's Regulatory
Committee for a decision. A contract is drawn up between the Ecolabelling
authority and the applicant.
Notice of the award is published in the Official Journal of the European
Communities.
The Ecolabelling authority in the UK charges an application fee of Pounds
500 including VAT. An annual license fee of 0.15 per cent plus VAT is also
payable. This is based on the volume of sales of the product within the
member states at ex-factory prices. Fees will vary slightly between member
states.
This subject is covered by the EC regulation on the Community Ecolabel award
scheme (880/92) and applies to all products except for pharmaceuticals,
beverages and foodstuffs.
Directives affect UK employees abroad
Q: I intend shortly to establish a subsidiary in France and will be posting
at least one member of staff there. In the light of the UK's recent
abstention from the vote on the EC directive on 'Working Time', what will be
the position of a UK worker in France?
A: Although your employees will still be working for a British company, they
will be based in France and will be subject to French national legislation
as well as any relevant EC regulations and directives in force. Once the
'Working Time' directive has been formally adopted in France all employees
working for French, UK or other companies will have the legal right to:
A minimum daily rest period of 11 consecutive hours
At least one day off a week
Four weeks annual paid holiday
A restriction on night work to a maximum of an average of eight hours. The
Commission has recommended the length of nightworking be averaged over 14
days but has left a final decision to the individual member states
Mandatory daily rest breaks after six hours.
These conditions will apply in all EC member states except the UK.
However, the directive allows for exemptions if your company is involved in
the fishery, agriculture, offshore and transport industries. Community
workers will still be able to work more than 48 hours a week voluntarily if
safeguards to prevent abuse are in place. The UK's abstention will therefore
have no real affect on your staff in France.
Help with language courses
Q: I am a UK citizen living and working in Germany and would like to enrol
on a German language course. Can I apply for a grant, loan or tax relief on
such a course?
A: There are no grants, loans or tax relief available for individuals
wanting to pursue language training in Germany. But there are regional
promotion programmes designed to help German companies prepare and develop
their employees for working in the single market.
These programmes do not exist in every Land and the conditions and benefits
vary according to the development strategies of the region.
On a Community level, the increased trade, mobility and cultural exchange
which has resulted from the development of the internal market has led to
the introduction of the Lingua programme. This is an EC initiative which
promotes a more widespread understanding and use of the Community languages.
It is not a programme targeted directly at business, although the aim is to
promote foreign language skills in the workforce.
For further information contact The UK Lingua Unit, Seymour Mews House,
Seymour Mews, London WlH 9PE. Tel: 071 725 9493 Fax: 071 224 1906. The
European headquarters of the programme is at Bureau Lingua, 10 rue du
Commerce, B-1040 Brussels. Tel: 322 511 42 18 Fax: 322 511 43 76.

FT  13 JUL 93 / Technology: Going for gold
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the 19th century gold rushes, prospectors sought the seductive metal by
trudging across rough terrain and studying streams and rocks for signs of
hidden wealth.
Today, mining companies have a much more sophisticated array of data to
guide them to gold-bearing deposits. They can assemble a mass of
information, by land or air, on a region's magnetic, gravitational,
geological and chemical peculiarities and then work out where to start
drilling.
But this is where the difficulties come in. Drilling holes is expensive  -
about Dollars 50,000 (Pounds 33,000) a time, including laboratory analysis -
and there are no rules on how to use all the data to pinpoint potential
mines. However, if a computer program devised by a Sussex University
scientist is taken up widely, much of the uncertainty and cost could be
reduced.
Lecturer Peter Williams' computer neural network program - such programs
recognise patterns and trends among a dense mass of data rather than make
complex calculations - has been tried successfully by a big US mining
company. Using magnetic data from 171 drillings, it was tested on two sites.
It predicted accurately that one would yield gold and the other (thought to
have potential after 36 test drillings) would not.
It has also been used in south-east Asia and attracted interest from an
Australian mining group. Williams says his program can be used for small or
large areas and even whole countries where the magnetic and gravitational
data is available. He has developed his program over three years, but he
does not claim it will replace present methods of looking for gold.
'It is another tool in the toolbox,' he says modestly. 'It tilts the odds in
favour of the prospector.'

FT  13 JUL 93 / Technology: Drivers on the button - Almost any car could
dispense with its gear lever
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It would probably never occur to most drivers of non-automatic cars that
changing gear might be possible by pressing a button instead of having to
reach down and move a lever. Imagine being able to operate the gears as
easily as turning on the lights or windscreen wipers.
The technology is there, but has yet to be put into widely available form.
However, a start is being made by Prodrive, the UK motor sport engineering
concern which prepares some of the world's leading race and rally cars. It
has developed a road-going version of the press-button, semi-automatic
gearboxes hitherto confined to leading grand prix teams and the world
championship rally cars Prodrive operates for Subaru of Japan.
Although the system will make its off-track debut this year in one of
Italy's best-known makes of exotic sports car, it could be added to almost
any car's conventional manual gearbox. 'There is no reason why it should not
be cheaper than, say, power steering,' according to David Lapworth, managing
director of Prodrive's engineering services subsidiary.
In its current road-going form, the system is being tested by Prodrive in a
Subaru Legacy saloon. No modifications have been made to the car's
conventional gearbox. Instead, the normal clutch operating cylinder is
supplemented by an actuating mechanism whose operation is managed by an
electronic control unit (Ecu) and an air tank and small compressors located
remotely - in the Legacy's case, in the boot.
The actuating unit is about a foot long. Along with the valve system it is
small enough to have been installed in the Legacy's transmission tunnel
without modifying the bodywork.
The driver selects gears by touching buttons on the upper and lower surfaces
of the steering wheel. Specific buttons do not select specific gears.
Instead, any button on the upper surface takes the car up a gear, and any
button on the lower surface takes it down. Repeated pressing takes the car
sequentially up or down through the gears.
The clever bit lies in what the Ecu does on receiving a gear change
instruction - relayed electronically - from the driver. For upshifts, the
driver simply presses the button without either lifting his foot from the
accelerator pedal or operating the clutch pedal. The Ecu throttles back the
engine at the same time as ordering the compressor to operate the clutch.
The resultant upshift is as fast as any achievable manually by a Nigel
Mansell or Ayrton Senna.
The principles are the same for downshifts - except that the Ecu prevents
the engine being strained through over-revving, should the driver seek to
change down too early. In this event, the Ecu is capable of both 'blipping'
the accelerator and delaying the clutch operation until gear and engine
speeds are compatible.
What are the benefits? In the area of performance motoring, gears can be
changed with optimum efficiency while preserving maximum control over the
car by keeping both hands on the steering wheel. Clutch wear is also
minimised and manual operation of the clutch is required only when starting
or stopping.
Prodrive's Legacy test model retains both its clutch pedal and the
conventional gear lever - a function of its close kinship to the rally cars,
which can revert to manual clutch and gear changing as a competition 'fail
safe'. On the back roads near Prodrive's Banbury, Oxfordshire, headquarters,
it is disconcerting to have the gearshift seemingly operating itself while
the driver uses the press button system. But, as Lapworth stresses, neither
clutch pedal nor gear lever need be retained for non-sporting applications.
Preoccupation with competition - the bulk of Prodrive's business - meant the
company could not start on a road version until early last year. The
development programme has three phases:
First is the Legacy system, fitted as an aid to enthusiastic driving.
Second is a system which selects the gears itself at the appropriate moment,
depending on accelerator position - in effect a fully automatic gearbox.
This system also allows drive-away from rest.
This second phase still involves adding equipment to existing transmissions,
and would be applicable in areas such as cheaply converting ordinary cars
for use by the disabled.
But the logical final phase, points out Lapworth, would be for car makers to
manufacture gearboxes specially designed for the system. The unit cost of
these could be much lower than for conventional manual gearboxes because -
thanks to the 'autoshift' ensuring that gear and engine speeds are
compatible during changes - synchromesh and all its complicated cones and
other components could be dispensed with.
There are rival transmissions, however, which their proponents might argue
are a still more sophisticated answer to the average motorist's needs. Chief
among these is the continuously variable transmission (CVT). Already fitted
to some Ford, Fiat, Volvo, Rover Group and even Subaru models, the CVT
provides an infinitely variable number of gear ratios by means of steel
drive belts working around expandable pullers.
The theory of the CVT is that the driver depresses the accelerator according
to whether he wants maximum or mild acceleration, or a high or low cruising
speed. The engine spins up to the required number of revolutions needed to
meet these needs with maximum efficiency - and the transmission accelerates
the car in the most efficient way to 'catch up' with the accelerator
setting, and subsequently cruises the vehicle at the most economical engine
speed.
The proclaimed advantage of the CVT is that it allows the engine to operate
in its most efficient revolution band. The driver has to do no more than
engage forward or reverse; the energy-sapping losses caused by the hydraulic
torque converter of a conventional automatic transmission - which typically
produced fuel consumption 15 per cent worse than a manual as well as
weakening performance - are largely absent.
Lapworth acknowledges that the CVT is a desirable transmission. However, it
costs more than a conventional automatic transmission - and still has more
inherent energy losses than a manual transmission. 'It will become a better
proposition if and when a car maker produces both a CVT and an engine which
are specifically designed to work together,' says Lapworth. 'But if you had
to rate them in cold energy efficiency terms, on a scale of one to 10, the
manual would be at 10, fully developed CVT engine/transmission at nine and
the existing conventional automatic at six or seven.
'And if you accept that you don't need synchromesh in our type of
transmission, you could pack in six or seven gear ratios in the same space,
so that for most drivers you would have something very close to a CVT
anyway.'
Although the autoshift is currently Prodrive's only serious road car
project, Lapworth says there is much potential for applying motor
sport-based technology on a wider front - 'cars are full of things hydraulic
and mechanical which could be better controlled', he says.

FT  13 JUL 93 / Technology (Technically Speaking): Multimedia in handcuffs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM FOREMSKI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Multimedia technology has the potential to spawn large new markets in
entertainment and education, but a battle between copyright holders and
multimedia publishers threatens to obstruct the emerging market.
Multimedia developers see great potential in the use of CD-Rom discs to
store thousands of audio, video, graphics and text clips. Organised as an
interactive encyclopedia, adventure game or as a multimedia history of
Christopher Columbus, for example, they become powerful educational and
reference tools, allowing users to steer through enormous amounts of
information easily and quickly.
But developers of such applications complain that copyright holders are
asking large fees for the use of small snippets of existing audio or video
from tape and film libraries and that the copyright licensing process is
complex and time consuming.
In turn, copyright holders are worried about the integrity of their work,
which when transformed into digital form can very easily be copied or
modified. Writers, film-makers, artists and photographers fear they might
lose control of their works and their ability to collect future royalties.
The US Office of Technology Assessment has recognised the problem. In a
report issued last year, it warned that the development of multimedia
programs could be hurt by current copyright regulations that are not well
suited to the new technologies.
Multimedia title developers say they are willing to pay for copyright
clearances, but simply locating copyright holders is a big problem. Warner
New Media, for example, when developing a multimedia title on the Berlin
Wall, wanted to use a clip from the musical film West Side Story. This
involved obtaining and paying for copyright clearance from the film company,
the musicians, the music composer, the actors and the writers. But Warner
missed a copyright, held by the choreographer, and could not use the clip.
One loophole some multimedia developers have successfully used is the 'fair
use' provision of US copyright law. This allows use of a copyrighted work
'for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching,
including multiple copies for classroom use, scholarship, or research'.
However, US courts have interpreted fair use in unpredictable ways. Last
year, for example, a US federal court ruled against Texaco which had argued
that in photocopying scientific papers, it was protected from copyright
infringement allegations since the papers were used for research.
With fair use vaguely defined by US courts, many multimedia applications
developers are looking for copyright-free material. The largest source of
copyright-free text is Project Gutenberg. It offers 50 copyright-free
publications in digital form, known as 'etexts'. These include classic books
such as Alice in Wonderland and Peter Pan. Michael Hart, founder of Project
Gutenberg, says it will offer 10,000 etexts by the end of the decade.
Multimedia title developers can also turn to a growing number of CD-Rom
disks full of music clips, photographs and video footage, all available
without copyright fees.
None the less, copyright-free or public domain material is a limited
resource. A copyright clearance mechanism is needed that allows copyright
holders to tap into the potentially lucrative multimedia applications market
without surrendering control over their work. Multimedia title producers, in
turn, need an easy way to reach copyright holders and negotiate copyright
clearance fees.
One solution could be the creation of copyright clearance centres that would
represent the works of artists, musicians, photographers, video producers
and authors. Such centres would allow multimedia developers to shop for
content and pay a reasonable fee for the material used. The benefits of such
a system would be to remove roadblocks to a new industry that could provide
consumers with a wide range of multimedia titles.

FT  13 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Insurance firms set for tax change
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHANGES in the tax treatment of insurance companies are to be outlined in a
consultation document, Mr Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary to the
Treasury, told MPs last night.
Earlier Miss Betty Boothroyd, the speaker, had rejected Labour demands that
44 Tory MPs who are Lloyd's Names - individuals whose capital backs the
insurance market - should be barred from voting on provisions in the Finance
Bill which would affect the tax treatment of Lloyd's.
Mr Dorrell emphasised that the effect of the move was tax-neutral. The
proposals open the possibility of limiting charges on insurance companies'
premium income to facilitate the build-up of a reserve fund to meet future
catastrophes.
Mr Dorrell explained that the consultation document, to be published during
the summer, would deal with whether insurance companies should continue to
be taxed on the basis of annually declared profit.
Mr Dorrell said it could be argued that it was not sensible to levy tax on
the profit from annual premiums when the claims they were intended to cover
could materialise during a later period. He emphasised that in the case of
Lloyd's there would be a limit of 50 per cent on the amount of premium
income which was not subject to tax.
Miss Boothroyd ruled that the rule requiring MPs not to vote on matters in
which they had a personal pecuniary interest did not apply to a public bill
so long as other similarly situated persons would benefit in the same way.
She stressed that the provisions in the bill were not confined to members of
Lloyd's who were also MPs.
MPs will be asked to give the Finance Bill a third reading today.

FT  13 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Peers clash as Maastricht pressure
grows
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS and ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR was last night under pressure from pro-European ministers to
declare that he is ready if necessary to risk the imposition in Britain of
the social chapter rather than abandon ratification of the Maastricht
treaty.
The mobilisation of the Europhiles in the Tory party was also reflected in
the counter-attack by Conservative heavyweights against Lady Thatcher's
decision to vote for a referendum on Maastricht when the issue is put to the
House of Lords tomorrow.
Downing Street refused to comment on mounting speculation at Westminster
that a combination of opposition parties and rebellious Tory Euro-sceptics
could defeat the government in a Commons vote on the social chapter on July
26.
Euro-sceptics described a government defeat as 'a racing certainty' even if
ministers managed to persuade some unionist MPs not to vote with the
opposition.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, was said to be among the ministers who
want Mr Major to make it clear in advance of the vote that whatever the
outcome the government will press ahead with ratification.
The ministers hope that such a threat will dissuade the Euro-sceptics from
voting for the inclusion of the social chapter in the belief that Mr Major
would then abandon the treaty.
But Mr Clarke is said to be among a majority who believe that even if the
government is defeated it should press ahead with ratification. Initially
the government could ignore the Commons vote - as it is technically outside
the ratification legislation - but it might then be open to a legal
challenge to the social chapter opt-out.
The pro-European majority in the cabinet is arguing that if the UK were then
forced to abandon the opt-out, the blame would fall directly on the
Euro-sceptics. Ways of minimising the controversy of ratifying the treaty,
even after a Commons defeat, are at the heart of contingency plans being
drawn up by the government.
One proposal is for a vote of confidence to be taken immediately after any
defeat. This would bring back into line at least some of the Tory rebels,
and might be framed to include an endorsement of the government's stance on
the social chapter.
Sir Nicholas Lyell, the attorney-general, is said to have advised colleagues
that ratifying the treaty in spite of a defeat would not worsen the
government's position in the threatened Euro-sceptic attempt to seek
judicial review of what the government has done so far in its pursuit of
ratification.
Tory sensitivities about Maastricht were underlined as former cabinet
ministers accused Lady Thatcher of disloyalty, even though the government is
confident that her call for a referendum will be defeated.
Lord Howe, the former chancellor and foreign secretary, said that if her
predecessor had led an organised rebellion during her own premiership, then
she would have regarded it as 'pretty disloyal'.
He gave a warning that to embark on a referendum campaign would be 'total
folly'.
Lord Gilmour rejected Lady Thatcher's assertion that her support for a
Maastricht referendum would not be an attack on Mr John Major.
The pro-referendum lobby stepped up its pressure yesterday. Lord Blake, the
Tory historian who will move the amendment, called it a campaign of 'peers
for the people'.

FT  13 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Compensation urged for fuel VAT
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH and IVOR OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GOVERNMENT advisers yesterday urged ministers to make an extra Pounds 400m a
year available to people on social security benefits to compensate for the
imposition of value added tax on domestic fuel.
And in the Commons last night the government's majority was cut to 8
(307-299) when three Tory backbenchers joined with opposition MPs in voting
against the extension of the tax.
Mr William Powell (C Corby), who moved an amendment to remove the relevant
provision from the Finance Bill, was accompanied by Mr Nicholas Winterton (
C Macclesfield), and Mr Geoffrey Dickens ( C Littleborough and Saddleworth)
in voting against the government.
Anxiety among Treasury ministers was heightened when it became clear that a
number of government supporters, including Mr John Biffen, MP for Shropshire
north and a former cabinet minister, had failed to reach the Chamber before
the doors to the voting lobbies were locked.
Mr Powell was cheered by Labour backbenchers when he recalled that during
last year's general election the Conservative party gave an unequivocal
promise that VAT would not be extended to domestic fuel.
He said: 'I also gave that promise to my own constituents - I meant it and I
propose to keep it'.
The report from the social security advisory committee said increases
promised by the impact of the VAT on the formula for benefits would meet
only 'something under half' of higher fuel bills.
It estimated that compensating some 8m people for higher fuel bills once the
full rate of VAT was charged from 1995 would cost about Pounds 720m.
Calling the additional Pounds 400m a 'modest proportion' of the revenue
expected to be generated from the VAT increase, the report said: 'We would
hope that Treasury ministers can be convinced that this unavoidable increase
in the social security budget is fully justified and should not be seen as
an increase in public expenditure.'
The committee urged a look at how people on benefits unrelated to income
could be compensated. This has particularly worried Tory MPs concerned at
the plight of pensioners whose savings or income makes them ineligible for
income support.

FIVE CLAIMS for compensation by veterans of British nuclear tests are
pending, Mr Jeremy Hanley, armed forces minister, said last night.
But he also insisted that there was no new evidence to suggest previous
assurances that all personnel involved in the tests 'received little or no
radiation' were wrong.
He said the five claims were being examined, but added:
'So far, no case of death or disease among British nuclear test veterans has
been shown to have resulted from radiation from the tests.'

<TEXT>
SCHOOL support staff in a flagship Conservative local authority last night
voted to hold a strike ballot in protest at wage cuts.
A walkout by the 700 workers in the London borough of Wandsworth would close
all its primary and special schools, unions claimed. A meeting of workers
including meal supervisors, transport attendants and special school helpers
voted unanimously to hold a strike ballot over the next few weeks. Strike
action could hit the schools in September.
A council spokesman said the planned pay cuts affected workers once employed
by ILEA and on higher rates than those paid by Wandsworth.

<TEXT>
SHELL UK is scaling down its North Sea oil drilling programme and cutting
jobs in its exploration department by between 20 and 30 per cent. But the
company yesterday denied this was a result of the government's planned
changes to Petroleum Revenue Taxes.
'The PRT changes have underlined and given focus to what we were already
looking at in the North Sea,' the company said.
The changes, which abolish tax relief on exploration drilling while cutting
the tax rate for existing fields from 75 per cent to 50 per cent, are due to
become law in about a month.
Six senior Tory MPs yesterday tabled an amendment to to introduce a
transition period of three years.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR Nicholas Lyell, the attorney-general, yesterday disclosed that eight MPs
 -more than previously thought - had made representations to ministers about
the case of Mr Asil Nadir, the fugitive former chairman of Polly Peck.
But he dismissed demands to name all the MPs concerned.
Of the eight, Sir Nicholas said, four had written or spoken to him or to his
predecessor, Sir Patrick Mayhew, in the past two years.
In a written parliamentary reply, Sir Nicholas explained the figure had
risen to eight with the inclusion of letters written by two MPs to the then
home secretary.
So far, Mr Michael Mates, the ex-Northern Ireland minister who resigned over
the affair, Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, Mr Peter
Lloyd, Home Office minister, and Mr Peter Brooke, the national heritage
secretary and Mr Nadir's MP, have been identified as having contacted the
attorney-general over the case.

FT  13 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Rifkind fails to ease Rosyth fears
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SCOTTISH fears about the long term future of the Rosyth dockyard seemed
unlikely to be allayed yesterday, after Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence
secretary, admitted that he was unable to guarantee entirely the surface
naval work that the government has promised to allocate Rosyth to ensure the
dockyard's survival.
The promises of the work, which entail the refitting of 18 major warships
and 49 minor naval vessels over the next 12 years, were made by Mr Rifkind
last week, as the government announced that Rosyth had lost its two-year
battle with Devonport dockyard for the lucrative nuclear submarine refitting
work, estimated at some Pounds 3bn to Pounds 5bn over the next 20 years.
Mr Rifkind told the Commons' defence committee yesterday that although the
government had a strong commitment to allocating the surface refitting work
to Rosyth, the details of this commitment could not be guaranteed until the
future management of the yard had been decided.
'You can't have a contractual agreement without a contractor,' Mr Rifkind
said.
The Rosyth yard is run by Babcock Thorn, a private consortium. However the
government is due to re-assess its contract in two years' time and is
considering a range of options, including the possible privatisation of the
yard.
Faced with accusations that the Ministry of Defence had not matched up to
its allocation promises to other dockyards in recent years, Mr Rifkind
insisted that the government's promises for surface work should be
sufficient to guarantee Rosyth's survival.
His arguments did little to placate opposition MPs, who accused Mr Rifkind
of under-estimating the job losses, predicted to be 350 for Devonport and
450 at Rosyth.

FT  13 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Ashdown calls for 'dialogue' on
reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR PADDY Ashdown last night called for a 'constructive dialogue' on
constitutional change between the Liberal Democrat and Labour parties to
counter the electorate's growing disenchantment with politics and
politicians.
But the Liberal Democrat leader warned that 'half-hearted' Labour support
for radical reform of Britain's outdated political system could bring a
repeat of the damaging uncertainty which helped the Conservatives win last
year's general election.
In a speech to Charter 88, the independent pressure group, Mr Ashdown
floated two other ideas - consultative referenda for important issues and
the inclusion in government of talented individuals from outside parliament
 -to strengthen public involvement in decision-making.
Mr Ashdown warned that disillusionment among voters with the government had
widened into a general distrust of politicians of all parties.
He said Britain faced not only a crisis of government and of leadership but
also a 'crisis of democracy' resulting from the failure of its political
institutions to maintain the respect and confidence of its citizens.
Mr Ashdown, setting out his platform for constitutional reform, said that at
the core of the crisis was a system which centralised power in Whitehall and
treated citizens as passive 'subjects' rather than active participants in
political life.
The Liberal Democrat leader, promoting the case for reform of the voting
system, a written constitution and bill of rights, and devolution of power
to regional and local government, said other ways were also needed to
'bridge the gap that is opening up between government and governed'.
Mr Ashdown welcomed the commitment to constitutional change offered by Mr
John Smith, the Labour leader. He set his own speech last night in the
context of a contribution to a 'continuing constructive dialogue between our
two parties and others on constitutional matters'.
He said a cross-party consensus offered the only route to the overhaul a
19th century model which had 'hit the limits of its own utility'. But if
Labour were going to advocate change they 'must start to behave as if they
are committed to change'.

FT  13 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Lib Dems touch nerve over rail
privatisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OFF-PEAK rail services to Christchurch are to be cut by half from this
autumn, the Liberal Democrats claimed yesterday as rail privatisation and
law and order dominated opening exchanges in the first week of by-election
campaigning.
Mr Nick Harvey, MP for Devon North and the party's transport spokesman, said
off-peak services from London to the Dorset seaside town would be 'slashed'
from two trains per hour to one from October as part of a 'slim-down' to
pave the way for privatisation.
As the party sought to exploit discontent at the government's sell-off
plans, Mrs Diana Maddock, the Liberal Democrat candidate, released the
results of a survey showing an overwhelming majority of local people wanted
through ticketing and discount cards to continue after privatisation.
'It is all too apparent that rail privatisation has become one of the most
unpopular policies of an already unpopular government,' Mrs Maddock said.
As Network SouthEast said its winter timetable plans had yet to be
finalised, Mr Robert Hayward, the Tory candidate, described the predictions
of impending service cuts as 'speculation'.
Mr Hayward - the former MP for Kingswood and a strong supporter of rail
privatisation - has made no bones about his views on the subject being very
different from those of rail enthusiast Mr Robert Adley, the maverick Tory
MP whose death prompted the by-election.
The Conservatives, who are defending a majority of 23,000 in what promises
to be a crucial test of Mr John Major's battered authority, used a visit by
Mr David Maclean, a home office minister, to attack the Liberal Democrats'
record on law and order, described by Mr Maclean as the 'key issue' of the
July 29 by-election.
But with no member of the cabinet having yet set foot in Christchurch, there
is an impression the Tory campaign has got off to a slow start.
Law and order was also touched on by Labour during a visit by Mrs Margaret
Beckett, the deputy leader. Mr Nigel Lickley, the Labour candidate, said
Labour had recently tabled proposals in the Commons that would aid crime
prevention, reduce crime and curb offending while on bail.

FT  13 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Smith faces union deadlock over
party reform - The problems facing the Labour leader's agenda for change
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
  By DAVID GOODHART and RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN APPARENT concession by Labour leader John Smith in his confrontation with
the trade unions yesterday alarmed some of Labour's 'moderniser' MPs as it
became clear that the party leader's battle has entered a complex period of
manoeuvre.
Mr Smith has remained firm on his call for 'one member, one vote' in the
selection of Labour parliamentary candidates. But his weekend promise that
individual trade union members who pay the political levy would continue to
vote in leadership elections led to fears that Mr Smith would be seen as
having given ground. 'It is a tactical blunder,' said one MP.
But the clash is not a matter of black versus white. Nor is Mr Smith's
predicament as deep as it might seem - even though a decisive majority of
trade unionists are now ranged against his proposals.
For a start, the reforms on which the Labour conference will vote on are not
yet clear. Mr Smith's idea of a register of Labour-supporting trade union
members as part of a electoral college for leadership elections have not yet
been detailed.
The party's trade union links committee meets tomorrow and will agree a
report for presenting to Labour's ruling National Executive Committee on
Monday. There, Mr Smith will probably win a small majority for plans which
will be submitted to the conference in September.
The thinking among Mr Smith's aides is that once proposed reforms are
documented, the leadership will be in a better position to sell its line.
Moreover, there is a belief within Mr Smith's camp that some of his
opponents are potential waverers on the selection of parliamentary
candidates. Aides believe the conference delegations from three out of the
big six unions affiliated to Labour - Nupe, the public service union, Usdaw,
the shopworkers' union and MSF, the white collar union - could be persuaded
to shift position to one-member-one-vote (OMOV). That might be enough to
swing the vote in the Labour leader's favour.
Another possibility, backed by some members of Labour's shadow cabinet, is a
fudge between a 'register' of supporters in the unions, backed in principle
by Nupe and the GMB, and Mr Smith's insistance on trade union members paying
something extra, above the political levy, to become full Labour party
members. Levy-paying trade unionists could become full members by, say,
paying a nominal sum of 50p and promising to support the aims of the Labour
party.
Perhaps more likely is that division among the trade unions opposed to OMOV
for parliamentary selections will result in the conference ending in
impasse. Mrs Margaret Beckett, Labour's deputy leader, yesterday said there
were about 25 different options being floated for reforms. It might be that
none of the motions will be passed.
The chances of a stalemate are quite strong. A motion backing the status quo
from the TGWU or one of the small left-wing unions will almost certainly
fall because the GMB general union and Nupe will both reject it. But their
own variations of reform - a register of Labour supporters among levy payers
from Nupe and a reform of the local electoral college from the GMB - will
also probably be defeated by a combination of status quo camp and Smith
supporters.
The NEC, which narrowly favours OMOV, would then be in a strong position to
present a resolution which supports Mr Smith. The less attractive option for
the Smith camp is that supporters of the status quo shift their support to
the register idea rather than accept OMOV.

FT  13 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: G7 backs benefits restraint, says
PM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR yesterday claimed growing international recognition of the
need to rein in the escalating cost of state-funded social provision, Philip
Stephens writes.
In a statement to MPs on the outcome of the Tokyo summit, the prime minister
said that the seven leading industrial nations had also endorsed Britain's
call for increased de-regulation and labour market flexibility to halt the
rise in structural unemployment.
But he faced calls from Labour leader Mr John Smith for an immediate cut in
interest rates to bring down the jobless total. Mr Smith said he welcomed
the recognition that there was insufficient growth and too much unemployment
and called for 'closely co-ordinated international action' to combat both
problems.
Mr Major's comments came as Downing Street refused to rule out the
possibility that the government's long-term spending review could suggest
the eventual replacement of the basic state pension with private insurance
schemes.
Officials, however, said that there was no question of the government
abandoning during this parliament its commitment to a universal state
pension uprated annually in line with inflation.
Mr Major said the agreement negotiated in Tokyo to restart the Gatt world
trade talks had reawakened the prospect of a deal by the end of this year to
complete the stalled Uruguay round.
But Mr Major acknowledged that there were serious obstacles to be overcome
on services and agriculture before a Gatt deal could be signed.

FT  13 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Shell set to cut jobs in N Sea oil
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHELL UK is scaling down its North Sea oil drilling programme and cutting
jobs in its exploration department by between 20 and 30 per cent. But the
company yesterday denied this was a result of the government's planned
changes to Petroleum Revenue Taxes.
'The PRT changes have underlined and given focus to what we were already
looking at in the North Sea,' the company said.
An earlier memorandum sent to Shell employees referred to the fact that the
tax changes will increase exploration costs by a factor of four, emphasising
the need for cost-cutting measures. Shell has already begun a worldwide
campaign to trim costs in an effort to improve profitability at a time of
low oil prices.
The changes, which abolish tax relief on exploration drilling while cutting
the tax rate for existing fields from 75 per cent to 50 per cent, are due to
become law in about a month.
Six senior Tory MPs yesterday tabled an amendment to to introduce a
transition period of three years.
Many oil companies have opposed the changes because they believe up to
30,000 job losses in the sector could result from the subsequent downturn in
exploration drilling.
But Shell has always publicly supported the changes by saying the reduction
in drilling would be offset by an increase in development work.
An official at Shell called the reference to PRT in the company's memo
'rather unfortunate', but said that the rest of the memo made clear the job
cuts were due to long-term structural changes within the company.
The cuts in Shell's 200-strong workforce in the exploration department will
take place by the end of next year.
The Treasury is believed to have contacted the company over its apparent
change of tone over the PRT issue. The company stressed that its support for
the new PRT rules was unchanged.

FT  13 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Five N-test claims for compensation
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FIVE CLAIMS for compensation by veterans of British nuclear tests are
pending, Mr Jeremy Hanley, minister for the armed forces, said last night.
But he also insisted that there was no new evidence to suggest previous
assurances that all personnel involved in the tests 'received little or no
radiation' were wrong.
In a Commons written reply he said the five claims were being examined in
the usual way to see whether there was any evidence of exposure to radiation
'and if so whether this caused any subsequent disease'.
He added: 'So far however, no case of death or disease among British nuclear
test veterans has been shown to have resulted from radiation from the
tests.'

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
NOTTINGHAMSHIRE Police confirmed yesterday that fraud squad officers were
investigating the affairs of a coal haulage company and its subsidiaries in
which the Union of Democratic Mineworkers had a minority shareholding.
National Plant and Transport, the group involved, was owned by a Nottingham
business family which had close contractual arrangements with British Coal
during the 1984-85 miners' strike.
Mining Skills, the subsidiary, is at the centre of the inquiry. It was 49
per cent owned by the union but the UDM's involvement is not believed to be
part of the investigation.
Police are looking at transactions between Mining Skills and the factoring
subsidiaries of two banks, Confidential Invoice Discounting, of Lloyds Bank,
and RoyScot, part of the Royal Bank of Scotland.

FT  13 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: 8 MPs wrote to ministers on Nadir
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR Nicholas Lyell, the attorney-general, yesterday disclosed that eight MPs
 -more than previously thought - had made representations to ministers about
the case of Mr Asil Nadir, the fugitive Polly Peck boss.
But he dismissed demands to name all the MPs concerned.
Of the eight, Sir Nicholas said, four had written or spoken to him or to his
predecessor, Sir Patrick Mayhew, in the past two years.
In a written parliamentary reply, Sir Nicholas explained the figure had
risen to eight with the inclusion of letters written by two MPs to the then
home secretary. Sir Patrick had replied to these letters on various points.
So far, Mr Michael Mates, the ex-Northern Ireland Minister who resigned over
the affair, Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, Mr Peter
Lloyd, Home Office minister, and Mr Peter Brooke, the national heritage
secretary and Mr Nadir's MP, have been publicly identified as having
contacted the attorney-general over the case.
Sir Nicholas, speaking earlier in the Commons, said that while political
donations were not his responsibility, 'what this case makes abundantly
clear is that it does certainly not produce any favour or affection, either
way, whatever party may be involved'.

FT  13 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Labour deputy leader 'nervous'
about pension privatisation scheme
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MRS MARGARET Beckett, Labour's deputy leader, said yesterday she would be
'very nervous' about any move to enable people to opt out of the basic state
pension scheme.
Campaigning in Christchurch, she said private pensions were 'admirable as
long as they are something that give people the freedom to top up' the basic
state scheme.
While Labour favoured improving the current system to take account of
contemporary family and work patterns, it was not looking for savings at the
expense of 'people already struggling with their pensions'.
Her remarks came after Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, welcomed
proposals by Labour MP Mr Frank Field - chairman of the Commons' social
security committee - for privatising state pensions. Mr Lilley said the
basic pension would remain as a 'building block'.

FT  13 JUL 93 / Church may have to cut clergy, synod told
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SERIOUS FINANCIAL problems will force the Church of England to examine
issues as fundamental as the number of full-time clergy it employs, its
General Synod was told yesterday.
The Right Reverend John Wayne, Bishop of Chelmsford and chairman of the
Lambeth Group - a committee examining issues arising from the investment
management of the church commissioners - told the synod that the Church's
financial problems were likely to become 'even more difficult in the short
term'.
The problems have been brought to a head by a drop in the capital value of
the church commissioners' property-dominated investment portfolio. Total
value of income-producing assets fell from nearly Pounds 3bn in 1989 to
Pounds 2.16bn last year.
Criticism of the commissioners, who are responsible for handling the
Church's main investments, led to the establishment of the Bishop of
Chelmsford's group last year. But even before publication of its report the
bishop set out some of the choices the Church will face.
During the early 1980s, he said, the commissioners had financed better
stipends, pensions, retirement housing and other benefits for its clergy. As
a result, the Church had become too reliant on the commissioners.
'We became ever more ready to embark upon good and desirable work without
facing up to the costs, or our ability or readiness to pay for it.' The
Church had to look at such questions as the number of stipendiary clergy it
needed, and might become increasingly dependent on a non-stipendiary
ministry.
Urgent action, said the bishop, must be taken to increase contributions from
Church members, which did not compare with other churches. The Church of
England needed to move rapidly towards making the majority of parishes
self-financing. 'There can be little justification for the commissioners'
money being used to assist parishes which scarcely need their help.'
The average level of stipends financed by the commissioners - currently 41
per cent - is likely to fall to below 30 per cent by 1996. Mr John
Smallwood, a commissioner, told yesterday's meeting that parishes would have
to meet up to 90 per cent of clergy salaries by the end of the decade.
Mr Michael Colman, chairman of Reckitt &amp; Colman and the recently appointed
first church estates commissioner, admitted that he shared the reservations
of speakers who were concerned about the size of the commissioners' holdings
in property and gilts. About half the commissioners' investments are in
property - a much higher proportion than most investment institutions. Sir
Michael said he did not see justification for the Church risking the market
exposure this level of investment created.

FT  13 JUL 93 / Rover sales rise as rivals suffer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ROVER GROUP was the only large vehicle maker to increase sales in
continental Europe in the first half of the year. They rose 5 per cent to
65,500.
The British Aerospace subsidiary also increased its worldwide sales by 13
per cent in the period - helped by a 44 per cent sales rise in Japan, where
the new-car market is suffering the first notable reverse in its history.
Rover's Japanese sales rise is from a small base - up from 4,300 to 6,200 -
but Rover executives see it as cause for further celebration following
Honda's decision to sell the Land Rover Discovery model in Japan badged as a
Honda - the first time a western manufacturer's model has received such an
endorsement.
Helped by sharp increases in other export markets outside Europe, Rover's
total sales in the first half rose to 202,100 from 178,300 in the same
period a year ago. UK sales were up 14 per cent, at 119,700, and export
sales were 12 per cent higher at 82,400.
Rover's total export sales outside Europe were up 54 per cent, to 16,900
units.
The increase in continental European sales came in the face of estimates
from the European Automobile Manufacturers Association last week that the
combined total sales in 17 west European markets were down by 17.5 per cent
in the first half of the year.
In spite of the collapse in the German new-car market, where sales were down
more than 20 per cent in the first half, Rover increased its sales in
Germany by 6 per cent and plans to double the size of its German dealer
network over the next two years.

FT  13 JUL 93 / Henry Cooper sells Lonsdale belts
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SALE of three Lonsdale Belts won by former heavyweight boxing champion
Henry Cooper, was completed yesterday.
The boxer was forced to sell the belts to meet losses at Lloyd's of London,
where he was a Name. He stopped underwriting in 1985 and resigned from the
market in 1989. Mr Cooper was a member of a number of syndicates, including
at least one managed by the Oakeley Vaughan agency, which made heavy losses
in the early 1980s.
The belts were sold at a Sotheby's sale of sporting memorabilia held at Kent
County Cricket Club's ground in Canterbury and fetched Pounds 42,000 against
an expected price of Pounds 70,000.
Mr Cooper, undefeated British boxing champion for 11 years from 1959, won
the belts in 1959, 1964 and 1967.
He is the only boxer of any weight to have won three Lonsdale belts
outright. A belt is awarded for three successful British title defences.

JUDGMENT was reserved yesterday in the High Court case of a former Reuters

repetitive strain injury working on computer keyboards. The judge is
expected to announce his ruling in early September.
Mr Rafiq Mughal, whose action is backed by the NUJ journalists union, has
claimed Reuters failed to take heed of warnings issued by the Health and
Safety Executive and other bodies about the dangers of using new technology.
The action is seen by the NUJ as a test case with important implications for
a series of similar pending cases. These include a number being brought
against the Financial Times by some of its current and former journalists.

Mr Peter Smith, the association's general-secretary, wants the new Funding
Agency for Schools to be given a guarantee of independence. He said the

Consultation with members in both grant-maintained and local authority

FT  13 JUL 93 / Insurance company alters flexitime
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CLERICAL MEDICAL, the insurer, has abandoned its system of flexitime,
reports the latest bulletin from Industrial Relations Services, the
independent pay analysts, David Goodhart writes.
Flexitime allows employees to decide their own hours of work around a core
time specified by the company. Clerical and Medical said it had moved to a
system of paying people to do a job rather than to sit at a desk for a fixed
number of hours. This new culture clashed with the notion of 'counting hours
and minutes' inherent in pure flexitime systems.
It has run a flexitime system since 1975 for 1,200 of its 1,600 staff, but
said it had had to change as a result of growing competitive pressures.
The bulletin also reports on a survey of 123 organisations into fixed-term
contracts. This found that on average only 2.5 per cent of staff were
employed on such contracts with their use concentrated in the public sector.

FT  13 JUL 93 / BBC regions to get 170 new jobs
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BBC yesterday announ-ced what it described as its largest ever single
investment in regional journalism with the creation of 170 new posts at a
cost of Pounds 5.5m a year.
The announcement was made by Mr Ron Neil, managing director of regional
broadcasting, on the eve of this year's Radio Academy Festival in
Birmingham.
Mr Neil said the money, part of a Pounds 40m package of investments in
programmes across all radio and television this year, had been funded
entirely from savings.
The jobs, to be advertised internally and externally, are made up of:
41 new regional bi-media radio and television correspondents in areas such
as health and education.
90 extra news producer posts deployed across the BBC's 39 local radio
stations.
A new researcher post on every local radio station to improve planning.

FT  13 JUL 93 / Sky TV plans art and sport channels
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SKY TELEVISION is looking at the possibility of launching two new satellite
channels next year - a second sports channel and an arts channel, Raymond
Snoddy writes.
Mr David Elstein, Sky's director of programmes, said the satellite
broadcaster had rights to many more hours of sports coverage than it could
get on a single channel.
'I also personally would like to see an arts channel,' said Mr Elstein.
One of the main barriers to an arts channel showing largely UK performances
would be agreement with Equity, the actors' union, and the Musicians Union
on performance and copyright fees.
Mr Elstein suggested yesterday that the performance unions could be involved
in the channel and given 30 per cent of the equity instead of copyright
payments.
Sky Television, in which Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, has a
significant interest, will start offering 14 channels in a subscription
package from September, and hopes to increase this to as many as 20 channels
by early next year.

FT  13 JUL 93 / SFA reports sharp fall in complaints
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Securities and Futures Authority, the self-regulating body for
stockbrokers and futures groups, yesterday said that complaints against
members and claims paid on behalf of members from the Investors Compensation
Scheme had both fallen sharply during the past year.
The authority's annual accounts for the year to March 31 showed that it
received 421 complaints relating to 143 groups, compared with 542 the
previous year. But it said that the complexity of complaints and the
tendency of complainants to seek the aid of lawyers had grown.
The total cost to authority members following complaints covered by the
compensation scheme fell to Pounds 600,000 from Pounds 3.4m in 1991-92.
Mr Christopher Sharples, the authority's chairman, said the authority hoped
that the current review of the compensation scheme's financing would
eliminate the element of cross-subsidy between different authorities in the
industry. At present SFA members, who are engaged in wholesale business,
underwrite a portion of claims against businesses in retail financial
services.
The authority is considering raising the maximum compensation which can be
paid to claimants if cross-subsidisa-tion is eliminated, he said.
The authority recorded an after-tax deficit of Pounds 714,000, partly
reflecting lower subscription receipts, although these were offset by lower
administration costs. The loss was covered by reserves. Operating expenses
for 1993-94 are expected to be lower than the year which has just ended.

FT  13 JUL 93 / Names struggle to meet submissions deadline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEW EFFORTS to find an out-of-court settlement to legal disputes at Lloyd's
of London are running into difficulties, casting a shadow over efforts to
restore profitability at the insurance market.
Seventy one groups of loss-making Names - the individuals backing
underwriting at Lloyd's - were invited last week to submit statements to Sir
Michael Kerr, the former High Court judge who is chairing a panel set up to
assess Names' claims of negligence against their agents.
Names claim that a deadline of July 23 is unrealistic and will not allow
them to consult legal counsel. Mr David Tiplady, a solicitor representing
four groups of Names, said: 'It is impossible.'
Mr Tiplady is pressing the panel to put back its deadline to mid-August. But
Mr Bill Knight, of solicitors Simmons &amp; Simmons, which is working with the
panel, stressed that the deadline was a 'hard' one. He said the panel would
be unable to report to Lloyd's by the autumn unless it stuck to this
deadline.
Lloyd's, which last month reported its third successive year of record
losses, is keen to settle litigation with Names in order to restore
confidence as it seeks to attract fresh capital.
Separately, Mr Michael Deeny, chairman of the Gooda Walker Names Action
group, the biggest group of loss-making Names, said his group would meet the
deadline but 'smaller less well-financed groups' would be disadvantaged.
Mr Deeny, who is also on a second panel which is examining the potential
financial resources available for a settlement, said he was 'sceptical'
about its chances of success.
He said the errors and omissions insurers - which cover Lloyd's agencies
against awards for negligence - were only prepared to consider a settlement
which would not 'trigger their own reinsurance protections'. Since errors
and omissions insurers - themselves Lloyd's syndicates - usually buy
reinsurance, the amount available to settle claims would be limited.
Mr Deeny said: 'At the end of the day all the arm-twisting by the Lloyd's
management hasn't got anywhere. The only solution is to get a court judgment
and put 30 to 40 agencies into liquidation.'

FT  13 JUL 93 / Daily Mirror spikes The Sun's guns
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE first day of the tabloid circulation war saw the Daily Mirror, priced at
10p, selling out; The Sun, down 5p to 20p, having a rise in sales; while the
Daily Star, unchanged at 25p, was seriously squeezed.
Wholesalers said the price cuts and the attendant publicity increased
yesterday's overall sale of mass-market newspapers.
The Sun's promotional campaign was clearly hit by the Daily Mirror's spoiler
of charging 10p for one day's issue.
The Daily Mirror, which normally sells about 2.7m papers, claimed victory,
saying it had sold about 500,000 extra copies - a rise of about 20 per cent.
It is due to return to its usual 27p cover price today, while The Sun
intends to stick at 20p for the rest of the summer.
The Sun, which dismissed the Daily Mirror's move as a 'one-day gimmick',
said it had sold between 275,000 and 280,000 extra copies - it usually sells
about 3.5m copies a day.
News International, which owns The Sun, said it was happy with the results
so far and added that the picture would be clearer by the middle of the
week.
The Daily Star is estimated to have lost as much as 10 per cent of its
normal daily sale of about 800,000.
As the circulation battle raged, Mr Kelvin MacKenzie, editor of The Sun, and
Mr David Banks, his counterpart at the Daily Mirror, traded insults.
Mr Banks ridiculed The Sun's claim that the price cut was designed to beat
the recession. He suggested that The Sun had contributed to the recession by
'single-handedly' ensuring four Conservative election wins.
Mr MacKenzie replied the only reason the Mirror was not cutting its price
was that its senior executives had such enormous share options they didn't
want to see the share price go down.
Mirror Group Newspapers share price closed 14p down yesterday at 153p and
News International shares closed down 1p at 215p.
There was scepticism in the newspaper industry about the wisdom of the move.
'Midsummer madness,' said one specialist. 'The real question is how many of
the extra sales will be retained when the price goes up again.'

FT  13 JUL 93 / Manchester buses to be privatised
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GM BUSES, the biggest of the seven English metropolitan passenger transport
companies formed in 1986 as part of bus deregulation, is to be split into
two businesses, each of which will be sold.
The company is owned by 10 local authorities through the Greater Manchester
Passenger Transport Authority and covers a conurbation of about 2.5m people
with a fleet of more than 1,600 buses. Annual revenue exceeds Pounds 110m.
The split and sale is one of the biggest bus privatisations attempted so far
and will attract interest because of the planned privatisation of London
Buses' 10 operating subsidiaries later this year.
GM Buses says it has about 70 competitors in Greater Manchester. After
mergers and takeovers involving other bus companies, it is the UK's fourth
largest bus company outside London.
One GM business will have more than 900 buses and its routes are expected to
bring in an operating revenue of about Pounds 60m a year. The other business
will have 700 buses and should earn about Pounds 50m annually.

FT  13 JUL 93 / Rural folk step warily into computer future: Kington, a
small town on the Welsh border, has become the focus of a communications
project
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
KINGTON, folded into the hills along the border of Wales and Herefordshire,
is trying for the third time to become a significant communications centre.
Once it was a servicing stop for sheep and shepherds en route from the Welsh
hills to Birmingham. Later it was touted as a rail hub, the Crewe of the
west, when trains seemed the answer to all transport problems. Now its
future is tied, experimentally at least, to a computer and
telecommunications network called the Kington Connected Community Project.
Apple Computer provides the machines. British Telecommunications links them
to each other and the outside world. The Department of Trade and Industry
and the Rural Development Commission, anxious about economic development,
give helping hands. A happy confluence of mixed motives gives Kington access
to Pounds 250,000 worth of equipment and technical expertise.
Local residents have drawn up a shopping list of computer applications
which, if they work, would make Kington both an economic model for other
rural communities and a commercial pilot for Apple and BT.
But the provision of computers is only half the story. Mr Craig Sears-Black,
the Apple manager in charge of the project, said: 'The merging of computers
and the communications business is at the centre of all this, integrating
telecoms with our products. We see our application of this (in Kington) as a
testbed.'
The project is based on four schemes. A communications telecentre will act
as the technological and social focus for the project. A computerised stock
control system based on three sports shops will act as a model of
cost-saving and enhanced efficiency for retailers. Local primary schools
will seek to computerise some of their administration, again in a bid to cut
costs and ensure survival. A further plan is to computerise tourist
information so that, for example, it will be available to visitors 24 hours
a day at the touch of a button.
Other schemes are being discussed. The local historical society wants to
computerise its card index. There is the suggestion of offering a
computerised marketing service for professional language translators.
Two broad issues are at play. First is the search by Apple and BT for new
markets. Second is the extent to which computers and telecommunications
might strengthen economic diversification in rural communities where farm
incomes are falling.
Apple Computer has been alert to the commercial possibilities in rural
communities since it made computers available to the community of
Jacksonville, Oregon in 1990 and monitored their impact on local business.
It says those results were promising.
But the Kington experiment is more elaborate. The local residents are
deciding what they want to do with the computers and Apple is providing
staff on the ground to tell the residents how to do it.
Kington is convenient for experimentation. 'We needed quite a controlled and
self-contained environment,' Mr Sears-Black said. The town's population is
2,200, or 4,500 if five nearby villages are included.
But the figures suggest this is a town where vigour is slowly ebbing.
Analysis of the 1991 census by CACI Information Services shows that in the
1980s there was a 25 per cent fall in residents aged between 15 and 19, and
that the town has 51 per cent more retired people than the British average.
Of the working population, 45 per cent are either self-employed or
part-time. Although officially the level of unemployment is low, residents
point to considerable under-employment as the rural economy, here as
elsewhere, weakens.
Certainly the community is not an electronic crusader. Although larger
companies in the area have used computers for years, there is a degree of
caution among individuals and in the small business sector.
Mr Miles Swinburne, the project's community manager, accepts this as
natural. 'The reason why business is strong is that they move with the times
but they don't jump on the bandwagon,' he suggested.
One factor behind the slow take-up of computers in the past, he added, 'is
that technical assistance is at least half an hour away.
Mr Terry James, a Kington farmer and district councillor, said: 'Another
reason for reluctance is that the advice people have had is prejudicial -
the advice has usually come from someone trying to sell a specific item.'
With the project there is the chance to overcome the prejudice, quieten the
techno-fear and try out ideas at no cost.
Mr Keith Harris, the computer specialist Apple has put into the town to make
the project work, said: 'The great thing for Kington is that they've got me
for nothing.'
But there cannot be a technological holiday for long. The kit comes free but
not the running costs. 'Our primary concern is that the initial projects
should start to make some money fairly quickly,' Mr Harris warned.
Apple and BT are there for a year, and the Rural Development Commission and
the district council for three. After that Kington will be on its own again.

OVERSEAS orders won by British construction companies rose by 29 per cent
last year to Pounds 2.9bn, figures published yesterday by the Department of

The increase was due mainly to additional work in North America and Hong

Mr John Gummer, environment secretary, said the rise in orders from the Far
East, one of the world's growth regions for construction, was particularly
encouraging.

FT  13 JUL 93 / Insurance company alters flexitime
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CLERICAL MEDICAL, the insurer, has abandoned its system of flexitime,
reports the latest bulletin from Industrial Relations Services, the
independent pay analysts, David Goodhart writes.
Flexitime allows employees to decide their own hours of work around a core
time specified by the company. Clerical and Medical said it had moved to a
system of paying people to do a job rather than to sit at a desk for a fixed
number of hours. This new culture clashed with the notion of 'counting hours
and minutes' inherent in pure flexitime systems.
It has run a flexitime system since 1975 for 1,200 of its 1,600 staff, but
said it had had to change as a result of growing competitive pressures.
The bulletin also reports on a study of the use of fixed-term contracts,
based on a survey of 123 organisations. This found that on average only 2.5
per cent of staff were employed on such contracts.
Nearly two-thirds of the survey respondents said they did not use them and
their use is concentrated in the public sector - eight out of 10
public-sector employers said they used them.
The most common group covered by fixed-term contracts was found to be
'professionals' followed by clerical workers. There was also evidence of an
extension of their use to managerial occupations.
The main reason employers gave for the use of fixed-term contracts was to
provide cover for short-term projects. More than half the organisations
surveyed give employees the same terms and conditions as permanent
employees.

FT  13 JUL 93 / Pay rises well above inflation reported
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART and IAN HAMILTON FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOME EMPLOYERS are continuing to offer pay rises more than three times the
1.3 per cent rate of inflation according to the latest pay bulletin from
Incomes Data Services.
The most dramatic increase in recent weeks was at the Halifax Building
Society where performance rises ranged between zero and 8.25 per cent for
18,000 staff.
The society said a 'tiny minority' of staff would receive 8.25 per cent. An
average performer at mid-point in the salary range would receive a 3 per
cent rise, compared with 5.5 per cent last year.
Other substantial rises include: 5.5 per cent for 430 workers at Pilkington
Insulation's fibreglass works in St Helens, Merseyside, after a 12 month
freeze; an increase of 5.5 per cent at electronics company National
Semiconductor in Greenock, Strathclyde; and a 4 per cent rise after a pay
freeze at Manchester bus company GM Buses.
According to the Engineering Employers' Federation, however, engineering
industry pay settlements are continuing to fall to an average of 2.09 per
cent in the three months from April to June.
Meanwhile the Yorkshire and Humberside regional council of the Trades Union
Congress said yesterday that low pay settlements were slowing recovery and
reducing living standards.
Mr Paul Jagger, TUC regional secretary, told a meeting with members of the
Confederation of British Industry in Leeds: 'A successful economy must be
based on equal sharing of the benefits of growth. Any attempt at creating
growth on the back of low wages is doomed to failure in the long run.'
Yorkshire and Humberside region has reported a series of low pay settlements
in the private sector this year, particularly among engineering employers in
South Yorkshire, where most recent awards have been under 2 per cent, and
one in five workforces have accepted pay freezes.
In March about 20,000 people employed by Sheffield City Council voted for a
3.25 per cent pay cut to avert 1,400 redundancies and balance the city's
budget.
Mr Jagger said: 'The general view that low wages equal a successful economy
is a policy we reject, as it simply produces not only low pay but also
low-skilled jobs in the longer run.'
The TUC is also worried that training is suffering. Mr Jagger called on the
government to stimulate recovery with tax incentives, particularly to
encourage training.
British Nuclear Fuels is offering staff up to four years' pay to leave the
company by June next year, according to the latest issue of the magazine
Personnel Today. BNFL hopes to tempt large numbers of its 8,000 white-collar
workers.

FT  13 JUL 93 / Treasury unit to boost private investment drive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN and JOHN WILLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TREASURY has formed a special unit to stimulate progress on the
government's initiative to involve private-sector capital in public-sector
projects.
With scores of such proposed projects stuck at various stages in the
approval process, there is mounting scepticism in the private sector and
some spending departments about the level of the Treasury's commitment.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, is understood to be enthusiastic about
the initiative, although the need for him to master his new brief may have
slowed its progress and frustrated those in spending ministries.
Eight months after last year's Autumn Statement, when sweeping changes to
the rules governing the use of private finance for public expenditure were
announced, the government has yet to unveil a single significant new project
which takes advantage of the changes.
This has led to disenchantment among industrialists and financiers. Mr
Howard Davies, director-general of the Confederation of British Industry,
said: 'There is a danger that the whole government private finance
initiative will be discredited unless real holes can be dug in the ground
pretty soon.'
Ministers in a number of spending departments are similarly despondent, with
some questioning the Treasury's preparedness to relax its grip.
Some ministers accuse the Treasury of continuing to insist on unrealistic
conditions that prospective partners in the private sector could not accept.
Some major projects, such as the Pounds 2bn CrossRail scheme for an
east-west rail link across London, appear to have been delayed by the
decision to seek private capital for part of the cost.
Talks about involving private finance in building the Pounds 2.5bn Channel
tunnel rail link are also taking longer than expected, dashing hopes that
conclusions would be reached by early July.
The Treasury insists it is keen for the initiative to be successful. The
private finance unit has been created to monitor progress and make sure
inventive ideas are circulated around spending departments.
The chancellor is expected to make a speech about the initiative before the
autumn party conference season. Its proponents hope this will give the idea
fresh impetus.

FT  13 JUL 93 / Unease at review of Arts Council
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Arts Council yesterday gave a guarded response to a review of its
working practices by accountancy firm Price Waterhouse commissioned by the
National Heritage Department.
Price Waterhouse made three suggestions for savings, the first of which it
says would save Pounds 429,000 a year from a total Arts Council budget of
Pounds 225m. The second would save Pounds 829,000. A third, more radical
option, would save Pounds 2.2m but mean, in effect, the end of an
independent Arts Council.
Mr Peter Brooke, the national heritage secretary, has indicated that he
favours the second option, but the Arts Council said proper checks would
have shown that the option would save about Pounds 390,000 - not Pounds
829,000 as suggested by Price Waterhouse.
The council is also unhappy with calculations that its administration costs
are 10p in the pound. It estimates them at less than 5p.

FT  13 JUL 93 / Employee share scheme 'failed'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A GOVERNMENT scheme to boost share ownership among ordinary employees by
allowing executives to buy share options at a discount has failed to achieve
its objective, Incomes Data Services, the independent pay group, said
yesterday.
Almost all the companies examined which had taken advantage of the discount
for their executives had schemes for other groups of employees in place
before the discount became available, IDS found.
Under a measure in the 1991 Budget, executives became eligible from January
1 last year to buy shares at up to 15 per cent below the market price. Until
then, to qualify with the Inland Revenue, the price paid when the option was
exercised had to be no less than the market value of the shares when the
option was granted.
The new discounts were conditional on the setting up of company-wide
employee share schemes. IDS said: 'The introduction of this substantial tax
benefit was explicitly linked to a need to provide top executives with an
incentive to spread share ownership to the shopfloor.'
The research shows that only two of 28 companies that had issued discounted
executive share options needed to set up a new all-employee scheme - 26
already had share schemes covering all employees.
A total of 108 separate options had been issued by the 28 companies, 41 of
them by seven FT-SE 100 companies. The average value of the discounted
options was Pounds 17,930, calculated as the difference between the market
price on the day of grant and the option price.
IDS concludes that, while few companies have issued discounted executive
options, many more have amended the rules of their schemes to allow for
them, most of which already have all-employee share schemes.
'For this reason, the growing use of discounted options is unlikely to
further the government's stated aim of spreading share ownership to the
shopfloor.'

FT  13 JUL 93 / Threat of strike by post staff recedes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A STRIKE by postal workers in London over the closure of five sorting
offices and the loss of up to 6,000 jobs looks unlikely, following talks
between Royal Mail management and the Union of Communication Workers.
Royal Mail has agreed to seek volunteers for redundancy and transfers
between offices, and will cushion any loss of earnings for up to a year for
those transferring.
The deal has been agreed by union leaders but postal workers in London will
be balloted this week before the threat of a strike is finally withdrawn.
The union had warned of the 'devastating effect' there could have been on
postal deliveries in the capital without an agreement.
Mr Mike Hogan, union negotiator, said the deal was 'an entirely satisfactory
settlement which contains elements which the union has been seeking for some
time'. He added that it had always been the union's intention to reach
agreement without disruption of services.

FT  13 JUL 93 / World Trade News: Bulgarian trade pact delayed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BULGARIA has been hit by the failure of the EC Council of Ministers to
approve the interim trade agreement signed on March 8 as part of Bulgaria's
proposed Association Agreement with the EC, Anthony Robinson writes.
Bulgaria has already suffered most from the EC and UN sanctions on Serbia
and the closure of trade routes through that country. The EC's failure also
puts in jeopardy its trade agreement with European Free Trade Association
countries, whose timetable depends on completing all stages of EC internal
Association Agreement procedures.
Bulgarian officials believe the delay stems from stonewalling by Italian
officials seeking to strengthen the safeguard clauses protecting EC members
from cheap eastern Europe imports generally.
The Sofia government has just survived an opposition attempt to force a
dissolution of parliament and early elections, and hopes the Council of
Ministers will finally approve the trade agreement at its next session in
Brussels on July 19.

FT  13 JUL 93 / World Trade News: Brittan seeks bigger world trade accord -
Tokyo deal on tariff cuts just 'down payment'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS and NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GENEVA, WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE four-way tariff-cutting deal struck at the Tokyo summit last week was
merely a 'down payment' on a much larger prospective trade liberalisation
accord, Sir Leon Brittan, EC trade commissioner, said yesterday.
Sir Leon, in Geneva to brief trading partners on the outcome of the summit,
told a news conference the European Community and the other Quad countries -
the US, Japan and Canada - were prepared to go further if other nations in
the Uruguay Round of global trade talks responded with new market access
concessions of their own.
'We have more to offer if others have more to offer,' he said, singling out
as EC targets bigger cuts in US textiles tariffs and better access to
financial services markets in east Asian economies.
The agreement by the Quad countries to eliminate tariffs in eight sectors,
cut other duties by up to 50 per cent and push for liberalisation of
financial and other services markets will form the basis for intensive
bilateral and multilateral negotiations on market-opening measures between
Uruguay Round participants over the next three to four weeks.
These talks will be launched formally tomorrow morning when the top-level
Trade Negotiations Committee, chaired by Mr Peter Sutherland,
director-general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, meets to
agree a work programme to conclude the 116-nation talks by December 15.
Negotiations will restart in Geneva in September on the remaining
outstanding issues in the round.
These include disagreements over anti-dumping and subsidies rules, dispute
settlement and the creation of a Multilateral Trade Organisation.
Sir Leon said yesterday the draft rules package should be subject to limited
changes only, and reaffirmed EC backing for an MTO which would curb use of
unilateral trade measures to solve disputes.
Yesterday evening, Sir Leon was due to host a dinner for members of Eurofer,
the European steelmakers' association, and his fellow commissioners, Mr
Karel Van Miert and Mr Martin Bangemann.
EC officials said the object was an 'exchange of views' on the planned
restructuring of the European steel industry, competition from eastern
European steel producers, and the stalemate in negotiations on a
Multilateral Steel Agreement.
Nancy Dunne in Washington adds: Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade
representative, said yesterday he would meet Mr Sutherland in Washington
next Monday as part of the drive to 'multilaterise' the tariff cut deals
reached by the industrialised countries in Tokyo.
Last week's agreement had created an atmosphere of confidence among the
negotiators of leading industrialised countries, he said, but there would
still be tough negotiations ahead. There are agreements in 18 products areas
and these 'may or may not change' depending on the offers of the other Gatt
members.
For example, the US may not be willing to cut its textile tariffs further
than agreed. Not only has it moved back from a proposal for 50 per cent cuts
on all tariffs above 15 per cent, but it also is insisting on taking 10
years for the tariff cuts, rather than the earlier proposal for six years.
US movement on both textile tariffs and quotas will depend on the
willingness of the large developing countries to open their markets to US
textiles.
Meanwhile, the US and Japan have cleared the way for intensive Gatt
negotiations by agreeing to delay negotiations on bilateral trade pacts for
at least six months. Under their new trade 'framework' they are to negotiate
market access arrangements on government procurement, the insurance market,
automotive industries and other high priority sectors, by the time the heads
of government first meet in 1994 or within the next six months.

FT  13 JUL 93 / Break in the US rains: Worst may be over as some floodwaters
start to recede
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRIGHT sunshine and a break in the rains yesterday gave some hope that the
worst might be over for the drenched farmers and townspeople of the Upper
Mississippi basin.
Although weather forecasters continued to warn that the chance of renewed
rain had not gone away, some tributary rivers seemed to have stabilised and
floodwaters began to recede in a few areas of the six-state region
devastated by weeks of flooding.
The federal government was also looking on the bright side. As
Vice-President Al Gore flew to St Louis to inspect the flood damage, Mr
Robert Reich, the labour secretary, suggested that the flooding might
actually improve the employment outlook in the short term.
'You're going to have so many state dollars and federal dollars, so much
rebuilding of the area, that a lot of people are going to have to be put to
work to rebuild,' Mr Reich said.
Mr Gore's visit yesterday appeared designed to head off criticism of the
administration for not taking a close enough interest in the disaster areas.
Although President Bill Clinton visited the region a week ago on his way to
the Tokyo summit, his stopover for a holiday in Hawaii on the way back had
given ammunition to those who wished to attack him.
However, the river began battering an area south of St Louis after
floodwaters forced thousands of people to flee the Des Moines, Iowa, area,
where the Des Moines and Raccoon rivers merge in the Mississippi watershed.
Officials said that about 7,000 residents had been evacuated from their
homes and an estimated 300,000 people left without drinking water and an
estimated 35,000 without electricity.
Federal officials have declined to give an overall estimate of the cost of
the flood damage, but federal disaster relief has been promised, and an
emergency spending bill is expected to be required to provide the money.
Even if the rains stop, it may take some time for flooding to subside,
because many up- stream dams, built to provide flood containment capacity,
are overflowing and will have to continue to release water.
At the same time, earth and sand levees built along the riverbanks remain
saturated and could continue to give way long after the floodwaters have
crested.
Meanwhile the heatwave that has baked areas of the US east coast eased
yesterday.
A storm that caused showers in the northern Rockies early yesterday was
moving east, bringing hope that it would break the heat in the east by
midweek.
A second front, pushing down from Canada and the Great Lakes, is also
expected to bring cooler weather.
Philadelphia saw one of the worst death tolls from the hot spell, with 24
people declared dead of heat-related causes, raising the city's death toll
to 41 by Sunday, according to Dr Robert K. Ross, the city's health
commissioner.

FT  13 JUL 93 / Markets unfazed by crop losses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA BRANTSEN and LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CROP losses from the high rainfall and flooding in the US Midwest have so
far been around Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.3bn), according to estimates from Iowa
State University, with nearly half the losses in flooded Iowa farm country.
Some counties in Iowa have had three times the normal amount of rainfall
this month, deluging the richest corn-growing area in the US.
Nearly 4m acres of prime midwestern farmland have either been too wet to
plant spring crops or flooded by the swollen rivers.
While that may mean disaster for many individual farmers, the impact on
world cereal prices is expected to be very small. 'This is not a significant
event,' said Mr Dennis Starleaf, head of the economics department at Iowa
State University. 'It is way too early to tell if we won't actually get a
boost in yields because of the excess moisture.'
There is an old market axiom that 'rain makes grain'. Although farm country
on either side of the Mississippi river is under water, and floods are
occurring in other parts of Iowa and Missouri, crops in the eastern US corn
belt, in the states of Ohio, Indiana, and eastern Illinois, are in excellent
condition.
Also, farmers still have over 2bn bushels of maize in store from last year's
crop. The feedgrain supply is more than adequate, with few prospects for
long-term food price inflation, Mr Starleaf said.
At the Chicago Board of Trade yesterday, traders sent soyabean prices
sharply lower as flood-related panic buying ebbed. Prices for harvest-time
delivery are up over 20 per cent since mid-June, to more than Dollars 7 a
bushel.
However, yesterday's setback was predictable after such a big rise. Crop
analysts now fear that if high prices are sustained through the summer, it
will encourage Brazilian farmers to plant record acreage with soyabeans.
A loss of 4m acres to the floods is small when compared to the 56m that were
planted with maize and soyabeans in the US last year, when record yields
resulted in a bumper 240.8m metric tonne maize crop and a respectable 60m
tonne soyabean harvest.
Soyabean prices will increase sharply and US exports will fall because of
the midwestern flooding, according to a US Department of Agriculture
economist, Dr Scott Sanford.
Weekly crop projections published yesterday show the price of soyabeans will
increase an average of 50c a bushel.
Damage to soyabean crops comes on the heels of several years of bumper
crops. 'We've been in a spate of record crops because production has been
moving out of lower yielding areas such as the south-east and delta and into
the corn belt,' said Dr Sanford.
The price increase, he said, would make US exports less competitive on the
world market. The higher prices might also hit livestock prices. The USDA
reduced projected yields from 2.04bn bushels to 1.97bn.
Projected maize yields were also reduced, by 650m bushels to 7.85bn bushels,
by the flooding. Price rises are expected to be low, however, because of
large stocks of corn - up an average 15c a bushel to Dollars 2.20.

FT  13 JUL 93 / Washington to foot the bill: Number of claims will rise as
the waters fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOST OF the insurance cost resulting from the Mississippi floods will be
picked up by the federal government, under the National Flood Insurance
Programme and a separate federally-run crop insurance scheme.
The Federal Insurance Administration, which runs the National Flood
Insurance Programme, said yesterday it could not yet put a figure on the
cost of the disaster in insurance terms.
By Friday, it had received 41 claims in Illinois, where it has around 3,600
policyholders, about 29 claims in Missouri, where there are more than 7,300
policyholders, and smaller numbers of claims from Wisconsin, Iowa and
Minnesota.
However, these numbers are expected to increase once the waters have receded
and the extent of the damage becomes clearer.
The National Flood Insurance Programme, which began life about 25 years ago,
is administered by private sector insurers, who pay out claims and are then
reimbursed by the federal authorities. Over the past eight years, the
programme has been self-funding, according to the American Insurance
Association - with premiums collected from policyholders meeting the claims
submitted.
Both the Federal Insurance Administration and the AIA acknowledge that there
may be substantial under-insurance - or non-insurance - in flood-affected
areas.
The AIA estimates that there are about 10m buildings in the nation's flood
plains, and that only about 2.5m are covered by federal insurance.
There is virtually no private-sector flood insurance written, although some
supplementary coverage is sometimes purchased to top up the federal scheme.
As a result, a number of the largest US property-casualty insurers, who
suffered multi-billion-dollar losses from Hurricane Andrew in August last
year and Hurricane Hugo in 1989, said the Mississippi situation should cause
them little problem.
'Much of the flooding situation is covered by federal government, and we're
a relatively small player on the commercial side,' said Allstate, the large
Chicago-based property-casualty insurer.

FT  13 JUL 93 / Action plan for World Bank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE World Bank has increased its budget for supervision activities by 12 per
cent for the current year as part of its efforts to improve the
effectiveness of its lending.
Mr Ernest Stern, a World Bank managing director and acting president while
Mr Lewis Preston, the president, is recovering from surgery, said yesterday
the new action plan agreed at a board meeting last week would accelerate a
cultural change within the bank and should help to improve the management of
the 1,850 projects in its portfolio.
'Central to the plan is the commitment to make the management of projects
under implementation as important as making new loans. Only sound,
on-the-ground results - the development impact of projects - are true
measures of the bank's contribution to sustainable development,' Mr Stern
said.
The new action plan comes in response to last year's report by a taskforce
which identified a sharp decline in the quality of the bank's portfolio,
with particular problems in Africa and in the agricultural sector.
At the heart of the plan is a determination to manage the bank's portfolio
of projects within each country as a unit, instead of project by project.
Mr Stern said country reviews would in future be conducted annually for big
borrower countries, and on a regular basis for smaller borrowers.
Over half of the bank's biggest country portfolios, however, have already
undergone review, and as a result a number of projects have been cancelled
or redesigned.
In India, a review led to the cancellation of projects totalling Dollars
1.3bn (Pounds 866m).
Mr Stern insisted, however, that the basic responsibility for ensuring that
projects were properly implemented lay with the borrower, not the bank.

TAIPEI's plans to buy 210 advanced fighters from the US and France came a
step closer yesterday when a joint legislative committee approved NTDollars
318.7bn (Dollars 11.4bn) in funds for the purchases, reports Dennis Engbarth
from Taipei.
Formal approval by parliament to purchase 150 F-16 Falcons from the US and
60 Mirage 2000 fighters from Franceis expected later this week, even though
the lack of clear provisions for technology transfers to Taiwan will attract
widespread criticism from lawmakers in both the ruling Kuomintang and the
opposition Democratic Progressive party.
Mr Sun Chen, minister of national defence, said the 210 advanced aircraft
would join 130 IDF (indigenous developed fighters) now in production and 90
remaining F-5E fighters in the island's revamped air defence force.
The 430 jet fighters are expected to meet all Taiwan's air defence needs
until the year 2000 without more purchases from foreign suppliers, Mr Sun
said.

FT  13 JUL 93 / World Trade News: Tough talking taints EC-Russian
'partnership' accord - Trade across Europe / Moscow's interpretation of Gatt
rulebook is central to the trade negotiations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR Leon Brittan, the EC's chief trade negotiator, will not forget his trip
to Moscow last month in a hurry. During tense bargaining, Sir Leon professed
astonishment that his Russian hosts were proving so obstinate.
After all, the Community had made similar proposals to Guatemala regarding
the new EC banana regime, without a murmur of protest.
'Russia,' thundered Mr Boris Yeltsin, president of the Russian federation,
'is not Guatemala.'
EC officials stress that Sir Leon had no intention of suggesting that Russia
had become a banana republic; but last month's exchange with Mr Yeltsin
confirms that the EC's effort to forge a new trade and political agreement
with Russia has run into difficulty.
The EC's offer of a 'partnership agreement' goes back to 1989 when the
Twelve wanted to encourage economic and political reform in the former
Soviet Union. Today, the idea is to strengthen democracy in Russia with the
main incentive being the 'long-term goal' of a free trade area with the
Community.
In Russian eyes, the EC is a more important trading partner than the US or
Japan. Last year, Russia accounted for an estimated 70 per cent of the
former Soviet Union's Dollars 4.8bn trade surplus with the Community.
Yet despite the steady two-way trade flow, the EC remains unsure of how to
deal with Russia's transition to a market economy and how to fit a new
approach into a comprehensive policy toward the former Soviet Union, where
central authority in Moscow is declining and new republics are clamouring
for attention.
The central difficulty in the EC-Russia talks stems from Russian demands for
the same treatment which the Community gives members of the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
In concrete terms, Mr Yeltsin wants free movement of goods, services,
capital (with some reservations), and persons. But the EC says 'Gatt
treatment' is out of the question until it establishes a market economy.
As Sir Leon explained, Russia still has a long way to go. Its domestic
energy prices are artificially low because of state subsidies; Russian
enterprises still do not know what their costs are; and Russia's recent
application to join Gatt, while welcomed in Brussels, will take a long time
to process.
The result is that the EC is insisting on a special 'safeguard' clause which
would apply until Russia fully complies with Gatt rules. This would allow
Brussels wide discretion to block imports it considered to fall in the
category of 'dumping', particularly in sensitive sectors such as aluminium,
steel and textiles.
The Russians argue that this clause is much harsher than the retaliation
allowed under Gatt rules - and likely to deter foreign investment in
potential hard-currency earning export industries.
In short, Mr Yeltsin feels the EC is treating Russia as a 'state trading'
country such as China and North Korea, without recognition of its democratic
reforms. As Brussels has discovered, the Russians have not been shy about
saying 'Nyet', nor has the fall of communism blunted their negotiating
skills.
The debate over 'Gatt treatment' touches on Russian pride; but a good deal
of self-interest is also at stake. EC officials say Russia is pressing for
greater market access for its exports of low-price uranium and it wants
provisions for greater freedom of movement of people so that businessmen do
not have to waste time on visa applications.
In the field of human rights, the Community remains hopeful it can obtain
satisfactory guarantees on human rights before signing a partnership
agreement. But an early suggestion for a 'suspension' clause under which the
pact might be put on ice in the event of human rights abuses, has apparently
been dropped after Russian objections.
Earlier this year, when Mr Yeltsin appeared to be in danger of losing a
popular referendum, the EC sent a delegation to Moscow offering, for the
first time, the prospect of a free trade area. 'They just pocketed a major
concession,' says an EC official.
Nor has the EC always presented a united front. Two months ago, the Queen of
Denmark issued an invitation to Mr Yeltsin to come to Copenhagen, ostensibly
to celebrate 500 years of friendship between the Baltic near-neighbours.
The Danish Presidency of the EC described it as a 'Danish initiative'; but
EC officials believe the timing of the invitation was a less-than-subtle
effort to accelerate the pace of negotiations and secure a deal for the June
21-22 summit. In the event, Mr Yeltsin did not turn up. With hindsight, some
EC officials believe Sir Leon's tough stance in Moscow was intended to sink
any chance of Mr Yeltsin 'hijacking' the summit.
The challenge in the next few months will be to put the negotiations back on
track and resolve the conundrum on Gatt treatment. One option is to insert
an 'evolutionary' clause holding out the prospect of free trade if the
Russia successfully follows Gatt discipline.
In this respect, Sir Leon's encounter may have helped both sides by removing
false expectations about the size and scope of a future bilateral trade
agreement.

FT  13 JUL 93 / Action plan for World Bank: Moves to improve project
supervision
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE World Bank has increased its budget for supervision activities by 12 per
cent for the current year as part of its efforts to improve the
effectiveness of its lending.
Mr Ernest Stern, a World Bank managing director and acting president while
Mr Lewis Preston, the president, is recovering from surgery, said yesterday
that the new action plan agreed at a board meeting last week would
accelerate a cultural change within the bank and should help to improve the
management of the 1,850 projects in its portfolio.
'Central to the plan is the commitment to make the management of projects
under implementation as important as making new loans. Only sound,
on-the-ground results - the development impact of projects - are true
measures of the bank's contribution to sustainable development,' Mr Stern
said.
The new action plan comes in response to last year's report by a taskforce
headed by Mr Willi Wapenhans, a World Bank veteran, which identified a sharp
decline in the quality of the bank's portfolio, with particular problems in
Africa and in the agricultural sector.
At the heart of the plan is a new determination to manage the bank's entire
portfolio of projects within each country as a unit, instead of project by
project.
Mr Stern said country reviews would in future be conducted annually for big
borrower countries, and on a regular basis for smaller borrowers.
Over half of the bank's biggest country portfolios, however, have already
undergone review, and as a result a number of projects have been cancelled
or redesigned.
In India, a review led to the cancellation of projects totalling Dollars
1.3bn (Pounds 866m), while a similar review in Brazil brought the
cancellation of five big projects worth Dollars 800m, substantial redesign
of 14 more projects, mostly in the agricultural sector, and lesser changes
to 14 others.
Mr Stern insisted, however, that the fundamental responsibility for ensuring
that projects were properly implemented lay with the borrower, not the bank.
'The bank's efforts to improve the development impact of its work,
ultimately, can only be as successful as the efforts taken by our borrowers
to help themselves,' Mr Stern said.
The action plan also sets out new criteria for climbing up the World Bank
career ladder, with staff winning promotion less for their ability to push
through new loans and more for their ability to follow through on existing
projects.

MR Stanley Ho, Macao's casino tycoon, has unveiled a Dollars 1.4bn (Pounds
930m) plan to develop the Portuguese colony's central business district
which will increase the size of Macao city by 20 per cent, reports Simon
Holberton from Macao.
The three-stage Nam Van Lakes development will cover an area of 130 hectares
and provide 46 development sites for offices, housing and hotels, as well as
two fresh water lakes. It is due to be completed by 1999, the year in which
Macao reverts to Chinese sovereignty.
Work on the project's first stage, worth Patacas 3bn (Pounds 248m), is due
to be completed in 1995 and will provide fully serviced reclaimed land
suitable for eight office towers, three residential developments and a
luxury hotel.
The project is owned by Nam Van Development, 60 per cent controlled by
mainland Chinese interests. Mr Ho's Sociedade de Turismo e Diversoes de
Macau (STDM) owns 25 per cent of the company, which is capitalised at
Patacas 800m.

FT  13 JUL 93 / UN arms expert heads for Baghdad
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR ROLF EKEUS, head of the United Nations special commission into Iraq's
weapons of mass destruction, said he would leave today for Baghdad in a
further attempt to resolve peacefully the latest stand-off between Iraqi
officials and UN weapons inspectors.
Mr Ekeus made the announcement in New York last night after briefing the UN
Security Council. The impasse follows the departure from Iraq on Sunday of a
UN weapons inspection team after it failed to win Iraq's agreement to seal
monitoring equipment at two missile testing sites.
Mr Ekeus, who said he wanted to talk to Iraqi officials at the 'highest
level',has visited Iraq before to defuse similar stand-offs. He expects to
arrive in Baghdad on Thursday.
One UN diplomat said a trip this week would enable the Security Council 'not
to act precipitately, but show that it was serious' about forcing Iraqi
compliance with Gulf war ceasefire resolutions.
Iraqi newspapers yesterday suggested Mr Ekeus would find little warmth in
Baghdad. The official al-Jumhuriya decried attempts to monitor the test
sites as 'evidence of the wicked and malicious intentions of Ekeus and the
criminal designs of those standing behind him'.
The Security Council has already warned in a June 18 statement of 'serious
consequences' should Iraq continue to resist UN attempts to monitor the
sites at al-Rafah and Yam al-Azim, respectively 70km west and south-west of
Baghdad. An earlier UN team failed to persuade Iraqi authorities to install
video monitors to prevent testing of missiles with a range of more than
150km, prohibited under ceasefire resolutions.
Diplomats in New York consider that no further warning to Iraq or UN
resolution would formally be required before a strike on the two sites, but
last night they were playing down any prospect of immediate action.
China, one of the five permanent members of the Security Council, yesterday
distanced itself from talk of a strike, with Foreign Ministry officials in
Beijing saying the confrontation should be resolved 'through consultation
and dialogue'. Some officials in New York said they were inclined to apply
more pressure, but wait and see if Iraq would back down.
Nevertheless, an attack remains a clear option, one which was raised
immediately by Mr Al Gore, the US vice-president, who warned Iraq not to
'trifle' with the world community.
The two sites are understood to be in industrial zones where there would be
far less risk of 'collateral' damage and civilian casualties than in last
month's US cruise missile raid on Iraqi intelligence headquarters in central
Baghdad.
Each site comprises a small cluster of buildings, with a test stand at each
to allow the monitored firing of missile engines - with liquid fuel at
al-Rafah and solid fuel at Yam al-Azim. The housing for these stands would
offer a natural target in any raid. It was at these that UN teams sought to
install cameras and later to seal and lock monitoring sensors.

A POWERFUL earthquake in northern Japan, measured at 7.8 on the Richter
scale, wrecked a small hotel, set hundreds of houses on fire and swept
dozens more away with tidal waves last night, agencies report from Tokyo.
Police said that 18 people had been killed and 60 injured, while more than
40 were missing. The casualty figures were expected to rise.
The quake was followed by several aftershocks in the same area, off the west
coast of the northern island of Hokkaido.
Among the casualties at least five people were reported killed and about 20
said to be missing after the hotel collapsed on Okushiri Island.
NHK television and Kyodo News Service said about 300 houses were burning on
another part of the island of 4,600 people, about 50km south of the quake's
centre. A number of houses also were washed away by tidal waves. Three
hundred troops of Japan's self-defence forces helped rescue efforts on the
island.

FT  13 JUL 93 / PLO chief backtracks on claim of 'secret talks'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
PLO CHAIRMAN Yassir Arafat last night backtracked on an earlier claim that
Israeli and PLO officials held secret and direct discussions on two
occasions during last month's Middle East peace talks in Washington.
The conflicting signals from the PLO leader, however, are unlikely to end
speculation that direct contacts have been taking place between the PLO and
Israeli officials or politicians.
Mr Arafat set off a flurry of speculation and denials when he told Reuters
news agency in Tunis: 'There were two meetings last month in Washington'
aimed at breaking the deadlock in the Middle East peace talks, but they were
'unsuccessful'.
But hours later, Mr Arafat told the news agency that what he meant was that
'there were Palestinian attempts to meet the Israelis in Washington but that
these attempts failed and the meetings did not took place'.
His backtracking came after the offices of Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the Israeli
prime minister, and of Mr Shimon Peres, the foreign minister, denied there
had been government-backed contacts.
Mr Arafat's earlier claim prompted an apparent confirmation from Mr Nabil
Shaath, a political adviser to the PLO leader. He asserted in Cairo that
such contacts had taken place, but refused to say who had participated or
when. 'These contacts exist, existed and should become the norm of
negotiations,' he said.
The later backtracking suggested that the PLO may have had second thoughts
about the wisdom of pursuing this line publicly.
Direct dialogue with the PLO was expressly proscribed by Israel in its
conditions for entering the peace process, on the grounds that it is a
terrorist organisation dedicated to the destruction of the Jewish state.
But the Israeli parliament in January repealed the law banning contacts
between individual Israelis and PLO members. It is clear a growing number of
top Israeli politicians favour abandoning the taboo.
Last week a Labour MP named 11 members of Mr Rabin's 18-strong cabinet who
he said were in favour of opening direct talks with the PLO to break the
deadlock in the peace talks. It is widely believed that Mr Haim Ramon, the
health minister and a moderate, telephoned Mr Arafat last week.
Israel Radio also said yesterday that Egyptian foreign ministry officials
had said Israel had agreed in principle to change the terms of the Madrid
conference which specifically excludes the PLO from peace talks.
Mr Dan Cohen, a Labour MP, said the PLO had told him that the contacts with
the Israeli government were being undertaken through members of the Labour
party. The MPs, he said, were acting in the grey area between official and
unofficial contacts.
He said the talks focused on the 'Gaza first' option - a proposal to hand
over the occupied Gaza strip to an autonomous Palestinian authority as soon
as possible and before any transfer of authority in the occupied West Bank.
The discussions also included human rights in the occupied territories and
how to reach an agreement on a joint statement of principles setting out the
modalities for Palestinian interim self-rule.
He added that Israeli denials that such meetings had taken place showed that
Israeli was 'not yet willing to come up with the reality that there is no
way round negotiations directly with the PLO'.
Present negotiations between the Israelis and the Palestinian delegation to
the talks remain stalled after their tenth and latest round in Washington.

FT  13 JUL 93 / State banks feel the pinch in Indonesia: Concern over
quality of loans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM KEELING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Indonesian government is preparing for battle with its recalcitrant
state banks amid growing concern about their loans.
A study by the World Bank, giving an economic overview to an aid donors'
conference in Paris at the end of June, said in a section on the banking
system that 'loan portfolio quality has deteriorated sharply since 1990. . .
maintaining stability in the banking system is now the chief objective of
financial policy'.
This was followed by a leaked local report on the finances of the state
banks, which accounted for over half the banking sector's total assets of
Rp123,689bn (Pounds 39.7bn) at the end of 1992.
Details of the report began to appear in the Indonesian press last month.
Government officials deny it was drawn up by the central bank and will not
confirm its authenticity, but say it could be the work of 'monetary
authorities'.
The report estimates that last December 32 per cent of state banks' loan
portfolio of Rp71,701bn were non-performing - usually defined as having no
interest paid for more than three months. It also says that Rp21,000bn in
loans were made by six state banks to just 35 companies, of which 26 were in
payment arrears on loans totalling Rp6,927bn.
The state banks are renowned for having suffered years of incompetent and
corrupt management. The problem they present to the government, however, is
more than just bad banking practice. Many of the 26 companies allegedly in
arrears are newly emerging, politically well-connected conglomerates,
including three led by relatives of President Suharto.
In its study, the World Bank criticises such conglomerates, pointing out
their formation 'may not be to take advantage of competitive opportunities'.
It suggests they are seeking excess profits from monopolies granted by the
government.
It says: 'The growth of conglomerates during the 1980s appears to have been
much faster than could be sustained from retained earnings. . . the
implication is that debt-financing has been a major source of growth.'
The apparent result is an array of conglomerates - whose interests range
from financial services to agri-business and petrochemicals - built upon
state bank loans which, despite the borrowers' often monopolistic positions,
have turned sour.
Many bankers believe the conglomerates can afford to service the loans but
they doubt the government has sufficient leverage to enforce repayment. As
one business executive explains, 'many of the conglomerates see themselves
as shareholders in President Suharto's regime'.
Dr Sjahrir, managing director of the Institute for Economic and Financial
Research in Jakarta, says: 'The only path by which you can control their
power is through a more efficient market system, so that you have more
competitive pressure for each conglomerate.'
Bankers say, however, that the government is responding to the crisis.
The government might intervene by forcing conglomerates to sell shares to
state pension funds. The finance raised could pay off the conglomerates' bad
debt and give the pension funds equity in some of Indonesia's largest
businesses.
The government has also taken up a suggestion in the World Bank study that
'lower interest rates would both improve financial soundness and spur credit
growth'. Bank Indonesia has cut by one-third to an average 8.5 per cent the
key interest on government bonds since the beginning of May and state banks
have lowered deposit and lending rates.
A sudden increase in credit, however, could result in a surge in imports,
deteriorating balance of payments and inflationary pressures.
Economists also warn that new credit provided by banks could itself become
non-performing. They point out that many private banks - also burdened by
non-performing loans - are owned by the same conglomerates indebted to the
state banks and which have often used their banking subsidiaries to fund
intra-group activities.
A lowering of interest rates, therefore, is unlikely to pull the banking
system back into line. Instead, the long-term solution lies in withdrawing
the political patronage by which conglomerates have obtained state bank
credit and the confidence not to repay.
Whether the government has the stomach fully to engage the conglomerates
remains to be seen.

FT  13 JUL 93 / Nigerian president orders fresh poll
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ADAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NIGERIA faces another presidential election after an announcement late last
night that there could, after all, be no interim government to replace the
military regime on August 27.
This latest twist to President Ibrahim Babangida's six-year transition to
democracy follows his annulment of last month's presidential polls, which
were the first for a decade.
Although the polls were widely regarded as peaceful and fair, the military
government claimed that the elections were flawed and that the winning
candidate, Mr Moshood Abiola of the Social Democratic Party (SDP), was unfit
to hold office.
The statement read last night by Information Minister Uche Chukwumerije
leaves Nigeria's political future as unclear as at any stage in the lengthy
transition to democracy. The president decided to press ahead with new
elections on July 31 after the country's two political parties failed to
agree on his proposals to set up an interim government and to hand over
power to an unelected civilian president.
President Babangida issued his order after meeting a group of his generals
and leaders of the two parties. Mr Abiola's Social Democrats stormed out of
the meeting.
The SDP has already ruled out fresh elections under the military regime,
claiming that they would have no credibility and that its candidate's
victory on June 12 should be officially recognised. Mr Abiola has declared
himself president-elect and will oppose any movement within the SDP to take
part in fresh polls.
Mr Abiola is a member of the Yoruba tribe, and many Nigerians believe that
the country's generals, dominated by the Hausa, are implacably opposed to
allowing him to be sworn in as president.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   SEOUL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EFFORTS to resolve the North Korean nuclear issue will take several months
of 'painstaking negotiations,' Mr Han Sung-joo, the South Korean foreign
minister, said yesterday.
Mr Han cautioned that the process would be complicated because North Korea
must hold separate talks with the US, South Korea and the International
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) on allowing full nuclear inspections.
The US will start talks with North Korea tomorrow in Geneva to persuade
Pyongyang to stay within the nuclear non-proliferation treaty (NPT) and
accept IAEA inspections of two nuclear waste facilities that could determine
whether North Korea is processing more plutonium than it has declared.
The US has also indicated that progress should be achieved in implementing
mutual nuclear inspections between North and South Korea before it is
willing to expand relations with Pyongyang.
North Korea has recently adopted a conciliatory attitude towards the US in
preparation for the talks, including toning down its anti-US rhetoric and
yesterday returning the remains of 17 UN soldiers killed during the Korean
War.
Pyongyang is sending a 'signal to Washington that it is interested in
improving relations,' explained Mr Han.
In contrast, US President Bill Clinton during his weekend visit to South
Korea appeared to toughen his stance against the North Korean nuclear
programme. Earlier he had offered concessions including allowing high-level
meetings between US and North Korean officials after Pyongyang threatened in
March to withdraw from the NPT. The talks in New York eventually persuaded
North Korea to suspend its NPT withdrawal last month.
The tougher US approach has the full backing of Seoul, according to Mr Han.
'We recognised that North Korea may have felt insecure and we tried to take
measures to allay the unnecessary fears that North Korea may have had,' he
explained about the first round of US-North Korean negotiations.
The sharper tone now being adopted was meant to emphasise to North Korea
that the nuclear issue 'is a very serious matter and must be resolved'.
The foreign minister denied there were any differences between the US and
South Korea on how to deal with the North Korean issue, explaining that
Seoul did not favour a more conciliatory approach than Washington.
He was 'neither optimistic nor pessimistic about the outcome' of this week's
US-North Korean talks. However Pyongyang had no choice but to accept nuclear
inspections because it wanted to avoid UN economic sanctions. 'I have no
doubt that sanctions are something North Korea does not want to be faced
with,' Mr Han said, referring to the country's difficult economic situation.

FT  13 JUL 93 / Thai air force sees chance for power at airline

THE THAI air force has been given an unexpected opportunity to try to
reassert control over Thai International Airways, the country's flag carrier
following the sudden death last week of its chairman, Mr Pandit Bunyapana.
Thai's vice-chairman, Air Chief Marshal Gun Pimarntip, has clearly signalled
that the air force which he heads should decide who replaces Mr Pandit as
chairman. Air Chief Marshal Gun threatened to resign in February because the
air force was being given little say in running the company.
Thai International was an air force fiefdom until the military's fall from
grace last year following its unsuccessful but bloody attempt to maintain
control of the government.
Air Chief Marshal Kaset Rojananil, who had been chairman until then, was
replaced by Mr Pandit, permanent secretary at the Finance Ministry which is
the majority shareholder. Mr Pandit apparently died in his sleep of a heart
attack last Thursday while on a Thai International flight from London to
Bangkok.
Manoeuvring to replace Mr Pandit has been complicated by the retirement this
year of Air Chief Marshal Gun himself and the airline's respected president,
Mr Chatrachai Bunya-ananta.
Joining the faction-ridden management, the Finance Ministry and the air
force in the tussle for control of Thai has been an ambitious deputy
transport and communications minister, Mr Thawee Kraiupti, who has led a
crusade for the carrier to be brought under his ministry's jurisdiction.
One airline analyst in Bangkok said: 'It's a four-way fight for control
which - by the end of the decade - the management will have won because Thai
will never be competitive in the long run without independent professional
management. The question is how painful the process is going to be.'
A minority of the airline's shares was floated in July 1993. It has
struggled in recent years under the weight of previous management mistakes
and over-optimism. Profits for the latest half-year were Bt568.4m (Pounds
14.85m) compared with Bt1.31bn in 1992. Many brokers say full year profits
will be little more than Bt2bn - around a third of the company's original
forecasts.
Thai International's share price has risen 22 per cent over five days,
hitting its 10 per cent daily limit rise over each of the last two trading
sessions, to close at Bt49.75 yesterday.

FT  13 JUL 93 / Kurds fear Saddam's ire: Level of allied protection seems
unclear
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARETH SMYTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS TENSION between Iraq and the west rises again, fears that Baghdad will
attack the Kurds in retaliation for last month's western air strikes have
compounded the daily anxieties of the 3m people of the Kurdish enclave of
northern Iraq.
Left in limbo for two years, the enclave can do little to help itself,
either by attracting investment to rebuild its shattered infrastructure or
by tapping oil reserves.
President Saddam Hussein is a man of surprises. His strategy has been to
wait. Economic hardship will, he believes, compel the Kurdish leadership to
resume autonomy negotiations broken off in 1991.
The Kurds are in a weak position. Kurdish leaders have no clear idea what
allied protection they might get. 'We are getting confusing signals,' a
senior Kurdish official said.
All of Iraq is covered by United Nations Security Council resolution 688
which demands that Mr Saddam's regime ends internal repression. Specific
additional safeguards for the Kurds date from 1991, when 15,000 allied
troops entered northern Iraq to enforce the world's first 'safe haven.' This
uncertain departure in international procedures persuaded over 1m Kurds to
return.
The safe haven near the Turkish border which Iraqi troops were forbidden to
enter is now in effect defunct: only 18 allied soldiers - based in Zakho -
remain. The wider 'no-fly zone', Iraqi aircraft north of the 36th parallel,
is still in force.
But the political geography of northern Iraq is more complex still. The
Kurdish-held zone, from which Mr Saddam withdrew all administration in
October 1991, is divided from the rest of Iraq by an informal 'green line.'
While part of the no-fly zone is in government hands, a substantial part of
the Kurdish-held zone, including the city of Sulaymaniyah, is outside the
no-fly zone and so beyond any area of formal western commitment.
No-one doubts the ability of Iraqi forces to subdue the Kurds. A recent US
congressional report said Iraq had rebuilt 80 per cent of its military
manufacturing capacity and returned to service 2,500 tanks and 250 aircraft.
The Kurds do not expect support from allied ground troops.
'If the Iraqis launch a major offensive, the allies will intervene,' Mr
Hoshyar Zebari, a Kurdish spokesman, said in Washington earlier this month.
'But it would be from the air.'
Uncertainty over security hampers rebuilding of the Kurdish infrastructure.
The Kurdish-held zone, like the rest of Iraq, is subject to UN sanctions.
'Electricity, telecommunications, and roads are all in ruin,' Mr Latif
Rashid, another Kurdish representative, told aid workers in London recently.
'Local factories have ceased to function.'
Early reports say this year's harvest is good, but much will find its way to
Baghdad. 'The Iraqis have raised the price paid for the crops and farmers
are desperate to get money,' said Mr Zebari.
The Kurdish leadership seeks acceptance abroad, but recent regional
developments are unfavourable. Both Iran and Turkey, neighbouring countries
with 5m and 10m Kurds respectively, have denounced the Iraqi Kurds' plan for
a federal Iraq.
Relations between Iraqi Kurds and Iran deteriorated recently as Tehran
became increasingly concerned at Kurdish unrest within its own borders,
fostered, it believes, by Iraqi Kurdish TV stations.
Since March Iranian jets and artillery have bombed guerrilla bases operated
by the Kurdistan Democratic Party of Iran inside Iraq.
The ending in June by the Kurdish Workers Party (PKK) of its two-month
ceasefire with the Turkish army alarms Iraqi Kurds, whose most important
trade lifeline is threatened by resumption of hostilities in south-east
Turkey.
The alternative is re-opening autonomy talks with Baghdad.
Mr Mukarram Talabani, a former Iraqi government minister, operates as a
go-between and reportedly made a recent visit to the Kurdish leadership. But
the further their economic situation deteriorates, the weaker will be the
Kurds' negotiating position.

FARMERS yesterday tore down the administrative block of the Cargill Seeds
factory at Siravara in the southern Indian state of Karnataka to protest
against the US multinational's operations in India, which it said deprived
local farmers of their livelihood.
Police arrested 50 activists of the powerful Karnataka Farmers' Association
after they attacked the Cargill office building.
Mr M D Nanjundaswamy, member of the Karnataka legislative assembly and
president of the association, said similar attacks would be launched on
multinationals trying to patent seeds and plants that Indians had used for
centuries.
The farmers plan to step up their campaign to protect the interests of small
farmers who feel threatened by efforts to tighten patent laws in developing
countries as part of a move to conclude the Uruguay Round of the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. 'Our targets will include WR Grace and
Company of Florida, who have patented the Indian neem tree (used widely in
herbal medicine and cosmetics), and Pioneer Seeds of the US, who are trying
to deprive farmers of their livelihood,' said Mr Nanjundaswamy.
Cargill South East Asia, a subsidiary of Cargill Inc, is also facing the
wrath of salt farmers and environmentalists in the Kutch region in Gujarat
on India's west coast after the government cleared the allotment of 15,000
acres of land near the Kandla port there to set up a salt manufacturing
unit.
Indian police yesterday arrested nearly 200 activists of the Bhartiya Janata
party, the largest opposition party, averting an attempt to disrupt the
first day of the Maharashtra legislative assembly's latest session.

FT  13 JUL 93 / Italy seeks to calm row with US on Somalia

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ITALY yesterday sought to calm a growing row with the US over the handling
of military operations in Somalia.
Mr Fabio Fabbri, the defence minister, said it would be a mistake to allow
mutual recriminations between the Italian contingent in Mogadishu and the
US-controlled United Nations forces in Somalia (Unisom) to get out of hand.
Italian forces in Mogadishu, who 10 days ago suffered three killed and 21
wounded, has blamed the US for failing to consult and co-ordinate. This led
at the Tokyo summit of the Group of Seven leading industrial nations to an
agreement between US and Italian officials that the their local diplomats in
Mogadishu should form a political co-ordinating committee.
However, Italian politicians and the press have complained that Italian
troops have been placed in a highly volatile area of the Somali capital and
possess equipment geared to a a humanitarian peace keeping mission - not a
peace enforcement mission which it has now become.
Yesterday Mr Fabbri said Italy had requested 'a reassessment of the aims of
the mission which covers the relationship between the end - pacification,
conciliation and humanitarian aid - and the means.'
The minister went on to warn that there was a real danger that the turn of
events was leading the mission towards 'a long period of combat operations.'
Mr Fabbri's observations coincided with the approval of the budget for
Italy's 2,500 troops in Somalia.
The first six months have cost L553bn (Pounds 237m) and a further L800bn for
the final half of 1993.

FT  13 JUL 93 / Port industry over a barrel: Licences, losses and
over-production
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER WISE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PORT wine shippers say their centuries-old trade is facing a collapse in
prices and the possibility of 30,000 grape growers being left destitute.
The reason is not to do with the world recession but a breakdown in the
balance between sales and production.
The Association of Port Wine Shippers (AEVP) is refusing to make any
commitment about quantities of wine they will buy in 1993 or how much they
will pay. 'We already have millions of pounds tied up in stock,' said one
shipper, 'and we simply cannot undertake to increase our stocks further
without some guarantee that over-production will cease.'
The shippers' underlying fear is that over-production and falling prices
will undermine the prestige of port and its hard won reputation.
In a harshly-worded letter to Mr Anibal Cavaco Silva, the Portuguese prime
minister, the AEVP warns: 'The lowering of consumer prices is discrediting
the product, which could suffer the same fate as sherry, with a swing of
consumption away to competing drinks.'
The association also queries procedures for issuing licences to growers,
expressing concern about what they perceive as a lack of control over
distributing licences.
They note that the Casa do Douro (House of Douro), which controls wine
production in port's demarcated zone in the upper reaches of the Douro
river, has granted licences for more than 100,000 pipes of wine in excess of
the government stipulated total. (A pipe equals 550 litres.)
This means that stocks of port are now vastly in excess of forecast demand,
even allowing for the 'law of the third'. This was imposed to guarantee a
minimum age for port on the market and states that a company cannot sell
more in a given year than one-third of stocks in December of the previous
year.
Buyers for European supermarkets that purchase large quantities of port for
bottling under their own label have taken advantage of the over-production
and the price of buyer's-own-brand (BOB) port has dropped 20 per cent over
the past year. Over-production has also hit premium branded port.
The pressure of over-production is now coming to a head and the hardest-hit
victims will be the grape farmers of the upper Douro valley. The region was
the first to be demarcated in 1756 and farmers are totally dependent on
vines for their livelihoods.
Farmers, forced by over-production to sell below cost, face real hardships
and there have been angry demonstrations in the streets of Regua, the
grape-growing capital.
The amount of wine that can be produced each year is stipulated by a
government body, the Port Wine Institute (IVP), on a basis of existing
stocks, forecast sales and other factors.
But the responsibility for distributing individual licences stating how much
farmers can produce and of what quality, falls to the Casa do Douro.
This is a corporate body left over from the Salazar dictatorship, to which
all farmers must belong. Besides allocating growing licences, it also
represents farmers in terms of prices fixed with the shippers and buys
excess production from growers.
From 1986 the Casa do Douro began issuing production licences far in excess
of the overall limit set by the IVP. By 1992 the accumulated excess had
reached more than 100,000 pipes. In 1992, the shippers stepped in to buy the
excess production of the 1991 harvest themselves to stop the market from
being flooded.
The shippers point out that the biggest excesses came in an election year
and that the votes of 30,000 farmers were clearly more important than 40
shippers. Some shippers have hinted at corruption saying 'the money for
election campaigns has to come from somewhere'.
The Casa de Douro complicated the issue even further in 1990 when it bought
40 per cent of the second largest Port shipper, Real Companhia Velha (RCV).
The Italian financier Carlo De Benedetti and his Portuguese partner recently
pulled out of RCV after a year of management squabbles. The Casa do Douro is
burdened with debts of over Es25bn and stocks that may be worth a lot less
than the market prices that body's supporting banks attribute to them.
The solution, according to the shippers, is to wipe the Casa do Douro's
massive stocks off the market by distilling them into grape brandy and to
hand over production licences to a more independent body such as the IVP.
The AEVP urges low production levels over the next few years to restore the
balance between stocks and demand.
'We've just been all over Europe holding tastings to celebrate 1991 as a
vintage year,' said one shipper, 'but the truth is the trade is in deep
trouble and something needs to be done very quickly.'

SERB forces yesterday seized the strategic village of Trnovo to the west of
Gorazde in an effort to tighten their stranglehold on the Moslem enclave
proclaimed a United Nations 'safe area'.
Bosnian Serb fighters yesterday celebrated what they called the 'liberation'
of Trnovo and the seizure of the Rogoj mountain pass and surrounding
villages. Radio Belgrade said General Ratko Mladic, the nationalist Serb
commander, had personally conducted the campaign for Trnovo, 18 miles south
of Sarajevo. The Bosnian capital is now even more vulnerable to its Serb
besiegers on the surrounding hills.
The latest Serb advance drives a wedge between Gorazde and Sarajevo, both
Moslem enclaves supposedly under UN protection.
At least 12 people were killed and 15 wounded in the Dobrinja area of the
capital when a Serb mortar exploded in a crowd queueing for water. Serb
forces have cut supplies of water, electricity and fuel. The water supply is
about a half litre per person each day.
Fighting intensified in most parts of Bosnia, according to local media
reports. Radio Sarajevo said the Croatian Defence Council (HVO) was
deploying reinforcements to Mostar, the southwestern city. It said the
Moslem-held towns of Fojnica, Jablanica and Konjic were under Croat attack.
A British UN soldier was wounded near Gornji Vakuf, central Bosnia, when his
vehicle hit a mine on an aid route.
Serbian radio said Moslem fighters had 'retreated in panic leaving behind
scores of dead and large quantities of weapons and ammunition. . . . These
successful activities dealt a serious blow to the Moslem forces, smashing
their dream of linking by violent means through centuries old Serbian
territory.' Moslems comprised 69 per cent of the 6,900 population of Trnovo.
As the international community tries to press the Bosnian presidency to
accept the republic's ethnic partition, Serb forces are pushing to enlarge
their state, which covers some 70 per cent of Bosnia. Croats, too, are
consolidating territory for their ethnic mini-state.
A Bosnian Serb army statement yesterday claimed its offensive was prompted
by Moslem attempts to widen a corridor used to transport supplies to tens of
thousands of Moslems trapped in Gorazde.
Hopes for progress at the Geneva peace talks were made more remote after
bilateral talks broke down between Zagreb officials and Serb rebels from
Croatia. Croatia plans to set up a pontoon bridge on July 18 which Serbs
have vowed to destroy raising fears of the re-ignition of the war.
Britain said yesterday it was increasing its bilateral aid to Bosnia by more
than 50 per cent, giving an extra Pounds 18.5m for food, logistical
assistance and infrastructure projects, Reuter reports. Baroness Chalker,
overseas development minister, made the announcement after a meeting in
London with Mrs Sadako Ogata, UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
Islamic foreign ministers meeting yesterday promised more than 7,600 troops
for a UN protection force in Bosnia, a spokesman said. He declined to name
which of the 16 countries at the two-day meeting in Islamabad made the
offers.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RICHARD BRANSON'S Virgin Megastore has set out to try to prove that France's
1906 Sunday trading law is an ass, and has found the new French government
sympathetic to its case.
Fined FFr500,000 (Pounds 58,000) in 1990 for trying to open its Paris,
Bordeaux and Marseilles stores on Sundays, Virgin was last year given a
one-year 'derogation' allowing it to open its Champs Elysees store.
This ran out last week, when a Paris tribunal ruled that compact discs and
Virgin's other wares were not essential fare for tourists, and the local
prefet - or government representative - refused to renew Virgin's exemption.
Virgin decided to pretend that last Sunday did not exist by staying open for
38 hours from 10am on Saturday until one minute past midnight on Monday
morning. It attracted 100,000 people into its Champs Elysees store, sold
30,000 CDs, and landed the government with an awkward political problem.
But given rising national unemployment, Mr Michel Giraud and Mr Alain
Madelin, ministers of labour and enterprise respectively, seem ready to risk
the wrath of small shopkeepers. They said they would look with favour on
Sunday opening by companies which could prove they were creating jobs or, if
forced to close on Sundays, would have to cut jobs.
Mr Pierre Delmas, Virgin Stores' French director-general, said yesterday the
Champs Elysees shop had done 20 per cent of its weekly turnover on Sundays
in the past year. If forced to close, it would have to shed 15 per cent of
its staff. 'If we get the right to open on Sundays across the country, and
open four new megastores a year, then at the end of five years we could
create up to 800 new jobs,' he claimed.
France's Sunday trading law and practice is no less erratic than in other
European countries, as shown by the fact that Ikea, the warehouse furniture
chain, is allowed to open its shop to the north of Paris on Sundays but is
forced to shut another to the south of Paris.

<TEXT>
MR MANFRED ABELEIN, German vice-president on the board of the European Bank
for Reconstruction and Development, yesterday denied that Bonn was about to
replace him because of business dealings in east Germany.
The German finance minister, Mr Theo Waigel, also rejected a report in Der
Spiegel, that he and Chancellor Helmut Kohl had decided to replace him at
the bank, whose president, Mr Jacques Attali, quit two weeks ago.
Mr Abelein issued a statement that his activities on behalf of the east
German car manufacturer, SAZ - the state enterprise which produced the
Trabant - preceded his appointment as a director of the bank. He denied
having had any second job while working at the bank.
He was involved at SAZ as a legal adviser for the sale of its drive-shaft
works, eventually bought by Britain's GKN. Subsequently, Mr Abelein, for 25
years a Christian Democrat MP and a close colleague of Mr Kohl, became a
member, and then chairman, of the SAZ supervisory board.
Der Spiegel claims Mr Abelein and a business partner, Mr Werner Frantz,
submitted a bill for their activities on behalf of the company totalling
more than DM6.5m, (Pounds 2.55m) based on an estimated value of the
drive-shaft works of DM203m. It says the bill was questioned by SAZ
management, and reduced by over DM2m.
Mr Abelein said his fees had been investigated by a neutral source at his
request, and an agreement reached with the Treuhand privatisation agency on
an agreed sum. He gave up his position as chairman of the SAZ supervisory
board at the end of 1992.
Philip Stephens, Political Editor, adds: The British Treasury last night
declined to damp speculation that Mr John Major is set to propose Lord
Lawson, the former chancellor, to replace Mr Attali.

<TEXT>
ITALIAN police yesterday arrested Mr Franco Freda, a well known right-wing
extremist, on charges of organising a neo-Nazi party and of racism. At least
six other people were detained in different parts of the country.
Organising a neo-Nazi or fascist party has been a crime since 1952, but it
is the first time legislation, approved last month, to clamp down on racism
has been used.
The arrests suggest the authorities are taking seriously the threat of
organised attacks against immigrants and incitement to racism, especially in
the light of developments in Germany. In the past year some 300 actions by
right-wing extremists have been reported.
Mr Freda recently founded the National Front, which magistrates believe is
run from Verona. He was acquitted in 1985 of involvement in one of Italy's
main unresolved terrorist incidents, the bombing of Milan's Piazza Fontana
in 1969 when 17 people were killed and hundreds wounded.

GERMAN insider traders will face a jail term of up to five years, according
to a draft law published by the German finance ministry yesterday.
The law is designed to enhance the competitiveness of Finanzplatz
Deutschland - Germany as a financial centre - by bringing the regulatory
environment for the German securities industry up to international
standards.
Central to this is the criminalisation of insider dealing, a practice which
is treated as a form of theft in the UK, the US and other major industrial
countries, but remains legal, though increasingly frowned-upon in Germany.
Other measures include:
Companies will be obliged to disclose shareholdings in other companies when
they reach 5 per cent, rather than at 25 per cent at present. Failure to
make the disclosure will be subject to a fine of DM500,000 (Pounds 196,850)
and could result in loss of the right to exercise voting control over the
shares.
It will create a German equivalent of the Securities &amp; Exchange Commission,
the centralised supervisory body for the US securities industry.
It will set the minimal nominal value of German shares at DM5 rather than
the current DM50 in a deliberate bid to make German shares more attractive
to international investors who, the draft law argues, are deterred from
investing in German equities because of prices ranging from DM500 to DM1000
per share.
The law, likely to be enacted in the first half of next year, divides
insider dealing into two categories. Primary violators will be those have
direct access to sensitive information because of their position, for
example within company management, or as a shareholder or member of a
supervisory board. Secondary violators will be those who deal on sensitive
information obtained from primary sources, for which the jail term will be
three years.
The law is based on draft proposals floated by the finance ministry in
January of last year. The delay, which in part reflects the technical and
political difficulties of devising a regulatory structure for the German
markets, has more recently become an embarrassment for Germany in the wake
of controversial share purchases by Mr Franz Steinkuhler, the former head of
the IG Metall Union.
Mr Steinkuhler denied dealing in insider information gained from his
position on the supervisory board of Daimler when he bought shares in
Mercedes Holding (MAH), a Daimler-Benz holding company, shortly before an
announcement which led to a sharp rise in MAH's share price. The dealings
served to expose the inadequacies of the regulatory environment in Germany
and senior bankers called for an acceleration in the pace of reforms.

ATTEMPTS to agree a ceasefire in the violent struggle for the port of
Sukhumi in the Georgian province of Abkhazia broke down yesterday in Moscow.
At the same time, Mr Eduard Shevardnadze, the Georgian leader, warned in the
Black Sea port that he was prepared to take harsher action to put down the
revolt in the province, where separatists have waged an 18-month struggle to
secede from Georgia and join the Russian federation.
Mr Shevardnadze, who has twice come under shell-fire at his army
headquarters in Sukhumi, said on Sunday: 'Perhaps we must look at resolving
this conflict through a combination of military and peaceful means. Until
now we have tried to use only peaceful means.'
Hopes for a negotiated ceasefire through the mediation of Mr Boris
Pastukhov, Russia's deputy foreign minister, faded yesterday on Abkhazian
demands. These insisted that an Abkhazian parliament and other institutions
be permitted to return to Sukhumi and begin work as soon as a ceasefire was
agreed, a condition unacceptable to the Georgian side, which still claims
authority over Abkhazia.
Most of the province is now in secessionist hands, except for the disputed
capital of Sukhumi and the town of Ochamchira.
Russia is accused by many Georgians of supplying military and other
assistance to the Abkhazian side. However, Mr Shevardnadze at the weekend
said that Mr Tengiz Sigua, the prime minister, had been wrong to threaten to
break off diplomatic relations with Moscow. Such a move was 'unthinkable'.

FT  13 JUL 93 / Constitutional reform a step closer in Russia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD and DMITRI VOLKOV
</BYLINE>

   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RUSSIA nudged a little closer to its goal of becoming a law-based state
yesterday when its constitutional convention approved by a large majority a
draft constitution setting out the fundamentals of a democratic country
based on market principles.
Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, said that 'it's now clear that
without a principled resolution of the constitutional problem further
progress on economic reform is simply impossible in principle'.
The document, which runs to 133 articles, now passes for further revision to
the assemblies of the regions and republics across Russia - a sure recipe,
as Mr Yeltsin tacitly acknowledged, for further delay and extensive
revision. The redrafted document is unlikely to be ready by Mr Yeltsin's
target date of early August for approval by the convention.
At least a third of the representatives from the regions and the republics -
who were the dominant force in the constitutional convention - did not
initial the document, and even those who did made it clear that their
parliaments were free to revise the document radically.
Mr Victor Stepanov, head of the Karelia republic, said: 'We'll take at least
two months to go through this properly and there are many things we don't
like in it.'
Mr Yeltsin, in his speech to the convention, said that the new phenomenon of
'republicanisation' - regions naming themselves republics in order to
qualify for greater privileges under the new constitution - was a futile
exercise because, under the constitution, regions and republic had equal
rights. This, however, is itself a further cause of difficulty since the
republics, traditionally favoured in the Soviet system, wish to preserve
their differential privilege.
The draft constitution gives a number of concessions to the regions - giving
them the right to have their own 'charter' as an antidote to their complaint
that republics have the right to a constitution.
They also have the right to promulgate new laws - though, as Mr Yeltsin
noted, the tax regime is still undefined between the centre and the regions
and republics.
The draft also allows regions and republics to sign separate treaties on
bilateral relations with Moscow - a clause inserted at the insistence of the
Tatar republic, the most powerful and independent-minded of all the subjects
of the federation.
Under the existing constitution, the draft will eventually need to cross the
hurdle of being approved by the existing parliament, which is an unlikely
prospect. The president's advisers now seem inclined to propose that the
convention pass a law on elections - a law which would allow elections later
this year to a new form of parliament which would then adopt the
constitution.

FT  13 JUL 93 / Weak economy helps drop in French inflation to 1.9%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SHARP falls in the price of food and crude oil and weak economic activity
kept French consumer prices stable in June, Insee, the national statistics
institute announced yesterday.
The annual rate of inflation fell slightly from 2 per cent in May to 1.9 per
cent, its lowest rate since last December.
Mr Edmond Alphandery, the economics minister, said the figures showed France
had managed to maintain a favourable inflation rate compared with its
principal trading partners. But economists in Paris said the figures also
reflected the impact of recession.
'With the rise in unemployment, which is expected to exceed 12 per cent by
the end of the year, and with gloomy economic statistics, consumers are
preferring to save rather than spend,' said an economist at one French bank.
'The government may welcome low inflation, but it is also a sign of
declining activity.'
Food prices fell by 0.7 per cent in June compared with May, while oil prices
were 0.4 per cent lower. Prices of manufactured products fell by 0.1 per
cent compared with May. The stability in the consumer price index in June,
which was unchanged to 0.1 per cent lower, occurred despite two increases in
tobacco taxes during the spring.
The increases raised tobacco prices by 4.6 in June, compared with May.
Seasonally adjusted, Insee said that retail prices in June showed a slight
increase of between 0.1 and 0.2 per cent.
They said that the reduction in inflationary pressure also reflected a
reduction in import prices following currency devaluations by several of
France's trading partners.
A spokesman for the institute said that consumer prices were likely to
increase again over the next few months. He said that an increase of 5.3 per
cent in petrol taxes, imposed from yesterday, and a 16 per cent increase in
the duty on alcoholic drinks from July 1, would feed through into a higher
inflation rate.

THE Italian government is considering raising L32,000bn-L35,000bn (Pounds
13.7bn-Pounds 15bn) in extra revenues and spending cuts in the 1994 budget,
writes Robert Graham in Rome. The aim is to hold the public sector deficit
next year to L150,000bn, a small reduction on the 1993 target of L155,000bn.
The budget outlines emerged yesterday as the government indicated it hoped
to have the details agreed in cabinet either by the end of this week or
early next. Today, Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, prime minister, will be
unveiling to parliament his government's three-year macro-economic
projections for 1994-96. This will in turn provide the framework for
discussion of the 1994 budget.

FT  13 JUL 93 / Opel leak shocks motor industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOTOR industry executives yesterday expressed surprise at the German
announcement that plans for Opel's top-secret model had been found in a flat
in Wiesbaden, saying theirs was an industry that was generally free of
industrial espionage.
They said manufacturers searching for ways of increasing competitiveness
normally had relatively little difficulty keeping them in-house thanks to
the industry's 'confidentiality clause' contract system.
Engineers, senior managers and others with access at an early stage to new
model programmes, investment and technology strategies have these clauses
written into their contracts - and few have been known to abuse them.
'The reason is fairly obvious in the case of anyone whose career is in the
industry,' one UK motor industry executive who wished to remain anonymous
said last night.
'There might be a short-term gain for someone moving confidential
information from one company to another. But in the long-term? What does
that engineer or executive do if he or she wants or needs to make another
move? The word would have got around about what had happened. Put simply,
there would be nowhere else in the industry for that person to go.'
The system has also survived substantial change in the organisation and
processes of the industry which have meant that many more people than even
five years ago necessarily have knowledge of key projects and strategies at
an early stage.
'The days when a car maker's board had all the good ideas and took decisions
behind closed doors has gone,' said another.
'If it's a significant project, it will involve the use of a centralised
computer database and require information and input at an early stage from
people in middle management, engineers and similar.'

FT  13 JUL 93 / Community ministers build on summit growth initiative
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN Community finance ministers yesterday provisionally approved loan
facilities worth Ecu8bn (Pounds 6.18bn), to try to speed economic recovery
and build on the modest 'growth initiative' agreed at last December's
Edinburgh summit.
If confirmed, after more work on the details of the loans, the move amounts
to a sort of deficit-financing, in which the EC has not previously indulged.
The facilities take the form of an Ecu5bn bridging loan for mainly
infrastructure projects across the Community; Ecu2bn in European Investment
Bank loans for cross-border transport and communications networks; and
Ecu1bn in soft loans to small and medium-sized industries.
The bridging loan will be repaid, by 1999, out of the structural funds, the
Ecu141.5bn regional and structural aid package agreed at Edinburgh. The
intention is for the EC to borrow in the markets to speed up this
development spending.
The soft loans for small to medium-sized companies will have an interest
rate subsidy of about Ecu129m, part financed out of the EC budget and part
paid for from the structural funds.
Agreement on how to share out the structural funds is at the moment held up
by a wrangle over how big a share should go to Ireland, one of the four
poorest member states which receive favoured treatment to enable them to
catch up with average EC income levels.
Separately, the ministers failed to unblock a measure increasing EC travel
allowances. Germany had blocked an agreement in principle last year, linking
any go-ahead to agreement on an EC-wide road charges system and
liberalisation of road haulage.
Both these issues were the subject of a political agreement on June 19, but
Germany appears anxious to see the final text on the road transport measures
before surrendering its last negotiating ace.

FT  13 JUL 93 / Clarke targets welfare costs
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR KENNETH CLARKE, the chancellor, yesterday gave a blunt warning of future
government spending cuts to resolve the most serious deterioration in public
finances since the sterling crisis of 1976.
Mr Clarke, who spoke after the meeting of European Community finance
ministers in Brussels, pledged tough action to reduce the Pounds 50bn budget
deficit. He repeated his warning that he might have to increase taxes in the
November budget as a way of raising revenue. He also hinted that Britain's
rising social security bill would come under close scrutiny in the
government's attempts to prune the deficit.
The chancellor's warning came as a Treasury document submitted to the EC
finance ministers pointed to the rising burden on the public finances of
social security spending.
Mr Clarke spoke of a 'remorseless' rise in UK public spending due to an
ageing population, growing numbers of people in higher education and
increasing claims in items such as invalidity benefits. He said:
'Discretionary expenditure does not come free. The reason why public
spending is rising remorselessly is partly the ageing population and partly
the increasing take-up of benefits.' The latter factor was a desirable thing
but had to be re-examined in the light of the public borrowing, he said.
His remarks were in response to questions raised by his EC partners about
Britain's aim to reduce the budget deficit to 3 per cent of gross domestic
product by 1997, in line with the Maastricht treaty's goal of economic and
monetary union. The Treasury document submitted to the finance ministers'
meeting is based on the March Budget and shows 'cyclical' social security
spending rising dramatically from a total of Pounds 10.9bn in 1991-2 to
Pounds 18.5bn in 1997-1998.
These figures include unemployment benefit and income support for people of
working age, particularly single parents whose numbers are increasing,
according to Treasury officials.

FT  13 JUL 93 / EC ministers pledge tough measures to cut deficits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN Community finance ministers yesterday pledged to take tough action
to resolve the crisis in public finances among member states and accepted
that tax rises might be required to restore budgetary stability.
In response to a series of grim warnings from EC central bank governors from
the 12 member states, ministers agreed that spending cuts alone might not be
enough to reduce public borrowing, which has soared as a result of the
recession.
Latest estimates by the European Commission show that the aggregate public
sector deficit as a proportion of Community gross domestic product is likely
to rise to more than 6 per cent this year - the highest level in the
Community's 36-year history.
Despite mounting evidence of the fiscal crisis facing EC member states,
ministers insisted they would stick to the strict targets for economic and
monetary union laid down by the Maastricht treaty, including a commitment to
reduce individual budget deficits to 3 per cent of gross domestic product.
Mr Phillipe Maystadt, the Belgian finance minister who chaired the meeting,
said governments had 'precious little lee-way' for relaxing budget deficits
to offset the effects of the recession. Any such move would be
short-sighted, he said.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, UK chancellor, said Britain remained committed to the
Maastricht targets. He left open the possibility of tax increases in the
November budget to reduce the UK's Pounds 50bn deficit. During yesterday's
meeting, ministers gave Mr Clarke a relatively gentle ride over the UK's
'convergence plan' - the forecasts for meeting the Maastricht criteria for
Emu. They described the plan as 'ambitious' but 'based on realistic
assumptions'. A more vigorous budgetary adjustment might be necessary if the
pace of economic recovery proved slower than expected.
Two weeks ago, treasury officials from member states meeting in the EC's
monetary committee had asked whether the UK was over-estimating the impact
of future economic growth on cutting the deficit.
Mr Clarke said the UK's forecasts contained tougher targets on spending than
convergence plans submitted by other states. He noted the UK was likely to
grow faster than its main EC competitors in 1993 and 1994.
The meeting was overshadowed by warnings from EC central bank governors and
the EC's economic policy committee about the fiscal crisis in the EC.
In a submission to the ministers, the central bankers said: 'Concern about
the present state of public finances is particularly warranted since the
rise in budget deficits over the last few years cannot simply be ascribed to
the cyclical downturn.
'They also reflect to a significant extent structural factors which have
been adding to imbalances since 1989.' Signalling agreement, finance
ministers stressed that structural measures to correct budgetary imbalances
were essential so as to return the EC to higher growth.

FT  13 JUL 93 / German support fails to halt franc's decline

   PARIS, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bundesbank intervened in international currency markets yesterday in an
attempt to support the French franc which came under attack in the European
exchange rate mechanism.
Heavy selling of the franc pushed it below FFr3.41 to the D-Mark, less than
two centimes above its ERM floor of FFr3.4305. The franc closed in London at
FFr3.416, around its lowest level since the beginning of the year, compared
with last Friday's close of FFr3.399. In late trading in New York, the
French currency stood at FFr3.4145.
As well as intervention by the German central bank, the franc's fall
prompted a statement of support from Mr Theo Waigel, the German finance
minister.
He said the fundamentals of the French economy were still healthy and
confirmed the strength of Franco-German co-operation in monetary policy.
Speaking in Brussels at a meeting of finance ministers, Mr Waigel said
further cuts in German interest rates were both possible and desirable.
The Bundesbank council meets on Thursday, but analysts discounted the
prospect of a cut in rates unless pressure on the franc became more acute.
They said the franc had been weakened by pessimistic reports about the
French economy. A report last week by Insee, the national statistics office,
forecast that gross domestic product would fall 0.7 per cent this year and
that the jobless rate would rise to 12.5 per cent by the end of December.
Mr Edmond Alphandery, the French economics minister, said yesterday that
maintaining the D-Mark-franc exchange rate was an 'absolute imperative',
describing the current parity as 'the backbone of the construction of
Europe'.
But economists said they expected the weakness of the franc to continue as
investors moved short and long-term funds out of the French currency.
Nevertheless, analysts in Paris were sanguine about the franc's prospects.
'We are in for a bumpy ride,' said a currency expert at a French bank. 'But
the franc has withstood several crises and the government cannot afford to
retreat on its commitment to the current ERM parity.'
A survey by Idea, the London-based financial information company, showed
that 40 per cent of dealers expect the franc to be devalued before the
year-end.

FT  13 JUL 93 / UN to maintain Somali action despite bloodshed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE United Nations last night rejected an Italian government request to
suspend military action in Somalia after UN helicopter gunships bombarded a
command centre of Somali warlord Mohamed Farah Aideed, killing more than a
dozen Somalis.
Two foreign journalists, a Briton and a German, were killed when an angry
mob took to the streets of Mogadishu seeking revenge for the UN strike.
They were named as Mr Dan Eldon of Reuters and Mr Hansi Krauss of Associated
Press. Both were photographers. Two other journalists were missing and
feared dead, and a further two were injured.
Supporters of Gen Aideed claimed that up to 73 Somalis were dead. The bodies
of 16 Somalis who had died in the air raid were paraded through the streets
and it was claimed more were lying in the ruins of the Aideed compound. A UN
official said 13 Somalis were killed and about 11 wounded.
In Rome, Mr Fabio Fabbri, Italy's defence minister, said he would ask the US
and the UN to suspend combat operations in Somalia in an attempt to reduce
tension in the former Italian colony. 'We suggest a cooling-off period to
reduce tension, the suspension of combat operations and a renewed effort to
restore dialogue,' he said. Italy has deployed 2,600 troops in Somalia.
Tension has escalated since Somali gunmen ambushed and killed 23 Pakistani
peacekeepers on June 5. Since then, a further 22 UN soldiers have been
killed. Many more Somalis have died during night-time air raids against Gen
Aideed's strongholds. But the UN military operation has failed to capture
the general, who went into hiding after an arrest warrant was issued against
him on June 17.
In New York, Mr Joe Sills, a UN official, emphasised that peacekeeping
operations were mandated by the UN Security Council and were not subject to
decision by individual members. He told reporters that Mr Boutros Boutros
Ghali, the UN secretary-general, felt 'very strongly' that in any UN
operation the force commander must be in total control, while working within
the council mandate.
Mr Sills refused to single out Italy for reproach and commented that 'a
number' of providers of UN contingents had sought a freer hand in Somalia.
'There have been problems in this regard,' he added.
General Bruno Loi, the Italian commander, is said often to have failed to
consult the UN force commander, General Civek Bir of Turkey.
For example, on July 2 when three soldiers were killed and 30 wounded in an
ambush of 800 Italian troops, the UN was not informed in advance of a
weapons search operation in which the Italians were engaged, and learnt
about it only when urgent American support was requested.
Speaking on behalf of Mr Boutros Ghali, Mr Sills said it was unacceptable to
the UN and the Security Council for any member state to instruct its
national contingent and unacceptable for a contingent to seek instructions
from its national capital. Gen Bir has American and Pakistani deputies, but
the Italians have accused the UN of running the show and have sought a
bigger role in decision making.
Mr Sills said they were not alone in seeking senior appointments to Gen
Bir's staff.

FT  13 JUL 93 / Government to clamp down on West End ticket agencies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TICKET agencies which exploit West End theatregoers, especially tourists,
are to be curbed by the government. Some buyers have ended up paying Pounds
45 for a Pounds 7 balcony seat at Miss Saigon.
Resellers of tickets for theatres, concerts and similar events will be
forced to tell the customer the standard of the seat being offered,
including its face value.
Baroness Denton, consumer affairs minister, said yesterday: 'Unless they buy
directly from the box office, consumers can often pay Pounds 50 or more for
a ticket whose face value is much lower, say Pounds 6. People may not find
this out until they collect the ticket just before the performance.'
Ms Susan Whiddington, development officer of the Society of West End
Theatre, said: 'This is the best news we could possibly have.' Her
organisation receives up to 30 complaints a week from disgruntled tourists
and has long pushed for a change in the law.
The new legislation is not aimed specifically at ticket touts. The feeling
is that someone who buys a ticket in the street does not deserve protection.
The main problem is the 130 or so ticket agencies that have sprung up
throughout the West End and which have an aura of respectability. They
extract exorbitant sums from theatregoers, give them a voucher and then
arrange for a low-price ticket to be collected at the theatre.
Although most of the trade is in tickets for the handful of popular,
sold-out shows such as Phantom of the Opera and Crazy for You, the agencies
also take advantage of the ignorance of visitors by selling them tickets for
plays that are easy to get into. One recent complaint came from an
out-of-town holidaymaker who paid Pounds 25 for a Pounds 14 ticket for The
Mousetrap, which has been running for more than 40 years.
Many of the 50 theatres in the West End have tickets readily available for
most weekday performances this summer.
The recession has reduced audiences by 3 per cent on last year's level.
Half-price tickets to some shows are sold from an official booth in
Leicester Square, and other two-for-one schemes exist.
Specialist agencies, such as Ticket Master, First Call and Edwards &amp;
Edwards, invariably tell their customers that they are charging a premium of
up to 25 per cent on the face value of their tickets.

FT  12 JUL 93 / Russian ship tied up in web of creditors' claims
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RONALD VAN DE KROL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROTTERDAM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FOR 13 months, the Russian cargo ship Kapitan Kanevskiy has been chained to
the quayside in Rotterdam harbour while lawyers argue in court about Dollars
4.4m in unpaid bills for the delivery of children's and women's clothing to
the former Soviet Union.
The ship, operated by the St Petersburg-based, state-owned Baltic Shipping
Company, was impounded in June last year in what is believed to be the first
seizure of Russian physical assets over a payments dispute with western
creditors.
The dispute is a minefield of complexities, raising difficult questions
about the ownership of property and assets under the old communist system
and whether they are applicable today. The details centre on the non-payment
of goods in the crucial years 1990 and 1991, when the Soviet Union collapsed
in chaos and gave way to the Commonwealth of Independent States.
The case is arousing interest in the Netherlands, where at least 50 other
companies without export credit insurance are waiting to be paid for Fl 350m
(Dollars 185m) worth of goods supplied during this period.
Now the fate of the Kapitan Kanevskiy is starting to win attention abroad.
Alfred C. Toepfer, the German commodities trader, filed a petition in
Rotterdam last week asking for permission to 'arrest' a ship of the Russian
Federation as part of its dispute with the Russian authorities about
non-payment for deliveries of cigarettes, personal care products and other
western goods in 1990 and 1991. No date has yet been set for the court's
ruling.
The lawyer for the plaintiff in the Dutch case, a small Amsterdam-based
trading company called Pied-Rich BV, maintains that the court battle could
have implications for 'The Dutch laws on attachment are very liberal,
meaning that a US company could have Russian property arrested in the
Netherlands even if the claim does not involve the Netherlands,' Mr Ton
Steinz, of the Amsterdam law firm Steinz and Van der Veen, said.
Pied-Rich's dispute is not with its Russian customers or with the Russian
shipping company but with the Russian state. It says the former Soviet
Ministry of Merchant Marine guaranteed in 1990 it would act as the vehicle
for paying the Russian customers' bills. This was agreed as part of a wider
arrangement whereby the Dutch company was committed to finding cargo
business for Baltic.
When Dollars 4.4m in bills for 1990 and 1991 were not paid, the Dutch
company petitioned a Rotterdam court to have the Kapitan Kanevskiy, valued
at some Dollars 16m, impounded in Rotterdam harbour. The ship has been under
'protective arrest' since June 14 1992.
In court documents, lawyers for the Russian Federation accuse the Dutch
company and its lawyers of abusing Dutch laws on property seizure and of
attempting to use 'blackmail' to get the Russians to settle their debts.
They say the impounding of the ship has already cost the company Fl 1.75m in
direct costs as well as at least Fl 3.5m in lost revenue.
The 13th lawsuit associated with the main legal case was heard in a
municipal court last week. The proceedings turn partly on whether the ship
can be considered Russian state property, raising a host of questions about
property rights and leasing under the old communist system.
The main legal case, which centres on whether the ship can be sold at
auction if the debt is not repaid, is expected to drag on into 1994.
A parallel arbitration case is pending in Moscow.
Although it is being watched by other Dutch companies, the case cannot
necessarily be 'extrapolated' to those of other creditors, according to one
industry observer who is familiar with other uninsured Dutch claims. He
noted that the Pied-Rich dispute involves a particularly complicated,
tripartite payment system, as does the Toepfer case.
'Other creditors prefer to follow the diplomatic route so that they don't
harm future trading relations,' he said.

FT  12 JUL 93 / Spanish judge again rejects KIO plea to try ex-chairman
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BRUCE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SPAIN'S senior financial crimes judge has for the third time this year
rejected efforts by the Kuwait Investment Office to open criminal
proceedings against the former chairman of the KIO, Sheikh Fahad Mohammed Al
Sabah, and the former management of the KIO's troubled Spanish industrial
investments.
The KIO claims that it lost all Dollars 5bn invested in Spain in the
mid-1980s because of mismanagement and that up to Dollars 500m of this was
stolen. The judge, rejecting a new KIO writ on Friday, said the Kuwaitis had
produced no new evidence and there was no evidence in the writ of criminal
conduct. The KIO will appeal, for the second time.
The tortuous efforts of the KIO to get an investigation opened in Spain
coincide with indications that a civil writ issued against many of the same
defendants in London is also likely to become bogged down in arguments over
jurisdiction. While the KIO is headquartered in London, most of the
allegedly criminal behaviour by former Kuwaiti and Spanish managers took
place in Spain.
The new rebuff for the KIO in Spain comes alongside publication of a Kuwaiti
parliamentary investigation into the KIO's big losses in Spain, in which a
senior KIO official is quoted as saying he was told in 1990 by Sheikh Fahad
not to speak of a secret transfer of Dollars 300m from Spain to secret KIO
accounts as the money was being used to make 'political' payments.
The transfer occurred during the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, when the emirate
was looking for international support to help eject the invaders. While the
position of the Kuwaiti government is that no funds were used to make
political payments and that the money was, indeed, stolen, the parliamentary
commission report says it could not find a good explanation as to why it had
been decided to make criminal charges in Spain and civil ones in the UK. It
recommended that the KIO drop its traditional legal advisers, Stephenson
Harwood.

FT  12 JUL 93 / President Clinton's economic Jeeves
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It may seem absurd to compare Mr Robert Rubin, the director of the White
House National Economic Council, with Bertie Wooster's fictional manservant
Jeeves. Yet in a town over-populated with brash, assertive personalities,
his self-effacing, low-key demeanour really does bring the omniscient Jeeves
to mind.
Gleefully playing up Mr Rubin's deferential style, the Washington Post
recently reported his habit of prefacing his rare interjections in White
House meetings with the words 'in my humble opinion.' One can almost imagine
him presenting economic options to Mr Clinton on a silver platter; although
he knows 10 times as much about finance as the president, he apparently
hesitates to indicate a strong preference for one policy over another.
Mr Rubin's apparent lack of ego is seen as especially puzzling given that he
has spent his working life on Wall Street. One of the most successful
arbitrageurs of his generation, he ended up as a co-chairman of Goldman
Sachs, the investment bank. Last year he reported earnings of Dollars 26.5m
(Pounds 17.6m), making him unusually wealthy, even by the standards of Mr
Clinton's well-heeled Cabinet.
During a 40-minute interview in his panelled office in the west wing of the
White House, Mr Rubin stuck resolutely to his type-casting. I could not get
him to express a really strong opinion about anything, even off the record.
When asked for his personal views, he tended to reply by deftly outlining
the president's policies on the topic in question.
Yet as director of the NEC, Mr Rubin is potentially the most powerful
economic official in Washington. He co-ordinates the activities of all the
other economic agencies and enjoys daily access to the president; more than
anybody else, he is the prism through which Mr Clinton views the economic
world. Yet he rejects flatly any suggestion that he has a specially
important role. He is certainly not Mr Clinton's economic chief of staff, he
says, because that would imply the heads of other agencies report to him,
which they do not.
Does he accept the common criticism that he is too reluctant to express his
own views on policy issues?
'People say that. I really think it's not correct. What you have to do in
this job is to perform your co-ordinating function with real intellectual
integrity so that everybody feels their views are laid out fully and fairly.
Then, separately, you can express your own personal views. . .I don't thump
tables but I don't feel any reticence about coming forward with my views.'
Whatever he says, it is hard to believe that Mr Rubin does harbour strong
personal views on economic policy. What really seems to excite him is
teamwork and the process of brokering agreements. In helping devise the US's
new hard-nosed trade policy towards Japan, for example, Mr Rubin got 'seven,
eight, maybe 10 agencies around the table.' The marathon debate that ensued
was apparently unprecedented in that policies towards Japan have usually
been fashioned independently in particular agencies, such as the treasury,
state or commerce departments.
Yet it was typical of Mr Rubin's mission at the NEC, which is to bring to
economic policy-making the kind of coherence and co-ordination that has long
characterised foreign and diplomatic policy. The NEC is thus consciously
modelled on the National Security Council and Mr Rubin regards his role as
precisely analogous to that of Mr Anthony Lake, the national security
adviser.
Mr Rubin's council has undoubtedly played an important role in formulating
budgetary and trade policy. But quite how far its influence will ultimately
stretch remains unclear. During the election campaign, there was speculation
that a Clinton administration would move beyond traditional macroeconomic
policies and take an active interest in the performance of individual
industries, especially in high-tech sectors. Does Mr Rubin personally have
faith in 'industrial policy.'
I expected - and got - an equivocal response. 'Industrial policy is a funny
word,' he says. 'To 100 people it will mean 200 different things - everybody
has at least two different definitions in mind.' However, he believes there
may be 'externalities' that could justify a more active government role in
some areas. He will not elaborate because he does not want to prejudge the
outcome of the few sectoral studies currently under way. Characteristically,
all he can promise is that a premium will be placed on inter-departmental
co-operation. 'There will be Laura (Tyson), Bob Reich, Lloyd Bentsen, Leon
(Panetta) and myself - and others - sitting at the table and working it out
together as opposed to something happening in one agency that others don't
agree with.'
Mr Rubin is urbane, courteous and, above all, non-ideological. His
self-effacing style is a breath of fresh air in Washington and has gone down
well with more overtly ambitious colleagues. He deserves credit for striving
to create a more rational and co-operative policy making apparatus. But
whether his committee system, which gives a voice to all interested parties
in the federal government, will produce effective policies remains an open
question. Unless the NEC's able director provides a stronger sense of
direction, some observers worry it will end up producing camels.

FT  12 JUL 93 / No nukes is good nukes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN DAVIDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
David Gergen and the other news manipulators did a fine job for their
political masters at the meeting of the Group of Seven leading industrial
nations in Tokyo last week. They got great headlines for the 'agreement' on
a Gatt deal, for the group's hypocritical words on Bosnia, for the Dollars
3bn (Pounds 2bn) aid package for Russia. Considering that the meeting had
gathered amid a general consensus that the G7 was a busted flush, and the
seven leaders the most discredited bunch in recent history, this was quite
an achievement for the spin merchants.
A by-product of this was that the news managers were able to downplay one of
the most serious items on the G7 agenda: the prospect that the world is on
the threshold of an ominous, and quite possibly dangerous, proliferation of
nuclear weapons. The issue is mentioned in the final communique, but in such
deadpan terms that it remained safely on the inside pages.
The first and most immediate cause of anxiety is Ukraine, which after long
debate now seems determined to hang on to at least some of the 176 strategic
nuclear missiles which were part of the Soviet arsenal and happened to be
based on Ukrainian territory. This could jeopardise the radical US-Russian
nuclear arms reductions treaties signed only six months ago; but it could
also give new and dangerous encouragement to other countries to acquire
nuclear weapons.
Then there is North Korea, which is probably engaged on building up its own
nuclear weapons capability, in defiance of its commitment not to do so under
the multilateral nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). This is a
particularly disturbing break-out by a hard-line, communist and militaristic
country. Last week in Tokyo, Japan made it clear that it would regard a
nuclear-armed North Korea as a serious threat to its national security.
Japan could probably build nuclear weapons and their delivery systems in
very short order, if it decided to go down that road. So if North Korea
becomes a nuclear weapons state, we should assume that Japan will, too.
Whether anything can be done to stop North Korea is uncertain. The Americans
have been trying diplomatic arm-twisting in bilateral talks, apparently with
only modest success: Washington is now talking of international sanctions.
Ukraine has not stated unambiguously its intention to become a nuclear
weapons state; but that seems the direction it is heading. President Leonid
Kravchuk said last week that the nuclear missiles should be declared
'national property' (whatever that means) - until they are destroyed. Prime
Minister Leonid Kuchma went further, and said that Ukraine should formally
proclaim itself a nuclear weapons state - until the weapons are removed and
destroyed. In the meantime, US intelligence suspects that the Ukrainians are
working on the electronic codes which control the missiles, and may be able
to crack them in the not-too-distant future.
Ukraine's fundamental objectives remain ambiguous, because the political
class is divided. Sometimes it seems they are just using the missiles as
bargaining counters, to get more financial aid from the west; such an
objective can only have been reinforced by the Tokyo meeting, which offered
Dollars 3bn to Russia but nothing to Ukraine. But sometimes it seems they
regard the missiles as a security guarantee against possible Russian
aggression; and would only give them up in exchange for a security guarantee
from the west. If that is the bottom line, Ukraine will keep the missiles,
because the west will not give such a guarantee.
In the meantime, Ukrainian foot-dragging is blocking the implementation of
the second Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (Start-II) agreed only six months
ago by George Bush and Boris Yeltsin. That agreement should reduce the
long-range nuclear arsenals of Russia and the US by about two-thirds, from
some 11,000-12,000 warheads each to about 3,500 by early next century. But
this treaty cannot go into effect, because Ukraine has not ratified the
previous Start-I treaty of 1991 on which Start-II is built.
But if nuclear proliferation by Ukraine is a by-product of the
disintegration of the Soviet Union, it may be part of a more general
pattern. Kazakhstan is another republic with some former Soviet weapons; but
whereas Kazakhstan has ratified Start-I, it has not signed the NPT as a
non-nuclear weapons state. Iraq's incentive to go nuclear has been
intensified by the end of the cold war, since it can no longer rely on
Soviet military support against the west. Even North Korea may see the end
of the cold war as a reason to build up its national 'security'.
As a result, the official nuclear powers are urgently trying to rebuild the
political credibility of the non-proliferation regime. President Bill
Clinton has extended the US moratorium on nuclear testing for another 15
months, and Russia and France have both given their support to a
comprehensive test ban. The UK government does not share their enthusiasm,
but has enough sense not to object.
The probable collapse of the non-proliferation dyke will have far-reaching
consequences. If nuclear weapons are no longer restricted to the very few,
those who used to claim to be the only legitimate members of the nuclear
club will need new justifications for their political privileges, starting
with permanent membership of the UN Security Council. Sooner or later,
Germany and Japan must get permanent seats, and it would be better if they
did so without acquiring nuclear weapons. Britain and France should make a
virtue of necessity, and urge their admission.

FT  12 JUL 93 / Monday Interview: Optimist's upward curve: Daniel Tully,
chairman of Merrill Lynch, talks to Patrick Harverson
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A golf club rests against a table, pictures of his family adorn the walls,
but no stock market computer screens clutter the desk of the chairman of
America's most powerful financial company.
Mr Daniel Tully, who a week ago took over the helm of Merrill Lynch, the
largest securities house in the US, does not fit the popular image of Wall
Street's elite.
Instead of the intense, blue-blooded financier that people might expect to
run one of the nation's largest investment banks and securities houses, Mr
Tully is a big, cheerfully confident Irish New Yorker, the son of a dockside
steam-fitter from the borough of Queens.
He believes his Irish heritage has helped him to manage a big company with a
large number of staff. 'The Irish have a certain empathy, compassion and a
willingness to put themselves in the other person's shoes.'
He admits that, when he started in the securities business in 1955, he knew
nothing about stockbroking. Neither, it seems, did his mother. Laughing at
the memory, he says: 'When I got the job that day, and went home and told my
mother that I had a job with Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Beane, she
said: 'That's great son. I always knew you would do well in the advertising
business.' '
While he might not have done well in advertising, the 61-year-old Mr Tully
has thrived in stockbroking. After joining Merrill's accounting department,
he worked up through the firm's broking workforce, moving to the New York
head office in 1976.
Six years later, Mr Tully was made head of the firm's private client
business, and in 1985 he was appointed president and chief operating
officer. From 1985, he ran Merrill with his long-time friend and partner, Mr
William Schreyer, who was chairman until his retirement two weeks ago.
During Mr Tully and Mr Schreyer's tenure, Merrill has grown from one of
several dominant firms on Wall Street, to the dominant force. Today, the
firm is pre-eminent in almost every area of the US capital markets - its
brokers earn more commissions than any other firm, its investment bankers
underwrite the most corporate stock and bond issues, and its investment
managers handle more client assets than any financial institution except
Fidelity, the mutual funds group.
Despite the firm's growth, Mr Tully's stint at the top has not been
problem-free. In the latter part of the 1980s, Merrill's rapid expansion
left it with an average return on equity of only 10.8 per cent, well below
the industry average of 15 per cent and in 1989 it made a loss of Dollars
213m (Pounds 142m).
At the time, Mr Tully and Mr Schreyer were criticised for allowing Merrill
to get badly out of shape. Critics and analysts argued that the duo were
great salesmen, but lacked the modern management skills to guide a giant
securities house into the 1990s.
The two responded with a three-year cost-cutting programme, which shrank
Merrill's workforce from 50,000 to just over 40,000. Mr Tully patrolled the
firm's offices, slapping small red dots on equipment and furniture that he
believed was surplus to Merrill's needs.
Today, the red dots have gone but, says Mr Tully, the attention to cost
control has not. Merrill employs what its chairman calls the 'burden of
proof' policy, which regularly asks every unit to justify why it should
remain part of Merrill Lynch. Mr Tully says: 'The burden of proof is on that
organisation to come back to us and sell management on why they are critical
and integral to our long-term strategy and success.' If the management is
not convinced, out comes the axe.
While retreating from some businesses, Merrill has been expanding in others
 -most notably asset management. In common with other big Wall Street firms,
Merrill wants to build up its fee-based revenues as an insurance against the
volatility of its more cyclical businesses such as trading, broking and
underwriting.
Today, Merrill's recurring revenues cover half of its fixed costs. Mr Tully
wants all of the fixed costs covered by the end of the decade. If that
target is reached, Merrill's earnings from broking commissions, trading and
investment banking would be pure profit.
Back in 1955, when Mr Tully joined Merrill, broking commissions represented
virtually all of the firm's earnings. Twenty years later, however, the
industry abandoned fixed broking commissions and Merrill, like many Wall
Street firms, decided to offer a broader range of services to clients and
lock them into long-term relationships.
Consequently, the Merrill of the 1990s is much more than a broker. It is a
large financial services supermarket. It offers individual and corporate
clients everything from banking-type products such as cash accounts, cheque
books and mortgages, to services such as insurance, business loans,
stockbroking, investment management and high-tech corporate finance.
Mr Tully thinks that the firm should follow the clients' needs, rather than
the other way round. 'The logic is, if you focus on your clients, then you
change along with them as they go through their life. It's a recognition
that the only constant is change.'
This attention to the client, he believes, has turned Merrill into the
country's biggest securities house. In spite of the firm's size and the
complexity of its business, Mr Tully has always adopted a style of
management that is straightforward, upbeat and reminiscent of another Irish
American, former President Ronald Reagan.
Mr Tully says: 'I think you could liken my style, absolutely, to a Ronald
Reagan; that is, someone who has vision, principles and who will not get
mired down in the details. That does not mean you don't have a great
knowledge and understanding of the business, but it's built on mutual
respect and trust and the dignity of fellow-individuals. You've got to
believe that from the bottom of your mind and heart. I believe it. I trust
people.'
He trusts his senior managers to get on with managing the firm while he
travels, meeting clients and employees. Slipping into one of his many
anecdotes, he says: 'At a recent conference someone said to me: 'Mr Tully,
how can you manage forty-some thousand people, and Dollars 120bn of balance
sheet?' I said: 'I don't. It's 11.15am and I haven't spoken to my office
yet.' I said: 'Someone is managing 40,000 people, and a lot of people are
managing the balance sheet.' Part of my executive responsibility is to set
priorities, allocate resources and set the tone and principles which will
guide us through the good times and the bad.'
He comes down hard, however, on employees that abuse his trust. 'If you go
outside the parameters,' he says, making a slicing motion across his knees
with his hand, 'I'm not very tolerant.'
Otherwise, he seems a tolerant man and, despite his avowed fondness for
former President Reagan, broadly supportive of the current Democrat
president. 'I applaud President Clinton's deficit-reduction goal, but would
prefer it if he accomplished more through spending cuts rather than tax
increases.' In particular, he is disappointed that there is little in Mr
Clinton's economic policy that encourages savings and investment.
Mr Tully is extremely positive about the US, despite the country's economic
and social problems. Asked if the American dream has fizzled, he answers
vehemently: 'Hell no. I don't think the future has ever been brighter. You
look at all the trends in the United States, and you might see a little
ripple, but the long-term trends are extremely positive. Every chart I look
at starts in the lower left-hand corner and goes to the higher right-hand
corner.'
Sitting in his spacious office, with its view of the river, and those twin
symbols of hope - Ellis Island and the Statue of Liberty - Mr Tully is the
embodiment of the American optimist. There is nothing wrong, he says, with
being an optimist. After all: 'I've never met a rich pessimist.'

FT  12 JUL 93 / Foreign Exchange and Money Markets: Franc in trouble
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE main focus of attention in currency markets this week will be on the
French franc after a week which has seen heavy selling pressure on the
currency in the European exchange rate mechanism, writes James Blitz.
The last 5 trading days have seen an extraordinary fall in the franc's value
against the D-Mark and, on Friday, the currency came below the FFr3.40 level
against the German currency for the first time since March.
More worryingly, the currency was at minus 71 percentage points level
against its ERM divergence indicator, a point close to the one where
European central banks are required to support an ailing currency.
The franc's fortunes this week will be probably be decided by events in
Frankfurt as much as in Paris. There was strong speculation late last week
that the Bundesbank might lower the repo rate in its weekly money market
intervention on Wednesday, currently at 7.30 per cent.
A Bundesbank council meeting is also due on Thursday. At the start of last
week, it was assumed that the German central bank would leave its interest
rates unchanged at this session, and that the earliest that a cut in
official rates could be expected was July 29.
But, in the wake of recent developments, some dealers are leaning towards
the view that the Bundesbank will have to lower its Lombard rate - and
perhaps even its discount rate - this week if the French currency is to
receive firm underpinning.
Several German economic indicators will hint at whether the Bundesbank will
be able to ease monetary policy. Wholesale prices figures for June are due
out today, with the market expecting a slight rise in inflation. Producer
prices for the same month are also due on Friday.

FT  12 JUL 93 / International Bonds: Swiss tranquillity disturbed by a quiet
revolution
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AMONG European bond markets, few have escaped bouts of currency-related or
politically inspired turbulence over the past year. However, unlike members
of the European exchange rate mechanism, Switzerland's tranquillity has been
disturbed by a quieter revolution taking place in the Swiss franc bond
market.
In recent months, the changes which have taken place in this corner of
Europe - regulations governing the market and the issuance of larger, more
liquid issues - appear to be creating a more enticing market for borrowers
of a sovereign and supranational nature. At the same time, a change in the
economic background has made make it more likely to encourage investors to
buy bonds and for borrowers to launch longer-dated issues.
A recent report by Ms Caroline Shah, an analyst at Standard &amp; Poor's, the
international credit rating agency, points out that the volume of bond
issuance in the Swiss franc bond market has dwindled in recent years, as the
market was 'hampered by slow liberalisation' and left behind as other
countries liberalised their currency markets.
According to figures provided by Euromoney Bondware, the volume of public
and private Swiss franc bonds for foreign issuers declined from a total of
SFr32.7bn in 1990, to SFr 29.9bn in 1991 and SFr27.8bn in 1992. Yet in the
first six months of 1993, the volume of new issues has topped SFr18.5bn,
suggesting the market could be set to exceed the previous year's volume. But
as Ms Shah says, 'recent moves have begun to reverse that trend and . . .
may pave the way for the development of a Swiss franc Euromarket'. She
points out that the Swiss franc market may have benefited from the sporadic
bursts of turbulence in the European exchange rate mechanism.
The following four recent changes should help to lift the growth of the
Swiss franc market:
the abolition of stamp duty on the issue of Swiss franc bonds by non-Swiss
issuers
the abolition of stamp duty on inter-professional trading of foreign bonds,
which had aggravated the illiquidity in the Swiss franc market
the relaxing of syndication requirements, so that banks which are not
domiciled in Switzerland are able to syndicate Swiss franc bonds issued by
foreign borrowers
new issue commissions and associated fees for borrowers have been reduced
and are more evenly distributed.
According to S&amp;P, the relaxation of the stamp duty on foreign issues should
tempt more Swiss franc bond issues from foreign borrowers while the new
syndication rules should help broaden the investor base outside Switzerland.
Yet, the pace of change could be slow. A bond analyst at Pictet, the Swiss
investment house, says: 'The liberalisations are bearing fruit . . . but it
remains a small capital market with very few benchmark issues.'
Some borrowers are taking note of the changing environment. Last month the
Republic of Austria established the benchmark bond in the Swiss franc market
with the launch of its SFr1bn bond due February 2000. The Kingdom of Sweden
also tapped the market last month with a SFr500m 10-year issue, its first
foray in this market since 1988.
Austria's issue is particularly significant given that one of the most
frequent complaints about the Swiss franc market is its poor liquidity. The
market is dominated by Swiss retail investors who, once they have bought the
bonds, tend to hold them to maturity. Small issues of about SFr100-SFr150m
are placed and the liquidity dries up, forcing banks to quote wide bid-offer
spreads thereafter.
Mr Ruedi Zehnder, head of primary markets at Credit Suisse expects Swiss
retail investor appetite for bonds to pick up now that inflation is coming
down and short-term interest rates are declining. The Swiss bond yield curve
has been inverse for the last three years, so while investors could obtain
high returns on bank deposit accounts, there was less incentive to buy
lower-yielding bonds. However, with the fall in short-term rates, the curve
has flattened out, and that appears to be triggering investor interest in
the longer end of the curve.
Another positive factor according to one Swiss banker, is the likelihood
that there will be some early redemptions of bonds with relatively high
coupons this year, which should create investor demand for Swiss franc
bonds.
For borrowers, Swiss interest rates appear relatively low by European
standards, and some borrowers have been able to take advantage of attractive
swap rates.
However, Mr Zehnder is less optimistic about the investor base: 'There is
not a broad demand from outside Switzerland . . . we are changing but not as
quickly as people thought we would change.'

FT  12 JUL 93 / Risk and Reward: Derivatives industry scrambles to find some
kind of infrastructure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE debate in world banking circles over controlling systemic risk from
derivative securities trading will intensify when a study group formed by
the Group of 30, a Washington-based think tank, releases its report on
derivatives later this month.
Such studies are popular. Derivatives, in the span of just a few years, have
become integral to corporate risk management, with a surprising array of
business applications, from swapping long-term debt for short-term debt to
hedging foreign exchange or commodities exposure. Regulators are just coming
to terms with swaps, swaptions, and hybrid instruments, and are wondering
if, and how, such banking exotica should be supervised.
The banks which trade the markets are farther along in managing derivatives.
The industry has evolved to a point where standardised contracts and other
procedures are helping to mitigate credit risks. Now, with the threat of
regulatory intervention pending, the derivatives industry is scrambling to
adopt an infrastructure of sorts, in order to prove that participating
dealers have the growing markets under control.
Estimates of annual over-the-counter derivatives turnover range from Dollars
5,000bn to Dollars 7,000bn in terms of notional face value. However, since
only the income streams from these securities are swapped, the capital at
risk in each trade is smaller than the face value of the securities by at
least a factor of 10.
Ideas for managing credit exposure while at the same time allowing
reasonable market access and a healthy measure of innovation range from a
centralised derivatives clearing house to a more sophisticated generation of
standardised bilateral swaps contracts.
Since credit quality is an important marketing tool for exchange clearing
houses, big banks, and the newly-formed AAA credit-enhanced subsidiaries of
big investment houses, the debate is coloured by the self-interest.
The central clearing house idea has attracted the support of some US banking
regulators. A clearing house would guarantee both sides of a swap and limit
default risk. With the credit quality of counterparties less of an issue, a
central clearing house would, in theory, open up swap market participation
to less highly capitalised banks.
Chicago's two big futures exchanges would like a slice of the swaps clearing
business, and are positioning themselves for a potential bonanza. 'It's
something we're considering,' says Mr Jim Slenz, senior director of risk
management applications for the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
The Chicago Board of Trade is making a bid to clear swaps. Late last month,
it asked its primary regulator, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, to
exempt markets traded only by professionals from the constraints of federal
oversight. Such an exemption, which has been granted to OTC swaps and
off-exchange energy contracts, would allow the CBOT to compete against the
OTC markets with its own non-standardised derivatives. However, it would
also put the exchange in line to clear swaps and hybrid transactions.
The CBOT is a long way from achieving such an exemption. CFTC officials have
opposed mingling the derivatives risks of large institutional traders in the
same clearing house that protects the investments of small retail futures
and options traders.
Mr Andrew Coleman, partner in Price Waterhouse's capital markets area,
believes a separate 'mega clearing-house' for OTC derivatives could be
constructed, but that it would be expensive to establish.
He sees drawbacks: the procedures used to clear, or match, highly
standardised futures trades in liquid exchange markets do not transfer
easily to swaps, which are individually tailored to suit the needs of a
single company and are usually difficult to re-sell.
The handful of specialist dealers trading swaps would prefer to avoid the
expense and standardisation required by a clearing house and negotiate
instead a series of bilateral agreements that reduce exposure in the event a
partner in a swap defaults. Bilateral agreements allow them to preserve the
marketing edge they garner from their AAA credit ratings.

FT  12 JUL 93 / US Money and Credit: Fears over inflation in sharp retreat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE US credit markets are optimistic they are to receive good news on
inflation this week, and that this will underpin the current record low
yields at the long end of the bond market.
A raft of statistics to be released this week will give the markets much
more to chew on than last week, when a lack of fresh economic data and
holiday-shortened working week meant trading lacked a firm direction.
On Tuesday the market brushed off the biggest one-day gain in 13 years in
the widely watched Commodity Research Bureau Index of commodity prices,
which is often regarded as a harbinger of inflation.
For the rise was due mainly to flooding in the Mississippi River valley,
sending grain and other agricultural commodity prices rising sharply, which
economists agreed would have little inflationary consequences.
In thin trading ahead of this week's inflation reports, the price on the
benchmark 30-year long bond managed to make a little progress, with the
yield ending on Friday night at around 6.64 per cent, down from 6.66 per
cent a week earlier.
Wall Street is expecting the overall producer price index for June, which
will be released on Tuesday, to be flat to slightly down, while the consumer
price index, due out on Wednesday, is forecast to be flat overall, with a
0.1 per cent to 0.2 per cent rise in its core rate.
That would mean producer price inflation running roughly at a 2.8 per cent
annual rate since the start of the year, with consumer price inflation at
around 3 per cent - far below the worrying levels recorded in the first four
months of 1993.
Nor are there any significant inflationary clouds on the horizon.
Retail sales figures for June, due out on Wednesday, are expected to show a
modest 0.3 per cent rise, with consumers still nervous about an economic
recovery which seems fragile and growing in fits and starts.
A summary of the May meeting of the Federal Reserve's policy-making Open
Market Committee, released last Friday, confirmed reports that it voted on
that occasion to lean towards raising interest rates if inflation did not
slow down.
The committee met again last week and, while the outcome of its discussions
will not be known for some six weeks, the recent inflation figures should
have made it more sanguine, though probably not sufficiently so to eliminate
its bias towards tightening.
With inflation fears in sharp retreat, international developments may help
underpin the bond market's rally.
Ms Susan Hering, an analyst at Salomon Brothers, points out that a modest
revival in the dollar should increase the attraction of assets denominated
in the US currency, while last week's unexpectedly successful trade talks at
the Tokyo G7 summit 'should dampen fears that increased protectionism will
trigger higher inflation'.
In spite of the bond market's generally buoyant tone, it still has to
overcome an important political hurdle - efforts by the House of
Representatives and the Senate to reach a compromise on their different
versions of President Clinton's deficit reduction package.
Expectations that some compromise package will pass into law have underlain
the market's rally since the start of June.
Many on Wall Street expect the measures will act as a substantial brake on
the economy, and thus on inflation.
A particularly gloomy forecast came last week from Mr Philip Braverman,
chief economist at DKB Securities, who argues that there are early signs of
the US relapsing into recession later this year or in the first half of
1994, and that the Clinton package will accentuate the trend.

FT  12 JUL 93 / Dutch Bonds: Guilder's stability paves the way for 10-year
yields
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR the past 10 years or so the Dutch central bank has managed to maintain
the guilder at virtual parity with the German currency. This policy has
gained so much credibility with the money markets that the Dutch authorities
barely have to lift a finger to get their currency back in line.
It is a situation that the Banque de France, forced to carry out large
intervention at the start of the year when the franc was under heavy
speculative pressure, and possibly facing the prospect again following the
franc's slide last week, might envy.
It is a situation that has enabled the yield on 10-year benchmark Dutch
bonds to be the only one within the European exchange rate mechanism to fall
below the German equivalent for a sustained period.
Even after the enormous shifts of money back into Germany at the end of last
week as international investors finally came to the conclusion that their
pessimism over the outlook for the German economy might be overdone, the
yield on Dutch government bonds of 10 years' maturity is still something
like 10 basis points under the going rate in Germany.
The Netherlands has public borrowing requirement for this year of about Fl
42.4bn, a level which most analysts concede to be in the region best
described as comfortable. The capital funding has gone so well that the
Treasury announced at the beginning of June that it had raised Fl 34.4bn in
the market and there would be no more borrowing in the capital markets until
September.
Many investors see the Netherlands as Germany without the burden of
reunification. German inflation is running at 4.2 per cent compared with 2.1
per cent in the Netherlands.
However, the strong ties between the two countries are working to the
disadvantage of the Netherlands. According to some Dutch economists, there
is little likelihood of 10-year bond yields - one of the strongest
indicators of long-term economic confidence - falling much further below
that in Germany.
The Netherlands needs the market credibility that the link with Germany
provides and, with 30 per cent of its exports going to Germany, it is
inextricably tied to its neighbour.
Mr Arno Barens, European economist with F. Van Lanschot Bankiers, the Dutch
commercial bank, believes: 'The spread will reach parity by the end of the
year; not so much because of the good performance of the German economy but
more because of the close link between the two and the arbitrage
opportunities that provides.'
The Dutch central bank has been paring its short-term rates in order to
maintain currency parity and although its floor rate, the official advances
rate, is at 6.5 per cent against the German discount rate of 6.75 per cent,
the 'special advances rate', which is used as a fine tuning, mechanism is
only just below at 6.7 per cent.
As Ms Ellen van der Gulik of the new Dutch merchant bank Mees Pierson says:
'The markets realise that if you push the guilder up too much the central
bank will punish them. Even if the whole ERM blew up and Germany had to get
out the Netherlands would still stay with it.'

FT  12 JUL 93 / UK Gilts: Prices climb despite lure of German bonds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK inflation optimists remain in the ascendancy. Gilt prices continued
to climb last week in spite of the competing attractions of German
government bonds which soared as investors re-appraised the outlook for the
German economy and the D-Mark.
Ten-year gilts gained nearly a quarter of a point on the week, after a half
point rise the week before.
Little happened to change the consensus view that inflationary pressures
would be muted for some time.
That sentiment could be tested this week, which sees a spate of economic
data including the latest numbers for unemployment and retail price
inflation.
Even though senior officials at the Bank of England continue to sound
warnings about the possibility of increased price pressures in the next few
months, the balance of opinion in financial markets is shifting towards
commentators such as Professor Patrick Minford of Liverpool University who
are claiming that inflation is dead.
According to Prof Minford, one of the Treasury's panel of seven outside
economic advisers whose second report came out last week, recent changes in
company behaviour and in the labour market have made the re-appearance of
serious inflationary problems in the near future extremely unlikely.
He says he is 'frustrated and depressed' that much of the mainstream UK
economics community tends more to the official Bank line on inflation.
According to Prof Minford, the UK economy is 'straining at the leash' and
could be capable of strong non-inflationary growth this year if the
government were to loosen economic policy.
This could be done, he says, by a cut of 2 percentage points in interest
rates by the end of the year to 4 per cent.
He also would like the Treasury and Bank to combat the generally upward
drift by sterling.
Even though few in the gilts market are quite so sanguine about price
pressures in the economy as the Liverpool professor, the broad direction of
yield movements during the week lend his views some support.
The yield of the 8 per cent Treasury bond maturing in 2003 was quoted on
Friday night at 7.51 per cent, 13 basis points down on the week and 50 basis
points down over the past month.
It closed on Friday at a price of 103 5/16.
The 10-year area of the gilt curve performed particularly well last week,
with some selling at the short end as investors reckoned they might have
over-reacted the week before to the possibility of a cut in UK base rates in
the near future.
In generally quiet trading due to the absence of any significant UK economic
data, gilts were largely unaffected by the strong move into German bunds
during the week.
One gilts specialist said: 'It reflects the strong support for gilts,
particularly from non-UK institutions which see the securities as cheap.'
Other strong buyers of gilts in recent weeks have included UK insurance
companies, unit trusts and investment groups. Pension funds have been among
the least enthusiastic buyers of the bonds.
Among the other members of the Treasury's economic panel, Mr Gavyn Davies of
Goldman Sachs is less optimistic than Prof Minford about inflation. He is
keen in particular to draw attention to the effects of the tax increases
planned for next April which will push up prices for some goods and
services.
Mr Davies reckons the government's favoured measure of underlying inflation
 -the year-on-year change in the retail prices index excluding mortgage
payments - will push up close to the 4 per cent Treasury ceiling by the end
of 1994.
In the year to last month, this measure of underlying inflation is thought
likely to move to 3 per cent, from 2.8 per cent in the year to May.
The exact figure will be announced by the Central Statistical Office on
Wednesday. The headline inflation rate - the retail price index by itself -
is thought likely to come in at 1.5 per cent, after 1.3 per cent in the
previous month.
Attention will also focus on the change in unemployment last month, which is
reckoned to have shown a generally flat trend after the surprise of four
successive monthly drops in the jobless figure.

FT  12 JUL 93 / International Company News: Akai loss widens to Y941m at
half-way

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AKAI Electric, the Japanese maker of video and audio equipment, suffered a
pre-tax loss of Y941m (Dollars 8.8m) in the half-year ended May 20,
reflecting the continuing sluggish state of the consumer electronics market.
The loss, significantly larger than the Y623m deficit of the same period a
year ago, came on sales of Y25bn, an increase of 2.2 per cent on the
previous first half.
Sluggish sales of video cassette recorders, particularly in Europe where
Akai has a strong foothold, the impact of the yen's rise and increased
competition were blamed for the disappointing performance. Akai has an
export ratio of 85 per cent and increased sales in all regions except Europe
where they fell by 13 per cent.
Video equipment suffered a 4 per cent decline in sales while audio equipment
saw sales grew by 27 per cent.
Akai forecast pre-tax losses would increase sharply in the year to November
20 because of the depressed market conditions and the yen's rise against the
dollar this year.
It expects losses of Y1.3bn, compared with the previous Y247m. This will be
the second straight year of losses for Akai, which had initially expected to
post a pre-tax profit of Y200m in the current year.
The group hopes to combat the impact of the yen's rise with price rises, an
increase in overseas production and in the procurement of parts from
overseas. However, it believes sales of VCRs will continue to decline
through the year.

FT  12 JUL 93 / International Company News: Alcoa drops 21% as aluminium
prices decline
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ALUMINUM Company of America, the world's biggest aluminium producer, has
reported a 21 per cent drop in second-quarter net income before special
charges.
The figures come against a backdrop of high world aluminium stocks and low
prices, due to a a large increase of imports to the West from the former
Soviet Union.
At the end of last month, Mr Paul O'Neill, chairman of Alcoa, announced that
the company was cutting its annual primary production in the US by almost 25
per cent, and laying off 750 people.
The second-quarter figures, released on Friday, showed earnings of Dollars
44.7m, or 51 cents a share, before Dollars 9.4m of net unfavourable
adjustments. Sales and operating revenues were little changed at Dollars
2.4bn.
The adjustments included a special charge of Dollars 23.8m after tax for job
cuts; a charge of Dollars 11.9m for a new three-year labour agreement; and a
Dollars 26.3m Australian tax credit.
In the second quarter of last year the company reported earnings of Dollars
56.5m, or 65 cents a share, be-fore charges of Dollars 104.7m.
The company said prices on most products had declined from the same quarter
of last year.
Revenues were level, in spite of a 5 per cent decline in aluminium
shipments, because of increased sales in non-aluminium products.
For the first six months of the year Alcoa reported net income of Dollars
72.3m, or 82 cents a share, before adjustments, compared to Dollars 111.6m,
or Dollars 1.29 a share, on the same basis in 1992.

<TEXT>
ARGENTINA has completed the privatisation of its principal energy companies
with the sale of Hidronor, the country's principal hydroelectricity
generator for Dollars 1.11bn.
The sale follows last month's successful flotation of YPF, the national oil
company, and last year's privatisation of the federally-held gas and
electricity companies. In just 15 months, Argentina's energy privatisations
have raised more than Dollars 6.65bn.
The government split Hidronor into three parts, selling each as a separate
unit. Three international consortia paid Dollars 474.6m in cash and took on
a further Dollars 631.1m in financial liabilities from the government.
Hidronor's dams have been transferred as 30-year concessions.
The sale last week of El Chocon, the largest of the dams, for Dollars 519.3m
to a consortium led by Endesa of Chile, was particularly significant.
Argentina and Chile have long been fierce rivals.
El Chocon is located close to the Chilean border in the southern Andes and
is a large source of electricity for Argentina. Last year, Endesa acquired
generating and distribution companies in greater Buenos Aires.
A consortium headed by Southern Electric of the US paid Dollars 393.5m for
the Alicura dam. Another consortium comprising Dominion Energy, also of the
US, and Louis Dreyfus, the international commodity trader, paid Dollars
192.9m for the smaller Cerros Colorados dam.

disposals

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE troubled business empire controlled by Toronto's Bronfman family is
making further disposals, selling its controlling interest in Consumers
Packaging, Canada's biggest glass container maker, as well as a 50 per cent
stake in a British Columbia paper mill.
Consolidated Enfield, a Bronfman-controlled company, will receive CDollars
9.7m (USDollars 7.5m) for its 58 per cent stake in Consumers from the owners
of Glenshaw Glass, a privately-held US glass maker based in Pittsburgh.
Glenshaw has agreed to invest an unspecified amount in Consumers and to keep
all its seven plants in operation.
Separately, Noranda Forest, which is also controlled by the Bronfmans, has
sold its 50 per cent stake in Island Paper Mills, which makes coated and
uncoated papers, to EB Eddy, a Canadian forest products group.
Eddy has bought the remaining 50 per cent from MacMillan Bloedel of
Vancouver. Terms were not disclosed.
The purchase price for Consumers of 65 cents a share is less than half the
current market price, and reflects the company's fragile financial
condition.
Losses over the past five years have totalled CDollars 229m, and Consumers
is in default on a considerable portion of its bank debt and debentures. It
is in the middle of a financial and business restructuring, which included
the sale earlier this year of its plastics packaging interests.
Mr Brian Lawson, Enfield's president, said a fresh owner 'committed to
injecting new capital and providing strategic support' greatly improves
Consumers prospects. The company has a market share of roughly 70 per cent,
with 1992 sales of CDollars 410m.
Consumers and Island Paper are the latest in a string of asset disposals by
companies in the Bronfman orbit. Others sold this year include controlling
interests in MacMillan Bloedel, the west coast forestry group; John Labatt,
the beer and entertainment group; and Royal Trust, Canada's second-biggest
trust and loan company.
The convoluted structure of the Bronfman group, which includes several
private holding companies, makes it hard for outsiders to estimate the
extent of its financial difficulties which led to the spate of asset sales.

SWISSAIR has sold six of its 23 MD-81 aircraft on very favourable terms, Mr
Otto Loepfe, the Swiss national airline's chief executive, said yesterday.
No figures were given. Swissair is frequently in the used aircraft market
and aims to keep a modern fleet. In the past two years, proceeds from sales
have prevented the airline from making losses.
Mr Loepfe, speaking to the airline's annual managers' meeting in Zurich,
said the Alcazar project, under which Swissair would join forces with KLM
Royal Dutch Airlines, Scandinavian Airlines System and Austrian Airlines,
was the best way forward for the company. It said a memorandum of agreement
was expected to be signed by the airlines in September.
If the deal goes ahead, the four carriers would shed 10 per cent of their
workforces, Mr Loepfe said. This would require Swissair to make some of its
25,800 staff redundant, but the workforce was falling by 5.3 per cent
annually through natural attrition.

FT  12 JUL 93 / International Company News: Swiss banks lifted by first-half
improvements
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FIRST-HALF results from three medium-sized Swiss banks underpin expectations
of a banner year in prospect for the industry.
BZ Bank, the Zurich securities house headed by Mr Martin Ebner, reports
first-half net income of SFr49.9m (Dollars 35.6m), not far from the SFr59.5m
earned in the whole of last year.
It was the first time BZ, which is privately held, reported interim results
and no comparative figures were given.
Last week, Banca del Gottardo, the Lugano based bank controlled by Japan's
Sumitomo Bank, said cash flow rose 22 per cent to SFr61.4m in the first
half.
While two weeks ago, Julius Baer, another Zurich banking group, said its
first-half net profit was about SFr70m, slightly higher than the figure for
the whole of last year.
Lower interest rates, a buoyant local stock market, big new inflows of
investment funds and controlled costs are the factors contributing to these
results.
The Swiss stock market's all-share index is up 22 per cent since the
beginning of the year, enabling banks to make large gains in trading and
commission income.
Baer said its trading income more than doubled in the first half, Gottardo
said stock trading and new issue commission income was up 30 per cent while
BZ's securities related income, at SFr50.9m, was 28 per cent above the
figure for the whole of last year.
Baer, which specialises in asset management, said its commission income from
this business was up 20 per cent. Also, clients' assets grew by about 10 per
cent in the first six months and total SFr36bn.
Analysts said funds had been pouring into Switzerland this year, partly
because of continuing turbulence in exchange rates in other European
countries.
Mr Bernhard Tschanz, head of investment research at Credit Suisse, said
Switzerland's decision last December to stay out of the European Economic
Area helped.
Baer's net interest income gained 10 per cent, reflecting widening spreads
as interest rates fell.
The big three Swiss universal banks, Union Bank of Switzerland, Swiss Bank
Corporation and Credit Suisse, are the main beneficiaries of this trend, and
they are all expected to report sharply higher first-half profits.

FT  12 JUL 93 / International Company News: 10% of ITV companies held by US
institutions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
US fund managers hold stakes totalling about 10 per cent in the ITV
companies, according to a new survey of who owns what in the UK's commercial
television sector.
The biggest institutional investor is Chase Manhattan with significant
stakes in Central, London Weekend Television and Scottish.
Fidelity is the second largest US holder in ITV, owning stakes equal to more
than 3 per cent of the stand-alone ITV companies.
Another leading US investors is Warburg Pincus with an 8.31 per cent stake
in LWT.
The extent of the US involvement is detailed in Citywatch, a new sharewatch
service launched by Investor Communications &amp; Research, part of London-based
consultants GAH.
The Citywatch survey of institutional ownership in the ITV sector is the
latest to be produced by GAH. The consultants have already researched areas
such as the food, retailing and stores sectors.
Among UK institutional investors, Mercury Asset Management is by far the
largest with stakes equalling a total of 8.69 per cent of the stand alone
companies. It is strong in the companies which would be the main takeover
targets if present rules are relaxed - Central, LWT, Scottish and Anglia.
Prudential Portfolio Managers, the sector's second largest investor, is
backing a similar range of companies.
Phillips &amp; Drew Fund Management is also a significant player, but its
largest investment is in HTV - a 23.04 per cent stake.
The BBC pension fund is also an investor in ITV, holding a 3.83 per cent
stake in Anglia Television.
Mr James Redhead, of GAH, said he saw the research as 'a key defence tool'
for ITV companies trying to ward off unwelcome predators.
'It is also going to be of great value to foreign predators,' he said.

FT  12 JUL 93 / International Company News: Europa poised to move back into
the black
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPA MINERALS, the UK mining finance house which has been refinanced and
restructured, broke even in the opening quarter.
And it will return to pre-tax profit for the first time since 1989 in the
half year to July 30, said Sir David Hardy, chairman, at the annual meeting.
He would not forecast the full-year result and said Europa, which has gold
and coal mining interests in Australia as well as drawing royalties from
North Sea and Indonesian oil, had a long way to go before paying dividends.
Sir David confirmed that consideration was being given to a three-sided
restructuring to pull together Europa and Austmin, the small Australian
mining company which is Europa's main shareholder with 19.8 per cent, and
Burmine, the Australian gold producer of which Europa holds 41.8 per cent.
This would result in a group with a market capital of about ADollars 40m,
quoted and with interests primarily in Australia but also with a London
listing. This would 'make it more simple for shareholders to see what they
own.'
But Sir David stressed that any restructuring would be very complex to work
out, and was 'an idea being explored, no more than that.'
An 8 per cent stake in Europa, left with Australian sub-underwriters after a
poorly-received rights issue of shares a year ago, was acquired recently by
Mt Edon, another small Australian gold group backed by Swiss money.
Henry Ansbacher, the merchant bank which underwrote the issue, was left with
12.8 per cent of Europa. Mr Edward Schneider of Ansbacher said it was being
treated as a long-term investment.

FT  12 JUL 93 / International Company News: New outlets help Pelican rise to
Pounds 908,000
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PELICAN Group of restaurants doubled pre-tax profits from Pounds 453,000
to Pounds 908,000 in the year to end-March, helped by the opening of eight
new outlets.
Turnover rose to Pounds 8.08m (Pounds 6.32m), bolstered by the continued
expansion of the Cafe Rouge chain, which now comprises a total of 14 open
and two in development.
The group now operated 20 restaurants. Mr Roger Myers, chairman, said: 'The
Rouge concept still has great scope for expansion throughout the UK and we
are actively looking for new sites.' Last year saw rapid growth, with
turnover, profit and overall development all reaching record levels.
Since the year-end Pelican had purchased the Yankee Noodle group of
restaurants which brought with them Mr Robert Earl, who is behind the Planet
Hollywood chain, as a non-executive director. At the same time the group
raised Pounds 4m in a placing with clawback, for working capital and to
clear gearing.
The Leadenhall Wine Bar and the Cafe Pelican made a reduced contribution
because of the recession.
Interest payments fell to Pounds 345,000 (Pounds 409,000) reflecting the
drop in UK interest rates. The dividend is increased to 1.1p (1p) out of
earnings per share of 4p (3p).

FT  12 JUL 93 / International Company News: Gieves placing and open offer to
raise Pounds 1.8m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
HAVING BREACHED covenants on convertible loan stock and borrowing
restrictions, Gieves Group is raising Pounds 1.8m net in a placing and open
offer to remedy the situation.
The group, now operating as retailers and licensors and publishers, is
placing 8.2m shares with USI Holdings group, which speaks for 5.1 per cent
of the capital and all of the loan stock, and with Thistle Nominees on
behalf of Mr George Ljutikov, a private investor holding 9.9 per cent of the
capital.
Shareholders can claw back on the basis of 3-for-5 at 25p per share. USI
will not request the immediate repayment of the loan stock in return for
certain adjustments to the terms.
At the end of the year to January 31 1993 the loss retained in the business
had risen from Pounds 3.8m to Pounds 4.75m. For the 12 months pre-tax
deficit came to Pounds 1.41m (Pounds 1.51m), including exceptional charges
of Pounds 1.34m (Pounds 1.71m).
The exceptionals were made up of Pounds 810,000 for the closure of the
Gieves &amp; Hawkes operation in Milan and two retail outlets in the UK, Pounds
471,000 for restructuring and reorganisation costs for Chivers' publishing
divisions in the UK and US, and Pounds 63,000 for net property liabilities.
On top of that were extraordinary charges of Pounds 3.47m (Pounds 2.28m).
These comprised Pounds 1.78m adjustment for goodwill previously written off
against reserves, Pounds 998,000 provisions and asset write-offs principally
for the Milan stores, Pounds 815,000 profit on the sale of Bookpoint, and
Pounds 1.5m in respect of the crystallisation of contingent liabilities
relating to Redwood Press.
In respect of the latter, the principal guaranteed parties have
conditionally agreed to subscribe for 900,000 shares at 25p in part
settlement of the amounts owed.

FT  12 JUL 93 / International Company News: Final Cray bonus tranche likely
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FINAL tranche of a share-option based incentive bonus package, worth in
total between Pounds 25m and Pounds 35m, for the former chairman and three
senior directors of Cray Electronics, is likely to be triggered tomorrow
when the group announces its 1992-93 results.
The complex three-part bonus package was approved by Cray shareholders in
December 1989 when a new management team led by Sir Peter Michael, the
former chairman of UEI, was installed after the company was widely
criticised for its accounting policies and forced to revise its profits
downwards.
The four beneficiaries of the scheme are Sir Peter, who stepped down as
chairman at the start of last month, his successor, Mr Roger Holland, Mr
Jeff Harrison, finance director, and Mr Jon Richards, group managing
director.
Under the terms of the scheme, devised by SG Warburg, Cray's financial
adviser, the four executives were entitled to subscribe for cut-price
deferred convertible shares and deferred redeemable shares, depending on the
group's share price and its financial performance measured by earnings per
share.
The share price has risen sharply over 12 months, closing at 161p on Friday,
and results, boosted by disposals and timely acquisitions, have bounced back
from a Pounds 2.79m pre-tax loss in 1989-90 to pre-tax profit of Pounds 3.5m
in 1991-92.
As a result the pre-conditions triggering the first two tranches of the
incentive scheme have already been met. The size and value of the third
tranche of share options depends upon the level of earnings in the year to
April 30, and the share price at the time of conversion.
The potential value of the share option incentive scheme raised some
eyebrows at the time - one analyst said he was staggered by its size.
However it was defended by Sir Peter who said the incentive was 'fair for a
very difficult job,' given the risks.

companies

<TEXT>
BANNER HOMES, the USM-quoted property trading and development group, is
acquiring two BES housebuilding companies, Housebuilding Portfolio One and
Housebuilding Portfolio Two, which it launched in 1990. Banner owns 10.7 per
cent of their share capital and has managed them from inception.
Banner has also announced pre-tax profits of Pounds 255,000 for the year to
March 31, compared with losses of Pounds 688,000. Turnover was slightly
lower at Pounds 6.63m (Pounds 6.83m).
Had the two companies been part of the group as at March 31, they would have
increased turnover by about 30 per cent. Their combined sales for the year
were Pounds 1.81m and pre-tax profits Pounds 33,000. Net assets at March 31
amounted to Pounds 739,000.
Earnings per share came through at 2p (losses 3.9p).

FT  12 JUL 93 / International Company News: Cliveden to seek public listing
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CLIVEDEN Group, which runs the Buckinghamshire country house as a hotel,
(pictured above), is to seek a public listing after reversing into Ifico, a
former insurance broker. The house and gardens were donated by the Astor
family to the National Trust in 1942. Granted an 80-year lease by the NT,
the Cliveden Group have spent some Pounds 12m refurbishing the house. The
company achieved a 66.8 per cent occupancy rate and Pounds 207 a night
average charge on the 31 bedrooms in the financial year to last October. It
made an operating profit of Pounds 427,000 on turnover of Pounds 3.83m but
reported a retained loss of Pounds 456,000. Ifico, which became a shell
company after selling its insurance broking businesses in 1991, hopes to
regain its listing once the transaction has been completed.

FT  12 JUL 93 / German duo dances to different tunes: Christopher Parkes and
Alan Cane examine the reasons for Siemens' tribulations in computers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES and ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When giants learn to dance, a little flat-footedness is to be expected. But
Siemens, Germany's leading electrical and electronics group, seems not to be
an especially apt pupil.
It fell over its own feet with the 1989 acquisition of Rolm from IBM. It
took almost four years to integrate it with its private telecommunications
business because someone underestimated the fundamental differences between
US and German telephone systems.
The judges are waiting watchfully to see how it copes with another
transatlantic two-step. Siemens, seeking a partner for its Osram lighting
subsidiary, paid GTE DM1bn last year for its North American Sylvania
operation. Since Osram is Europe's number two lamp maker after Philips,
buying continental Sylvania was ruled out on competition grounds.
Although no calamities are expected, critics wonder how fitting a pair the
businesses make when, for example, vehicle lamp specifications vary so
greatly between Europe and the US.
For the moment, however, the main problem preoccupying Mr Heinrich von
Pierer, the new Siemens chairman, is the lumbering performance of Siemens
Nixdorf Informationssysteme (SNI), an ill-matched merger arranged by
Deutsche Bank in 1990.
The industrial logic appeared plain enough. Steady, tradition-based Siemens
had 20 per cent of the German market for mainframe machines and made modest
profits on equipment supplied mostly by Fujitsu of Japan. Live-wire,
entrepreneurial Nixdorf had flourished in the 1980s, winning 25 per cent of
the home market for its mini-computers. It also came equipped with a strong
software business.
Together, according to Deutsche Bank thinking, Germany had its own
DM8bn-a-year internationally competitive computer industry combining the
best of old and new, safe in the arms of one of the country's most stable
industrial concerns.
Last week, almost three years after the merger, Mr von Pierer said he
expected SNI's losses this year to match last year's deficit of DM513m
(Pounds 202m). This will bring the cumulative loss since the company was
formed to almost DM2bn. Unit personal computer sales had increased 50 per
cent, he said, but price wars and currency losses had cost an estimated
DM1bn.
The roots of SNI's difficulties lie in its dependence on hardware sales and
the changed relationship between costs and revenues.
The gross profit on a mainframe used to be as much as 90 per cent, ample to
pay for expensive sales forces and elaborate customer support, and still
yield a worthwhile profit. Today the gross return is 60 per cent and
falling. The comparable figure for mini-computers may be less than 40 per
cent and below 20 per cent for PCs. Meanwhile, customers are turning away
from mainframes and minis in favour of networks of PCs, which are more
flexible and cheaper.
The first indications of these problems were apparent when SNI came into
being. In its last year of independence, Nixdorf, having built up its
workforce to almost 30,000 in the expectation of continued growth, lost
DM1bn on sales of DM5.6bn as the boom petered out.
Recession, striking hard at mainframe sales, together with structural change
in the industry and its markets, further compounded SNI's difficulties
It was only later, when orders went unbooked, sales went unbilled and losses
grew, that Siemens came to appreciate that the new partners were dancing
different steps to different tunes. The Siemens side chose to lead. The
Nixdorf team, unaccustomed to sluggish bureaucracies, found its
entrepreneurial spirit being squeezed out.
The fledgling SNI, already trying to adapt to change in the industry and to
recession, was being riven internally by a clash of cultures.
Morale suffered as the parent applied rough and ready remedies to staunch
the profits drain. Already cut to around 47,000 from 52,000 at the time of
the merger, the workforce is scheduled to drop to less than 40,000 by the
end of 1995.
Only latterly has internal structural change come to the fore. Last October,
for example, the PC business was split, according to the current fashion,
into three business units. PCs, high performance printers and systems
integration are now separate profit centres. In April the process of
subdivision was extended throughout the concern with the creation of four
units responsible for products, and six more in charge of internal and
external services - from procurement to maintenance.
'When I look at what has been achieved in the last few months alone, I am
convinced we'll bring about a turnaround,' said a confident Mr von Pierer.
Changes at SNI embody his view of the main sources of future strength for
the group. His predecessor, Mr Karl-Heinz Kaske, who enlarged Siemens by
acquisition, finally broke the monolith into 17 operating divisions
encompassing 300 activities. Within this frame, Mr von Pierer aims to create
a network of individual profit centres, fostering the entrepreneurial spirit
as he goes.
He expects SNI to be profitable within three years, when it will be ready
for its next important development: a partner. His computer business may be
relatively strong in Germany, but it has less than 2 per cent of the
DM14bn-a-year European PC market, only marginally more of the DM7.5bn
systems integration business and around 13 per cent of the DM6bn
medium-sized Unix computer market.
Long-term supplier Fujitsu, the Japanese mainframe specialist, with which
SNI recently extended its links, is the name which crops up most often.
Since Mr von Pierer insists that any relationship should be on equal terms,
much depends on the success of the restructuring - and the speed at which
recession unwinds - in restoring SNI to profit. Although he repeats with
rising fervour that computers and information technology have a core role in
the group, if the return to the black is too long delayed, even he may come
to agree with the critics who say Siemens would dance far better with one
less leg.

FT  12 JUL 93 / Debt talks set to resume at O&amp;Y USA

<TEXT>
OLYMPIA &amp; York USA is close to resuming debt-relief talks with creditors
after reaching agreement on a number of disputes relating to it's board of
directors and other issues of corporate governance.
Negotiations to restructure O&amp;Y USA's USDollars 5.3bn debt have been at a
standstill since March following disagreements between the company and its
Canadian parent, Olympia &amp; York Developments (OYDL).
The Reichmann family, which retained a 20 per cent interest in O&amp;Y USA in
the restructuring of OYDL earlier this year, also raised concerns about the
possible dilution of their stake.
According to a lawyer involved in the case, some minor points of
disagreement remain between the Reichmanns and O&amp;Y USA. But these are
expected to be cleared up early this week in time for a New York bankruptcy
court judge to grant an order next Thursday approving the new arrangements.
The debt-restructuring talks are expected to drag on for at least six
months,and perhaps much longer. But the corporate-governance pact has raised
hopes the talks will succeed without O&amp;Y USA following its parent into
bankruptcy protection.
The agreement, which was hammered out under the auspices of former US
secretary of state Mr Cyrus Vance, gives O&amp;Y USA substantial autonomy from
OYDL, which is now under the control of a court-appointed administrator.
A new nine-person board will include a group of seven independent directors,
whose stature would be the envy of most companies. They include Mr Willard
Butcher, former president of Chase Manhattan Bank; Mr John Whitehead,
co-chairman of Goldman Sachs and a former US deputy-secretary of state; Mr
Richard Ravitch, a prominent New Yorker who once headed the city's
transportation authority; and Mr William Davis, former premier of Ontario.
A source close to O&amp;Y said that most of the new directors have accepted
their position as a public service in the interests of the New York real
estate market. O&amp;Y USA is the city's biggest office landlord and the single
largest contributor of commercial property taxes. Its collapse would have a
chilling effect on the entire market.

FT  12 JUL 93 / Merck president resigns unexpectedly
</HEADLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Richard Markham, president of Merck &amp; Company, the world's largest
prescription drugs group, has resigned unexpectedly after seven months in
the post.
The 42-year-old Mr Markham, who was also Merck's chief operating officer,
was widely viewed as heir apparent to the company's chairman, Mr Roy
Vagelos.
Merck said Mr Markham had left for 'personal reasons' which he did not wish
to spell out.
Mr Vagelos said: 'While Mr Markham's departure is disappointing, one of
Merck's strengths is the quality and depth of its management team.' Those
executives who reported directly to Mr Markham will now report to Mr
Vagelos.
The upheaval at Merck follows the ousting in March of Dr Ernest Mario as
chief executive and deputy chairman of Glaxo, Europe's largest drugs
company, after apparent disagreements over management style and strategy.
The Merck announcement surprised Wall Street analysts who suggested there
was nothing in the company's recent financial performance to account for Mr
Markham's departure.
Mr Markham had spent more than two decades at Merck, becoming senior
vice-president for Europe in 1989 and taking charge of the company's human
health business worldwide in 1991.
The New Jersey-based company's share price has fallen sharply this year from
the high Dollars 40s to close unchanged at Dollars 34 3/4 last Friday. The
resignation announcement came after the market's close and Merck shares may
drop in reaction to the news this morning.
Analysts have been cutting their earnings forecasts for the company in
recent weeks amid concern that it will be unable to sustain its strong
growth record.
The concerns are due partly to pressures from the Clinton administration for
the drug industry to cut prices and partly to doubts about the market
potential of one of its new products, Proscar, a treatment for enlarged
prostates.
Merck, best known for anti-hypertensive and cardiovascular drugs, reported
net profits of Dollars 1.98bn, (Pounds 1.32bn) or Dollars 2.12 a share for
1992, on sales of Dollars 9.7bn. Fourth quarter earnings rose 17 per cent on
sales up 12 per cent.
Mr Markham is the second top executive of a major US drugs company to quit
in the past few weeks. In late June, Mr Vaughn Bryson resigned as head of
Eli Lilly after boardroom disputes.

FT  12 JUL 93 / Institutions bullish on outlook for UK equities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A LARGE majority of institutional investors are more positive on UK equities
over the next 12 months than on any other market, according to a survey
published today.
The monthly Smith New Court/Gallup poll of fund managers found 84 per cent
were bullish over the outlook for UK equities compared with 67 per cent for
Japan, 55 per cent for continental Europe and only 9 per cent for the US.
The finding reinforces other recent reports and comes on top of a gathering
momentum for a reduction in domestic interest rates. The London stock market
firmed on Friday as rumours of an imminent cut were boosted by four of the
City's leading broking firms' reducing their year-end forecasts. BZW, James
Capel and SG Warburg moved from 6 to 5 per cent, with SG Strauss Turnbull
also trimming its figures.
However, market strategists did strike one note of caution last week as
suspicions grew that some of the big institutions were beginning to move
funds out of London and into Germany in anticipation of a cut in German
rates as part of a support package for the Franc.
However, many fund managers remain nervous about the pace of recovery in the
UK economy, with only 17 per cent of respondents believing the general
economic situation would improve over the next 12 months, down from 24 per
cent in June and 35 per cent in May.

FT  12 JUL 93 / Economics Notebook: A test of faith in the UK's recovery
creed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the last few weeks a malaise has settled over the UK financial markets.
Anxiety is growing that even the cautious faith in a sustainable recovery
expressed by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the new Chancellor, may be too optimistic.
The fear among a number of economists and investors is that the promising
indicators of the first quarter reflected a one-off boost from sterling's
devaluation and lower interest rates rather than a sustained improvement in
the economy.
Even if the UK does not drift back into recession, expectations are mounting
that once the optimism of the spring dies down, there will be little
recovery left to speak of.
The unease has been picked up in the UK money markets. The December sterling
futures contract is pricing in another base rate cut by the end of the year,
and it is harder to find City economists supporting the view that interest
rates have hit bottom at 6 per cent than it was a few months ago.
Last week, SG Warburg Securities, which for some time has been relatively
bullish about growth, joined the crowd in forecasting that the Chancellor
was likely to cut rates to 5 per cent by the end of the year.
Mr Peter Warburton, chief economist at Robert Fleming, sums up the general
concern: 'The buoyancy of consumer purchases of cars, household goods and
leisure items in the first quarter bears the hallmarks of a temporary
spending binge rather than the beginning of a sustained trend.'
What, then, lay behind the strong growth of the first three months of the
year if it did not reflect a solid, underlying improvement? Mr Bill Martin,
economist at UBS, says there was a one-off surge in consumption provoked by
keen high street pricing and better terms on hire purchase agreements after
the interest rate cut. Stock-building may also have provided a short-term
boost to output and there was an upsurge in confidence after the rate cut.
But these factors will not be enough to sustain the sparkle of the first
quarter through the rest of the year, say the gloomier economists.
In a recent report, Professor Wynne Godley, one of the Treasury's outside
advisers known as the seven wise men, says: 'With a severe recession
developing in Europe and with inadequate capacity in tradeable goods and
services, the growth of net export demand over the next few years will not,
on present policies, be any faster in the future than in the past.' The
upshot, he says, is that 'it will not be possible to achieve sustainable
growth fast enough to reduce unemployment by any significant amount over the
next four or five years.'
The worries of Prof Godley and economists such as Mr Martin focus on:
The overhang of debt. Professor Godley believes that with household debt
still around 100 per cent of the annual flow of disposable income, personal
saving is likely to stay very high.
Survey evidence backs up the fear that consumer spending remains constrained
by deteriorating personal finances. Last week, the consultancy Business
Strategies Limited reported a rise in the proportion of people falling into
debt, particularly in the south-east.
On the corporate side, the big overhang of excess capacity in many sectors,
together with weakened balance sheets, is checking investment. Tax increases
next year and a squeeze on real disposable income. Even the more bullish
economists fear that next April's tax increases will sharply reduce consumer
spending.
Mr David Smith, economist at Williams de Broe, expects growth to be buoyant
this year, but warns: 'I am much more concerned that next year will be very
disappointing because of the tax increases.' He adds that the prospect of
further tax rises will dwell at the back of people's minds so long as the
budget deficit remains as high as it is.
Meanwhile, consumers face a squeeze on real incomes as the rise in average
earnings continues to slow.
European recession. Sluggish growth in Europe has been singled out by the
Organisation for Co-operation and Development as a significant drag on
growth in the UK. Even the competitive gains of devaluation may not be
enough to sustain exports as the UK's main markets slide into recession.
Credit controls. Professor Godley points out that in previous recoveries
there has been some sort of relaxation of credit regulations which has given
an underlying boost to demand. This recovery will not benefit from such a
move and caution among banks will act as a further hindrance to recovery.
Not everyone is as gloomy about medium-term prospects. Mr Tim Congdon,
another of the seven wise men, says in the Treasury report: 'It is already
clear that the main macroeconomic figures for this year will be the best
since the late 1980s.'
He says bright economic prospects can be explained by the large amount of
excess capacity as a result of reduced output during the recession. This, he
argues, will allow for strong non-inflationary growth.
Other City economists take a similarly bullish view. 'A lot of the negative
factors can be off-set by the lower exchange rate and lower interest rates
and there is a feeling that we are near the trough in Europe anyway,' says
Mr Paul Turnbull, at Smith New Court.
The economy is now poised between sliding back into unspectacular growth or
continuing with the gains already made this year.
If the economic figures expected over the next two weeks are bad, the
chancellor may be tempted to cut interest rates again. But he will need to
keep an eye on the level of the pound. Since its recent rise partly reflects
optimism about the UK recovery, a run of weaker figures may push the
currency back down. In this case, Mr Clarke will have to decide whether to
cut interest rates while the pound is weak, or whether to cling to base
rates of 6 per cent in the hope that conditions for a strong upturn really
are already in place.

FT  12 JUL 93 / EC funds may pave way for farm deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GERMANY has suggested chan-nelling European Community funds to French
farmers to win France's support for an agreement cutting farm subsidies in
the Uruguay Round of trade liberalisation talks.
The suggestion came ahead of today's resumption of the long dormant Uruguay
Round talks in Geneva, at which negotiators from the Quad countries - the
US, the EC, Japan and Canada - will brief trading partners on their
tariff-cutting deal reached at last week's Group of Seven summit in Tokyo.
Mr Gunter Rexrodt, the German economics minister, said at the Tokyo meeting
that financial concessions could play an important role in winning 'one
European Community partner' for an agreement on agricultural trade.
The German minister did not name France in his remarks to journalists.
However, French objections are holding up an EC-US agreement on reducing
subsidies in agricultural trade that could form the basis of further
international negotiations under the auspices of the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade.
Mr Rexrodt said he considered that farm trade problems would prove to be the
'sticking point' in reaching a final pact on global trade liberalisation.
He believed that problems of agricultural trade could be dealt with through
a financial agreement that would enable 'an EC partner country' to overcome
structural and regional problems more easily than at present.
He admitted there would be less money available for other EC countries if
Community funds were used to compensate farmers in one state for losses
arising from a deal on farm trade.
Mr Rexrodt stressed that he was close to the Gatt talks, partly because Mr
Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, had several times approached
Germany to mediate in disputes between the US and France.

FT  12 JUL 93 / Lilley welcomes proposal on pension privatisation: Labour MP
says state should abandon basic provision
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE POLITICAL debate over Britain's welfare state broadened yesterday when
Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, welcomed a Labour MP's proposals
for privatising state pensions.
Mr Lilley said that the paper by Mr Frank Field, Labour MP for Birkenhead,
would be considered by the government as part of its long-term review of
public spending. His comments seemed calculated to embarrass the Labour
leadership, which has been trying to capitalise on the controversy over the
government's long-term review of public spending and its impact on less
well-off pensioners.
Mr Lilley said he was keen to encourage greater private provision of
pensions - but stopped short of endorsing Mr Field's suggestion that the
basic state pension should be privatised. The basic pension would remain
'the building block on which people can build their own additional
provision,' Mr Lilley said.
Ministers are committed to manifesto pledges to protect the basic state
pension, but Mr Lilley wants to encourage debate on proposals which could be
included in the Conservatives' next election manifesto.
In a separate part of the social security department's spending review, Mr
Lilley is studying UK rules on paying unemployment benefit to citizens of
other European Community countries to see if they can be tightened without
breaking EC regulations on the free movement of labour.
Mr Lilley's success in promoting debate on pensions, however, could backfire
as the Tory party struggles to win the Christchurch by-election, where a
third of the population are pensioners. The Conservatives are defending a
majority of 23,000.
Adding to the government's difficulties this week are the prospect of
another intervention in the debate on Maastricht by Baroness Thatcher when
the House of Lords debates a referendum on the treaty on Wednesday. There is
also the threat of a government defeat on the treaty's social chapter when
it is debated in the Commons and Lords on July 26.
In his pamphlet published today, Mr Field, chairman of the cross-party
Commons social security committee, proposes the imposition of a statutory
duty on employers to contribute six per cent of gross earnings to private
schemes on their employees' behalf. He says the basic state pension scheme
could eventually be abandoned.
Among Labour leaders, Mr David Blunkett, health spokesman, described Mr
Field as a 'maverick' and said he wanted a welfare state 'which we will all
contribute to and which we all draw on'. He rejected '1930s' ideas of a
system with only a safety net for the worse off.
Mr Donald Dewar, social security spokesman, said: 'No one in the Labour
Party wants a two-tier system with those who can afford it opting out and
the basic pension relegated to a fall-back safety net provision.'

FT  12 JUL 93 / The Lex Column: Scottish Water
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The government's proposals for Scottish water suggest it has come round to
the view that the sledge hammer of privatisation is not required to crack
the public spending nut. Scotland's three new water authorities will remain
in public sector control, but with powers to attract private capital. That
will conveniently remove up to Pounds 5bn from the public sector borrowing
requirement over the next decade with less risk of opprobrium from voters
north of the border. Since only 1 per cent of respondents to last year's
consultation paper were in favour of privatisation, a compromise was always
on the cards.
On what terms private sector capital will be invited to participate remains
an open question. The new authorities might offer three big, long-term
operating contracts - on the French model - or a series of smaller contracts
for building and operating individual plants. Either way, the private sector
will be responsible for providing capital as well as manpower. The bigger
water companies may thus enjoy some competitive advantage by dint of their
lower average cost of funds. The French giants Lyonnaise and Generale des
Eaux will doubtless jostle for position near the front of the queue.
Since English water companies are anxious for unregulated earnings, the
likes of North West and Thames cannot be ruled out of the running. Building
a water treatment plant in Strathclyde may be viewed in much the same light
as processing sewage in Kuala Lumpur, only rather less risky. The return
they are prepared to accept under such competitive conditions will be a
telling pointer to whether the English regulator has kept them on a tight
enough rein.

FT  12 JUL 93 / The Lex Column: French privatisation
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
With western European governments vying to raise up to Dollars 150bn (Pounds
101.4bn) by selling corporate assets over the next five years, France seems
well placed to steal the biggest slice of the privatisation gateau. The
French government may realise FFr360bn (Pounds 41.5bn) from selling off 21
companies on its initial list. This will help tame its budget deficit. It
will also have wider economic significance: expanding the Paris stock market
by as much as one-fifth; swelling the ranks of private shareholders; and
sharpening the competitiveness of corporate France.
Some companies on the list, such as Elf Aquitaine, are well known quoted
businesses which should easily attract investors. The Paris market has been
starved of good quality industrial stocks. The government, though, may face
a stiffer challenge in selling others, such as Air France and Bull, which
require extensive restructuring. Moreover, recent opinion polls suggest the
public is lukewarm about the programme. This is hardly surprising after the
unhappy experiences surrounding the first wave of privatisation. Having been
seduced into buying shares in 1986, investors grimly watched the market
crash the following year. Since then, most have reverted to high interest
money market funds.
The government, though, has been devising schemes to rekindle enthusiasm for
equities. Tax breaks, free shares and higher dividends for loyal
shareholders are some of the latest wheezes. The FFr40bn Balladur bond,
convertible into shares in privatised stocks, provides a further ingenious
enticement.
The critical determinant of privatisation's success, however, may be the
scale of foreign involvement. Despite the irritations of French companies'
shareholding structures, international investors seem tempted. This largely
reflects the belief that the government cannot afford privatisation to fail.
The hope is that the best assets will be sold first at attractive prices.
The conservative government certainly needs tangible successes before the
presidential elections in 1995. Hemmed in by the big budget deficit, the
strong franc and a commitment to fiscal austerity, the government will rely
heavily on privatisation proceeds to help stimulate the fast fading economy.
The need to tackle unemployment is a political imperative. Ironically,
unemployment may worsen as companies heading for privatisation cut their
workforces.
The precarious state of the economy will remain the greatest worry. Sanguine
investors may believe recession will enable them to invest at the bottom of
the cycle. The majority, though, will surely be deterred by the dismal
outlook for corporate earnings. Given the pressures, the French government
must be sorely tempted to sell its soul and permit the franc's devaluation.
Such a Faustian compact would be the balm for almost all its short-term
ills. Falling interest rates, a surging stock market and renascent
industrial competitiveness would provide the perfect backdrop for the
flotation of privatisation issues. If last week's market pressures develop,
the government's resolve may be fiercely tested once again.

FT  12 JUL 93 / The Lex Column: Prudential regulation
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Mick Newmarch of the Prudential has made no secret of his implacable
opposition to the Personal Investment Authority, the proposed
self-regulatory body for retail financial services. The freedom of
investment firms to choose their regulator is enshrined in the Financial
Services Act, so the threat of a boycott is by no means idle. Without the
willing participation of the country's biggest life insurer, the PIA would
lack credibility. Since Mr Andrew Large of the Securities and Investments
Board has made the PIA's success a cornerstone of his crusade to make the
two-tier regulatory system work, the stakes are high.
Others in the industry have chosen a more pragmatic approach: since the
government is unwilling to introduce new legislation, the best chance of
avoiding an embarrassing public row is to make the best of the existing
system by signing up with the PIA. But it remains uncertain whether the PIA
will deliver an adequate standard of regulation. Even full transparency on
sales commissions for life assurance might not weed out sharp practice. Mr
Newmarch is surely correct to say that a regulator capable of banning
inadequate savings products and over-enthusiastic sales methods may yet be
required.
It is unlikely that the PIA - even with the participation of all comers -
could fulfil such a role. Without statutory backing and an independent cast,
the conflicts of interest would be great. It is a gamble, but if Mr
Newmarch's opposition forces the government to look again at the question of
legislation he will be doing the financial community a service.

FT  12 JUL 93 / Clarke plans defence against EC charges on budget deficit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, will today mount a defence against
charges from his European Community partners that the British government is
overestimating the impact economic growth will have in curbing its Pounds
50bn budget deficit.
The charges are likely to surface at a meeting of EC finance ministers in
Brussels today, where Mr Clarke is due to present Britain's plans for
bringing its economy into line with the criteria for economic and monetary
union set out in the Maastricht treaty.
However, some ministers may wish to avoid further disharmony given renewed
tensions in the European exchange rate mechanism and the weakness of the
French franc.
The franc could face more pressure in the foreign exchanges this week as
traders try to test the strength of Franco-German monetary co-operation.
Last week the Bank of France intervened to support the franc, but the
operation failed to stop the French currency falling below FFr3.40 to the
D-Mark, little more than 3 centimes above its ERM floor of FFr3.433. The
fall came as French short-term interest rates rose sharply. On Friday they
were above German money market rates for the first time in nearly two
months.
If the franc's decline continues, the markets will be watching to see if the
Bundesbank comes to its rescue, allowing German monetary policy to be swayed
by speculators, or whether it ignores the French currency's plight.
The European Commission makes no secret of its desire for the British pound
and Italian lira to return to the ERM. Britain's floating exchange rate
policy and the fact that it can expect higher economic growth in 1993 and
1994 compared to its EC partners may have coloured debate over its
'convergence' plan.
During a recent meeting of the EC's secretive monetary committee, composed
of senior Treasury and central bank officials from the 12 member states,
several members challenged the UK government's contention that over
two-thirds of the budget deficit was due to cyclical economic factors, and
would therefore recede with economic recovery.
Others complained that UK forecasts of a cut in the deficit from 8 per cent
of gross domestic product this year to 3.75 per cent in 1997-98 still left
the deficit above the Maastricht target of no more than 3 per cent. This
underlined that the UK was 'not serious' about Emu, one EC official said.
Mr Clarke is expected to argue that it is very difficult to measure how far
the deficit is cyclical and how much it represents a structural increase in
spending. He will also say the UK convergence plan is more realistic that
some programmes put forward by other member states.
The Ecofin meeting is also expected to discuss plans to improve multilateral
surveillance of member states' economies.

Meanwhile, even if the New York Post is bound for the breakers, perhaps
Murdoch could at least prevent the Big Apple's favourite baseball club from
transferring its flag to another city.
That is the fate being threatened for the New York Yankees by their
tempestuous owner George Steinbrenner. And though he has mouthed menaces
before, this time he seems deadly serious.
The Yankees' successes haven't stopped attendances from falling by more than
a third these past five years, which Steinbrenner blames partly on the
rundown stadium, nicknamed the Bronx zoo after its site in one of the
poorest districts around. Put bluntly, his ultimatum is that either New York
helps to rebuild the stadium, or the team will leave for financially
friendlier climes.
Understandably, being desperate to revive the impoverished South Bronx, New
York's governor Mario Cuomo wants the Yankees to stay put. But if
Steinbrenner insists on moving when his lease expires, then Cuomo would like
to set up the club up on a 30-acre site west of midtown Manhattan.
In which case, it is hoped, Murdoch might be tempted to finance the building
of a new home for the Yankees as part of a huge new entertainment complex.
After all, while the plan sounds mightily expensive, it is of a scale to
match his far from under-developed ego, not to mention those of Cuomo and
Steinbrenner to boot.
The three of them have already had a preliminary discussion, Observer hears.

As the New York Post sinks in the west, Rupert Murdoch is evidently
preparing a new launch in the Pacific. Although he gave up keeping a yacht
after moving from Australia to London, his move to sunny Los Angeles has set
sea fever burning again.
The result is a custom-built sailing boat which, if it successfully
completes its trials in the Mediterranean later in the summer, will set
course for California and the South Seas.
A sign that the News Corporation boss is beginning to wind down for
retirement? On the contrary, the buzz round the fleet is that it more
probably portends his intention to establish new business beach-heads in
Asia.
Accordingly - and even though, at 100ft-plus overall, the vessel is modest
compared with the flagships of other media moguls - it would be more fitting
to address him as Admiral than Cap'n.

the local nightlife is clearly bidding for intellectual acclaim.
In September, Manchester's Institute for Popular Culture is hosting two days
of egg-head discussions on the economic impact of the evening economy of
cities, in which the star attraction will be a chance to 'experience
Manchester's night-time economy at first hand'.

FT  12 JUL 93 / Observer: High merit, low hope
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
What price a Brit as next president of the European Commission in the wake
of last week's successful trade negotiations?
With Jacques Delors due to go at the start of 1995, there's little doubt
who'd be the UK's ideal choice: EC trade commissioner and former cabinet
minister, Sir Leon Brittan. Whitehall has been impressed by his skill in
guiding the market opening negotiations of the 'quad' group of countries to
fruition, as well as by his performance at the G7 summit in Tokyo.
While national political leaders were quick to claim credit for progress
towards a global tariff-cutting agreement, Brittan could fairly reflect that
it was he who started the talks on the way to breakthrough.
He broached the idea of a market-access deal with the outgoing US
administration in January, and later took it up with Bill Clinton's special
US trade representative, Mickey Kantor. It was only after the two of them
had gained useful ground together that Japan and Canada joined the EC-US
discussions to make up the 'quad' group.
Alas, whatever Brittan's merits, his home country would look to have little
hope of securing the EC commission presidency for him, even if further trade
talks in Geneva bring a successful end to the long-stalled Uruguay Round.
For one thing, it isn't all that long since the UK supplied the president:
Roy - now Lord - Jenkins held the post in the late 1970s. For another,
regardless of Premier Major's rhetoric about Britain being at the heart of
Europe, London would find it hard, if not impossible, to win support for a
Brit from 'federalist' EC member states.
So the UK will probably concentrate on blocking any overtly 'federal'
candidate for the post. Hence former Belgian prime minister Wilfried Martens
could expect a veto from London, as likewise might Felipe Gonzalez if he
decides to abandon the Spanish premiership for Brussels.
From a UK viewpoint, the Netherlands premier Ruud Lubbers would be a more
desirable candidate to replace the departing Delors. True, like most Dutch
politicians, Lubbers believes in a federal future for Europe. But he is a
free marketeer and, as such, stands well in John Major's esteem.

FT  12 JUL 93 / Trade and macroeconomics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Tokyo trade package is likely to help growth, jobs and output, even
though some of the estimates given by summit participants are highly
misleading. The main reason growth should benefit is given by that
unsatisfactory, but occasionally unavoidable, word 'confidence'. News that
increases the chances of a successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round should
raise what Keynes called the 'animal spirits' of businessmen when they
consider whether to invest, increase stocks or take on workers.
Although this effect is probable, I am much more certain of a negative
statement. A breakdown of the Gatt talks and the associated risk of trade
wars, would have dealt a severe blow to confidence at a time when it is
fragile and would have risked turning prolonged recession into depression.
It is, however, noticeable that neither academic macroeconomists nor
economic commentators have been in the forefront of the trade debate. One of
the reasons is the pressure of specialisation. Trade negotiations are
detailed, commodity-by-commodity affairs which only full-time experts can
follow properly.
There is a more interesting reason for the lack of contact between the two
worlds. This is the difficulty of making true intellectual contact, which
goes back a very long time. In most popular histories of the Great
Depression, the savage increase in the US tariffs under the Smoot-Hawley Act
of 1930 is given a large role in converting the recession of the early 1930s
into the Great Depression. Yet it receives hardly a mention in many
monetarist and Keynesian accounts. I can find no reference to it or anything
related to it in either Friedman's Monetary History or Galbraith's Great
Crash.
In contemporary debates, macroeconomists have used the threat of 'increased
protection' (please not 'protectionism', which adds a redundant extra
syllable and should be used only to describe the belief, not the phenomenon)
to browbeat their opponents about what would happen if their own favourite
nostrums failed to be accepted.
There is a real difficulty in translating from the world of trade
negotiations into that of conjunctural issues. The frequent citations of the
number of jobs supposed to be created are based on the Gatt estimate of a
Dollars 200bn (Pounds 133bn) per annum increase in world trade from a
successful conclusion of the whole Uruguay Round. But this usage is a cheat.
The Gatt estimate is of the increase in trade between countries, not of
output, not of welfare and still less of employment. Freer trade reallocates
jobs more efficiently inside each country but does not directly destroy or
create new jobs.
There are yet further reasons for the embarrassment of economists on trade
issues. They can be summed up by Friedman's saying, 'Protection is better in
theory; free trade is better in practice.' There have been recurrent
complicated theories over the centuries trying to show that there are
benefits to individual countries from certain carefully chosen kinds of
protection. The May issue of the American Economic Review is partly devoted
to professional disquiet on what the public and their students should
therefore be told.
Professor Paul Krugman, who has invented many of the supposed exceptions to
free trade theory, now believes that the likely benefits are small; that any
exceptions will be wrongly chosen; and that undergraduates will benefit more
from a thorough exposure to the mainline case for free trade.
Most popular support for protection has nothing to do with esoteric trade
theories. 'How can we compete,' it is asked, 'with Czech workers being paid
a tenth of ours and south-east Asian workers being paid one hundredth?' The
most effective refutation is to be found not in trade theory but in the
elementary macroeconomic exposition of the circular flow of funds.
An excellent example is in Friedman's Free To Choose, where he shows step by
step how the proceeds from Japanese exports (the bogey when he was writing)
are used either directly to purchase goods from other countries or
contribute indirectly by capital exports. The plague of popular economic
discussion is the fear of what Mill called a general glut; and there is no
more important task than to explain why a glut is extremely unlikely given a
background of moderately sensible fiscal, monetary and exchange rate
policies.

FT  12 JUL 93 / Leading Article: Defining the fiscal deficit
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DEBATE over the UK budget deficit is taking place in a fog of spurious
assertions about how much of it is 'cyclical' and how much is 'structural'.
It is a crucial question, but the truth is that no-one will know the answer
for a number of years, if ever. In the meantime, the government should focus
more on reducing the deficit and rather less on defining it.
At a meeting of European Community finance ministers Kenneth Clarke will
today be defending the British government's economic plans against the
charge that they betray undue optimism about the Pounds 50bn budget deficit.
The criticism is partly based on John Major's claim that 70 per cent of the
gap is cyclical, and will therefore fall as the economy picks up. EC
officials consider this dangerously complacent, citing OECD estimates that
less than half of the deficit, now 8 per cent of GDP, can be so summarily
dismissed. The rest, they say, is a structural increase in spending that
requires further attention. Which is right?
The sheer size of the gap between deficit 'cyclists' and 'structuralists' is
a good clue that the desire for precision is misplaced. Both sides could
make things clearer, however, if they bothered to separate two distinct
issues. First, what part of the rise in public borrowing has occurred as a
result of the recession? And second, how much of that will go away as the
economy picks up again? The first question can be answered relatively
easily. Unfortunately, it is not the one upon which the sustainability of
the British public finances depends.
Lower tax revenues
The automatic effects on the budget of the recent decline in UK output are
quite well understood. If, in 1990, the British economy had continued to
grow at a steady pace, output would now be around 7 per cent higher. Losing
that output to the recession led to higher public spending and lower tax
revenues which between them left the Public Sector Borrowing Requirement
4.75 per cent higher as a percentage of GDP than it would otherwise have
been.
Where Britain is headed depends on how much of that lost 7 per cent of total
output is still on offer, and how fast the economy can make it up. On the
first, most accept that the length of the recession has taken its toll on
industrial capacity and skill levels. Reasonable estimates suggest that the
amount of usable spare capacity - or 'output gap' - is closer to 3 per cent.
In theory, the economy could safely grow faster than its trend growth rate
of 2.25-2.50 per cent per annum, until at least this degree of slack was
used up. But whether the UK is soon in a position to achieve faster than
trend growth may depend less on the output gap than on the speed of world
recovery, domestic consumption patterns and the state of the labour market,
all of which consistently defy forecasters' predictions.
Accelerating debt
The size of the UK Public Sector Borrowing Requirement sets a clock ticking
on Britain's uncertain growth prospects, because of the cumulative effect on
the national debt. If British GDP were to grow 3 per cent on average over
the next three years, the PSBR should fall to around 4 per cent of GDP in
1997. By then, consistently high levels of public borrowing would have
increased the national debt to 55 percent of GDP compared with 42 per cent
in 1992. If, however, yearly growth averaged only 1.5 per cent, the PSBR
would be almost unchanged and the debt ratio would be rising towards 75
percent. This kind of accelerating debt would have too many of the traits of
the 1976 crisis.
Mr Clarke may be unable to control either the degree of spare capacity in
the economy or the rate at which it grows over the next few years. He can,
however, determine how much any given rate of growth goes towards reducing
the PSBR. Considering the stakes involved, he should commit himself to
tightening fiscal policy further, as a hedge against disappointing growth.
If this turns out to be over-cautious, he could always compensate by
lowering interest rates. Better that he lose the prize for labelling the
deficit correctly than risk the horrors of an old-fashioned public debt
crisis.

FT  12 JUL 93 / In search of the urban idyll: There is a new spirit of civic
entrepreneurship in Europe's cities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Just before the International Olympic Committee meets in Monte Carlo in
September to choose where to stage the 2000 games, a trade mission from
north-west England plans to fly to Paris.
The idea is to take advantage of the publicity surrounding Manchester's
Olympic bid. Members of the mission, put together by Manchester Chamber of
Commerce and Industry and the accountants, lawyers, bankers and business
advisers who make up the city's Financial and Professional Forum, will be
talking to their opposite numbers in the Paris chamber about doing more
business together.
Such marketing is part of a new age of civic entrepreneurship in Europe,
according to Professor Michael Parkinson, director of the European Institute
for Urban Affairs at Liverpool John Moores University. He says it started
less than 10 years ago, with several of Europe's old cities fighting back
against what was widely seen as terminal decline.
Public and private sectors have banded together, sometimes informally,
sometimes through organisations formed to promote the cities they depend on
for a living. All have pushed cities rather than regions, and broad economic
development rather than solutions to specific urban social problems.
Parkinson's institute - which used to be the Centre for Urban Studies at
Liverpool University, but negotiated a transfer to the more entrepreneurial
'Liverpool John' last year - has recently completed a three-year study of 24
cities for the European Commission*.
One of the most telling examples is Hamburg. In 1985 its chamber of commerce
and 10 leading banks set up the Hamburg Business Development Corporation to
attract new companies and improve support for existing ones. Target sectors
were the media, information technology, electronics, aviation, medicine,
biotechnology, harbour services and environmental technologies.
Urda Martens-Jeebe, the corporation's director, says its first five years
brought in 387 new companies: 81 from Germany, the rest from Scandinavia,
Taiwan, China, the UK, Japan, Korea and the US. The corporation acted as
consultant to 769 businesses. She says an estimated 16,000 jobs were created
and capital investment of DM3.7bn (Pounds 1.45bn) boosted construction.
Other cities have used particular events as a focus for team-building.
Manchester's Olympic bid is an example. According to KPMG Peat Marwick, the
accountant, Manchester's bid will be worth Pounds 200m to the city even if
the bid fails.
Last week, Ogden, a leading US entertainment management group, signed a
20-year contract to run the Manchester arena from its opening in 1995. The
group will create more than 700 jobs in the city.
Other cities behaving in an entrepreneurial manner include:
Rotterdam's development board, Rotor, a joint venture of the municipality
and the chamber of commerce. It works as a think-tank, helping to balance
social concerns such as poor housing with economic solutions.
The city's publicly owned port authority modernised the docks and improved
the local transport infrastructure. Parallel investment in office space by
the private sector during the 1980s has been justified by annual growth of
up to 10 per cent in the numbers employed in professional services. A
'brainpark' for small, high-technology companies was set up near a
university.
Dortmund's civic leaders developed closer ties with the private sector after
a large factory closure in 1981. As a result, the emphasis switched from
social to economic priorities.
Research and development centres for transport technology and robotics were
attracted, and a technology transfer system set up between university,
polytechnic and the chamber of commerce. Montpellier evolved what it called
a 'technopole' strategy in 1985 - a development agency supported by all
sectors of the community to focus growth on medicine, computer technology,
agronomics, communications and leisure.
'Cities are back on the agenda, not as basket cases but as economic
leaders,' Parkinson says. 'Cities have to be re-evaluated. They need to be
recognised again as the wealth of nations. They are great sources of added
value. In Europe, there is an emerging network of cities with similar
entrepreneurial outlooks.'
He suggests the most successful entrepreneurial cities are those which have
defined themselves as European, rather than by their regional or national
role. Glasgow, Manchester, Birmingham, Rotterdam, Hamburg, Barcelona, Lyons,
Lille, Dortmund, Stuttgart, Frankfurt and Milan are all examples.
Many have started forming trans-European networks. For example, Rotterdam
Port Promotions Council, backed by most Netherlands businesses dependent on
trade through the Maas estuary, has been touring Europe this year to build
contacts and seek out business. It stresses Rotterdam's 'gateway' role to
Europe's road, rail and inland waterway freight networks.
Another example is Manchester, which has joined an association of similar
regional capitals that have developed as financial centres in their own
right, shaking off the domination of their countries' capital cities.
Manchester boasts more than 50 banks from around the world and a 50-strong
venture capital community. There is also a group of 100 corporate finance
advisers that offers 'mini merchant banking' for medium-sized companies,
acting in mergers, acquisitions and disposals. Their fee income is running
at more than Pounds 20m a year. Other cities in the group include Barcelona,
Bilbao, Turin, Stuttgart, Lyons and Edinburgh.
A network of successful cities, therefore, seems to be emerging across
Europe, with each a focus for growth and regional economic hegemony. Even
the urban population decline of the 1970s and 1980s is slowing as old cities
bounce back.
Parkinson says: 'After 15 years of decline, at some point in the mid-1980s,
big cities started to grow again, or at the very least, they started
stabilising. The trend is solid and is reversing the former outward drift of
population. We are developing a Europe of the cities, not a Europe of the
regions.'
One problem of such patchwork economic development is that benefits are not
evenly distributed between cities, within them, or between cities and the
regions around them. In some cases, inequalities are emerging between
neighbours. Marseilles, for example, has not developed a coherent strategy
like Montpellier and, Parkinson says, lags in economic development.
Liverpool similarly lags behind Manchester, only 35 miles away. This is
partly because it is smaller, with a less diverse economic base. One in six
men traditionally earns a living through manual work. Male unemployment
rates of about 25 per cent have fuelled internal divisions in the city and -
for 10 years to 1991 - caused image-damaging political strife. Only this
year have public and private sectors set up an office to work together -
seven or eight years behind comparable cities.
Even within successful cities, individual beneficiaries are mainly educated,
qualified or trained people. Parkinson warns: 'You have a polarised labour
market, overlaid with the problems of ethnic minorities and immigrants. Some
people are being excluded. We found that Hamburg has more millionaires than
anywhere else in Europe, but more people on welfare. One of the key
challenges of the next couple of decades will be how to include the
excluded. Another will be how to improve a city's competitiveness without
increasing the social cost.'
One problem for the European Community is that it allocates funds for
economic development on the basis of reducing regional imbalances. But this
means two cities with similar problems are treated differently because of
their geographical location.
If the Europe of the cities thesis proves correct, it may require some shift
in the way the EC targets its regional aid. But the bigger implication is
that, as cities compete in the way that corporations do, the case for better
urban government, capable of taking a long view about investment in
infrastructure and human resources, will become ever more irresistible.

FT  12 JUL 93 / Leading Article: Mr Yeltsin's dwindling power
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
RUSSIA'S President Boris Yeltsin insisted that he went to last week's summit
of the Group of Seven industrial nations in Tokyo as leader of a great
power. But at home, the state he represents is looking weaker by the day.
Government remains gripped by debilitating, and overlapping, power struggles
between president and parliament, centre and regions. Mr Yeltsin battles to
gain acceptance of a complex new constitution, and in the process hands away
an increasing array of powers and rights from the centre. And one by one,
Russia's regions appear to be seizing their own destiny: in the past 10 days
alone, the parliaments of the Far Eastern region and of Sverdlovsk in the
Urals have claimed the status of republics within Russia, thus asserting
greater economic independence an escalating battle between the regions and
the centre for control over resources.
In theory, the outcome of this process could be violent anarchy, as
ever-smaller units of population or territory dispute the legitimacy or
effectiveness of rule from Moscow and take matters into their own hands. In
practice, it has not yet come to that. But to prevent the current mess
turning into something a great deal worse, Russia obviously needs greater
clarity in the relations between its multifarious centres of power. Ideally,
this would be provided by a new constitution setting out in brief, general
but unequivocal terms the respective rights and duties of the Russian state
and its subjects. Unfortunately, this is far from what seems to be emerging
from the constitutional debate which is now reaching a climax.
Empty rights
Russia cannot continue with its present, Soviet-era, constitution, patched
up with liberal additions. Its main flaw, graphically demonstrated at
succeeding Congresses of People's Deputies over the past year, is that it
gave ample but empty rights to the Supreme Soviet (legislature) and made
little provision for an executive president. Despite the popular mandate
with which he was elected in 1991, Mr Yeltsin's attempts to run a democratic
presidential republic with a communist 'parliamentary' constitution were
doomed to end in confrontation.
The problem is that this struggle cannot begin to be decisively resolved
without adoption of a new, more legitimate constitution - and that such a
constitution cannot legally be adopted without the agreement of the Supreme
Soviet, a body which would thus be voting itself out of existence. Though Mr
Yeltsin's hand has strengthened, especially since the endorsement of the
April referendum, he is still in the position of having to act
unconstitutionally in order to put the state on a democratic base - a move
he has seemed prepared to make several times but from which he has always
backed away.
Structural problems
The important question is whether the constitution as it is emerging is the
right one for Russia and will stand the test of time. It is admirably
dedicated to human and civil rights; underpins the right to private
property; and pledges allegiance to independent judiciary and media. But it
is too long on detail, some of it contradictory. It gives citizens too many
economic rights like free medical care, employment and minimum wages which
Russia cannot fulfil.
Worst of all, it does not address the deep structural problems left behind
by the Soviet state, simply accepting the Lenin-Stalin territorial division
of the country into regions and 'ethno-territorial' republics and granting
the latter more rights than the former. Small wonder that the regions are
now seeking to redress the imbalance by declaring themselves as republics
too, and that Russia's most numerically important minorities - the
Caucasians, Central Asians, Balts and Ukrainians - complain they have been
left without guarantees of their linguistic and other cultural rights.
All this may not prevent Mr Yeltsin from forcing through his constitution in
something resembling its present form. But it is hard to see such a document
settling Russia's chronic constitutional uncertainties once and for all. As
they promise yet more money to assist the country's political and economic
transformation - and to shore up Mr Yeltsin's centre - G7 leaders would do
well to remember that on both fronts, the evolution is going to be both
protracted and messy. It is in no one's interest that Russia should
disintegrate, but in the end no one may be able to stop it doing so.

FT  12 JUL 93 / Letter: Cadbury should concentrate on working capital not
profit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr A H WALLIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I was disappointed, but not entirely surprised, to read that
implementation of the 'going concern' requirement of the Cadbury Code is to
be deferred ('Cadbury guidelines face delay', July 5).
Perhaps the reason may be seen in the approach of the working party which
produced the draft guidelines. In a worthy endeavour to make them
comprehensive, it has fallen into the trap of making them over-prescriptive,
introducing a number of factors which are either obvious or irrelevant. The
result is a suggested procedure which is far more complicated than, in the
majority of cases, it need be.
The working party rejected the normal approach to profit forecasts, on the
grounds that the work involved was excessive and it was not part of the
reporting accountant's brief to comment on the assumptions. Both objections
could be surmounted if it could be agreed that the objective is for the
directors to be able to say, and the auditors to confirm, that 'the company
has adequate working capital for its needs, and the accounts have therefore
been prepared on a going concern basis'. Such a statement could be
incorporated in the statement of directors' responsibilities.
The advantage of a working capital statement is that the procedures are well
understood by most boards and practitioners, and are less onerous than those
relating to a profit forecast. It should normally be possible to obtain from
bankers a statement to the effect that they see no reason why the company's
committed facilities should not be extended beyond the review date, thus
allowing the board to look to a date 18 months beyond the balance sheet
date. It is then a matter of judgment whether the requirement can be
satisfied by a relatively simple desk job, or whether a more rigorous
'bottom-up' exercise is needed.
Such a task, which my company has carried out in recent years, to the
satisfaction of the board and the auditors, has not proved unduly onerous or
expensive. Of course, where the exercise shows a company is operating near
the margin, it will need to be followed up by a more rigorous examination.
However, the majority of companies do not operate close to the margin and,
given a proper exercise of judgment by the auditors, attention could be
concentrated on the smaller percentage of companies which have given rise to
the concerns addressed by the Cadbury report.

FT  12 JUL 93 / Danger of the simple route: The Royal Commission on Criminal
Justice
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE STAPLE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fraud is a crime which leaves chaos in its wake. In many cases, investors
suffer substantial loss. Often savings built up over a lifetime's work
disappear. Those charged with responsibility for investigating and
prosecuting serious fraud will find much to welcome in the report of the
Royal Commission on Criminal Justice. The commission has carefully addressed
the issues and given a firm pointer for the future.
Although lessons from a small number of high-profile cases were learnt long
ago, the Serious Fraud Office continues to be criticised for the way in
which those cases were handled. It is the SFO's policy to narrow the
investigation, as far as possible, and then to charge only the principal
participants in the fraud with a reasonable number of offences.
However, there is a point beyond which it is dangerous to simplify. We must
not sacrifice thoroughness for brevity and run the risk of prosecutions
collapsing at a later stage. The SFO has always worked to a target of one
year for an investigation and one year for the prosecution. Now the Royal
Commission has proposed that targets should be set for the amount of time to
be taken up by each stage of the trial. It has also proposed that written
skeleton arguments be submitted in advance and that time limits be imposed
on oral argument. These would be valuable new disciplines.
An extended debate has taken place while the Commission has been sitting.
Many of the ideas canvassed have found a place in its report. For instance,
much has been said on whether certain City offences should be dealt with in
the criminal courts or by the regulatory bodies. While the criminal justice
system cannot abdicate responsibility for prosecuting serious fraudulent
conduct, there may well be cases where regulatory action would be more
appropriate.
The SFO continually keeps possible reference to a regulator under review in
the course of its investigations and prosecutions. The commission has
endorsed this approach, provided regulatory action is capable of ensuring
that a person found guilty by the appropriate regulatory tribunal can be
banned from the market and ordered to compensate the victims.
The SFO is currently in discussion with the regulators about mechanisms
which might lead to more cases being handled by the regulators - with its
agreement.
The SFO supports the commission's desire to see a system which would mean
that a decision on whether or not to prosecute, and the choice of charge,
could take into account a defendant's readiness to accept a regulatory
penalty of sufficient severity to justify dropping the prosecution or
reducing the charge. It would require the defendant's agreement to the
regulatory penalty, and, if prosecuted on a lesser charge, to pleading
guilty to that charge.
Under Section 2 of the Criminal Justice Act 1987, the director of the SFO
can compel a person to answer questions or produce documents on pain of
prosecution and up to six months' imprisonment if he refuses to answer. It
must be remembered that fraud is uniquely a document-based crime. Without a
means of getting at the underlying material, it would be impossible to find
out what happened. Section 2 is mainly used for that purpose.
Banks and professional firms are usually happy to co-operate when they
receive a notice under the Section. It is also used to interview suspects,
but the safeguard is that the power is only investigatory. A transcript of
an interview under the Section cannot be admitted in evidence unless the
witness changes his story. Also the legal professional privilege applies.
The commission has concluded that it is necessary and right that
investigators in serious fraud cases should retain the section 2 power. That
is welcome news to those who face the task of unravelling these immensely
complex cases.
Contrary to the belief of some of the SFO's critics, the commission found
that this power had worked in the interests of justice. Moreover, it
considered the section had not been unfair to those questioned, who were
likely to be persons in responsible positions with ready access to legal
advice charged with sophisticated offences which might otherwise go not
merely unpunished but undetected.
The commission would also like to see section 2 being used to help
investigations conducted in the UK on behalf of foreign investigating
authorities and, significantly, in support of many investigations at present
undertaken with guidance from the fraud investigation group of the Crown
Prosecution Service.
A feasibility study is recommended into the possibility of merging the two
fraud authorities.
The commission has, however, gone further. It considers that section 2
should, on the authority of the director, be extended to the police. That is
not, in fact, something for which the SFO has pressed, but it clearly
deserves careful consideration.
Some change is also recommended to the culture of the criminal justice
system. Currently, the prosecution lays bare its store of knowledge and
evidence to the defence at an early stage, while the defence can keep its
case up its sleeve until the trial.
The system dates back to the days when defendants were inarticulate,
uneducated and lacked the resources to defend themselves. It is, however,
quite inappropriate to serious fraud trials. Hence, the recommendation for
more advanced disclosure from the defence in such cases will reduce the
number of issues for the jury and vastly improve the management of cases.

</HEADLINE>

   From Mr ALASTAIR GOODLAD MP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Ms Spence's letter ('Poor UK show in Shanghai', July 2) asked why the
Foreign Office does not stop being archaic and get down to business. It has,
long ago, and it does, every day. She has clearly not had enough contact
with us to know this. If she has any complaints about the quality of our
post in Shanghai, she would give us details and we will investigate them. We
have had no other complaints about it. Our exports to China for the first
four months of this year show a 75 per cent increase over the same period
last year.
One of the FCO's main tasks is to help British business. Nearly 25 per cent
of our resources are devoted to it directly. Indirectly, much more. Our
customers tell us that we are providing them with the service that they
want. We wrote more than 6,000 market information reports for them last
year. Ninety per cent said they would use our services again.
The opportunities for British business in the Far East are enormous. The FCO
can help firms win that business. Let us all work together to improve
Britain's performance there even more.

FT  12 JUL 93 / Letter: Why Commission deserves two cheers on EC car pricing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr STEPHEN LOCKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, It is hard to avoid the conclusion that John Griffiths ('Exchange rates
main factor in European car price comparisons,' July 5) is looking through
the wrong end of the telescope in assessing the reasons for differences in
car prices between EC member states. Exchange rates in themselves are no
more responsible for price differences than the Retail Price Index is a
cause of inflation: they are merely a means of translating one country's
prices into a form which can be compared with another's. Short-term
fluctuations - especially dramatic ones such as those associated with the
exit of sterling, the lira, the Spanish peseta and the Portuguese escudo
from the Exchange Rate Mechanism last September - may upset long-established
comparisons, but they do not invalidate them.
The fact is that pre-tax car prices in the UK were well above those in most
other EC countries throughout the 1980s and early 1990s; even the
substantial fall in sterling against the D-Mark, Belgian franc, French franc
and Dutch guilder within the last year has done no more than shift the
general level of UK prices to roughly the EC average, with some models still
costing 20 to 30 per cent more than in other countries. Whether even this
state of affairs remains depends heavily on the car manufacturers' pricing
policies in the UK, and on the manufacturers' ability to resist the
temptation to return to their old view of this country as a high-price,
high-profit market where consumer interests come a long way down the list of
corporate priorities.
What underlying factors should guide car pricing in different EC countries
is an interesting issue for debate, as John Griffiths identifies. It may
well be that in a completely unrestrained market subject to differing tax
treatments in different areas, manufacturers would be justified in varying
their pre-tax prices in a way that maximises their investment returns. But
we don't have an unrestrained market - EC limits on price differences were
introduced as part of the 'deal' on selective and exclusive distribution
reached between the Commission and the manufacturers. Also, the Commission,
rightly, wanted to demonstrate the benefits that could flow directly to
consumers from a single, barrier-free market in the crucially important cars
sector.
For its efforts so far the Commission deserves at least two cheers from the
consumer corner - and the new data that will be generated by these
twice-yearly car price comparisons will start to give us a clear,
authoritative picture of whether the EC single market for cars is a myth or,
at last, a reality.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JAMES ROBERTSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your editorial, 'Full speed ahead on Gatt' (July 9) suggests that trade
negotiators 'are condemned to succeed' in a world trade agreement under the
Gatt. I beg to differ. Even after several years of negotiations, a Gatt
agreement is by no means assured. As you said, final agreement in
agriculture has not been reached; given the politically sensitive nature of
agriculture and the unwillingness of any of the G7 leaders to stand up to
special interest groups, agreement may not even be possible.
When they start to pay much more than lip service to a world trade
agreement, then the Uruguay Round could be completed in days. Given the lack
of western leadership in others areas such as Bosnia, I for one will not be
holding my breath.

FT  12 JUL 93 / Wrong crimes, wrong remedy: The Royal Commission on Criminal
Justice
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MONTY RAPHAEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Runciman is clearly not the last word on reforming the investigation,
prosecution and trial of serious fraud. Indeed, a half decade after the
changes inspired by the Roskill report, why was serious fraud even on the
agenda?
The answer lies in the curious way we have of responding to perceived
shortcomings in the criminal justice system. When our confidence in it is
punctured, we resort to a quick-fix patch of reform without first asking
whether it might not be better to replace the whole inner tube.
It was just such a response in the mid-1980s that led to the setting up of
the Roskill committee to reconsider the prosecution of fraud. It also
explains how its recommendations, or at least some of them, came to be
implemented. Before turning to Runciman's gloss on Roskill, the following
questions should be considered.
Why, when it now handles only a handful of cases, was it necessary to set up
the Serious Fraud Office as a separate high-profile agency at all? The Crown
Prosecution Service could have been better resourced nationally, with access
to accounting and other assistance, and have dealt with all fraud.
Where is the evidence that the Crown Prosecution Service, Customs or the
Inland Revenue are hampered by the fact that they lack the SFO's Section 2
powers removing the right to silence?
How is it that the whole of the US manages to prosecute white-collar crime
effectively while still preserving the Fifth Amendment right to silence and
without requiring advanced defence disclosure?
How is the performance of the SFO to be judged? Surely not by either media
campaigns or its conviction rate. Judged by convictions, it is doing well.
Only the tabloids suggest the SFO should ensure all suspects remain in jail
on remand and that it should deliver a 100 per cent conviction rate.
The best way to monitor the SFO would be to set up a Fraud Commission, one
of Lord Roskill's recommendations which was not implemented.
It is regrettable that Lord Runciman and his colleagues should not have not
thought fit to make this essential recommendation, so that in future we
would not have to appoint Royal Commissions to discover what is wrong in
this area.
What needs to be stressed about the Royal Commission's proposals is that
much caution should be shown before the SFO's powers are enhanced.
The commission recommends that the Section 2 powers of questioning and
evidence gathering should be given to the police as well as the SFO's
lawyers and accountants. The argument for this recommendation in the
commission's report is that it finds the present situation anomalous. The
commission does not say how the anomaly arises.
It arose after the Roskill Committee had recommended that the police should,
indeed, have these powers. But the government concluded those powers would
sit uncomfortably with what were then the recently introduced safeguards of
the Police and Criminal Evidence Act.
One may ask now what has occurred in the past seven years which makes this
judgment invalid?
If the commission's recommendations are introduced, what is to prevent the
same police officer interviewing a suspect under Section 2 and then
subsequently interviewing that suspect under caution? How is one to
safeguard the suspect then?
Indeed, if the SFO and CPS are merged we are looking at Section 2 powers
being delegated to possibly thousands of police officers nation-wide.
One of the commission's recommendations which appears to have received wide
public support is that proposing greater pre-trial disclosure by the
defence. Put that way, it seems a perfectly sensible, unobjectionable
proposal.
However, one has to consider to what extent the Crown is no longer to bear
the burden of proving an accused guilty and to what extent an accused is now
being asked to provide as much evidence as possible for his own personal
damnation.
Consider a situation where an accused, having fully met in a defence case
statement the prosecution's case, finds that the prosecution decides, quite
oppressively and on the basis of the accused's own disclosures, to change
tack and confront him with a completely new allegation.
One could envisage an absurd situation where the accused and the prosecution
are engaged in some co-operative effort whose object is not to achieve
fairness and justice, but to make certain that no person accused of serious
fraud is ever acquitted.
Perhaps even more worrying, however, is the recommendation that, just when
the Judith Ward case and others have secured for the defence access to all
the material in the prosecution's hands so that future miscarriages of
justice resulting from non-disclosure might be avoided, there is a
recommendation that this right be severely curtailed.
The commission recommends that the prosecution need disclose only that
material which it deems relevant following the revelation of the defence.
What about those cases, and I have experienced several, where hidden away in
the unused material there is a defence of which the accused knows nothing?
Are we now going further down the totally irrational path of saying that our
civil liberties must be preserved, if not enhanced, for those accused of
crime, but the one exception being made is for those accused of white-collar
crime?
Does society really believe they pose a greater threat than is posed by
those accused of murder, terrorism, robbery or rape?

FT  12 JUL 93 / Arts: Rope ensures a reputation - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ST GEORGE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Few plays now can afford an actor the chance to say 'You swine, you filthy
swine' without causing a ripple of mirth in the theatre. But those closing
lines of Patrick Hamilton's taut psychological thriller, Rope, ring like a
tocsin round the Minerva Theatre, Chichester, where Keith Baxter has
successfully revived the 1929 classic.
Rope shows how two Oxford undergraduates, Brandon and Granillo, murder their
friend Ronald. They conceal the body in a chest, and invite Ronald's father,
aunt and assorted friends to dine off the same chest. But one of the guests,
a louche poet called Rupert Cadell, discovers their perfect and motiveless
crime.
Stage time and theatre time are identical. After two hours, the dinner
service is cleared, and the questions from Rupert become more probing.
Before Brandon and Granillo can make off with the body, Rupert returns,
confronts them, and wrings a confession.
Hamilton's writing is everywhere detailed, the stage directions punctilious:
'He responds vaguely, as one who has only half understood'. Yet it is also
powerful, making psychological sense of the 'foul, lewd and infamous jest',
fashioning a drama of Jacobean scope and Jonsonian bravado. The play moves
the thriller genre into drama, but does so by avoiding the whodunnit
formula.
The direction (Keith Baxter) serves the purpose exactly. Each time new
information arrives, the situation and the characters change. The opening,
completely dark except for the two actors' glowing cigarettes which identify
them, is all tension and uncertainty: 'Do you think we'll get away with it?'
The dinner-party performance which follows manages to maintain the sense
that Brandon and Granillo are both acting and reacting as circumstances
change. The action sprawls over the false-perspective set, a thunder storm
worrying at the murderers throughout.
The acting of the three principals keeps pace with the subtleties of
Hamilton's plot. Brandon (John Barrowman) differentiates himself neatly from
the less expansive and much surlier Granillo (Alexis Denisof). Throughout
the party, both indulge the thrill of a healthy crime and the sprezzatura of
its execution. Both characters drink heavily, and at times stagger round the
stage like bleary bachelors at a stag party. But their interchanges have an
excitement and breathlessness born naturally out of their situation.
Rupert (Anthony Head) is all fastidiousness and frolic, a cultured creature
already world-weary and bored, but witty enough to know it: 'Of course I
honour my parents. I send them a telegram of congratulations each year on my
birthday.' Whether the killers will hang depends on his attitude, a kind of
late nineteenth-century decadence which finds its own moral standards when
pressed. Head has the character down, fiddling at a cigarette, twitching at
his cloak.
Elsewhere Simon Chadwick and Debra Beaumont are perfect as the hooray
guests, while Richard Warwick adds commendatorial weight as the victim's
father, Sir Johnstone Kentley.
Hitchcock adapted Hamilton's play in 1948, and it has remained a classic for
exactly the reasons which mark its success here: it is, like Hamilton's
other plays, tense, uneasy and psychologically acute. Hamilton died at 58 in
1962. His neglected fame should hang on more than just Rope.

FT  12 JUL 93 / Arts: Dubious voice of Satan - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Not everything at the Royal Court is wonderful. While David Mamet's Oleanna
is playing to packed audiences in the main house, a much more dubious
production, though also well-attended, is taking place in the Theatre
Upstairs. Gregory Motton's The Terrible Voice of Satan is an example of a
talented playwright losing his way, and one can't help thinking that it was
the Royal Court influence that led him beyond temptation.
Motton was a specialist in the obscure to begin with, as anyone who saw the
recent revival of his A Message for the Broken Hearted at the Battersea Arts
will testify. He can write beautifully, but it is not always clear what he
means nor who or even where his characters are. By the standards of The
Terrible Voice, A Message was a model of clarity. The new play is all over
the place, including under the Irish Sea.
The Court must have some responsibility. Most of its best productions in the
last year or two have been either Irish or American. Yet it can be dangerous
to point indigenous playwrights in foreign directions.
The Court sent the once promising Martin Crimp to New York to learn about
America. He then wrote The Treatment, which showed not a hint of American
subtleties or the American talent for self-parody. In The Terrible Voice
Motton has gone very Irish, but to no great avail.
Irishness apart, the main literary influences on the piece seem to be
Marlowe's Dr Faustus and, even more blatantly, Coleridge's The Ancient
Mariner: modest titles for big works - a practice stood on its head by
Motton. A few lines from Mephistopheles in Dr Faustus say it all: 'Why this
is Hell, nor am I out of it. Thinkst thou that I, who saw the face of God,
And tasted the eternal joys of Heaven, Am not tormented with ten thousand
Hells?' I suppose that's roughly what The Terrible Voice is about. Motton
adds priests, sex, the IRA and a whole lot of gimmicks without moving
forwards. The Ancient Mariner comes in with the albatross, in this case a
magic bird initially huge and finally slung dead, and much diminished,
around the waist of the principal character, Tom, as the boat in the Irish
Sea runs into a storm. Don't forget that the word 'bird' nowadays has more
than one meaning.
The play is very well directed by James Macdonald. There are catching scenes
of miniature cars along a track in a funeral cortege in the background, and
a full-size bicycle in the foreground with strip-tease and simulated sex
somewhere in the middle. Some of the staging draws on the National Theatre's
Carousel.
I wouldn't fault the performances, especially Sean Murray as Tom, but the
play is a terrible fall from grace: Paradise Lost.

How jolly nice of BBC1 to donate a 30-minute commercial to the makers of
'Jurassic Park'. Not that they actually need it, by all accounts, having
already taken tens of millions of dollars at American box offices, but
without the sort of promotion provided by Spielberg And The Dinosaurs (7.00,
just right to catch the primary school audience) how could they be sure of
equal success in Britain?
Subject of Birthrights is the staff of the Chinese restaurants which you now
find in even the most remote corners of Britain, in country town and seaside
resort as well as metropolis. Behind the scenes, we are told, life is not
always easy for the British Chinese. Is your life always easy? (7.40 BBC2)
World In Action is also about food preparation. It asks whether the British
are too reliant on fast food and junk food and whether basic cooking skills
are being forgotten. The answer in each case is 'Yes', so do we really need
to watch? (8.30 ITV).

FT  12 JUL 93 / Arts: Miller's Secret Marriage - Cheltenham Festival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLEMENTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Secret Marriage is the well-made 18th-century opera par excellence,
which established its own niche in operatic history from the very start when
it was encored in its entirety at its first performance. There may be
nothing remarkable in Cimarosa's music, especially for a work six years'
younger than The Marriage of Figaro, or intricate about the development of
the plot. But set up its comic mechanism convincingly and the two acts
unwind with a succession of surefire jokes and persistent good humour.
Opera North's new production, put before the public for the first time at
Cheltenham last Thursday, applies effective enough lubricant to that comic
clockwork. The staging is Jonathan Miller's, and marks the beginning of his
rehabilitation in British operatic life after more than five years of
self-imposed exile since he directed Candide for Scottish Opera in 1988.
After Cheltenham the show repairs to the Buxton Festival, where it will form
one element in a Miller package alongside his production of Donizetti's
Maria Stuarda that opened in Monte Carlo earlier in the year.
With designs by John Conklin (a tastefully marbled, duck-egg blue interior)
and purposeful conducting by Roy Laughlin this Secret Marriage makes a
pleasant, likeable show.
The concept is straightforward enough; the action is transplanted from
18th-century Bologna back to Regency England, to the world in which Colamn
and Garrick set the play from which Cimarosa's libretto was taken.
The opera is sung in very clearly comprehensible English (a new plain
translation by Simon Rees, not without some seemingly unintentional double
entendres); Geronimo takes on a Yorkshire accent you could cut with a knife
' a self-made man from the burgeoning industrial age if ever you saw one '
and Count Robinson becomes another dim example of the English aristocracy,
doubtlessly inbred. It's a sensible, untroubling piece of theatre, carefully
worked out by Miller and perkily rendered by his cast.
Andrew Shore's Geronimo is the latest of his portrayals of bourgeois
bumptiousness, a bumbling cousin to his Don Pasquale; he handles the accent
splendidly, times his entrances and exits perfectly, delivers all his gags
with perfect deadpan. He's well matched against Jonathan Best's guileless
Robinson and Tamsin Dives' bustling Fidalma.
The young people are spiritedly taken. The Elisetta, the American Kate Egan,
was making her British debut; she sings cleanly and cultivates a good mode
of visible disdain. Anne Dawson is a wholesome, perky Carolina and Mark
Curtis a diligent Paolino. All of them are stylish, attentive performers;
the pace is never allowed to falter.

FT  12 JUL 93 / Arts: The country house as time machine - Architecture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN AMERY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This is the time of year for the country house visit. International tourists
and eager National Trust members are paying to glimpse the especially
English ensemble of the great house with its collections and grounds.
Throughout the land a quiet procession threads its way through silent rooms
 -carefully keeping on the right side of the ropes and speaking in awed
whispers. How much do we really see on the country house tour, and how much
do we really understand about what is spread before us ?
The great moment aesthetically in the English house is the eighteenth
century. To assist us with the understanding of this period a valuable new
book has been published - Eighteenth Century Decoration: Design and the
Domestic Interior in England by Charles Saumerez Smith, (Weidenfeld and
Nicolson, Pounds 50). It is the latest volume in the very comprehensive
series that looks at the way interiors are depicted, by collecting together
as much contemporary illustrative material as possible. In the case of the
eighteenth century there are plenty of architects' drawings, pattern books,
paintings and prints that do, when they are analysed, present a clear
picture of life indoors at the time. A careful reading of Mr Saumerez
Smith's book will open the eyes of visitors to country houses and give them
a head start in understanding why the rooms look the way they do and how
they were designed for use.
There is relatively little published in this country that is serious on the
subject of historic interior decoration. Mr Peter Thornton has done a lot to
rectify this and his pioneering book on the seventeenth century interior in
England and Holland set a very high standard. He went on to write the badly
titled but rewarding book, Authentic Decor which updates to an extent the
work of the master, Mario Praz, who gave us the gospel of interior
decoration and its history. Anyone writing about interior design in the
eighteenth century in England has to match the work of John Fowler and John
Cornforth who published the key work in 1974 - English Decoration in the
eighteenth century. Peter Thornton and John Cornforth have tried hard to
show that our aesthetic response to eighteenth century rooms may well be a
response that is conditioned by the current look of rooms and houses that
were all substantially reorganised in 1910.
The author of this important new book uses as his visual sources, paintings,
prints and architects' drawings. The book is a rich visual feast but one of
those books where the reader is really helped by being taken by the hand by
the author and gently guided into new ways of interpreting old visual
sources. When Mr Saumerez Smith is confronted by a painting by Zoffany or
one of Arthur Devis's wooden compositions, he helps us to see them as
documentary sources that reveal a lot about the look of the period. They
also reveal a set of social relationships that need to be carefully
interpreted.
The author must have found it difficult to select from the quantity of
material that exists for the period. He has brilliantly found a great deal
of unpublished material, and his commentary also reveals hidden elements in
familiar images. He is right to comment upon the growth in importance of the
spread of possessions amongst all classes as the eighteenth century
progressed. The developing range of manufactured products enabled a wide
range of people to see their immediate surroundings as expressions of
themselves. The fine arts express this to a degree - especially architecture
which began to organise domestic interiors in terms of display.
One of the best sections of this enthralling book for me was the one devoted
to the impact of the great architect Robert Adam. Adam's career defines the
second half of the eighteenth century. He went on the Grand Tour in the
1750's and met the influential Charles-Louis Clerisseau in Florence from
whom he learned how to study the antique and how to draw. This book shows us
some of the perfect results of this study at Kedleston, Syon, Kenwood and
Home House. Adam understood the complete nature of a room - how to design
walls, floor and ceiling as well as the furniture. Johann Zoffany as a
leading artist and contemporary of Adam also understood the total domestic
realm in his paintings and the examples shown here reveal not just family
life but also the totality of the design of rooms and furniture.
The role of the craftsmen and the pattern books of the period is clearly
explored in a way that rightly emphasises the importance of the skilled
artisan and demonstrates how printed books and engravings helped the spread
of stylistic knowledge from France and Italy to London, and from London to
the provinces.
Above all this book took me into a world of refinement and taste leavened by
satire and the perceptions of Hogarth. I felt by the end that I had lived
briefly in the eighteenth century. I admired Mr Saumerez Smith's learning
and visual sense and I coveted the architectural wallpaper shown in an
interior of 1780 to the extent that I might well consider copying it.

FT  12 JUL 93 / Arts: Fool Moon - New York
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN FRICKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fool Moon is one of the most aggressively insubstantial productions to open
on Broadway recently. It consists of its two multitalented performers, David
Shiner and Bill Irwin, goofing around for two hilarious hours, backed by the
lively 5-piece urban hillbilly band the Red Clay Ramblers.
Irwin, the personality familiar from his tv, film and stage appearances, is
in good-hearted, rubber-bodied form; Shiner, the gangly clown from Cirque du
Soleil's Nouvelle Experience, dominates the evening and is its revelation.
In the spirit of classic vaudeville, there's no semblance of a traditional
plot linking the bits that Shiner and Irwin play out alone and with each
other, the band, and the audience. What almost holds the show together - are
the personae the performers adopt, which signal to the audience that we are
in a clown-land.
Irwin's persona is sweet-faced and bemused, the innocent victim of external
forces, like the weird magnetic pull always threatening to suck him
offstage, and the unseen prankster who yanks the cord every time Irwin tries
to speak into a microphone (neither performer utters a word during the
show.)
Shiner spends most of his time poking fun at audience members. He climbs
over rows of seats to find the marauder in 'his' chair, borrows someone's
camera and then destroys it (not really) and in the evening's funniest
segment, brings people on stage to help him pretend-make a silent movie.
If Fool Moon is 'about' anything, it's how willing people are to follow
Shiner's charismatic lead. Everyone mimes, understanding instantly that his
is a silent world; New Yorkers never seen without hands on their pocketbooks
surrender fur coats and wallets to him; reticent folks end up rolling around
the stage in a passionate mock embrace. Watching others abandon inhibition
is a guilty pleasure.
While Fool Moon's lack of structure lends it a wonderful freshness and
simplicity, the show does feel slightly underconceived and underrehearsed.
Perhaps an outside eye - no director or writer are credited in the
programme, so presumably Shiner and Irwin filled all creative roles
themselves - could have given the show the edge that it needed to become
something more than the charming diversion it is now.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Leeds office of MOWLEM NORTHERN, a division of John Mowlem Construction,
has been awarded contracts together worth Pounds 8.6m. The largest, worth
approximately Pounds 4m, is to convert a listed mill into a school of
computing and mathematics for the University of Huddersfield.
The nineteenth century mill, a six-storey building which remained in working
order until 1988, will be completely stripped and refurbished, together with
an adjacent single-storey weaving shed.
Scheduled for completion in August 1994, the refurbishment will preserve the
character of the mill by cleaning and exposing original features such as
cast iron columns, roof trusses, brick arched floors and solid masonry
walls. It will allow students from the school of computing and mathematics
to relocate under one roof with new facilities such as computer
laboratories, seminar rooms and lecture theatres, including a sunken theatre
for 270 people in the weaving shed.
Other work won by Mowlem includes three design and build projects: a Pounds
1.2m contract from English Industrial Estates for a factory at Hellaby lane,
Rotherham, a Pounds 1.5m contract for a two-storey office development which
will incorporate Hull Housing Action Trust's new headquarters and a
production facility extension for Arco Coatings, both in Hull.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Great Western Resources, the UK-quoted oil, gas and coal company which last
year suffered an unwelcome torrent of publicity over its flamboyant former
chairman Dan Pena, has named two non-executive directors to its already
10-strong board. Donald Clayton and Joseph Reid will be among a team of
eight non-executive and four executive directors.
Howard Wolf, the company doctor who replaced Pena as chairman in 1991
following a shareholder rebellion, says the appointments mark GWR's move
from 'the whisky and society columns to the business pages'.
Clayton, 56, is better known to observers as the driving force behind the
development of Meridian Oil, owned by Burlington Resources of the US, since
1987. In February, Wall Street was taken aback by Clayton's abrupt and
unexplained departure from Burlington, just eight months after being
promoted to president of Meridian's parent company.
Reid, an oil and gas consultant in his early 60s, was Clayton's predecessor
as chief executive of Meridian Oil. He was also president and chief
executive of the natural gas company Superior Oil, taken over by Mobil Oil
in 1984.
GWR, which had been in dispute with one of its largest customers, recently
came out of Chapter 11, a form of protection from creditors supervised by
the courts. The group reported an interim loss of Dollars 2.03m in May,
against Dollars 13.6m the previous year.

FT  12 JUL 93 / Construction Contracts: Hozelock plant for Birmingham
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
HOZELOCK has announced plans for a factory in Birmingham.
Work on the 10 acre site is due to start in August and the new manufacturing
facility - representing an investment of Pounds 8.5m - is expected to be
operational by the autumn of 1994.
It will house all the manufacturing and assembly lines for Hozelock's ranges
of watering equipment, sprayers, garden electrical and housewares products.
The new plant is expected to provide for the planned expansion of the
company into the 21st century. Some 65 new jobs will be created, increasing
Hozelock's Birmingham workforce to 550.
The single-storey building will initially afford 175,000 sq ft of factory
space and has been designed to facilitate easy expansion up to 235,000 sq ft
and for the addition of a mezzanine floor.
'This is a major undertaking which will ensure that we have the facility to
increase our manufacturing capacity to support the company s planned growth
both in the UK and, particularly, the rest of Europe,' said managing
director, David Codling.
Situated at Birmingham's showpiece industrial estate, Midpoint Park on the
A38 trunk road five miles to the north-east of the city, the new factory is
also sited for easy access from the M6 and M42 motorways.
It is also less than a mile from Hozelock's computerised national
distribution centre at Minworth which will further speed deliveries of
finished products to the retail trade.
Work on the 10 acre site is due to start in August and the new manufacturing
facility - representing a total investment of Pounds 8.5m - is expected to
be operational by the autumn of 1994.
Housing all the manufacturing and assembly lines for Hozelock's ranges of
watering equipment, sprayers, garden electrical and housewares products, the
new plant is expected to provide for the planned expansion of the company
well into the 21st century.
Some 65 new jobs will be created, increasing Hozelock's Birmingham workforce
to 550.
The single-storey building will initially afford 175,000 sq ft of factory
space and has been designed to facilitate easy expansion up to 235,000 sq ft

FT  12 JUL 93 / Management: Spot the tricks of the trade - It pays to be
wary of consultants
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER LORENZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Have you ever employed a consultant who turned out to be an organ-grinder, a
Swiss cheese, or a Mercedes? Did he or she 'fake it', use perpetual motion,
indulge in role reversal, or employ the 'CIA approach'?
You may not know it - even less admit it - but you have almost certainly
suffered at the hands of at least one of these phenomena. For they are all
variants of the tricks which management consultants have pulled on their
clients from time to time.
This information comes courtesy of an insider, Michael Grunberg, managing
director of Stoy Hayward Consulting, a medium-sized British firm. Though one
of the slickest talkers around, Grunberg denies that he or his firm use such
tricks of the trade. But he is not ignorant of them.
At a meeting last month of the Strand Group, an informal association of
in-house consultants for large companies in the UK, Grunberg was invited to
give an external perspective of the way consultancy work is bought and used.
In an otherwise serious presentation about the ways in which different
consultancies operate, he threw in two slides which listed 'the stunts they
pull' (with the emphasis on the 'they'). To distance Stoy Hayward further
from such practices, he omitted its logo from the slides.
The first list covered the 'sales cycle' (selling to clients), and described
13 types of misbehaviour. First came the 'organ grinder' - where the team
which does the selling is far more high-powered than the one which actually
carries out the assignment. As most clients would confirm, this is far from
uncommon.
Then there is 'smoke and mirrors': a consultancy claims that its proposed
approach, or course of action, is 'structured, sophisticated and proven',
but in fact it has yet to be tested.
Next come 'gold-plating' (a methodology or activity which is not essential),
and the 'trojan horse': a low-cost exercise calculated to 'front-end'
further work out of the client. Both are more widespread than Grunberg
implied.
Leaping a bevy of other intriguing practices, from 'surgical bypass' to
'barrow boy', one arrives at the Mercedes stunt, where the client receives
only the basic model and everything else is extra. In the Swiss cheese,
consultants leave deliberate gaps in the work they tender, in order to
'facilitate extensions' from the client, as Grunberg put it.
Turning to tricks used when a consultant has bid successfully - by whatever
means - and is executing an assignment, Grunberg defined 'faking it' as
relying on the client's inexperience and lack of knowledge; 'perpetual
motion' as staying on forever; role reversal as training on-the-job at the
client's expense (which is far from uncommon); and the 'CIA approach' as
Consulting in Absentia - sub-contracting the work to others in covert
fashion.
Then there's 'hidden talent' (the exaggeration of per diem work); 'car
service' (the allocation of general overheads as job-specific expenses); and
'carbon copy' - using previous client work without adjusting it. This is one
of the most regular (mal)practices of all, too many clients have learned to
their cost.
Grunberg concluded with a list of tips to clients on how to avoid being
taken to the cleaners in these and other ways. They included: know what you
want to achieve; write it down; identify the real experts; read their
tenders very carefully; evaluate formally and on a range of criteria; and
treat consultants as consultants, not 'terrorists' and negotiate with them,
'especially on the detail of the deliverables'. Above all, 'manage the
consultancy' and measure its success.
Grunberg was too polite to say so, but all that is easier said than done.
You may even need a consultant to advise you how to do it.

FT  12 JUL 93 / Management: A clean break with tradition - There has been a
revolution at Elida Gibbs - from the factory floor to the sales team
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN A business where brands are a company's most cherished assets, abolishing
the post of brand manager may not seem a brilliant idea. Yet last October,
Elida Gibbs, the UK personal products subsidiary of the Anglo-Dutch Unilever
group, did just that. For good measure, it scrapped its sales department,
too.
Instead, the company's brands - which include Faberge Brut, Pears, Signal
and Timotei - are now the responsibility of a new breed of executives known
as brand development managers, while the former sales team has been re-born
as the 'customer development process'.
The title changes are far more than cosmetic. Behind them lies a drive to
shake up traditional methods which has radically transformed the way Elida
Gibbs operates, from research laboratory to supermarket shelf. It is, in
effect though not in name, a thorough 're-engineering' exercise.
Tony Burgmans, director of Unilever's worldwide personal products business,
compares the upheaval with the recent revolution in organisation and working
practices which Japanese competition has forced on western industries such
as cars.
In common with many manufacturers in those sectors, Elida Gibbs has eagerly
embraced concepts such as teamwork, empowerment and total quality. But
unlike them, it has been unable to find inspiration from other companies in
the same business.
The experience has turned it into a testbed for new techniques within the
Unilever group.
The most potent external force for change was not competition from Japan,
but pressure from Britain's big retailers, through which most of Elida
Gibbs' products are sold. By the late 1980s, several felt the company,
though still UK market leader, was failing to keep up with the times.
'Two or three years ago, Elida Gibbs' delivery standards were dire and their
ordering systems archaic,' says Michael Rosen, director of non-foods at J.
Sainsbury, Britain's biggest supermarket group. 'The whole thing was
shambolic. They were nearing the point of losing a lot of business.' Now, he
says, the company is one of Sainsbury's most efficient suppliers.
The route to recovery began on the factory floor. With backing from Mike
Perry, Burgmans' predecessor and now joint chairman of Unilever, Elida Gibbs
introduced team-working at its plant at Seacroft, near Leeds in 1988.
Responsibility for each production line has been transferred to those
working on it, who are encouraged to co-operate continuously to solve
problems and improve efficiency. They are also given fuller information
about the company's performance and overall strategy.
Initially, the switch faced scepticism from trades union officials and older
middle managers. To win acceptance, the company put its 1,000 employees
through three-day courses on total quality, run by teachers selected from
the workforce.
'The changes would have been absolutely impossible to implement without
training - it opened people's minds,' says Jon Riches, personnel director,
who has overseen an increase in the company's training budget from 0.5 per
cent to 1.3 per cent of sales since the late 1980s. This year, he aims to
give every employee 10 days' training.
The new approach has produced some big gains. In the past three years,
change-over time on one production line has been reduced to less than four
hours, from a day and a half, while annual lost-time accidents at Seacroft
have been cut by three quarters.
In parallel, a drive to improve customer service has increased from 72 per
cent to more than 90 per cent the proportion of orders correctly completed.
In the past year, 'right first time' performance at the plant has risen six
percentage points to more than 90 per cent.
The bottom line has benefited, too. Between 1989 and 1991, pre-tax profits
rose by 73 per cent and margins widened from 6.5 per cent to 10 per cent.
Though recession checked the improvement last year, sales grew by 9 per
cent. (see table).
But as experience with the new approach grew, managers became aware it
needed to go still further. They realised that efforts to boost production
efficiency were tackling only one link in a chain which connected every part
of the business.
One result was a new policy towards suppliers. In three years, their numbers
have been cut by more than a third and they have been given more
responsibility for quality control, testing and development. But, the
biggest breakthrough has been the recognition that the traditional division
of the company into separate functions, such as research or distribution,
had become a serious handicap. By compartmentalising management, it was
frustrating efforts to speed up innovation and increase flexibility.
Last autumn, management was re-structured into teams and managers' roles
re-defined on the basis of core business 'processes', such as the supply
chain (manufacturing and logistics) and commercial affairs. These 'seamless
teams', as Burgmans calls them, are intended to involve all parts of the
business in decisions at every stage.
According to Helmut Ganser, Elida Gibbs' chairman, the new brand development
managers are the linchpins of the system. They are the prime movers behind
product innovation and have wide authority to pull together the technical
and management resources they need to see projects through.
To enable them to concentrate on the longer-term business of building
brands, many of the day-to-day dealings with retailers which absorbed much
of the former brand managers' time have been entrusted to the customer
development managers. Their priority is to satisfy growing demands from
large retailers that suppliers work with them to increase the sales and
profits of entire product categories, rather than just push their own
brands.
The teams are said already to have broken down barriers and encouraged wider
participation across the company. Burgmans says group decision-making has
reached the point where 'you often don't know who made a suggestion first'.
In April, Elida Gibbs launched the first product of the new system. An
aerosol deodorant - named Brut Aquatonic - was developed in less than six
months, half as long as would have been needed previously.
Burgmans reckons the development time today could be as little as three
months. But he stresses the biggest advantage of the reorganisation is that
it enables the company to undertake more ambitious projects, rather than
just to keep doing the same things more quickly.
Top managers should get a more precise picture of how the reorganisation is
working when they review it this week. But the real test of its success will
lie in the market - and in the reaction of retailers.
Boots, Britain's largest chemists' chain, says Elida Gibbs now takes a more
co-operative attitude towards developing new product markets: 'We have a
much more satisfactory dialogue than in the past. They now recognise that
retailers are far closer to the consumer than they can possibly be.'
Sainsbury's Michael Rosen praises Elida Gibbs for 'great strides' to improve
distribution and service, but says its sales are still spread across too
many brands, some of which - such as Pears - it has failed to develop fully.
Ganser at least partly accepts the criticism, saying he plans to focus more
support behind fewer brands in future.
But the challenges go beyond the UK. As Unilever integrates its European
operations, Elida Gibbs will need to work more closely with sister companies
on the continent. It already has Europe-wide responsibility for developing
deodorants and a growing share of production is for other European markets.
Not surprisingly, Elida Gibbs' managers are keeping an open mind about the
results of the reorganisation. Says Riches: 'Ask us again at the end of next
year. It is still too early to say we have got it right.'

<TEXT>
Andrew Coppel, who last week took over as chief executive of Queens Moat
Houses, has made his first important appointment. Barry Maiden is to become
finance director of the UK hotel division.
The appointment comes after Coppel decided that the UK part of the business
should be run as a separate company, rather than directed from group
headquarters. The UK business, whose shares were suspended last March, is in
urgent need of new financial and management controls, Coppel says.
Maiden, 43, was finance director of Hilton UK for three years and before
that finance director at Threshers, the drinks retailer.

FT  12 JUL 93 / People: Meehan moves to Mothercare
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mothercare, the children's and babywear retailer that is part of the
Storehouse group, is replacing its finance director.
Mothercare says Paul Ryan, finance director since joining from Budgens, the
supermarket chain, in 1989, has resigned from the group to pursue other
interests nearer to his Leicestershire home.
His replacement is Andrew Meehan, 38, who joins from Sears, where he has
been finance director of the sports and leisurewear division.
Meehan trained as an accountant with Coopers &amp; Lybrand and spent time at
Chase Manhattan and Air Products before joining the Burton Group, where he
held senior financial posts in the Top Man, Principles and Burtons chains.
He joined Sears in 1987 and was finance director of Selfridges department
store before moving to sports and leisurewear.
Mothercare's performance has already started to improve thanks to the reform
programme begun by former Storehouse chief executive David Dworkin, and
being continued by his appointee Ann Iverson, Mothercare's chief executive,
but the programme is less advanced than that at sister chain BHS. Meehan is
expected to work closely with Iverson on strategic planning.

FT  12 JUL 93 / Construction Contracts: New headquarters in Cardiff
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
OSPREY PROJECT MANAGEMENT, the project management company of the Franklin &amp;
Andrews group, has been appointed by NCM Credit Insurance (formerly ECGD),
to project manage its relocation to a new headquarters building in Cardiff.
Osprey's Cardiff office was originally appointed in February 1992 to find
suitable development sites for the building. A site was selected within the
waterside location of Cardiff Bay.
The headquarters, which will be built by developer Grosvenor Waterside, will
cost in the region of Pounds 12m, with a further Pounds 4m being spent by
NCM on the fit-out.
The building, which has been designed by Holder Mathias Alcock, is to be
constructed to an unusual and innovative design which will have a nautical
look to it.
It will employ an environmentally friendly air-conditioning system which is
similar to those used in Scandinavia: it involves displacement ventilation
and chilled beams and this is believed to be the first of its type to be
used in the UK.
The building will be developed by Grosvenor Waterside to house NCM Credit,
who are moving out of the Welsh Office since they became a commercial
organisation in November 1991.
Osprey will provide full project management services: quantity surveying
services on the fit-out contract will be carried out by Franklin &amp; Andrews.
Construction works will commence shortly and completion is set for December
1994 .

FT  12 JUL 93 / Survey of Belgium (6): Symphony of joyful expectations -
David Gardner watches the government tune up for the EC presidency
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WILLY CLAES, the Belgian foreign minister, brings a rare skill to his
presidency of the European Community's Council of Ministers, which Belgium
took over at the beginning of July for six months. He is a conductor of some
repute.
He took up his orchestral baton at an eve-of-presidency concert, kicking off
the Belgian mandate by conducting a rendition of Beethoven's Ode to Joy, the
anthem of the EC. He will no doubt be hoping for its joyful reverberations
over the next six months, as he tries to keep the 12 member states in unison
at a fractious and difficult time in the community's development.
The Belgians are thoroughgoing federalists, at home and on the larger stage
of Europe, where they have always been in the vanguard of the 'ever closer
union' to which the Maastricht treaty commits the Community. But they take
over the EC's rotating management in the wake of two Euro-sceptical
presidencies run by the UK and Denmark, which were strongly marked by these
countries' difficulties in obtaining national assent to Maastricht. The
Belgian presidency's unofficial slogan, reiterated in recent interviews by
prime minister Jean-Luc Dehaene, is 'nothing more, but nothing less' than
the full application of the European Union treaty.
That majority of member states in favour of greater European integration are
looking expectantly to Belgium to relaunch the Europe of Maastricht and
propel it towards what have recently seemed ever more distant goals of
monetary and political union.
Amid a flurry of pre-presidency surmise on how Belgium would try to tilt the
EC balance back towards federalism, the government has dismissed suggestions
that it will seek an early revision of the strict fiscal and monetary
convergence criteria for economic and monetary union (Emu), and flatly
denied that it will push for federalist reforms of EC decision-making ahead
of the constitutional review foreseen by Maastricht for 1996.
By then, up to four new member states should be inside the EC, if enough
Austrians, Swedes, Finns and Norwegians can be persuaded by their
governments that this is worthwhile. Most of the crunch points in the
negotiations with the applicant countries will be reached on Belgium's watch
 -and it will be judged in large part on how it handles them.
More streamlined decision-making, implying less room for national vetoes, is
seen as the inevitable consequence of the EC enlarging to take in new
members. But the present accession negotiations are supposed to get the
applicants in by January 1995 - last month's EC summit in Copenhagen decided
 -with only minor adjustments to EC decision-making.
Mr Claes told the FT it would be 'logical, democratic and fair play' to wait
until the new members were in before discussing more far-reaching reforms.
But he added that the goal of the Community 'is not an economic one but a
political one. We need an open debate and a sincere debate in Scandinavia
and in Austria on this target'. 'Maastricht,' he emphasises firmly, 'is not
an ending point.'
But Mr Claes, a Flemish Socialist in Mr Dehaene's Christian
Democrat-dominated coalition, says his priorities are to speed up the EC
enlargement talks, the fight against recession and unemployment, and
implementing the Maastricht treaty, which should become fully ratified -
Belgium hopes - by September at the latest.
He is seeking to lay modest but solid foundations for the two new 'pillars'
in Maastricht: agreement on two to three areas of its Common Foreign and
Security Policy, and the embryo of a common stance on emigration and asylum
policy as part of the 'third pillar' of co-operation in justice and home
affairs. 'I should think that is more than enough for six months,' he says
with sobriety but clear relish.
EC federalists have been chastened by the backlash against the Community and
the speed of European integration set off by Denmark's initial rejection of
Maastricht just over a year ago. But it is, in any case, fair to say that EC
partners who do not share its longer-term ambitions had always expected
Belgium to run a pragmatic presidency.
'You can take it from me,' says a senior British official intimately
involved in the UK's presidency last year, 'that they will be completely
fair; unlike us, there will be no spin on the ball.'
'It is not wise to exaggerate the possibilities and power of a presidency,'
Mr Claes says. 'We know you need consensus to make progress, and that we are
just the go-betweens.' But while it is only natural after a year of EC drift
for Belgium to discourage high expectations, its presidency faces a series
of challenges going beyond its stated priorities.
Money. Its first task will be to preside over the share-out of Ecu157bn in
EC regional and structural development spending for 1994-99, when all its
partners except tiny, rich Luxembourg are unhappy with Commission plans for
spending it.
Gatt. The Uruguay Round world trade reform talks will come to a head under
the Belgian presidency. Belgium will have to contain growing tensions
between France and its partners over the EC's stance, at a time when the
Belgian government is increasingly sympathetic to the Paris hard line on
farm trade. Mr Dehaene called last November's EC-US breakthrough on cutting
farm subsidies 'a tactical blunder' in a recent interview, saying it had to
be 'corrected'.
EC monetary policy. It falls to Belgium to kick-start the second phase of
Emu, due to start in January with the creation of the European Monetary
Institute, precursor of the European Central Bank foreseen at the third
stage later in the decade. The presidency will have to arbitrate amid
continuing tensions arising from high German interest rates. It will also
have to resolve the competition to host the EMI/ECB, as part of a complex
package locating other EC institutions.
Bosnia. The EC's increasingly bad conscience about not doing enough to
resolve the Bosnian conflict led Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany to
champion lifting the arms embargo on ex-Yugoslavia to allow the Bosnian
Moslems to defend themselves. At Copenhagen, the EC instead said it would
send more troops to defend the Moslem 'safe areas'. Mr Dehaene has
acknowledged that if not enough troops are sent, the embargo issue will come
back.
Beyond this lies a minefield of more mainstream EC business and concerns. On
the environment, for instance, the Belgian presidency will have to arbitrate
in the increasingly ill-tempered row over German waste exports for
recycling, partly by pushing hard to get the stalled EC directive on
packaging waste through. Having introduced its own eco-taxes (green tax)
Belgium is also committed to the planned EC energy tax to combat global
warming. But Britain is flatly opposed to this.
The Belgians will be scrutinised closely, too, to see how well they conform
to the EC's new pledge to be more open in its decision-making.

FT  12 JUL 93 / Survey of Belgium (8): Mr Wallonia pulls the strings /
Profile of Guy Spitaels
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DICK LEONARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GUY SPITAELS, who led the French-speaking Socialist Party (PS) for 10 years
until early last year, can claim to be the most successful leader the party
has ever had. He rescued it from a seven-year spell in opposition, and in
1987 boosted its share of the vote in Wallonia to 44 per cent, the highest
proportion of any Socialist Party in the EC, as he was quick to point out to
any inquirers.
Along the way, he had effectively absorbed the predominantly left-wing
separatist Rassemblement Wallon and eliminated the Belgian Communist Party
as a parliamentary force, in spite of its very moderate programme. His
reward was to be asked to form a government by King Baudouin after the 1987
election, from which his party had emerged as the dominant force, not only
in Wallonia but in the national parliament.
It did not take Mr Spitaels long to discover that the Flemish parties would
not accept him as prime minister. The ostensible reason was that he could
not speak fluent Dutch. Yet Mr Spitaels does not believe that this was the
whole story. 'Even if I had spoken perfect Dutch', he says, 'it would have
made no difference. It is not the fact of not being able to speak their
language that the Flemish object to, it is that, as the majority group, they
feel the job belongs to them.'
He is probably right. Each of the last 11 governments has been led by a
Fleming, and the few post-war administrations led by French-speakers have
been short-lived. Mr Spitaels settled for being the country's chief power
broker, staying outside the government as leader of the PS, but being
consulted by the then prime minister, Wilfried Martens, on important points.
He also chose and effectively controlled the Socialist-led coalitions that
rule the Walloon and Brussels regions and the executive of the
French-speaking community.
Mr Spitaels, 61, had a strict Catholic upbringing, but lost his faith while
studying law and political science at the Catholic University of Louvain. He
subsequently became a professor at Brussels University. He joined the PS at
the age of 29 and became a full-time politician at 42.
There was general astonishment when, shortly after the last general
election, he effectively appointed himself as minister-president of
Wallonia. It was, he later said, a move he had long pondered. After 10 years
of pulling the strings from outside government it was time, he felt, to
assume direct executive authority. Although at an earlier period he had been
a vice-premier and budget and communications minister, it was a sign of the
times that he should choose to head a regional administration rather than
joining the national government.
In the region, as earlier in his party, his easy dominance is universally
acknowledged. His intellectual power and shrewd political judgment give him
a head-start over all possible rivals. The Flemish parties have publicly
lamented that they could find nobody of comparable stature to head the
Flemish regional government.
Wallonia is the poorest of the three Belgian regions, but its standard of
living is more than 90 per cent of the EC average, and it did not qualify
for special assistance from the community. Mr Spitaels's proudest
achievement so far has been to squeeze funds out of the EC for the poorest
of Wallonia's five provinces, Mainaut.
Mr Spitaels may never have quite made it as Mr Belgium, but nobody now
disputes his status as Mr Wallonia.

FT  12 JUL 93 / Survey of Belgium (7): Capital of EC is flying high / A look
at plans to modernise Brussels' airport
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRUSSELS has a state-of-the-art airport. Unfortunately for the thousands of
businesspeople and politicians who use it, the art is late-1950s.
Between 1958, when the terminal buildings were built for the World's Fair,
and 1988, no substantial work was done on the site, apart from the
construction of a small satellite terminal in the late 1970s.
But over the same period the city of Brussels has become the institutional
capital of the European Community and a magnet for international business
travellers and politicians. For these customers - who represent two-thirds
of the 9m or so passengers using the airport annually - the 1958 terminal is
a disappointment: cramped, shabby, and slow.
Perhaps Brussels airport's only advantage over its competitors is its
proximity to the city centre. It can take only 15 minutes to travel by car
from central Brussels to the north-eastern suburb of Zaventem where the
airport is built - but that is more a geographical stroke of luck than a
triumph of airport management, and it is let down by an out-of-date 'City
Express' train link.
Professor Pierre Klees, chief operating officer of the Brussels Airport
Terminal Company since January, admits that the airport's owners - a
combination of the Belgian state and private investors, including the
country's largest holding companies - should have done more to keep the
principal airport of the self-styled capital of Europe up to date.
Now, at last, the long-awaited improvements are being carried out. From the
window of Mr Klees's office, the finger of a long, new pier points out
towards the runways. Once complete, the extensions should allow Brussels to
handle an extra 21m passengers a year - more than tripling the present
capacity of 9.3m, to take account of estimated passenger growth forecasts of
between 4 and 7 per cent a year.
Posters on the approach road to the airport proclaim a completion date of
1993. In fact, following wrangles with contractors, consultants, the
government and the airlines, BATC is now estimating the new terminal, with
23 additional gates, will be open sometime in the second half of 1994. The
company says it will set a formal completion date in September.
The building of the new pier - to be followed, eventually, by a second
parallel pier linked by a tunnel - is the most obvious element of the work
under way, and the one which is creating the most headaches for users of the
airport. But BATC is simultaneously hoping to improve the efficiency of the
existing terminal so that when the wraps come off the new buildings next
year, the entire system will be quicker and easier to use. Automatic
signalling systems will guide drivers to spaces in the airport's car parks,
for example; a new integrated computer network, linking all airport services
in collaboration with the airlines, should speed check-in, border and
security controls; and BATC is also trying to persuade Belgian railways to
upgrade the airport's rail links with Brussels and Antwerp.
The improvements do not come cheap. BATC announced a net consolidated profit
of BFr283m in 1991, after tax, but it has had to raise BFr21bn, several
billion francs more than the original estimates for the improvements,
through a bond issue, to cover the cost of the new work.
Further cash will be needed to bring the new airport into line with the
requirements of the Schengen free-travel agreement, which plans to abolish
passport checks for travellers between nine continental EC countries from
December 1. BATC will be given longer to carry out the work necessary to
segregate intra-European passengers from international passengers, but
Professor Klees still estimates the cost at some BFr1bn.
Despite that, he says there is no way that the airport will rest on its
laurels once the improvements have been made. 'It's very damaging that we
didn't start work like Schiphol (Amsterdam's airport) or Paris 20 years ago.
I think all airports should have work in progress every day,' he says.
The airport's managers are still cautious about what the future holds. In
March, Mr Eric Kirsch, chairman of BATC and chief executive of the state
authority which owns 48 per cent of the group's shares, said that the
analysis of trends in aircraft movements, passenger and freight traffic in
1992 gave reason for 'moderate but definite optimism'.
But he also pointed out that Brussels was just one of a cluster of highly
competitive airports, all attempting to be the hub of international and
intra-European aircraft operations.
Brussels airport is certain to retain its head start over competitors as the
only airport serving the EC institutions, not to mention Nato and a host of
multinational company headquarters sited around Brussels. But an improvement
in Europe's high-speed rail network could draw passengers to other modes of
transport, and even entice them to use other hub airports as a way into
Europe. That would increase the pressure on the new terminal, and could chip
away at BATC's income, based on retail operations (40 per cent), airport
taxes and charges for use of pier facilities (60 per cent).
Eurotunnel, operator of the Channel tunnel, claims a combination of
high-speed train and tunnel will reduce the journey between Brussels and
central London to three and a quarter hours, possibly making the train an
attractive alternative to flying for some travellers.

FT  12 JUL 93 / Survey of Belgium (5): Fashioning federalism - Dick Leonard
discusses the constitutional reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DICK LEONARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT TOOK 30 years of campaigning and the painful assembling of a seven-party
agreement to obtain the necessary two-thirds majority, but in May the
Belgian parliament approved the final steps to turn the country into a
federal state. From now on the national government will be confined to
carefully delineated powers.
These will be largely restricted to foreign affairs, defence, justice,
internal security, taxation and social security. All the remaining
responsibilities, including economic affairs, the environment, education,
cultural affairs, transport, housing, planning, research, agriculture and
foreign trade, will be devolved, or already have been, to three regions
(Flanders, Wallonia and Brussels) and three language communities - Dutch,
French and German.
It has been a step by step process, starting in 1980 when the regions of
Flanders and Wallonia were established. A third self-governing region - for
Brussels - was set up in 1987, when education was transferred from the
national government to the language communities. The constitutional changes
approved in May, which will not take effect until after the next
parliamentary elections, are intended to complete the picture.
The changes foreshadow a considerable overhaul of the national parliament,
which until now has been an unwieldy and not very influential body, with an
almost complete overlap between the powers of the two chambers. Henceforth,
the lower house - the Chamber of Representatives - which will be reduced
from 212 members to 150, will be the main legislative body.
The Senate, the membership of which drops from 174 to 71, will essentially
be a revising chamber. Separate parliaments for Flanders and Wallonia will
be directly elected, as the parliament for Brussels has been since 1987. The
minister-presidents of the three regions will in future be known as prime
ministers. The province of Brabent, the only one which has previously been
bilingual, will be split into two, leaving Belgium with five French- and
five Dutch-speaking provinces.
The main inspirer of the constitutional changes was Wilfred Martens, who was
prime minister almost continuously from 1979 to 1992. Yet it fell to his
successor, Jean-Luc Dehaene, also a Flemish Christian Democrat, to steer the
main changes through parliament, a tricky exercise as his left-centre
coalition fell far short of the necessary two-thirds majority in both
houses.
He managed to get the measures through by a judicious mixture of stick and
carrot. The stick was applied to the four governing parties - two Christian
and two Socialist - who were aware of their unpopularity in the country. A
government defeat would have precipitated an early general election.
The carrots were offered to three opposition parties, each of whose support
was needed. The support of the two Green parties - one for each of the main
language groups - was obtained in return for new ecological taxes. The
moderate Flemish Nationalists were won over by the introduction of a clause
ensuring that residual powers not specifically mentioned in the constitution
should revert to the regions.
Will the new changes stick or do they merely mark a stage in a process
leading inevitably to separation, as in the case of Czechoslovakia? There
are some warning signs, notably the press interview given in May by the
Flemish minister-president, Luc Van den Brande. He foreshadowed a much more
complete autonomy for Flanders, setting a target date of 2002.
Mr Van den Brande is a member of Dehaene's own party, and his interview,
which was applauded by the bulk of the Flemish press, was embarrassing to
the government. Yet the excitement soon died down, and a spontaneous march
in Brussels a few weeks later, in opposition to separatism, drew a vast
crowd.

FT  12 JUL 93 / Survey of Belgium (2): Export fall fuels recession - Economy
hit hard by general EC climate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BELGIUM'S high productivity and export-oriented economy is suffering from
recession among its partners, a sharp downturn at home, and the
unsustainable expense of a huge government debt equivalent to about 125 per
cent of its national output.
Yet it is also well positioned to reap rewards from its franc fort policy,
linking the Belgian franc to the D-Mark. This tie, tenaciously maintained
for the past three years, makes the Belgian government even more determined
to link up in monetary union with its neighbours, especially after the
European currency chaos of last autumn.
From 1988, Belgium enjoyed three years of high, non-inflationary growth,
peak private investment and good corporate profitability, along with big
increases in disposable income. But the more than 4 per cent of gross
domestic product average growth of 1988-90 slowed to 1.9 per cent in 1991
and just 0.8 per cent last year. This year is likely to see a contraction of
about 0.7 per cent, and only a slow pick-up of around 1 per cent of GDP is
foreseen for 1994.
At home, demand has fallen; new car registrations for the first three months
of this year, for instance, were down 19.4 per cent on the same period last
year. But this is more due to the general climate of EC-wide recession and
rising unemployment. In Belgium, there is no 'debt deflation' brake holding
back a rise in consumption as there is in the UK and Scandinavia. On the
contrary, the size and rate of household and corporate savings is high.
The determining factor in Belgium's recession is the slowdown in its export
markets. Its exports are equivalent to about two thirds of its GDP, and
nearly two thirds of its sales abroad are to its neighbours in Germany,
France and the Netherlands, all in recession. In addition, Belgium's
relative dependence on what it earns in the international marketplace is far
greater than any of these main partners; per capita it exports nearly twice
the amount Germany does.
Export success had fuelled high growth, particularly following German
reunification. But the extent of German economic contraction has hit Belgium
hard. Germany 'delayed the recession for Belgium', says Mr Alfons
Verplaetse, the central bank governor.
The poor outlook for exports has led to annual investment growth coming down
from more than 15 per cent three years ago to perhaps minus 2 per cent this
year. Company bankruptcies in the first six months this year reached a
record 3,079, 35 per cent up on the same period in 1991, when the first
signs of a slowdown appeared.
Last year also saw the first volume fall in exports since 1975, and a 1.4
per cent drop in foreign sales at current prices. All this has fed through
into lost jobs, with unemployment rising from 9.3 per cent in 1991, to an
expected 11.9 per cent this year.
With the franc pegged to the D-Mark, a collateral and dangerous problem has
been the higher rate of wage increases in Belgium over the past three years,
creating a 4 per cent wage gap with its three main trading partners. Belgium
is the last EC country (aside from Luxembourg with which it has an economic
union) to retain automatic wage indexation, leading over the past three
years to nominal wage rises nearly twice the rate of inflation, now at
around 2.8 per cent. While wage settlements have generaly been around or
below German levels, the OECD reckons that in 1988-1994, Belgian wages will
have risen by 38 per cent, against 30 per cent in France, and 28 per cent in
the Netherlands.
'The government has been very slow to recognise that problem,' says Mr Peter
Praet, chief economist at Generale de Banque, the leading commercial bank.
'It is very clear that in Belgium we have a very deep crisis, in industrial
employment, not in services,' acknowledges Mr Verplaetse.
A vain attempt to end wage indexation nearly brought Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene's
Centre-Left government down in March. Instead, BFr10bn revenue from fuel
taxes on non-industrial users are to be mobilised to lighten the high social
security charges on employers in the traded goods sector of the economy.
This redistribution of the tax burden - the so-called Maribel plan - should
close about 40 per cent of the wage gap, according to Mr Verplaetse,
provided it can be repeated next year and in 1995.
The other vital ingredients to retain Belgium's competitive edge are wage
moderation and a concerted effort to bring the budget deficit and government
debt under control.
Recent signs that wage settlements were easing are already looking
ephemeral. Most unions at national level had agreed not to seek real wage
increases in 1993-94. But subsequent negotiations at sectoral level have
secured rises - after inflation which is automatically added in - of between
1.4 and 3.4 per cent in 14 industries.
Moreover, the higher fuel charges in the Maribel plan will also go into the
retail price index and therefore back into wages. The plan may not have as
much effect as the authorities foresee in closing the wage gap with
Belgium's competitors.
Public finances have also suffered some drift. The Dehaene government is
vigorously trying to get the deficit under control, through a mix of new
taxes and spending cuts. The near collapse of the government in March over a
BFr110bn budget-cutting package underlined the political sensitivity of the
task.
The turnaround in government finances between 1981 and 1991 was impressive.
Spending was cut from 59.6 per cent to 51.7 per cent of GDP, with revenues
falling modestly from 46.4 per cent to 45.4 per cent. The deficit was
thereby only cut from 13.3 per cent of GDP to 6.3 per cent. The balance of
the budget after interest paid on debt is taken out, however, moved from a
deficit of 5.5 per cent to a 'surplus' of 4.1 per cent. Nevertheless, the
deficit with interest crept up to 6.9 per cent last year - well wide of the
3 per cent target set by the Maastricht treaty for 1996 for member states
such as Belgium determined to be in the first wave of European economic and
monetary union (Emu).
Yet in the coming months the government can call in short-term debt, and
refinance it long term, and in Belgian francs. 'I hope we will see in '94
the real reward for the strong franc policy,' says Mr Praet, who foresees a
saving on the government's interest bill equivalent to 1 to 1.5 per cent of
GDP.
If interest rates in Germany, and therefore Belgium, ease down further,
Belgium should be on target for a deficit of around 5.3-5.5 per cent of GDP
next year.
The authorities have little doubt that they can and must make it into the
first wave of Emu. They point out that the franc became a refuge currency
during last September's chaos in the exchange rate mechanism of the European
Monetary System - with short-term inflows of BFr122bn, or 1.7 per cent of
GDP.
Speculators, they said, ignored the fact that Belgium's current account has
had a surplus of around 2 per cent of GDP since 1985, and that in spite of
the deficit in its public finances, it is a net creditor country through its
high private savings. The brief rise in domestic interest rates during the
March budget cuts and wage indexation crisis was quickly reversed.
In the future, however, the franc could still come under pressure if wage
indexation continues to erode Belgian competitiveness.

FT  12 JUL 93 / Survey of Belgium (4): Green light likely for eco-tax -
Hilary Clarke discusses legislation designed to protect the environment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HILARY CLARKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BELGIUM is set to become the first European country to introduce a green tax
to force consumers to switch to products that have a less damaging effect on
the environment. The so-called eco-tax, at present being debated in the
Belgian upper house, has put the government of Prime Minister Jean-Luc
Dehaene at odds with a range of different industries from plastics and
chemicals to French mineral water producers. If, as seems likely, the tax is
agreed by the senate, it will become operational next year.
The eco-tax was born out of Belgium's constitutional reforms, the bulk of
which were agreed last February. To obtain a necessary two-thirds majority
in parliament for its sweeping constitutional changes which will federalise
the country, the government needed the support of opposition Flemish Agalev
and French-speaking Ecolo parties. The ecologists, who between them have 18
members of parliament, seized the opportunity and said they would back the
government's plans only if it agreed to the eco-tax.
Industry claims the eco-tax will put up new barriers to trade and is out of
step with environmental legislation designed to cut domestic packaging waste
in the European Community. Belgium's trade unions, which originally backed
the tax, have now joined the employers' protest because they fear it could
result in huge job losses.
The experimental tax will be applied to a selected group of consumer items
including disposable cameras and razors, paper with less than a certain
amount of recycled fibre and domestic chemical products such as weed
killers, pesticides and glue. Beer and wine bottles, soft drink cans and
water bottles will also be taxed a maximum of 15 francs a litre. Batteries
and throw-away razors will have a levy of 10 and 20 francs respectively.
Leading the battle against the tax are the plastics and chemicals
industries. PVC bottles are the only product which will automatically be
taxed the maximum 15 francs a litre in a bid to gradually abolish PVC
production altogether. 'PVC is the most recycled material in Belgium today.
It is clear there is a prima facie discrimination against PVC,' said
Jean-Marie Chandelle, head of corporation communications with Belgium's
largest PVC manufacturer, Solvay.
French water manufacturers have joined the Belgian plastic industry in their
protest as the majority of plastic-bottled water in Belgium is imported from
France. The French government has lodged an official complaint against the
tax with the Belgium authorities. For its part, the plastics industry has
complained to the European Commission that the tax discriminates against
PVC.
But the tax has also angered a broad range of Belgian industry. 'We are not
against the principle of imposing a levy on a product to correct damage done
to the environment, but we are against an arbitrary and general taxation the
proceeds of which will not be used for cleaning up the damage the product
has done,' said Georges Jacobs, head of the Belgian Industry Federation.
Belgium's eco-tax differs from packaging waste schemes already introduced in
other EC countries because it will be high enough to change consumer habits
and influence distributors' choice in packaging, rather than raising revenue
for waste management investment.
Environment has been the responsibility of Belgium's regional governments
since 1980. Revenue from the eco-tax will be distributed to the Brussels,
Flanders and Walloon authorities who will have control over its spending.
The Belgian employers' organisation says there is no guarantee that money
raised, an estimated BFr22.5bn on plastic bottles alone, is used for waste
management and environment corrective projects. Doubts have also been raised
over how the tax will be collected, although the Greens say the additional
administration will be worth it because of the knowledge to be gained on
consumer behaviour with regard to the environment.
Following the outcry from industry against the proposals, it was agreed to
establish a follow-up commission to examine the impact of the tax, part of a
last-minute trade-off between the government and the Greens during their
negotiations over the eco-tax. The government-appointed body will have
considerable power to modify the law, including waiting until June 1994
before setting final tax levels.
Resigned to the fact that the eco-tax will be introduced in Belgium in some
form or other, Belgian packaging users, manufacturers and raw material
producers are developing their own alternative packaging waste reduction
programme, Fost-Plus, which will be based on Germany's Dual-System scheme.
Under the Fost-Plus plans, distributors will pay a levy into a government
fund which will be pumped back into industry-run waste management schemes.
Industry hopes to persuade the Greens to adopt this system.
Whether the ecologists can be persuaded to do this is uncertain. 'An
essential element of green thinking is product policy, not just the
production process. What's the point of a clean factory that makes polluting
products?' asks Agalev member Chris Vermeeren, who helped draft the eco-tax
legislation.
Industry's other plan of attack is via the European Community. 'We hope the
European Commission will at least object to the discriminatory clause
against PVC,' said Nancy Rusotto of the Association of Plastic Manufacturers
in Europe.

FT  12 JUL 93 / Survey of Belgium (1): Euro-devotee calls the tune - As it
assumes the presidency of the European Community this month, Belgium is
embarked on a course towards a more federalist structure at home. It sees
Europe as an anchor for its own political and economic restructuring
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER

<TEXT>
IT IS HARD to imagine any European Community country other than Belgium
decreeing a reduction in jail sentences for convicted prisoners to mark its
assumption this month of the EC's presidency. Idiosyncratic though the
gesture seems, it illustrates the importance Belgium attaches to Europe, and
to its place in it.
Belgium, always in the vanguard of Euro-federalism and in the throes of
settling down to a more federalist structure at home, takes over management
of the Community after a year which has seen a backlash against the
Maastricht treaty on political, economic and monetary union, in a number of
European countries.
It intends to set a new tone, banking on ratification of the treaty in the
UK and Germany by around September. Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, the burly Flemish
Christian Democrat who heads Belgium's four-party Centre-Left coalition,
repeated in several eve-of-presidency interviews that over the next six
months he is setting the EC's compass to go 'not a step further than
Maastricht, but towards all of Maastricht'.
Mr Dehaene, is quite likely to call a special autumn summit after treaty
ratification, with Franco-German backing. The intention would be to relaunch
the EC: the practical goal would be to agree the rules, management and
location for the European Monetary Institute. This is the precursor to the
European Central Bank envisaged for later this decade under the plans for
economic and monetary union (Emu) which lie at the heart of Maastricht. It
must be in place by next January to launch the second stage of Emu.
Mr Dehaene and his colleagues remain convinced of the need for Maastricht
and the viability of Emu. They are determined to use their presidency to
raise the EC flag from political half-mast, where it has scarcely fluttered
for the past year, as first the British and then the Danes held the
Community presidency.
They see Europe as an anchor for Belgium's own federalism and as offering a
pretext for re-ordering its economy, especially to put its public finances
right. Mr Dehaene told the Spanish daily, El Pais, recently that Belgium's
European and domestic federalisms 'are complementary and indissolubly
linked'. Yet, Belgian politicians often give the impression that they
believe their linguistically fragmented country - divided between
French-speaking Wallonia, Dutch-speaking Flanders and polyglot Brussels -
can only survive as a nation-state within firm supranational structures
provided by growing EC integration.
That is 'taking it a step too far,' counters Mr Willy Claes, foreign
minister and a Flemish Socialist, but he happily acknowledges that, 'we have
always been in favour of transfers of national sovereignty towards a
supranational body,' and that 'there is a link going in the other
direction'.
Under a seven-party deal in May, Belgium devolved national sovereignty
downwards to an extent that will make it one of the most completely
federalised states in the EC after its next elections. The state will retain
control of foreign policy and defence, justice, taxation and social
security, but other matters, from the environment to education, and from
trade to transport, will be the responsibility of the three regional
executives and their directly elected parliaments.
Securing decisions in Belgium will then become almost as arduous as getting
the EC 12 to agree, but, local politicians emphasise, they will have a firm
consensus underpinning them, and a comfortable EC umbrella above. It will,
moreover, by then have an advisory committee of the regions, an arrangement
which Belgium is convinced is the embryo of a 'Europe des regions'.
That is one reason why widespread predictions in May that Belgium was
heading for a Czech/Slovak-style divorce appear alarmist. A provocative
statement at the time by Mr Luc Van den Brande, Christian Democrat chief of
the Flemish executive, predicted that federalisation would lead to complete
autonomy for Flanders within the decade. Recent opinion polls, however, make
it clear that only 6 per cent of Belgians, and even only 9 per cent of
Flemings, favour separation. The majority backs a federalist solution.
So-called Belgo-Belge scraps between Dutch and French-speakers are
increasingly less melodramatic, partly because of this, partly because
politicians from all parties are deeply unpopular - and want to stave off
elections as long as possible - and also because Belgium has moved into
recession.
In the view of leading economists, such as Mr Peter Praet of Generale de
Banque, the separatism debate has the merit of focusing attention on
Belgium's structural shortcomings, such as its fast-rising social security
bill, in both Flanders and Wallonia.
The government is struggling against a serious imbalance in public finances,
with a budget deficit of 6.9 per cent last year and a government debt
overhang equivalent to nearly 125 per cent of national output. Excluding
interest on the debt, the budget is in surplus. The government is poised to
stem part of the interest payment haemorrhage by refinancing short-term
foreign borrowings into long-term debt denominated in Belgian francs.
That should produce a sizeable reward - perhaps a 1.5 percentage points of
gross domestic product saving on the interest bill - for its three-year old
franc fort policy of tying the franc to the D-Mark.
Convinced it can reach the 3 per cent of GDP target budget deficit for Emu
laid down by Maastricht, Mr Dehaene pushed through a BFr110bn tax and cuts
package in March, at the cost of the near-collapse of his government. The
government also expects BFr25bn this year and next from a four-year
privatisation drive which is expected to net BFr70bn. This will put up for
sale assets ranging from the CGER/ASLK banking and insurance group, to
Belgacom, the state telecommunications company.
Though Belgium is as much out of step with the Emu criteria as the UK, Italy
or Spain, the Belgian franc became a refuge currency, in the currency mayhem
of last autumn, and did not have to leave the exchange rate mechanism, the
EC's currency grid, or devalue. This was a tribute to the credibility of its
monetary policy, and Belgium's perceived status as part of the hard core EC
currency zone, encompassing Germany, France and the Benelux countries.
With other partners gaining competitive advantage through devaluation,
Belgium has to stay within this hard core, to which it sells three fifths of
its exports, but it is failing to bear down on indexed and inflationary wage
settlements which are blunting its competitive edge. It has opted instead to
use revenue from new taxes on non-industrial fuel users to cut employers'
social security payments in the exports sector. This will not be enough,
however, to close a widening wage gap with its main partners.
In Belgium, these strains strengthen the attraction of Emu's goal of a
single currency, and even of an earlier locking of parities between the hard
core countries, once Maastricht is ratified. The latter idea, canvassed by
Euro-federalists, is that a fuite en avant by the stronger economies would
establish a target at which weaker partners could aim later.
'I'm in favour of that,' says Mr Alfons Verplaetse, the respected governor
of Belgium's central bank, 'but I don't think it will happen. This recession
could be longer than we think.'
Mr Praet says locking parities would be dangerous while there was
uncertainty about what was going to happen in a year's time in Germany.
'When growth resumes, maybe we can try something more audacious,' he adds.
But the longer-term goal of full EC monetary union still looks like a haven
to Belgium. As Mr Claes expresses it: 'When there are monetary changes in
Washington we feel it across the European continent. Are we still not ready
to face up to the lessons of the monetary instability of last year, which
not one member state was able to resist by itself?'

FT  12 JUL 93 / Economics: Further drop likely in inflation
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
This is a busy week for economic indicators, particularly in the UK where
data relating to May and June are due out.
The figures are likely to show that inflationary pressures remain light,
with further falls in average earnings and underlying inflation. Special
attention will be paid to Thursday's unemployment figures which may record
their fifth successive monthly decline although even after four
month-on-month drops, economists are not convinced that the jobless total
has peaked.
Further gains in UK manufacturing output are expected for May, but they are
likely to be more modest than in April, when output rose a strong 0.7 per
cent month-on-month.
In the US, analysts are expecting encouraging reports on inflation. Sharp
falls in crude oil, heating oil and tobacco prices are expected to push the
overall level of producer prices downwards.

FT  12 JUL 93 / The Week Ahead: US growth expected to boost Tomkin
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
RESULTS DUE
Tomkins, the UK conglomerate, is expected to report profits of Pounds 174m
and earnings of 13.5p in the year to May today. This compares with Pounds
132.1m and 12.7p a year earlier. Growth is expected to have been driven by a
stronger performance in the US and for the first time will include profits
from Ranks Hovis McDougall, the milling and baking group it bought last
year.
MFI, the furniture group, is expected to report a fall in pre-tax profits
today to about Pounds 43m, from Pounds 66.1m last year. Analysts downgraded
their profits forecasts at the half-year results in January, when MFI said
trading had declined sharply after Black Wednesday damaged consumer
confidence.
It also said sales had been down year-on-year in the first five weeks of its
10-week new year sale, which usually accounts for about 30 per cent of
annual turnover.
The Rank Organisation announces half-year results on Thursday, with pre-tax
profits expected to be at or below last year's Pounds 94m. Some forecasts
are as low as Pounds 82m, based on a poorer performance from Rank Xerox.
The first half is not a good guide to the performance of Rank's
directly-managed businesses - such as holidays, video duplication and bingo
 -where profits tend to come in the second six months. More eagerly awaited
will be statements on current trading. Few expect anything definitive on the
group's future relationship with Rank Xerox.
Great Universal Stores, the UK's largest mail order company, which reports
on Thursday, is forecast to lift pre-tax profits from Pounds 441.5m to
between Pounds 465m and Pounds 470m. The dividend is expected to rise from
40p to 43p.
Analysts believe the company will have benefited from a increase in
mail-order buying, while its market share continues to rise.

FT  12 JUL 93 / Ex-BA adviser fights back
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR BRIAN BASHAM, who was sacked at the start of the year as public relations
adviser to British Airways for his part in the alleged dirty tricks campaign
against Virgin Airways, has launched a campaign to clear his own name and
embarrass Sir Colin Marshall, BA's chairman.
His campaign brings him into conflict with one of his oldest rivals, Sir Tim
Bell, who succeeded him as BA's PR adviser and is best known for his close
relationship with Lady Thatcher.
Mr Basham has submitted four questions to be answered at BA's annual
meeting, which he has reproduced in a letter to Sir Colin. Mr Basham
believes that BA's account of Sir Colin's role in the dirty tricks campaign
has been misleading and he is demanding an independent inquiry into the
affair.
He admits that he commissioned research into Virgin and spoke to journalists
about Mr Richard Branson's airline but he denies that this was improper. He
was not, however, involved in BA's use of computer data about Virgin
passengers, which BA has admitted was wrong and has caused greatest concern
to Mr Branson.
The BA board has also denied involvement in this misuse of Virgin passenger
information, which was said to have been carried out by junior BA staff.
Mr Basham says in his letter to Sir Colin that 'it remains entirely
implausible to me . . . that you could not have known' of the misuse of
computer data.
He also alleges that Mrs Gail Redwood, the company secretary, offered her
resignation after directors signed a disclaimer denying all knowledge of the
alleged dirty tricks campaign.
Mrs Redwood yesterday refused to comment, but BA said that Mr Basham had
misunderstood what had happened. BA said that Mrs Redwood offered to resign
because she wanted to work part-time but felt the company might not agree to
this change.
Her resignation offer was in no way connected to the signing of the dirty
tricks disclaimer, BA said.
In the event, Mrs Redwood was persuaded to continue working for the company
full time.
BA's annual meeting will be held tomorrow at London's Barbican theatre. The
company has received questions from 2,000 shareholders, a third of which
relate to the Virgin affair.

FT  12 JUL 93 / Field calls for pensions switch
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR MP Mr Frank Field says the government should abandon the basic state
pension and instead make employers contribute 6 per cent of gross earnings
to private schemes on their employees' behalf.
Mr Field, chairman of the Commons social services committee, presents his
views in a Fabian Society pamphlet published today, in which he suggests
that in turn, employees would have a duty to make contributions of 4 per
cent of gross salary.
Mr Field described the paper as 'an attempt to break out of the Beveridge
mould which has controlled the left's debate on welfare reform for the
entire post-war period'.
The paper proposes that pension administration and fund management would be
taken over by the companies which now provide personal pensions, such as
life assurance companies, as well as banks, building societies and friendly
societ-ies.
Government involvement would be limited to making contributions to the
private pensions of four groups receiving little or no income - full-time
and part-time carers, parents caring for their young children, the disabled
and the unemployed. These contributions would be linked to average earnings.
The private providers would undertake to give a 'guaranteed minimum
pension', 20 per cent above the current level. This could be clawed back
from wealthier pensioners, according to a sliding scale, if their additional
contributions enabled them to add significantly to the guaranteed minimum.
Significant tax changes would be made, with both employers' and employees'
national insurance contributions reduced. Pension lump sums, currently
tax-free, would be taxed to bring them in line with income paid to
pensioners while in the long term, pension funds would lose their tax
privileges (including grossed-up premiums) to create a 'level playing field'
with other long-term savings products such as unit and investment trust
saving schemes.
Mr Field would also strengthen regulation of the pensions industry by
requiring companies to produce a standard card showing how much customers
would pay in fees each year, and by moving to a fixed-fee system for
brokers.

FT  12 JUL 93 / Nadir set to meet president of northern Cyprus
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ISTANBUL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR ASIL NADIR, the fugitive businessman, was due to meet Mr Rauf Denktash,
president of northern Cyprus, last night for the first time since he fled
the UK in May. Their meeting comes amid further signs that the regime of the
Turkish-occupied part of the island is co-operating to block the efforts of
UK administrators to Polly Peck International.
On Friday, the finance ministry announced that a pharmaceutical plant
belonging to Polly Peck International, Mr Nadir's former company, would be
auctioned to settle debts owed to the north Cypriot regime, which says it is
owed a total of TL43bn (Pounds 2.6m) in unpaid debts to the local social
security agency.
The administrators were earlier close to concluding the sale of ICP, the
drug company, and had convened a shareholders meeting for July 27 in a step
to replace Mr Nadir as a director.
Local lawyers say the regime's latest move is seen as further collusion with
Mr Nadir to frustrate the sales of the assets in northern Cyprus - one of
the last hopes of raising cash for the 23,000 PPI creditors, who are owed a
total of Pounds 1.3bn.
In London last week, in a move aimed at winning over the northern Cyprus
authorities, Mr Christopher Morris of Touche Ross, one of the three UK
administrators, formally apologised to the Turkish Cypriot Central Bank over
allegations of fraud and money-laundering made in a suit against the bank
and other plaintiffs in October 1991.
The administrators last week met finance ministry officials in Nicosia,
northern Cyprus, hoping to win a breakthrough in efforts to gain access to
the local companies.
Mr Nadir was expected to meet both Mr Denktash and Mr Dervis Eroglu, prime
minister, at a party last night to celebrate the fifth anniversary of
Kibris, Mr Nadir's Turkish-language newspaper.
Local company officials say the regime had earlier discussed a plan with the
administrators whereby the administrators would repay the social security
debts in return for limited access to the local companies to prepare a sales
prospectus. However, since Mr Nadir fled to the island in May, all talk of
disposals has been put on hold.
Since PPI went into administration in October 1990, local officials have won
23 separate court actions to block the administrators.

FT  12 JUL 93 / BP mothballs Baglan Bay ethylene production line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BP CHEMICALS intends to shut down nearly half its ethylene capacity at
Baglan Bay, near Port Talbot in South Wales.
It plans to close the smaller of its two production lines at the site
indefinitely.
The decision will remove about 150,000 tonnes a year of ethylene from a
European market which, according to BP Chemicals, is suffering from
significant over-capacity and poor demand and prices. Ethylene is the raw
material for most plastics.
The line will not be restarted in October, after the two - with a combined
capacity of 330,000 tonnes a year - are shut down for maintenance in
September.
BP says there will be no implications for its 900 staff at the complex,
which is one of the largest employers in the region. The closed line will be
kept operable in case demand and prices improve.
Mr Stephen Pettit, chief executive for petrochemicals at BP Chemicals, has
admitted the site is the division's most marginal. But it is reluctant to
close the complex completely.
The remaining production line, with a capacity of about 180,000 tonnes, will
continue to provide ethylene for downstream activities including ethanol,
vinyl acetate, styrene and isopropanol.
Most European ethylene manufacturers are not covering their cash costs
because of poor prices. Two new complexes - BP's 350,000 tonnes a year
expansion at Grangemouth and EniChem's 360,000 tonnes a year plant at
Brindisi - have taken European capacity to 18.5m tonnes a year, aggravating
the supply position further.

THE Church of England will today be warned about the increasing financial
difficulties it faces.
The Church Commissioners report to the Church's general synod in York will
tell parishes that they must prepare to meet a far bigger proportion of
clergy stipends. The commissioners now finance an average of 41 per cent of
stipends but this is likely to fall below 30 per cent by 1996.

FT  12 JUL 93 / Forecast of Pounds 3bn rise in personal tax
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT is expected to raise an additional Pounds 3bn from direct
personal taxation in November's Budget, according to the Ernst &amp; Young
Independent Treasury Economic Model.
Item says the tax increase could be achieved by a rise in the ceiling for
national insurance contributions but it believes Mr Kenneth Clarke, the
chancellor, will rule out further indirect tax rises or increased company
taxation for fear of damaging the UK's competitive economic position.
Its study published today says the biggest problem facing Mr Clarke over the
next few years is the transformation of the country's net overseas assets,
worth Pounds 110bn in 1987, into net debts by next year.
Mr Brian Pearce, Item chief economist, said the UK's overseas assets had
been steadily eroded by large deficits on the current account of the balance
of payments.

</HEADLINE>

   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUSINESS IN the financial services sector strengthened during the last three
months with insurance brokers, securities traders and fund managers enjoying
the sharpest increases in activity, Emma Tucker writes.
A survey by the Confederation of British Industry and Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the
chartered accountants, found that increases in profitability had led to a
rise in optimism for the third successive quarter.
About 300 companies took part in the survey. Only life insurers and venture
capitalIsts reported declines in business volume, although business levels
remained below normal for banks and building societies.
A survey from the Finance and Leasing Association today shows that leasing
rose by 26 per cent in the three months to May, compared with the same three
months a year ago, and that hire purchase was up 8 per cent.

FT  12 JUL 93 / Thatcher renews attack on Maastricht
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TORY arguments over Europe resurfaced last night as Lady Thatcher said she
would back moves in the Lords to win a referendum on Maastricht, and the
government's difficulties in a Commons vote later this month appeared to
deepen.
Lady (formerly Mrs Margaret) Thatcher, the former prime minister, intends to
speak when the House of Lords debates the referendum amendment on Wednesday.
But yesterday she denied her intervention would amount to an attack on Mr
John Major.
'It will be a furtherance of what I have believed in for a very long time,'
she said, adding that she had 'never' sought to damage her successor as
prime minister. 'That is the interpretation put on every time I speak. That
is why I speak very rarely.'
Government business managers are confident that her call for a referendum
will be comfortably defeated by peers. But there is more nervousness about
debates in the Commons and the Lords on Maastricht's social chapter,
expected to be held on July 26.
Mr Bill Cash, Tory MP for Stafford and a prominent opponent of Maastricht,
indicated yesterday that he might vote for the social chapter in the hope of
it wrecking the treaty legislation.
The government, which fiercely opposes the social chapter, agreed to hold
the debates as a concession during the bill's passage through the Commons.
Technically the government could ignore the result if the Commons voted for
the social chapter, but Labour would claim a moral victory if ministers went
ahead with ratifying the treaty without the social chapter.
Although he also opposes the social chapter, Mr Cash said it was 'certainly
on the cards' that he would join Labour MPs on July 26. 'It would not be
voting for Labour. It would be voting against a cosmetic exercise which is
going to happen anyway,' Mr Cash said.
Business managers believe that many Euro-sceptics will be under pressure
from constituency associations not to vote for the social chapter. They are
also hoping that the support, or abstention, of the nine Ulster Unionist MPs
will avert an embarrassing government defeat.

FT  12 JUL 93 / MPs go shopping among rival plans for Sunday trade: Neil
Buckley explains why the issue has prompted a highly unusual move by the
government this week
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BATTLE over Sunday trading in England and Wales will enter a new phase
this week when the government publishes its long-awaited options bill on
Tuesday.
About 145,000 shops already flout the 1950 Shops Act by opening on Sunday.
Many councils have long since given up trying to prosecute them, even though
a European court ruling in December upheld their right to enforce the law.
The government's determination to sort out the issue is demonstrated by its
decision to take the highly unusual step of giving MPs four choices. They
will be allowed a free vote in the autumn session of parliament to decide
which of the options forms the basis of new legislation.
The issue has caused deep rifts among retailers, as large sums of money are
at stake. The John Lewis Partnership says upholding the law and refusing to
open on Sundays costs its Waitrose grocery chain Pounds 1m a week in lost
sales.
Many retailers do not want to be forced by competition to open on Sundays,
as they say the extra costs are not compensated for by sales.
The options that will be presented to MPs are already well known, as they
are largely based on proposals from different lobby groups. They are:
Total deregulation, allowing all shops to open on Sundays, as in Scotland.
Partial deregulation, based on the proposals of the Shopping Hours Reform
Council. This would allow shops below 3,000 sq ft unrestricted opening, but
larger shops could open for only limited hours, say from 10am to 4pm. This
option is supported by the big supermarket chains including Sainsbury and
Tesco, and retail group Kingfisher, which includes the Woolworths, Comet,
B&amp;Q and Superdrug chains.
Limited opening, based on the proposals of the Retailers for Shops Act
Reform (RSAR). Food and convenience shops of less than 3,000 sq ft, as well
as DIY shops and garden centres, would be allowed to open on Sunday. Banks,
building societies, estate agents and travel agents could also open. Other
shops would be barred from opening except for the last four Sundays before
Christmas. The option is supported by some of the UK's largest retailers,
including Marks and Spencer, Burton, Gateway and House of Fraser.
Limited opening, based on proposals of the Keep Sunday Special campaign
(KSS). This is the same as the RSAR option, except that it would not allow
all retailers to open for the last four Sundays before Christmas, nor would
banks, building societies, estate agents and travel agents be permitted to
open. This option is supported by many smaller retailers.
The publication of the bill is likely to be only the start of an intense
round of lobbying and dispute among retailers. The large food retailers have
already attacked the RSAR proposals for ignoring the wishes of consumers.
The KSS is also angry at the late entry of the RSAR into the debate, with
proposals which are similar to its own. It fears the move may split the vote
among MPs who support limited opening.
One area of continuing debate is likely to be worker protection.
The bill is expected to give the right to refuse to work on Sundays,
whatever option is chosen, to existing employees. But the KSS is demanding
this should be extended to all future retail employees.
It is also calling for double-time payments for Sunday working. The Shopping
Hours Reform Council has also called for unspecified 'premium' payments for
Sunday working, but the bill is expected to make no reference to this.
Intense debate is also likely to surround the voting system, which is yet to
be determined, with retailers and campaign groups anxious to see a system
that gives each option a fair chance of being adopted.

FT  12 JUL 93 / Smith concedes point on voting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN SMITH, the Labour leader, yesterday confirmed that he is prepared to
accept individual trade union members continuing to have a say in the
election of future party leaders.
However, in spite of a fresh attack from Mr John Edmonds, leader of the GMB
union, Mr Smith refused to back down on the central point of his
confrontation with union leaders - that Labour parliamentary candidates
should be selected on the principle of one member one vote.
Mr Smith rebuffed suggestions that his concession on the election of the
leader and deputy leader amounted to a climbdown. He said on BBC television:
'It is not a case of giving way on anything, it is a case of finding the
best system for doing it.'
Labour party officials also played down the importance of Mr Smith's
comments, saying any Labour leadership contest was a long way off. But by
agreeing to union members voting for the party leader Mr Smith risked
encouraging union leaders to believe he would also make concessions on the
selection of parliamentary candidates.
With his stand against the unions regarded in the Labour movement as an
increasingly important test of leadership credentials, Mr Smith argued that
the dispute over candidate selection was different because union members
would be 'part of a team' in a local constituency association.
Labour's national executive will decide next Monday on proposals to reform
the party's links with unions which will be presented to the Labour
conference in the autumn. On Wednesday the party's union links committee
will consider the results of consultation on the planned reforms.
To the irritation of the Labour leader's aides, Mr Edmonds said that Mr
Smith was taking bad advice from members of the shadow cabinet and
complained about 'patronising' letters sent to constituency parties by
senior Labour MPs about the future of the block vote.

FT  12 JUL 93 / Ministers act to head off BR defeat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT sought yesterday to avert another possible defeat over
British Rail privatisation in the Lords by saying that an opposition attempt
to challenge the legislative procedures being used would not delay the
sell-off.
Department of Transport officials said the Liberal Democrat amendment would
only create uncertainty for BR pensioners.
Labour and Liberal Democrats have seized on the amendment as a fresh chance
to wreck the sell-off following the government's defeat last week on a
proposal to allow BR to bid for franchises.
The amendment's effect would be to force ministers to adopt rules for
'hybrid' bills - bills combining changes in public policy with changes
affecting private individuals - when BR pension provisions are altered.
That would mean a lengthy consultation process before changes to the pension
schemes could be implemented. Lord Tordoff, the Liberal Democrats' spokesman
in the Lords, said the amendment could attract the support of some Tory
peers.

FT  12 JUL 93 / Jaguar move played down
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SPECULATION that Ford intends to switch production of Jaguar cars to plants
in North America was played down by the US motor manufacturer at the
weekend, in spite of visits by Jaguar executives to Ford plants in Ohio and
Michigan.
Executives at Ford's Dearborn headquarters are trying to dampen reports in
the US that the company has decided to build the new 'small' Jaguar, the
X200, on the same body platform as new US Ford and Mercury models. Jaguar, a
Ford subsidiary since 1989, is due to start production of its new model in
1998 - at the same time as the new US cars.
Officials in Britain and the US said no decision had been made about whether
to base the Jaguar on a Ford body platform or to develop one specifically
for the Jaguar. They said visits by Jaguar engineers to US plants were aimed
at developing further co-operation between Ford's luxury car plants and
Jaguar's in the UK.
Mr David Boole, Jaguar's public affairs director, said a decision on where
to build the new Jaguar 'is at least 18 months away'.
Jaguar engineering and production teams have been relatively frequent
visitors to Ford's plants at Lorain, Ohio, which makes the sporting
up-market Thunderbird model, and at Wixom, Michigan, where the Lincoln
luxury car range is produced.
Jaguar executives in the UK readily acknowledge that production and
management systems at Jaguar's Browns Lane manufacturing plant have already
benefited from the liaison with the US plants.

THE Church of England will today be warned about the increasing financial
difficulties it faces.
The Church Commissioners will tell parishes that they must prepare to meet a
far bigger proportion of clergy stipends. The commissioners now finance an
average of 41 per cent of stipends but this is likely to fall below 30 per
cent by 1996.
The commission's report to the church's general synod meeting in York will
be the first presented by Sir Michael Colman, chairman of Reckitt &amp; Colman
and the recently appointed first church estates commissioner.

THE STOCK EXCHANGE is considering publicising companies which fail
adequately to explain reasons for divergence from the Cadbury code on
corporate governance.
It has all but ruled out the ultimate sanction of de-listing any companies
that do not provide a statement of compliance with the code, which was
published in December. But it may circulate lists of companies which have
not complied and highlight individual accounts which do not include a
statement.
In a separate move it has written to quoted companies to modify the
implementation date for compliance with the code.
Companies will only be required to comment on compliance with the code from
the period between June 30 - the Cadbury implementation date - and their
year-ends.

FT  12 JUL 93 / Brooke hesitant over ITV ownership rule changes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR PETER BROOKE, the national heritage secretary, will tell the Commons
today that he has yet to make up his mind on whether ITV ownership rules
should be relaxed.
There are growing signs, however, that the government is unenthusiastic.
Speculation that the government might allow the nine largest ITV companies
to take each other over - at present forbidden by the 1990 Broadcasting Act
 -has led to rocketing ITV share prices.
The expection of change lay behind Granada's recent decision to spend about
Pounds 84m acquiring a 20 per cent stake in London Weekend Television.
Mr Brooke will make it clear today during national heritage questions that
he is being very cautious. A formal decision is unlikely before September.
The National Heritage Department is reluctant to make fundamental changes to
the rules covering ITV just seven months after the new 10-year licences took
effect.
Mr Brooke is conscious that the ITV companies are split on the issue, with
Anglia, Meridian and HTV resolutely opposed to such a change. The row over
the botched attempt to move News at Ten has also tended to make
parliamentary opinion more negative on relaxing the takeover rules.
MPs believe the government will decide against taking early action partly
because of legislative difficulties.
Meanwhile the ITV companies may have given the Commons national heritage
committee potentially misleading information on their finances and the net
amount of money they must now pay the government.
The committee was told that this year the ITV system will pay the government
about Pounds 367m in addition to normal company taxation, consisting of the
bids for new franchises plus a slice of advertising revenue. The figure
would have been Pounds 150m under the old levy system, ITV said.
Yet when the Independent Television Commission announced the franchise
winners in 1991 it estimated that overall the ITV companies would end up
paying only Pounds 40m a year more over the life of the franchises.
The apparent disparity is largely a result of the ITV companies comparing
this year with 1992, the last year of the old franchises. Last year the
government announced a one-off reduction in levy designed, partly at least,
to give ITV a breathing space to prepare for the new system. As a result the
ITV companies benefited by about Pounds 105m last year. The underlying rate
of levy payments was considerably higher.
The ITV companies have also saved Pounds 66m a year because they no longer
have to fund the Welsh fourth channel, as well as saving about Pounds 20m in
the transmission costs of Channel 4 and a further Pounds 11m because schools
programmes have moved to Channel 4.
Overall the ITV companies would appear to be in a better relative financial
position than they indicated to the national heritage committee.

FT  12 JUL 93 / Agency's work may split 12 ways
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE WORK of Companies House, the government's corporate information agency,
may be divided up between as many as 12 private-sector businesses under
proposals from the Department of Trade and Industry.
Responsibility for fining companies which do not file accounts on time and
for selling the information they provide would be split between a series of
competing registrars.
The plan has been drawn up by SRU, the management consultancy hired by the
DTI last October to consider a range of options, from no change through to
full privatisation.
The plan suggests that companies should be able to file their accounts to a
private-sector registrar of their choice. A central index owned by all the
registrars would collect the information.
It is likely that the power to prosecute companies which fail to file
accounts, and some other important registration decisions, would remain
under the control of a much smaller government unit.
A memorandum circulating in Companies House from Mr David Durham, chief
executive and registrar, says that no decision has been taken on the future
of the agency and that various options remain open.
Mr Kieron Hill, regional officer for Wales for the National Union of Civil
and Public Servants, said: 'We want to protect our members' jobs and feel
the proposals are slanted towards privatisation and a move away from
headquarters in Cardiff.
'But we are also concerned that the users of Companies House services will
be subject to the whims of private-sector registrars who may neglect
compliance and legal obligations.'
SRU is canvassing the views of Companies House staff, Chambers of Commerce
and companies likely to be affected by the proposals.

FT  12 JUL 93 / Maverick MD steps in at crucial time
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR HARRY MOULSON is the closest thing to a new broom sweeping through the
corridors of British Gas's pipelines division. He joins a small group of
maverick directors gathered round Mr Cedric Brown, who took over as chief
executive a year ago with a mandate to change the company culture.
Mr Moulson has been pitched into one of the highest-profile jobs in the gas
business at a crucial time in its history. He could end up running his own
company with assets of Pounds 15bn if the Monopolies and Mergers Commission
recommends splitting pipelines from the rest of the business.
Although the 49-year-old Mr Moulson is a qualified gas engineer - in the
time-honoured tradition of British Gas managers - the bulk of his experience
has been in the marketing side of the business.
He has brought a new approach to the transport division. He is determined to
refer to the company's competitors which send gas through its pipeline
network as 'customers' rather than 'shippers'. A fresh approach is being
welcomed by most shippers: 'I do detect a genuine desire to look at things
another way,' said Mr Peter Bryant, deputy chairman of United Gas.
But Mr Moulson inherits a department which is frustrated at being forced to
give up market share to rivals in an effort to encourage competition, and
may face an uphill struggle in convincing some of his colleagues to regard
the shippers as worthy customers rather than an inconvenience. Also, some of
the shippers feel they are being thwarted by pipeline operators eager to
retain British Gas's upper hand.
Mr Moulson believes his job is to sell space in British Gas's pipelines  -
it does not matter whose gas fills that space. Although he does not have a
place on the British Gas main board, his initiative has Mr Brown's full
backing.
Mr Moulson spent a year at Harvard Business School and worked in the US for
the company's Global Gas division. The US business style is detectable in
his direct approach - an attribute not common among British Gas's managers.

FT  12 JUL 93 / Police face up to being measured: The implications of
service contracts for constables
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS LAST week's Association of Chief Police Officers conference considered a
potential new world of short-term contracts and performance-related pay, a
single chief constable spoke from experience.
He was Mr Desmond O'Brien, chief of the British Transport Police, which
already has all its senior officers on fixed-term contracts with performance
review related to pay.
It is the only force in the country to be operating a procedure which the
government-appointed Sheehy committee has recommended should apply
throughout the police service.
Mr O'Brien, his deputy and assistant chiefs transferred voluntarily to the
system three years ago. Mr O'Brien said it had proved that measurable
performance indicators could be set for the police. He told his fellow
senior officers at the conference: 'In dealing with under-performing
constables, we should also cater for under-performing chief constables.'
British Transport Police provides police services for British Rail and
London Underground.
Under the performance review system, Mr O'Brien agrees personal objectives
with his deputy and four assistant chief constables annually, and each May
gives them performance ratings that are reflected in their pay awards. Mr
O'Brien's own personal objectives are agreed with the chairman of the police
committee.
Individual objectives relate to police management issues. But, Mr O'Brien
said, the force had to ensure that it met its customers' expectations.
To help achieve this a budget group, consisting of the managing directors of
the rail businesses and the chief constable, produces a contract setting out
operational objectives and priorities - the current objectives relate to
crimes of violence, obstruction of railways, actions which endanger
customers and staff, graffiti and disruptions to services by suspect
packages.
The contract is used by the police committee, railway businesses and
customers as a means of measuring the force's performance. Mr O'Brien
believes that the establishment of a clear means of focusing on specific
objectives has contributed to a reduction in crime levels and an increase in
detection rates over the past three years.
When British Transport Police advertises for senior officers it makes clear
that - unlike the rest of the police service - successful applicants will be
on fixed-term contracts and performance-related pay. 'There is no shortage
of applicants willing to accept posts on these terms,' Mr O'Brien said. 'It
is surely wrong that an officer should be appointed to a senior post at the
age of 40 and remain in it for the next 20 years without any specific
assessment of performance.'
This is certainly the view of Sir Patrick Sheehy, chairman of BAT Industries
and of the committee of inquiry into police pay and responsibilities whose
report is being considered by Mr Michael Howard, home secretary.
Sir Patrick believes the pay of senior officers, in particular, should be
performance related, and this is unlikely to meet serious resistance in the
police service.
Chief constables are, however, much more apprehensive about the implications
of extending some of the same principles - particularly fixed-term contracts
 -to lower ranks.
The Sheehy committee recommends that police officers should serve on initial
10-year contracts, subsequently renewed each five years.
Some senior officers believe their ability to attract sufficient
high-quality recruits, both graduates and non-graduates, would be undermined
by the fear of possible dismissal after 10 years.
They say all that is needed is a procedure making it easier for the service
to shed under-performing individuals.

FT  12 JUL 93 / British Gas rejects price claim
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH GAS has rejected allegations that the price increases for
competitors using its pipeline, which it withdrew last week, would be
reinstated after the Monopolies and Mergers Commission report on the gas
industry due in three weeks' time. But it has not ruled out putting prices
back up after a review.
British Gas said: 'Nothing is ready to go on the table; the price rises may
be too high, too low or just right, but we will review that.'
Some of British Gas's competitors regard the company's decision last week to
withdraw price increases of up to 30 per cent as a cynical delaying tactic
to remove an area of potential controversy before the MMC report.
Mr Norman Ellis, managing director of Kinetica, a rival supplier, said: 'I
don't think they have any intention of changing these price increases,
they're just trying to impose them in a more palatable manner.'
British Gas has said it will delay price rises of between 2 per cent and 30
per cent until October next year. In the meantime it will review the charges
levied on users of its pipeline system.
Another shipper said: 'I'm worried they will try again (with the price
rises) and, of course, they are making business difficult for us because we
need some stability to plan our own charges to customers.'
Mr Harry Moulson, who takes over as managing director of British Gas's
National Transmission business tomorrow, has said he will not impose the
price increases until he has made a thorough examination of the company's
cost base. He also wants British Gas's marketing operations to be charged
the same for sending gas through the pipelines as is paid by rivals.
Ofgas, the industry regulator, believes that when British Gas proposed
putting up prices for gas transport, it was trying to shift its profit base
from the household supply market into pipelines.
Profits in domestic gas supply are being squeezed by a tough pricing
formula. To compensate for this, the company was trying to make its
pipelines more profitable. Ofgas says that for every Pounds 1 spent directly
on the pipeline system, British Gas had allocated another Pounds 7 of costs
to it.
This is the area which Mr Moulson will examine when satisfying himself that
the increases are justified. He also intends to hold more consultations with
rivals.

FT  12 JUL 93 / Teachers divided on NUT boycott
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NATIONAL Union of Teachers, the biggest teaching union, is launching a
boycott of appraisal arrangements which could be linked to
performance-related pay.
The move opens another front in its dispute with the government, which has
already led to the boycott by the three largest teaching unions of this
year's national curriculum tests.
But the move splits the unions, which have been united so far in their
opposition to the tests. Neither the National Association of
Schoolmasters/Union of Women Teachers, nor the Association of Teachers and
Lecturers, the other two large unions, will follow the NUT's lead.
Mr Doug McAvoy, the NUT general secretary, said that teacher-appraisal
interviews were being used to introduce performance-related pay.
The union will ask local education authorities and the governors of
grant-maintained schools to advise their schools not to link appraisal to
pay, or to award points for 'excellence'.
If local NUT representatives do not receive these assurances, they will
decide on further action - probably a boycott of appraisal interviews.
Mr McAvoy said: 'Performance-related pay will generate competition and
rivalry, destroying teamwork in schools. It is a device to divide and
destabilise the teaching profession dressed up in the guise of promoting
educational excellence.'
However, he said the NUT had no objection to appraisal interviews if they
were not related to pay.
The Department for Education said: 'We are disappointed that the NUT is
taking this stand. We are sure that all teachers will be in favour of
appraisal as a valuable way of developing professional expertise. All other
professionals are appraised in some way.'
The department added that appraisal has been in force since September 1990
and was carried out on a two-yearly cycle, which would make it an
inappropriate scheme to be linked with pay.
Mr David Hart, general secretary of the National Association of Head
Teachers, said the NUT was in danger of 'throwing out the baby with the bath
water'.
He said: 'The vast majority of schools would not want to use appraisal for
those purposes, and if they want to go down the performance-related pay
route in future, they will not do so unless there is a national scheme in
place. We are a long way from that.'
Mr Eamonn O'Kane, deputy general secretary of the NASUWT, said: 'There's no
point in firing off at too many targets. We certainly would not support the
campaign NUT are starting, mostly because of the multitude of other issues
facing teachers.'

FT  12 JUL 93 / Spending on IT 'may be running out of control'

telecommunications, computers and software - rose 9 per cent last year to
about Pounds 4.5bn and may be running out of control, Price Waterhouse
Management Consultants says today.
Its annual IT Review, based on a survey of 1,000 executives in the private
and public sectors, found that budgets had over-run for the third year in
succession. The increase contrasts with a rise of just 1 per cent forecast
by the same executives at the start of last year.
It brings the spending increase over the last three years to nearly 50 per
cent and underlines the difficulties of controlling costs.
Salaries for IT staff rose an average 6 per cent last year - double the rate
of inflation - and the average number of systems development staff rose by
about 25 per cent, according to the review.
Professor Kit Grindley, a Price Waterhouse consultant and professor of
systems automation at the London School of Economics, said: 'The problem of
how to make the computer work in the best interests of the company is no
longer as important as how to make it work more cheaply. Unfortunately, this
is a problem that British managers have yet to tackle effectively.'
The review found that one of the main responses to past overspending - a
move to 'open systems' or non-proprietary standards - had increased costs
for most organisations.
It also found wide variations in spending by different industries. Heading
the list was the relatively recession-proof utilities sector, where spending
rose 36 per cent last year as large projects ordered after privatisation
reached their expensive final phases.
In contrast, the struggling retail sector's spending rose just 0.5 per cent,
which represents a cut in real terms. Next lowest was the manufacturing
sector, where IT spending increased by 2 per cent.
Overall, the review is forecasting an increase of only 0.2 per cent in IT
spending this year. But it says this may also prove too conservative.

LOCAL and regional agencies need to work together to maintainengineering

Training and Enterprise Councils has found, Andrew Baxter writes.
The study recommends a regional policy forum to develop a strategy for the
sector.
It argues that the role of local and regional public agencies in economic
and industrial policy development in the UK - and particularly in the
south-east - is relatively undeveloped compared with other parts of Europe.
The study was produced by the Local Government Centre at Warwick Business

FT  12 JUL 93 / Washington keeps up the pressure / Examining the differing
perceptions in the US and Japan on the future of the framework trade deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SEOUL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
'THIS is the rules of the game, not the game itself,' insisted Mr Bowman
Cutter, deputy head of the White House's national economic council. Reading
from the same book, Mr Roger Altman, deputy Treasury secretary, pronounced:
'It's an agreement about the rules, now we get to play the game.'
The rules referred to are the new US-Japan negotiating framework to resolve
bilateral issues announced with some fanfare, after all-night bargaining, in
Tokyo on Saturday morning.
Both men, along with other US officials speaking privately, contend that the
agreement, stamping the seal on President Bill Clinton's performance at the
Tokyo Group of Seven summit, marks a new dawn in US-Japan relations in which
the economic and commercial components assume, as the president wanted, a
far more important dimension.
The 'framework' agreement for subsequent negotiations is precisely that. It
does not establish precise goals for shifts in Japanese macro-economic
policy, nor does it lay down criteria by which sectors of the Japanese
economy can be made more open to US goods and services, and by extension to
those of other countries.
But in tough language it lays out a negotiating timetable for these to be
achieved and it commits Japan to making what the agreement calls highly
significant macro and micro economic policy changes. As such, in the US
view, it places Japan under a far tougher obligation than all previous
attempts to settle bilateral disputes.
On the macro-economic side, the compact envisages mutually supportive
policies whereby the US seeks to reduce its budget deficit while Japan aims
to cut its global current account surplus.
At its current level of about Dollars 130bn (Pounds 86bn), Japan's global
current account surplus is equivalent to just over 3 per cent of GNP. The US
envisages that this can be reduced, mostly by appropriate fiscal policies,
to the target zone in 'four to five years'.
The unstated US agenda is that Japan should accomplish this less by its
traditional method of front-loading public works spending and more by income
tax cuts. While it may seem ironic for an administration that is proposing
one of the largest tax increases in US history at home to press the reverse
course on Japan, the US view is that this is the most effective means of
generating the sort of consumer-led demand in Japan that will suck in
imports.
What all this might do to the bilateral Japanese trade surplus with the US -
Dollars 50bn last year and rising fast - has not been made explicit. A
recent estimate by the Washington-based Institute for International
Economics contends that a cut to around Dollars 40bn is the most optimistic
outcome over a few years.
Much may depend on another, more controversial, aspect of the agreement  -
its insistence on greater sectoral access for imported products and
services. The agreement makes no mention of numerical targets as such.
However, it does accept that multiple criteria should be used to accept
progress in opening Japanese markets. The US will want to use these criteria
to set goals for policy, something the Japanese will resist.
Agreements in priority areas are to be reached over the next six months and
ratified when the US president and the Japanese prime minister meet early
next year, with the balance to be settled at a second get-together next
July.
After two years both governments will decide whether to extend this
framework agreement beyond the autumn of 1995.
The five principal components of the sectoral access deal cover:
Japanese government procurement, particularly in relation to purchases of
foreign computers, supercomputers, satellites, medical technology and
telecommunications.
Regulatory reform, covering financial services, insurance, the distribution
network and competition policy.
'Other major sectors', particularly cars and car parts.
Economic harmonisation, addressing issues affecting two-way foreign direct
investment, including intellectual property and access to technology.
Implementation - the monitoring of existing and future agreements.
The US team, led by Mr Cutter and Mr Altman and with substantial
contributions from other treasury and trade officials, did not necessarily
expect to conclude an agreement in Tokyo, especially with the Japanese
elections just over a week away. The Japanese, they report, were
particularly tough on the question of exemptions from US trade laws.
They may hang tougher still as the sectoral negotiations get serious, which
is why the US reserves the right of retaliation under existing trade
regulations. Mr Clinton may have made a powerful general case in Tokyo in
identifying what he saw as the common cause between Japanese consumers and
American workers but the appeal of that cause may fade as the two sides
finally take to the field under the new 'rules of the game'.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IRAQ yesterday sustained its defiance of United Nations weapons inspectors,
and brought closer the threat of a UN-backed strike against its military
installations, by refusing to allow UN experts to seal equipment at two
missile testing sites south of Baghdad.
A UN team led by Mr Mark Silver, a US weapons specialist, abruptly flew out
of Baghdad after failing to persuade the Iraqi authorities to allow switches
at the two sites to be fixed down and sealed with wax.
Mr Silver's three-member team spent less than 24 hours in Iraq and left the
moment it decided the Iraqis would not budge.
'I was not allowed to do what I went in for, and that is why I came out
immediately,' Mr Silver told reporters soon after arriving back at UN
headquarters in Bahrain.
The team's failure to accomplish its task is certain to prompt a renewed
collision between the UN and Iraq and raise the possibility of a military
strike against the two sites.
Mr Al Gore, US vice-president, said on NBC yesterday, that as a first step
Iraq would be asked to destroy the sites, if it continued to resist their
monitoring.
'If he (Iraqi president Saddam Hussein) refuses to do that, the UN could
consider a range of options - one of which could include the use of force
against them'.
Iraq called on the Security Council to prevent any punitive attack by the
US.
But at the same time Baghdad signalled continued defiance. Gen Amer Rasheed,
who heads Iraq's weapons development programme, said after Mr Silver's
departure that the country 'cannot accept seals of activities'. He added:
'We, as a nation, take all necessary measures to protect our people, our
land and facilities.'
The UN Special Commission had sought to seal the equipment as an interim
solution to the deadlock between UN inspectors and Iraq, after Baghdad's
refusal to install video monitors at the two sites.

FT  12 JUL 93 / Tokyo claims advantage in numerical targets battle /

framework trade deal
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPANESE officials yesterday presented the weekend trade framework agreement
with the US as a turning point, mainly because they believe it marks the
first success of a more assertive Japanese approach to the US.
Japan will claim that it came out best from the main dispute which has
dogged the negotiations since they started in April: whether numerical
targets should set goals for Japanese policies to open up its markets to
imports and reduce its current account surplus.
The Japanese approach on this issue marks a break with the past. In previous
trade disputes, the Japanese have started by talking tough but eventually
backed down. This time they started by publicly resisting numerical targets
and did not back down when the US applied pressure.
Japan will claim that because the agreement does not explicitly mention
numerical targets, it has won the day. The reality is that this central
dispute over targets will continue, but on a different footing.
Tokyo has successfully resisted US demands that it should set its economic
policies with the target of halving its current account surplus.
However, this does not mean Japan's powerful Finance Ministry has had it all
its own way. Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, in spite of his
weakness in the run-up to next weekend's elections, has forced the powerful
bureaucrats to concede for the sake of the agreement.
The Finance Ministry had proposed saying that it would promote domestic
growth, which would in turn 'contribute' to reducing the surplus by
increasing demand for imports. The wording of the agreement is substantially
tougher than Japanese bureaucrats wanted.
The agreement says Japan will 'actively pursue' strong and sustainable
demand-led growth, which is 'intended to achieve over the medium term a
highly significant decrease in the current account surplus'.
The short-term implications for Japanese fiscal and monetary policy are
clear.
The upheaval in Japan's political system means that for weeks, if not
months, the politicians will not be in a strong enough position to force the
Finance Ministry to consider a further shot of government spending to revive
the economy.
But the likelihood of a further pump-priming package in the autumn or early
next year is now much higher. As fiscal policy is so politically
constrained, in the short term the agreement will increase pressure on the
Bank of Japan for a further cut in interest rates, which are at an record
low of 2.5 per cent.
Japan has also resisted numerical targets for policies to open the domestic
market to imports, especially vehicle parts, high technology goods and
financial services.
The agreement says policies to open markets will be assessed using sets of
'objective criteria', a phrase introduced to the talks by the Japanese. The
content and role of these 'criteria' is almost certain to be the subject of
further rows between the two sides.
The US has backed down from its earlier call for Japan to accept as a goal a
33 per cent increase in its imports of manufactured goods over the next
three years. The agreement does not commit Japan to making sure a share of
its domestic market in particular sectors, such as autumotive components, is
taken by foreign products.
The Japanese did not get everything they wanted. Tokyo wanted a US
commitment that the 'criteria' would not be interpreted as targets. The US
has resisted this demand, so it is open to Washington to try to turn the
criteria into goals to guide Japanese import promotion policy.
So the framework does not settle the central dispute about whether targets
should be used, it merely puts the argument on a different footing.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton yesterday offered more sticks than carrots to North
Korea to persuade it to accept full nuclear inspections, as he ended his
visit to South Korea.
With US and North Korean officials preparing to hold discussions on the
nuclear issue in Geneva on Wednesday, Mr Clinton and Mr Warren Christopher,
the US secretary of state, reaffirmed that Pyongyang must fully comply with
international nuclear inspections or face UN sanctions.
'If we just stay strong and we stay resolute and we stay firm, we know that
will work,' said Mr Clinton as he toured the demilitarised zone that
separates North and South Korea. 'Eventually, we have to hope' that North
Korea will take the sensible course.'
'When you examine the nature of the American security commitment to Korea. .
. it is pointless for them to try to develop nuclear weapons because if they
ever use them it would be the end of their country.'
The president promised there would be no cuts in the number of US troops in
South Korea, now totalling 37,000, until the nuclear issue was resolved.
Mr Christopher said in a meeting with his South Korean counterpart that any
improvement in US-North Korean relations would depend on the progress in
inter-Korean ties, ruling out the possibility that Washington might
separately recognise Pyongyang in exchange for its full acceptance of
nuclear inspections.
The US has attached other conditions to better relations with North Korea,
including an improvement in human rights and renunciation of terrorism.
The US last month persuaded North Korea to suspend its withdrawal from the
nuclear non-proliferation treaty during high-level talks in New York.
Mr Christopher said Washington would not tolerate North Korea dragging its
feet endlessly during the new round of talks. If no appreciable progress was
achieved within a resonable period of time, the nuclear issue would be
referred to the UN Security Council for action.

FT  12 JUL 93 / The looming crisis in industrial country public debt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN WOLF
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
What cannot continue will not do so. The accumulation of public sector debt
by the governments of the industrial countries will have to stop. The
question is how will it be stopped and when.
Over the past quarter century, the ratio of aggregate gross public debt to
gross domestic product in OECD countries has risen from a little under 40
per cent, to 68 per cent (see chart). In only two brief periods has the
ratio fallen: during the inflationary economic expansion of the early 1970s
and again during the expansion of the second half of the 1980s.
Unfortunately, the rise in the debt ratio during recessions has more than
offset the paltry declines during the expansions. No wonder the June OECD
Economic Outlook remarks wryly on the need to avoid 'the kind of mistake
made in the late 1980s when some of the unexpected buoyancy of public
revenues associated with above-average growth was used to reduce tax rates
rather than to ensure greater fiscal consolidation and to reduce debt.'
True, net public debt is not as daunting as gross public debt: for 1994 the
OECD forecasts the former at 39 per cent. The net debt ratio has not risen
as much either, by 9 percentage points between 1984 and 1994, against 14
percentage points for gross debt. But the trend is similarly adverse.
Of the seven industrial countries whose heads of government met in Tokyo
last week, only Japan had managed a significant improvement in its public
debt postion between 1984 and 1994. Belgium and Italy already have
outstanding net public debt greater than their GDPs. Particularly important,
in view of the country's size, is the US deterioration, from a net public
sector debt ratio of 24.9 per cent in 1984 to the 40.7 per cent forecast for
next year.
High real interest rates put all debtors, including governments, on a
treadmill. Since the beginning of the 1980s, long-term real interest rates
have averaged between 4 and 7 per cent, says the OECD, with short-term rates
little lower. In the stable 1960s, by contrast, real interest rates were 1
to 3 per cent. Consequently, real interest rates have been well above
underlying rates of economic growth for a long time. Even though estimated
long-term real interest rates have recently fallen, they remain higher than
rates of economic growth, inevitably so during a recession.
The OECD explains these high real interest rates by:
the fiscal and monetary policy mix, with fiscal deficits, in particular,
averaging 3 per cent of GDP since the mid-1970s;
investor demand for a premium against inflation risk, particularly important
in the early 1980s; and
the liberalisation and globalisation of capital markets.
If real interest rates on public debt exceed the economy's likely growth
rate, as they have recently done, governments must run a primary fiscal
surplus - an excess of revenue over non-interest expenditure - if the ratio
of debt to GDP is to be kept stable. Should they run large primary deficits
during a recession, they must run offsetting surpluses thereafter. The task
can be daunting. Mr Major's government is now running a primary deficit of
5.7 per cent of GDP. This is two percentage points larger than the surplus
in 1988.
The danger is of a vicious circle from deficits to interest rates and back
again. If governments fail to run large enough primary surpluses, global
real interest rates tend to rise. As public debt increases, the fear of debt
crises also pushes up risk premiums in interest rates. Unsurprisingly, Italy
is the only major industrial country whose estimated long-term real interest
rates, at 6 per cent, are above their 1980-92 average, despite recession.
Governments that borrow in their own currencies do not default. They
inflate. At present, investors are feeling tolerant towards most OECD
governments. Whether they continue to do so depends less on whether current
deficits are cyclical or structural, which nobody knows, and rather more on
when investors think they will end. Governments that expect creditors to be
infinitely forbearing are due for a shock.

Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak yesterday won the backing of 97 per cent of
the People's Assembly to run as the sole candidate in the presidential
elections, clearing the way for him to take up his third six-year term, Mark
Nicholson writes from Cairo.
The petition makes the house's backing for Mr Mubarak all but certain on
July 21, when it must formally endorse his candidature by a two-thirds
majority. His nomination will then be put to a referendum in October, at
which a simple majority will return him. He won 97.1 per cent of the votes
in October 1987.

ISRAEL yesterday blamed Syria for an upsurge in attacks by Arab guerrillas
based in southern Lebanon and said it was considering how best to retaliate,
writes Julian Ozanne from Jerusalem.
Mr Uri Lubrani, Israel's chief negotiator with Lebanon at the Middle East
peace talks, said Syria was responsible for the latest escalation of
artillery duels, which last week left five Israeli soldiers dead. 'This
escalation requires different treatment than others up to now,' he said.
Syria, which has up to 40,000 troops in Lebanon, yesterday responded by
saying Israel's self-declared security zone in southern Lebanon, scene of
the clashes, was an 'explosive trap'.
Meanwhile, Mr Dennis Ross, US co-ordinator of the peace talks, is currently
shuttling between Middle East capitals as part of an intense diplomatic
effort to break the deadlock in the US-backed peace process.

FT  12 JUL 93 / Nigerian parties fall in line: Politicians back Babangida,
though some dissent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ADAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MILITARY coups have ousted civilians from power twice in Nigeria's recent
history but the annulment of last month's presidential elections may have
deprived Mr Moshood Abiola of power even before he was sworn in to office.
By co-opting both political parties, Mr Abiola's Social Democratic party
(SDP) and the rival National Republican Convention (NRC), to back the idea
of an interim government, President Ibrahim Babangida may succeed in
overturning the mandate of the ballot box aided by civilian leaders.
The manipulation of the June polls had provoked serious divisions in the
senior ranks of the military and mass protests on the streets of Lagos.
When Gen Babangida threatened to dissolve all democratic institutions, the
instinct for self-preservation brought the civilian politicians into line.
This is the fourth setback since 1990 to Nigeria's transition to democracy,
which is unlikely to reach completion by the August 27 deadline. Gen
Babangida proposes to hand over to an unelected interim government which
would be approved by the military regime.
Except for an elected head of state, Mr Babangida has created every other
democratic civilian institution during his overhaul of Nigerian politics and
last week they came to his aid.
Party officials, elected leaders of local and state governments and members
of the two-tier national and state assemblies enjoy the status and
privileges of office while the standard of living among most Nigerians is in
sharp decline.
In a speech broadcast at the end of June, the president said the elections,
in which the SDP gained a clear majority, were so flawed that if the results
were upheld it would provide an unsound basis for democracy after August.
The NRC argued for fresh elections, which the SDP rejected.
Then came the ultimatum: dissolution of all democratic institutions unless
the parties agreed to co-operate with the government by Friday morning. From
all over Nigeria, anxious politicians converged on Abuja, the federal
capital, to talk to the government which had created their positions.
'State governors were lobbying hard, late into Thursday night, to prevent
their jobs being scrapped,' said a federal government adviser in Abuja.
The parties agreed to form an interim government provided that 'democratic
institutions remain in place' and subject to agreement on 'the composition
and tenure of the proposed government'.
However, there remain signs of dissent. Mr Abiola yesterday reiterated his
opposition to the deal, ruling out his participation in an interim civilian
government. In a sign of political division, meanwhile, some members of the
NRC were still demanding parity with the SDP.
Gen Babangida has summoned all his senior security service officers to Abuja
before announcing his next move.
The future of Mr Abiola is unclear. The Sultan of Sokoto, head of Islam in
Nigeria, made a rare political speech last Thursday in support of him.
The sultan is foremost traditional ruler in northern Nigeria, where Mr
Abiola as a southerner was expected to lack support. In June the SDP won a
majority of states in the north including Kano, home of his opponent Mr
Bashir Tofa. As Gen Babangida promised six years ago, Nigerian politics
produced a leader cutting across ethnic boundaries.

NEW YORK Governor Mario Cuomo was yesterday involved in last-ditch talks to

buy the ailing newspaper on Friday, Martin Dickson writes from New York.
Mr Murdoch, running the paper temporarily under a contract from the
bankruptcy court, ceased publication on Friday, saying the Post's 11 unions
did not give him enough cost concessions to make the paper viable.
However, Mr Cuomo was at the centre of attempts to revive the negotiations
and some officials hoped Mr Murdoch might be tempted back if the unions gave
further ground.

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE successor to Mr Gerald Corrigan as president of the Federal Reserve Bank
of New York, one of the most powerful positions in international finance, is
likely to emerge this week.
Mr Corrigan, who announced his decision to step down in January, is due to
leave on August 20. If the search committee fails to make a recommendation
at Thursday's monthly meeting of the bank's board of directors, it will have
to wait until August 19. That would not leave enough time before Mr
Corrigan's departure for the confirmation of the candidate by the governors
of the Federal Reserve Board in Washington.
Three names have emerged as front-runners for the post, which is second only
to the Fed chairmanship in importance in the US central bank system. But the
selection process has taken longer than normal. One observer with a close
knowledge of the Fed said last week: 'I heard that there was a real fight
over this. Someone clearly had a rough time making up their minds.'
The front-runners are: Mr William McDonough, Mr Corrigan's number two in New
York and the official responsible for implementing Fed policy in the
domestic bond market and foreign exchange markets; Mr Thomas Melzer,
president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St Louis; and Mr Gary Stern,
president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis. Mr McDonough is tipped
by most insiders to win the job.
Others believed to have been considered include Ms Karen Horn, chairman of
Bank One in Ohio and former president of the Federal Reserve Bank of
Cleveland; Mr David Mullins, vice-chairman of the Federal Reserve; and Mr
Richard Syron, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston.
In the past, the New York Fed president has played a key role in helping the
financial system survive crises, including the October 1987 stock market
crash.

FT  12 JUL 93 / US-Cuba phone links could mean softer line: Congress is
starting to listen to more moderate Cuban voices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AT first glance, relations between Cuba and the US have rarely been icier:
Cuba's devastated economy is driving more people to flee the country,
leading to more shootings by Cuban border guards and a flurry of diplomatic
protests from the US.
'Because things are so desperate in Cuba and more people think the end is at
hand, there have been more incidents that could provoke tension,' comments
Mr Ernest Preeg, former chief economist at the US Agency for International
Development and author of a recent study on Cuba's economic prospects once
the US trade embargo is lifted.
A State Department spokesman last week criticised Cuba's 'barbaric' attacks
both on US-registered boats trying to pick up refugees and on swimmers
trying to reach asylum in the US Guantanamo naval base, on the island's
southeastern coast.
This drew a sharp rebuttal from Mr Roberto Robaina, Cuba's foreign minister,
who called the US complaint 'an infamy, a provocation and, at the very
least, a shameful lack of seriousness'.
Telecommunications between Cuba and the US are also at one of their worst
levels in years: last year's Hurricane Andrew destroyed AT&amp;T's microwave
links from south Florida and Cuba has now sharply cut the volume of US calls
it will allow to be routed through Italy.
However, the US State Department is preparing new guidelines that could
greatly ease telephone links with Cuba and mark a step along what some Cuba
experts believe might turn out to be a path towards warmer relations.
Significantly, some AT&amp;T officials expect the new guidelines to allow Cuba
to take some of the revenue from the telephone calls, instead of freezing it
all in an escrow, as happens today.
Also indicative of a thaw has been President Fidel Castro's recent decision
to allow some prominent dissidents to travel abroad, while last month, in a
move that could have far-reaching economic consequences, he asked the
national assembly to consider legalising use of the dollar in Cuba.
US Cuban policy has always been dominated by an argument over whether to use
threats to finish the work of the trade embargo and topple the Castro
government, or incentives to bring about change more quickly.
In political terms, the former school of thought, expounded by the
Cuban-American National Foundation, a well-financed Miami exile group led by
Mr Jorge Mas Canosa, has always dominated. It still commands a clear
majority in Congress, but has lost some of its strongest supporters, such as
Mr Dante Fascell, the Florida congressman who chaired the House of
Representatives foreign affairs committee until his retirement this year.
Members of Congress have started to listen to some of the more moderate
voices in the Cuban exile community. The House recently voted to kill
funding for TV Marti, the US-financed propaganda station beamed to Cuba and
closely aligned with Mr Canosa.
The new administration does not appear to have developed a clear Cuba policy
yet. During the election campaign, Mr Bill Clinton took an even tougher line
on Cuba than President George Bush, but his appointees include some who have
in the past favoured more dialogue with Cuba.
Telephone links are one area where the two camps agree. The Cuban-American
National Foundation, which in general opposes any easing of the embargo,
backs easier and cheaper telecommunications, and this measure was included
in a bill passed last year which otherwise sought to tighten the economic
noose on Cuba.
Demand for phone links among the Cuban exile community is high. Even before
the limited AT&amp;T microwave link was destroyed by the hurricane, the company
was able to connect only around 500,000 calls out of 60m attempted each
year.
The cost of getting through to Cuba has risen sharply. AT&amp;T says that if it
could serve the island directly, its charges would average Dollars 1.55
(Pounds 1) a minute; with the service via Italy cut to a trickle, many
exiles now dial pirate services in Canada, at prices ranging from Dollars
3.50 to Dollars 7.50 a minute.
Cuba prefers the Canadian links, because it receives a share of the revenue
in the form of desperately needed hard currency. The restriction on AT&amp;T's
Italian traffic is seen as a bargaining ploy to weaken US insistance that
all revenue go into the escrow account, which has an estimated Dollars 60m
already.

FT  12 JUL 93 / US flooding disaster area grows: Rain is expected to ease,
but east coast heatwave adds to weather problems
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US government yesterday declared 44 more Missouri counties disaster
areas, adding to the six-state area in the upper Mississippi basin that has
been devastated by weeks of rain and floods.
While weather forecasters predicted the rain would slacken over the next few
days in the upper Midwest, Mr Elbert Joe Friday, director of the National
Weather Service, warned there was now so much in the river basins that
flooding could last for weeks.
'It could very well go toward the end of August,' he cautioned yesterday.
The heavy rains have soaked acres of farmland and driven the Mississippi to
levels that in many locations surpass the peaks recorded in the 1973 floods,
the most devastating in recent memory.
Flooding has also closed the water purification centre in Des Moines, Iowa,
depriving 250,000 people of clean water.
At the same time, the east coast of the US is caught by a heatwave. A week
of temperatures above 95 degrees has taken more lives so far than the
flooding in the Midwest.
At St Louis, just below the Mississippi's junction with the Missouri, floods
are expected to crest at 45 feet this week, higher than the 43.3 feet peak
recorded in 1973. River flow at St Louis is expected to reach 1m cubic feet
per second.
The great floods of 1844 are believed to have reached a flow of 1.3m cubic
feet per second, but the destruction they caused was much less.
Some critics say developers have invited disaster by building in the flood
plain, instead of up on the river bluffs as in the past. Efforts by the Army
Corps of Engineers to control flooding with a programme of dams and levees
may only have worsened the situation by confining the Mississippi within a
narrower channel.
'Rivers are supposed to flood. You cannot control a river the volume and the
size of the Mississippi,' comments Ms Susie Wilkins of American Rivers, a
Washington-based conservation group.
Other critics say the federal government has exacerbated the problem by not
enforcing planning restrictions to divert development away from the riskiest
areas as a quid pro quo for the cheap insurance it has provided since 1968.

FT  12 JUL 93 / Bosnia Moslems form federal plan

BOSNIA'S collective presidency said yesterday it had agreed on the outline
of a plan to create a federation out of the war-torn republic, as the chief
UN relief official yesterday warned that humanitarian operations in Bosnia
were in jeopardy.
'They (presidency members) agreed the constitutional make-up of
Bosnia-Hercegovina should be along the lines of a federal state in which all
citizens of three nationalities will have equal rights,' said a statement,
read out by Moslem vice-president Ejup Ganic after the talks in Zagreb, the
Croatian capital.
The announcement, agreed after two days of debate, is likely to be rejected
by Serb and Croat leaders, who have eagerly backed the republic's ethnic
partition. The Bosnian plan rejects the principle of ethnic division and
says provinces would have to be worked out on economic lines.
Serb leaders at the weekend reiterated warnings that the Moslems would be
left with nothing if they rejected a three-way partition. Moslems have
opposed the division of Bosnia fearing it will leave them in economically
unviable reservations.
Most of the 10-member presidency has opposed the Serbo-Croat plan to divide
the republic along ethnic lines despite the urging for an agreement from
international peace mediators Lord Owen and Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg or face
disaster in the winter.
Mrs Sadako Ogata, United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) said
the Bosnian operation was running out of money and called for a conference
in Geneva on Friday to discuss the problems impeding the relief effort.
While she did not say the UNHCR would pull out of Bosnia, she accused all
sides of sabotaging the relief operation.
Her remarks came as water supplies dipped dangerously low in Sarajevo
because Serb besiegers were blocking fuel tanks from reaching the Bosnian
capital. The fuel was earmarked for water pumps to supply Sarajevo.
Doctors fear outbreaks of typhoid and dysentery in the city, which has been
deprived of electricity as well as water. A UN official in Sarajevo said
Bosnian defenders refuse to restore a supply grid which would also revive a
Serb arms factory in the suburb of Vogosca. The official said Serbs,
meanwhile, were refusing to repair a key power line from the Kakanj area in
Moslem-held central Bosnia until Moslem snipers stopped targeting the
Vogosca link.

FT  12 JUL 93 / Further arrest in water inquiry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ITALIAN police have detained Mr Ettore Fortuna, chairman of the country's
mineral water industry association, on allegations of paying illegal
political contributions.
His arrest follows similar charges on Friday against Mr Bruno Mentasti,
managing director of the popular San Pellegrino brand, and Mr Giuliano De
Polo, chairman of San Benedetto, and the arrest this month of Mr Carlo
Violati, the former chairman of the Ferrerelle brand. Mr Violati allegedly
paid L200m (Pounds 87,000) to speed Health Ministry investigations into the
quality of his company's water.
The bubble burst for all four men after magistrates began interrogating Mr
Giovanni Marone, the secretary of Mr Francesco De Lorenzo, the former health
minister. According to Mr Marone's testimony, which has been widely leaked,
Mr Fortuna paid about L250m to facilitate the introduction of new European
Community mineral water standards into Italy.
The arrests reinforce allegations that the Health Ministry was one of the
most lucrative sources of funds for Italian politicians.
Mr De Lorenzo, who resigned in February after allegations of a
jobs-for-votes scam in his native Naples, has since been told by magistrates
he is under investigation for a string of alleged kickbacks and alleged
illegal political contributions.
Among those arrested so far following testimony from Mr Marone are a number
of top drugs company executives and executives from some of Italy's biggest
advertising and public relations companies.
All are accused of paying kickbacks to the ministry to influence drugs
policy or win business on Italy's big anti-Aids campaign.
Mr Renato Marnetto, a former finance director of the state-owned Eni energy
and chemicals group, is reported to have told magistrates that the company
paid Dollars 20m (Pounds 13.3m) to the Libyan government to prevent the full
nationalisation of its assets in the 1970s.
The allegations, which come from normally reliable leaked testimony, claim
the money was paid to Mr Abdessalam Jallud, second in command to Libya's
leader, Colonel Muammer Gadaffi.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RUSSIA emerged at last week's Tokyo summit as an intrusive but inevitable
presence at Group of Seven gatherings as it struggles to switch from
frightening superpower to market-based democracy.
The bearish figures of the two Borises - President Boris Yeltsin and his
equally tall finance minister, Mr Boris Fyodorov - stood out in sharp
contrast to their slight Japanese hosts in a vivid double act combining both
the old and the new Russia.
While Mr Yeltsin used his talent for plain speaking to push for better
access to western markets, the younger Mr Fyodorov reassured his western
counterparts they have a solid interlocuter who knows the details of what
further economic reforms involve.
Mr Yeltsin, despite joking at a final news conference that he would not be
allowed back into Russia if he returned the disputed Kurile islands to
Japan, did little to mend fences with Tokyo. But he said he was prepared to
discuss the sovereignty issue on a long-delayed bilateral visit in October.
Western leaders, confirming more than Dollars 43bn (Pounds 28.6bn) in aid
and loans for Russia, treated the Russian leader with a mixture of tact and
caution.
Mr Yeltsin was immediately invited to next year's G7 gathering in Naples. As
President Bill Clinton put it, Russia was of crucial political significance
even if it did not yet qualify to become a full member.
The problems of other former Soviet republics could not help but follow Mr
Yeltsin to Tokyo.
However, Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the foreign minister, was relaxed enough to
talk, if only to comment on the various crises breaking out in the former
Soviet Union.
He announced, for instance, that Russia wanted United Nations peace monitors
to help Russian troops impose a settlement on the southern republic of
Georgia and separatist Abkhaz rebels accused of receiving support from
Russian troops out of Moscow's control.
This followed an appeal for humanitarian assistance sent to the G7 summit by
Mr Eduard Shevardnadze, the Georgian leader, whom many G7 politicians know
personally from his days as Soviet foreign minister.
But most worrying was Ukraine, whose President Leonid Kravchuk asked the G7
on the eve of the summit not to forget economic assistance to the second
most powerful republic after Russia. While Mr Yeltsin was in Tokyo, it made
new threats not to give up its nuclear weapons as required by the Start 1
disarmament treaty which the US and Russia want it to ratify.
In an attempt to make it feel less excluded, Presidents Clinton and Yeltsin
said they would offer Ukraine a 'trilateral deal' to encourage it to stick
to earlier plans to become a nuclear-free state.

FT  12 JUL 93 / Regional jostling ties up Yeltsin assembly / A look at new
wrangling over a constitution for Russia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RUSSIA'S constitutional convention starts a new session today that seems
certain to continue and deepen the fissures in the country's power structure
over the future form of the state.
A new text of the constitution has been produced in the last few days by the
convention's working group, a copy of which has been obtained by the
Financial Times.
Like its predecessors, it is replete with rights and freedoms for the
citizens of Russia, and is careful in many instances to emphasise the break
between the formal documents of the Soviet era and the present-day intention
to underpin the rights of a free people within a democracy.
However, the contentious parts of the draft constitution are not, for most
people - except the die-hard communists who have their own document
proposing a return to the dictatorship of the proletariat - the promulgation
of human and civil rights. Instead, they lie in the competing powers and
responsibilities of the federal centres and the regions and republics within
the Russian federation.
It is the republican and regional leadership that Mr Boris Yeltsin, the
Russian president, relied on when he bypassed parliament to bring together
the convention - largely made up of regional representatives. However,
though this has, for the moment, shifted the struggle from a forum in which
he could not hope to gain assent to one better disposed towards him, he now
runs up against the jealousies and fears of leaders who are trying to
safeguard their own and their peoples' interests at a time when the centre
seems to bring only inflation and taxes.
The response of the republics and regions has been to demand more and more
autonomy. And, because earlier drafts favoured the republics over the
regions (the republics marked ethnic territorial units reflecting the
imperial nature of Russia's expansion in the 19th century), the latter are
now declaring themselves republics in order to claim extra rights.
In the latest draft there has been a conscious effort to equalise the
treatment of the 'subjects of the federation'.
For example, a small insertion in one clause gives the regions and the
republics the right to make 'laws', the scope of which is not defined, while
another allows the possibility of accession to the federation by means of a
separate treaty - thus opening the possibility of bringing in Tatarstan, the
powerful republic which has always demanded special treatment.
At the same time, the drafters believe, anomalies have been ironed out of
the relationship between the president and the parliament - with the
president in the superior position but with parliament having greater power
than previously envisaged in initiating legislation and in deciding on the
composition of the government.
An earlier clause which appeared to suggest that the president was the
highest court in the land has been clarified to read that he will seek to
arbitrate in disputes between the centre and the regions, or between the
regions themselves - but if he fails, the case will revert to the courts.
However, the differences among the regions and republics appear to be too
great to enable agreement today, or in the near future. The republics resent
being reduced to the level of the regions: the regions will tolerate nothing
less: all resent the special status of Tatarstan. Mr Sergei Shakharai, the
deputy premier who has been the driving force behind the Convention on Mr
Yeltsin's side, said at the weekend that 'we should adopt an interim
constitutional agreement instead' - a view shared by Mr Sergei Filatov, Mr
Yeltsin's chief of staff.
The most likely timetable now appears to be that a two to three week period
will elapse in which the regions and republics consider the draft and make
their views felt; in the likelihood that no compromise will be possible
among them, there should be an attempt to adopt an interim constitutional
agreement and an election law, allowing elections to a new parliament which
 -unlike the old Soviet era assembly - would have the credibility and the
mandate to agree the legal basis of the state.
Mr Anatoly Sobchak, the influential mayor of St Petersburg and himself a
lawyer, said in an interview with the Interfax agency that elections should
be held at every level so that the system can renew itself as far as
possible and so that the legislative assemblies across the Russian land mass
'reflect the true balance of forces in the country'.
With these forces still gathering and feeling their strength, unsure of
their own and others' limits, and inexperienced in the interplay of
democratic struggle - the constitutional process in Russia could be
prolonged, perhaps dangerously so.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Mario Segni, the popular leader of Italy's referendum movement, is
expected to join forces with the cross-party Democratic Alliance movement
this week in a union that could form the basis for a new, broad-based party
capable of challenging the majority Christian Democrats for the political
middle-ground.
Mr Segni, who broke away from the Christian Democrats this year, has been a
leading advocate of political reform and clean government. The Democratic
Alliance is a loose reformist movement set up by politicians who have left
their parties in recent months in protest at corruption and obstacles to
political reform. Members include Mr Giorgio Ruffolo, the former Socialist
environment minister, and Mr Giuseppe Ayala, previously a leading anti-Mafia
judge and now a Republican MP.
Delegates at the Alliance's national convention in Florence on Saturday were
read a message from Mr Segni suggesting the movement should now move towards
transforming itself into an official political party. His message came as
tensions within the Christian Democrat party, which has been discredited by
the corruption scandal, increased.
Ms Rosi Bindi, a regional party leader who has spearheaded calls for reform,
proposed at the weekend to make the party's Veneto region the test-bed for
change. At a conference in the spa town of Abano, Ms Bindi proposed changing
the party's name and adopting a reformist programme.
Her demands come just a fortnight before a crucial Christian Democrat
national convention, which may mark the party's last chance to agree
changes. The party could break up if reform does not come quickly.
Pressure on the Christian Democrats to distance themselves from the
corruption scandal has been reinforced by the strength of the federalist
Lombard League. At its annual meeting in Pontida, near Bergamo, Mr Umberto
Bossi, the League's leader, yesterday threatened to declare a tax strike if
President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro did not call a general election after
parliamentary approval of the 1994 budget later this year.
Prime minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi met senior cabinet colleagues yesterday
to discuss the government's budget plans for 1994-1996, to be put to
parliament later this week. Next year's budget, usually presented in
September but brought forward to July this year, is expected to reduce the
estimated L180,000bn (Pounds 78bn) budget deficit by between L35,000bn and
L40,000bn next year.

SPAIN'S senior financial crimes judge has for the third time this year
rejected efforts by the Kuwait Investment Office (KIO) to open criminal
proceedings against the former chairman of the KIO, Sheikh Fahad Mohammed Al
Sabah, and the former management of the KIO's troubled Spanish industrial
investments.
The KIO claims that it lost all Dollars 5bn (Pounds 3.3bn) invested in Spain
in the mid-1980s because of mismanagement and that up to Dollars 500m of
this was stolen. The judge, rejecting a new KIO writ on Friday, said the
Kuwaitis had produced no new evidence and there was no evidence in the writ
of criminal conduct. The KIO will appeal, for the second time.
The KIO's efforts coincide with indications that a civil writ issued against
many of the same defendants in London is also likely to become bogged down
in arguments over jurisdiction.

FT  12 JUL 93 / Balladur bonds raise FFr110bn: Sign of confidence in
government, says French PM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRENCH Prime Minister Edouard Balladur yesterday confirmed that his special
bond issue, linked to privatisation and designed to promote economic
recovery, had brought in FFr110bn (Pounds 12.8bn), or nearly three times its
target.
'A few months ago, the French gave us their votes,' Mr Balladur said in
reference to his March election victory, 'and today they are entrusting us
with their money.' He claimed that the threefold oversubscription of the
loan was 'an exceptional sign of confidence' in the government.
But the fact that the 'Balladur bond' issue has brought in far more money
than any previous state borrowing is also due to its special advantages.
These give subscribers preference in buying shares in companies which are to
be privatised from this autumn, and enable them to switch from money market
funds into tax-free share savings plans. So, although the four-year Balladur
bonds carry an interest rate of 6 per cent a year, the real cost to the
state - and corresponding advantage to the bond's subscribers - is put by
analysts at 7 per cent or more.
The original target for the bond issue had been set at FFr40bn. In an
interview yesterday with Journal de Dimanche, the prime minister said he
would use the 'surplus' of some FFr70bn to 'support business activity and to
reduce the public debt', for example by repaying companies the value added
tax refund they are owed by the state more quickly. This speedier VAT refund
had already been announced by the government, however.
The prime minister said the bond issue's success and the lowering of
interest rates had both safeguarded the state's welfare system and held the
prospect of lower unemployment in coming months.

<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BELARUS, Russia and Ukraine, the three former Soviet republics which created
the Commonwealth of Independent States, have pledged themselves to a close
economic union designed to knit together once more their devastated
economies.
The agreement was announced at the weekend as waves made by the Russian
parliament's decision on Friday to declare Russian ownership of the port of
Sevastopol in the Ukrainian region of Crimea subsided, at least for the
moment.
Ukrainian leaders appeared pacified yesterday by comments from Mr Boris
Yeltsin on his return from the Group of Seven summit in Tokyo. The Russian
president said he was 'ashamed' of the decision.
The prime ministers of the three Slav states signed a 'declaration on
economic integration' which commits them to an economic treaty by September
1. This would sweep away both formal and informal barriers to trade, permit
citizens of all three countries to live, work and buy property in the others
and propose new institutions for developing a 'common economic space'.
Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, the Russian premier, hinted that the agreement would
go 'much further' than mere economic union - a possible reference to a
clause in the declaration which says that 'the governments proceed from the
fact that economic integration cannot be effective in isolation without a
wider, multilateral mutual action in the political, defence and legislative
areas'.
However, the agreement faces a number of hurdles before it can be taken at
face value, not least that it is one among many such declarations which have
barely addressed the growing distance between the members of the CIS.
It is only an agreement to agree - at the mercy of a worsening of relations
between the states over the next few weeks, especially between Ukraine and
Russia.
The union reunites the original signatories of the CIS agreement in December
1991 but leaves out the other seven members, especially the Central Asian
states of Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan, all of which
have clamoured to remain in the group.
Mr Vyacheslav Kebich, the Belarussian prime minister, denied that the
non-Slav peoples had been left 'out in the cold' but the declaration itself
specified 'certain conditions' which would be attendant on their joining the
new 'union within a union'.
Mr Alexander Shokhin, the Russian deputy prime minister, said that a
condition of membership was that the participating states should not be
members of any other such union. However, the Central Asian states have
already formed their own 'common market'.

FT  12 JUL 93 / World Bank to sharpen its focus on cutting poverty
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE WORLD Bank will today unveil a strategy to overhaul its management
priorities and halt an alarming decline in the quality of projects in its
loan portfolio.
The move is in response to a growing debate over the effectiveness of the
world's multilateral development banks, the US in particular pressing for
more effective use of its contributions.
Executive directors representing the Bank's shareholder countries agreed
last week on a programme, entitled Next Steps, to remedy some of the
problems highlighted last year by an investigative taskforce chaired by Mr
Willi Wapenhans, a former senior Bank official.
Representatives from the Group of Seven leading industrial nations rejected
an earlier draft of the programme as inadequate. But during three days of
board meetings last week the directors agreed that the document was now 'as
close as we are going to get', in the words of one official.
The programme, coupled with moves to improve the transparency of the World
Bank's operations by increasing disclosure and instituting an independent
inspection panel, could have far-reaching effects on the way the
Washington-based development institution does business. Next Steps attempts
to shift the World Bank's focus away from how much money it lends each year
towards its mission to reduce poverty in the developing world, through
changes in review processes and career incentives.
There will in future be more emphasis on detailed country reviews which will
provide a framework for individual project loans. Promotions will also be
based on how well projects perform, and not, as in the past, on the number
and size of loans negotiated by staff.
'While commitment levels and the size of resource transfers cannot be
ignored, the ultimate test of the Bank's operations is the actual
performance of Bank-financed programmes, including their long-term
development impact on our clients and particularly on the poorest segments
of their populations,' the Next Steps document says.
The Wapenhans report revealed alarming problems with the Bank's
follow-through on loans: the proportion of projects in the World Bank's
Dollars 138bn (Pounds 92bn) portfolio showing big problems nearly doubled
from 11 per cent in 1981 to 20 per cent a decade later. Projects were taking
an average of 2 1/2 years longer to complete than Bank staff estimated at
the outset.
Environmental groups have already criticised the Next Steps programme for
focusing too much on financial accountability and too little on improving
the actual development impact of the Bank's lending.
Discussions on disclosure during last week's board meetings also made
considerable progress, and a final document will be prepared over the
summer. The creation of an inspection panel has proved more controversial,
but a final paper is expected to be drafted by the World Bank's annual
meeting in September.
Executive directors are leaning towards an appeals commission to respond to
complaints from local citizens and environmental and human rights groups,
but insist the commission must be answerable to the board. This is likely to
disappoint outside critics of the bank, who have argued that a wholly
independent panel is needed.
However, the measures are expected to satisfy the US government, which has
played a critical role in prodding the Bank towards new policies on
disclosure and appeals. The administration has been backed by the threat of
Congress withholding authorisation for the US's Dollars 3.75bn contribution
to the International Development Association, the World Bank unit which
provides low interest rate loans to the very poorest countries.

FT  12 JUL 93 / Sun's 5p price cut launches tabloid war
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR RUPERT MURDOCH last night launched a bitter tabloid circulation war as
his main popular newspaper, The Sun, announced it was cutting its price by
5p to 20p.
The move, to last through the summer, is designed to boost flagging popular
newspaper sales in the difficult summer market and put pressure on The Sun's
main rivals, the Daily Mirror and the Daily Star.
Mr David Banks, editor of the Daily Mirror last night unveiled his response
as soon as he was sure the Sun presses had begun to roll for the first
edition.
For today only the Daily Mirror is cutting its price to 10p to allow
potential readers to sample the paper. 'I hope this highlights the lunacy
and stupidity of The Sun's cut-price tactics,' Mr Banks said. The paper will
return to its normal cover price of 27p tomorrow.
Mr David Montgomery, chief executive of Mirror Group Newspapers, described
The Sun's price cut as 'the act of a desperate man with no other cards to
play but cost-cutting'. He said the Daily Mirror would be promoted as a
quality popular daily that was worth paying for.
Mr Banks added that The Sun had still 'a long way to fall in price before it
found its true level'.
The Sun's price experiment, which the editor, Mr Kelvin MacKenzie, described
yesterday as 'a recession beater', followed market research carried out at
Martin's newsagents in areas such as Southampton and Milton Keynes. A local
5p price cut advertised by posters in the newsagents resulted in an 8 per
cent increase in sales.
Mr Murdoch, chairman of News Corporation, who personally authorised the
price cut on Friday, is taking a gamble that a dramatic price cut and the
accompanying publicity will lure back some of the lost regular readers.
Sales of the mass circulation dailies have been in decline for some time.
Between January and June, for example, The Sun suffered a 2.6 per cent drop.
The Daily Mirror fared better but sales still fell 1.76 per cent.
The results of The Sun's price promotion will be assessed in mid-September
when a decision will be taken on whether or not to return to 25p.
Mr MacKenzie, who is appearing in a television campaign to promote the price
cut, said the paper would cut its price to 15p if anyone tried to match the
first reduction.

FT  12 JUL 93 / Maxwell funds seek Pounds 56m from Goldman Sachs: Pension
schemes ask for detailed talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GOLDMAN SACHS, the US-based investment bank, has been asked to pay up to
Pounds 56m to two pension schemes formerly controlled by the late Mr Robert
Maxwell.
This is the first time that Goldman Sachs, which dealt extensively for the
Robert Maxwell family and their companies, has been approached for payment
in connection with the pension schemes. Goldman is not believed so far to
have rebuffed the requests.
The requests, made in the past few weeks by two former Maxwell pension
schemes, relate to a series of transactions in 1990 in which Goldman Sachs
acted as purchaser for shares in Maxwell Communication Corporation from the
Mirror Group Pension Scheme and the Maxwell Communication Corporation Staff
Scheme. It is not clear on whose behalf Goldman Sachs was acting, but the
shares were later repurchased from the firm by two Liechtenstein-based
trusts controlled by Maxwell family interests.
The requests have been made in letters to Goldman Sachs from the pension
schemes, which are now seeking detailed discussions. The Mirror Group
Pension Scheme last year filed a writ against five UK and international
banks seeking about Pounds 87m for assets which it claims were wrongly taken
from the scheme. The first of these cases is set to come to court next
January.
It is believed that Sir John Cuckney, chairman of the government-appointed
charitable trust which raises money for the Maxwell pensioners, is seeking
round-table talks with all banks against which the pension schemes are
likely to pursue claims. For any party to admit it is in talks would suggest
it erred in carrying out the relevant transactions.
It is expected that if Goldman Sachs agreed to hand over all or part of the
money it would seek a privacy agreement barring disclosure of details of the
deal.
Sir John is understood to believe the best course of action would be for
firms wishing to make payments to be able to make them anonymously to his
trust, which could later announce the total sum raised.
Sir John believes anonymity is essential if pension fund assets are to be
secured without resorting to the courts.
According to testimony last autumn before the parliamentary select committee
on social security, Goldman bought the shares from the two pension schemes
but made payment to a third party, Bishopsgate Investment Trust (BIT), a
private entity which acted for the Maxwell family interests. Goldman Sachs
has said it paid the funds to BIT on the instructions of Mr Maxwell's son,
Mr Kevin Maxwell, who was a trustee of both pension schemes at the time.
It is believed that the requests for the return of the assets depend on two
questions raised by both schemes: first, whether Goldman Sachs could be
branded a 'constructive trustee' with a specific duty to safeguard scheme
assets, and second, whether it obtained formal authorisation from the full
trustee boards of both schemes to act on instructions of individual trustees
for certain kinds of activities.
Neither Goldman Sachs nor trustees to the two schemes would comment on
whether they had discussed the assets, but it is believed that talks are in
preliminary stages.
To date the Cuckney trust has raised only Pounds 6m from some City firms
which had business dealings with Mr Maxwell. Auditors have found a total of
Pounds 440m missing from pension schemes controlled by Mr Robert Maxwell.
In June Goldman Sachs was fined Pounds 160,000 by the Securities and Futures
Authority for breaches of UK securities rules in connection with the Maxwell
affair.

FT  12 JUL 93 / Visa plans small payments cross-border service
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VISA INTERNATIONAL, the credit card group, plans to launch a new service
allowing individuals and small companies to make payments across borders in
Europe next year, after testing the idea with a group of banks in 10
countries this autumn.
The Visa transfer system, which will compete with the Swift system
established by European banks 16 years ago, comes amid signs of growing
competition in the hitherto small market for low value cross-border
payments.
Visa is to use its existing data network that allows member banks to debit
others for credit card payments. Banks will for the first time be able to
credit accounts in other countries through the network, and so make
cross-border payments.
Individuals will be guaranteed safe transfer of sums from their own account
to any other European bank in the Visa network within six days. Charges and
currency exchange rates will be set by the transferring bank.
Visa will charge the transferring bank for each transaction, and believes it
can undercut transfer prices set by Swift for its network based in Brussels.
Swift is working on plans to reduce its prices through bulk transfer of
small sums.
Banks have been under pressure from the European Commission over high costs
and long delays faced by people attempting to transfer money across borders.
The Commission believes this is hindering the development of the single
market.
However, banks have started to compete more strongly for low value payments
 -defined by Visa as below Ecu2,500 (Pounds 1,930). Although only 1 per cent
of non-cash payments currently cross borders, this is expected to grow.
Visa believes its transfer services will mainly attract individuals, but it
also plans to gain business from small companies such as retailers making
value added transfer tax refunds to customers in other countries.
Mr Patrick Bowden, Visa's European marketing director, said the company
believed there was 'an excellent opportunity' to provide a cheaper, clearer
and more reliable service than individuals are currently offered by European
banks.
Mr Bowden said the Visa service would probably allow most payments to
transfer within four days, but would guarantee a six-day transfer. He said
it would also guarantee a clear quotation of charges and exchange rates at
the start.
Royal Bank of Scotland is planning a corporate launch of its Ibos transfer
system run with Credit Commercial de France, Banco Santander in Spain and
Banco de Commercio e Induistria in Portugal. Ibos offers virtually instant
transfer.
National Westminster Bank is also thought to be working on a new
cross-border payment system with Societe General of France and Commerzbank
of Germany.

FT  10 JUL 93 / Ukraine threat to keep N-arms as Russian parliament claims
port
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD and CHRYSTIA FREELAND
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW, KIEV
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE RUSSIAN parliament claimed control yesterday of the naval port of
Sevastopol, the main base of the disputed Black Sea Fleet, opening the vexed
question of control of the Ukrainian region of Crimea.
Ukrainian officials in Kiev denounced the move as 'tantamount to a
declaration of war' and said the Russian claim would make the Ukrainian
parliament more likely to assert full control over the nuclear missiles
stationed on Ukrainian territory.
A resolution 'confirming the Russian federal status of Sevastopol' was
passed by 166 votes to 1. It also decreed that the Russian government
negotiate on the use of Sevastopol as a base for a 'unified' Black Sea
fleet.
This would be a direct contradiction of the agreement between the presidents
of Russia and Ukraine to divide the fleet 50-50, a move which has angered
many Russian officers and drawn protests even from General Pavel Grachev,
the Defence Minister.
A further clause was added before the vote which demanded that the Ukrainian
government, 'in order to avoid an increase in tension', withdraw its
'special units located in the area' - that is from its own territory.
The decree gave no details of how demands for Russian possession of
Sevastopol was to be carried through - and the Russian government, as well
as Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, is likely to ignore the
decision.
Mr Dmytro Pavlychko, chairman of the parliamentary commission on foreign
affairs, warned that the stand-off over Crimea could easily escalate into 'a
situation like that in Abkhazia or the former Yugoslavia'.
He said the Ukrainian parliament could react to the Russian move by
asserting operational control over the nuclear weapons. Last week,
parliament claimed ownership of the weapons, but Ukrainian leaders insisted
they had no plans to develop positive control over the weapons on their
territory.
'The nuclear problem cannot be resolved now,' said Mr Pavlychko, one of the
main policy makers on nuclear issues. 'How can we give up our weapons to a
neighbour which is making territorial claims on us?
'Maybe now we must say we will seek operational control over the missiles on
our territory.'
American experts believe Ukraine has the know-how to assert control over the
weapons, although they fear Russia could react to Ukrainian efforts to take
control over the missiles with a pre-emptive military strike.
Mr Pavlychko said that the situation could still be defused if Mr Yeltsin
distanced himself from parliament's declaration.

THE GOVERNMENT plans to give local authorities powers to impose fees on
couples who want to adopt a child. The fees would be for 'home reports'
drawn up by social workers to assess the suitability of prospective parents.
At present authorities can charge only for reports on people who want to
adopt youngsters from abroad. These cost up to Pounds 1,500.
Mr John Bowis, health minister, said on BBC radio yesterday he expected
local authorities would charge according to what people could afford.
Mr David Blunkett, shadow health secretary, attacked the proposal. He said:
'We're in real danger of creating a check-out counter mentality rather than
a caring service.'

FT  10 JUL 93 / Murdoch abandons NY Post to its fate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Rupert Murdoch yesterday abandoned his efforts to buy the financially
crippled New York Post  - a move which seemed likely to spell the end of the
192-year-old tabloid, America's oldest continuously published newspaper.
News Corporation, the media empire headed by Mr Murdoch, said it had been
unable to agree cost savings needed to guarantee the paper's survival in
negotiations with the paper's 11 unions.
The Post has been operating for four months under the protection of the
bankruptcy court and News Corporation has been managing the business since
March 29, pending negotiations with the court on a purchase price.
However, on Tuesday News Corporation served notice on the court that it
would walk away from the management contract at 4pm yesterday unless the
unions agreed to the cost-cutting concessions it had been demanding.
Mr Patrick Purcell, president of its News America Publishing subsidiary,
announced shortly after 4pm that the concessions had not been forthcoming
and 'News Corp has no choice but to cancel our management agreement. It is a
sad day for all of us.'
Staff were told no paper would be published today and they should clear
their desks before the Post building was padlocked.
Asked whether News Corporation might reconsider its position if the unions
suddenly caved in, a spokesman for Mr Murdoch said: 'News Corporation,
they're gone.'
The fate of the Post will now be decided in the bankruptcy courts. Unless an
alternative buyer emerges, which seems unlikely, the court will have little
choice but to liquidate the business.
Mr Murdoch was hailed as a last-chance saviour when he took over management
of the Post in March after months of uncertainty over the paper's finances
and ownership.
The paper is still losing money heavily - over Dollars 300,000 (Pounds
200,000) a week, according to News Corporation  - and the demise of New
York's smallest but raciest tabloid would give breathing space to its rivals

FT  10 JUL 93 / US warns Iraqis in missiles row
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROGER MATTHEWS, Middle East Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton told Iraq yesterday that he viewed as 'serious' its
refusal to allow United Nations inspectors to install cameras on two missile
test sites, but appeared to rule out unilateral US action if Baghdad did not
comply.
A team of UN weapons inspectors is due in Iraq today to seal the two test
sites while negotiations continue over the introduction of cameras.
Questioned at a press conference in Tokyo, Mr Clinton said Iraq was
violating UN resolutions. If it persisted, the US would take the issue back
to the UN Security Council and seek the appropriate multilateral response.
Mr Clinton contrasted the present standoff over the missile test sites with
his response to an alleged Iraqi attempt on the life of former President
George Bush, when he ordered a unilateral military strike on Baghdad.
Mr Warren Christopher, the US secretary of state, meanwhile stressed that
the use of further force against Iraq was 'entirely possible' unless Baghdad
complied with UN directives. In a television interview in Tokyo, he said
there was a pattern of Iraqi violations that could lead to further coalition
strikes.
US efforts to block the military ambitions of both Iraq and Iran were
underlined yesterday in Brussels when Mr Edward Djerejian, assistant
secretary of state for near eastern affairs, urged the EC to put pressure on
Tehran to drop any plans for developing nuclear, chemical and biological
weapons.
Iran announced last weekend it had reached agreement with China to buy a
300MW nuclear power station but both countries stressed it would be used
only for peaceful purposes.
Mr Djerejian said his Brussels meeting was designed to build on recent talks
between Mr Christopher and EC foreign ministers in which they discussed
joint action to contain Iran.
The US is also urging its allies to limit trade and technical co-operation
with Iran, which it considers to be the foremost sponsor of international
terrorism.
Iran has been attempting to improve its international relations,
particularly with the EC, in order to acquire the financial and
technological aid needed to rebuild its economy after the eight-year war
with Iraq.

FT  10 JUL 93 / US-Japanese trade deal caps Tokyo summit
</HEADLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US and Japan this morning reached agreement on a broad negotiating
framework designed to open Japan's markets to American goods and to reduce
the size of its bilateral Dollars 50bn trade surplus.
The agreement, only concluded after all-night bargaining, appears to crown a
successful summit in Tokyo of the world's largest industrialised nations for
President Bill Clinton.
Earlier, leaders of the Group of Seven had given the 'highest priority' to
concluding the Uruguay Round of international trade negotiations.
Mr Clinton and Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the Japanese prime minister, jointly
announced their resolution in brief statements.
Shortly before, the president had held a brief press conference with
President Boris Yeltsin, in which he said the US and Russia would propose a
tripartite agreement to persuade Ukraine to give up its nuclear weapons.
Neither the US nor the Japanese leader were immediately specific about the
details. Mr Miyazawa said, generally, that Japan would expand access to its
markets, increase the transparency of its policy-making and promote
deregulation in return for continued progress in reducing the US budget
deficit.
Mr Clinton said the framework approach - in his words, 'a good beginning' -
meant a series of 'results-oriented' agreements to be negotiated
sector-by-sector over the next six months. He mentioned cars,
telecommunications, computers, medical equipment, financial services and
insurance.
A US official characterised the accord as giving the US rather more than it
expected in setting numerical targets for opening up specific Japanese
sectors to US products and services. But Japan had resisted some US
macro-economic demands.
Concluding their three-day economic summit, the G7 members  - the US, Japan,
Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada  - yesterday
supported a fresh effort to reach agreement by the end of this year in the
Uruguay Round of multilateral trade talks under the aegis of the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
A communique also said they had agreed to promote long-term growth by trying
to co-operate in reforming labour markets, social security and health-care
systems.
Earlier, Mr Clinton said: 'All of us are mindful that we have a long way to
go to restore real growth and opportunity to the global economy, but we have
made a serious start.'.
He cited Wednesday's agreement by the US, Canada, Japan and the European
Community to reduce or eliminate import tariffs on a range of manufactured
goods, which he said would help bring global trade talks to a successful
conclusion.
On Russia, Mr Clinton said the Dollars 3bn programme to help privatise
state-owned industries 'will not only bolster prospects for freedom there,
it is a very solid investment for the US'.
Mr John Major, the British prime minister, said the summit, with its
progress on trade, had been better 'than I anticipated and better than most
people expected'.

FT  10 JUL 93 / Private View: Change of keeper for the giant panda
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTIAN TYLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE IS a toy panda for sale in the lobby, a baby gorilla and a cuddly
fruit-bat. The garden outside has been allowed to grow wild - to the
vexation of neighbours.
The office in the Swiss commuter village of Gland, mid-way between Geneva
and Lausanne, is the innocent-looking habitat of the international
secretariat of the World Wide Fund for Nature. Inside, the fur has been
flying.
A series of revelations and criticisms over the past five years have clouded
the reputation of the world's biggest wildlife charity. Tired of the battle,
Charles de Haes, director-general of the WWF, is stepping down. In his place
the trustees and their president the Duke of Edinburgh have chosen his
deputy, Dr Claude Martin, a Swiss biologist.
The conservation movement is a political jungle. Under de Haes, a
businessman originally seconded from Rothman's, the South African tobacco
company, the WWF has taken a pragmatic rather than purist line: it
negotiates with unpopular Third World governments and accepts money from
industry and official aid agencies.
But it has also been accused of wasting money, for example on an
unsuccessful panda-breeding project in China. There have been rows with
national organisations and the US branch withheld funds.
In the late 1980s a senior WWF official was involved in a freelance
operation in which British mercenaries, funded by former WWF president
Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands, were supposed to infiltrate the
rhino-horn smugglers. A cull of the rare Peruvian vicuna, agreed by the WWF,
turned out to have no scientific justification and the director-general was
accused of negotiating for the rifles.
Dr Martin seems more the tree-hugging type.
Although he inherits a salary reported to be Pounds 100,000 a year and is
proficient in the conservationist jargon - in three languages, moreover - he
has also worked in the field, which makes him popular with the staff.
He separates his domestic rubbish, drives a seven-year-old Renault and
though living only 12 minutes from the office takes the train in order to
conserve the planet's natural resources.
I asked him if he would get a limousine when he takes over in October. He
found it funny. 'A very long black one, like one of these American things
that never stop?', he laughed. 'Great]'
When I asked what changes he would be making, he retreated into bureaucratic
imprecision. He mentioned decentralisation, keeping the family of national
WWF bodies on the same track, scrutinising the value of aid agency money,
and 'the need to focus resources.' Forests are his first love and he will
accelerate the WWF's shift of emphasis away from furry animals towards their
habitats and the needs of their human occupants.
In 1991-92, the WWF's total income recovered to over SFr50bn (Pounds
22.10bn), but legacies and individual donations more than halved, falling
for the second year running. I suggested that the WWF was also losing the
war to save the animals for whose survival people give money. The panda, for
instance . . .
'But look what happened in China,' he replied. 'China does not consist only
of pandas. It is a huge country of great biodiversity. The panda for us,
besides being our emblem, was a way to become active there. Because we had
access there is a tremendous environmental debate in China today.'
So it was worth it even if the panda disappears from the wild?
'It was definitely worth embarking on. A species is very often a point of
entry into a wider conservation debate.'
Even if that species doesn't survive?
'Even if the status of a species gets worse and worse.'
He claimed the 30-year-old project to save the Bengal tiger had been a
success, becoming a forest conservation programme to help many other species
besides the tiger, whose numbers had doubled in 20 years.
Species have been dying out for millions of years, I said. Is there any
reason apart from sentiment why we should bother to preserve the ones close
to extinction?
'You know, this question is often posed to us. I think a lot of people have
confused two things. There have always been extinction rates but what we are
experiencing now is a much more man-induced change in biodiversity.'
'Biodiversity', like 'sustainable development', is a big buzz-word in the
conservation movement. It is often employed to suggest that somewhere in the
Brazilian jungle there lurks a cure for cancer. I suggested that in a world
full of laboratory medicines it was a weak argument for saving the
rainforest.
'I agree with you. For two reasons: people down there (in the rainforest)
would not preserve it for the sake of finding some strange plant. Secondly,
it falls flat on emotional grounds. Most people want to preserve tropical
forest because it means something to them, because it has a value, an
ethical value, not for some utilitarian possibility.'
But what is the real difference between human pressure and a giant meteorite
wiping out the dinosaurs?
'In an evolutionary process one species normally is replaced by another. If
you have artificial destruction, like burning a tropical forest, everything
goes. This is really the threat to biodiversity worldwide, that there might
be a much faster breakdown not just of species numbers, but whole
eco-systems. What happens if the marine eco-system breaks down?'
Our children are environmental militants, I said. You have been brainwashing
them and they give you money. Shouldn't you be teaching them about birth
control, not saving tigers and pandas?
'We are not the International Planned Parenthood Federation. On the other
hand we are making the link quite clearly to population numbers', Martin
replied. Family planning did not work unless people had stable livelihoods,
which in turn depended on managing their resources.
'I studied forest conservation in west Africa. You start to realise this
layer of vegetation is not just a kind of living space or a place where
people can hunt and gather, it is far more. It is a part of their culture.
It becomes equivalent to social stability in their whole community. This is
extremely interesting.'
I am sure it is interesting, I said, but the truth is most people don't live
in forests. They live in slums on the edge of cities, or they are migrating
to cities.
'Ninety per cent of the Indian population is rural. Yours is very much the
perception of a tourist who sees Delhi and Bombay. The majority of the
African population is rural.'
Aren't you trying to stop the evolutionary clock and at the same time arrest
what the Third World sees as development - factories, houses, cities?
'We are not against that. It's wrong to say we trying to halt evolution or
that we want to preserve the world as a huge museum.'
I asked Martin why, if local people's interests were important, the WWF had
supported the ban on the ivory trade. He said the decision was practical not
theological. Few African countries could control the culling of their
elephants.
Talking to local people about land management is one thing, I said, but
persuading the Chinese not to buy tigers' penises or the Japanese not to
kill whales is another.
'This is the linchpin of the whole ivory debate. You can't possibly talk to
every Chinese and convince him with education programmes.' The only hope was
to persuade governments: Japan had been persuaded to ban ivory and China had
said it might restrict some as yet unspecified imports.
Was there a moral imperative to save the environment?
Martin replied that apocalyptic forecasts, the product of 'linear thinking',
had been discredited. In the late 1970s he had forecast that by 1990 there
would not be a tree left standing in Malaysia.
'So a lot of people stopped looking in a statistical way. Our position is a
moral one. We have a responsibility not just for humans' sake but for what
people perceive as being the Creation.'
You mean, your new pitch is 'our figures may be all wrong but our moral
message is wonderful'?
Martin laughed amiably. 'No, that would be too extreme. We are talking of
the ethics of conservation.'
What is the moral justification for saving the angonoka tortoise?
'It would be inappropriate if I said that's the solution to saving the
world. It is a very tiny bit of it.'
How does it contribute to the bigger solution?
'It enables us to establish possibilities how to save species in general. My
first project was similar.'
After the University of Zurich, Martin went to Kanha National Park in
central India to save the Barasingha deer.
'I got engaged in a fascinating ecological problem which took me far beyond
the deer but in the end provided a solution to save that species as well. A
species disappearing is only the tip of the iceberg. Once you have an
understanding of what goes wrong you can do many more things. The result was
a total review of the management of all the forest areas in central India.'
So where a species dies out under pressure from man, its disappearance is a
symptom of an ailment in the system which will damage man himself?
'Ultimately, yes.'
During a two-day retreat at Assisi in 1986 the WWF got declarations of
support from leaders of five world religions. Martin described himself as a
non-religious biologist, adding: 'Even with the most fantastic evolutionary
theories you can't explain everything. So Creation is a very useful
substitute. This is where I believe this feeling of moral obligation comes
from.'
So the real impetus of the movement is an ethical one?
'I think there is an ethical imperative for conservation. When I was dealing
with tropical forests it struck me that people here, mostly never having
been in a tropical rainforest, have an extremely strong emotional tie to the
notion of a fantastic tropical world full of species. They almost have a
tropical forest in their own belly.
'You can ask why. It has to do with childhood, with fantasies. Fantasy is an
extremely important question: maybe there was at some time an evolutionary
tie of humanity to forests. There is something very, very special about the
notion of forests.'
Was that your primary motivation?
'Difficult to say. Yes, I had fantasises as a child. I had dreams of
far-away places, adventure. But I also had parents who were out-door people
and knew a lot about nature and species.'
Is this ethic what keeps you sitting at your desk?
'It's certainly a strong motivation. But I also believe we can show how the
world's resources can be conserved.'
Claude Martin is an optimist. It will need more than optimism to put the fur
back on the panda.

FT  10 JUL 93 / As They Say in Europe: Budapest-sur-Seine
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SUDDENLY, people are talking about their holidays. Suddenly, the thought
struck me that at every destination will be a disappointment.
This idea germinated while watching the recent British television series
Maigret where the eponymous detective pursued malefactors round Paris and,
sometimes, France.
In order to obtain that 1950s' feeling, it was shot in Hungary. The last
time Britons recreated Simenon's hero they wisely ensured all outdoor scenes
took place on foggy winter nights.
Today, however, verisimilitude has to take more sophisticated forms, so on
this occasion we were given a peep of the broad sweep of the Danube, which
masqueraded as the Seine, while the 19th century Gothic parliament will have
been taken for Notre Dame only by the untravelled or the drunk.
In the old days they used west European settings to recreate communist, or
even Nazi-occupied, Europe. I have seen Wandsworth town hall give a passable
performance as the headquarters of the East German communist party and I
think, once, the KGB.
Dundee gained critical acclaim for its role as Moscow in An Englishman
Abroad. Liverpool has starred as Leningrad and, in an inspired piece of
casting Bath, or maybe Cheltenham, took the part of 1939 Warsaw. (Cotswold
and Somerset stone matches that used in Nowy Swiat, the main shopping street
in the Polish capital.)
Now the traffic goes the other way, a process which in fact started long
before the collapse of communism. The Czechs offered a town ruined by
pollution in northern Bohemia as a film set for the second world war, which
saved on demolition costs.
But things are now getting out of hand. French television, I read in Le
Monde's radio and television guide, is making a series about the life of
Karl Marx: 'You descend the tortuous little street, lined with shops  - to
the left a Greengrocer, to the right a Pawnshop . . . We are in the middle
of Soho, in London.'
It turns out that we are in fact in Prague. The French production team chose
the Czech capital because it was cheap. But Prague as London] Could that
series ever be shown in Britain without arousing profound scepticism? Could
Maigret be shown in France?
Nowhere in that country is there to be found that nasty colour I think of as
Habsburg yellow, nor those bright green shutters of the Hungarian
countryside.
Will there now be tourists looking for those curious features in France and
feeling that somehow the French have got it all wrong?
This may be a roundabout way of making the familiar point that today the
fake has more impact than the real. I recall American tourists in Bad
Wimpfen in Baden-Wurttemburg who were disappointed to discover that this
archetypal Hansel-and-Gretel gingerbread town was for real and not the bit
of Disneyland it should have been.
But there is more to it than that. There is the problem of the way public
images can infect the way we see places. Provence has gained a new and
horrid haze for the British because of a television series based on the
celebrated A Year in Provence by Peter Mayle who recounted his experiences
among local 'characters.'
They now doubtless try to supply Mayle-ordered local colour to tourists who
flock there by the thousand.
On the other hand there are the benefits of seeing the familiar through new
eyes. I collect foreign tourism-related articles about Britain.
This started when I saw a photograph in a German paper of a picnic so
idyllic that it must have been the inspiration for some dejeuner-sur-l'herbe
masterpiece. But the caption told me it was Wiltshire, by the Kennet canal.
Thanks to the weekend colour section of the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung I
am now reconciled to the Scottish Highlands.
The German gift for black-and-white photography reversed a prejudice based
on a profound distaste for the publicity placed by the Highland and Islands
authority in London underground trains. This portrays a ghastly sun-drenched
livid mountain greenery. The FAZ banished all Mediterranean pretension. A
friend from that part of the world remarked: 'That's the first time I've
seen Eilean Donan castle taken from the right angle.'
The text was corny but interesting, revolving around the song about taking
the the low road and being in Scotland first.
But it linked one Eileen of the Buchanan Highland Hotel near Loch Lomond
with Buchanan County, Missouri, and told a good story of Scottish social
history.
The cover picture of two children and a sheepdog was captioned: 'Right on
the edge of Europe where there are still sea monsters and the unlimited
dreams of children: there lie the Scottish Highlands.' I liked that.
What a pity it is, then, that if German television were now to remake
Schiller's Maria Stuart they would undoubtedly film it in Ukraine.

FT  10 JUL 93 / Kow-towing to the Chinese: The historical context of Douglas
Hurd's visit to Beijing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DOMINIC LAWSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DOUGLAS Hurd is a man with a keen sense of history, so I imagine that he is
well aware of the historical echoes resonating around his current visit to
Beijing. It is 200 years, almost to the month, since the first attempt by
the British government to establish relations with China.
While Hurd was meeting only his opposite number, the Chinese foreign
minister, Qian Qichen, his predecessor of 1793, Lord Macartney, sought
nothing less than an audience with the emperor, the 83-three-year-old
Qianlong. Macartney wished to open China to British trade, and to establish
a British embassy in the Celestial Kingdom. Hurd merely aspires to smooth
over the difficulties in negotiating the condition in which Britain hands
Kong Kong back to China.
Macartney had a much bigger incentive than Hurd will ever be given for
diplomatic breakthrough. King George III had promised him an earldom if the
mission was a success. Macartney failed, because he omitted to do something
which the British foreign office has since learnt well.
He refused to kowtow to the emperor. The kowtow, as Qianlong's mandarins
attempted to teach the British emissary, involved kneeling and prostrating
before the emperor, not once but nine times. Macartney proposed that he
should treat the emperor as he would his own sovereign: stoop on one knee
and kiss hands. This suggestion outraged the court of the Manchu emperor. In
particular, the idea that anyone should dare to touch Qianlong was
blasphemous.
Macartney believed he was representing a sovereign of similar stature to the
Chinese ruler. Indeed, in terms of geographical extent if not population,
the British empire was greater than China's. What Macartney failed to
understand was that the Manchu court considered China, the Middle Kingdom,
the only true sovereign power on earth; the emperor was the earth's divinely
appointed ruler. Any other potentate could aspire only to the status of
vassal. Macartney and the other 700 members of the British delegation, were
'paying tribute' to their true ruler.
So when Macartney referred to George III as Qianlong's 'friend and brother,'
the Chinese Emperor told his mandarins that this was 'unpardonable
nonsense.' Macartney finally left Chinese waters in 1794, angry and
disillusioned, although he was fortunate, perhaps, not to have experienced
the fate of the first Portuguese ambassador to China, who had died in a
Chinese prison, having been convicted of 'disrespect for customs.'
By 1839, nothing had changed. When the Chinese finally stirred themselves to
impound opium which the British were attempting to export to China, the
mandarin responsible, governor-general Lin Tse-hsu, wrote to Queen Victoria:
'Honourable chieftanness - We have heard that in your honourable barbarian
country the people are not permitted to inhale the drug. How can your
seeking profit by exposing others to its malefic power be reconciled with
the decrees of heaven? You should immediately have the plant picked up by
the very roots . . .
'Then not only will the people of the Celestial Kingdom be delivered from an
intolerable evil, but your own barbarian subjects will be safeguarded
against temptation. On receipt of this letter let your reply be speedy,
advising us of the measures you propose to adopt. Do not evade or
procrastinate. Earnestly reflect hereon. Earnestly obey. And then,
displaying a devout sense of duty and a clear apprehension of celestial
principles, you will have the approbation of the great sages, and Heaven
will ward away from you all calamities.'
Lord Palmerston kept this corker of a letter from Queen Victoria. Within two
years, however, the Manchu empire got a response. The emperor's summer
palace was sacked by a British force and Britain seized Hong Kong as a base
for the export of opium into China.
Now Hurd, barbarian emissary of honourable chieftanness Elizabeth II, is in
Beijing trying to hand Hong Kong back in a manner acceptable to the court of
Deng Xiaoping. I hope he has packed his knee pads.

FT  10 JUL 93 / Hawks &amp; Handsaws: Order out of chaos
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL THOMPSON-NOEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I WAS sitting at my screen this week, fossicking through the message basket,
when one of the corporate elders stole up behind me and hovered at my elbow.
I could tell he was an elder because he wore a grey suit and tie and a pair
of black spectacles. His expression was churchly. He said he had something
for me, and handed me an envelope that contained a copy of a new book, the
Financial Times Style Guide.
He said: This is the new style book. You are the first person to receive one
because you are in the vanguard, as it were, or possibly the van, of our
core target audience, if you will pardon the solecism.
I said: What is a solecism?
He said: Oh, very funny. Seriously, Michael, there are those of us who feel
that if we can get you to read it, to look upon it fondly, not, perhaps,
follow it down all of its tributaries but at least meander through it, when
commitments permit, then our struggle is half-won. Your help is essential
pour encourager les autres.
I said: Les enfants?
He said: Exactly. Junior members of staff. The raw and the impressionable.
They must read Hawks &amp; Handsaws sometimes and wonder, style-wise, whether
they are in topsy-turvy land. Wilfulness and wickedness. Fantasy and worse.
Sentences starting And. Sentences without verbs. Sentences and paragraphs
without anything whatsoever. Tricksy experimentalism, at least in FT terms.
I said: How will the Style Guide help me?
He said: By creating order out of chaos. It is on the side of writers. It
states, at the outset, as a caution to sub-editors: 'One result of the
paperless office . . . is that it is all too easy to force stories into a
sort of uniformity of style, removing any individuality and elegance they
might have possessed. Good writing should be recognised - and left as it
is.' Beyond that, Michael, it seeks to encourage writers to write accurately
and clearly. It highlights recurring errors and contains glossaries of
financial, scientific and technical terms. It is a useful and powerful tool.
Clarity is essential. Let me give you an example. Under betting odds, it
says that in a sentence such as odds were quoted of 2-1 on John Smith
becoming the next leader of the Labour party, the on can cause confusion.
Odds of 2-1 on are really 1-2, ie you place a bet of Pounds 2 and get back
Pounds 1 plus the stake if you win. With odds of 2-1 (against), your Pounds
2 bet will recoup Pounds 4 plus the stake. It is therefore important to make
the precise odds clear: 1-2 (on) or 2-1 (against).
I said: I am afraid that isn't true. You have forgotten betting tax, which
is 10 per cent of winnings and stake. At 1-2 you would pay 30p tax and get
back Pounds 2.70; at 2-1 you would pay 60p tax and get back Pounds 5.40.
He said: Do not quibble. More important than betting odds is our campaign
against cliches and tired language. We sampled a year's issues of the FT and
found seven villains of the piece, nine people who patched together a
compromise, 45 who hammered out something, 20 who put something up for
grabs, 28 who found it crystal clear, 95 who went back to square one, 161
who played a key role, 86 appearances at this moment in time, 145 who saw a
green light, 135 who were beleaguered, and 33 who sent shock waves through
something; 31 were tight-lipped, 27 events surprised the City though only
four shocked it, and 20 people had played a waiting game, as 45 were quick
to point out.
Further analysis turned up 97 bonanzas, 910 booms, 223 bottom lines, 418
breakthroughs, 87 clampdowns, 6,472 crises, 293 crackdowns, 148 cutbacks,
269 elites, 852 giants, 1,889 run-ups and 5,122 problems. All we are asking
you to do, Michael, is read it.
And then he whispered away, his grey form merging into the grey corporate
decor. So I read it. And enjoyed it. It is a considerably useful tool. You
can buy it from the FT for Pounds 11, (p&amp;p included). Here are four
snippets:
Plane is used to shave wood; what you fly in is an aircraft, jet, airliner,
helicopter, etc.
Eponymous. Many readers will not know what it means. Avoid it.
Expletives. The FT has no strict policy. However, gratuitous use is
discouraged. The word wanker has appeared only once in the FT; it was a
misprint for banker.
Blobs. An average issue of the FT contains 30-40 blobs . . . Think carefully
about whether the blob has any useful function.

FT  10 JUL 93 / Arts: Relationships and real life - Radio
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By B A YOUNG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SPECIAL relationship was modestly observed by the BBC on Independence
Day Sunday. Radio 2 had Stars and Stripes Forever, about John Philip Sousa,
with lots of pretty marches; Radio 4 had an American morning service; Radio
3 included naturalised-American Korngold in its morning concert and made him
Composer of the Week. Peter Franklin gave a talk about him with music
sounding like film-scores, though only one of them was.
What if . . . ? is Radio 4's real-life SF, imaginative conjectures of life
if various important matters had ended differently. Last week, Philip
Ziegler and David Cannadine considered the chimerical reign of King Edward
VIII. We should have probably had Queen Wallis, possibly Prince Simpson and
Princess Wallis; but we might have had Queen Thelma (nee Furness). Lloyd
George would perhaps have been prime minister, with Churchill in his
cabinet, but the royal influence would have prevented war with Hitler's
Germany. The Duke of York would have been found an appointment in Ottawa or
Canberra.
This week, we envisaged a more likely, so less interesting, matter, that Mrs
Thatcher remained prime minister in 1990. I say 'less interesting' because
the business discussed by Lord Gilmour and Roy Hattersley is but the shadow
of today's problems as we see them; though they may be right that there
would have been less enthusiasm for the Gulf War. Major would still have
been chancellor, the Maastricht Treaty would have been accepted, Social
Chapter and all.
Less likely affairs in later programmes make for more curious arguments.
Next Tuesday, a Jew, a Moslem and a Christian will wonder how we should have
progressed if Jesus had been released instead of Barabas; and on Tuesday
week we consider the possibility of life on Mars.
Not a brilliant week for drama. Radio 3's Sunday play was a repeat of Martyn
Wade's Burn the Aeneid. Roman experts with names in 'new pronunciation' had
been charged by Virgil in his will to destroy this manuscript. Their
troubles, and the plot, are eased by a simple last-minute discovery - slight
but fun for those who care about Virgil.
Radio 4's Saturday play was another 'movie'; I was hearing Boris Godunov
elsewhere. Monday afternoon offered Scarlet on Black, which I gave up as
soon as I found it wasn't Le Rouge et le Noir but a modern French crime
story; and Monday evening was Marilyn Morris's Fit to be Tied, about four
women working in a cake-shop making everyday chat. Tuesday's Thirty Minute
Theatre, Disconnected, by Anthony George, dealt with a railway accident; one
passenger had a mobile phone that called up the future, too slight a novelty
to make up for the otherwise conventional talk. However, the two
quasi-political serials, The House, by Christopher Lee, and Safe in Our
Hands, by Colin Douglas (about the NHS), are doing well.
Radio 5 has good serials, too, even when they only last two days. This week,
we had A Very Wicked Headmistress, by Margaret Mahy. The school that she is
headmistress of lies next to a farm where a volcanic eruption has mixed
eggs, milk and sugar-beet into a lake of lumpy custard, the lumps being
diamonds. The nymphomaniac farmer falls madly for the headmistress, she for
the diamonds, but a farmboy and three sixth-form girls destroy all hopes of
happy success. You don't believe a word? You haven't heard Stephanie Cole
reading it. It was hilarious.
Then The Chocolate Touch, by Patrick Skene Catling: John Midas (of Greek
extraction?) finds a weird sweetshop where he is given a chocolate fetish;
it makes everything he touches turn into chocolate, including his
toothpaste, breakfast, gloves, pencil - and mother. But all is well. The
sweetshop man provides a remedy and then his shop disappears. Philip
Hawthorn read this, with some dodgy accents.

FT  10 JUL 93 / Arts: The decade of decadence - Patricia Morison enjoys an
exhibition of the languid and rather naughty Nineties
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICIA MORISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ANYONE WHO grew up in the late 1960s may well find the latest exhibition at
London's Victoria and Albert museum powerfully nostalgic. High Art and Low
Life: The Studio and the Fin de Siecle offers a richly textured account of
the decade which has etched a clearer image of itself than any other.
During my sixth-form years, spent still in the back-wash of the 1960s, the
1890s held a deep fascination. Our tragic heroes were Rimbaud, Oscar Wilde,
and Aubrey Beardsley. The latter supplied favourite images, together with
posters by Toulouse Lautrec and Mucha, and postcards of Moreau and the
Belgian Symbolists.
It had all seemed a long time ago - until this exhibition. But now, with so
much of the look of the 1960s back on the streets, it seems possible that
fin-de-siecle decadence may yet be resurrected for our end-of-century.
Indeed, the exhibition reminds us of the V&amp;A's key role in stimulating the
cult of the 1890s, first with the 1963 Mucha exhibition which brought Art
Nouveau roaring back into fashion, then the Beardsley exhibition of 1966.
There are other straws in the wind. At the Almeida, a new opera deals with
the life of Rimbaud. This autumn the Barbican will stage an exhibition of
Mucha, who as a Czech nationalist is perhaps even more likely to captivate a
younger generation than last time round. Easy parallels present themselves
between the 1990s and the 1890s. To name but one, Ibsen on syphilis has
become horribly topical.
Interestingly, the V&amp;A's exhibition looks beyond the languid exponents of
decadence. In this, it takes its cue from the character of the influential
Studio magazine, launched exactly 100 years ago. The magazine was
established to promote 'advanced' taste in furnishings, decoration and the
fine arts, but it was never intended to shock. It lay on the occasional
tables of people who would never have read the notorious Yellow Book.
Nonetheless, 'low life' figures found in the magazine a showcase for their
talents. The 21-year-old Beardsley was responsible for designing the cover
of the first issue of The Studio. Within its green wrappers was to be found
'The Climax', his famous illustration for Salome. Wilde loved it.
Also contained in this first issue were Baron Von Gloeden's photographs of
young Sicilian boys - with and without togas. The baron's work still sells
well at the bookshop in Taormina, congregating ground for the international
gay set. Even so, it is just possible that to an innocent Victorian,
photographs like these could have appeared as no more than a stunning
recreation of ideal Grecian beauty.
The designs of Voysey and Ashbee were much promoted by the Studio and are
prominent in the exhibition. Among the artists featured are Charles Conder,
famous for paintings on silk, also Frank Brangwyn, Arthur Melville,
Whistler, and the inseparable Ricketts and Shannon - Marigold and Orchid, as
Wilde nicknamed them. It was a great age of beautifully bound and
illustrated books. Would Pooter and Sherlock Holmes have been such a hit
without their illustrations?
The show marks the relaunch of Studio International, successor to Studio.
Its catalogue forms part of a centenary edition which also contains
stimulating essays on aspects of the 1890s such as the New Woman, 'the Love
which dare not speak its name', the colours of decadence, and smoking. This
was the era of Smoking Concerts, advertised by posters on which trails of
smoke lent themselves perfectly to the sinuous style of Art Nouveau.
Aesthetes and Hearties united in extolling the pleasures of smoking. On the
one hand, it was manly, for as Kipling observed: 'A woman is only a woman,
but a good cigar is a smoke.'
A cigarette was also an essential prop to decadence, drooping between the
fingers of the 'Greenery-yallery, Grosvenor Gallery, foot-in-the-grave young
man.' Less familiar than W. S. Gilbert's jokes about the aesthetes is the
following vicious characterisation of their tastes which Kipling gives to a
dying father addressing his Old Harrovian son:
'The things that I knew was proper, you wouldn't thank me to give
And the things I knew was rotten, you said was the way to live
For you muddled with books an' pictures, and' china an' etchings an' fans,
And your rooms at college was beastly, most like a whore's than a man's'
For anyone who nurtures an affection for the Nineties, this exhibition is a
treat.
* * * Thomas Gambier Parry is pretty dull, at the Courtauld Institute in
London (until September 1, then to Cheltenham Art Gallery). Gambier Parry
(1816-88) was a clever, wealthy High Church aesthete. He collected Italian
primitives at an unusually early period and some fine pieces of Islamic art.
Most of this collection his grandson presented to the Courtauld, so the
exhibition is by way of a laudatio.
Gambier Parry's competent but boring watercolours are on view, also his
diaries. In the rarified world of Victorian ecclesiology, he is a notable
figure for his invention of a special technique for wall-paintings. You will
find his paintings on the roof of Ely Cathedral and at the church he built
at Highnam in Gloucestershire, dedicated to the Holy Innocents in memory of
two dead Parry children. The church sounds well worth a visit and possibly -
since it needs money - a cheque. The church is three miles from Gloucester
on the B4215 road; tel. 0452-412341/25567 for keys.

FT  10 JUL 93 / Arts: Lily-livered executioner - Off the Wall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Arts Council is proving a maladroit executioner. On Thursday it was set
to freeze the blood, to announce the arts companies that would have their
grants withdrawn following the Council's new policy of backing winners and
removing support from the mundane.
Already the rumour factory had reduced the number of victims to around 10,
but it was made clear that drama would be badly hit. On Wednesday the drama
panel at the Council threatened mass resignations. On Thursday the Council
announced that there would be more consultations.
There is nothing wrong with the Council finally daring to wield the axe. In
the past, once you became a client you were on a permanent gravy train. But
it is going about the business in a hopeless fashion. For a start it is
planning to give most of the Pounds 1.4m saved from the drama budget to
contemporary dance and visual art. If the public had a choice it would
surely favour saving its local theatres rather than funding such minority
art forms more lavishly.
Presenting even more cause for concern are the names rumoured to be on the
hit list - the theatres at Plymouth, Oldham, Coventry, Watford, Greenwich,
and the Lyric Hammersmith, all of whom have recently presented excellent
work. Given the box office recession, and the financial problems of local
authorities, their future would be in jeopardy if their grants were
withdrawn.
It gets worse. The Council is threatened with a 2 per cent, or Pounds 5m,
cut in its own grant by the government in 1994-95. Is this the time for the
Council to impose additional misery on the arts world? And it seems confused
in its judgments. It suggests that if the government comes up with more
money than anticipated then some of the doomed theatres might get their
cash. This makes a nonsense of the argument that they have been chosen for
closure for artistic failings.
The Arts Council also shows its lack of relish for blood letting by choosing
an outsider, Sir Leonard Hoffman, to do its dirty work on the London
orchestras. The Council wants to save the Pounds 400,000 subsidy it gives to
the RPO. It wants the LPO and the Philharmonia to merge into a slightly
enlarged band based on the South Bank, giving London two top-flight
orchestras. (The other would be the LSO at the Barbican). This is the
formula that Sir Leonard will be expected to recommend to the Council.
Finally, the Council is behaving shabbily over the popular and successful
Glyndebourne Touring Opera. It has asked it to apply annually for grants
from 1995-96 and stipulates that these will be confined to visits to medium
sized theatres such as Plymouth (if it is still in business) and Norwich.
But Glyndebourne prefers to play bigger venues and its productions are often
ill-designed for smaller stages. The Council seems to have a vendetta
against southern-based opera companies. One of the few clients it has killed
off was Kent Opera. Now it has Glyndebourne Touring in its sights. It is all
very strange.
                          *       *       *
'Sensational' was the word when an early 19th century calculator, which was
estimated to sell for around Pounds 15,000, was bid up to Pounds 7.7m at
Christie's in London on May 19. It was an unprecedented event in any auction
room.
So how do you describe the subsequent events - super-sational? The
successful bidder, the well-respected Swiss dealer Edgar Mannheimer, has
failed to pay up during the official 30-day period. This is just about
understandable: he could have crossed wires with a big collector who
subsequently decided that he did not want to go that high.
However, the most intriguing aspect of the affair is the behaviour of the
under-bidder who was, in theory, representing a German museum. The museum
says that its top budget for an acquisition is Pounds 200,000.
There is no sense to it all. That is why there are wild rumours in the
antiques trade of a dealer who is very ill but who wants to leave his mark
on the business to enter antiques history. But he would have to persuade a
friend to co-operate on chasing up the price of a rare but not unique object
to incredible heights. This seems less likely.
The most sensible explanation is that whatever Mannheimer's motives, the
under-bidder got carried away by atmosphere and Teutonic pride carried him
into the stratosphere. It is bad news for the vendor, who went on holiday to
celebrate his extraordinary coup. It is less bad news for Christie's which,
as agent, does not have to recompense him with Pounds 7.7m. But somehow one
cannot see a long legal case materialising with the vendor trying to extract
Pounds 7m from the 'buyer'.
If the German museum still wants an early 19th century calculator, well,
Sotheby's is offering what it considers to be a similar example on October
7. It is keeping its feet on the ground with an estimate of Pounds 200,000,
just what the museum can afford.
                          *       *       *
All those cynics who have dubbed the Department of National Heritage, the
Department of Nothing Happening, need only wait another nine months. By then
Peter Brooke, the minister, will be in a position to amaze us with his
energy.
Brooke, a politician and a gentleman if ever the two can twin, takes a
relaxed, long term view of his job. He spent his first nine months mugging
up his brief and at the end of the next nine anticipates that he will have
enough data for decisions to be made. He seems quite ready to switch
resources in his Pounds 1bn balliwick from sports to arts, or from heritage
to broadcasting if the evidence favours drastic change. Brooke believes that
it requires a long stint at a job to be effective. Let us hope that the PM
thinks the same.
Brooke is not bullish about the prospects for the arts and heritage in the
current expenditure round. He takes comfort from the thought that the
traditional approach of giving arts organisations lavish grant increases one
year and then being forced by economic crises to take the money away the
next is as deleterious as keeping them permanently skint, the current plan.
But he does feel that he has ring-fenced National Lottery money from
Treasury predators, and if the legislation can pass through Parliament this
month then by the end of 1984 the arts and the heritage, as well as sport,
charities and the Millennium Fund, will each benefit by at least Pounds 75m
a year, with most (but not all) the extra money going on capital projects.
The sum could be as high as Pounds 200m, which would transform the UK
cultural scene.
So it seems a case of hanging on grimly for the good times. Brooke also
believes in leaving well alone, but he does not seem to think that the Arts
Council is a totally healthy organisation.

FT  10 JUL 93 / Arts: A very perky Pickwick
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE unrepentantly conservative audience at the Festival Theatre enjoys its
Chichester Knights. This season it awarded its standing ovation to Sir Harry
Secombe for walking through Pickwick, a role he created 30 years ago in Wolf
Mankowitz's musical based on Dickens' 'Immortal'.
Or perhaps it was a role created for him. Amiable, straight, unworldly,
Secombe seems to have spent most of his life auditioning for the part. Now
in his 70s he still has the face of a mischievous child, but the energy
count is inevitably diminished. He treats the show as a series of solos with
a little comic business on the side. It is hard to imagine him ruling the
Pickwick Club with a rod of iron, although the voice still commands respect
 -and the high notes.
But if Sir Harry takes it gently he is a generous ensemble player, looking
on sweetly while others pile up the points. This production could also
almost be promoted as Weller, so jauntily does David Cardy take his chances
as Pickwick's gentleman's gentleman. The stage definitely buzzes when he
dances, sings, and fools around a generously large cast. His energy rubs off
on Michael Howe as Jingle. It is a contest to see who can milk the most from
what is a fairly loose book, a canter through the familiar sketches from
Pickwick.
Jingle has the neatest cameo as he woos Alexandra Bastedo's Rachel Wardle
while removing her jewels, but Cardy gets to grin widest and longest. Even
the Pickwick Club members - Peter Land (Snodgrass); Kevin AJ Ranson (Tupman)
and Robert Meadmore (Winkle) - manage to look and sound like individuals
rather than supernumaries.
Patrick Garland's production needs to move swiftly to cover up the passing
years. You realise just how far the musical has progressed in a generation.
Lyricist Leslie Bricusse and composer Cyril Ornadel could still get away
with cheerful Cockney capers and rumpity-tumpity music which owed something
to music hall pastiche but even more to barrel organ blandness. Only the
ballads have worn well, and if 'If I ruled the world' now seems
unsupportably banal, 'Look into your heart' contains a tug on the emotions.
Pickwick also seems in danger of an appearance before the Equal
Opportunities Board. The women scarcely get a look in, although Ruth Madoc
as Mrs Bardell makes the melodramatic most of her fleeting chances. With
such a sentimental, soft-hearted, feel-good show it is perfect casting for
Roy Castle, who appeared as Sam Weller in the 1960s, to be given a cameo as
Sam's 'ancient', Tony Weller. In time Pickwick, the musical, may carry some
of the period charm of Dickens' novel. At the moment it is a glimpse into
the dark ages of the British musical. But the band played loudly; the cast
mugged it like professionals; and the audience thought that this is what the
theatre is all about.

FT  10 JUL 93 / Arts: Not so comic capers - A disappointing adaption of an
Ostrovsky play
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   THE SECOND staged offering of 'Almeida Opera'
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
the season of new and modern opera put on at the Almeida Theatre in London
by ENO's Contemporary Opera Studio - is an Ostrovsky adaptation. Nick Dear's
racy, free-wheeling translation of the first full-length Ostrovsky play, A
Family Affair (1850), was a hit when the theatre company Cheek by Jowl
revealed it to London a few years ago. The composer Julian Grant, in search
of a subject that would (in his words) mix 'sophistication and ding-dong
humour', lighted on the Dear text for his Almeida Opera commission; and this
eight-hander in three rather ill-proportioned acts is the result.
To the number of Ostrovsky-based operas already in existence - Janacek's
Katya Kabanova and Rimsky-Korsakov's Snow Maiden the best-known - this
Family Affair is, I fear, an insubstantial addition. The play, an angry
satire on bourgeois greed (given a scabrously upbeat topicality in Dear's
modern argot), would hardly seem to need music in the first place; and the
kind of music Grant has chosen for its operatic embodiment, though it
manhandles the subject with boundless energy, ends up by underlining that
point with wearying insistence.
London audiences have learned to recognise (and wring hands over) new operas
that were no more than musicked plays, or fey private rituals, or
radio-plays manques; but this is a rare example of what I can only call the
Cartoon Opera. Grant reveals a Loonie-Toons-and-Merrie-Melodies approach to
operatic comedy, that trickiest of genres, exhibiting speed, force and
hammer-blows of expressive device as his trademarks (in the tiny Almeida
Theatre the level of volume achieved on Thursday by the 12-person orchestra
often crossed the pain threshold).
The musical idiom, with chug-a-chug strings, wah-wah brass, pell-mell
screeches of woodwind and all manner of exclamation-mark punctuation, proves
itself kin to the classic cartoon-studio accompaniment. I know what Grant
means about ding-dong humour - but sophistication?
The set-pieces - aria, ensemble - arrive with clear and not unskilful
dramatic signposting; yet, since in the orchestral and vocal invention the
distinction between straight and parodied tones of dramatic voice is blurred
to the point of non-existence, the 'operatic' necessity of these formal
arrangements seems no more than gestural. The really curious thing is that,
while all the performers are worked at full stretch, an impression of
dramatic speed is an illusion increasingly dispelled during an ever more
spirit-clogging evening.
Martin Duncan, a producer who has more than once shown a nimble hand with
operatic hand, here delivers a coarse, blaring show - one can hardly blame
him for not rising above the base-level of the material, but he and the
conductor, Nicholas Kok, might at least have tried to vary vocal and
orchestral volume a bit more.
The cast contains three of the most accomplished operatic character-actors
in the land - Geoffrey Dolton (Lazar), John Graham-Hall (Rispolozhensky),
Richard Suart (Bolshov) - and several other pleasing young talents besides.
All eight work with unceasing vigour to give the opera real 'go'. They fail,
but that is hardly their fault.

FT  10 JUL 93 / Arts: Music on the move at a barnstorming festival - Richard
Fairman roves across the Schleswig Holstein landscape
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN A LARGE barn the near-capacity family audience sits in silence. Adults
occupy rows of temporary plastic seats. Children nestle in the beams. Young
and old, more than 1000 people have come to hear the concert. Their
attentiveness is all the more remarkable given the music they are hearing -
Benjamin Britten's late and concentrated Third String Quartet.
That was the scene last weekend at one of the 'musical parties' that are
such an attractive feature of the Schleswig Holstein Music Festival. For
those whose knowledge of Germany is not all that it might be it may be
helpful to place Schleswig Holstein on the map. This is the northernmost
part of Germany, bordering on Denmark. The North Sea bounds it to the West,
the Baltic to the East. The main cities are Kiel and Lubeck, the nearest
cosmopolitan centre is Hamburg.
Now fully finding its feet, the festival itself is seven years old. In a
period when so many music festivals were given birth, this one has survived
and prospered because it is different. Among its early supporters was
Leonard Bernstein, who wanted to promote a European equivalent of
Tanglewood. (Keen followers of the Proms may remember him bringing the
student Schleswig Holstein Festival Orchestra to London a few years ago.)
With its fine student orchestra, its master-classes and so many young faces
in the audience, youth is one of the features that has given the festival a
distinctive personality.
The other is the way it spreads itself generously across this whole northern
reach of the country. As an area for holidays it is favoured by Germans from
the South, while foreign tourists are most often Dutch or Scandinavian. To
visitors from England the scenery is much like home. Bernstein remarked on
the 'green countryside, farmland and . . . lordly houses', which could
easily be a description of East Anglia, the area it most closely resembles.
All this is worth mentioning, as the music is constantly on the move, from
city cathedral to manor-house, town hall to country barn, and the audience
will find that one of the pleasures of the festival is in moving with it. A
visitor is likely to discover as much about the countryside while in pursuit
of the music, as vice versa.
The all-weekend 'musical party' was at Emkendorf, north of Hamburg. In the
grounds of the local Schloss, a substantial country-house, with yellow walls
and shuttered windows, lies a group of carefully-restored 18th-century
barns. The largest is where the concert takes place. There is music for an
hour, then an hour's rest, in which parents can take restless children to
burn off their energy in the grounds. The refreshments, supplied by
sponsoring companies, included ice-cream, beer and (an unlikely choice)
champagne. Do not be fooled: Glyndebourne is many miles from what Emkendorf
is about.
One could dismiss the exercise as an up-market fun-fair, if the response to
the music had not been so wholehearted. Apart from one or two screams from
roving two-year-olds, the Arditti Quartet were given an intent hearing.
Their performance of Britten's Third Quartet, subtly coloured, poetic, gave
an eloquent apologia for the piece. Among the other performing groups were a
folksy mouth-organ ensemble and the Chamber Pop Quintett Soundmachine.
Musical snobs, like critics, can opt out and take a walk round the lake.
The night before, the Arditti had been the guests in a thoroughly adult
programme. This was at Wotersen, across country to the south east, but a
venue almost identical in charm and layout. Another Schloss, another big
barn, where 20th-century music was played Aldeburgh-style, in a fine, open
acoustic. The programme paired two Bartok quartets with a new quartet by
Peter Eotvos, a festival commission. It takes as its theme a selection of
letters by Mozart, though the connection seemed tenuous. It was the
quartet's sound-world of murmuring glissandos, as though the words of the
letters were being hummed or whispered, that constituted its real interest.
Delightful though these countryside venues are, a festival itinerary needs
to take in towns or cities as well, if it is to catch the large-scale events
with international artists. This has historically been a musical part of
Germany. Hamburg was the birthplace of Brahms and Mendelssohn. Lubeck was
the home of Buxtehude's renowned organ, no longer surviving unfortunately,
although the city, a World Heritage site, is celebrating its 850th
anniversary this year amid much fine late medieval architecture.
In Hamburg I caught the Schleswig Holstein Festival Orchestra giving its
most prestigious concert of the festival, under Georg Solti. Brahms was on
the programme in his home concert-hall; the Fourth Symphony, robust,
confident, no-nonsense music in Solti's hands, which may not be all the
symphony had to say when the composer conducted it, although the performance
worked well enough as far as it went. The student musicians certainly gave a
strong account of themselves, as they had earlier in a trenchant performance
of Stravinsky's Petrushka.
As an encore Solti and his young orchestra threw in a spectacularly fiery
Die Fledermaus Overture. It was a stifling evening, during which musicians
and audience had been melting in the heat, but as Solti remarked, 'they
played it so well this afternoon, I felt you had to hear it]' The energy did
not fail them. Among the new-born festivals of the 1980s, Schleswig Holstein
looks to be a healthy survivor, a music festival with youth on its side.
Schleswig Holstein Festival continues until August 22. Jointly sponsored by
Zentis, Die Gottinger Gruppe and Bahlsen.

FT  10 JUL 93 / Arts: Castleward rises above the Troubles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NORMA MAJOR has not often featured in the annals of Northern Irish opera.
But when, on her suggestion, the prime minister's party swept into
Castleward opera last week - on the evening when Sir Patrick Mayhew,
Northern Ireland Secretary, made his politically embarrassing joke about a
Belfast bomb explosion that injured 30 people - it marked an unexpected
boost to the little-known world of Irish opera.
Dubbed by Sir Patrick as a 'Glyndebourne without the pomp', Castle Down has
been quietly seeking to make its mark on the operatic map since the mid
1980s. Like other would-be Glyndebourne's that have grown up across England,
the venue thrives by serving up a popular mixture of pleasant opera and
black-tie social graces, staged in the stately home of Castleward, which
guests can admire during the dinner interval.
Unlike more pretentious venues, the event has not yet lost its home-made
edge - nor the politics that pervade even the arts world in Northern
Ireland. The operas are performed in a former barn, where on most nights
hefty security men lurk at the stage door, guarding civil servants in the
audience. A high profile party like the Majors means that the ornamental
gardens are thick with combat troops.
In spite of these more unusual touches, Seamus McGrenera's production of
Donizetti's Lucia di Lammermoor this year is an enjoyable performance. When
Castleward first started, nine seasons ago, it used a semi-professional cast
to stage three performance of Cosi fan tutte on a budget of Pounds 7000.
This year, 17 performances are on offer, using a budget of Pounds 140,000
drawn almost entirely from local business sponsorship - a sum which the
organisers say allows them to either pick middle-ranking established singers
for their principles, or aim for up-and-coming singers. Wisely, perhaps,
they have chosen to focus on the up-and coming elements, albeit with
slightly uneven results.
Lucia di Lammermoor is an opera in which much depends on the power of the
soprano, and the Irish-born Nicola Sharkey coped with the part of Lucia
commendably. Baritone Gordon Sandison and bass Andrew Hammond also put in
two solid performances, as Enrico and Raimondo respectively, providing a
solid anchor to the opera and counterbalancing a slight weakness in the
tenors, who had been undermined by illness.
Nevertheless, the biggest challenge for the opera remains the staging: the
barn-cum-hall where the operas are produced seats no more than 200. Director
Seamus McGrenera and designer Adam O'Neill sought to overcome the
limitations by using the levels and depths of the stage to the full, but
although the set design was impressive, it did not always entirely overcome
the problems of overcrowding or the slightly static feel to the production.
How Castleward will develop in the future is uncertain. To make its mark on
the international opera scene, critics agree that it will not only need a
new stage, but also a more specific opera niche - perhaps a focus on the
little-known repertoire of Irish opera, instead of the selection of popular
classics that the venue now serves.
However, organisers fear that taking this direction could alienate the local
audience, as well as the business sponsorship which it has carefully
cultivated over the years. 'People are not falling over themselves to go to
opera in Northern Ireland. It's basically a very conservative audience,'
says director Seamus McGrenera.
As the venue has grown on the back of local business sponsorship - a
considerable feat, given the financial climate - finding the funds for
redevelopment seems unlikely. Meanwhile, for Castleward's fans it is the
very intimacy and enthusiasm that gives the performance its charm.
'This is like Glyndebourne in the 1930s or Wexford in the 1950s. With
careful nurturing it could grow into something of significance,' says Ian
Fox, a leading Dublin critic who has been trumpeting Castle Ward's cause
south of the border.
Tickets for this year's productions rapidly sold out. And courtesy of Norma
Major, Sir Patrick Mayhew and the ensuing publicity, it seems that
competition to get tickets for next year's productions will be even more
fierce.

FT  10 JUL 93 / Arts: Rehabilitation of a wartime voice / Review of the
reputation of the poet John Heath-Stubbs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL GLOVER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'THE HUNGRY generations tread each other down,' writes the English poet John
Heath-Stubbs in Hindsights, an autobiography published this week to mark his
75th birthday. And of no generation has this been truer than his own, the
1940s, which was attacked with such vehemence by the poets of the 1950s -
Robert Conquest, Philip Larkin, Kingsley Amis and others - that only in
recent years has it been possible, thanks to the publication of the
collected poems of Norman Cameron, George Barker, Heath-Stubbs himself and
others, to judge how much truth there was in these allegations.
So what exactly was wrong with the poets of the 1940s? Irresponsibility, for
a start. Coming after the politically committed generation of the 1930s, the
1940s poets seems set apart from the world in which they lived, in both
subject matter and language. Poet Denise Levertov has called the work of
that decade 'invertebrate'. Apocalyptic, diffusely passionate, intensely
metaphorical, it seemed to lack any backbone of reasoned discourse. In their
flight from the horrors of war, these neo-romantics plunged headlong into
the abyss of themselves and often (like David Gascoyne) crawled out godly.
Two movements in the 1930s contributed to the excesses of the 1940s:
surrealism and Freudianism. Freudianism gave poets a justification for
regarding poetry as the outpourings of the Id; surrealism taught them that
the suprarational truths revealed in dreams had a power to heal the divisive
wounds of capitalism. Such a potent cocktail was bound to produce
muddled-headedness.
All this syballine frenzy struck the poets of the 1950s as repugnant and
inappropriate to the drab realities of post-war Britain. According to Robert
Conquest, editor of New Lines, one of that decade's most influential
anthologies, the poets of the new decade would be much more down-to-earth:
rational structures, comprehensible language, and a refusal to submit to
'great systems of theoretical constructs or agglomerations of unconscious
commands' would be the order of the day.
Heath-Stubbs, at Oxford in the war years and published for the first time
early in that decade, got smeared along with the rest, and his reputation
suffered. He has fought to get rid of the taint of neo-romanticism, and to
prove himself more than merely 'an ageing survivor of an
abused/Unfashionable decade'.
A Hampshire man, he grew up near the New Forest, and from his earliest years
suffered from congenital glaucoma (one eye was removed in the 1950s, the
second in the 1970s). After miserable years at Bembridge School on the Isle
of Wight he went on to Worcester College for the Blind, and from there to a
scholarship at Queen's, Oxford.
In the poetry, his poor eyesight has been more than compensated for by an
extraordinary visual and auditory imagination. He has an acute ear for the
bewildering variety of birdsong to be heard even in inner London, where he
has lived for the past 40 years. As a schoolboy in the 1930s, he was a
passionate autodidact, devouring each new volume of the Thinker's Library as
it appeared. Greatly interested in botany and natural history (see, for
example, 'Botanical Happy Families' in his new collection of poems,
Sweet-Apple Earth, Carcanet, Pounds 7.95), he possesses the intellect of a
magpie.
His best poetry is Augustan in temper, far removed from the mannered,
baroque language of George Barker or Dylan Thomas. He possesses a strong
sense of tradition. Those early years in Hampshire gave him a familiarity
with the myths surrounding the death of William Rufus at the hands of his
man-servant Tyrrel in the New Forest. Did Tyrrel kill the king by accident
or design? Or was it a ritual murder involving a witch-cult? The poem
'Purkis' probes that mystery, and also sets it in the context of a popular
children's rhyme - English history layered upon English history.
Heath-Stubbs, a great, gangling man, shock of white hair falling forward
over his face, cane gripped fiercely in both hands, reads this poem with a
powerful sense of the music of the verse, a quality which those poets of the
1950s and their impassioned successors began to help us to forget, such was
their concern to represent life as it really is.

FT  10 JUL 93 / Arts: Top dealer cashes in his lot - An upcoming bargain
basement auction in Paris
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS POWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ELEGANT field of 18th century French furniture is heading for a big
shake-up on September 28, when leading Paris specialist Camille Burgi shuts
his shop and auctions his entire stock at Drouot salerooms without a single
reserve price.
Two hundred and fifty lots of top-quality 18th and early 19th century
furniture, art objects, paintings, ceramics and sculptures will be put under
the hammer by auctioneer Jacques Tajan in one of the biggest sales of its
kind which Paris will have seen in a long time.
Burgi is selling up less than a year after opening premises at 77 Faubourg
Saint Honore - just opposite the Hotel Bristol and a prime location for an
antique dealer. Burgi has 10,000 square feet, four-storey premises complete
with a restoration workshop and employs 10 permanent staff. Painting dealer
Colnaghi is across the road, Sotheby's is just up the street and all the
biggest names in 18th century French furniture and art work are nearby.
None of the stock will have been seen before in an international saleroom -
Burgi is the only important Paris dealer who visits private sellers and
salerooms in the provinces to find material. Aged 42, he began his career
with an eight-year stint in Paris's flea markets. He spent the next 17
selling two furniture dealers on the Faubourg Saint Honore and bought a
gallery on Rue Rossini, near the Drouot salerooms. He has another on Rue
Richer, in the north of Paris, and also sells from a chateau in the Yonne
region, near the capital.
In October, 1992, Burgi joined his former clients on the Faubourg on their
terms, furnishing his new headquarters at No 77 with some of the best pieces
he had collected over 20 years. He spent FFr3m (Pounds 350,000) renovating
the premises, believing that an energetic approach and modest profit margins
could poke the market into life.
However, the American and European clientele he acquired were rich but
penny-pinching. After 11 months of trading only one item a week, earning
one-third of what he needed to cover costs and losing a total of FFr8m
(nearly Pounds 1m), Burgi decided last month to throw in the towel.
The failure of such a big dealer could, ironically, prove very damaging to
his competitors by breaking prices. Last week, Paris's Tribunal de Commerce
gave the go-ahead necessary for Burgi, as a tradesman, to auction his stock,
which could raise anything between FFr11m and FFr33m (Pounds 1.2m to Pounds
3.5m). No estimates will be published: those used by experts cataloguing
Burgi's stock are based on their feeling for the market in its current
depressed state. They are often one-third of those which Burgi quotes in his
gallery, which are, in turn, considerably lower than the prices some of his
near neighbours ask for similar items.
'I decided that it was not sporting to use reserve prices. Everything must
go and a lot of people could make the bargains of their lifetimes. Prices
will only depend on the buyers and this sale will fix prices in the field of
18th century furniture for a long time to come. At last, we are going to see
what this stuff is really worth on the open market,' Burgi said.
The September sale will include a very rare pair of early 19th century
English benches in beautifully-moulded mahogany and red leather, a Louis XIV
Boulle bookcase and a pair of Louis XVI oak consoles painted in trompe
l'oeil marble, similar to a couple the Getty Museum bought in Paris for
FFr400,000 (Pounds 46,000) five years ago. Burgi is also selling a Japanese
screen in Coromondelle lacquer. It is the type stocked by most of his
colleagues on the Faubourg but could sell for a fraction of the normal
asking price of around FFr800,000 (about Pounds 96,000).

BROKEN LIVES: SEPARATION AND DIVORCE IN ENGLAND 1660-1857 by Lawrence Stone
Oxford Pounds 16.95, 355 pages
THIS IS the third of Lawrence Stone's volumes on marriage in early modern
England. A fascinating collection of case studies of marital discord among
the 17th and 18th century upper classes, it follows an analytical study and
a volume of case studies of the making of marriages in the period.
However, Broken Lives stands on its own, and might best be recommended not
as an accompaniment to Stone's earlier tomes but as a follow-up - moving
backwards, as it were - to Lady Chatterley for those who found their Sunday
sex insufficiently explicit or violent. Skip the scholarly introduction, and
get straight down to Chapter 1: Botler v. Botler, the battered wife.
One groom apart, in Broken Lives the servants know their place - which is
alternately to save their mistresses from being battered to death, to spy on
their illicit liaisons the better to extract silence money thereafter, and,
when the inevitable case for cruelty, adultery, annulment, separation,
alimony, or a variable combination of them, reached the ecclesiastical
courts (whose records are the main source for the study), to provide the
peep-hole and sheet-stain evidence critical to success or failure.
Divorce, of course, was not available until 1857 - the best one could hope
for was annulment on grounds of impotence, which again depended heavily on
the sheets.
A few chapters in, you become accustomed to the cultural idiosyncracies of
yesteryear, such as the total ignorance of the reproductive system and the
almost unfettered control of the men over property and children.
If the individuals portrayed here (admittedly they are an exceptional lot,
even of their own class in their own day) were not so unrelentingly selfish,
one could even sympathise with those trapped in a society that was starting
to tie sex to love yet still requiring its social leaders to treat their
marriages as business deals, and forbidding them from seeking satisfaction
elsewhere.
Yet the sheer violence continues to amaze. And this of the very rich to the
very rich.
Take Dineley v. Dineley. In 1717 Sir John Dineley, Bart., grandson of a
deputy-governor of Bombay whose son secured a baronetcy and a seat in
Parliament through marriage to a Worcestershire heiress, in turn married
Mary Lawford, the 14-year-old heiress to a Bristol merchant's fortune.
Neither was quite typical: he, a second son not expected to inherit, had
been sent to sea; she was almost illiterate, which was unusual for one of
her station by that time. But in marriage he acted to form, and was
sufficiently pukka to be made a local JP.
A man of violent disposition, Sir John was frequently given to kicking Mary
out of bed at night and locking her out of the house. When Mary quarrelled
with his mistress, he chained her to a post in the garret. She, in turn,
grew familiar with Sir Robert Jason, a neighbour, and took to the bottle.
The crunch came when Sir John feared that his wife, off to the races at
Chipping Campden, was about to elope with Sir Robert. Again beaten and
chained to a post in the garret - and only released, black and blue, when
the local gossip became intolerable - Mary sued for separation with alimony
on grounds of cruelty. The case ran for nine years, consumed much of their
combined fortune, but ended up with Mary in prison and in penury.
Meanwhile, Sir John engaged in a bitter quarrel with his equally violent
younger brother Samuel, heir to the Dineley estates under their father's
will.
Depriving Samuel of his reversion became his life's passion. By a
complicated ruse, requiring the consent of his (now adult) son whom he had
deserted to abject poverty and near death in London, Sir John succeeded in
doing so.
Samuel's revenge was to hire some ruffians, abduct Sir John from the streets
of Bristol in broad daylight, bundle him into a barge, get the ruffians
drunk, and then set them to throttle his brother in his presence - the
murder taking about half an hour. Discovered, Samuel was hanged before an
enormous crowd, after praying: 'Lord do not reward me according to my
desserts.'
By the end of the book, the notion of just desserts seems far-fetched. Then
is the time to turn to the introduction, where Stone makes excellent sense
of it all.

THE IMPRESSIONIST AND THE CITY: PISSARRO'S SERIES PAINTINGS by Richard R
Brettell and Joachim Pissarro Yale Pounds 35/Pounds 18.95, 230 pages
THE COLLECTED WRITINGS OF ROBERTMOTHERWELL edited by Stephanie Terenzio
Oxford Pounds 35, 325 pages
MARCEL DUCHAMP by Jacques Caumont and Jennifer Gough-Cooper Thames &amp; Hudson
Pounds 45, 520 pages
VISITORS TO the Pissarro exhibition at the Royal Academy in London until
October 10 will find their interest in it strengthened by perusal of Richard
R. Brettell and Joachim Pissarro's The Impressionist and the City:
Pissarro's Series Paintings. Among other things the volume informs us which
paintings were shown in Dallas (where the show opened last year) but not in
London and vice versa. Since the artist died the components of each series
have been dispersed over many collections.
When he painted his views of Paris, Rouen, Le Havre and Dieppe, Pissarro's
intention was to show the motifs in each city under a variety of different
circumstances and effects of light. Joachim Pissarro discusses how the
notion of making a series of paintings of a city developed within the
Impressionist movement - 'the multiplication of representations of a given
site as its aspects change'. This was enthusiastically taken up by Pissarro,
who produced these pictures in a burst of creativity in his 60s and early
70s. Before this Pissarro had been exclusively a painter of rural life.
In Pissarro's friend Monet's paintings of city life everything within the
frame of the painting merges into a unified whole. In his own there is great
differentiation; individual figures of horse-driven carriages and
pedestrians stand out. The effect is one of crowded, vital humanity within
the urban environment. In politics Pissarro was a radical. These paintings
also reflect his sympathy with anarchism.
Pissarro was born in the Virgin Islands, the son of a French businessman. He
angered his parents, who were orthodox Jews, by having an affair with their
gentile maidservant, whom he married. She bore him six children.
Pissarro and his fellow-Impressionists tried to depict in paint exactly what
they saw in the external world. When the American artist Robert Motherwell
was a student of philosophy he was greatly influenced by French attitudes to
art. That was in the 1940s, when innovative artists in America had turned
away from external reality to a 'super-reality' to be found by plumbing the
depths of consciousness; hence that unsatisfactory term, surrealism.
The Collected Writings of Robert Motherwell, edited by Stephanie Terenzio,
reveals how indebted the New York School of painting was to surrealism.
Rothko, Kline, De Kooning, Ad Reinhardt: none would have painted the way
they did had it not been for French surrealism. They became labelled
Abstract Expressionists (a term Motherwell disliked). Piet Mondrian and
Marcel Duchamp were living and working in America during the second world
war, as were many other foreign artists. It was from contact with Sebastian
Matta, the Chilean-born surrealist painter, that Motherwell's own gift for
surreal painting was released.
Because of his philosophical training, his gift for articulating the basic
principles of the movement, Motherwell was frequently invited to lecture
about these revolutionary American painters. All his lectures and published
writings have now been put together. Though there is a certain amount of
repetition, the collection is well edited and it will become essential for
an understanding of Abstract Expressionism.
Motherwell's trademark was his distinctive use of black as a colour,
particularly in his 'Elegy to the Spanish Republic' paintings, where there
are usually two smudgy black oval shapes to be seen in the foreground.
Bull-fighting is hinted at here: these ovoids are designed to remind us of
the testes of a bull. If you think they are not unlike the shapes anyone
might make while doodling, you would be right. Doodling, or
free-association, is serious activity in this kind of work.
Here is Motherwell's description of his own method of work: 'I usually begin
a picture with a 'doodle', or with a liquid puddle like a Rorsach image (but
not pressed together), or with a line or a dot, or a piece of paper dropped
at random on what will be a collage. Then the struggle begins, and endures
throughout in a state of anxiety that is ineffable, but obliquely recorded
in the inner tensions of the finished canvas'.
This account of an approach that relies on the random, the aleatory, is
reminiscent of the method of Marcel Duchamp, who progressed from an early
form of cubism via surrealism to styles involving 'ready-made' objects like
bicycle wheels seen in isolation, styles peculiarly his own. His development
is plotted in the Duchamp exhibition at the Palazzo Grassi in Venice, open
throughout July.
This massive volume on Duchamp, edited by Pontus Hulten with texts by
Jacques Caumont and Jennifer Gough-Cooper, is at one end a superbly
illustrated catalogue of the exhibition; at the other an account of events
in the artist's life organised under astrological signs. Happenings widely
separated in time - say, 1928, 1946, 1950 - are entered one after the other
because they occurred under the same zodiacal sign. It is a dotty approach
to chronology but one that, I feel, Duchamp would have appreciated: it makes
interesting reading for his admirers because much of the material has not
been published before.

FT  10 JUL 93 / Property: Self-build - the way to save money / A look at the
sector that has become the biggest player of all
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID HOPPITT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER many false dawns, the green shoots of real recovery are at last
sprouting from the compost heap of Britain's house-building industry.
Fairbriar Homes has shown the door to the administrators, proving there is
life after near-death, while David Goldstone has seen off the vultures that
were hovering above struggling Regalian. And a development of 38 detached
houses called Windmills around the tower mill at Shirley, Surrey, has proved
so popular that Cala Homes (South) has had to advance its building programme
from two years to one.
Throughout the seemingly endless recession in the building industry, though,
one sector has emerged as the biggest player. Self-builders now account for
at least 15,000 new homes each year, and the number is growing all the time.
Most self-builders do not mix the mortar and lay the bricks themselves.
Christopher Heath, of Redhill-based Custom Homes, says: 'Some of our
customers hand over to a site agent who organises sub-contractors; a
contractor of this kind is responsible for the inter-mixing of the various
trades. Even greater savings can be made if they organise the
sub-contractors themselves.
'We recommend timber frame construction, not only because of its high energy
efficiency but because most companies will quote for supply and erection to
a stage that is ready for roof tiling, so tradesmen can very quickly move in
to get on with their work.'
There is a growing awareness of the advantages of self-building. The savings
can be huge: 40 per cent or even more for those who roll up their sleeves
and help with the actual building. And they get the house that they want,
where they want it, rather than the one the builder thinks they ought to
have.
The curious thing is the time self-build has taken to catch on. In most
countries, a high proportion of home-owners choose both the location and the
design of their home; only in Japan are people less inclined than the
British to take a major part in building the family home.
Jeremy Fermo and his wife, Shirley, who retired to Sydney, Australia, a few
years ago, yearned for 'something beamy' in Hampshire when they came back.
After a long search, they bought a plot and built one of Potton's Tudor
look-alikes, with plenty of beams but no head-banging - Tudor without tears.
The beautiful home, with 2,500 sq ft of floor area, cost them only Pounds 44
a sq ft to build.
Katie Fontana and her friend, Tony Niblock, saved even more money by doing
much of the work on their Suffolk long-house. As a result, this 2,100 sq ft
home cost them only Pounds 35 a sq ft to erect. 'I scoured the Suffolk
countryside studying architectural features and looking for old bricks and
tiles,' says Fontana. 'Tony did the plans and we lived in a caravan on the
site while we built the house. We were a bit cold in the winter but there
was only one tantrum.'
Potton has now provided budding self-builders with their own Mecca - three
magnificent show houses at St Neots, in Cambridgeshire, close to the Al. Two
are in the well-established Potton Tudor style, with inglenooks and beams,
while the third, a 3,000 sq ft Georgian-style house, is called The
Milchester.
Kits for these houses cost between Pounds 25,400 and Pounds 47,600; to
build, with all the fittings seen at the show houses, will set you back
between Pounds 70,000-Pounds 120,000. All you need is the land on which to
place them.

FT  10 JUL 93 / Property: The Frasers move out - After 600 years, a Scottish
idyll is on the market / Cadogan's Place
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
IMAGINE a 60-acre island in the middle of a Scottish river. It is covered
with mixed trees, rhododendrons and azaleas. The air is so pure that lichen
abounds, even on the garden furniture.
The cliff at one end is the Point, where the trees and rocks opposite
shimmer in the calm water. Three-quarters of a mile away at the other end is
the Counterpoint, where water meadows make the view. Between are paths and
clearings and views of the river and a gorge and otters, roe deer, pine
martens, red squirrels, herons and buzzards.
A balustraded bridge over the Beauly river leads to this island fiefdom of
Eilean Aigas in Inverness-shire. It is the ideal place for a holiday or
honeymoon or to settle to write (as did Compton Mackenzie, Maurice Baring
and Antonia Fraser) and garden in rare peace, 11 miles from Inverness and 25
from its airport.
After 600 years in the Fraser family it is now for sale, complete with the
laird's house of 1838 built by the then Lord Lovat, head of the Fraser clan,
for the two extraordinary brothers who called themselves Sobieski Stuart.
They claimed to be grandsons and heirs of Bonnie Prince Charlie and,
remarkably, society in London and Scotland accepted them. They learnt Gaelic
and chronicled the dress and customs of the Highlands in their book The
Costume of the Clans, an invaluable work since the old tartans were being
forgotten after the British government proscribed Highland dress from 1748
to 1788.
At Eilean Aigas, they made themselves a set of out-size baronial wooden
chairs (still in the house) and a rich Scottish interior - antlers galore -
for their 'court.' John, the elder brother, painted a picture of the two of
them,standing in the book room in front of the fireplace where the picture
hangs now. They went to church by boat, in full Highland rig with a piper
playing. They are buried in Eskdale churchyard, along with various Frasers
and Maurice Baring.
Benjie Fraser is selling Eilean Aigas, having inherited it from his father,
Sir Hugh Fraser, the MP who died in 1984. The house is in good condition and
can sleep 19. There is enough hot water for all and Sir Hugh installed a
heated swimming pool, too.
The property has been available for renting by the week, for Pounds 1,975
plus VAT. That is cheaper than a hotel for a houseful and there is a choice
of looking after yourself, bringing your own help, or using the existing
help in the house.
Savills (031-2266961) is looking for offers over Pounds 800,000. The buyer
of this island romance will want to bid also for the book, chairs and
picture of the Sobieski Stuarts.

THE WINDS of change still blow in South Africa. Hamptons International
(071-493-8222) teamed up recently with Seeff International Properties of
South Africa, where property is remarkably good value. Now, it has announced
its first South African house for sale: Withycomb, a 1909 Cape Dutch
homestead in Constantia, 18 km from Cape Town, with a guest cottage and two
acres. Price: R1.3m (about Pounds 265,000).

FT  10 JUL 93 / Motoring: A coupe in disguise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOW DOES one describe the five-door Subaru Impreza? It is about the size of
a Ford Escort and looks like a cross between a saloon and an estate. But it
is really a hardtop coupe with no centre pillar (B-post, in motor
industry-speak) and a load-carrying bustle behind.
Press the power window switches and the glass disappears into the frameless
doors. At least, it does into the front ones, but the hardtop coupe effect
is spoiled by rear side windows that retract only partly because the wheel
arch gets in the way.
Go round to the back and lift the curvy tailgate. The fair-sized boot turns
into an estate's load space when the rear seat backrests fold forward. As
the cushion does not swing up, the floor is not flat. Uniquely for
road-going 4 x 4s, Subarus come with either five-speed manual or four-speed
automatic transmission. Those with manual gears have a two-range box giving
10 speeds forward and two in reverse.
Who needs twin-range, four-wheel drive in a road car? If you have tried
re-starting on a steep, wet hill when towing a horse trailer, you will not
need to ask. The same goes if you live off the beaten track in an area where
snow falls most winters. You will know the safest way to drive down a really
slippery slope is to put a 4 x 4 vehicle in low-range first gear and forget
about the brakes.
In normal motoring, my test 1.8-litre manual Impreza went well. It hummed
quietly along motorways at a business driver's speeds, rode firmly and flat
on country lanes, and parked easily - power steering is standard. So, too,
are electric windows and mirrors and other useful things like headlamps with
washers and a power-operated levelling system, a tilt steering wheel, and
adjustable driver's seat.
Now that the cheapest Audi quattro - admittedly, a 2.8-litre V6 - is listed
at Pounds 22,560, the Impreza looks remarkably affordable. An entry model,
1.6-litre, dual-range, manual five-door is Pounds 12,499, a 1.8-litre Pounds
12,999, and a 1.8-litre automatic (which does not have dual-range
transmission) Pounds 13,999.
If you want the flat-four engines and all-wheel drive, but not the odd
estate-cum-hardtop styling, there are 1.8-litre Impreza four-door saloons at
Pounds 12,499 (manual) and Pounds 13,499 (automatic).
Average fuel consumption of the Imprezas should be around 31-33 mpg (9.1-8.5
l/100km) for the 1.6-litre and 1.8-litre manuals, 30 mpg (9.4 l/100km) for
the automatics. I have promised myself another go at one in conditions when
having all-wheel drive could make all the difference between completing a
journey and getting stuck.

FT  10 JUL 93 / Sport: Why Formula One is running on empty - Motor Racing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN JACQUES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EVERY big sporting event needs a little hype, preferably with a domestic
angle. For tomorrow's British Grand Prix at Silverstone the angle is: can
Damon Hill edge out his team-mate Alain Prost and win. But I fear it is all
a sham. Hill may win, but his victory will have more in common with
professional wrestling, or an arranged marriage, than high noon on the race
track. If he wins, it will be because Prost lets him and the Williams team
deem it good public relations at their home grand prix.
Hill has done well. With almost no grand prix experience, and little
evidence in his career to suggest that he was a high-flier, he has performed
as a competent number two driver should. But no-one should be deceived by
the hype into thinking Hill is Nigel Mansell. In anything other than the
Williams, a car without peers in Formula One, Hill would look like what he
is, a competent midfield runner. But for the F1 authorities, the hype is
important. Something is needed to inject life into a tedious season.
One-team domination is by no means unusual in F1. If anything, it tends to
be the rule. In 1986 and 1987 it was Williams-Honda. In 1988 and 1989, it
was McLaren-Honda. In 1992 and 1993 it has been Williams-Renault. But for
the most part the dominant team has fielded two topline drivers who have
slugged it out on the race tracks: first Mansell and Nelson Piquet, then
Ayrton Senna and Prost. Riccardo Patrese, Mansell's team-mate in 1991 and
1992, was not in the same league as the Englishman, but he was a serious
competitor, at least in 1991. Hill is not. The result has been boredom.
The decision of Mansell, the most popular driver in F1 and one of its two
most charismatic performers, to join the Indycar series has left a hole.
Only three virtuoso races by Senna, the other charismatic driver, has kept
the season and the formula alive.
The most dramatic feature of tomorrow's race could be the size of the crowd.
Ever since Mansell won his first grand prix on British soil at Brands Hatch
in 1985, there has been a love affair between the crowd and the driver. They
came in their tens of thousands and Mansell rewarded them with some great
drives. But Mansell has gone and the race is bound to prove an emotional
anti-climax. The organisers expect the attendance to be down by 20 per cent.
That, I suspect, is a serious underestimate. There is no Mansell. We are
halfway through a numbingly boring season. And the crowds have been well
down at the previous European rounds, in at least three cases by as much as
half. F1 is in crisis. This was already evident last season. There were
rumours that television, the key to the success of F1, was unhappy with the
spectacle. Viewing figures were falling. Mansell's flight has brought the
matter to a head.
The rumblings of discontent have found a focus, there is an alternative by
which F1 can be measured. It has been found wanting. In Indycar, the key is
entertainment The technical regulations are designed to equalise the
performance of the cars and place the emphasis on driver ability. If racing
gets a bit processional, then the pace car can always balance things.
The highlight of the motor racing season has been this year's Indianapolis
500: no grand prix could compare with the excitement and openness of the
occasion. But that is not all. In Indycar there are parade laps before the
race when the drivers are introduced to the spectators. The public is free
to mingle with the drivers in the paddock. Admission prices are reasonable:
a full-day's entertainment at Indianapolis costs a mere Dollars 20 (Pounds
13).
The centre of interest has begun to shift. Every Indycar race is receiving
serious coverage in the UK. When the Canadian Grand Prix was held within a
few hours of the Milwaukee Indy race last month, the two received almost
equal treatment. The viewing figures for Independent Television's Indycar
coverage are not far behind those for the BBC's grand prix programmes.
Brands Hatch is negotiating to bring Indycar to Europe for the first time in
September 1994. If it is successful, and Mansell is still in Indycar, the
crowd will dwarf that at the British Grand Prix next July.
Fisa, motor racing's governing body, is fighting back. It knows F1 is in
crisis and that something must be done. It wants to ban the latest gizmos,
such as active suspension, semi-automatic transmission and traction control,
which have been the main source of Williams' domination and which it sees as
limiting the role of the driver. This is a volte face in the philosophy of
F1. Hitherto it has prided itself on being technologically-driven. Those
days are over. The emphasis in future will be on entertainment. The leading
teams, Williams and McLaren, are resisting, but they will lose. Too much is
at stake.
But if F1 is to prosper, these changes can only be a beginning. The motor
racing authorities, in which Bernie Ecclestone, now vice-president of Fisa,
is the key figure, presided over enormous growth in the popularity of grand
prix racing in the 1970s and 1980s. But it was a sport packaged for
television. The spectator was largely ignored. Now television companies are
having second thoughts and the spectators are staying away.
Grand prix racing is paying the price for ignoring the public. Silverstone
this weekend will say it all. The racing will, in all probability, be
tedious and boring. The general admission price, at Pounds 57, is
ridiculous. And the paddock will resemble Fort Knox: the F1 elite and the
public are never destined to mix. There has been a welcome decision to hold
a parade lap. Indycar is exerting an influence.
F1 has been slow to recognise the warning signs. Like many sports it remains
desperately introverted. Conflicting interests divide it. The top teams
cannot see beyond their own advantage. The sport is ill-served by most
journalists who lack a wider sense of motor racing's place in the world. At
last, however, Fisa seems to have woken to the dangers. Banning gizmos is
the first step. The interests of spectator and viewer must become paramount.
In the meantime, the return of Mansell in 1994 would help.

FT  10 JUL 93 / Sport: Captains of contrast - Golf
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOCK HOWARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SINCE 1983, when Europe lost the Ryder Cup to the US by a single point in
Florida, there has never been more than a blade of grass between the two
sides. What Europe have lacked in depth they have made up for in spirit and
astute captaincy.
Tony Jacklin, who captained the side from 1983 to 1989, was responsible for
much of this resurgence. He realised that if things were to change on the
course, things off it had to change too.
'Before I took the job,' says Jacklin, 'I demanded that certain conditions
were met. You wouldn't believe how far behind the Americans we were in terms
of preparation. I made sure the little things were right, as only then could
we hope to compete on equal terms.'
Jacklin's part in the European success in the 1980s, should not be
underestimated. He led by reputation, and was hugely respected. He also
introduced a fiery competitiveness which rubbed off on his team.
'I still love beating the Americans more than anything else in the world,'
he says with boyish enthusiasm. 'There is something about their
over-confidence which gets me going.'
The man who succeeded Jacklin, Bernard Gallacher, is a different animal.
They are as different as a birdie is from a bogey, one an Englishman living
in Scotland; the other, a Scotsman living in England.
Gallacher never won a major championship. Jacklin won two. Gallacher has
still never tasted success in the Ryder Cup. Jacklin has. Gallacher has six
or seven players in his team who are better golfers than he ever was.
Jacklin probably only ever had one (Seve Ballesteros).
A large part of the captain's work is dealing with the press. Gallacher
admits that he does not enjoy this side of his job, and is deeply suspicious
of the media. Jacklin loves dealing with journalists, and they love him,
because he says what he thinks, and what he thinks is usually quotable.
'I think there is a case for not having a captain as we have one today,'
says Jacklin. 'It might be more appropriate to have a manager, much as they
do in cricket, who would be entirely press-related. The captain would play,
and deal with what happens on the course.'
The job of captain is certainly less important now that Gallacher is the
incumbent. He is shy and introverted, a private, family man. He does not
seem, on the outside anyway, to be a great motivator. By his own admission,
he took a considerable time before deciding that he wanted to take the job.
Gallacher said in February that he would be happy to have a rule which made
him pick the top 12 on the money list, as he found selecting three wild card
players an awkward task. Jacklin says he would have liked, when captain, to
have had all 12 picks himself, so confident was he of picking the right
players.
Gallacher was not to blame for events at Kiawah Island two years ago. He was
not to know that Nick Faldo and Ian Woosnam would play well below - rather
than under - par.
Gallacher must assert himself more than he did two years ago. Then,
controversy seemed to follow him at every turn. His defence was to run from
the spotlight. He became moody and monosyllabic, in contrast to the
ever-approachable Dave Stockton. As a result, people suggested that Seve was
more in charge of the European team than Gallacher was.
Seve may not even make the team this time, but whether he does or not,
Gallacher must be more convincing if Europe are to recapture the Cup at the
Belfry in September.

FT  10 JUL 93 / Sport: Revenge of the Vitamins - Cricket
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERESA MCLEAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT WAS my fault. I had been to my local greengrocer's shop every day of the
week before the Intellectuals' annual match. Mark, the greengrocer, was our
secret weapon. Many the hour we had spent solving Gooch's problems and
planning the Intellectuals' triumph, while I bought my bananas. The trouble
was, I forgot to remind him that he was Intellectual batsman-and-
bowler-in-chief and he forgot.
The rest of us arrived at the ground for a picnic lunch in the sunshine. Our
heroic long-distance contingent did its customary drive across the country,
from the Welsh border to East Anglia, driven by Charles, his car frothing
with children.
Will, an umpire who passed from the playful to the judicial role when his
hip joints locked up a few years ago, practised his walking by getting off
the train 30 miles away and completing his journey on foot. Even so, he
looked well. Both umpires looked well, Will in his shorts, with an air of
amiability, Diana in her yellow trousers and pink T-shirt, with an air of
majesty.
Our problem was the opposition, the Vitamins. Their air was one of
determination. Sunshine and noble umpires shone in the shadow of Vitamin
ambition. They had lost last year and they must win this year.
With characteristic stoicism, we watched an ample enemy batsman make an
ample half-century before retiring, to our forlorn applause. Much though I
dislike the ruthless professionalism of modern cricket, I felt a twinge of
deeper dislike for the cavalier kindness I thought I loved. It is so
humiliating. Anyone who has been the victim of an opponent's retirement will
understand the misery that accompanies the relief. With the Vitamins at 116
for 0 after 16 overs, I knew that the Intellectuals played for love of the
game, not victory.
Everyone in our team bowled three overs, except a lawyer, Martyn, who donned
the gloves without complaint when we found we had no-one else.
Only one word describes our bowling throughout this match: unpredictable.
Our young West Indian opening bowler sent down some good deliveries,
including plenty that troubled the keeper, but few that troubled the
batsmen. Our New Zealand new recruit from the heights of cricket literature,
Graeme, assumed greengrocer Mark's position as top performer. His fast
medium pace nearly, so nearly, gave us the early break-through we needed.
What Graeme gave us instead of wickets was style. He arrived in an open car
with his girlfriend, who reclined gracefully while we toiled through the
agreed 30 overs, limiting the opposition to 223 for 4. My off-breaks were
grotesque, adorned only by their originality. My husband's leg-breaks,
formal in approach, modest in pace, saved our bowling honour by hitting the
stumps. But only once.
It was a dead pitch, no good for bowlers. No good for our bowlers, anyway.
More disconcertingly, it appeared to be a dead captain in command of the
Vitamins. He had an off-white face, presumably plastered with white
grease-paint, which gazed at us from underneath an overhanging hat. His pale
limbs were aired in a flapping shirt and long-legged shorts. He found
running a struggle, wheezing and staggering, not sharing his team's grim
preference for boundaries.
Tea is an under-rated meal. I am the first to pass it off with a quick
cupful, but oppressed by our target of more than seven an over and our
modest ability, I sank happily into an iced bottleful. Not, I hasten to add,
that the wine was the reason I batted badly. It was because I was born a
tonker.
After a deep-rooted tea, with defeat impending and grinning Vitamins
clustered round the bat, I could not resist a swipe, which let the ball
remove the bails. As our meteorologist opening batsmen said when his wife
asked whether he had seen the ball that bowled him for a duck: 'I heard it.'
Haunted by those woody rattles, we decided to run for everything we could
while we could.
Undaunted by his efforts in the car and in the field, Charles batted
powerfully. He hit the ball over the heads of fielders and ran fast. His
run-out was tragic because he was hitting the ball well, even when it was
delivered disdainfully slowly.
The run-out had an element of the operatic about it, involving a mid-run
re-arrangement between the batsmen and conference between bowler, keeper and
stray fielders. Charles expired like a doom-laden hero. My husband's run-out
was more wistful, as he attempted a possible but not probable run disliked
by Graeme at the other end. Graeme kept his running safe, his bat straight
and his style intact. He top scored for the Intellectuals and his dismissal
had an exotic, almost a continental flavour: caught and bowled De Luca 34.
A little further down the order, Godfrey left the university manuscripts and
supported the intellectual life with his bat. Brave, quiet and dignified, he
delighted his disheartened team, huddled on the pavilion steps, with the
correctness of his shots. Between shots, he leaned lightly on his bat.
Umpire Diana stood serene and still, above daft appeals for things like
obstructing the light. A regal presence. When Godfrey was finally bowled for
27, there was only the divine to talk to the regal. Our Dominican friar,
David, ran out of partners. Or rather, left them behind. He preferred big
hitting to running, smiting even the immense Vitamin bowler unused to
punishment. With God on his side, David finished the game not out on a
defeated team and joined us for dinner, to plot next year's ploys. In the
dark of night we sank to the most demonic of all ploys: practice.

FT  10 JUL 93 / Motoring: Be a VIP for just Pounds 15
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
NEXT YEAR'S British international motor show will be held once again at the
National Exhibition Centre near Birmingham. Public days will be October
22-30, which will catch the half-term school holidays. This is crucial if
there is to be a good attendance at what is being promoted as a family
occasion. If you are prepared to pay Pounds 15 to enter instead of the
normal Pounds 8, you will be able to call yourself a VIP and go to the
preview day on October 21.
The last show, in October 1992, broke a tradition of nearly 80 years by
linking itself with the Daily Mail Midlands autumn ideal home exhibition;
one ticket bought admission to both events. While the combination was not
entirely popular, it will be tried again in 1994; the Mail's Pounds 2.5m
contribution must be a powerful argument.
Despite its imposing title and great size, the show is really a regional
event; most of the public attendance comes from the Midlands. But London -
which is where many, if not most, of the car-makers and importers would like
the international exhibition to be held - will have its own motor show from
October 21-31 this year at Earl's Court. It will not be run in tandem with
any other event but, even more than Birmingham, is pitched at the whole
motoring family.
The London motor show, held in the years when there is no international
exhibition at Birmingham, started life in the 1980s as Motorfair. At first,
there was opposition from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders,
which has always operated the 'official' show. But it refused to be killed
off and, in recent years, has been run jointly by the SMMT and Earl's Court.
Next year, the international show will pay the former Motorfair - which has
always encouraged retail sales - a compliment. For the first time, the SMMT
will use the National Exhibition Centre Pavilion to stage what is being
billed as 'the largest motoring retail shop in the world.' New or used cars
will not be on sale - but just about everything else concerned with motoring
will.

FT  10 JUL 93 / Travel: An aircraft of one's own - Chartering aircraft for a
cross-Channel jaunt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM VIDAL

<TEXT>
'LET'S GO to Paris for lunch.' That is what my wife said to me at 7.30 on a
sunny Sunday morning, writes William Vidal.
It sounded like a throwback to the roaring 1980s. Perhaps she thought she
was cheering me up. If so, it worked.
I called British Airways: Pounds 182 a head was the cheapest day return
fare. Add to this Pounds 6 for 12 hours' parking at Gatwick and around
Pounds 10 for petrol (we live in east Kent) and you get Pounds 380 for two,
not counting the taxi from the airport to central Paris.
Then consider the time factor. Leave home by 8:30 am, arrive Gatwick 9:45,
park car (short-term car park), check-in by 10 for the 10:25 flight (no
luggage).
Arrive Charles de Gaulle 12:40 local time. Quick taxi to Boulevard St
Germain (fairly fast on a Sunday) and, with luck, we might have napkins
round our necks by 1:30 pm.
Then I had a brainstorm.
I called my local little airport and, yes, they would happily provide an
aircraft and pilot for the day, a six-seater Piper Seneca (five passengers)
at Pounds 759 or a 10-seater (nine passengers) Piper Chieftain at Pounds 972
all in.
I called some friends, just as crazy as us.
'Want to go to Paris for lunch?' 'When?' 'Now.' 'How are we getting there?'
'I chartered a plane.' 'What?'
By 9 am the four of us were at Lydd airport, eight miles away. By 9.15 we
were taking off, having left our car in the free car park and brandished our
credit cards.
We climbed over the Channel and settled at 8,000 ft, taking in the beauty of
the French countryside while our charming captain, Caroline - holder of an
ATPL, the highest form of pilot's licence there is  - pointed out the
landmarks revealed to us with a clarity unavailable from 30,000 ft to those
travelling in airline jets.
Seventy minutes later we were on the ground at Le Bourget, the old Paris
airport (even older than Orly) now dedicated almost entirely to private
aircraft. Thirty minutes later (customs and immigration were virtually
non-existent), we were sipping aperitifs, having first dropped in at Chez
Monique and booked a table for 1 pm.
We had beaten the jets by one hour and saved Pounds 1 on the travelling cost
(not counting the airport taxi, which was considerably cheaper from Le
Bourget). And we had the luxury of an empty seat.
Our charter cost of Pounds 189.75 each would have been reduced to Pounds 152
a head had we been able to enlist a fifth luncheon partner.
Furthermore, the aircraft was ours for the day, allowing us ample time for a
magnificent Sunday lunch followed by a short cab ride and an afternoon
stroll in the Bois de Boulogne. Had we had nine similarly-minded people
available, the outing would have been even more attractive financially.
Taking the big Chieftain at Pounds 972 would have meant Pounds 108 a head,
or a saving of more than 40 per cent on BA's lowest fare.
Before you say that we are lucky to live eight miles from an airport, let me
suggest you do some local research: the Air BP Guide to flying clubs lists
218 organisations in the UK, from Jersey to Inverness, from which an
aircraft might be hired.
On the figures we were quoted, the Chieftain worked out at Pounds 6 a mile
for nine people (65p each) and the Seneca at just under Pounds 5 for five
(95p each). That would take five people from Southampton to Deauville and
back for Pounds 127 each, or nine people from Manchester to Dublin return
for Pounds 100 each.
Moreover, all the above trips have one factor in common: they involve a
flight over water, and Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) regulations require
that commercial flights  - those carrying fare-paying passengers  - should
be carried out by multi-engined aircraft.
If, however, you undertook a trip of the same duration but flew only over
land  - say, Birmingham to Brighton  - a single-engined aircraft could be
used and the cost per mile would be roughly halved. A six-seater Piper
Saratoga could probably do such a return journey at a total cost of Pounds
360, or Pounds 72 for each of five passengers.
We went to Paris for fun, but there is no reason why one could not apply the
same rationale to business trips. If you thought that chartering a private
aircraft was the exclusive domain of the very rich, think again. Air
charters can save money. They definitely save time; and if your ultimate
destination is other than a city with an international airport, then the
charter option wins hands down.
Since January, it has been possible to fly to EC destinations from any UK
airfield  - not just those with customs and immigration facilities - and
return the same way, as long as you give four hours' notice. The French are
not as relaxed yet but, almost invariably, they will arrange Customs
clearance for you at most destinations.
The next time the sun is shining and you feel the need to cheer yourself up,
pull out a map, pick a spot and telephone your local little airport.

FT  10 JUL 93 / Practical Traveller in Paris: Capital rooms that are cosy
but not costly - Bed and breakfast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICIA ROBERTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IMAGINE THIS: after a morning stroll through the streets of the Left Bank,
you turn down Rue de la Chaise and, pushing open a door set in a high wall,
step into the cobbled courtyard of a 17th-century hotel particulier, writes
Patricia Roberts. Birds chatter in the courtyard trees and sunlight hits a
tall window, illuminating a cozy room - your bedroom, with your own marble
bath.
Downstairs, breakfast is set on a Russian antique table and beckons with
steaming cafe creme and fresh croissants from the neighbourhood patisserie.
Your indulgence in butter and jam is carefree; after all, a swimming pool
awaits your penitent laps should the guilt prove too heavy.
Sounds like a five-star hotel? A private chateau? Mais non, this is bed and
breakfast Parisian-style. And for FFr354 (Pounds 44.25) a night for two, it
is what the French call rapport prix qualite - good value for money.
However, the real value of a B&amp;B (chez l'habitent in French) is the rare
glimpse it offers of la vie parisienne.
The moment you shake hands with your welcoming hosts, you go beyond being a
mere tourist. They not only share their homes with you, but will usually
part with wise advice worth its weight in gold: where to find the creamiest
chevre, most impressive St Emilion or flakiest pain au chocolat.
And with that first handshake passes an unspoken rule of respect for privacy
and property, on both sides. In all, the B&amp;B experience adds character to a
Paris visit that might otherwise be marked by an expensive hotel bill or the
number of monuments duly photographed.
'Napoleon's brother lived in this very house,' says Monsieur Wolfe, master
of the B&amp;B on Rue de la Chaise, as he gives me an armchair tour of the
neighbourhood 'Next door is the abbey and, further down, the former home of
Chateaubriand.' I dare not tell him how dangerous I think the neighbourhood
is now, with Yves St Laurent, Montana and Robert Merloz boutiques within
easy spending distance.
Like most French hosts, the Wolfes are gracious and warm, and no doubt
appreciate the extra income which helps towards maintaining their splendid
residence. Extra income, and perhaps the comfort of company, is what
prompted Madame Henri in the 17th arrondissement to turn part of her
exquisite top-floor apartment into a B&amp;B.
A striking woman celebrating her 81st birthday, Madame Henri guides me
through her home, pointing out photographs of faraway children and
grandchildren. She lectures on the high cost of living in Paris before
revealing three lovely guest rooms (one with a mini-bar), perfect for a
group of five. From the window I see the rotunda at Parc Monceau, and across
the street I spot Le Bistro du XVII where Parisians pack the tables for the
the low-priced, excellent four-course menu.
Not all guest rooms are as special as the one on Rue de la Chaise, or even
Madame Henri's, yet no matter how simply furnished, B&amp;Bs allow a unique
perspective on life in the very different corners of the city.
The best way to make reservations is to contact the France-based B&amp;B agents
directly. Rates are less expensive than if booking through international
travel companies and in most cases the local agencies have personally
inspected the properties and met host families. If you require hosts to
speak English, make this clear when booking.
Rooms are generally ranked in three categories: Category 1 is the lowest
priced, as residences are located out of the city centre and bath facilities
shared. Category 2 includes guestrooms in the most sought-after
arrondissements (4th, 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th and 15th), and have private baths.
Category 3 is reserved for addresses with extra charm or amenities: view,
exceptional interiors, superb locations.
The majority of rooms are furnished with two twin beds. For double beds,
request a grand lit. Ask if bathroom facilities are shared or private.
Breakfast usually means coffee or tea, tartine (fresh baguette spread with
butter or jam) or croissants. Juice sometimes. Meals may be provided in some
instances for a modest cost: ask when booking. Mini-bars are rare so ask if
water and snacks can be kept in the room or kitchen, or purchased from your
host.
With its signature coffee-pot spouting a heart, Cafe-Couette has been
welcoming travellers to its chambres d'amis lodgings for 10 years. The
organisation is well-equipped to handle reservations worldwide and
represents 70 residences in Paris, including the Wolfe residence. Rooms cost
from FFr267 to FFr481 for two. Cafe-Couette publishes a directory of
addresses (FFr69 at French bookstores, or from the agency) which, when
purchased, makes you a member of Club Cafe-Couette, entitling you to 20 per
cent off room rates. Two-day minimum stay. Credit cards accepted.
Cafe-Couette: 8, rue de I'Isly, 75008 Paris, tel: 42 94 92 00; fax: 42 94 93
12.
Bed and Breakfast 1 Connexion offers rooms ranging from FFr260 to FFr550 for
doubles. Lowest priced rooms are located in the Paris suburbs, not more than
30 minutes away. FFr50 additional fee for private baths. Discounts of 30-50
per cent for stays over one month. Credit cards, international money orders,
Eurochecks. Bed and Breakfast 1 Connexion: 7 rue de Campagne Premiere, 75014
Paris, tel: 43 35 11 26; fax: 40 47 69 20.
France-Lodge has more than 300 B&amp;Bs in Paris and requires no minimum stay.
Double rooms in the centre of Paris cost FFr250 to FFr350. A mandatory
membership fee of FFr85 entitles guests to on-site insurance. Meals
available at some addresses. French francs, international money orders or
bank transfers. Credit cards not accepted. France-Lodge: 5, rue du faubourg
Montmartre, 75009 Paris, tel: 48 01 02 17; fax: 42 46 65 61.
Chez Vous represents B&amp;B's throughout France, including Madame Henri's in
Paris. French francs, international money orders, no credit cards. Chez
Vous: 47150, Lacapelle Biron, France, tel: (33) 53 40 85 54; fax: (33) 53 40
86 30).
A point worth noting: B&amp;Bs are best suited for individuals, two friends or
couples. According to Corinne Bigot, owner of France-Lodge, families and
larger groups are better off renting furnished apartments. 'This is the most
inexpensive way for a group to stay in Paris,' she says. 'Besides, having a
kitchen is essential when traveling with children, especially in Paris.'
France-Lodge, Bed and Breakfast 1 Connexion and Chez Vous also rent
furnished apartments. Parissimo (9, avenue de la Motte Picquet, 75007 Paris,
tel: 45 51 11 11; fax: 45 55 55 81) is the place to go for apartments with
an extra special something - a terrace, a Seine view or outstanding decor.

FT  10 JUL 93 / Cookery: A source of good sauce
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIPPA DAVENPORT
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WHERE there is pasta, there is sauce
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
and the high street multiples are enjoying booming own-label sales on both
counts.
Last week, I reported on a blind tasting of supermarket pastas. This week,
the spotlight is on pasta sauces. Each company was invited to submit two -
whatever they considered to be their own-label best. My tasting panel was
the same as before: Anna Del Conte, Josceline Dimbleby, Simon Parkes, Oliver
Waley and Henry Dimbleby.
We started in a dubious mood as we all believe in the superiority of
home-made sauces. After all, making a pasta sauce takes only minutes and
calls for no special culinary skills. Indeed, many of the best can be
conjured up in the time it takes to boil the pasta.
The general quality of the sauces submitted for tasting was unappetising, to
say the least. A lot of unpleasant things were said. A sea of tomato and
other vegetable-based sauces elicited such comments as: 'This has the
reconstituted quality of packet soup', 'surely this is off?', 'disagreeably
thick and mushy; it smells of chlorine', 'a disaster', 'I cannot recall
tasting anything nastier'.
The so-called carbonaras provoked outrage because they were total misnomers
 -variations on a white sauce instead of eggy with snippets of fried bacon
and an optional splash of cream. 'Looks like bechamel and tastes like
cardboard boxes', 'where is the bacon? where is the egg?'
Only two sauces passed the test: 'Would you eat this again?'. The first was
a tomato and mascarpone sauce from Marks &amp; Spencer which just scraped by as
acceptable to some of the panel - sample comment 'there is something quite
nice about this' - although I recoiled from its chicken tikka-ish brown
colouring and frothy texture.
The other, also from Marks &amp; Spencer as it turned out, won rave notices all
round. We were amazed by it, a fresh tomato sauce that lived up to its name.
Pure and simple, it looked as good as it tasted. The tomatoes were of the
plum variety, top quality, full of flavour, very juicy, firm but not hard,
simply chopped, barely cooked in a little extra virgin olive oil, nicely
seasoned and scattered with basil. Josceline summed up our reactions neatly
when she exclaimed: 'I have never come across any sauce from any shop that
tasted as home-made as this.'
We thought it was a sauce with many potential applications. In fact,
arguably, as Anna commented, drained of some of its juice, it might be even
better for topping bruschetta than pasta. (Any juice drained off should be
saved for adding to soup or a salad dressing, or to drink with a slug of
vodka - it is far too good to sluice down the sink).
One thing that puzzled us was the label instruction to heat the sauce gently
and serve it hot. To do so risks robbing it of its lovely freshness. Far
better, we thought, to do as we did: put the sauce into a serving bowl, add
the cooked pasta and toss quickly to mix before serving. M &amp; S has since
amended the wording. The reasoning behind the original instructions
undoubtedly harks back to the British penchant for serving a little pasta
with our sauce, and the fear that the pasta would, thus overwhelmed, become
cold long before it hit the plate, let alone the palate.
It would be easy enough to make a sauce like this at home so far as culinary
skill is concerned and no-one could call it time consuming. But where would
you find sufficiently good tomatoes - the key ingredient? M &amp; S buy-in
special fruits specifically for making this sauce, variously from France,
Italy and Spain, wherever the best vine-ripened plum tomatoes are to be
found at any given time. If none are deemed good enough, this line is
suspended for the duration. Cooks wanting to make such a sauce at home would
probably have to grow their own tomatoes and will the sun to flavour them.
The sauce, as tasted at our sampling, is unhesitatingly to be recommended.
But a cautionary footnote must be added. I have found the product to be
variable (perhaps unavoidably?). A subsequent purchase had its subtlety and
tomatoeyness spoiled by the over-assertive presence of garlic and chilli.
Marks &amp; Spencer's fresh tomato sauce costs Pounds 3 per lb. The recommended
serving is 4-6 oz per person, which seems to me unnecessarily greedy. The
product is made fresh daily and goes on sale for one day only. Sadly it is
stocked only by branches that boast a deli counter - currently Marble Arch
and Kings Road Chelsea in London and Camberley in Surrey. More are in the
pipeline but not many.
Finding this sauce among so much dross made our hearts leap. Such quality
deserves to be encouraged. I would change my tune about buying sauces if
more were this good. How pleasing it would be if supermarkets developed all
their recipe products to match the best of home-made, as has been done in
this case.
Next week: home-made sauces

FT  10 JUL 93 / Food &amp; Drink: Cross-Channel wine buying - is it worth it? /
There may be more bargains in Tesco than in Calais
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANCIS ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government does have other things on its mind, but when will someone
draw its attention to the absurdities entailed by the relaxation of duty
free personal allowances?
There is something absurd about the current mass deployment of Customs and
Excise officers in undercover operations and dawn swoops, all to track down
lorry loads of French beer imported by duty evaders selling on what was
supposedly for their personal use. As each petty villain is expensively
brought to trial, another is surely risking his axle in some Calais car park
under the weight of booze, supposedly but, preposterously, for personal use.
Another absurdity is the current cross-Channel traffic in bottles and
people. British wine merchants who have had the enterprise and energy to
establish outposts in northern France (see below) have been despatching
wines back across the Channel so that they can be packed into a British boot
and trundled back across the waves for the third time as part of a duty free
personal wine allowance.
British wine (and beer) drinkers meanwhile are deliberately crossing the
water on booze-buying day trips. With Dover a new Malmo, isn't it time to
lower our duties to more European levels?
Almost certainly, but for the moment there are (a few) circumstances in
which it makes sense to import your own wine. Technically, the recommended
guideline for wine enthusiasts is a duty free allowance of 90 litres (or 10
cases of a dozen bottles) of still wine or 60 litres of sparkling wine -
although the controls on this at Channel ports are increasingly minimal.
A special provisioning trip across the Channel could be financially
justified only if there is a particularly large celebration in view. As it
happens, cheap champagne is one of the very few bargains to be had in French
supermarkets which have been retailing this serious rival to our own
elderflower cordial for under FFr50 (Pounds 5.82) a bottle this year. But it
is worth bearing in mind that cheap champagne is just that  - a thoroughly
reliable detonater of any ill feeling.
The other (drinkable) wines which represent good value if bought in the
better (ie larger) French supermarkets are basic red bordeaux - which, like
champagne, has loss leader status in France - and southern French reds.
Those carrying the name of a property usually, although not invariably,
taste less industrial than generic examples. It is generally possible to
find a serviceable petit chateau claret or a decent Corbieres for about
FFr12 (Pounds 1.39) a bottle.
The conventional British line on French supermarkets is that their wines are
unthinkably inferior to those on sale in Britain. It is perhaps unpatriotic
of me to suggest otherwise but this is an outdated view. They have improved
enormously over the last three years or so and many could offer British wine
enthusiasts some reasonably good buys in classed growth claret - until
sterling's fall from grace.
Today it makes sense to buy only the very cheapest wines in French
supermarkets, at a price level at which the nearly Pounds 1 a bottle UK
excise duty makes a real difference. But I have yet to find any cheap white
or pink wine in a French supermarket that seemed a good buy. The standard
price for very dull Muscadet, for example, is FFr19.95 or about Pounds 2.30,
which is no saving in terms of flavour per penny in comparison with, for
example, wines such as Tesco's zesty Australian White or the sumptuously
packaged Languedocien Domaine du Bois Chardonnay 1992 at Pounds 2.99 until
July 17.
There are many other ways of buying wine in France, however. You could buy
your own vines, through Wineshare on 0306-742164. The Cotes de Duras red,
white and rose which is made on your behalf works out at Pounds 2.50 per
bottle if collected in Boulogne.
Probably best value is to buy direct from a really fine producer if you
happen to be on holiday in the region anyway. The annual Guide Hachette des
Vins, FFr159 (Pounds 18.53) available in most French bookshops, is the
direct line to ratings of individual wines and telephone numbers. It also
includes a directory of cavistes, or specialist wine merchants, which are so
much rarer across the Channel.
Those travelling through St Malo should visit Le Tastevin in a backstreet
near the port for Christian Papin's quite sumptuous red Anjou-Villages 1990,
FFr35 (Pounds 4.07) and Graillot's Crozes-Hermitage 1990, FFr53 (Pounds
6.17).
But the British wine buyer will probably feel most at home at the
trans-Channel branches of British merchants. The Wine Society's near Le
Touquet is merely a members' collection point for cases of a restricted but
good quality range. The Grape Shop of Clapham's shop in Boulogne carries
several hundred different wines, more than 30 per cent of them from the New
World and other sources outside France. Although they are buying most French
wine direct, they find stocking difficult enough since the average customer
is British and buys six cases of wine at a time.
Richard Harvey, on the other hand, has been trying to rescue a high
proportion of his stock, imported from England, from the douaniers of
Cherbourg since his Maison du Vin opened on June 1.
This week The Grape Shop recommended as its best buy a Chablis 1991 at FFr39
(Pounds 4.54) - a minuscule saving indeed on Majestic's current parcel of
creditable Chablis 1991 at Pounds 4.99, and Tesco's slightly leaner example
reduced to Pounds 4.99.
The last time I scoured French wine shops, in May, I noted a Cahors that
looked promising at FFr49. A much better buy is Majestic's Cahors, Ch de
Quattre 1987 and, even better value, 1988 which they are selling for a
laughable Pounds 2.99, without even a suggestion of sea sickness.

FT  10 JUL 93 / Food &amp; Drink: Bring your own drink - Nicholas Lander finds
some inspiration from Australia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS LANDER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FASHION has always played a part in the restaurant business
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
who after all wants to be seen in the wrong restaurant? - but its role today
seems disproportionately large.
In recent years we have experimented with small bistros, Italian trattorias,
and haute cuisine. We have seen attempts to import the French brasserie and
enjoyed the vogue for British food cooked by British chefs. Today, we favour
big, noisy restaurants - which, acoustically, may have reached their nadir
at Quaglino's in London - serving gutsy Mediterranean food.
So where to next? This is a question being asked by many restaurateurs and
chefs, displaying that mixture of characteristics - part businessman, part
gambler - which they need to survive.
There is a shift towards Far Eastern cuisines and food which incorporates
Thai and Indian spices and techniques from Japan and China. The hotter, more
aggressive style of cooking that originates in South America, but is heavily
influenced by the Caribbean, is also in vogue and is the rage in the US
where the restaurants of Miami, close to Caribbean influences, are capturing
the culinary headlines.
But it is possible that the single most dramatic change to British
restaurants in the late 1990s may not come from any of these exotic places
but rather from an EC directive which came into force on January 1.
This had, for once, nothing to do with food preparation or hygiene but a
great deal to do with the way we buy one of a restaurant's staple
commodities - wine. The increase in personal allowances for British shoppers
travelling across the Channel has already seen several British wine
merchants set up shop along the northern French coast (see the article above
by Jancis Robinson).
Merchants are supplying not only those who want to stock up with a few cases
of house wine to store in the garage, but also those who are taking
advantage of potential savings to reduce the cost of holding a dinner or
party in their local UK restaurant. These customers are making their
bookings on the condition that they can bring their own wine: many
restaurants, unwilling to lose business in what are still difficult trading
conditions, are saying yes.
This phenomenon was explained to me by Ros Turner, managing director of
David Burns Fine Wines, near Southampton, in Hampshire. She has already lost
a number of private clients and is now seeing some of her restaurant trade
eroded. Those in the south of England may be the first to be affected
because of geography but this new shift in wine purchasing habits could
produce a wonderful opportunity for restaurants to reduce the cost of eating
out and win new customers if they are brave enough to embrace it.
For inspiration, British restaurateurs will have to look to Australia where
the concept of the BYO - bring your own - restaurant has flourished for
years. It exists because of ludicrous licensing laws but has resulted in
that happy combination of a restaurant being situated close to a 'bottle
shop'. You take your wine or buy it on the way, hand it over to a waiter to
open it, pay the corkage and concentrate on the menu. Everyone has profited.
The restaurants are busy, the domestic wine market has flourished and the
cost of eating out has remained relatively low. The system even produced
this bizarre statistic - at one stage 90 per cent of wine in Australia was
consumed within 30 minutes of purchase.
Restaurateurs would obviously be the first to complain at the disappearance
of a potential source of profit but the savings they would make - no stock,
no wine lists to be printed, no sommeliers to be trained and no bottles sent
back as 'corked' - could be substantial.
If they were to embrace this concept wholeheartedly and explain to the
public the reasons behind it, their net profits may not be seriously
impaired. Nothing in the restaurant business produces as large a profit as a
corkage charge. All the necessary equipment - glasses, corkscrews, decanters
 -has to be provided anyway and the costs involved, cleaning and polishing
glasses, are minimal.
Restaurateurs will complain that withdrawing their right to choose the wines
that they serve with their food may destroy a part of their raison d' etre.
But there would be no stopping any restaurateur offering his wine list
alongside the BYO facility or liaising with the nearest off-licence.
Consumers would appreciate the reasons behind the move and understand why
restaurateurs must charge sensible but fair corkage. I would suggest a
maximum of Pounds 5 per bottle of wine (Pounds 10 for champagne) while the
restaurant continues its normal policy on spirits and after-dinner drinks.
Fashion and the law may persuade restaurateurs that operating a BYO policy
is a new way of attracting extra customers and making eating out less
expensive.
Restaurants which already offer a BYO service in London are: Adams Cafe,
W12, (081-743-0572), Bedlington Cafe, W4, (081-994-1965), Diwana Bhel-Poori,
N1, (071-387-5556), Le Petit Max, Hampton Wick, (081-977-0236), Phillies,
W4, (081-995-5104).
Melbournes in Bristol (0272-226996), Pophams in Winkleigh, Devon,
(0837-83767) and Chinese Home Cooking in Edinburgh (031-2294404) are also
BYO.

FT  10 JUL 93 / Gardening: Where hefty buyers lurk
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN LANE FOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SKY has been as blue as the best delphiniums; the cut-price pottery is
out in force; and today and tomorrow, starting at 10 am, you can combine two
of England's favourite weekend pastimes by trying to head for the Hampton
Court flower show.
This event is in only its fourth year but already it is a popular hit and,
if you can reach it, it allows you to look at flowers and shop
simultaneously. But shopping and flower-gazing depend on two major hazards:
the M25 and British Rail's Network SouthEast. On press day, I escaped both,
but I must warn you that the overflow car parks were well filled all down
the Twickenham road.
For the first time, the show has come under the management of the Royal
Horticultural Society. So have the prices: entry costs Pounds 14 an adult
and Pounds 7 a child between five and 15. An average family must allow
Pounds 42 for entrance with another Pounds 6 for the car park - or at least
Pounds 20 for the journey on British Rail from central London.
There is also a champagne tent to negotiate. It all made me wonder: by the
time He had bought a new accessory and She had bought something in straw
from the craft village, how were the vendors of good garden plants in the
main marquees going to sell anything in quantity.
I soon stopped wondering. Since Wednesday, active planters have been
scrambling to hand over fivers for clematis from such exhibitors as the
Valley Nurseries, Lincoln, or perennials from Hardy's Cottage Plants,
Hampshire.
Like the show itself, Hardy's is a recent arrival which I noted at Chelsea.
Its space there was limited by the RHS committee, but Hampton Court has
given it room to spread. It is showing anything from white verbascums to the
best white-and-red spotted phlox called Omega and a catmint (its idea but
not quite mine) of Nepeta Six Hills Giant. The planty people are loving it -
after all, there are not so many exhibits based on gardening rather than
florestry.
Hampton Court is certainly no Chelsea; nor should it ever become one. Where
plants are shown, there are fewer, and the staging has none of Chelsea's
scale or massive impression. The atmosphere is more like a county show with
country extras. The supreme difference is that almost anything is for sale
at Hampton Court.
As I look round my garden this weekend, I realise what good things have come
back to it from the past two Hampton Courts. Everything is pot-grown and
will transplant easily as soon as it rains: the great advantage is that you
can see it and buy it on the spot.
Nonetheless, this is England and gardening is part of the countryside. At a
summer show, the countryside means heritage and, in this, the English have
no rivals at enlarging the definition. At an English summer horse show, you
can buy sheepskin coats, fudge, Range Rovers, barbecues and almost anything
except a horse. A few people watch the dressage but many more want the right
sort of quilted under-garments.
At Hampton Court, a few people may share my interest in the fine erodiums
from the NCCPG collection - but many more want pots from Spain, mohair
fashion knitware, and the right sort of hat from Tony Conner, of Eton. He
sells 'Hats for the Gentry'; his 'Old Etonian' is a straw number from
Ecuador.
Without the shopping, I am not sure I would enjoy it enough to spend a day
with the crowds. The best value among the cheap pottery seemed to me to be
Earlfarm in section C17: you can almost recoup the cost of the entry ticket
on the difference between its oriental pots and those in retail shops.
If price is no object, head for the conservatories where there is something
to suit almost nobody's pocket. One corner of the showground is dominated by
a huge, Gothic conservatory, custom-made by the staff at Oak Leaf, of York
(tel. 0904-690 401).
The kind young man with the press kit explained that the cost price - not
the retail - was Pounds 100,000 complete with blinds, tiled flooring from
Paris, ceramics at Pounds 60 a metre and curved glass. The price, however,
was merely for the record as the entire thing had been pre-sold.
Next door, Amdega of Darlington (0325-468 522) can do you a simpler model
for Pounds 30,000 - excluding blinds, flooring and installation. I think I
prefer it to the Gothic - but did not the two exhibits look familiar? Their
exhibitors confessed that both had been given a pre-run at Chelsea, where
Oak Leaf had found its buyer.
Gardeners who look at glasshouses should not be the people to throw stones;
but while you cope with the success of Hampton Court, and negotiate stalls
with names like Doughcraft, remember that among the knitwear with floral
influence and the hand-painted buttons, there will be at least one hefty
buyer at work.

FT  10 JUL 93 / Science under the microscope: Modern forensics raise serious
questions of civil liberty
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LARRY KLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ABOUT 100 years ago, a certain John H Watson, MD, arrived in London and met
someone with whom to share lodgings. The doctor was warned that this fellow
was a little queer in his ideas: his enthusiasm for science could be
bizarre.
The two of them met at a hospital's chemical laboratory. At the sound of
Watson's approach, he leapt up with a cry. 'I've found it] I have found a
re-agent which is precipitated by haemoglobin, and by nothing else. Why,
man, it is the most practical medico-legal discovery for years . . . It
gives us an infallible test for blood stains . . .'
A few days later, Sherlock Holmes and Dr Watson set up joint residence at
221B Baker Street.
'Holmes was on the right track,' says Robin Keeley, head of the analytical
chemistry department at London's Metropolitan Police Forensic Science
Laboratory (MPFSL). 'My colleagues tell me that Holmes' constant admonitions
about too little attention being given to shoeprints can still be
appropriate.
'However, Watson was less than prophetic when he claimed Holmes had 'brought
detection as near to an exact science as it ever will be brought in this
world'.'
Robin Keeley and the other 220 scientists at the MPFSL - arguably the most
respected laboratory of its kind in the world - are confident of their
state-of-the-art tools, techniques and methods of examination. But they are
also disturbed by their profession's lack of esteem.
As the efficacy of forensic science grew, so did its use, especially as the
courts increasingly sought corroborative expert advice in support of
circumstantial evidence and confessions obtained by the police. Today, there
is hardly any serious crime that is detected that does not involve forensic
science.
But never has it been so controversial, and nowhere is this truer than in
Sherlock Holmes' England, where a royal commission of enquiry into the
criminal justice system issued its report this week.
The commission was set up in the wake of the March 1991 acquittal of the
Birmingham Six, who had spent 16 years in jail for alleged IRA terrorism.
Their acquittal was based in large part on the discrediting of forensic
evidence. The government said at the time that the inquiry was designed 'to
minimise as far as possible the likelihood of such events happening again.'
This aim may yet be achieved, but the embarrassment for ministers, police,
judges, lawyers and forensic scientists continued almost unabated. In
addition to the Birmingham Six, further acquittals saw the release of the
Guildford Four, the Maquire Seven and the Tottenham Three, among others.
Scientists at the MPFSL say their laboratory was not deeply involved in the
now-overturned sensational terrorist convictions of the 1970s.
The main forensic evidence for these came from laboratories operated
directly by the government. The Metropolitan Police laboratory itself is the
only one in Britain, and possibly the world, run directly by the police and
with an entirely civilian scientific staff.
However, MPFSL scientists agree with their counterparts in government
laboratories that the reforms adopted since the 1970s have already provided
important extra safeguards in the quality control of forensic examination
itself, and in promoting disclosure to the defence of evidence that might be
damaging to the prosecution.
In the more controversial convictions that were subsequently overturned,
evidence had been produced to demonstrate virtually conclusively that some
of the defendants had handled explosives. It later emerged that similar
results might have been produced by the handling of soap or boot polish.
Of all the criticisms levelled at forensic science, the one that draws the
most emphatic response from Brian Sheard, director of the MPFSL, is the
accusation that forensic scientists are secret and conspiratorial.
'The laboratory is an open organisation,' he says. 'We are obliged by law,
and believe it to be right, to make all our results available to the
defence. The defence are always welcome here. They are welcome to make their
own examinations. Our people will not interfere, except to help.'
Conversations with Dr Sheard's staff bear him out. Apart from an
understandable refusal to have their photographs taken front-on, and some
reluctance to reveal techniques that might help criminals avoid detection,
they display an openness in discussing their work that is uncommon in most
big companies and government ministries.
'Our role is to put expert evidence and interpretation before the courts,'
says Keeley, 'not simply to try to put people in jail. We are scientists,
which means we must maintain openness of mind.
'Almost ironically, some of our scientists feel uneasy about doing work only
for the defence, because, unlike the prosecution, they are not required to
freely make available results that might be embarrassing. To be able to bury
inconvenient information sits very uncomfortably with many scientists.
'What people do not generally realise is that a lot of our work involves
establishing innocence rather than guilt, to eliminate suspects from
investigation, and as early as possible. Nearly 20 per cent of our DNA
(genetic profiling) work produces that result.'
Although Britain pioneered the development of finger-printing in the second
half of the 19th century, modern forensic science was late in arriving in
London.
Now, the Met's laboratory, in central London, is the largest in Europe,
probably the best-equipped, and is renowned for pioneering work in the
development of scientific methods applied to crime.
It helps to bear in mind three things about the MPFSL's work. First, much of
its routine work involves establishing whether a crime has, in fact, been
committed.
Second, almost all the laboratory's work involves corroborative, not
investigative, work. The MPFSL's investigative work centres on only two of
its units, both with specialised mobile laboratories and staff.
The Serious Crimes Unit can be involved in any major crime - murder, rape,
armed robbery - and in many ways, such as applying chemical methods to
discover blood stains. However, more than 90 per cent of its work involves
discovering and developing latent fingerprints on surfaces such as shiny
cars and dull paper such as cheques and airline boarding passes. In turn,
the Fire Investigation Unit visits all fire scenes and some types of
explosions in which death or serious injury has occured and virtually all
where arson is suspected.
Third, the corrobative work, while involving sophisticated techniques, is
still often analogous to the long-established practice in dealing with
fingerprints: comparing in painstaking detail evidence 'lifted' at the scene
of a crime with evidence obtained from a suspect.
For example, MPFSL scientists can demonstrate with varying degrees of
certainty that a minute strand of fibre found at the scene came from a
jacket discovered in a suspect's home. They cannot prove that the suspect
was at the scene, only that the jacket probably was.
Keeley can not only demonstrate that the wearer of that jacket recently
discharged a firearm, but also that he carried a cigarette lighter, and
therefore probably smoked - or, from certain chemical elements, that he had
been involved in the cooking of food, and thus, if a man, might have been
living alone.
Similarly, a floor down from Keeley, Pam Hamer and her colleagues spend a
lot of time peering through microscopes to compare the soles of suspects'
shoes with scene-of-crime shoeprints. As with the fingerprint's complex
ridges, troughs and swirls, the shoeprint has a complicated pattern of wear,
tear, scuffs, nicks and repair marks.
The firearms section is headed by Brian Arnold, whose statistics bear out a
depressing increase in the criminal use of guns, especially in robbery;
here, revolving vices and paired high-powered microscopes compare myriad
rifling, breach and firing-pin marks.
But there is one department of forensic science where the finger-printing
analogy is so marked that it has created a widespread misconception, one so
strong as to complicate the already complex debate over the profession's
most controversial development since the advert of finger-printing
techniques.
'The popular term 'genetic fingerprinting,' which unfortunately is even used
by some experts, is misleading,' says Cecelia Buffery, a specialist in the
laboratory's DNA section. 'The main trouble seems to be that the early
practitioners, especially in the US, made claims that couldn't be
substantiated.
'Genetic profiling is still not uniquely identifying, though it may become
so as the technology grows.' Until then, it will continue to reflect
probabilities, not certainties, though very high probabilities. 'However,'
says Buffery, 'this is not to say that DNA profiling is anything less than a
very powerful technique.'
But controversy remains. It centres on the strength of the probabilities,
but includes serious civil liberties questions. For example, should the
police have the right to take DNA samples from suspects or those convicted?
Should DNA results obtained from innocent people be kept in databases? Some
of these questions were addressed in the royal commission's report this
week. Among 352 recommendations was a call for an independent forensic
science advisory council to oversee standards.
While it is hyperbole to say that forensic science is on trial, it is true
to say it is under the microscope - and that Watson, though possibly not
Holmes, would still be amazed.

FT  10 JUL 93 / Superstar route for royalty: John Lloyd has been ploughing
through the torrent of books on the British monarchy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OF THE books about the British monarchy published in the first half of this
year, the majority advertise in their titles that they are diagnoses of
sickness, even death.
Two proclaim the fall of the House of Windsor. One gets 'behind palace
doors.' Another borrows law court language - Diana v Charles - to emphasise
the hectic distaste which the Prince and Princess of Wales conceived for
each other. A fifth sees the crown as 'tarnished.' A sixth boldly
psychoanalyses the family. A seventh homes in upon the royal marriages with
the ruthless eye of the scandal-monger.
The books are themselves a pathology, for the four journalist-authors -
Nigel Dempster/Peter Evans, Anthony Holden and James Whitaker - were all
scribe-courtiers of, even fawners on, their subjects. Now they take the
insouciant high ground of the scornful know-all, seeing 'nothing but
lechery' wherever they look.
For the writer A N Wilson, the most disdainful of them, the behaviour of
Charles, above all, has been a betrayal of trust. Wilson is forced to
suggest an unlikely alienation of the monarchy from the Windsor family in
order to preserve it.
One of the two Ladies writing, Lady Colin Campbell, is a distant relation by
marriage to the British royal family and to 'most of the royal houses of
Europe,' and is bitchily revelatory, whisking aside bedroom curtains across
a continent and four generations.
The one academic, a former Labour politician turned radical, Stephen
Haseler, sees the pass to which sex has brought the monarchy as the starting
point for his vigorous, neo-conservative republicanism.
Other critical books have been published since the second world war - that
is, in the period when the royal family became the Holy Family (a myth
started not by the present Queen but by her mother, that hard nut with a
creamy, sweet coating). But Percy Black's Mystique of Modern Royalty and
Kingsley Martin's Crown and Establishment, for example, were chiding, not
radical.
In the late 1980s, two books were published which, although resigned to the
continuation of popular sycophancy, nevertheless began to strike chords. The
doughty republican Edgar Wilson's Myth of the British Monarchy appeared in
1989. More stylish was the Scots Marxist Tom Nairn's book, The Enchanted
Glass (1988). It was a meditation on royalty and its acceptance in British
public and fantasy life.
It was good stuff, but what else would you expect from a Scots Marxist? The
fact that it attracted attention was not due to left-wing agitation but to
something quite different: to the best impulses of Thatcherism - a
dispassionate and undeferential questioning of the way we organise
ourselves. This questioning left its mark everywhere, and has permitted some
curious alliances in the 1990s - as on royalty. Linked to this was the
growing lack of inhibition of the popular press.
Although they prepared the ground, the Thatcherites retreated from it
because deference was still too strong in their bones. The most radical of
them - Keith Joseph, Norman Tebbit, David Young and Margaret Thatcher
herself - all in the end were too bourgeois to press the logic they had
unleashed. They bowed the knee and took the peerage route into the
decompression chamber of British public life.
Behind them, however, they left a right-radical popular press, led by The
Sun, without the restraining influence of the leader herself. In the past
two years the press has launched attacks more forcefully and promiscuously
than ever before, reaching deep into previously taboo heartland. The medium
for this travel into the forbidden zone was sex. These books, with the
exception of that written by the Roundhead Haseler, are full of it.
This is natural enough. The British monarchy has much more of a duty to
reproduce than to rule. Alone among the state functionaries of Britain, the
monarch's sex life can be reasonably said to be of public interest.
The lamp of the media's attention has been hottest on Charles: he has
melted, though not completely. Most of the books, especially Holden's and
Wilson's, view the prince with real contempt, ridiculing his intellectual
pretensions, his vacillation over marriage and his finally surly resignation
in marrying.
Whitaker, with the wariness of a tabloid reporter who cannot afford to
offend a future king - although he, as the others, doubts that Charles will
now make it - is less censorious. He makes the even-handed, sad comment that
'put at its crudest it came to this: he needed someone to produce a future
king, she desperately wanted to be Princess of Wales.' On balance he prefers
the princess with whom, on his account, he has had a number of
heart-to-hearts, especially just before the wedding - conversations which
were clearly of great value (financially as well as emotionally) to him.
The male authors all agree that the princess was ready to love, but that she
ran up against Charles' desire to carry on with a routine of duty,
philosophising, polo, fishing and, ultimately, adultery.
In a soupy pre-marriage interview, both Charles and Diana were asked if they
were in love. She simpered assent. He gave his, then added: 'Whatever love
means.' Since that was not part of the wedding-of-the-epoch script, it was
made little of. However, today's republicans-come-lately see it as the
emotional viper in the bosom of the marriage.
Diana, already sanctified by Andrew Morton's Diana - a powerful and mythic
work - has a much better time of it from the authors. All note her dimness,
her ambition and, by far her most important characteristic, her
chameleon-like nature.
With tabloid economy, Whitaker puts it best: 'She had a knack for picking up
the gestures that define a personality.' Holden, quoting the US author
Camilla Paglia, says that Diana 'may have become the most powerful image in
the world today, a case study in the modern cult of celebrity and the way in
which it stimulates atavistic religious emotions.' And he lists the
stereotypes at which she now takes a turn: 'Cinderella, betrayed wife,
princess in the tower, mater dolorosa, pagan goddess, Hollywood queen and
beautiful boy.'
Lady Campbell is the notable dissenter from the general view that the
princess is the more sinned against. She has written a magnificent book
whose veracity it is completely impossible to determine, though her blood
ties to the royal families of Britain and Europe would in nobler times have
removed any doubt as to her word.
She is in every bed chamber, including that of the queen and the many
occupied by the Duke of Edinburgh. Of Charles, she believes that a man in
his position will, after the duty is done, take a mistress or mistresses.
Diana's inability to tolerate this appears to her 'irrational and childish.'
She presents the princess as a tantrum-prone bully without the intelligence
to grasp what was expected of her and the stakes for which she was gambling.
Of course, the famous 'Camillagate' (Prince Charles) and 'Squidgy' (Diana)
tapes are represented in both Dempster's and Whitaker's book. The tapes'
contents are well known. I found the Prince's conversation touching to the
point of feeling a stab of sympathy for him, and Diana's deportment while
she was being grossly flattered by James Gilbey unnervingly self-controlled
and narcissistic.
Can the greatest surviving monarchy on earth live through this? As rational
British citizens, we must hope not. But we must also - knowing the depth of
its cunning, the rotundity of its purse and the reserves of popularity it
still commands - fear that it can.
The answer to its survival lies with Diana. In her embrace of stardom and in
her ability to lend herself to a series of pre-determined images  -
especially of the 'caring' sort now so much in vogue - she has mapped out a
route that her sister-in-law, Princess Anne, has already discovered in a
lower-key way.
The British royal family can survive as charity superstars. They must be
ruthless with their ceremonial, trimming it to what is amusing and splendid
on occasion. They must open up not just Buckingham Palace but all the
palaces, including the so-called 'private possessions' like Balmoral and
Sandringham - in reality, as Holden writes, the product of Queen Victoria's
adroit begging for public finance. And they must open all the art and other
collections.
They must create, probably outside London, the largest and best designed
royal museum-cum-funpark in the world - a royal Disneyland. They must accept
that clever accountancy is not the option for them that it is for most of
the rich. They must eschew the marginal controversies which they have
stirred up in the past in favour of being deeply, broadly, constantly
caring.
It will be pretty sickly, but it might keep the show on the road, sparing us
the horror of having to vote for a head of state like lesser races do.

FT  10 JUL 93 / Fashion: Perfect shirts - Lucia van der Post visits Hilditch
&amp; Key
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ANYBODY who has ever read The Great Gatsby will remember the description of
Gatsby's shirts 'piled like bricks in stacks a dozen high'. So beautiful
were these 'shirts of sheer linen and thick silk and fine flannel' they made
Daisy cry. They came, it hardly needs saying, from England which is still
the home of the finest of the fine, still the place to which international
designers turn when in search of that illusive thing: the perfect shirt.
Take Karl Lagerfeld. All his personal shirts, which run to somewhere between
100 and 200 a year, are made for him by the old-established Jermyn Street
shirtmaker, Hilditch &amp; Key. More than that, H &amp; K also makes all the catwalk
shirts for his shows - for Chanel, Chloe, Lagerfeld and Fendi. Pompidou and
Greta Garbo, Marlene Dietrich and M Balladur have all been
fans of the Hilditch &amp; Key way with two-fold cotton poplin.
Making truly high-quality shirts in these mass- manufacturing days is a
niche business, never likely, because of the costs and the handwork
involved, to make its owners rich. Michael Booth, who bought H &amp; K 17 years
ago when it had a turnover of Pounds 200,000 a year and sold between 1,000
and 1,500 shirts, has taken it to the point where today it has a turnover of
about Pounds 4m and sells between 60,000 and 70,000 shirts a year. He sees
it as a small, specialised business which is almost a last bastion of
traditional shirt-making skills.
Given that there are, as Booth puts it, 'lots of reasonable shirts around'
selling at about Pounds 25 a time, why is it that shirtmakers such as H &amp; K
need to charge anything between Pounds 55 (H &amp; K's lowest price in normal
times) and Pounds 115 (Turnbull &amp; Asser's top price) for their wares? With
good quality shirts what counts is, as the late Lord Marks is alleged to
have said in another context, 'detail, detail, detail.'
They should be made of fine two-fold cotton poplin. If made of striped
material the stripes should be matched on the placket, on a split yoke,
between the shoulders and sleeve, as well as on the pocket and on the
gauntlet attached to the sleeves.
The stitching also tells a lot. Single-needle stitching is much stronger and
therefore finer than double-stitching (which is faster and cheaper). The
collar should be made of two pieces with removable bones for a better fit
and longer wear. Buttons should be mother of pearl and the back of the shirt
should be 2 cm longer than the front - so that it will not come out.
And if all that attention to detail seems wasted on a mere man H &amp; K now has
a range for women - mostly made from the same two-fold cotton poplin but
there are some in linen and a few in silk, some classic, some highly
fashionable.

FT  10 JUL 93 / Fashion: Victory to the cavaliers of style - The women's
fashion press divides into two sects
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE MULVAGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FEMALE fashion press can be divided into two sects: the timid puritans
and the flamboyant catholics. While the puritans, the larger sect, favour
austere, androgynous, all-black dress, giving the appearance of low-church
parsons, it is the catholics who keep the business going and restore our
delight in personal decoration.
The rarer brethren dress up not only for their own amusement but also for
those around them. Whim, humour, invention and surprise are their
commandments. At British Vogue, fashion director Lucinda Chambers'
historicism and the foppishness of features associate Issey Delves Broughton
have inspired many designers. The ethnic eclecticism of the freelance
stylist Debbie Mason, hyacinth-and-peridot check tweeds of Hamish Bowles
(American Vogue), the Fellini-esque costumes of Anna Piaggi (Italian Vogue)
and the Van Dyck jabots and Restoration jewels of Suzy Menkes (International
Herald Tribune), display their role as the catholic high priests.
When I joined Vogue in the early 1980s the editor, Beatrix Miller - a
catholic in Calvinist clothing - encouraged a spontaneity and imagination in
dress. The rarest bird in her aviary was Grace Coddington, a 1960s model
turned stylist.
Every few months she would shed her plumage and arise phoenix-like with a
new image. One month she was a Left Bank ingenue, with cropped hair, Breton
T-shirt, cigarette pants and ballet pumps, the next her hair seemed to have
grown rapidly and she was a pilgrim on an American prairie or an Elizabethan
heroine framed in white lace.
'Bea' loved her cavaliers; be it Jane Ormsby-Gore who ransacked her
ancestors' dressing-up trunks for a floor-length, Dick Turpin cape and a
mammoth 'drugs dealer' felt hat whose feathers tickled the corridor walls,
or Delves Broughton with her velvet, diamante-buttoned frock coat, laddered
fishnets and dizzily high silk-satin mules.
During my first week there I learned that at Vogue there is an outfit for
every occasion. Walking into the loo one day I found a gaggle of assistants
crowded round a cubicle and went over to investigate. Coddington had eaten a
bad oyster. One of her assistants protested: 'She can't get sick in her
Calvins - go and get her Levis.' At Vogue there is even an outfit for
getting sick in]
Busy men (Lord Snowdon and Sy Newhouse, the chairman of Conde Nast) would
pop into Vogue House just to see what Chambers was wearing. Would it be her
Gandhi-esque dhotis made from muslin wrapped round her lower torso and worn
with one of her 1940s blouses, Tuscan straw clogs and huge straw hat
decorated with fresh flowers, or a 19th century peasant smock over gold
leather, Glam-Rock jeans?
I remember dismounting from my bicycle one summer morning, dressed in a
white Victorian camisole, bloomers and ballet shoes - quite normal, I
thought, until I heard one of the doormen mutter: 'In my day if I got my
girl down to that I knew I was in business]'
You realised terminal 'fashionitis' had set in when you heard yourself
saying at dinner parties: 'But everyone has a pair of beige, peg-topped
Armani trousers, don't they?' Once a fashion girl starts talking like a
caption it is time for rehabilitation.
For the fashion press the trick is to devise a look and stick to it no
matter what delight or folly is served up as the latest thing, thereby
avoiding bankruptcy and sartorial schizophrenia. Few manage to walk this
tightrope without succumbing to a 'buzz' haircut (shaved up the back of the
neck), platforms or Japanese deconstructionism.
One who managed it was the minimalist Sophie Hicks, now an architect. At 17
she started wearing men's clothes, initially Death in Venice sailor suits,
and to this day she still wears bespoke Savile Row suits, to show-off her
short boyish hair and scrubbed complexion.
One of the interesting conversions of late has been that of Menkes to almost
papal stature within the catholic ranks. The enlightenment came when she
moved from London to Paris. She discarded her London vestments  - sober,
unmemorable - in favour of dress that recalls the confidence of the Farnese
papal dynasty, the colour verve of the Fauvists and the trinket collecting
of an African chieftain laden with talismanic tribal necklaces and
bracelets. She embodies high fashion luxury and decoration and sports the
insignia of the trade's chief catholics: permanent sunglasses, laptop
computer, and her idiosyncratic signature a bouffant coiffure in the shape
of a cottage loaf.
These limousine-sheltered creatures are, on the whole, the exceptions. Many
rank-and-file fashion journalists dress in a dreary and undecorative,
sexless manner. And yet these are the women who pontificate from their pages
on how our wardrobes should look. Why? Timidity born of knowledge, I would
guess. Rather than make a sartorial mistake, they play safe, avoiding
colour, pattern and frill. They defensively argue that black is modern,
classless, slimming and cheap and, being constantly on the road, they can
travel light, for everything matches.
Their shibboleths are leggings, tailored trousers or leather jeans, leather
biker's jackets (which Sir Hardy Amies refers to sniffily as 'anoraks'),
John Smedley polo necks, white shirts and a quilted leather Chanel handbag
rucksack or purse, all in colour-shy black.
They also favour sanitised and risibly expensive street-culture accessories
 -baseball caps, biker's boots, bumbags slung over non-existent bellies -
borrowed by 'witty Karl' (of Chanel) from clubland. Even the middle-aged are
sometimes lured into such youth gear. And yet, this puritan sect is at pains
to avoid looking feminine lest they be admonished for arousal.
The occasional deviations into decoration remind one of the black magpie's
attraction to gaudy geegaws: swags of cheap gilt chains, pinchbeck snaffles
and confidence-boosting logos. Weighed down with such fool's gold they
conjure up images of provincial mayors parading their decorations of office
or, worse, a gilt chain gang of slaves to the mode.

FT  10 JUL 93 / How to Spend It: Designers with the future in their hands -
A series of exhibitions which show the breadth and vitality of Britain's
young talent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETA LEVI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHETHER IT is a dining table or a button that you want to buy or commission,
the New Designers exhibition promises to be a happy hunting ground. Here is
the chance to see work by more than 1,000 of Britain's best graduates, the
creme de la creme of designers from some 50 different colleges all over the
country. If you want to buy contemporary jewellery, ceramics, glass,
cushions, scarves - even furniture or a rug - there will be lots to choose
from.
Best of all the DTI (through Lady Denton, parliamentary under secretary of
state for consumer affairs and small businesses) has invited some 7,000
industrialists to a preview for the first time since the exhibition started
10 years ago. For, though the exhibition is highly popular with consumers
(last year about 14,000 people visited it), the response from industrialists
has been deeply disappointing. This time the DTI is determined to make sure
that those running Britain's manufacturing industries are aware of just how
remarkable Britain's pool of design talent is. At the preview on July 14,
Lady Denton will present awards worth Pounds 24,000 sponsored by industry
and City livery companies.
Not everything on display will be for sale - in among the jewellery and the
ceramics, the glass and the furniture will be prototypes or paper designs
which their designers will be anxiously hoping to sell to manufacturers.
On the whole the experience of graduating designers is depressing - few
British industrialists seem prepared to invest in employing a designer or in
developing new products, in tooling or in the strong marketing that new
products require. Over the last few years this has meant increasing numbers
of design graduates have had to set up in business themselves, doing
everything from sub-contracting the manufacturing and overseeing the
development of their products to trying to market them.
Many young design businesses founder because they cannot do all these tasks
and because they often cannot afford to promote and market their products
internationally. To try and help them I started New Designers in Business
last year.
This informal group of 60 fledgling design businesses with distinctly slim
funding (a mere Pounds 15,000 from sponsorship), has already taken part in
11 international trade fairs including New York, Amsterdam, Dubai and
Cologne.
Petter Southall, a Dorset furniture designer, says: 'Our business owes its
existence to NDB's help with exhibitions and press coverage. Last year our
turnover increased by 30 per cent and 60 per cent of our total turnover was
due directly or indirectly to NDB.'
Helen Sayer, a Birmingham textile designer, was spotted at an exhibition by
a Japanese company and won a Pounds 6,000 order for banners. A German car
manufacturer commissioned Pounds 45,000 worth of chairs from furniture
designers Tom Layton and Alan Perks of FiT and Neil Bottle has exported
Pounds 45,000 worth of textiles to the Far East and the US.
You can see work by these designers at another exhibition, New Designers in
Business at Wolff Olins (Regents Wharf, All Saints Street, London N1), by
the canal behind Kings Cross five minutes from the Business Design Centre.
The NDB collection is open on 15 and 16 July (10am to 5pm) to coincide with
the two Business Design Centre exhibitions - and thereafter by appointment.
It will have work by 60 new designers who have graduated over the last three
years. All the work is in production and it includes a wide range of
domestic artefacts from furniture, lighting, ceramics, glass to textiles and
metalwork.
Also at the Business Design Centre is a second smaller exhibition, 'One Year
On', of the work of 25 graduates, some of last year's 'New Designers' who
have set up in business.
One trend evident at all three exhibitions is experimentation with metals -
mild steel, sheet metal, tubular steel, aluminium, bronze, brass, copper,
silver, gold and pewter - and with techniques for colouring and patinating.
For many years designers have concentrated on casting metal but now they are
rediscovering the pleasures of working this malleable material.
Sophie Wilkinson, a 'One Year On' exhibitor, says: 'Metal is a substantial
material, not easily destroyed which can be worked in many different ways -
you can forge, weld, hammer, emboss, bend, cut and decorate it.' Sophie, a
Middlesex University graduate, makes decorative bowls from scrap steel. She
plasma-cuts old ballcock valves and patinates them in subtle coppers and
bronzes, blues and greens.
The new metalwork varies enormously. On view at 'New Designers' are fine
pieces of jewellery sitting side by side with large scale architectural
work. Particularly striking are three large sculptures in forged steel by
Peter Clarke, incorporating copper, bronze and gilded metals. They include a
weather vane and a bird's station - the bird's nest is in the shape of an
egg, and metal leaves act as water collectors for the bird baths. Peter,
aged 40, is one of a growing number of mature students. He spent most of his
life in the cloth trade. After being made redundant he did a foundation
course at Sir John Cass and a 3-D metal course at Camberwell College of
Arts. He hopes that through 'New Designers' more people will see and like
his work and that more commissions will come his way.
By contrast (but illustrating the breadth of the Camberwell course), Eleanor
Kearney is developing a range of pewter tableware. She did her own market
research on companies which still manufacture pewter and approached
Wentworth the Pewterers in Sheffield, who were prepared to make a prototype
of her teapot (for sale at Pounds 220). She hopes to batch-produce the
teapot, develop a tea service for manufacture and start a mail-order service
to bring the price down.
Kent Institute of Art &amp; Design's excellent silversmithing course has
regularly produced winners of the Worshipful Company of Goldsmiths' awards
at New Designers. Two winners, Steve Ottewill and Justin Richardson, who
have just set up in business together, will be exhibiting their magnificent
silver tableware, including water jugs and goblets, in the 'One Year On'
exhibition.
In the same exhibition is a fully operational telephone, encased in a 5 ft
tall welded steel man, which encapsulates the philosophy of many new
designers - to make every-day objects interesting to look at and a pleasure
to use. What a client-catcher in, say, an advertising office]
Jane Atfield, who graduated from the RCA last year, is one of the
disappointingly few designers currently experimenting with recycled
materials - she uses brightly-coloured plastics for her chairs and rags for
the upholstery.
If the end of the last decade saw an explosion of new metalwork, the 1990s
may herald a new product age. Watch out for the product designers on the
Brunel, Sheffield and Teeside University stands at 'New Designers.' Perhaps
this time next year production Patrick Johnson's fibre-optic cable security
system, Sarah Beattie's hand-held sewing machine and Christopher Dumont's
portable coffee maker will all be in production. But who will be producing
them? New Designers and One Year On are on at the Business Design Centre, 52
Upper Street, Islington, London N1 from 15 to 18 July. Opening hours are
from 10am-8pm on July 15, from 10 am to 6 pm on 16 and 17 July and from 10
am to 4 pm on 18 July. New Designers is sponsored and organised by the
Business Design Centre.
New Designers in Business is at Wolff Olins, 10 Regents Wharf, All Saints
Street, London N1 on 15 and 16 July from 10am to 5pm and thereafter by
appointment with Peta Levi (fax 071-435-5487).
One Year On will go to the Spacex Gallery, 45 Preston Street, Exeter EX1 1DF
from 6 August to 4 September where it will be open from Tues-Sat, 10am to
5pm.

FT  10 JUL 93 / Minding Your Own Business: The art of running a gallery -
The hard work behind the popping wine corks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HEATHER FARMBROUGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'IT IS a myth,' says Anna-Mei Chadwick, 'that running an art gallery is all
about opening shows and bottles of wine.'
Five days after the birth of each of her children, she was back at work at
her gallery in London's Parsons' Green. She regularly works 10 hours a day,
seven days a week. Yet when she advertised recently for a part time
assistant in The Guardian, she received 1,000 applications.
Although she was an art market correspondent for seven years, Anna-Mei
regards herself first and foremost as a retailer.
'The retail trade is very tough - you need stamina and a lot of help,' she
says. 'Dealing with the general public takes a certain strength. Anybody can
walk through that door - this year we've had a record number of flashers.'
As the gallery has established a reputation for showing works by both
acknowledged and unknown artists, every week several artists walk in
uninvited trying to persuade her to exhibit their work.
In 1986, Anna-Mei was the art market correspondent for the Antiques Trade
Gazette when she realised she had learnt so much about art galleries she
could run her own.
With the early 1980s passion for prints on the wane, she felt there was an
opportunity to sell affordable art. She found a 1,500 sq ft site on the New
King's Road in Parsons' Green and after a long unsuccessful search for a
suitable name for the gallery, a marketing friend suggested she used her
own. She did, and the gallery opened in the autumn.
Initially, she approached artists she knew and found others by going to open
shows and competitions. She concentrates on artists with promise who are not
necessarily well-known. In the early days, most paintings sold for under
Pounds 500; nowadays Pounds 500 is the average price with a limit of Pounds
6,000. To keep costs down, she insists frames should be inexpensive and
simple.
She tries to create a firm market in her artists' pictures. 'We don't pay
retainers and don't have exclusive contracts with our artists, so we rely on
their loyalty to come back,' she explains. 'We have a set commission for all
our artists and pay within 30 days of the end of the show which is unusual.
Our artists know we don't juggle around with the prices on the wall. If you
give discounts then people know the pictures on the wall were overpriced in
the first place. Besides, if people came in from the City they'd beat me on
the haggling.'
At the first one-man show in 1987, featuring the paintings of Roy Freer,
just three paintings were sold at the private view. By 1991, clients queued
for hours outside before his show opened. That evening, Pounds 30,000 was
turned over. That, says Anna-Mei, was exceptional.
Each year, the gallery runs some 17 shows, some shared. The summer
exhibition displays the work of about 30 artists. Private views cost Pounds
2,000: 'People always think the expensive part must be the wine, but a
couple of cases of wine cost nothing compared with printing the invitations
and sending them out,' she says.
Attendance is unpredictable, although the presence of one or two celebrities
invariably helps. 'One of the lowest turn-outs was the night that England
played in the World Cup semi-final against Germany, although we did very
well that night because the people who came were all serious about buying,'
she recalls. The recession has had a similar effect: fewer people come to
shows than in the late 1980s, but those who do, often buy.
This year, Anna-Mei expects turnover to reach Pounds 250,000. Although it
has risen steadily since the gallery opened, it was two years before she
took on a full time assitant - and then only because her first child was due
in a month's time. She now employs one full-time and one part-time assistant
but feels even if she could afford to take on more, she would still need to
be in the gallery much of the time. Clients and artists expect to see her.
'Running an art gallery is a very personal business - you have to be there,
rather than an assistant. It's not like running a chain of shops.'
When she started, her husband, a chartered accountant, took care of the
book-keeping. Over the years, Anna-Mel has taken this over. Rent is the main
cost, then wages. It has not been all plain sailing: a computer supplier
went bankrupt and there have been burst mains and a flood. She has also had
to install security tags to counter the pilfering of prints.
The clientele and stock of artists were boosted in 1989 when Anna-Mei bought
the client list and artists' names from Karen McGrath, the owner of the
McGrath gallery on Richmond Hill, which was closing down. In spite of the
offer of partnership with a West End gallery, she has preferred to keep the
gallery small and independent while the children are young and has no desire
to move to the West End.
Besides, she says, being small means 'you can do your own thing and afford
to make one or two mistakes.' The worst of these was when her former
assistant rang a client's wife to inform her that she could collect a
painting bought by her husband. It was then discovered that he had actually
bought it for his mistress.

FT  10 JUL 93 / Minding Your Own Business: Three rules for staying in the
saddle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SUZANNE ASKHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'BUSINESS plan? Waste of paper,' pronounces Athene English with the
confidence that comes with survival.
From her shop in Hay-on-Wye, on the Welsh Borders, Athene makes by hand, and
sells, a range of bags, wallets, saddlery, hunting and shooting items. Raw
materials include traditional English leathers, and 200-year-old Russian
reindeer skins recovered from a shipwreck. Items are costed by adding the
price of the raw material to labour, calculated at Pounds 5 an hour, then
applying a mark-ups of 33 per cent for wholesale buyers and up to 100 per
cent for retail. Off-the-peg retail prices range from Pounds 5.85 for a
reindeer key ring, to Pounds 1,450 for a reindeer attache case.
'The mark-up is reduced the more labour-intensive the item,' said Athene.
She began her working life as a professional horse-rider, became PA to the
managing director of Gucci, then helped run a small wine import business.
Drawing on all three experiences, she set up her own business, The English
Saddlery Company, in 1982. When she started she drew up the three rules that
have carried her through: 'One, I was going to produce the highest possible
quality work. Two, absolutely no credit extended. And three, no bank loans:
if my business didn't pay for itself, I would close it down.'
Athene did a one-year course in saddlery under Tops, a now-discontinued
government training scheme, She bought a set of hand tools for Pounds 250
the last of her TOPS grant. Then she moved to Cirencester - 'because it's a
well-hooved area' - and started trading. Her working capital was just Pounds
500.
Athene's survival in the early days was due largely to her location on
public view in the Cirencester Workshops where craftspeople enjoy subsidised
rents. 'I was paying around Pounds 20 a week,' she said.
Her first order was to make a parrot lead. 'I said yes to all commissions.
The satisfied customers passed the word around. That way, I built up a
strong local customer base.'
In the first year Athene's turnover was Pounds 5,000. Over the six years she
stayed at Cirencester, this rose to Pounds 13,000. Her customers included
international polo players, and a member of the royal family.
In 1989 she moved to Hay-on-Wye, close to where she grew up. She decided to
concentrate on the more commercially viable small leather goods. She changed
the company's name to the English Leather Company to reflect this policy. 'I
realised that I had to take my product to the market, build up a wider
clientele,' she said.
After talking to other leatherworkers, Athene decided to trawl the trade
shows. In 1989, she went to the New York International Gift Show, paying
Pounds 1,500 to exhibit. 'I didn't get a single order. It was a really low
point. I felt I had misjudged the market.'
One month later, a Japanese company which had been at the fair placed a
large order. Others followed. Japan and the US swiftly became big customers.
By the end of 1991, 75 per cent of business was export. Turnover that year
was Pounds 39,000. Recently she has stopped exhibiting. 'It was getting too
expensive, and my customer base was changing. Today, 60 per cent of my goods
are sold into the home market - increasingly by mail order, which now takes
up approximately 20 per cent of the total,' she said.
Turnover has grown steadily. Last year, it reached Pounds 54,000. The
problem today is insufficient manpower. Athene employs a part-time shop
assistant. Twelve months ago she started contracting out some items - about
10 per cent of orders - to three fellow craftsmen.
She has made a decision which will enable her to increase production and
relax a little. 'The Welsh Development Board is giving me a grant / loan
package worth a total of Pounds 6,000,' she explains. 'I'm investing in some
machinery to do routine tasks.' The grant also means she can employ two
administrative assistants, giving her the pleasure of going back to where
she began - simply making things.

FT  10 JUL 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Inheritance and house prices
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IN JANUARY 1991 my father died leaving an estate in which I was to inherit
four tenths of the monies remaining after the estate and probate had been
sorted out.
The estate had been placed into the hands of a solicitor as 'trustee and
executor' along with one other person.
The house was put on the market at Pounds 165,000 and with the remaining
bank accounts and shares the total was approximately Pounds 180,000.
I believe that a sum of around Pounds 20,000 has been paid to the Inland
Revenue, by the solicitor, in respect of inheritance tax. Subsequently
however, given the recession and the bad housing market, the house was sold
for Pounds 104,000 leaving the total amount of estate left at Pounds
119,000.
My question is, can I reclaim the inheritance tax already paid to the Inland
Revenue as the final figure does not reach the NIL rate band.
You should be able to take advantage of the provision which allows you to
substitute the sale proceeds of an asset for the probate value if that asset
is sold within three years of death. The claim to make this substitution
must be made by the executors who were liable to pay the tax. If the sale
price of the house together with the other assets falls within the nil rate
band, the inheritance tax paid could be reclaimed.
This reply was provided by Barry Stillerman of Accountants Stoy Hayward.

FT  10 JUL 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Separate accounts
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
HOW IMPORTANT is it for husbands and wives to maintain separate accounts in
order to satisfy the Inland Revenue that dividend and other income belongs
to one or the other?
We have separate interest-bearing accounts at the moment, and a joint cheque
account (either to sign) into which we transfer funds when necessary. But it
would be simpler (and produce a higher rate of interest) if we also had a
joint interest-bearing account into which all our funds were paid and to
which we both had free access.
Would the Revenue accept tax vouchers and P60s (my pension) as proof of the
receiver of the income for tax purposes?
If there have been no transfers of assets between you, then a joint
interest-bearing account should not cause any problems under the
anti-avoidance rules set out in, for example, section 674A of the Income and
Corporation Taxes Act 1988 (inserted by the Finance Act 1989, on the
introduction of independent taxation).
Ask your tax office for the free pamphlet IR80(1992) (Income tax and married
couples) or, if you want more details of the anti-avoidance provisions (and
extra-statutory concession), free booklet IR83 (1990) (Independent taxation:
a guide for tax practitioners).

I OWN Dresdner bank shares and have been unable to find out if I can get

Presumably, 25 per cent German withholding tax has been deducted from your

virtue of article VI of the FRG-UK double taxation convention (as amended in
1970), and the bank which collected the dividends for you will be able to
arrange for the appropriate refund from the German tax authorities.
You are indeed entitled to relief for the remaining 15 per cent German tax
against your UK tax liability, and you might like to ask your tax office for
the free booklet on double taxation relief, IR6.

FT  10 JUL 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: A string of problems
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
YOUR REPLY to the letter 'Wife can't be used as a tax puppet' (May 29/30)
caused us concern. Like many married couples, we have endeavoured to take
advantage of the legislation on separate taxation of women by equalising our
resources.
I gave my wife my tax-free lump sum on retirement, and wrote a simple letter
to her confirming this gift. She invested it in the Britannia Capital Trust
postal account in her sole name. Although I am an authorised signatory (in
the event of her demise), I have never used this power.
It is necessary that the income from this investment, together with my
pensions, are used for our living expenses. These are paid into a joint
account for this purpose. Any capital that is available is paid into her
Capital account.
Our anxiety is that, during these past three years, my wife has purchased
from her Capital account three general personal equity plans (in her name
and mine), three single-company Peps (in each name), and two Tessas. We each
select the shares in our own Peps.
Where does the dividing line occur? Are we transgressing Inland Revenue
rules?
It is impossible to say where the dividing line falls - or, to be precise,
only the courts can say where it falls in any particular case, having regard
to all the evidence. As we have explained in replies over the past four
years or so, the anti-avoidance provisions of (inter alia) section 674A of
the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 are widely drawn.
On the other hand, the Revenue makes it clear - in, for example, the free
booklet IR83 (Independent taxation: a guide for tax practitioners)  - that,
in practice, it does not always follow the rules laid down by parliament in
1989 to stop married couples entering into tax-avoidance arrangements.
If you have not yet seen a copy, we suggest that you ask your tax office for
the free booklet IR83. After reading it, you and your wife must either each
make up your mind on whether you consider you are covered by the
extra-statutory concessions outlined in the booklet (bearing in mind the
general warning: 'A concession will not be given in any case where an
attempt is made to use it for tax avoidance'); or talk decide if you should
seek professional guidance through the tax minefield from a local accountant
or solicitor.
A third course of action would be for each of you to make a complete
disclosure of the facts to your respective tax inspectors - and then wait to
see if retrospective assessments are made (carrying interest and penalties
for late disclosure of liabilities under section 674A etc.).

FT  10 JUL 93 / Finance and the Family: How Fidelity bounced back - In the
first of a new series, Philip Coggan looks at a fund with aggressive
instincts - Unit Trusts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FIDELITY Special Situations was one of the first four funds launched by the
US fund management group when it moved into Britain in 1989.
Anthony Bolton, who has managed the trust from the start, says it is run as
an aggressive fund, prepared to invest in companies in which other people
are not interested. The concentration tends, accordingly, to be on the
less-analysed, medium-sized and small company stocks, with only 5-10 per
cent of the fund in the FT-SE 100 index.
This can lead the fund into trouble during recessions when, for safety
reasons, investors favour the more heavily-traded big capitalisation stocks.
As the graph shows, the trust performed poorly over the period from late
1989 to September 1992. Investors who bought at the 1989 peak waited 3 1/2
years before they got their money back.
Part of the problem, admits Bolton, was that the portfolio contained too
many disasters  - stocks where the investment was lost totally, such as
Parkfield, Davies &amp; Newman or Babcock Prebon. But he adds that some of the
companies which he backed steadfastly through the recession, participating
in rescue rights issues, have turned up trumps in the past nine months. Tie
Rack, for example, has risen nearly sixfold from its low.
Since the pound's exit from the European exchange rate mechanism, the bid
price has risen more than 70 per cent. That places the fund second in the UK
equity growth sector over the year to July 1, with growth of 37.3 per cent
(offer-to-bid with income re-invested, according to Micropal). The only fund
ahead of Special Situations over that period is Fidelity's Recovery trust.
The relative performance of Special Situations over 10 years is also very
strong. It is third out of 50 funds over the period, with growth of 484.9
per cent. Over five years, it is 23rd out of 115 in the sector, reflecting
an increase of 59.8 per cent. It is only over the three-year period, where
the ranking slips to 63rd of 136, that the relative performance looks
unimpressive.
Bolton says that people tended to opt for Fidelity's American fund in the
early years because of the group's US origins. It took time to build up a
record in the UK. The strong growth achieved by the fund in the mid-1980s
helped turn it into one of the largest in the sector and, by last month, it
had grown to a healthy Pounds 345m.
Bolton feels that is too large to be run by one man, and he relies on a
dozen analysts who between them follow every stock in the fund. The
portfolio owns 104 companies and adheres to a strict stock-picking approach,
leading to an eclectic choice of companies.
The largest holding is in WPP, the advertising group run by Martin Sorrel
which over-reached itself by aggressive expansion in the 1980s. Bolton says
the company, having survived two financial reconstructions, should benefit
from a consumer-led recovery, although he is reducing his stake after a good
run for the shares over the past year.
The second largest stake is in VSEL, the submarine group. Bolton explains:
'There is a hole in the order book after 1997 which makes many people
nervous, but the company is piling up cash.' His next-largest holding is in
News International, Rupert Murdoch's UK publishing company.
Other large holdings include recovery plays such as Mirror Group and Wickes
and Burton, and 'undervalued situations' such as St James's Place Capital
and Security Services  - where Bolton believes the market has not recognised
the value of stakes in, respectively, J. Rothschild Assurance and Cellnet.
Bolton also has a substantial stake in Granada, where he has high hopes for
the group's interest in the satellite TV station BSkyB.
The trust is run with the aim of capital growth, which means Bolton has no
dividend yield constraints on his investment policy. Only accumulation units
are on offer, so this is not a fund for income-seekers.
Charges
The initial charge on the units is 5.25 per cent and the bid-offer spread on
July 6 was around 6 per cent. The annual charge is 1.5 per cent. The minimum
investment is Pounds 1,000.
On the savings scheme, the minimum monthly investment is Pounds 50. There is
a 1 per cent reduction in the initial charge for those who continue to save
for two years.
Anyone who invests Pounds 100 or more a month gets 1 per cent off the
initial charge immediately, and a further 1 per cent discount after two
years.
Special Situations qualifies for a Pep. Fidelity has a low initial Pep
charge of 2 per cent, but it does impose exit fees on those who sell during
the first three years. The exit fee is 3 per cent in year one, 2 per cent in
year two and 1 per cent in year three. Accordingly, those who hold their
investment for three years will see lower charges inside a Pep than outside
it.

<TEXT>
AN ELEMENT of uncertainty has surrounded quoted nursing home companies
because of proposed changes in community care funding. But this has not
stopped Quality Care Homes from producing a very strong share price
performance since its stock market debut last July. Duncan Bannatyne,
managing director, has now sold 300,000 at 265p just after announcing
interim results which showed a healthy increase in earnings over last year.
But he retains more than 9m.
Directors in Control Techniques have a history of deft timing when trading
in their own shares. Clement Wheatley, chairman, bought 72,000 at just under
Pounds 2 in March last year while his colleague, Professor Pat McKeown, a
non-executive director, bought 4,000 at much the same price some six months
later. Neither has yet decided to take his profit but managing director
Kevin Curran has chosen this moment to sell 100,000 at 337p.
The shares have virtually doubled over the past seven months, and even over
a 12-month period they have outperformed the market by approximately 35 per
cent. When interim results were announced at the start of June, the chairman
revealed that overall order bookings were up 20 per cent compared with the
same period last year.
We rarely record open market purchases by directors in Marks &amp; Spencer, but
this week is an exception. Philip McCraken bought 10,000 at 345p.

FT  10 JUL 93 / Finance and the Family: Holiday homes alarm insurers -
Bethan Hutton explains why getting cover for your country cottage can be so
difficult
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOUSEHOLD insurance premiums can vary so widely that it is best to get as
many quotes as you can. Unfortunately, when it comes to a second home, that
approach rarely is possible: most of the big insurers will not even consider
covering a holiday home unless your main residence is also insured with
them. They may even insist on getting both buildings and contents business
from you before agreeing to take on the second address.
Their reluctance is based on experience that unoccupied homes are a higher
risk, and not just from burglaries. Most claims arise from water damage,
whether from burst pipes or storms. An unnoticed burst pipe can cause havoc
while a missing tile can let through a lot of water before it is spotted.
For this reason, most insurers impose stringent conditions. They usually
demand either that the water system is drained if you leave the property for
more than 24 or 48 hours, or ask you to leave the heating on. Most also
require that a neighbour or agent should check the property regularly.
Insurers have long memories when it comes to assessing risks. Isolated
cottages in north Wales still make some underwriters nervous, even though
several years have passed since the last one was burnt down. Most companies
say they will look at each case on its merits but, by and large, a cottage
in Wales will cost more to insure than one in Cornwall.
Some insurers - Royal Insurance and General Accident are two - charge the
same for a particular area whether a house is a main or holiday home, but
cover for the latter is likely to be restricted. Personal effects and
valuables are a common exclusion - it is assumed you will not keep a
collection of Ming china in your Highland croft - and any jewellery you take
along to dazzle the locals will be covered under an all-risks clause in your
main house policy. Some companies also exclude accidental damage, and offer
only indemnity rather than new-for-old cover.
Other insurers load the premiums for second homes to compensate for the
increased risk. Norwich Union adds 50 per cent while Eagle Star charges 10
per cent more for buildings and 17.5 for contents. Guardian Royal Exchange
loads contents premiums by 100 per cent, but charges the normal rate for
building cover. Be warned, though: higher premiums do not necessarily mean
that cover is as comprehensive as your main household insurance.
Only a handful of companies offer stand-alone policies designed specifically
for second homes. One is the Andrew Copeland group (081-656 8435), which
deals with both UK and foreign holiday homes, whether private or used for
letting. It can quote immediately for properties in the UK, France, Spain,
Portugal, Cyprus, the Balearics, Canaries, Malta, Greece, Italy and Ireland.
Standard cover abroad costs Pounds 2.50 per Pounds 1,000 for buildings, and
Pounds 6.25 for contents; the UK equivalent is Pounds 2.75 and Pounds 3.
Homes in other countries are referred to underwriters for a quote.
Another specialist is Holiday Homes Insurance Services (0708-730 236). Its
policies, underwritten by London &amp; Edinburgh and sold direct or through
brokers, can cover second homes in the UK, France, Spain, Italy, Greece,
Portugal and Malta. Building cover costs Pounds 2.75 per Pounds 1,000 abroad
and Pounds 3 in the UK; contents are Pounds 6 per Pounds 1,000 abroad and
Pounds 6.60 in the UK. One of its specialities is providing cover in the UK
for chalet-style wooden holiday homes, which most insurers reject.
Florida is increasing popular for second homes but UK insurers generally are
reluctant to offer cover there or anywhere else in the US. This is because
the public liability cover standard on European policies is unlikely to be
enough to cope with the huge damages awards made by American courts. Owners
of second homes there usually are recommended to take out insurance locally.
Few of the large UK insurance companies will themselves insure holiday homes
abroad but many have subsidiaries or associate companies in European
countries - and sometimes elsewhere - to which they can direct customers.
One benefit is that local insurers may prove cheaper and speedier at dealing
with claims, and will provide policies adapted better to regulations and
conditions on the spot.
Subsidiaries of UK insurers may also have the advantage of offering an
English language service, which could be a comfort for Tuscan villa-owners
whose Italian can cope better with menus than the small print of policies
and claim forms.
Allowing friends and relatives to use your holiday home presents few
problems - some insurers even welcome it, seeing any increase in occupancy
as reducing the risk - but renting it, whether occasionally or regularly, is
a complication from the company's point of view. It is important to let it
know if you are planning to let the property; otherwise, any claims could be
rejected.
If you let only occasionally, and on a fairly non-commercial basis (say, to
work colleagues or friends of friends), the company might be willing to
cover you, but it will exclude accidental damage and theft except where
there is evidence of forced entry. If you rent the house regularly to
strangers, you will have to switch to a commercial policy rather than
standard household insurance.

FT  10 JUL 93 / Diary of a Private Investor: Reality - or just wishful
thinking?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN GOLDSTEIN-JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANY IN the financial world believe that share prices are based partly on
perceptions of companies' future performance. If so, then a number of City
people must be expecting a major turnaround in the property market.
Shares in several property companies have soared this year. Shaftesbury is
up from 39p to 94p, Clayform from 10p to 38p and Anglo St James from 8p to
15p. Even Dares Estates has risen from 1.25p to 2.5p.
I missed out on all these rises. Why? Because, from walking around city
centres, I could not believe the property market was about to stage a
dramatic recovery.
I continue to see lots of empty office blocks. Many of them have been unlet
since they were built several years ago. High streets and a number of
shopping centres still have many vacant and boarded-up shops.
Several million people live in homes worth less than their purchase price.
With negative equity, fewer people can afford to trade up to larger
properties.
According to the spring/summer issue of Savills' magazine, a very good
five-bedroom freehold house in Fulham, west London, which could have cost
upwards of Pounds 500,000 in 1989, can now be found at a price starting from
Pounds 350,000. In Hampshire, a three-bedroomed detached cottage which might
have fetched Pounds 115,000 as recently as September 1992 could be bought in
April this year for Pounds 97,000. I am sure the market for large country
homes will become even more depressed because of the financial problems
facing many members of Lloyd's.
Even reading the company reports of non-property companies shows how far
some prices have fallen. My personal pension scheme has a small shareholding
in Zetters, the football pools operator. In his August 1992 statement to
shareholders, chairman Paul Zetter pointed out that two essential London
properties owned by the company had been re-valued in December 1988 at
Pounds 5.5m 'when UK property values were at their peak.'
He went on: 'However, since then, current rentals have halved.' And he
revealed that the market value at March 31 1992 had been estimated at Pounds
1.425m by the company's agent, Chestertons.
For me, one of the attractions of Zetters has been its cautious accounting
approach. Having commissioned the re-valuation, the company incorporated it
into its accounts, even though it meant a drop in value of more than Pounds
4m.
With writedowns like these, why do purely property companies, with no other
sources of income apart from rents and property sales, show such a surge in
their share prices? Are we about to see a repeat of 1973-74? Are the sharp
rises based on reality or wishful thinking?
A local newspaper where I live in Poole, Dorset, revealed recently that
Bournemouth-based McCarthy &amp; Stone had paid doctors and solicitors to
provide 'leads' to people who would buy its purpose-built retirement flats.
The company said it wished to extend this incentive to milkmen and others in
contact with likely purchasers.
Many other developers have introduced a variety of incentives to people to
rent or buy their properties. But I still feel that, in a large number of
cases, prices remain too high.
A recent report by McKinsey &amp; Co showed that prime retail selling space cost
two-thirds more in the UK than in the US. True, there are only a limited
number of sites available in Britain for massive superstores, but why should
average high street properties cost so much?
Why are so many properties still empty? Is it partly because some landlords
continue to ask unrealistic rents? Are they doing this to satisfy banks
which lent them money based on a multiple of the anticipated rent roll, and
are unwilling to admit that the property is worth less than the sums secured
against it?
Of course, I am disappointed I missed out on the excellent profits I could
have made had I bought property shares in January. But I sold my last
property share in 1989 and have not been tempted back into the sector.
I will continue to avoid such shares in the short term for fear of a
collapse. I feel property shares have risen too high, too fast, and that
there could be a sharp correction. But I will continue to seek out those
non-property companies which run profitable manufacturing and other
businesses but have real estate worth more than the value incorporated in
their accounts.
A good example is Treatt, in which my personal pension scheme bought shares
for 113p in January 1992. The balance sheet for the year to September 1992
showed the market value of the company's freehold property to be Pounds
227,179, but the statement with the accounts said the directors considered
the real figure to be 'in excess of this value.'
Treatt shares are now 163p, due to their excellent trading performance in
supplying and manufacturing essential oils and aromatic chemicals for the
flavour and fragrance industries. I prefer a company like Treatt, with a
sound business - plus lowly-valued property - to a purely property-based
company.
