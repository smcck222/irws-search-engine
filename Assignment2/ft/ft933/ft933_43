FT  10 JUL 93 / Finance and the Family: So silly not to make a will
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARBARA ELLIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PROPOSED changes to the intestacy laws announced by the lord chancellor,
Lord Mackay, should be a powerful incentive to avoid dying without a will,
or intestate. Although the changes, implementing most of the recommendations
made by the Law Commission, improve the position of surviving partners, not
all can become law at once. Anomalies may arise during the transition.
Mackay said the government wanted to enable most surviving spouses to stay
in the matrimonial home with enough to live on - size of estate permitting.
As more than 90 per cent of people dying without wills in England and Wales
leave less than Pounds 125,000 net, he is to make an order 'as soon as
practicable' increasing from Pounds 75,000 to Pounds 125,000 the statutory
legacy (or fixed net amount) to be paid to a surviving spouse with children,
and from Pounds 125,000 to Pounds 200,000 the amount going to survivors
without children.
The government chose to make these increases rather than accept the
commission's recommendation that a surviving spouse should always receive
the entire estate left by someone dying intestate, as this might have been
unfair to children from a previous marriage.
Other changes which will have to wait for parliamentary time are the
abolition of a provision known as the 'hotch-pot' rule; the introduction of
a 14-day survivorship clause; and increased discretion for the courts in the
treatment of unmarried people living together.
The hotch-pot rule affects very few estates but lays down that, in certain
circumstances, children wishing to inherit must bring into account any money
or property paid to them, or settled for their benefit, by the person who
has died intestate. This can mean that amounts received up to seven years
before have to count against any pay-out due from the estate.
The survivorship clause to be included in the intestacy rules will provide
that surviving wives or husbands will inherit only if they outlive their
partner by at least 14 days. Under the present rules, if a husband and wife
die simultaneously or within a short time of each other, the younger is
treated as having died first. (If the couple had wills, the older partner
would be assumed to have died first.)
'The reason is to preserve the estates for the respective families,' said
Pauline Walker, a solicitor specialising in family law with Manches &amp; Co.
'Saying that the younger died first in effect ignores that estate.'
So a younger wife who survives her husband by fewer than 14 days will be
deemed to have died before him. Walker added that the change on survivorship
would also cut down on administration costs, but saw no obvious explanation
for the choice of 14 days given that, in most wills, the survivorship clause
covers 30 days.
Unmarried partners will still have to go to court if they are to receive
anything from the estate of the person they were living with. But instead of
having to prove complete dependence, they will be able to apply for
'reasonable financial provision,' meaning reasonable for their maintenance.
With a spouse, the same words would have a wider meaning: reasonable in all
the circumstances whether or not required for maintenance.
The commission rejected the idea of any automatic provision for unmarried
co-habitees. 'The general feeling was if you are not prepared to take on the
burdens of marriage, it did not seem right you should reap the benefits,'
said Walker, describing the proposed changes as a nod towards co-habitees.
The new rules will give the courts wider discretion in deciding how much of
an estate an unmarried partner should receive. In particular, they will be
allowed to take into account such factors as the age of the person applying
for a share of the estate, how long they have been living with their late
partner, and what contribution each had made to the household.
Claims from unmarried partners will remain subject heavily to the discretion
of the courts, with decisions based on past cases as well as the modified
rules.
'The advice has to be - make a will,' said Walker. 'If you don't, you are
going to leave an unholy mess.' As an example, she said that if a married
man had been maintaining another woman and died without a will, the other
woman could claim against the estate. At the same time, the wife could apply
for more than the statutory provision.
Walker added: 'If you make a will there can be disputes, but this is less
likely provided it is not totally off the wall with outrageous provisions
cutting out dependents. If you take advice, it won't be. It will stand up.'

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Results due Tomkins, the conglomerate, is expected to report profits of
Pounds 174m and earnings of 13.5p in the year to May on Monday. This
compares with Pounds 132.1m and 12.7p of earnings the previous year. Growth
is expected to have been driven by a stronger performance in the US and will
for the first time include profits from Ranks Hovis McDougall, the milling
and baking group it bought last year.
MFI, the furniture group, is expected to report a fall in pre-tax profits on
Monday to about Pounds 43m, from Pounds 66.1m last year. Analysts downgraded
their profits forecasts at the half-year results in January, when MFI said
trading had declined sharply after Black Wednesday damaged consumer
confidence.
It also said sales had been down year-on-year in the first five weeks of its
ten-week new year sale, which usually accounts for about 30 per cent of
annual turnover.
The Rank Organisation announces half-year results on Thursday, with pre-tax
profits expected to be at or below last year's Pounds 94m. Some forecasts
are as low as Pounds 82m, based on a poorer performance from Rank Xerox.
The first half is not a good guide to the performance of Rank's
directly-managed businesses - such as holidays, video duplication and bingo
 -where profits tend to come in the second six months. More eagerly awaited
will be statements on current trading. Few expect anything definitive on the
group's future relationship with Rank Xerox.
Great Universal Stores, the UK's largest mail order company, which reports
on Thursday, is forecast to increase pre-tax profits from Pounds 441.5m to
between Pounds 465m and Pounds 470m. The dividend is expected to rise from
40p to 43p.
Analysts believe the company will have benefited from a increase in mail
order buying, while its market share continues to rise.

FT  10 JUL 93 / Finance and the Family: Latest annuity rates
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ANNUITY RATES have been falling, with cuts from Generali, Prudential, Royal
life and London Life over the past few weeks. Peter Quinton, of the Annuity
Bureau, says: 'These rates are linked to long-term interest rates, and it is
these rates which determine the rates insurance companies pay.
'The average gross redemption yield on the British government high coupon
15-year stock has fallen from 8.56 per cent on June 16 to 8.2 on July 6,
which compares with approximately 9.06 per cent for the same period last
year.'
Billy Burrows, of the London-based Annuity Direct, adds: 'Many people are
holding back from buying annuities because they expect that gilt yields will
rise as future expectations of inflation increase.
'However, there is room for yields to fall even further, as the fear of
inflation is being talked down and, with the strength of sterling, foreign
investors are being encouraged back into the market.'
The figures in the table above were provided by the Annuity Bureau,
Enterprise House, 59-65 Upper Ground, London SE1 9PQ. Telephone 071-620

FT  10 JUL 93 / Finance and the Family: BES gets a Footsie link
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT WAS only a matter of time before the fashion for linking returns to the
stock market should reach the business expansion scheme. Sponsors had been
talking about the idea for some time but, this week, Close Brothers was the
first to launch a BES linked to the FT-SE 100 index. Like many of the recent
issues, it is an assured tenancy scheme providing university accomodation.
BESSA Christ's College Companies gives investors a choice of two companies
in which to invest. The first offers a fixed price after five years of 115p
for every 100p invested; this equates to a return of 12.8 per cent a year to
a higher-rate taxpayer and 8.5 per cent to a lower rate-payer. The return is
backed by cash deposits.
The second will give a fixed return of 60p for each 100p invested after five
years - the original net investment for a higher-rate taxpayer - with a
variable return which depends on a rise in the FT-SE 100 index up to June
1998. Investors can divide their money between the two companies.
Is it a good idea to choose the stock market option? The fixed return is not
as competitive as similar BES assured tenancies schemes, and Close Brothers
says the main attraction is the stock market link.
Investors will be paid 1.85p for every 1 per cent rise in the Footsie
between July 30 and June 29 1998, so the index would have to rise by at
least 30 per cent over that period to better the fixed price.
The average annual rise in the Footsie in the five years to July 8 was 8.7
per cent, and 11.7 per cent on a 10-year scale, so this past performance
would exceed the 30 per cent rise. Gains are tax-free - but this is also
true of shares held within a personal equity plan.
What if the Footsie were to slide just before June 29 1998? The sponsors
will take an average of the index for the previous 10 days, but that is the
limit of your protection.
Other issues this week include:
Aegis III, a buy-back scheme sponsored by Matrix Securities which plans to
raise Pounds 9m for accomodation for Coventry University. The exit price is
118p after five years. Bank of Scotland is acting as guarantor up to a
maximum of Pounds 11m.
Lancaster University Residences III, sponsored by Noble &amp; Co., plans to
raise Pounds 3.5m for residential accommodation. The contracted exit price
is 120p and the scheme carries a guarantee from the Royal Bank of Scotland.
The Enlightened Tobacco Company, sponsored by Nabarro Wells, is a cigarette
company dedicated to truthful tobacco marketing.
The company is selling a new brand of cigarettes called 'Death' which
carries a skull and crossbones against a black background on the packet.
This is a highly speculative investment.

FT  10 JUL 93 / Finance and the Family: Where to get the most for your money
 -Worried about falling interest rates and lower income? / A look at the
options for the best return on your capital
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GENERATING income has become a tough business for those who rely on their
savings. The era of low interest rates might be good for borrowers but the
effect of the drop in base rates from 15 per cent in 1990 to 6 per cent now
has battered savers' incomes.
While they can take some comfort from the fall in inflation they are still
having to pay more for goods and services out of less income.
The prospect of a further base rate cut this year will shrink their savings
pot further.
The easiest (and safest) way to earn income from 1988-92, when base rates
were 10 per cent or more, was to leave money in a high-interest account at a
reputable bank or building society.
But savers in search of high income now have to work harder and take more
risk for lower returns.
Financial institutions have produced a succession of ever more complicated
high-income packages.
The main danger for investors is that they may not know all the risks
involved, particularly that capital may be eroded to provide income.
Broadly, the choice is between deposits, bonds and equity-based products.
You can also choose between fixed or variable rates.
While the former give protection against a further drop in rates, usually
they do not offer the highest returns and mean that investors lose out if
interest rates rise.
If you want monthly income, the choice is more limited, and the rates
usually are lower than for annual rates.
CASH-BASED DEPOSITS
Bank and building society accounts
These are convenient but, to get the highest rates, you need a minimum of at
least Pounds 10,000. The highest rates are shown in the table provided by
Moneyfacts on page VI; this includes a section on monthly rates. Postal
accounts usually offer the highest interest rates. Bradford &amp; Bingley's
Direct Notice postal account will pay 7.5 per cent gross on a Pounds 10,000
minimum and 7.75 per cent on Pounds 25,000 and above.
Chelsea building society is promising to hold the rate of 9 per cent gross
(or 8.65 monthly) until October 1 on a minimum deposit of Pounds 10,000 in
its Premier VIII account. The money must be left in until September 30 1995,
although withdrawals are allowed subject to 30 days' notice and a penalty of
45 days' interest.
Offshore accounts
These offer income gross, which is useful for non-taxpayers, and often pay
rates which are fractionally higher than those onshore. Taxpayers usually
can delay payment of tax. On a minimum of Pounds 10,000, Woolwich
International (Guernsey) will pay 6.5 per cent gross compared with 5.6 per
cent gross on its onshore Prime Gold account; both offer instant access.
Cash unit trusts
These invest in the money markets, where money is bought and sold for short
periods by institutions and rates change daily. Yields are quoted net of
charges. The main advantage is that a higher rate is paid on a lower minimum
than can easily be found at bank or building societies. Speed of access is
similar to a postal account.
Fidelity's cash trust has a yield of 5.4 per cent gross on a minimum of
Pounds 1,000; the yield on a Pounds 2,000 minimum minimum on Govett's MIS
cash fund is 5.1 per cent gross. Prudential's Cash Haven yields 4.7 per cent
gross on a minimum of Pounds 1,000. There is a chequebook attached to the
Fidelity trust for those who keep a balance of Pounds 5,000 (cheques must be
for a minimum of Pounds 250). Non-taxpayers should be aware that income is
paid net, so tax has to be reclaimed.
National Savings
NS income bonds pay monthly interest at a variable rate, now 7 per cent
gross. The minimum purchase is Pounds 2,000 up to a maximum holding of
Pounds 50,000.
You will need to give at least three months' notice to cash them and only
half the rate of interest will be paid on a bond cashed in the first year.
BONDS
Gilts
These IOUs issued by the government offer a fixed return for a set period.
They can be bought through the National Savings stock register at post
offices and income is usually paid twice a year. There is no capital risk to
an investor who buys a newly-issued gilt and holds it to maturity, but gilts
are tradeable and you might not be able to match the price you paid when you
sell.
Many are trading above face value, so you would make a capital loss if you
held them until maturity. Gilts are exempt from CGT but you will will not be
able to offset any capital losses against gains elsewhere. Redemption yields
vary between 5.1 per cent at the short end to 8.2 per cent at the long.
Bond funds
Many investors may prefer to buy gilts through a bond fund to take the worry
out of buying the right gilt at the right time. Bond funds are unit trusts
investing in gilts and other fixed-interest securities. But if a fund has a
very high yield, it is likely to be eating up the capital. CGT can be
charged on profits from bond funds, unlike gilts bought directly.
You will have to pay for the service, although some funds have been cutting
the initial charge of 5-6 per cent. The annual management fee is in the
region of 1 per cent.
The fund with the highest yield at the beginning of July was Eagle Star's UK
Preference &amp; Fixed Interest trust (8.8 per cent gross), but it was ranked 51
out of 55 for one-year performance, according to Micropal. The largest fund,
Barclays Unicorn Gilt &amp; Fixed Interest trust, with an 8.2 per cent gross
yield, was ranked 13 over the year to July 1.
International bond funds offer more choice of investments and have the
additional element of currency plays (which also makes them riskier than UK
bond funds), but yields are lower than for UK funds. Perpetual's Global fund
is top of its sector over the year to July 1 with a yield of 6.2 per cent
gross, according to Micropal.
Offshore bond funds are similar to international bonds funds but are based
outside the UK. They pay income gross and this can be rolled up for tax
planning purposes.
Permanent interest
bearing shares
Despite their name, these fixed-interest instruments are more like bonds
than shares, since they are issued by building societies to raise capital.
They carry no redemption date, so investors must sell them to get their cash
and thus will receive the prevailing market price. The greater risk of
buying a bond from a building society rather than the government is
reflected in their relative high yields. These are between 9.5 per cent
gross for Halifax (Pounds 50,000 minimum investment) to 10.96 per cent for
First National. Interest is paid twice yearly net of basic-rate tax and
gains are not liable to CGT (unless held in a collective fund).
EQUITY INVESTMENTS
Unit and investment trusts
The yield on the FT All-Share is around 4 per cent gross but collective
funds can offer much higher yields.
Split capital investment trusts divide the capital growth and income of the
trust between different classes of shares. In March, Schroder launched its
Split fund with an 8 per cent gross yield on the income shares after
charges. Take advice before investing in income shares because there are
different types.
In February, Hypo Foreign &amp; Colonial launched a unit trust with an
eye-catching yield of 10 per cent a year after charges. The Higher Income
plan uses options to earn a higher income, but at the expense of capital
growth.
Guaranteed equity bonds
Three new products offer high income but the risk again is of capital
erosion. Life Association of Scotland offers 10.1 per cent net, paid
quarterly for five years; Save &amp; Prosper's High Income bond promises a
guaranteed income of either 8 per cent net or 10 per cent net;, while Acuma,
the financial planning arm of American Express, has a choice of rates on its
Fixed High Income bond of 10, 9 and 7.5 per cent.
You will be paid back a proportion of your original investment after five
years but, in order for the whole amount to be returned, the stock market
will have had to have rise by a defined amount.
Annuities
The aim is to convert capital into income, but with some interest on top.
You pay a life office or friendly society a fixed sum in return for regular
monthly payments for the rest of your life (or for a fixed period in the
case of a temporary annuity). The amounts paid depend on your sex and age.
In general, annuities offer better value the older you are and the longer
you live, since any capital which is left on your death will be kept by the
life office. Annuity rates have been falling - see page IV.
Guaranteed income bonds
You pay a lump sum to a life office and get a fixed income for a specified
period. At the end of the period, your capital is returned to you. Rates
paid depend on the amount invested and the length of time the capital is to
be tied up, as the Highest Rates table on page VI shows.

FT  10 JUL 93 / Finance and the Family: What the experts think -
Scheherazade Daneshkhu seeks guidance from three advisors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WE ASKED three independent financial advisers for their choice of
investments to produce income. All emphasised the need to spread risk
through a well-balanced portfolio of equities, deposits and bonds.
RICHARD BOYTON, of Boyton Financial Services: 'What investors must look for
is total return - that is, both income and capital growth.' For a single,
basic-rate taxpayer, he suggests buying National Savings income bonds and
investing in an international bond fund: 'Both GT and Baring are based in
Ireland, pay their dividends gross, and are well-managed.'
Many people do not make use of their annual capital gains tax allowance, now
Pounds 5,800. Recently, Ivory &amp; Sime launched its ISIS investment trust with
the aim of providing income by exploiting the CGT But Boyton is unimpressed
by this and similar high-income packaged products: 'I'm not so sure these
products are without risk.'
He prefers zero coupon preference shares in a split-capital investment trust
to take advantage of the CGT allowance. As their name suggests, these do not
pay income. All the return from a zero comes as capital growth, which is
taxed as capital gain. His choice is Exeter Zero Dividend preference fund.
Boyton says the investments so far should account for 49 per cent of the
portfolio. Another 3 per cent should be held in cash and the remainder
placed in equities, where he suggests the following investment trusts:
Alliance, Electric &amp; General, Foreign &amp; Colonial, Murray International and
TR Far East: 'All have an impeccable reputation and the expectation of an
increasing income stream together with capital growth.' Finally, for
exposure to capital growth over a five-year period, Boyton likes Murray
Smaller Markets.
TONY SHEPHERD, of Shepherd Associates, believes people must accept they
cannot get the same level of income as before. He also believes packaged
high-income or guaranteed products are unnecessary so long as the portfolio
is structured well.
Taking a retired married couple as a sample, he would place 41 per cent in
cash and fixed interest with the balance in longer-term equities. Twelve per
cent would be in a tax-exempt special savings account (which pays tax-free
interest after five years on a staggered total investment of Pounds 9,000),
cash on deposit in a bank, and in Fidelity's cash unit trust. The National
Savings element is the index-linked sixth issue, which pays 3.25 per cent
tax-free above the rate of inflation.
Another 29 per cent is in bonds and gilts. Shepherd chooses Fidelity's Gilt
and Fixed Interest UK bond fund and the international bond funds of
Kleinwort Benson and Baring. The gilts are Conversion 9 per cent 2000 and
Treasury index-linked 2 per cent 2006. 'These low risk investments are
designed to provide a balance of liquidity, inflation protection and some
prospects of capital return.'
The equity side of the portfolio aims to provide long-term security through
capital growth. For UK exposure, Shepherd likes the income funds of James
Capel, M &amp; G and Schroder. The funds invested in Europe would be Lazard's
European Growth, M &amp; G European Dividend and Morgan Grenfell European
Growth, with Fidelity's Controlled Risk America fund for the US. Finally,
the Far East funds would be Save &amp; Prosper's South East Asia, James Capel's
Japan Growth, and Schroder's Tokyo.
DAVID HARRIS, of Chantrey Vellacott, is no fan of high-income packaged
products, but he does favour the income shares of Johnson Fry's Utilities
trust with a yield of 9 per cent. Traditionally, utilities have paid high
dividends and some fund managers are using this as the basis for a
high-income fund. Harris regards Cazenove's Utility and Bond fund, which is
packaged within a Pep, as good value.
With interest rates low, he does not think this is the time to buy annuities
or guaranteed income bonds. Instead, he prefers Whittingdale's Gilt Income
fund and Fidelity's Gilt &amp; Fixed Interest, and thinks Pibs are a useful way
to boost income although their prices have been rising. He likes Britannia
and Bradford &amp; Bingley.

There are separate deadlines for the public offer (July 14) and the retail
tender (July 16). To add to the confusion, different share shops have
imposed their own deadlines.

post - 10 am July 12); Lloyds (branches - 3.30 July 12; post  - 5 pm July
13); Midland (branches - 3.30 July 12; post - 10 am July 13); NatWest (4.30
pm July 12).
Those who want large amounts of shares stand their best chance in the retail
tender.
The following brokers will accept new clients for the tender: Arnold Stansby

FT  10 JUL 93 / Finance and the Family: Some house price cheer - At a Glance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
While the general level of house prices fell 1.1 per cent in June, according
to the Halifax building society, there was some encouragement in a 0.3 per
cent rise in the price paid by first-time buyers. Such prices are still 5.3
per cent lower than they were in June 1992, however.
The average price paid by a first-time buyer in June was Pounds 45,465.
Halifax said: 'As demand for mortgage finance continues to rise, this will
feed through to a gradual rise in house prices. We expect prices to move on
to a more consistently rising trend in the first half of 1993.'

FT  10 JUL 93 / Finance and the Family: Gold price continues on its upward
path - At a Glance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Gold continued its push upwards but gains did not match those made last
week. The rise has been driven by New York investment fund activity and
started on June 30 after Sir James Goldsmith, the international financier,
announced he was to sell another big block of shares in Newmont Mining,
North America's largest gold producer, and buy gold bullion instead.
For a time, the price threatened Dollars 400 an ounce and closed on Thursday
night in London at Dollars 395. But bullion prices fell back last night,
closing at Dollars 392.75, and dealers were divided on whether the rally
will continue.

FT  10 JUL 93 / Markets: Grumpy or Happy? City looks for clues - London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALL HAS not been well in the square mile this week. The City of London has
been transformed into a besieged city.
Taxi drivers have become ever more grumpy as they attempt to dodge the
bollards to enter the enchanted circle. Workers whistling their way to
offices have found their roads blocked. It must be part of a complex plot by
the administrators of Canary Wharf to persuade banks and brokers to relocate
to docklands.
Perhaps it was the road blocks which caused turnover in the equity market to
fall this week, and the Footsie index to move into 'a consolidation phase',
the strategists term for going sideways.
Or possibly the start of a new half year has allowed fund managers to enter
a more sleepy phase, keeping their books - already dressed up for the end of
June valuations - prepared for the BT3 sale, the forthcoming interim results
season, and their holidays.
There has been little in the way of good UK economic news to shake them from
their dopey state. The seven wise men said the economic recovery would be
slow and patchy; car sales are strong but the housing market is stalling;
consumer credit figures were lower in May than they had been in April and
March; but the M0 measure of money supply is running above target.
The UK market seemed unimpressed too - at least initially - by the Tokyo
summit. A breakthrough on the Gatt talks, which promises lower tariffs and
increased world trade, should be welcome to all. But it took the US market's
rise on Thursday to demonstrate to London that this happy news might be
translated into higher share prices.
So it was Friday before the Footsie was showing a bashful rally just
regaining the week's opening level before lunch. But then a weaker Wall
Street opening had the market slipping again, to end the week 14.5 points
down at 2843.2.
This will not deter the bulls. The chart, which the boffins at Nomura
Research Institute dreamed up, shows how the FTA-All Share index rose over
the period from September 1979 to the end of 1982, and how the same index
has been moving since September 1990. The two periods cover roughly the same
parts of the recession and recovery cycle.
The two lines follow a remarkably similar pattern. If that continues, the
market has further to rise. But it will take some good news to prompt that.
There has been a revival of hopes of lower base rates, partly as the word
from Mount Fuji is that interest rates around the world need to fall
further. At BZW the strategists have revised their forecast for base rates
at the year end from 5 1/2 to 5 per cent, though they do not expect a cut
until the autumn. Its not much, but it helps.
Bulls are awaiting the results season, which kicks off towards the end of
this month, for positive news of how companies have performed in the first
two quarters of economic growth. If all goes well, earnings forecasts for
1993 should be underpinned or even raised as the season progresses.
Companies which do not match up to expectations will be severely punished,
as some found out this week.
All has not been well in the Magic Kingdom. Euro Disney warned on Thursday
that it would make a loss this summer, its second summer season since
opening the EuroDisneyland theme park near Paris. Its shares slumped 145p to
638p in London between the announcement on Thursday and Friday's close.
The concern is that Euro Disney's problems are not just a sneezy, summer
cold, but a bout of double pneumonia. Doc Walt Disney has been called in
from the US to administer a financial injection.
Euro Disney has had to shelve plans to expand the theme park, and is looking
at raising extra capital. All in all, those who wished on a star and
invested in the great European leisure complex will have to wait a long time
for their dreams to come true.
All has not been well, either, in the UK holiday industry. Owners Abroad,
the tour operator which squeaked a win against a hostile Pounds 294m bid
from Airtours four months ago, has discovered that its current year profits
will be about half the number the City was expecting.
A rapid downward revision of forecasts to around Pounds 11m, and the
departure of the chairman and the director in charge of tour operations, cut
the shares from 98 1/2 p to 66p on Thursday, although they rallied on Friday
to 72 1/2 p. The Takeover Panel was opening an investigation into some of
the things Owners was saying at the time of the bid.
There has been some good news though. Greycoat, the property group, has
found its fairy godmother in the unlikely shape of Alastair Ross Goobey, the
chief executive of Postel the largest pension fund in the UK. His fund has
underwritten a Pounds 120m rescue package, which underlines the rising
enthusiasm for commercial property.
Like Postel, 3i the venture capital fund, has money it is keen to invest. It
announced results this week showing pre-tax profits up 39 per cent to Pounds
56m in the year to March, despite some nasty provisions such as a Pounds 72m
write-off against its stake in Isosceles, the Gateway food retail group.
3i has been cashing in a number of earlier investments as management
buy-outs float on the stockmarket. Now it has nearly Pounds 1bn to invest,
but is lacking takers. That is another indication that economic recovery is
proving slow.
If 3i cannot find sufficient homes for its money, Granada, the leisure group
can. This week it took its stake in LWT, the London weekend television
station, to 20 per cent and opened discussions to see how the two companies
could help each other. Coming on top of other recent investments in the
sector, the market in television shares has been turned on.

FT  10 JUL 93 / Markets: Optional extras that bear watching - Serious Money
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FUTURES and options are creeping gradually into the main stream of personal
finance. More and more funds are being launched which use the products - for
example, bear funds, which allow investors to profit from a falling stock
market.
It is tempting to shy away from all these products because they seem either
too complicated or too speculative. But futures and options can also be used
for insurance. If you own BT shares, for example, you can buy a put option
giving you the right to sell at, say, 400p. If the BT share price falls to
300p, you exercise your put and sell the shares at 400p. You have 'insured'
against the risk of a sharp fall in the share price.
If you bought a put without owning BT shares at all, that would be
speculation. You would be gambling that the BT price would fall
substantially so that the option would increase sharply in value.
Of course, you have to pay for this right. The cost of an option, like an
insurance policy, is called a premium. A call option to buy BT shares at
420p in August now carries a premium of around 19p.
The existence of premiums creates another use for options; a way to get
extra income. This is the technique Hypo Foreign &amp; Colonial used to offer a
10 per cent income to investors. Its fund sells options to earn premiums,
which it then pays out to investors as income.
A new unit trust, from Shore Capital Stockbrokers and Providence Capitol,
uses similar strategies. Options will be sold against the trust's shares,
with the aim of generating option income of 10-15 per cent a year.
Rather than being paid out to investors, this will be accumulated as capital
gain (although a withdrawal plan allows those who want income to take out 10
per cent of their original capital each year).
Naturally, the option income has its price. By selling the option, the trust
has given outsiders the right to buy its shares. They will exercise those
options if share prices rise substantially. Accordingly, the trust will
underperform in a rising market.
If share prices generally were to fall, the trust's portfolio would decline.
The premium income would cushion the trust from part of the fall, but
investors would still lose money.
The trust would do best in a flat market, with shares barely moving. In such
circumstances, it would receive its premium income but buyers would not
exercise their options.
How should investors view all this? Common sense suggests that, if it is so
easy to earn 10-15 per cent a year in option premiums, everybody would be
doing it, especially if you can earn only 6 per cent from cash. Therefore,
this is either a market anomaly (which might close) or investors are taking
some risk in order to earn the extra reward.
One should note also the high charges on the fund, with the annual levy
being 2 per cent on top of the 5.25 per cent initial charge. These will,
inevitably, eat into investor returns. So, given the doubts, cautious
investors should wait to see if this concept works in practice. After a year
or so, it will be possible to assess the record rather than the theory.
                           *      *      *
A MORE conventional fund is on offer from Dunedin Fund Managers, namely, a
Japanese investment trust.
The Tokyo market certainly has bounced back from its 1992 lows, and those
who bought into Japan last summer have done very well indeed. The problem is
that the market there is very difficult to value.
Price-earnings ratios, the traditional measurement yardstick in the UK and
the US, are much higher in Japan - the Tokyo market's present p/e is 58,
according to Datastream. At 0.8 per cent, dividend yields are much lower
than in the Anglo-Saxon markets.
For a long time, those who doubted the Japanese market's ability to sustain
these stratospheric ratings were dismissed as naive by the cognoscenti.
Sceptics were told that 'traditional valuation methods don't apply in
Japan.' When the market fell from 38,000 to 14,000 over two years, the
sceptics could afford to feel smug.
Given that the Japanese government has played its part in encouraging the
recent stock market rebound, are we witnessing a 'sucker's rally' which will
prove to be short-lived?
Not according to Dunedin. It believes Japanese corporate earnings are due
for a substantial recovery, that interest rates are at exceptionally low
levels, and that international investors have underweight positions in
Japanese equities at present, and will wish to increase their holdings.
Dunedin has a good record in Tokyo; its Japan Smaller Companies and Japan
Growth unit trusts are, respectively, sixth and ninth in the sector over the
three years to July 1.
For private investors, Japan definitely remains a high-risk market. But
those who have decided already to opt for Tokyo might be tempted by
Dunedin's offer: 35 per cent of the manager's annual fee will be donated to
Barnardo's for the first five years of the trust's life.

FT  10 JUL 93 / Markets: A race that didn't take place - The Bottom Line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT WAS straight out of Alice in Wonderland. The starting pistol went. The
contestants raced around the track for all they were worth. They flashed
across the finishing line, the crowds roared.
But when it was all over, something very curious happened. All the
contestants denied that the event had taken place. Even the winner said he
had no knowledge of a race, and refused to accept the prize. Fortunately for
the crowd, the bookies honoured their bets, and many punters went home much
the richer.
The amazing non-race was staged by the 12 regional electricity companies in
England and Wales. Only two years after they were privatised, their annual
results season has become an unspoken contest in who can produce the biggest
dividend increase. And what a contest it was.
The clear winner was Southern Electric based outside Maidenhead which
recommended a total increase for the year of no less than 17.6 per cent. But
true to the rules of the non-contest, Geoffrey Wilson, the chairman, brushed
aside the plaudits. He said: 'We are not trying to be top of the pops.'
The average increase for all the RECs was 15.3 per cent, which means that
even the lowest increase, from Norweb, was still a handsome 13 per cent,
giving shareholders some of the best returns available in the market. (Ken
Harvey, Norweb's chairman, attacked the race as 'dreadful' and admitted that
Norweb had been preparing to pay out even less until it saw the way the rest
of the industry was going.)
Is it all too good to be true? How much longer can it go on?
The answer is probably for quite a while yet. For one thing the fundamentals
of the regional electricity sector look very good. The RECs were floated off
at prices which did not fully reflect the potential for cost savings, and
all of them are now busy carving out the fat. Thousands of jobs have been
shed in the last two years, and several thousand more are likely to go
between now and 1995. A typical REC has got its costs down by Pounds 20m a
year, with more to go.
Strong cash flow has also enabled the RECs to start paying off the
government debt with which they were saddled at flotation. South Wales
Electric, which now calls itself SWALEC, became the first REC to repay all
its debt earlier this year, and others will follow.
The RECs have also issued bullish dividend forecasts. Many have used words
like 'progressive real increases in dividends', some have even put specific
numbers on them, like Norweb which forecast rises of inflation plus 6-8 per
cent. The stock analysts agree. Nigel Hawkins, who follows the utilities at
Hoare Govett, is forecasting dividend increases of 12 per cent for the
current year, and 11 per cent the year after that. 'The dividends are safe
as houses for the next couple of years,' he says.
But there may be another factor: the attitude of the electricity regulator
Prof Stephen Littlechild. He takes the view that it is up to the RECs to
decide how much profit they want to pay out in dividends - provided they are
reinvesting enough to maintain technical and service standards. In other
words, he does not want to get involved. But the RECs are not entirely free
from regulatory threat. Prof. Littlechild can - and does - influence profits
by setting the price controls. Yesterday he announced a tougher price regime
for the RECs' electricity supply business.
Although this was a minor move affecting only 10 per cent of the REC's
operating profits, it is a forerunner of a much larger review which will
affect the other 90 per cent this time next year. So anyone holding REC
shares should note that next summer is a key date.
The key to individual RECs' success will be their ability to withstand a
cost squeeze. Analysts advise looking for those with strong financial
positions, like SWALEC and Southern, or those who have got their operating
costs below the average, like Seeboard and East Midlands. Nigel Burton of
Warburg Securities, said: 'What Prof Littlechild wants to see is efficient
companies.'

FT  10 JUL 93 / Markets: Skittish investors face season of uncertainty -
Wall Street
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SNOW IN the Rockies, floods in the mid-west and a record-breaking heat wave
in the east - summer this year is straying far from its norm. Coming on the
heels of an equally unpredictable winter, people just do not know what to
expect next.
The stock markets have been behaving in a similarly capricious fashion.
Since mid-June, share prices as measured by the Dow Jones Industrial Average
have moved so erratically that they have confounded attempts to draw up a
sensible analysis of market trends.
On midsummer's day, the Dow was at 3,510. In the two days following June 21,
it dropped 44 points, but rallied more than 60 points over the following
three days. It then embarked upon a five-day slide which took 80 points off
its value. On July 7 it rallied once more, recouping almost 65 points in two
days. By mid-morning yesterday, after more than a fortnight of wild
gyrations, the Dow was back where it started - at 3,510.
These swings in prices reflect investor skittishness over the outlook for
equities. The markets are proving extremely difficult to read, and no one
can make a forecast with any real confidence.
This uncertainty has been reflected in a series of recent articles in US
newspapers and financial magazines postulating various outcomes for the
markets over the rest of the year and beyond.
Persuasive cases have been made that investors should hang tough (prices
will remain trapped in a relatively narrow range as investors wait for the
economy to take a firmer direction); that they should buy more stocks (as
the economy's problems worsen, interest rates will fall even further and
attract more money into the markets, pushing up prices); and that they
should start selling stocks (interest rates will go up to head off
inflation, forcing money out of overpriced stocks and turning a controlled
decline into a headlong slide as nervous mutual fund investors scramble to
liquidate their holdings).
Uneasiness about the approaching second-quarter corporate reporting season
has only added to the indecisive mood. The run-up to the season has been
dominated by profits warnings from companies struggling to maintain earnings
growth achieved earlier in the year or late in 1992.
To some, the warnings suggest that second-quarter earnings across the board
will fall short of expectations. To others, however, the season offers hopes
for a rally, on the assumption that most of the bad news has been priced
into stocks already. A good example of this thinking occurred this week when
Nike announced fourth-quarter earnings of Dollars 76.9m, up from Dollars
70.7m a year ago.
Although profits were lower than analysts had expected, Nike's share price
rose Dollars 1.50 to Dollars 56 on the news, mainly because the stock had
been depressed ever since the sports shoe retailer issued a warning late in
June about its longer-term earnings outlook.
Several other factors have been behind the recent price oscillations.
Commodities prices continue to exert an influence on stock, and bond,
markets. The value of metals, especially gold, has been swinging back and
forth, while fears that the huge floods in the mid-west will wreck some of
the country's major crop harvests has boosted food prices temporarily.
Energy prices also have been playing havoc on stocks. Earlier this week,
shares in the country's airlines were hit by surging crude oil prices as
investors worried that the big carriers, already involved in the latest
skirmish of a long-running air fare war, would face higher fuel costs.
On Thursday, airline stocks rebounded as oil prices turned tail, but
yesterday they retreated once more, this time unsettled by reports of weak
June air travel numbers.
The manoeuvrings of the short-sellers - the speculative investors who,
anticipating a falling market, sell borrowed stock in the hope they can buy
it back later at a lower price - also have taken their toll. Much of
Thursday's 38-point gain in the Dow, for example, was attributed to demand
from short-sellers. They had expected prices to decline but, when the
markets started heading higher, they were forced to scramble to buy back
stock to meet their future obligations.
The short-sellers, in fact, have been taking quite a beating from the
markets. Since the beginning of the year, they have been betting that stocks
would make a decisive move downwards - but each time the markets have
teetered close to a collapse, buyers have stepped in and prices have snapped
back smartly.
Of course, at some stage the short-sellers are going to be proved right. The
problem is, no one, least of all the short-sellers themselves, has any clue
when that time will come.

FT  10 JUL 93 / The Long View: Pensions? That's rich]
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COULD THE government possibly be against motherhood, apple pie and pensions?
Well, pensions, anyway? When former chancellor Norman Lamont reduced the tax
credit on UK company dividends from 25 to 20 per cent in his March Budget,
the pensions industry was torn between pretending nothing had really
happened and pressing the panic button.
A deafening silence followed while the Society of Pension Consultants
calculated that the change would cost occupational pension funds some Pounds
500m in lost income, with holders of personal pension plans losing another
Pounds 100m.
Measured against the scale of total assets of the order of Pounds 500bn and
annual investment income of about Pounds 20bn, these are perhaps
insignificant sums in themselves. But the Treasury has begun to attack the
tax privileges of pension funds. Moreover, it has done it in a sneaky way,
pretending that its main objective was to help companies rather than raise
revenue.
Now, the pensions industry has decided that fire must be returned against
the snipers. A body with the catchy title of the Occupational Pension
Schemes Joint Working Group has protested that the tax structure for pension
schemes must be preserved. More broadly, the National Association of Pension
Funds has launched a campaign dubbed Pensions: Securing the Future, posing
the threat of a 'pensions under-class' as state pensions dwindle in size and
the coverage of occupational schemes becomes more patchy.
There is certainly a case for clearer thinking on pensions. The government
appears to have got into a muddle over its tax policies. On the one hand, it
expended enormous efforts and large amounts of money in the 1980s in
promoting personal pension plans (of which there are now 4.5m holders). But
now it is eroding the tax relief which has made such pension plans
attractive.
Interestingly, Peter Lilley, the social security secretary, added his own
angle to the pensions debate this week through his statistical document The
Growth of Social Security. His concern was to prevent the bill for social
security outstripping the nation's ability to pay. For the time being,
pensioners pose less of a problem than other groups dependent on state
support, such as single mothers. But as we move into the 21st century and
the demographic balance changes, the elderly may become more of a burden.
The basic case for state involvement in pensions is that if people become
destitute in old age, the state will have to sustain them, anyway, so it is
wise to arrange a long-term financial structure through which the retired
can be supported. This can be done either through pay-as-you-go systems, in
which contributions are recycled immediately to pensioners (which is how the
state scheme works), or by the build-up of occupational or personal funds.
A subsidiary argument here is that savings should, in any case, be
encouraged for various reasons. Yet, Inland Revenue-approved pension schemes
are, in many respects, poor ways of doing this because they lock people's
savings away for decades in remote funds and institutions of sometimes
dubious security; force them to take a certain type of income benefit; and
destroy the option of passing personal wealth on to the next generation.
In any case, the anti-destitution motive has become confused by the exploits
of the well-advised rich. Thus, we have the example of Sir Anthony Tennant,
retiring chairman of Guinness, taking legitimate advantage of tax reliefs to
collect a Pounds 500,000-plus annual pension. Should the government really
be supporting this kind of benefit level though tax concessions?
In fact, several years ago the government imposed a 'cap' on qualifying
incomes; this year, it has been frozen at Pounds 75,000 rather than rising
in line with inflation (Sir Anthony escaped this, as do all employees who
joined their schemes before 1989). This ceiling is surely too high; even so,
it has attracted great fury from pensions professionals, which shows the
extent to which pension regulations have become turned into a great
middle-class tax break rather than a solution to the problem of poverty in
old age.
The poor are always with us, but many retired people are now unusually
prosperous. Occupational pension schemes have been heavily in surplus, and
have been able to top-up pensions in line with inflation to a greater extent
than ever before. Many old people also benefited from the extraordinary
house price boom of the 1980s.
Between 1986 and 1991 inclusive, equity withdrawal (the extent to which new
mortgage lending exceeded physical investment in housing) averaged about
Pounds 14bn a year, according to the Joseph Rowntree Foundation's new
Housing Finance Review. Retired people will have received much of this. But
equity withdrawal collapsed to Pounds 3.5bn last year, and the housing
miracle cannot be worked again in the foreseeable future.
If we are to have a debate on retirement provision, my initial position
would be to say that we should preserve and improve basic state provision
and encourage a funded second tier up to twice average incomes. Beyond that,
people should be left to accumulate their own wealth. They could still be
given access to tax-sheltered investments like personal equity plans.
This is not the kind of emphasis that the NAPF itself would make, given that
it represents wealthy corporate schemes. Nor would it please the host of
consultants who make most of their living by selling tax-saving schemes to
executives in small private companies. But if the 'cap' were brought lower
down the income scale, it would still be possible for companies to offer
various other employee benefits should they wish to do so. As for pensions,
the arguments could be focused more accurately on the problems of the poor
rather than, as too often happens now, on the needs of the rich.

FT  10 JUL 93 / Riding the rails past the ruins of Russia: First it was the
nobility, then the party bosses. Today, western tourists are the
priviligentsia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTIAN TYLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ENSCONCED in their berths of polished mahogany and brass, lounging in the
bar, or snuffling up delicacies in one of three decorated dining cars, the
new priviligentsia stared out at the bleak Russian landscape. Towns and
villages presented the same derelict face: cracked apartment blocks and
crumbling factories, roads rutted and strewn with abandoned concrete piles
and coils of rusty wire. Only the painted wooden cottages inside their
picket fences revealed these places to be habitations of human beings.
At each halt, through windows locked shut for security, the travellers met
the gazes of the disinherited proletariat on the platform outside. Children
waved, the adults merely stared. Their stares conveyed nothing, neither
amusement, wonder nor resentment.
Once, it was the languid aristocracy who travelled like this, commuting
between their palaces in St Petersburg or Moscow and their country estates.
Then came the bureaucracy, the peasant-workers of the politburo, preaching
sacrifice in public but pampering themselves in private. Now, it is the turn
of the foreign capitalist plutocracy, bearing bundles of the only commodity
of value in Russia today: US dollars.
The Bolshoi Express is half a mile of luxurious rolling stock built during
the 1950s to trundle senior apparatchiks round the Soviet empire for their
urgent meeting-and-drinking engagements. Krushchev probably slept here. The
train has been assembled as a private joint venture by astute freelancing
servants of the Russian railway and a British tour operator.
Its itinerary could be described in various ways: as a romantic ride through
history, from St Petersburg on the Baltic to Tashkent in central Asia, from
one end of the tsars' empire to the other; or as an expensive way to smuggle
free-spending westerners safely through a collapsing country.
On the second night in St Petersburg, passengers on the inaugural run were
bussed (no walking after dark) to the Shuvalov palace on Nevsky Prospekt for
a reception and banquet under chandeliers. Champanski, wine and vodka flowed
and a plump coloratura from the Kirov sang Tchaikovsky love songs. But for
the guests' couture clothes and county accents, it might have been a routine
communist bacchanal.
Later, at the five-star Hotel Astoria, reality intruded. Two men - one
young, one old, both drunk - lurched in off the street and made for the bar.
'I say, you're drunk,' observed an Englishman, who was pretty drunk himself.
The young man replied by opening his jacket, pulling a gun from his
waist-band and pointing it at his interlocutor's midriff. 'What's that for?
Put it away,' expostulated the Englishman. The old man intervened, motioning
to the other to comply. 'Is for my son protection,' he explained, thickly.
'He is security man. Afghan veteran.'
Russia is an 'emerging destination' according to the suave Old Etonian
responsible for piloting this first cargo safely through the criminal
shoals. Moscow Life, an English-language sheet, was more explicit. 'It's
heartening to report that fewer crimes have been committed against foreign
nationals in Moscow,' it said. 'All sizeable criminal syndicates are
pre-occupied with sorting out relations between themselves.' It went on to
itemise the haul of weapons in recent traffic checks in the city: 'Over 40
sub-machine guns, three grenade launchers and 17 hand grenades, over 2,000
rounds of ammunition and 11 home-made bombs.'
Bussed hither and thither to museums, palaces and churches, dropped briefly
at photographic vantage points chosen for them by their guide, the
passengers of the Bolshoi Express were shielded from the worst. Unless they
struck out on their own, they were unlikely to encounter anything more
alarming than a few begging urchins and gipsies.
Yes, Russia is an emerging destination. Recently, a South African paper
manufacturer took 400 prospective clients on a wining and dining weekend to
St Petersburg, a city with a freeze-dried, classical face now rotting away
like an old crone's behind her face powder. Among the principal attractions
of this tour were two dozen security guards supplied by Group 4, a British
company which, some months ago, won a contract to escort prisoners in the UK
 -and promptly lost several.
A complete reversal of values has taken place. Visitors to the Soviet Union
in the bad old days were, of course, permitted to see the Hermitage museum
in Leningrad and the Kremlin churches in Moscow. But their Intourist guides
discouraged too heartfelt an admiration of the past. ('What is that church
over there?' 'Is not church. Is museum of atheism').
Instead, they were invited to applaud health institutes, nursery schools,
war memorials and palaces of culture. Privileged visitors were taken to
locomotive works, power stations and collective farms - champions of
socialist emulation - where they were smothered in statistics before being
sat down to a gargantuan banquet. 'To peace]' the party cadres would cry,
their eyes moist with sentiment and vodka. 'To peace and brotherhood]' But
movement was restricted severely and there were no plugs in the hotel
basins.
Today, there are mixer taps and bathrobes in the foreigners' hotels and the
Intourist guides have gone freelance. There is no more talk of housing
starts and irrigation schemes, only of tsars. Teenagers are free to
skateboard in front of the Winter Palace, the frozen baby mammoth is on a
fund-raising tour of the US, and the tourist is free to travel where he will
 -or dares.
The band played as the party embarked on the train. A girl with a pale,
Mongol face looked out from the adjacent train and turned quickly away. The
champagne was broken out, the steam locomotive admired, the whistle blew and
everyone went to dress for dinner. 'In the evening,' the dress code said,
'gentlemen are requested to wear jackets and ties for dinner, although black
tie is not necessary.'
There were fresh flowers in each sleeping compartment and a Daily Telegraph
map of the former Soviet Union; in the carpeted lavatories, copies of The
Spectator, Vanity Fair and Hello] magazine. Dinner was announced and the
party assembled, as elegant and out-of-place as Agatha Christie's characters
in Death on the Nile.
The girlish blue eyes of the Historical Novelist had been left undimmed by
the sight of sweating heaps of humanity at the railway station. The Tax
Exile appeared, nattily-dressed as ever, and coolly oblivious of the poverty
he had seen. Their friend, the Belgravia Doctor, drank the night away with
nary a glance at the world outside the window.
The solitary figure reputed to be The Man From The Times clung close to his
fellows: knowledgeable about the past, he seemed strangely bewildered by the
present. The Rugby Player - apparently some sort of businessman - grunted
laconically. The Prawn King from Tyneside retained his Geordie humour
throughout - until he was mugged by gipsy children on his way home through
Moscow.
The Ballerina added a final touch of other-worldliness. Natalia Makarova,
former prima ballerina of the Kirov, had been invited to join the train
along with her Lebanese-American businessman husband and their 15-year-old
son, Andrusha. She was followed at every step by a BBC cameraman, a
producer-director and a girl with a clipboard, while she packed and
unpacked, ate and drank, and talked about how it felt to revisit the country
from which she absconded in 1970. The fare-paying passengers thus found
themselves unwilling extras in a three-dimensional travelogue: looking at
themselves being filmed looking at Makarova while she looked at Russia.
If the ballerina was shocked by what she saw, her companions were more
shocked by what they had to pay. The Soviet Union was never cheap for
westerners, if only because of an artificially inflated rate of exchange
which demanded sterling-rouble parity. In each city where foreigners were
permitted, there was a hard-currency hotel and bar.
Today the rouble, debauched by Russia's central bank, is worth about a 10th
of one American cent. Soviet citizens formerly had money to spend but
nothing much to spend it on. Thanks to the black market racketeers, they can
now buy most things - even bananas - but they cannot afford them.
In the two-tier economy that has emerged, foreigners must pay international
prices if they wish to inhabit the first tier. One couple from the Bolshoi
Express, more enterprising than the rest, discovered the remnants of the
rouble economy and managed a day-long excursion into the countryside on 260
roubles (about 25p).
The others gagged when offered chips at the Slavjanskaya, a business hotel
in Moscow, for Dollars 6 a plate. 'But that's a teacher's weekly wage here]'
they protested.
A young woman in one of the new private-sector souvenir shops admitted that
she earned in three days what it had taken her a month to earn before as a
teacher. Standing before rows of matrioshka dolls - the population of which
has exploded - she confessed that her sights were raised higher still.
'I would like a foreign husband,' she said, gaily.
Wasn't she married?
'Yes. But no good,' she laughed.
In the scramble for dollars, everyone has to be on the make. Military
bandsmen go busking and children play truant from school to wheedle dollars
at the places where the coaches stop. Books bought for roubles in the shops
during the week go on sale on the street for dollars at the weekend.
Every trader is paying protection money to someone. The 'protectors' are
identified easily: they wear expensive and flashy clothes and lounge on
street corners with mobile telephones to their ears.
They also control the prostitutes who now haunt the foreigners' hotels
routinely. A couple of listless teenagers with dyed-blonde hair and leather
mini-skirts sat in the bar of the Astoria, watching a television game show
called First Love. It was a pygmy version of Blind Date in which precocious
munchkins (some of them also wearing mini-skirts) won prizes and applause
for cute comments about pre-teen romance.
The Bolshoi Express chugged southwards. The Old Etonian began to breathe
more easily: his Russian barman had been persuaded to serve gin and tonics
in one glass instead of two, the passengers had begun to form into discrete
gossip groups and were, happily, looking out their desert wardrobes.
At Volgograd, formerly Stalingrad, where Hitler suffered his first defeat at
the hands of the Red Army in the battle that changed the course of the
second world war, this passenger turned for home.
The local airport is a rickety affair standing above the monstrous, grey
city. The woman behind the counter pulled a face. 'Moscow?' she said.
'Flight is full up.' Shown a ticket, booked and confirmed, she smiled,
pityingly.
At that moment, two preppy young Americans came bounding into the
foreigners' lounge. They joked in fluent Russian with the clerk, who seemed
to know them. They were officials of the International Finance Corporation,
the private sector arm of the World Bank, going home on leave after long
months privatising the city of Volgograd. 'Don't worry,' they advised. 'She
always says that.'
The woman pretended to make a telephone call, shuffled some papers, stamped
the ticket, looked up and said boldly: 'One dollar.' It was the final
squeeze.
                           *      *      *
THE Bolshoi Express runs from St Petersburg to Tashkent, and vice versa,

FT  10 JUL 93 / Chairman of Spring Ram urged to quit by shareholder
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR BILL ROONEY, chairman and chief executive of Spring Ram, the bathroom and
kitchens group, has been asked to quit by the Prudential Corporation, the
group's biggest institutional shareholder.
Mr Rooney, a co-founder of Spring Ram, has cut short his holiday in Barbados
to fight for his survival. He has told colleagues that he is prepared to
give up either the role of chairman or chief executive, but not both
positions.
'A showdown is inevitable at the beginning of next week,' said a friend of
Mr Rooney.
The Prudential's ultimatum is the culmination of its many months of
campaigning for management changes at the group.
Mr Rooney is confident of the support of the group's executives, although he
is less certain of being backed by Mr Roy Barber, the group's only
non-executive director.
Mr Barber, a specialist in reviving financially troubled companies, was
appointed in April following the first bout of pressure from the Prudential.
The Prudential, which owns 11.8 per cent of Spring Ram's shares, is
understood to be confident of achieving its aim.
The second biggest institutional shareholder is Baillie Gifford, with 7 per
cent. Mr Rooney and his children own 16 per cent.
The Prudential has decided to act because there have been 'too many
surprises at the group', according to a City financier with a close
knowledge of the insurer, one of the UK's most powerful institutional
investors.
A fortnight ago, Spring Ram warned that profits in the first half of the
current year would be 'substantially lower' than in the previous period,
although five weeks earlier Mr Rooney told the annual meeting that he
thought profits in the full year would be better than in 1992.
That was the third shock for the group's shareholders in just eight months.
Last autumn, the group discovered that profits at its Balterly Bathroom
operation had been overstated as a result of false accounting.
Then in March it disclosed that pre-tax profits in the year to January were
Pounds 26m, a third less than City analysts had been expecting.
Spring Ram's shares were one of the stock market's star performers for much
of the 1980s. At their peak of 181p in May 1992 the company was valued at
Pounds 651m. Yesterday the shares were worth just 48 1/2 p.
Mr Rooney's contract with Spring Ram has no expiry date and his notice
period is two years. He was paid Pounds 100,000 in 1992.

FT  10 JUL 93 / Electricity regulator sets energy-saving incentives:
Littlechild intends to maintain squeeze on charges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INCENTIVES for greater energy saving by electricity users were included for
the first time in a new set of electricity price controls yesterday.
Professor Stephen Littlechild, the industry regulator, is proposing that
electricity distributors spend Pounds 1 on energy efficiency per customer
each year  - or Pounds 100m over the four years that the controls will last.
He also removed incentives which enable electricity companies to make
profits just by selling more electricity rather than by being more
efficient.
The package of measures unveiled by Prof. Littlechild is part one of a
two-year review of prices in the privatised regional electricity companies
(RECs). Although this stage affects only the supply business, which accounts
for 10 per cent of REC operating profits, it indicates that Prof.
Littlechild intends to tighten steadily the squeeze on electricity prices.
He has set a basic limit of Pounds 10m on the costs RECs can pass on to
their customers, plus an allowance for the number of customers and units of
electricity sold. He is also restricting price rises to the rate of
inflation minus two percentage points a year.
However, he will grant an extra allowance for RECs which have exceptional
costs because of factors such as high customer turnover or bad debts.
The company receiving the largest allowance is London Electricity with
Pounds 6m. It was not clear whether the company saw this as enough. A
spokesman said there would be no comment until the board had reviewed the
proposals. Any REC can appeal to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission
against the regulator's actions.
Other RECs said the package looked tough but manageable. Mr John Harris,
chairman of East Midlands Electricity, said: 'It is challenging. But we're
very supportive of his approach because he will be rewarding efficiency.'
Householders will not notice any immediate change from the new controls,
which do not take effect for a year, and the impact of the next stage of the
review, of electricity distribution prices, will be much bigger.
But Prof. Littlechild said yesterday's measures would produce a small cut in
prices, and oblige RECs to be more cost-conscious. He also confirmed his
intention to remove all price controls for customers using more than 100KW a
year, starting next April, as part of a move towards total deregulation by
1998.
On the stock market there was relief that the controls were less tough on
the RECs than feared. But there was disappointment in the energy efficiency
industry at the size of the savings.

FT  10 JUL 93 / Serb president orders release of ailing opposition leader
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BELGRADE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SERBIAN PRESIDENT Slobodan Milosevic yesterday ordered the release of jailed
opposition leader Mr Vuk Draskovic and his wife Danica.
Mr Draskovic had been on hunger strike for eight days in protest against his
detention after a violent anti-government demonstration on June 1.
The order for the couple's release came after intense international pressure
and a warning from doctors treating Mr Draskovic in the main Belgrade
hospital that he 'could die in a matter of hours'.
While thousands gathered in Belgrade's central square to celebrate, Mr
Draskovic had to stay overnight in the Belgrade hospital where he had been
kept, too ill to be moved.
Mr Milosevic said: 'The events accompanying the legal proceedings against
Vuk Draskovic are creating a very ugly picture beneath the dignity of our
nation.' Mr Draskovic was being freed because of 'a real political and media
campaign against Serbia organised by some countries. . . .because of its
battle for freedom and equality.'
Mr Milosevic said Mrs Draskovic would also be freed in order to avoid
'humiliating' Mr Draskovic. 'The two people are extremely attached to one
another and their feelings must be respected.'
The Draskovices were arrested on June 1 after an anti-government protest in
which a policeman died and 28 people were hurt. Police severely beat the
couple while in jail. They later went to hospital, under heavy police guard,
because of the injuries.
Faced with the possibility of mass unrest if Mr Draskovic died, Mr Milosevic
issued the order for his release. However, he made clear that Mr Draskovic,
head of the Serbian Renewal party, the country's largest opposition group,
would still face assault charges against a policeman.
The order came only a few hours after the German government and US President
Bill Clinton pressed for the release of the couple from prison.
In Sarajevo, meanwhile, the first cases of typhus were reported yesterday as
the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees warned that the city was
on the 'brink of disaster'.
Bosnia radio reported an outbreak of seven cases of typhus and 700 cases of
dysentery in the shattered capital.
Bosnia's collective presidency voted against the ethnic division of Bosnia
and called for a new London conference on the war-torn republic.
Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg, the international mediator, is due to meet eight of
the 10 members of the rotating leadership today in Zagreb, the Croatian
capital.

FT  10 JUL 93 / The Lex Column: Champagne
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Remy Cointreau's results this week were enough to make even the best
champagne go flat. Its margins on the bubbly drink fell to just 7 per cent
from 15 per cent and, due to the continuing pressure of high grape prices,
there is unlikely to be much relief this year. Remy, of course, is not
alone. Margins at LVMH, in which Guinness has a 24 per cent stake, fell 9
points to 15 per cent last year and are still headed down. The producers say
the problem is basically cyclical. Margins should eventually recover as
grape prices come down, surplus stocks are sold and economic recovery
encourages consumers to trade up.
Such optimism is based on past experience of the notoriously cyclical
industry, but it may not be so easy to put the fizz back in the bottle this
time round. Whereas spirits producers can raise margins by exploiting new
markets in the developing world, champagne is traditionally a first world
drink. Sluggish growth and low inflation in industrial countries may cause
consumers to remain more careful about what they spend.
Nor, despite their dastardly onslaught on elderflower cordial, have
champagne producers done much to protect their brand. Price cutting and the
launch of cut-price petits champagnes do not enhance its image. Producers
may assume this can be corrected as the surplus disappears. Given the
growing market for high quality methode traditionelle sparkling wines,
though, they risk creating a permanent reduction in the base from which
premium brands are priced. The cachet of champagne could then waft away like
the once-expensive smoke of a Marlboro cigarette.

FT  10 JUL 93 / The Lex Column: Evered Bardon
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Evered Bardon had little choice but to raise fresh equity. Its debt was a
burden even before sterling's devaluation inflated the cost of servicing
dollar-denominated loans. Disposals were the obvious answer, but for the
fact that its most saleable asset - the Civil &amp; Marine dredging business -
was valued in the accounts Pounds 60m above current market value. For a
company uncomfortably close to breaching its banking covenants, that
write-down would have been too much to bear.
Even after yesterday's Pounds 72m rights issue and assuming C&amp;M is now sold,
Evered Bardon will be perhaps 45 per cent geared. Since it expects to leak
cash again this year and be at best cash neutral next, debt might yet nose
higher again. Having relaxed its covenants, there is little immediate danger
from the banks. But neither has management an entirely free hand. That might
not matter if it could promise a speedy profits recovery from the existing
businesses. While the prospects in the US are encouraging, there is scope
for disappointment in the UK - especially if the government's road building
programme falls victim to the November Budget.
On that basis, the rights issue looks more like a running repair rather than
a thorough overhaul of the balance sheet. Evered Bardon's assets might be
worth more to an owner with the financial muscle to solve its problems once
and for all.

Kremlinologists will doubtless comb through Professor Stephen Littlechild's
report into the electricity supply business. While supply to customers
accounts for only 6 per cent of the cost of electricity to domestic
customers, the regulator's attitude to the more significant electricity
distribution business might shine between the lines of the report. At first
sight, the supply review suggests an easy ride for the regional electricity
companies. Not only was the RPI-X price cap tightened less than expected,
but the RECs have been granted a 20 per cent increase in their allowable
costs.
Yet there were hints that next year's distribution review would be tougher.
Companies such as Eastern, which have got on with cost cutting, are likely
to find more favour than those which are dragging their feet. More of the
market has been opened to competition, and in this area Offer has decided to
eliminate price controls immediately. This shows confidence that competition
will develop and will give valuable experience of how newly-competitive
markets behave ahead of the deregulation of the domestic market in 1998.
The regulator is also developing a yardstick to monitor REC costs which,
while not yet a formal benchmark, may become so if price regulation is still
needed after the market is fully opened up. However, while life will
doubtless become tougher for the RECs as competition increases and
regulation tightens, their financial position means that they will still be
able to generate strong dividend increases for the foreseeable future.

FT  10 JUL 93 / The Lex Column: Germany out in front
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It is tempting to see this week as one of turning points. The main
industrial countries made a breakthrough in the Uruguay Round of trade
liberalisation. Frankfurt equities surged 6 per cent on the
unlikely-sounding belief that the German economy had both reached its nadir
and that the Bundesbank was set to accelerate the pace of interest rate
cuts. An end to Europe's high interest regime would indeed be a relief, but
there is a risk of excessive expectations both for that and for the Uruguay
Round.
The thought that the German economy might be on the turn must worry US and
UK funds who are underweight in German equities. But, on a market multiple
of more than 20 times next year's earnings, shares are not exactly cheap.
The Bundesbank might cut rates sharply to help the French franc. Or, as
before, it may do just enough to keep France in the ERM. That will not do
much for growth in either country. Besides, if European rates do come down,
French shares may benefit more than German. Swiss companies would derive a
greater earnings boost from any concomitant appreciation of the dollar.
The rush of interest in Germany may owe something to the feeling that equity
markets elsewhere look unexciting. That consideration may also help keep
money flowing into bonds despite the pressure of industrial country budget
deficits. As for the Uruguay Round, it will be a long time before last
week's breakthrough is translated into non-inflationary growth. That the
Round has been saved from collapse removes a downside risk for equities just
the same.

FT  10 JUL 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow subdued after volatile
price swings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US STOCK markets ended a week of volatile prices swings on a subdued note
yesterday, with stocks ending little changed in light trading, writes
Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up only 6.64 at 3,521.06.
The more broadly based Standard&amp;Poor's 500 ended 0.53 lower at 448.11, while
the Amex composite finished up 1.82 at 434.37, and the Nasdaq composite up
3.05 at 705.76. Trading volume on the NYSE was 235m shares.
On Tuesday, prices fell sharply on concerns about the economy, corporate
earnings and rising commodities prices. Over the following two days,
however, the markets staged an impressive rally, aided by a downturn in
commodities prices and some rare good economic news. By yesterday, it was
clear that investors and dealers had exhausted their interest in equities,
at least temporarily.
Trading throughout the day was light, and stocks barely moved from their
opening values. Although commodities prices picked up again, prompting a
brief sell-off in bonds, the equity markets payed little attention. A late
recovery in bond prices, however, did help ensure stocks mostly remained in
positive territory. Airlines were once again in the firing line, with
worries about the impact on earnings of the latest round of price
competition, and disappointing June air travel figures, inflicting the
damage. USAir fell falling Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 14 in early trading,
before rallying to end down Dollars  5/8 at Dollars 14 3/4 . Also lower were
AMR, down Dollars  3/8 at Dollars 61 1/2 and UAL, Dollars  3/4 lower at
Dollars 123 1/2 .
Car stocks were higher as a group, as investor confidence in the outlook for
car sales and corporate profits continued to build. Chrysler put on Dollars
 1/2 at Dollars 47 5/8 , General Motors added Dollars  3/8 at Dollars 47 3/8
, and Ford climbed Dollars  7/8 at Dollars 52 1/8 .
Baxter International dropped Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 26 7/8 in heavy
trading after the company said it expected second quarter operating income
to come in below the Dollars 252m earned a year ago.
Bristol-Myers Squibb initially rose more than Dollars 1 on reports that the
company has had some success in fighting lung and colon cancer, in animals
with a combination of its cancer drug and monoclonal antibodies, but later
fell back to end unchanged at Dollars 58 1/8 . Compaq firmed Dollars 1 1/4
to Dollars 45 3/4 after SG Warburg raised its investment rating on the stock
from a 'hold' to a 'buy'.
Canada
TORONTO prices posted a small gain in moderate trading, after yesterday's
sharp decline. Based on preliminary figures, the TSE-300 index was up 6.57
points, or 0.17 per cent, to close at 3,927.43, for a loss on the week of
about 70 points.
Mining and consumer products posted small gains, financial services was flat
and the gold group lost 1.07 per cent.

FT  10 JUL 93 / World Stock Markets: Mexico vulnerable to shifts in Nafta
talks - Economic woes also persist
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If you like to gamble,' says Mr Felix Boni, head of research at the Mexican
brokerage, Interacciones, 'gamble that there will be a North American Free
Trade Agreement by January, and buy Mexican stocks.'
Mr Boni sums up the driving force behind the equity market: with Nafta in
trouble for much of this year, the market has drifted from 1,759 at the
beginning of January to 1,710.65 at the close yesterday. Occasional good
news on Nafta has sent the market up, only for it to fall again on some
unexpected bad news.
The last two weeks have been no different. Ten days ago, the market fell by
nearly 2 per cent in a few hours as a US federal judge ordered the Clinton
administration to conduct a lengthy study of Nafta's environmental impact,
potentially delaying the treaty to next year, or even derailing it.
But this week the bolsa has surged, partly as investors reckoned that last
week's pessimism over Nafta had been overdone.
Salomon Brothers, for instance, argues that last week's ruling by the judge
will be repealed, or ignored, and that negotiations on parallel agreements
on labour and the environment will be wrapped up by the end of August.
If the economy was in better shape, then the Nafta talks would doubtless be
less important to investors. But the government has been forced this year to
run a budget surplus and push interest rates over 5 per cent in real terms
to slow inflation, reduce demand for imports, and finance a Dollars 20bn
trade deficit.
However, if Nafta is passed, more foreign capital is likely to flow into
Mexico, and the government could lower interest rates and increase spending
without endangering its exchange and inflation rate targets. An agreement
should, therefore, boost company sales and lower their financial costs.
Under this scenario equities would look a bargain: the 30 largest listed
stocks tracked by Baring Securities are trading at an estimated 1993 p/e
ratio of just 10.3, compared with 14.9 in Chile, 12.5 in Argentina, and 10.4
in Brazil.
But, as yet, there is no sign of a pick-up in the economy: first quarter
growth was a modest 2.4 per cent, with some manufacturing sectors actually
shrinking, and no-one is forecasting an expansion of more than 3 per cent
for the year.
The sluggish economy helped lower first quarter average earnings of the top
60 companies by some 10 per cent in real terms. But not all were affected
equally. Some sectors, mainly in manufacturing, consumer goods, and heavy
industry, fared worse than the average, while construction continued to
expand.
The result is that some stocks, mostly construction and mining, have risen
in the past three months, while others, such as Telmex, Alfa, Tamsa and TMM,
have slid on fears of lower earnings. 'Share prices have even varied within
sectors as individual companies successfully adjust to growing competition
and tighter margins, while competitors do not', says Mr Timothy Heyman, head
of the Baring Securities office in Mexico City.
Investors are now bracing themselves for second quarter results. Mr Pyers
Griffith at James Capel in Mexico City says that sentiment in the corporate
sector is depressed, and reckons earnings will be flat, or possibly down. Mr
Heyman says that there will be a wide disparity in performance both between
and within sectors, suggesting the importance of individual stock selection.
Investors's attention will be fixed on Telmex, the exchange's largest stock
in terms of market capitalisation, whose share price is already down nearly
20 per cent in the past six months.
Telmex reported a 4.3 per cent decrease in profits and a worse than expected
increase in revenues for the first quarter. Last month it warned that the
second quarter was going to be difficult, causing another precipitous slide
in the price.
After the second quarter reporting season is over prospects for the market
may improve. Mexico's inflation rate has finally reached single digits,
while the trade balance has stopped growing. The government, therefore, has
been able to allow interest rates on short-term government paper to fall to
a year's low of 14.1 per cent without provoking capital outflows.
If inflation continues to fall, and the trade balance shows further
improvement, then the government could afford a further loosening in
monetary and fiscal policy without raising the spectre of a devaluation.
With a number of Mexican companies  - Aeromexico, ICA, Tamsa and Cemex among
others  - heavily indebted in foreign currency, a devaluation would hit the
market hard.
Even during the bolsa's falls, foreign investors have shown a surprising
interest in individual equity offerings. In the past couple of months a
number of companies have made initial public offerings successfully in
Mexican and international markets.
A year ago such offerings would have been scuttled in a weak market; but
foreign investors are showing more ability at discriminating between the
market and individual stocks.

FT  10 JUL 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): DAX 1,800 breakthrough
reversed at close
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE question of the day was whether Frankfurt would extend its uptrend and
take the DAX index through 1,800. Its limited success in this endeavour left
bourses looking more sedate than they had done over the previous two days,
writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT failed to sustain its DAX breakthrough and the index closed up
13.71 on the day at 1,797.41 after a high of 1,804.56. It was still 5.9 per
cent firmer on the week.
Turnover was expected to remain high after Thursday's DM15.5bn. The Goldman
Sachs strategists, Mr Sushil Wadhwani and Mr Mushtaq Shah, wrote yesterday
that a short-term bubble was now probable, with underweight foreign
investors continuing to be drawn in and a 1,850-1,900 range on the cards.
'However,' they said, 'valuation considerations suggest to us that the
medium-term upside is likely to be relatively limited.'
Meanwhile, non-cyclicals were allowed to shine with Allianz up DM43 to
DM4,303, Deutsche Bank adding DM7.50 to DM725.50 and Schering DM24.40 to
DM843. Mr Mark Tracey at Goldman Sachs said that Schering's merger of its
agrochemical interests made it more of a pure healthcare company; that an
important drug approval was expected imminently in the US; and a licensing
agreement with Hafslund, of Norway was a third bull point on the day.
However, there was still life in the cyclicals where Linde, the engineer,
rose DM15.50 to DM810.50 and Volkswagen saw foreign interest as it rose
DM7.70 to DM373.60.
PARIS kept its attention fixed firmly on the currency markets as the franc
slipped to a three-month low against the D-Mark. There were reports of
intervention by the Bank of France to support the currency, rumours that the
government was meeting to discuss the issue, and even speculation,
particularly among US institutions, that France might leave the ERM to be
able to cut interest rates independently of Germany.
The CAC-40 index ended up 5.33 at 1,985.70, a gain of 2.3 per cent on the
week.
Morgan Stanley commented that a potential currency crisis was imminent as
the speculators 'smell blood and the feeling grows that this time it will be
politically and economically difficult for France to raise interest rates'.
The brokers said that a further round of European rate cuts was necessary
and forecast that interest rates would fall sharply over the next twelve
months.
Peugeot featured with a FFr17 advance to FFr635 as investors latched on to
data which showed its share of the European market improving.
Euro Disney eased a further 6.5 per cent following Thursday's dismal
forecasts, falling FFr3.90 to FFr55.60.
AMSTERDAM moved modestly higher, the CBS Tendency index finishing 0.7 up at
116.7, a week's rise of 3.7 per cent.
Kleinwort Benson's Dutch team, writing in their latest research paper,
continued to recommend a 'primarily defensive portfolio' over the summer.
'Last year's relative appreciation of the Dutch guilder,' they observed,
'will have a dampening impact on the recovery potential of corporate
earnings'.
Cyclical stocks remained prominent after Thursday's strong gains, with DSM
up Fl 2.40 to Fl 95.10 and Akzo rising Fl 2.50 to Fl 161.40.
The publishing sector also featured, with Elsevier up 60 cents at Fl 141.10
for a new year's high and Wolters Kluwer putting on Fl 1.10 to Fl 96.90 .
MILAN was largely preoccupied by technical trading ahead of the expiry of
options early next week. The Comit index closed marginally ahead, up 0.57 at
544.24, a week's rise of 1.1 per cent.
Fiat continued to feature following disappointing sales figures released
earlier this week and its announcement yesterday that it was to make more
temporary lay-offs in the autumn. The car group's shares fell L120 to
L6,405, before picking up slightly to L6,470 on the kerb.
Telecommunications also featured with Sip among the day's most actives, up
L15 at L2,701 and Stet gaining L40 to L3,650.
ZURICH featured more profit-taking in UBS bearers, SFr12 lower on the day at
SFr1,160 but still 4 per cent higher on the week. The SMI index finished at
2,402.7 with gains of 4.8 and 1.4 per cent respectively.
BRUSSELS, one of last week's strong points, accelerated again after a period
of digestion, the Bel 20 index rising by 16.35, most of the week's 1.5 per
cent gain, to 1,301.56.
VIENNA continued to follow Frankfurt, taking its rise on the week to 3.4 per
cent with the ATX index up 9.37 higher at 868.39.
STOCKHOLM continued in ebullient form on foreign buying, the Affarsvarlden
index gaining 8.60 to 1,115.20, a week's gain of 2.4 per cent.
ISTANBUL lost another 4.8 per cent as many investors took note of a
government statement confirming that the budget deficit for 1993 is likely
to be three times worse than previous forecasts. The composite index lost
513.9 to 10,275.3, a week's decline of nearly 15 per cent.

FT  10 JUL 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei gains on G7
summit declaration
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE economic declaration of the G7 summit, which included clauses calling
for Japan to take fiscal and monetary measures to revive its sluggish
economy, prompted hopes of monetary easing by the Bank of Japan, writes
Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei average closed 188.72 higher at 19,877.39, 1.3 per cent higher on
the week, on buying by arbitrageurs and public pension funds. The index
opened at the day's low of 19,699.97 and rose to a high of 19,946.79 just
before the close.
Volume rose from 349m to 480m shares. While this was the highest level since
June 11, traders said that July futures options settlements and speculative
trading in Nikkatsu accounted for about 200m shares.
Advances led declines by 761 to 227 with 141 unchanged. The Topix index of
all first section stocks gained 17.69 to 1,608.62 and, in London, the
ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 1.79 to 1,219.58.
At the end of the G7 summit Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the Japanese prime minister,
said that while the government did not intend to introduce another economic
stimulus package, spending on public works projects, including high
technology infrastructure, would be increased.
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone gained on Mr Miyazawa's comments, rising
Y19,000 to Y884,000. Other high-technology issues also advanced, with NEC up
Y11 to Y957 and Fujitsu rising Y24 to Y740.
Nikkatsu, the most active issue of the day with almost 20 per cent of the
day's volume, rose Y9 to Y25. The film producer and distributor, which filed
for court protection last week, has recently become a speculative favourite
among traders looking for quick profits.
Hopes of lower interest rates helped banks. Industrial Bank of Japan rose
Y40 to Y3,050 and Mitsubishi Bank added Y60 to Y2,830.
In Osaka, the OSE average rose 168.78 to 21,929.23 in volume of 13.6m
shares.
Roundup
WHERE it moved, the region maintained an upward trend.
NEW ZEALAND registered another three-year high, the NZSE-40 index closing
7.17 higher at 1,723.66, 1.4 per cent higher on the week. Volume was
NZDollars 40m, the bulk of it in Carter Holt and Telecom.
Telecom rose another 5 cents to Dollars 3.31; Carter Holt was unchanged at
Dollars 2.94.
SEOUL's composite index rose 9.78 higher at 770.46, 3.2 per cent higher on
the week, in a session dominated by strong interest in construction and
financial stocks.
TAIWAN featured late buying of textiles and blue chips, with strong interest
in China Steel, 90 cents higher at TDollars 20.20 on reports of good profits
in June.
The textile stock, Hualon, also gained 60 cents, to TDollars 26.20 as the
weighted index ended 50.88 higher at 4,068.47, 3.7 per cent up on the week.
Turnover remained thin at TDollars 14.95bn.
AUSTRALIA saw a drop in golds after the bullion price lost its impetus, the
gold shares index ending 40.5 lower at 2,172.9. However, the All Ordinaries
index still managed to end 0.4 higher at 1,782.9, a new, post-1987 crash
high.
A strong News Corp helped support the market. It peaked at ADollars 8.00, to
finish 20 cents up at ADollars 7.92 after a link up between its BSkyB arm
and Australian analysts on Thursday boosted confidence in the stock.
HONG KONG saw late selling as the latest Sino-British talks on the colony
ended without agreement. The Hang Seng index lost 51.78 to 7,070.61, 2 per
cent lower on the week, although turnover stayed thin at HKDollars 3.29bn,
against HKDollars 2.95bn on Thursday.
Most blue chips were hit by the late selling with Cheung Kong dipping 40
cents to HKDollars 26.40 and its affiliate, Hutchison Whampoa, off 20 cents
to HKDollars 21.40.

FT  10 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DIRECTIONLESS trading continued to dog stock index futures with the
September contract slipping 10 points on the previous day's close, writes
Christine Buckley.
After a steady opening which saw the contract start at 2,863 and touch
2,872, a spate of lunchtime selling knocked the shine off and set a downward
course for the day.
Some blame was put on the buoyant activity in the FT Mid-250 which is
diverting attention from the FT-SE 100 with the knock-on effect on footsie
futures.
With the past resistance level at 2,900 many traders seem to now be focusing
on the 2,850 mark with anything below that stimulating some buying and
anything above sparking selling.
The day's low was in the last half hour of trading when September dipped to
2,838 and pushed up 1 to close at 2,839, trailing cash by 5 points. Volume
was 8,918 contracts.
Turnover in the traded options fell to 24,314 lots against the previous
day's 32,387. BP was the top stock option at 2,021 lots.

FT  10 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: Hanson advances
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, JOEL KIBAZO, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Recommendations from two brokers helped international conglomerate Hanson
round off an active week in the London market. The shares put on 3 1/4 to
234p, with volume this time reaching 16m, after James Capel recommended the
stock. Hoare Govett which issued a 46- page revue of the group's US
construction interests urged investors to buy the stock suggesting it was
'undervalued'. Its current year profits forecast of Pounds 1,093m remains
unchanged.
Hanson has been in demand since its announcement at the end of last month
that it is to acquire Quantum Chemical of the US.
Container rental group Tiphook asked the stock exchange to investigate
dealings in its stock after the shares dived in the first half of the
session.
What initially appeared to be a bear raid sent the shares crashing 45 to
283p, at the day's worst. The slide prompted the company, which reports
results next Wednesday, to say the figures would include a number of
accounting changes, 'to bring the company's reporting more in line with US
accounting principles.' Around 45 per cent of the stock is held by US
investors.
However, analysts were unsure how to read the statement or how it would
alter the headline profit figure reported next week. Many remain nervous
after the company surprised the market with a profits warning last April.
The shares rallied to close a net 40 down at 288p, on volume of 1.8m.
Speculation that Thorn EMI was close to sealing a deal on the disposal of
its electronics division to GEC was heightened by confirmation of
negotiations from the two companies. Thorn shares gained 3 to 909p. GEC lost
3 to 316p.
Ladbroke climbed 3 to 188p with SG Warburg said to be positive. Thursday's
profits warning from Euro Disney again hounded the theme park operator. The
shares reached a new low of 638p, a fall of 37 on the day.
Vague takeover talk was heard around Joseph Holt and the stock added 63 to
3138p.
BT retreated 8 1/2 to 416p as it announced that the bookbuilding that
started on Thursday had already attracted sufficient bids to cover the
International Offer.
Wellcome was the biggest casualty in the FTSE-100 as investors fretted over
reports of alternative Aids drugs. The shares fell 12 to 657p.
Royal Insurance moved 4 ahead to 319p, following a recommendation from
NatWest Securities. The broker said: 'Royals is the composite with most to
gain from the upturn in insurance rates even after its rights issue.'
Stake-building speculation returned to Sun Alliance sending volume rising to
2.7m, its highest daily total since mid-June when Transatlantic revealed a
strategic 3 per cent stake, as the shares advanced 12 to 373p.
Helical Bar's move to raise Pounds 20m in a preferential rights issue and an
upbeat message from the chairman pleased the market and the share price
moved ahead 10 to 236p.
Asda Properties benefited from a BZW buy note and added 3 to 88p.
In banking stocks, Barclays Bank eased 11 to 480p on a combination of
profit-taking and cautious comments from US investment bank Goldman Sachs.
Market newcomer Field Group continued its honeymoon with investors, adding 4
to 284p. Smith New Court moved to back the packaging company with a buy note
and confidence that Field will keep its market leader position.

There were strong rumours in food retailing circles that Mr Bob Emmott, the
former joint deputy managing director of Wm Morrison Supermarkets who
resigned earlier this week, would next week turn up in a senior position at
J Sainsbury. If true, it would represent a considerable coup for the latter
chain. Morrison's shares benefited from support from BZW and gained 7 to
141p. Sainsbury weakened 4 to 443p.

RELIEF greeted the first report from the director-general of Electricity
Supply on price controls and shares in the regional electricity companies
saw healthy gains. The industry had feared the regulator would come down
heavier on the measurement of generating costs and comment on the levels of
dividends. The Recs' reporting season, just ended, saw a 'dividend race'
develop as the companies revealed hefty increases with Southern turning in a
winning 17.6 per cent rise.
The market was also pleased by the new pricing formula having feared a
figure of four instead of the two allocated. Among the rises yesterday,
London put on 14 to 499p, Seeboard 15 to 525p, Midlands 13 to 508p and
Southern 7 to 504p. Mr Angelos Anastasiou at Panmure Gordon said: 'After the
recent strong showing by the shares, the upside from here may be limited,
but there's no reason for them to go down.'
One of the other beneficiaries of the report was the water sector where
hopes of similar treatment from Ofwat combined with strong yield support to
see solid advances. Among these, Anglian added 11 to 495p, Severn Trent 12
to 475p with 2.3m traded and Thames 13 to 490p.

FT  10 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: Shares fail to hold on to early gains
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN EARLY strong performance by the UK equity market was gradually eroded
yesterday leaving the blue chip issues marginally lower on the day. The
deterioration came amid renewed suspicions that the big international
institutions could be moving money out of leading UK equities and into the
German market.
Second line and smaller stocks proved much more resilient, however, closing
with good overall gains on the session. Gilt-edged stocks closed with gains
of  3/16 .
The FT-SE 100 index ended the day a net 2.7 lower at 2,843.2, while the
FT-SE Mid 250 index settled 10.4 higher at 3,236.8. Over the week, the
senior of the two indices fell 14.5 while the smaller index managed a
2-point rise.
The market began the session in fine form, with Wall Street's overnight
strength, renewed gains across most European bourses and talk of a possible
reduction in UK interest rates triggering an early mark up.
An opening gain of 7.5 on the FT-SE 100 was extended to one of 12.3, the
day's high-point, shortly after midday. Thereafter, London's initial
positive sentiment began to waiver and bouts of profit-taking in the cash
market and the Footsie future, reacting to a neutral opening by Wall Street,
put pressure on equities.
The rate cut stories were backed up in the market by news that at least
three of the leading London broking firms - James Capel, SG Warburg
Securities and SG Strauss Turnbull - had reduced their year-end base-rate
forecasts. Warburg's strategy team said that with gilt yields falling and
inflation indicators generally encouraging 'it is hard to be particularly
bearish from current levels,' although it cautions 'there is still no sign
of any clear upward momentum developing in analysts earnings estimates'. On
the rate cut hopes, Strauss's Ian Harnett said: 'It's not a question of
whether there's a rate cut, but when.' He sees the market as reasonably
priced at present but warned that 'the market will be below these levels by
the end of September.'
BT shares were unnerved by two critical press stories and hints that a
bearish review of the company is about to be published by a London broker.
There was plenty of activity in the insurance areas, where Sun Alliance
continued to respond to hints that Transatlantic, jointly owned by Liberty
Life and UAP, could have been adding to their 'strategic' holding.

FT  10 JUL 93 / Money Markets: French rates soar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FRENCH franc money market interest rates rose sharply yesterday as the
currency fell below the FFr3.40 level against the D-Mark, writes James
Blitz.
As pressure on the franc intensified on the foreign exchanges, French
interest rates rose above their German counterparts for the first time in
several months.
This was seen as the clearest indication this week that investors are once
again treating the franc as a possible candidate for devaluation.
At the same time, there was a slightly more optimistic outlook for German
interest rate reductions because dealers believed that the Bundesbank would
have to ease policy soon if the franc fort policy was to hold.
Three month French franc interest rates rose by nearly 100 basis points on
the bid side in the European morning, from 7.52 per cent to 8.48 per cent.
After lunchtime, they fell back to around 7.75 per cent, even though the
currency remained firmly below the FFr3.40 level against the D-Mark.
This left French franc interest rates some 50 basis points higher than
Germany's, which closed at around 7.25 per cent. Only a few weeks ago,
French franc interest rates were some 80 basis points below Germany's. The
turn-around is an important indication that investors feel they need an
interest rate premium to hold the French currency once again.
The response in interest rate futures markets was similar. The September
Pibor contract plunged another 23 basis points, to close at 93.04. The
spread between the September and December contracts has now widened to 100
basis points, suggesting that investors think French rates will be at 6 per
cent by the winter, whether the country is in the exchange rate mechanism or
not.
Euromark futures enjoyed a rise, however, amid speculation that the
Bundesbank will be forced by this new development to ease rates next week.
The September Euromark contract rose 6 basis points to close at 93.26. At
least one dealer speculated yesterday that the Bundesbank might lower both
the repo rate and the Lombard rate.
Sterling markets were sidelined. Most of a Pounds 1.1bn shortage was
despatched in the early round of discount market dealing, and 3-month money
remained unchanged at around 5 15/16 per cent.

FT  10 JUL 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Intervention fails the franc
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE French franc again came under strong pressure inside the European
exchange rate mechanism yesterday, forcing the Bank of France to support the
currency through repeated intervention, writes James Blitz.
In early morning trading in Europe, the franc fell through the FFr3.40
level, a little more than 3 centimes above its ERM floor against the D-Mark
of FFr3.4330. It later closed at FFr3.399 from a previous FFr3.395.
Yesterday's intervention by the French central bank was covert, and dealers
were uncertain as to its size. One London-based analyst suggested that the
French authorities had spent around Dollars 10bn supporting the currency in
recent days, which would constitute a sizeable chunk of reserves.
But others dubbed this an exaggeration. Given the state of the recession in
France, the authorities would find it hard to defend the currency by raising
interest rates, and may have held back their reserves for another day.
There were differences of opinion over what kind of selling of francs was
taking place. A commonly held view was that much of the selling was coming
from French companies rather than international players, such as the US
hedge funds.
Others suspected that the selling was short-term and speculative. Mr Jeremy
Hawkins, economic adviser at Bank of America, said it was hard to take the
flight out of francs and into D-Marks seriously, given the German currency's
significant overvaluation in Europe. 'This buying of D-Marks somehow seems
artificial,' he said.
There was little doubt that the franc would come under more pressure next
week unless the Bundesbank eased pressure on the franc by easing monetary
policy. One London-based analyst said that a cut in the Lombard rate at next
week's Bundesbank council meeting could pacify the markets. Others said that
another salami-sized cut in interest rates from the Bundesbank would be
ignored by the markets.
The pressure on the franc was at the centre of another flight into the
German currency and assets which pushed down the Italian lira, the Spanish
peseta and the Swedish krona. A notable victim yesterday was the Danish
krone, which fell from DKr3.8550 early in London trading to close at around
DKr3.8650.
The dollar rallied sharply against the D-Mark, helped by expectations that
the Bundesbank would ease policy and next week and the 'safe haven' status
it enjoys at times of crisis. The US currency closed more than 1 1/2
pfennigs higher at DM1.7210.

FT  10 JUL 93 / International Company News: Gerstner rules out early
restructuring at IBM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Lou Gerstner, International Business Machines' new chairman and chief
executive, has told senior managers he does not intend to restructure the
company in the near future.
However, his new management approach could raise questions about some
aspects of the reshaping of IBM UK.
As he comes to grips with the problem of reversing IBM's decline, Mr
Gerstner has rejected calls from some IBM managers and many industry
analysts for a radical overhaul of the company's management structure.
'I do not want the company focusing on internal changes in the next 12 to 18
months, but rather on customers, marketplaces and competitors,' Mr Gerstner
said in a memorandum sent to senior managers last week.
'It is not clear to me that there is a demonstrably better alternative (to
the current structure), that eliminates the need for sophisticated
management approaches,' he said.
While continuing with the changes set in motion by Mr John Akers, his
predecessor, to give IBM's product manufacturing and regional sales and
marketing groups greater responsibility for their financial performance, Mr
Gerstner has balked at the idea of cutting ties with central management.
The 'federation of increasingly autonomous business units' envisioned by Mr
Akers is a thing of the past. 'Autonomous is the word that drives me crazy,'
Mr Gerstner has said in management meetings.
Instead, he has set about improving efficiency and responsiveness to
customers within IBM's structure.
Mr Gerstner, in addressing the company's most contentious internal problem,
has called for a clear delineation of responsibilities between the company's
national or regional sales and marketing organisations versus its product
manufacturing groups.
The product groups  - called lines of business in IBM jargon  - are to be
given increased responsibility for sales and marketing.
'Lobs should have dedicated sales resources in each geography,' Mr Gerstner
said. 'The Lob should be heavily involved in determining the size, skill,
training and compensation of these dedicated resources.'
This represents a significant shift of power and responsibilities away from
IBM's country and regional managers. IBM's product groups, most of which
have headquarters in the US, will have increased influence over
international sales and marketing operations.
Mr Gerstner's directive could raise questions about IBM UK's recently
announced plans to divide its operations into 30 separate businesses.
The IBM UK plan now appears to be a regional implementation of Mr Akers'
strategy, rather than a reflection of Mr Gerstner's current thinking.
Indeed, the potential for conflict among IBM UK's newly formed business
units is what Mr Gerstner is attempting to eliminate.
Under the IBM UK reorganisation plan, a mainframe computer sale to a bank
could be made by the banking business sales and marketing unit, or by a
sales team dedicated to the Enterprise Systems (mainframe) product group.
'Duplication and complication should be avoided,' Mr Gerstner said in his
memo to top managers. 'It is my expectation that we will complete all of
this (the company-wide strategy) within the next 90 days.'

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMPAQ Computer, the US personal computer company, plans to set up a
production operation in China, with Shenzhen-based Beijing Stone, a PC
manufacturer and distributor.
Under the 11-year agreement, the joint venture will manufacture PCs for sale
in China and other parts of the world. The venture will lease and manage an
existing 40,000 sq ft Stone facility which will house printed circuit-board
and final-product assembly manufacturing lines. Compaq and Stone expect to
hire about 200 employees over the next year and production is expected to
begin this December.
'The Chinese marketplace represents a tremendous opportunity for Compaq,'
said Mr Eckhard Pfeiffer, Compaq president and chief executive.
Compaq entered China on a limited basis in 1984, becoming fully active in
the market in 1990. It held 18.5 per cent of the market in China, in value
terms, and 16.3 per cent in unit shipments in 1992, according to
International Data Corp.
Last November, Compaq announced the establishment of the Tsinghua University
Training Centre in Beijing, offering instruction in computer hardware and
software. This was a Dollars 1m investment with ComputerLand China and Eekon
Computer Systems, PC distributors.

OCE-VAN der Grinten, the Dutch photocopier and office equipment maker, saw
net profit fall by 47 per cent in the second quarter of 1992-93, virtually
matching the 49 per cent decline posted in the first quarter of the year.
Net profit in the second quarter ended May 31 was Fl 15.9m (Dollars 8.4m),
just over half the Fl 30.1m posted in the same quarter of 1991-92.
This took first-half net profit to Fl 26.7m, against Fl 51.0m a year
earlier.
Oce-van der Grinten blamed the downturn on lower margins caused by a drop in
sales in Europe and the appreciation of the Dutch guilder. However, US sales
and results improved in the second quarter, the company said.
Overall second-quarter sales declined by 8 per cent to Fl 642m while
operating profit including interest income from financial leases fell by 28
per cent to Fl 42.1m.

THE ADollars 2.45bn (USDollars 1.6bn) flotation of Woolworths, the
Australian retailer, due to be listed on Monday, has been heavily
oversubscribed, perhaps by a factor of four or five.
The rush of investor interest is likely to present the vendors, Industrial
Equity (IEL), with problems in allocating shares between public and
institutional investors.
Analysts said IEL may reduce allocations.

<TEXT>
INVESTOR, the Wallenberg family's main holding company, has sold its 7.5 per
cent stake in Christies International, the UK auction house, in a further
consolidation of its shareholding portfolio.
Terms of the deal have not been disclosed, but at Wednesday's closing price
of 191p, the disposal of 11.9m shares is worth Pounds 22.7m (Dollars 34.9m).
The shares were bought by Goldman Sachs which has placed most of them with
institutional investors.
Investor said the move had been made to cut debt and concentrate activities
on Saab-Scania, the aerospace and automotive group, and other core
shareholdings.
Last month, the group raised SKr3bn (Dollars 416.7m) through the sale of its
shareholding in Asea, the joint owner of the Asea Brown Boveri combine, as
part of this strategy.
Investor built up its stake in Christies during 1989 and 1990 at a time when
the UK group's share price was much higher than it is today.
The stake formed part of Investor's trading portfolio and never ranked
alongside its holdings in many of Sweden's blue chip companies as a
strategic investment.

<TEXT>
NIPPON Steel Chemical, a listed chemicals subsidiary of Nippon Steel, the
largest Japanese steel maker, has foreign exchange losses of Y13.9bn
(Dollars 130m) on unauthorised trades made by an accounting division chief
attempting to lift the company's investment income.
The losses were uncovered after the death of the division chief in late May.
The company said there were no suspicious circumstances, but, on checking
his books, found he had lost Y13.9bn in playing dollar future markets.
It is common for Japanese manufacturing companies to supplement their core
profits with zaitech, sometimes speculative financial investments, which
have left otherwise conservative companies with large losses following the
stock market collapse and currency market volatility.
Nippon Steel Chemical has a regulation that foreign currency investments of
more than Y100m need board approval, but the division chief apparently had
invested the equivalent of Y47.3bn in contracts now worth Y33.4bn.
Mr Enji Moriguchi, the company's chairman, has offered to resign after
preparations were made to deal with the loss, which is expected to be
written off over the next two years and covered by the sale of shares and
other assets.
'We are now studying ways to strengthen our management system and control
financial investments,' the company said. Nippon Steel Chemical, based in
Tokyo, produces carbon materials, chemicals and construction supplies.
Nippon Steel said the subsidiary had an independent management which must
take responsibility.

FT  10 JUL 93 / International Company News: Hoechst, Schering to merge units
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HOECHST and Schering, two of Germany's leading chemicals groups, are to
merge their plant protection divisions in a joint venture with annual sales
of about DM3.4bn (Dollars 2.1bn), the companies announced yesterday.
According to a letter of intent, Hoechst will hold a controlling 60 per cent
stake. If there are no objections from the cartel authorities, the
Berlin-based business should start operating at the beginning of 1994.
The move, an important further step in the consolidation of the
international chemicals industry, has been forced by the combined effects of
recession and reforms of the common agricultural policy (Cap).
The Hoechst division, employing 5,350 people, had sales of DM2.1bn last
year, about 5 per cent of the group's total. At Schering, 3,900 are employed
in plant protection, which had sales of DM1.3bn accounting for 20 per cent
of group turnover.
While some factories are expected to close and jobs will be lost, neither
company could give any details.
The full impact would not be known until the form of the business had been
decided during further negotiations, Hoechst said.
Schering relies on the European market for 70 per cent of its sales, which
plummeted 22 per cent in the first quarter. German trade was hit by the
withdrawal of traditional rebates on early orders, while Cap reforms were
blamed for an 18 per cent year-on-year drop in volumes.
With pesticides, weed killers and fungus treatments off its hands, the
company will focus on its core business in pharmaceuticals.
Schering has about 18 per cent of the world market for contraceptive drugs
and claims global leadership in contrast fluids - diagnostic aids used for
X-rays and scanning.
The Hoechst business, partly because of its size and its lesser dependence
on the European market, has proved more resilient to recent shocks. It makes
30 per cent of its sales in the US, where profits have helped offset
operating losses in Europe, which accounts for half the division's turnover.
The merger strengthens Hoechst's position in herbicides, which account for
more than 60 per cent of its agrochemicals sales, and more than 40 per cent
of Schering's turnover in this sector.
In spite of the impact of Cap set-aside schemes on arable crops, the
herbicides market, accounting for 40 per cent of EC agrochemicals sales, is
considered reasonably robust. Even so, analysts reckon that the total
European market for agrochemicals will shrink by up to 20 per cent over the
next three years.
Hoechst said yesterday that companies competing in the sector needed
critical mass and resources in order to develop and produce a continuous
stream of profitable new products.
The agrochemicals business of Roussel Uclaf, France's third largest
pharmaceuticals group in which Hoechst holds a 54.5 per cent stake, is set
to be merged with the joint venture.
Mr Edouard Sakiz, Roussel's president, said last week his agrochemicals
operations were not large enough to survive on their own and that if the
German groups' agrochemicals merger was achieved, then much of the French
company's operations would be added to the venture.
The division had sales last year of FFr3.44bn (Dollars 637.6m), representing
about 23 per cent of group turnover.

<TEXT>
BANCO Central Hispano (BCH), Spain's largest bank in terms of assets,
yesterday reported sharply improved first-half results, raising its
operating profit by 34.8 per cent to Pta98.5bn (Dollars 794m).
Mr Jose Maria Amusategui, chairman, said BCH had overcome the difficulties
of the 1991 merger between its constituent parts, Banco Central and Banco
Hispanoamericano, and was on the road to sustained profitability.
The bank, which saw its 1992 profits fall by 22 per cent to Pta52.6bn after
negative results in the second half of last year, posted net profits of
Pta38.4bn in the first six months of this year, 4 per cent up on the first
half of 1992.
The bottom-line profit came after putting aside Pta38.1bn for provisions, 84
per cent more than at the six-month stage last year.
Mr Amusategui, who took over the reins of the bank late last year and has
since reshuffled its senior management, said BCH would this year easily
improve on 1992's net income.
Mr Amusategui said that on the advice of Merrill Lynch, the US investment
bank, BCH intended to place 2m shares, representing just under 1 per cent of
its share capital, on the international markets.
The offering, worth Pta6.9bn at Madrid market prices involves shares held by
Dragados, the BCH-controlled construction company.
The decision to offer bank shares follows a series of favourable reports by
financial houses, including Merrill Lynch, on a prospective turnround at
BCH. Mr Amusategui said it was useful for the bank to present itself on the
international markets.

FT  10 JUL 93 / International Company News: Agusta losses widen to L858bn

AGUSTA, the Italian helicopters group which is part of the Efim state
holding company in liquidation, saw losses increase sharply to L858bn
(Dollars 579m) last year, up from L182bn in 1991.
It lost almost one lira for every lira received in sales which amounted to
L937bn, up 39 per cent on 1991.
Agusta's losses lend weight to the view that it represents the most serious
of Efim's problems.
The company is being run by Finmeccanica, the state-controlled engineering
and aerospace concern, pending a final decision on its fate.
Agusta, which collaborates with Westland of the UK on the EH101 helicopter
project, said its order book was worth L4,800bn.
Gross operating profits were L41bn last year. However, earnings had been
affected by heavy debts, high interest rates and currency movements.
Agusta's net indebtedness amounted to about L280bn last year.
The company lost about L180bn because of currency factors linked to the fall
in the lira's value. About L50bn was written off to cover early retirements,
with the workforce falling by more than 1,500 people to 6,826, while other
unspecified losses amounted to L260bn.
Merloni, the Italian white goods group best known for its Ariston brand, has
taken majority control of two Turkish white goods producers owned by the
Vestel group.
The acquisition follows the purchase in June 1992 of an opening 25 per cent
stake in the companies, along with options to buy at least 26 per cent more
within two years.
Merloni is paying Dollars 8.5m for a further 29 per cent of Pekel Teknik and
Pekel Pazarlama and is investing Dollars 14m in a Pekel Teknik rights issue.

FT  10 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture (Week in the Markets): Gold
slips after stalling at Dollars 400
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOLD price slipped back towards the end of the week after twice failing
to breach strong resistance at Dollars 400 a troy ounce. And it took the
other precious metals with it.
The attempts at the Dollars 400-an-ounce hurdle were made on Wednesday and
Thursday and the first came closest to succeding, the price peaking at a
post-Gulf War high of Dollars 399.50 an ounce. The following day's advance
ran out of steam at Dollars 399.30 an ounce.
Both failures prompted sharpish retreats and the second seemed to have
knocked the stuffing out of the bull market. Further selling yesterday took
the price down to Dollars 392.75 an ounce, and although that was still
Dollars 2.75 up on the week dealers were generally in agreement that a
nervously bearish tone had replaced the confidence that the market had
maintained in recent weeks, even in the face of temporary setbacks.
'There weren't too many buyers around yesterday (Thursday) and those that
were sold this morning,' one dealer told the Reuter news agency yesterday.
Gold's ups and downs were shadowed by the other leading precious metals.
Silver climbed to Dollars 5.08 1/2 an ounce before settling back to Dollars
5.03 1/2 , up 11 cents on the week, while the platinum price was fixed in
London yesterday afternoon at Dollars 403 an ounce, down Dollars 5 on the
day but still Dollars 8 up on the week.
Palladium had been out-shining the other precious metals in recent weeks as
its price was boosted to a four-year high in response to strong physical
demand from Japanese and US electrical goods manufacturers and worries about
Russian supplies. But some of the froth was skimmed off this week and the
price was fixed yesterday at Dollars 135.75 an ounce, Dollars 10.25 below
last Friday's peak.
Like gold, the copper market has been chasing successive upside technical
targets in recent weeks, in defiance of a fundamental picture that looks
unequivocally bearish. Having broken resistance at Dollars 1,900 a tonne for
the three months delivery position last week London Metal Exchange traders
this week set their sights on the Dollars 2,000-a-tonne barrier. Apart from
an options-related bear raid in mid-week, the traffic was all one-way until
that goal was reached yesterday morning. But after forcing the price to
Dollars 2,020 a tonne the buyers appeared to decide that enough was enough.
Profit-taking set in as investors were reminded by a sharp rise in LME
warehouse stocks that fundamentals had changed little since the market
bottomed in April at Dollars 1,705 a tonne. Analysts are unanimous that
supply will continue to outstrip demand this year and professions of concern
about production problems at Chile's Codelco and labour contract
negotiations in the US have a hollow ring.
The technical nature of the latest bull move was underlined, moreover, by
the fact that the New York market stopped short of the round figure of 90
cents a lb, while the LME pushed on to the even rounder figure of Dollars
2,000 a tonne, equivalent to 90.75 cents a lb.
Other LME markets were weaker as economic gloom weighed down prices. Nickel
prices hit six-year lows and lead prices seven-year lows.
Sentiment deteriorated on the aluminium market in the continued absence of
follow-up news from other producers following Aluminum Company of America's
recent announcement of further big production cuts. Three months aluminium
closed yesterday at Dollars 1,244.50 a tonne, down Dollars 18 on the week.
The oil market was also in a decidedly downbeat mood. Concern about the
possibility of the Iraq/UN talks in New York resulting in a one-off sale of
Dollars 1.6bn-worth of crude to finance humanitarian aid put further
pressure on a market that was already struggling under the weight of
overproduction by other members of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting
Countries.
At the London International Petroleum Exchange the nearby August delivery
position dipped to Dollars 16.50 on Thursday, the lowest level for the
nearby position since February 1991. It steadied slightly yesterday to reach
Dollars 16.58 in late trading, but that was still 16 cents down on the week.
At the renamed London Commodity Exchange robusta coffee futures put in the
strongest performance since mid-May after being given a flying start by news
of agreement over the weekend by Latin American producers to withhold 20 per
cent of their exports from the start of October - although some analysts
were dubious about the likely effectiveness of the scheme. And the market
finished with its tail up as prices were given an extra lift yesterday by
reports that frost was possible in Brazilian growing areas this weekend.
The first factor helped to lift the September delivery position to Dollars
1,000 a tonne at one point, and the second encouraged the reversal of a
subsequent fall. The price ended yesterday at Dollars 982 a tonne, up
Dollars 54 on the week.
After a quiet week cocoa futures moved up quite sharply yesterday, the
September position closing at Pounds 764 a tonne, up Pounds 17 on the day.
Dealers attributed the rise to good buying interest in New York, which
allowed the market to break upside resistance.
June turnover in the London cocoa market was up 84 per cent from the same
month last year at 222,691 lots (10 tonnes each), the LCE announced this
week. That helped to lifted overall LCE June turnover by 40 per cent to
337,513 lots.

FT  10 JUL 93 / UK Company News: BOC makes German buy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOC Group, the industrial gases company, yesterday announced that it had
acquired the hydrogen distribution business of Huls, a subsidiary of the
Veba Group of Germany.
The move is part of the strategy of Mr Pat Rich, BOC chairman, to expand in
continental Europe and South America. BOC's shares closed down 2p at 657p.
The business includes the longest hydrogen pipeline in Europe, extending
more than 210km through the Rhine-Ruhr area and serving customers in both
oil refining and chemicals. It also includes a cylinder and trailer filling
station for hydrogen, methane and ethylene at Marl, near Munster.
Financial details were not provided. However, BOC said the consideration
would be less than Pounds 78m. It is understood the sum is greater than
Pounds 50m.
The amount should be settled in cash on completion, expected in mid-July.
The deal has the agreement of the German competition authorities.
BOC said the business should make a positive contribution to earnings within
a year as demand for hydrogen was robust and continued to grow. The company
expects long-term demand growth to average at about 5 per cent a year.
BOC said the business would make a substantial addition to its continental
operations whose turnover last year was about Pounds 140m. Group turnover
was about Pounds 2.8bn.
Huls will continue to manufacture hydrogen for BOC and operate the filling
station. No redundancies at Huls are involved. Goldman Sachs advised the
German company.
Mr Chung Kong Chow, BOC Gases' chief executive, said: 'This acquisition is a
unique opportunity to broaden our product range in a major industrial gas
market. It will complement our existing gases business in continental Europe
and is a significant step in the expansion of our hydrogen business around
the world.'

FT  10 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Evered Bardon moves to reduce borrowings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EVERED BARDON, the international building materials group, has been forced
to reduce its Pounds 300m debt mountain with a Pounds 72m rights issue and a
private placement of US loan notes worth Dollars 72m.
Shares in Evered Bardon closed down 5p at 48p after it announced the 1-for-2
rights issue, priced at 40p per share.
The group also said it would make an exceptional write-down of Pounds 60m in
the value of Civil &amp; Marine, the sea-dredged aggregates business which was
bought for Pounds 110m in 1990.
Talks are being held with a prospective buyer, but the group said it was
clear that the price achieved would be well below the current book value of
the business.
Mr William McGrath, finance director, said the proceeds of the rights issue
and placing would reduce the group's gearing from 90 per cent to 60 per
cent. The write-down on Civil &amp; Marine, which would be shown in the group's
results to June, would have risked breaching existing loan covenants.
Mr Peter Tom, chief executive, said that in spite of reduced costs and
improved efficiency in all the group's operations, debt remained too high,
and this had been constraining the business.
The company, which will change its name to Bardon Group, reflecting its
principal trading name in the UK and US, promised to maintain a 2p dividend
for 1993. It also forecast pre-tax profits of at least Pounds 300,000 in the
six months to June 30, before the exceptional provision on Civil &amp; Marine.
The present group is the result of a merger in 1991 of Bardon, which was
controlled by Mr Tom's family, and Evered, run by the Abdullah brothers.
Both companies had run up debts through expansion in the 1980s.
Mr Tom said: 'In the last two years, we have concentrated on consolidating
our position as a leading aggregates group in the UK and US, with
substantial strategic reserves and significant regional market shares.'
Bardon's workforce has been cut by 40 per cent to 2,000 people in the past
two years, and the group said it was now highly operationally geared to both
price and volume improvements.
The group will try to further reduce its debt through disposals or joint
ventures. It has raised Pounds 67m from disposals since the end of 1991 and
said a number of additional small disposals were under discussion.
Mr Tom said: 'There is no doubt that trading conditions in many of our
markets are now improving, with Massachusetts, in particular, enjoying
excellent levels of activity.
'Elsewhere in the group, the signs are encouraging and we are confident that
we can look forward to greatly improved prospects as we move into 1994 and
beyond.'

<TEXT>
Upton &amp; Southern Holdings, the Cleveland-based department store group,
reduced pre-tax losses from Pounds 2.86m to Pounds 635,000 in the 53 weeks
ended January 30 1993.
The new management provided a further Pounds 265,000 against completed and
ongoing property developments and Pounds 134,000 in redundancy costs.
Further closure costs of Pounds 190,000 were foreseen this year.
Mr Jim Hodkinson, the new chairman, said the business was being focused on
three Teesside department stores and three satellite retail units, with some
property interests.
He told shareholders: 'Over the coming year we plan to realise our property
interests to concentrate on our core retail business which is beginning to
perform well.'
In January the group raised Pounds 2.2m capital as part of a reorganisation
with its bankers.

FT  10 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Thos Cook looks to next summer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RESIGNATIONS this week at tour operator Owners Abroad leave the strategy
of travel agent Thomas Cook looking battered, writes Michael Skapinker.
Thomas Cook took a 21 per cent stake in Owners Abroad earlier this year as
part of the realignment of the industry which saw Airtours acquire retailers
Pickfords Travel and Hogg Robinson. Thomson has owned the Lunn Poly travel
outlet for 20 years.
While Thomson and Airtours seem pleased with this summer's prospects, this
week's events show that Owners Abroad was not. Mr Howard Klein, its outgoing
chairman, said on Thursday that the company's products were too expensive.
It was also trying to sell too many holidays to the sluggish eastern
Mediterranean market and not enough to Spain, which is benefiting from the
depreciation of the peseta.
How does Thomas Cook, which is owned by Westdeutsche Landesbank and the
German travel group LTU, feel about having a tour operator partner which, by
its own admission, has the wrong products at the wrong price?
Mr Christopher Rodrigues, Thomas Cook's chief executive and a non-executive
director of Owners Abroad, says that while the Owners management made
mistakes, the glory of the holiday business is that each summer presents a
new opportunity. Owners Abroad, he says, can get its holidays right next
year, helped by Thomas Cook's intelligence on what is selling and what is
not.
It is true that tour operators can attack new destinations if the previous
year's offerings failed to sell. The problem has always been that others can
do so as well.
The difference over previous years is that the largest tour companies have a
guaranteed retail outlet for their holidays. Owners Abroad sales through
Thomas Cook are up 30 per cent on last summer.
A rejuvenated Owners Abroad will therefore be in a better position to
recover than an independent operator which made mistakes. That assumes,
however, that tour operators continue to be allowed to use their retailers
in the way they are now doing. As the Office of Fair Trading is
investigating these links that might be a dangerous assumption.

FT  10 JUL 93 / UK Company News: BAe set to conclude Taiwan venture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Aerospace appears set to conclude its Pounds 250m joint venture with
Taiwan Aerospace Corporation at the end of this month, following reports
that the Taipei government has offered a Dollars 250m (Pounds 166m)
interest-free loan to help develop new aircraft models.
BAe refused to comment on the reported loan offer for the regional jet
manufacturing and leasing joint venture. However, the company said it was
happy that 'negotiations were coming to a conclusion and that everything was
on course'.
In recent weeks, with little sign of movement from either BAe or TAC, there
have been fears of protracted delays. Speculation centred on difficulties
over the provision of leasing finance by state-owned Taiwanese banks to TAC.
Both partners must get bank guarantees to cover finance for leasing
aircraft.
However, the development loan from the Taiwan government appears to have
dampened any fears. 'It has got to be good news,' said one analyst. The
state's offer was likely to mean that the Taiwanese banks would soon come
into line on lease finance.
BAe and TAC, which is 29 per cent owned by the Taiwan government, signed a
joint venture deal at the beginning of the year to manufacture and lease RJ
passenger jets.
The loan of between Dollars 250m and Dollars 300m would be for the
development of an advanced RJ jet, the RJX. Total costs of developing the
RJX have been estimated at Dollars 1bn.
The current aircraft will be manufactured for at least three years at BAe's
UK factories, saving some 3,000 jobs.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
MR JONATHAN CRYSTAL yesterday tendered his resignation from the board of
Tottenham Hotspur's football club. His resignation, which becomes effective
on November 4, was accepted by the Tottenham board chaired by Mr Alan Sugar.
Mr Crystal is the only remaining director who supports Mr Terry Venables,
Tottenham Hotspur's former chief executive who was sacked by Mr Sugar
following their bitter court battle over control of the London club.
Earlier this week it emerged that Mr Sugar, who owns 47 per cent of the
company, was considering calling an extraordinary meeting in an attempt to
force Mr Crystal off the board. No date had been set but it could have taken
place at the end of this month.
A move against Mr Crystal had been expected. The barrister had been a solid
Venables supporter and Mr Sugar had publicly blamed Mr Venables'
relationship with Mr Crystal for the turmoil at the club and had invited him
to resign.
Mr Sugar also wants to force Mr Venables out of the company, but has
undertaken not to oust the former chief executive from the board until High
Court hearings over their dispute are completed.
Mr Crystal's resignation will probably be seen as a victory for Mr Sugar.
However, by tendering his resignation but delaying the date it becomes
effective, Mr Crystal may have secured a few more months on the board.

FT  10 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Securiguard recommends Rentokil bid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RENTOKIL'S improved and final Pounds 75.7m offer for Securiguard was assured
of success yesterday after it was recommended by the board of the security
and cleaning company.
Rentokil, the environmental and property services group, bought 29.7 per
cent of Securiguard last week when it lifted its bid to 345p per share.
Securiguard directors also said they would accept the offer in respect of
their own 8 per cent stake in the com-pany.
Mr Clive Thompson, chief executive of Rentokil, said he was delighted with
the recommendation: 'We intend to develop extensively Securiguard's
businesses and therefore believe that the opportunities and prospects for
Securiguard's employees will be much improved within Rentokil.'
Securiguard's board said it believed that uncertainty over the future
ownership could damage the business by adversely affecting both customers
and staff.
This could prevent the company taking advantage of opportunities and have an
impact on shareholders. Against this background, the board believed the
final offer fully valued Securi-guard.
Securiguard said it had been assured that Rentokil intended to retain the
separate identity of Securiguard's busi-nesses and had no plans to dispose
of any of its core businesses.
Mr Alan Baldwin, Securiguard's chairman, and Mr Peter Dunckley, the finance
director, agreed to stay on as directors for a further six months to effect
a smooth handover.
Rentokil has asked the other executive directors to continue in their roles.

FT  10 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Rolls-Royce plans Chinese move
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ROLLS-ROYCE Motor Cars is planning to appoint a distributor in China later
this year, and will open a dealership in Moscow later this month, as part of
an export sales drive to return the Vickers subsidiary to profit.
Higher sales in export markets beyond western Europe are offsetting this
year's steep decline in continental European new car markets, leaving the
Crewe-based luxury car maker on course to return to profitability by the end
of this year, the company said yesterday.
Rolls-Royce has been drastically restructured over the past two and a half
years, with its workforce reduced from 5,500 to less than 2,500 and its
production break-even level halved to 1,300 cars a year.
However, last year's output totalled only 1,258 cars. And with restructuring
still going on during the first half of 1992, Rolls-Royce incurred a trading
loss of more than Pounds 20m. Retail sales world-wide fell by 20 per cent to
1,378, from 1,713 the year previously and more than 3,300 at the end of the
1980s.
Production is now being increased by about 25 per cent, partly for seasonal
reasons - Rolls's second-half sales are traditionally higher than in the
first - and partly to cater for the higher export demand.
Even so, the company's output was down a further 14.2 per cent in the first
four months of the year, at 359 compared with 418 in the 1992 period. On
this basis, an output increase of more than 25 per cent would be needed to
exceed the 1,300 breakeven figure.

38,000
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
British Bloodstock Agency cut its loss from Pounds 55,000 to Pounds 38,000
in the year to end-March.
The trading improvement, however, was Pounds 370,000 as the previous year
took in Pounds 353,000 profit on property disposal. It had been achieved
notwithstanding continued policy of prudent provision for doubtful debts and
a further writing down of stallion shares.
Costs had been cut by Pounds 1m since 1990 and further savings would be
sought to assist a return to profitability and dividends as soon as
possible. Losses per share were 1.4p, against 3p.

as half-time profits have expanded 51 per cent.
For the six months ended March 31 1993 the pre-tax outcome was Pounds
783,000 (Pounds 518,000) from turnover of Pounds 13.1m (Pounds 13.9m).

Operating profit rose to Pounds 1.15m (Pounds 980,000) while interest
charges were reduced by Pounds 83,000 to Pounds 383,000.
Mr Phillip Dovey, managing director, was 'particularly pleased' with
operating profit in the building products division in view of the difficult
trading conditions.
That operation contributed Pounds 122,000 (Pounds 17,000). In other
activities leisure and fitness accounted for Pounds 650,000 (Pounds

FT  10 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Latham Pounds 2.21m in the red
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
JAMES LATHAM, the timber importer and building materials merchant, reported
a pre-tax deficit of Pounds 2.21m for the year to end-March.
The outcome compared with losses of Pounds 612,000 last time and came from
turnover up from Pounds 59.6m to Pounds 60.8m.
The increased loss was due to a Pounds 1.89m exceptional charge relating to
property write-downs, ongoing rents for closed branches and a further sum to
cover historic pension arrangements not related to the pension fund.
Interest charges fell slightly, from Pounds 1.35m to Pounds 1.13m, and the
company said that to reduce borrowings, further property disposals were
envisaged.
Losses per share came out at 43.9p (8.7p). There is no final dividend
leaving a total for the year of 1.5p (3.75p).

FT  10 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Pounds 37m loss at Brown &amp; Tawse
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES IN Brown &amp; Tawse fell 19p to 44p yesterday as the steel and pipes
distributor revealed pre-tax losses greater than had been forecast in the
profits warning in March when the group announced a recovery plan involving
a management shake-up, the disposal of peripheral businesses and widescale
restructuring of the core.
Losses of Pounds 19.8m had then been anticipated after provisions - in the
event they were increased firstly by a charge of Pounds 14.8m struck under
FRS 3 for goodwill and provisions for disposals and secondly by further
provisions relating to 'additional computer costs, stock obsolescence and
poor purchase ledger controls' in Brown &amp; Tawse Ltd, the main subsidiary.
In total, losses for the year to March 28 emerged at Pounds 36.5m pre-tax.
The board's last links with the past were erased yesterday when Mr Ian
Harding replaced Mr Phillip Ashworth as finance director. Mr Richard Wilson,
brought in from GKN as chief executive in September, said that when a
company had been 'badly managed or non-managed for as many years as B&amp;T had
been, it takes time to clear it up . . . but everyone has done as thorough a
job as could have been done in the situation'.
Jay Fasteners, which had profits of Pounds 73,000, sales of Pounds 6.9m and
net assets of Pounds 1.6m, has been sold to Lilleshall for Pounds 2.9m. Mr
Wilson hopes to sell Pipe &amp; Tube Group (sales of Pounds 12m and net assets
of Pounds 4.5m) and Stauff Group (Pounds 9m and Pounds 3m) soon.
He said that the adoption of FRS 3 stemmed from the decision the board had
made to sell those companies.
Above the line there was a Pounds 5.64m exceptional write-off of the
'disastrous' information systems computer, and Pounds 6.06m reorganisation
costs.
Turnover came to Pounds 119m (Pounds 139.4m) and operating losses were
Pounds 7.46m (profits Pounds 1.82m). Losses per share leapt to 111.2p (2.7p)
and there is no dividend (4.7p total last year).

FT  10 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Helical Bar raising Pounds 20m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HELICAL BAR, the London-based property investment, development and trading
group, announces plans to raise Pounds 20m net through a rights issue of
28.9m cumulative convertible redeemable preference shares.
Proceeds of the issue, which is underwritten by Credit Lyonnais Laing, will
be used to invest in higher yielding properties and to take advantage of
trading opportunities. Helical said the additional liquidity would enable it
to continue to respond quickly to these opportunities.
The group, which is currently in negotiation to acquire residential,
industrial and retail properties valued at about Pounds 25m, added that it
views the remainder of the year 'with optimism,' and expects to increase the
total ordinary dividend by about 20 per cent.
Last year the group also boosted its dividend by 20 per cent to 4.8p after
reporting a profit turnaround. The ordinary share price closed up 10p
yesterday at 236p.
Helical raised Pounds 19m through a convertible preference share issue in
October 1987. Under the terms of the latest proposal shareholders will be
offered the new 5.25p net convertible preference shares 2012 of 70p each at
72p per share on the basis of 7-for-5 ordinary and 1-for-2.785 existing
convertible preference shares. They were unchanged at 85p.
In addition the group is proposing a capital reorganisation which would
change the rights of the existing 5.25p cumulative convertible redeemable
preference shares 2012 of Pounds 1 each, to ensure that the rights of the
new and existing convertible preference shares will be identical.
Dealings should start on August 3.

FT  10 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Stratagem to acquire Harrison Industries
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
STRATAGEM, which is engaged in computer maintenance, retail car sales and
runs an investment portfolio, has agreed terms for the acquisition of
Harrison Industries. The share exchange basis values Harrison at Pounds 7.4m
with a cash alternative at Pounds 5.1m.
Stratagem has been seeking a presence in the manufacturing sector since 1991
and feels Harrison, which makes industrial and domestic garage doors and
related equipment, will benefit from added financial resources and a further
strengthening of management.
After several years of losses at Harrison it believes there is considerable
scope for recovery.
To help meet the cash alternative and fund working capital requirements of
the enlarged group, Stratagem is raising Pounds 7.9m net in a placing and
open offer, which shareholders can take up on the basis of 9-for-10 at 125p
per share. Yesterday the shares rose 5p to 142p.
Terms of the acquisition are one Stratagem share for every 23 in Harrison,
valuing each Harrison at 5.96p against 5p in the market on Thursday. The
cash alternative is worth 4.1p.
Stratagem already owns 25.07 per cent of Harrison and has received
undertakings which will bring its holding up to 50.12 per cent. The
acquisition and placing shares will represent 59 per cent of the enlarged
capital and approval of Stratagem shareholders will be needed.
A month ago Stratagem reported a turnround from losses of Pounds 221,000 to
profits of Pounds 272,000 for the half year ended February 28 1993.
Yesterday, Harrison announced a loss of Pounds 3.82m for the year ended
March 31 1993 against a deficit of Pounds 908,000 for the previous 15
months, which included a Pounds 1.2m provision for reorganisation in
industrial doors and a Pounds 900,000 property write-down.
Industrial doors, architectural ironmongery and builders' hardware
companies, which represented more than 60 per cent of turnover of Pounds
51.4m, suffered from greatly reduced activity levels.

FT  10 JUL 93 / UK Company News: A fall from defending heights - Why the
Panel is to investigate Owners Abroad
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TAKEOVER Panel yesterday confirmed it would investigate Owners Abroad
after the holiday company's dramatic profits warning on Thursday. It has a
simple brief.
First of all, it will focus on whether representations made by Owners Abroad
and its City advisers accurately reflected the state of the company's
business at the time of the bid.
Apart from factual accuracy, it will also assess whether any facts were
omitted that could have foreshadowed the statement that Owners Abroad's
profits would reach only half the level expected at the time of the bid.
At its simplest, the investigation will need to answer how a business - even
one as volatile as the holiday tour business - could go quite so wrong only
four months after Owners had said the group was having a record year.
Throughout the bid Owners and Airtours traded statistics designed to show
that they were gaining market share or that they were significantly ahead of
the previous year's levels.
Statistical support was deployed in such abundance that some institutions,
even at the climax of the bid, admitted they simply did not know the true
picture or who to believe. What most shareholders heard loud and clear from
Owners Abroad, however, was that the trend of the defending company's
trading was sharply upwards, from a poor previous year, and that there was
no hint of the profits collapse that has now emerged.
When Owners Abroad in one of its last defence documents said it would
increase its full year 1993 dividend by 43 per cent to 5p, this was seen as
no more than confirmation of the bullish trading statements they had heard
to date.
Owners Abroad and Samuel Montagu, its advisers, were at pains on Thursday to
say that no profits forecast was actually made during the bid. Formally this
is also the Takeover Panel's position. Dividend forecasts, the panel says,
do not constitute formal earnings forecasts.
But investors immediately worked out that a 5p dividend, if covered about
twice by earnings, implied profits of about Pounds 27m, the level the market
was expecting until Thursday's announcement.
There is one compelling reason for believing the board did not foresee the
problems that emerged this week. Had the Owners board recommended Airtours'
offer - as indeed it was on the verge of doing late in the bid - the board
members would have made a personal profit of Pounds 20m on shares they
owned. As things have transpired, their stakes are now worth about half that
now, leaving much of their personal wealth tied up in a company with a
questionable future.
Institutions were therefore suspecting that Owners Abroad's troubles
resulted from a management that simply lost control of the business. Having
bought too many beds in the wrong resorts at the wrong prices, Owners has
been hit by a rapid erosion of margins - an inevitable consequence of making
mistakes when operational gearing is as high as it is in the holiday
business.
It seems that the holiday industry has confirmed, once again, why it
deserves such a low stock market rating.

FT  10 JUL 93 / Letter: No justification for US unilateral military attack
against Iraq
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr HOWARD N MEYER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, While appreciating assertively pro-American Mr Joe Rogaly's critique of
the attack on Baghdad ('Sad about Uncle Sam', June 29), one regrets he did
not articulate the principal basis for a reasoned critique of the decision
and action, though he came very close.
Simply put, the US unilateral military action, explained under the pretext
of being 'self defence', was plainly, in the eyes of any reasonable person,
not that at all. As I summarised State Secretary Daniel Webster's letter to
Lord Palmerston, 150 years ago, in the case of The Caroline (in my book, The
Century of the World Court) there must be (a) instant, overwhelming
necessity; (b) no alternative choice of means; (c) a necessity to avoid
deliberative processes.
These lacking, the president's action was clearly illegal, a point,
regrettably, made nowhere in the US media save by Professor Alfred Rubin on
National Public Radio's 'Talk of the Nation'. Howard N Meyer,

FT  10 JUL 93 / Letter: Long hours not necessarily smart hours
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PAUL WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, You rightly highlight the serious social consequences of long working
hours ('Macho Managers', July 3). However, the equally serious problem is
the damage they inflict on the UK's already appalling competitive situation.
The debate as a whole is completely on the wrong tack and obscured by the
ambiguity of one government arm describing average 55-hour weeks as
'outrageous' while another fights in the European trenches for 48-hours.
The reality is that working harder (meaning longer) may assuage job-fears,
may be macho, may even be the last twinge of the Puritan mind. However, it
is counter-productive to real output, as any serious research demonstrates.
Worse still, as my own experience as a Girobank general manager and
subsequently at XTAQ confirms, upwards of 20 per cent of the remaining truly
'productive' time is continuously misapplied in unnecessary, or poorly
handled, work. This is true from top to bottom of most organisations, with
breathtaking implications for UK plc's bottom-line.
So the awful truth: after decades of worrying about investment, trades
unions, technology and any other excuse we can lay our hands on, our
international competitors still work smarter and shorter hours.
There is no magic to this and, thankfully, the good news is that structured
solutions are available, applied and working very successfully.
The question is whether our culture can cope with a new hero: the man
leaving on time, his tasks successfully and effectively complete. Or must he
remain the last man at his desk, groaning over his overflowing filing trays?

FT  10 JUL 93 / Letter: Cause of low-grade jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr R S MUSGRAVE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Richard Seager suggests (Letters, July 1) that labour market
flexibility in the US has reduced unemployment but has also led to low grade
jobs, and that Europe should be wary of this flexibility.
I am baffled as to how labour market flexibility in itself stops an employer
creating a high grade job. The truth is that such flexibility merely reduces
unemployment, and that is all its advocates claim for it.
As to the real wage or 'grade' of work done, this is determined by a range
of factors such as technical competence - where the US has lost much of its
lead to Japan. Another factor is terms of trade, where the US has also lost
out. It is the deterioration of these factors, not labour market
flexibility, that explains the US's relative decline.

<TEXT>
Sir, H N Harrison's letter (June 2) about the 83 per cent increase in the
charge for recorded delivery is only half the story.
The Post Office has also increased the price of registered post from Pounds
1.90 to Pounds 3, while at the same time reducing the insurance cover
provided - from Pounds 950 to Pounds 500. For those of us who regularly use
the service, this represents a whopping 200 per cent increase in the cost of
insurance per Pounds covered.

FT  10 JUL 93 / On the beach, they take it as read
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
What books will Britain's chairmen and chief executives be taking on holiday
this summer, asks Charles Batchelor. Political biography, histories and
novels head the list. It will probably come as no surprise that management
volumes do not make the grade. Clear winners are John le Carre, with his spy
thriller The Night Manager, James Clavell's Gai-Jin, and Jeffrey Archer's
Honour Among Thieves. The most frequently mentioned title not quite to make
the holiday suitcase? Without a doubt Nigel Lawson's The View From No 11.
Many executives are 'wading through', or 'dipping into' it, but it appears
to be just too bulky to make the trip.
A bag of books, most of them 'hefty tomes', accompanies Sir Denys Henderson,
chairman of ICI. The subjects are mainly biographical but with what Sir
Denys calls 'faction' thrown in. He hopes to finish the Diaries of Alan
Clarke, the former defence minister, which he is already halfway through and
which he describes as a 'light read'. Next in line is Truman, a biography of
former US president Harry Truman by David McCullough, bought in a New York
bookshop. Lighter relief comes in the shape of Gai-Jin, James Clavell's
1,000-plus-page account of the European powers' attempts to open up
19th-century Japan.
'Good escapism' is the essential characteristic required by Ewen Macpherson,
chief executive of 3i, the UK's largest venture capital company, which has
made news in recent months with its on-off plans for a public flotation.
Macpherson will be taking Le Carre's The Night Manager and Jeffrey Archer's
Honour Among Thieves with him on his annual Scottish fishing break, where he
catches up on leisure reading. A book which has attracted his interest is
The View from No 11, Nigel Lawson's account of his years as chancellor of
the exchequer. 'I've been dipping in and out of it but I have not yet
settled down,' says Macpherson.
Alastair Ross Goobey, chief executive of Postel, the UK's largest pension
fund, is a fan of the English classic novel, an enthusiasm he shares with
his wife. They like to choose a title jointly and discuss it afterwards,
with the characters fresh in their minds. Dickens's Hard Times is this
year's choice, perhaps an appropriate title for an investment manager at the
end of a deep recession. This will be joined by Fatherland, Robert Harris's
thriller set against the background of a victorious Third Reich. Ross Goobey
will also be taking John Carswell's South Sea Bubble, a recent reissue of
the story of the famous stock market scandal.
Stanley Kalms, chairman of Dixons Group, is methodical. He has selected
books in three categories - 'political history, popular stuff, and
mind-improving' - for his planned three-week break. Under the first category
he has selected John Campbell's Edward Heath, a biography, and Portraits and
Miniatures, by Roy Jenkins, a founder of the Social Democrats, whose style
he admires. The popular selection includes Jeffrey Archer's latest thriller,
Honour Among Thieves. In the mind-improving section, Kalms has set aside One
People, a study of the different strands in the Jewish community by Jonathan
Sachs, the chief rabbi.
Sir David Scholey, chairman of S G Warburg, the merchant banking group, says
he 'builds up a pile to be read and then see how far I can get through it'.
On his list is Tolstoy's Anna Karenina, which he last read as a schoolboy
and which a friend has recommended as a good guide to understanding what is
happening in Russia today. He has also chosen Le Carre's The Night Manager
for light relief. He looks forward to what he believes will be a 'splendidly
convoluted' tale. For a more factual account of recent history he has
selected Turmoil and Triumph, the memoirs of George Schultz, former US
secretary of state.
George Bain, principal of the London Business School, will read books he has
set aside specially and others already half completed. There is a strong
historical thread to the group, Part-read is Joe Lee's Ireland 1912-1985, an
historical work with a personal resonance because of Bain's Belfast mother.
This will be joined by Correlli Barnett's Engage the Enemy More Closely, not
a reference to Insead, the rival French-based business school, Bain jokes,
but a history of the Royal Navy, in which he served. The historical theme is
completed by Under an Open Sky, by William Cronon, a collection of essays on
the American west.
If Sir Simon Hornby, chairman and chief executive of W H Smith, were taking
a holiday, a Trollope novel would be in his suitcase. A rapid and voracious
reader, Sir Simon, a member of the Trollope Society, is working his way
through the author's entire output. Not that such dedication confers
unreserved pleasure. The Macdermots of Ballycloran, Trollope's first novel
and the most recent on Sir Simon's list was 'a boring book, almost
unreadable', he says. Sir Simon reads mainly novels. 'I don't want to be
bothered with other things.' An exception is Jean Genet, Edmund White's life
of the French novelist and dramatist.

FT  10 JUL 93 / Letter: Profit in national pride
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr BRIAN H GILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your leader, 'Defence of the nation' (July 6), was, as one expects,
cool, clear, calm and objective. However, I must take issue with one comment
you make: that 'a romantic view of (Britain's) past' should not be the
guiding principle of UK defence commitments.
Th fundamental flaw is that such a statement ignores the as-yet
unquantifiable 'profit' that a nation derives from pride in itself. It is
clear from the substantial coverage that the tabloid press gives to the way
that 'our boys are the best/bravest. . .' that the constituency that takes
pride in the actions and achievements of the UK armed forces in 'far-flung
trouble spots' is not made up solely of what one might term 'ageing
half-colonels in the home counties'.
I hold no brief for the tabloid readership, but it does seem to me that
pride in our armed forces and their achievements is one of the things (alas
all too few these days) that enhances our fellow countrymen's psychological
well-being. This crucial aspect is, of course, unfortunately (and wrongly)
not included as a 'credit' in the balance sheets generated by the Treasury's
all-knowing computer]

FT  10 JUL 93 / If you protest in the woods today . . .: The implications of
an environmental victory
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM KING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For one glorious moment this week, the UK's environmentalists thought they
had witnessed the unimaginable: the greening of the Department of Transport.
In a move that took almost everyone by surprise, the government tore up
long-standing plans to build a new crossing over the Thames in Greenwich,
south-east London, because one of the approach roads would have cut through
a clump of old and much-loved trees.
Conservationists were astonished. In Britain, as in many other countries,
protesting against unpopular road schemes is a national pastime, but few who
indulge in it do so with any expectation of success. The Department of
Transport is nicknamed the Department of Roads, and it is axiomatic in the
roadbuilding business that, given a choice between the economic benefits
conferred by a new motorway and the environmental benefits conferred by a
local beauty spot, the economic arguments tend to prevail.
So what went wrong with Oxleas Wood? True, some might have though it a pity
to see one of London's last pieces of ancient woodland disappear under a few
thousand tonnes of Tarmac. But as far as the department was concerned, plans
for an East London River Crossing dated back to the Abercrombie Plan to
rebuild London after the last war, and the Pounds 283m project would have
formed a long-overdue and badly needed link between the London-Dover road
and the capital's North Circular orbital road.
Part of the explanation for the turnabout must lie in the sheer doggedness
of the protestors. Led by a campaigning group called People Against the
River Crossing, their story is one of a prolonged and bloody-minded refusal
to be defeated.
The group itself came into being when the first public inquiry into the
scheme was held between September 1985 and December 1986. In 1989, it
complained to the European Commission that the UK government had not carried
out a proper environmental assessment of the scheme. (The case has yet to be
heard.) In 1990, when the road scheme was altered, a second public inquiry
was held. In 1992, nine local campaigners challenged the scheme in the High
Court; and when the judgment went against them earlier this year, they took
the matter to the Court of Appeal, where it was due to be heard in November
1993.
Dot Lawrence, the group's 66-year-old secretary, says the Oxleas Wood
campaign has taken over her life. Her garage and two bedrooms of her
three-bedroom house are filled with paraphernalia from the campaign: papers,
leaflets, T-shirts, maps. She says: 'I was a very minor person in the
campaign at the beginning, looking after my mother and a job. I still don't
understand a lot of it. As you grow up with it, you know more, you become
more self-confident. In the end you start to live the whole damn thing.'
Parc chairman Dr Barry Gray, a hospital consultant, attributes the group's
success to perseverance and determination. It was, he believes, essential to
have a hard core of 40 activists, who would outlast hundreds of other
supporters whose interest was less constant, and the support of the local
authority, Greenwich Council, which spent Pounds 1.5m pounds on fighting the
scheme in public inquiries and the courts.
Oxleas Wood gave a peculiar character to this planning dispute. Although
opponents of the road scheme were also concerned about the proposed
demolition of 240 homes, about the loss of other open spaces and about noise
and air pollution, they focused attention on the wood itself.
With emphasis on the rich diversity of species in the woodland, the
campaigners succeeded in persuading national environmental organisations
such as Friends of the Earth to give unprecedented backing to a specific,
local campaign.
With the help of these national groups, the campaigners distributed
thousands of leaflets, asking people to pledge themselves to non-violent
direct action in a Beat the Bulldozer campaign. To the politicians and the
road lobby, that must have raised the frightening prospect of repeating the
scenes witnessed on the M3 construction site at Twyford Down, in Hampshire,
where earlier this month protestors staged a mass invasion.
Perhaps the last straw came in May when the British Road Federation, a
lobbying group which campaigns for more roadbuilding, swapped sides to join
the anti-road protestors. Suddenly, the government found there was virtually
no one left prepared to stand up and say they thought the road should go
ahead.
Mr Paul Everitt, the British Road Federation's assistant director, says his
organisation's move came out of a recognition that the scheme as proposed
would never be built in the face of such fierce opposition - particularly
since the site's location in London put it within easy reach of television
crews.
There was also, he adds, a sense of ritual sacrifice about the affair. 'For
many people it was a case of assuaging their guilt. They don't really like
to think of their driving as detrimental to the environment, so Oxleas Wood
was a symbol by which they would demonstrate their commitment to the
environment.'
All that apart, it is possible to read a slightly more political aspect into
the change of mind. It is not surprising that a government with a thin
parliamentary majority and a record low rating in the popularity polls
should back away from such an unpopular project.
There was also the matter of the EC's legal action against the government
initiated by People Against the River Crossing in 1989. The government
claims it was under no obligation to carry out an environmental assessment
of the road scheme under a 1985 EC directive because the scheme was already
in the pipeline when the directive was issued. But the government's case
looked shaky, and a defeat would have been a severe embarrassment.
It is also illuminating to consider the identity of the MP whose written
Commons question voicing concern over Oxleas Wood provided the peg for the
government's U-turn. Mr Peter Bottomley, the Conservative member for Eltham,
recently emerged as one of the ringleaders in a Tory backbench rebellion
over the government's controversial railway privatisation legislation. With
the Railways Bill facing its gruelling final passage through the Commons
after the summer recess, the government may now be hoping to find itself
with one fewer rebel.
How much significance the Oxleas Wood campaign holds for other planning
disputes is therefore open to debate. Environmental campaigners are already
drawing up a list of battles to fight over other sites but, in reality,
Oxleas Wood looks like an isolated case. Transport ministers, it seems, have
not gone green: they have merely gone pragmatic.

<TEXT>
Sir, The hearts of readers must be bleeding for your correspondent Mr R
Stewart of Ayr (Letters, July 3/4) who was apparently: (a) forced to become
a shareholder in a UK quoted company; and (b) unaware that the perusal of a
company's annual report will provide useful information on its accounting
and political policies.
In view of his strongly held opinion that 'it should be left to individuals
to decide to whom and by how much they wish to support any political party',
it would be unwise for him to move to Germany. Here, he would find that a
portion of any taxes he pays would be likely to be used to finance every
political party while, at the same time, he would be prohibited from voting
for any party at any level of election.

FT  10 JUL 93 / Sure-fire winner that went astray: The shooting of a
terrorist has exposed panic in the Kohl administration
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The carefully planned anti-terrorist operation around the little railway
station of Bad Kleinen, on the shores of Lake Schwerin in north-eastern
Germany, should have been a public relations triumph for the law-and-order
platform of Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
The capture of two left-wing terrorists, wanted for murder and attempted
murder and on the run for the past 10 years, was just the sort of coup
needed to revive public confidence in an ailing administration.
What happened in a blaze of gunfire on the stairs and platforms of the rural
railway station has turned instead into a potential new political disaster
for Mr Kohl and his coalition colleagues. It has already claimed the heads
of Mr Rudolf Seiters, the interior minister and a close confidant of the
chancellor, and of Mr Alexander von Stahl, the federal prosecutor. More
heads in the security services are confidently expected to roll.
And yet there is still no clear picture of precisely what happened at Bad
Kleinen 12 days ago, when more than 50 crack anti-terrorist police
surrounded the station cafe where Mr Wolfgang Grams and Ms Birgit Hogefeld,
both members of the Red Army Faction, were sitting down to a meal of
sausages and toasted Camembert.
All that is clear is that Ms Hogefeld was arrested, and Mr Grams was shot
dead in a furious gun battle with the police; one young policeman also died,
shot through the heart. But the suspicion has emerged that Grams may have
been shot in cold blood, when lying unarmed and wounded on the railway
tracks.
'That is a very serious allegation in Germany,' according to one
parliamentary expert on security matters. 'This is not the US. Ordinary
people are horrified, even if they abhor the Red Army faction.'
What has also emerged is a picture of muddle and panic at the heart of the
Kohl administration, and incoherence and confusion between the multiple arms
of the security services.
It is not so much what happened, but the failure to tell how it happened,
that has caused the political backlash.
So far the only person to emerge with any distinction has been Mr Seiters
himself, even though he resigned from office last Sunday without any
apparent reason for doing so. Moreover, he seems to have triggered a
probable domino-effect of resignations and dismissals, which could shatter
the leadership of Germany's security services. And yet his resignation is
praised on all sides of the political spectrum as honourable and desirable.
To the outside world, at least, it must all seem confusing. Inside Germany,
as usual, the only man who appears entirely unruffled is Mr Kohl himself. He
stayed in the country just long enough to appoint a new interior minister,
and then flew off to the Group of Seven summit in Tokyo.
The Bad Kleinen affair looks like yet another example of a self-inflicted
political scandal, suggesting a real crisis of leadership in the government,
underlining the bickering and gloom within the coalition, the absence of a
self-confident opposition, and the lack of co-ordination in key areas of the
administration. Mr Seiters is the ninth minister to resign, or be dismissed,
from the coalition cabinet since the beginning of last year.
The opposition Social Democrats can scarcely gloat. They have lost their
erstwhile leader, Mr Bjorn Engholm, leaving their electoral hopes in
disarray. Their fortunes are now pinned on the untried, and largely unknown,
figure of Mr Rudolf Scharping, the 45-year-old state premier of the
Rhineland-Palatinate.
Bad Kleinen could yet be the gift from the gods which Mr Scharping urgently
needs to revive his party's fortunes, and demonstrate the incompetence of Mr
Kohl's government. But until the facts are known, even that much is unclear.
The problem is that far too many security organisations seem to have had a
hand in the operation. The informer who tipped them off worked for the
internal security service, the prosecutor ordered the arrests, the federal
police were in charge of the operation and used the GSG-9 anti-terrorist
unit - part of the border police - to do it. All are responsible to
different masters.
'The very system was designed to be a bit inefficient, thanks to memories of
the Gestapo and Nazi centralised rule,' according to one foreign observer.
'What we have seen is that it more or less lives up to expectations.'
The fact that Mr Seiters quit is seen as a personal vote of no confidence in
Mr Kohl and his cabinet, rather than a necessary sacrifice. 'He was tired of
the bickering, and his heart was not in the battle,' according to one senior
official.
And yet Mr Kohl has managed to use Mr Seiters' resignation to advantage. He
has brought into the government a stern advocate of law and order, Mr
Manfred Kanther, leader of his Christian Democratic Union in Hesse, who
could well bolster the platform in next year's elections.
Mr Kanther is no shrinking violet. He has been a sharp critic of the chaos
in Bonn, while sitting out in the provinces. Mr Kohl is seeking to exploit
his reputation as a staunch member of the party's 'conservative-nationalist'
wing and silence a potential critic.
It is the sort of political trick at which the chancellor is a past master.
Yet time is running out for political tricks. Mr Kohl desperately needs to
prove that he heads an administration capable of coherent government - and
ensuring law and order. That is precisely what the events at Bad Kleinen
have undermined.

FT  10 JUL 93 / Man in the News: Free-wheeling Olympian - Lord Justice Scott
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS and ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Senior UK civil servants are not accustomed to being grilled in public. But
such was the fate this week of the hitherto unflappable Peter Verker, head
of arms control and disarmament at the Foreign Office when he gave evidence
before Lord Justice Scott's inquiry into arms sales to Iraq.
Mr Vereker had suggested it was irrelevant to the inquiry that Jordan had
been left off a government blacklist despite evidence it was an important
route for arms supplies. The judge was unconvinced.
'Where Jordan should be  - you can see it is alphabetical  - it looks rather
as though someone has just snowpaked it out, or that it has just gone, has
it not?' snapped the judge. Mr Vereker, answered: 'That is a gap.'
The encounter is typical of the sharp questioning by Lord Justice Scott,
alongside judge's counsel Ms Presiley Baxendale QC, over the past three
months of hearings.
Lord Justice Scott's timely interventions have cut through virtually
impenetrable Whitehall jargon. He has also read thousands of government
documents made available to him on the instructions of the prime minister.
The volume of material and complexity of the inner workings of the Civil
Service might have worn down a less sturdy character.
'The judge is absolutely determined to get to the heart of what has happened
and he will follow it through in a very determined way,' says Christopher
Muttukumaru, an assistant Treasury solicitor and secretary to the inquiry.
'He is enjoying this immensely and finding it enormously challenging.'
But Lord Justice Scott's approach has apparently jangled nerves in
Whitehall. Though one Conservative MP close to the government claimed
yesterday he had heard 'neither a murmur nor a ripple' about the inquiry,
others in the Commons suggest the government is nervous.
Few who know Lord Justice Scott are surprised at the spectacle. 'He is
completely fearless, enormously intelligent and won't accept waffle,' says a
former colleague. 'He wants to get to the bottom of things and does.'
Lord Justice Scott was brought up in South Africa, but was born, of English
parents, in Dehra Dun, northern India, where his father served in the 2/9th
Gurkha Rifles. His early childhood was spent in Peshawar and it was not
until he was eight that the family moved to a 500-acre dairy farm on the
Mooi River in the Natal midlands.
He was educated at Michaelhouse, one of South Africa's elite private
schools, where he excelled both in the classroom and on the sportsfield. He
read law at Cape Town University before taking up a Commonwealth scholarship
to Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1955. He gained a first as well as a rugby
blue at wing forward.
Lord Justice Scott met his wife Rima Ripoll, the daughter of a Panamanian
dancer, during a year teaching in the US after which he returned to London
and joined the Chancery Bar. His rise to the top of the profession was
rapid.
He took silk in 1975 and in 1982 at just 48 was elected Bar chairman. The
following year he moved on to the High Court bench where he quickly found
himself in the limelight, trying the case brought by the government against
The Guardian newspaper for return of a confidential memo leaked by Sarah
Tisdall, the former Foreign Office clerk. He ordered the document's return
on the grounds that it was government property. Ms Tisdall was later
convicted under the Official Secrets Act and jailed for six months.
It was not until 1985 that his libertarian credentials became established
after he granted a group of South Wales miners an injunction preventing
officals of the National Union of Mineworkers organising mass-picketing.
But it was Lord Justice Scott's judgment in the 1987 Spycatcher case, where
he rejected ministers' attempts to place a permanent ban on press coverage
of former MI5 officer Peter Wright's book, which made him a media darling.
Later, his place as one of England's less conformist judges was assured,
when he warned of the dangers of government legislation on confidentiality,
saying judges should be left to develop the law and to reflect society's
needs.
Yet barristers say he is tough, can be brusque, and drives his court hard.
'He's been a great success on the bench,' says one QC, 'but he's not the
warmest of judges. You could say he's 'slightly Olympian'.'
The only apparent blot on an anti-establishment reputation is his love of
fox hunting. He regularly rides out with the Grafton Hunt in north
Oxfordshire and with a local draghunt  - the Farmers' Bloodhounds  - which
hunt a man leaving an animal-scented trail rather than a real fox.
This country activity fits his Action Man persona (he is a fit-looking
58-year-old) but sits oddly with the green image he creates by bicycling to
work each day, and his unstuffy social and parental manner. He enjoys his
social life with his high-spirited wife while having gracefully accepted the
conversion to Islam of a son and a daughter.
A close friend says of him: 'What underpins both his private and
professional life is a very firm belief that there should be personal
freedom of action so far as it does not impinge on the general good.'
But it is Scott's reputation as a judge capable of taking on the political
establishment that begs the question of why the government picked him to
lead the Iraq inquiry.
Those close to him insist that his appointment is as much a mystery to him
as to the bulk of the judiciary. Some close to the inquiry suggest the
appointment was made after unusually high level consultations, including
with the prime minister. Mr Major apparently wanted to be seen to be
committed to more open and fair government, which would be better served by
appointing a judge like Lord Justice Scott than one with a more compliant
reputation.
The next big test of Lord Justice Scott's style however, will come in the
autumn, when taking their turn before the judge will be the prime minister,
and his predecessor, Baroness Thatcher.

FT  10 JUL 93 / Not over until all the fat ladies sing: Why does the Uruguay
Round matter? Martin Wolf explains what the trade agreement in Tokyo might
mean
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN WOLFE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
By the way, Martin,' remarked the deputy editor, 'we want a feature for the
Saturday paper on what the Tokyo trade deal will mean. You know, who the
losers and who the gainers will be, that sort of thing.'
I blenched. 'In the first place,' I explained pedantically, 'we don't even
know what has been agreed. In the second place, they are still far from a
conclusion to the Uruguay Round. In the third place, nobody knows what such
a trade deal means quantitatively.'
'What about the British officials who say it could produce 400,000 jobs in
the UK over the next 13 years? Where did they get that figure from?'
'Heaven knows,' I replied. 'Increased trade generates additional economic
welfare. Its impact on employment depends on what you assume about real wage
flexibility, and so on.'
'What are you saying? That figures like that are simply made up?'
'Yes and no. They are made up, but pseudo-scientifically.'
'Well, what about Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative,' persisted the
deputy editor? 'He said it was the 'biggest tariff-cutting agreement in
history' and claimed a successful trade round would create an extra 1.4m
jobs in the US over 10 years and 2m over 13 years.'
'That's no proof, I'm afraid. For a person who prides himself on his
resistance to 'trade theology', Mr Kantor is getting mystical. Did you
notice that 600,000 of these extra jobs are supposed to come more than 10
years from now? Who knows what might happen by then?'
Irritation began to break through the deputy editor's calm demeanour.
'Anyway,' he insisted, 'we want a feature. Go and talk to the features
editor about it.' Thus admonished, I went.
'Yes,' that formidable personage remarked in her most head-mistressly
manner. 'You must tell readers what this deal might mean. But remember they
are bored silly by this Gatt business. So make it imaginative, even amusing.
And no ifs, buts or footnotes. You know what the editor thinks about
footnotes.
'What are you going to say,' she demanded?
'Well,' I replied, 'the first point is that it's not over until the fat
ladies sing in harmony. They have many difficult decisions to reach between
now and next December, when renewal of Mr Clinton's 'fast track' authority
runs out.'
'What's a fast-track authority? Come on, Martin, leave out the
technicalities, for once. Imagine you're trying to explain what you mean to
your elderly uncle.'
'A fast-track authority,' I explained patiently, 'means that Congress can
only vote for or against the agreement as a whole. It cannot destroy it by
amendments.'
'Well, what does still have to be done?'
'The first thing is to obtain concessions from the other participants in the
Uruguay Round to match those made by Canada, the European Community, Japan
and the US. Probably the most sensitive issue will be tariffs on textiles
and clothing. There will also have to be a multilateral steel agreement, to
reduce distorting subsidies. Japan and South Korea will have to accept
liberalisation of rice imports and France will have to agree to last year's
farm trade deal with the US or to be overruled on the issue.'
'Could the French veto the deal?'
'Strictly speaking, it has no veto. The question is whether other EC member
states will be prepared to outvote France. Much depends on Helmut Kohl.
'Then there is trade in services,' I continued. 'The Japanese and Koreans
have to liberalise financial services, like banking, while the US wants the
Europeans to liberalise audio-visual services.'
'There you go again. What does that mean?'
'It means Hollywood's right to flood the globe with pap,' I replied. 'For
once, the French have a point. Unfortunately, much more is left to be
decided in services than just these tricky issues.
I pressed on. 'Apart from services, there is also doubt about whether an
integrated disputes mechanism will be established within the proposed new
multilateral trade organisation (MTO). Given the hostility to that idea of
environmentalists and other pressure groups, particularly in the US, the MTO
may share the fate of the International Trade Organisation, which perished
on its way to the US Congress in the late-1940s.'
'Stop,' she shrieked. 'We already know the round may never be finished. Our
readers need to know what the round would mean if it were finished.'
'Well, among the winners would be exporters of farm produce, such as
Argentina, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Thailand and other members of the
'Cairns group'.' I noticed the features editor was ostentatiously filing her
nails, but ignored her. 'Anyway, one should not exaggerate the difference
this deal might make. Farm trade liberalisation would only begin with the
Uruguay Round. More important than the actual liberalisation might be the
ceiling it would put on any future increases in farm subsidies.
Exporters of clothing from developing countries would gain too, but not all.
Chinese exports would be the main beneficiary. Some developing countries are
protected by the bilateral quotas of the MFA and would lose if it were
liberalised. Efficient steel producers should benefit, wherever they are
located. This is not a north-south issue. Competitive steel producers are
found everywhere.
'Industrial country producers of pharmaceuticals, recorded music, videos,
computer software and books, all of whom should obtain more effective patent
and copyright protection, would also make substantial gains.
'US and British companies expect to do well in services, particularly
financial services, but France, too, wouyld be in a strong position.
Financial service providers like American Express have been among the most
influential US supporters of the Uruguay Round. If they do not get what they
hope for, there may not be enough support in Congress to pass the package.
'Another high potential export sector for some industrial countries is
telecommunications. The economic pressure for liberalisation is very strong,
which means the Uruguay round may not make much difference. But big US
suppliers, along with companies like BT, should gain. The traditional PTTs
are likely to come under huge pressure. New cross-border and cross-industry
alliances seem certain.
'Losers are simply the mirror-image of the gainers: highly protected
farmers, makers of labour-intensive manufactures in high wage countries and,
more generally, producers who need their protection to survive.'
'Isn't it possible to be more precise than that?
'Not really,' I replied. 'You have to remember that tariff reductions are to
be phased in over five years. after ratification. Liberalisation of the MFA
is due to take 10 years, with the bulk of that liberalisation towards the
end. Nobody can really tell what might happen to world trade in clothing by
2003.'
The features editor pulled a 'what wishy-washy features I have to put up
with' kind of a face. 'Can't you say something about employment,' she
pleaded?
'I am glad you asked that,' I replied. 'Fortunately, the first thing Peter
Sutherland, the Gatt's new director-general, asked from his staff was an
analysis of the link between trade and jobs. They made the important point
that 'the jobs and trade debate is not a debate about jobs, but about which
jobs'.
'Rich countries would exchange low paying jobs in import-competing industry
for higher paying jobs in export-related industry. Over the last few years,
the most dynamic markets for industrial country exporters have been China,
the Middle East and Latin America. In fact, between 1986 and 1990, virtually
all job growth in US manufacturing was in exports, while a recent study by
the US trade representative's office found that workers in export-related
jobs earn 17 per cent more than the average US worker. So trade
liberalisation is how rich countries will get more of the 'good jobs' that
president Clinton wants.
Meanwhile, poorer countries would obtain more jobs for each unit of
investment. So both sides would gain, which is what trade is all about.
'Is that all there is to say?'
'Not at all,' I replied, warming to the theme. 'If exports of manufactures
from developing countries continue to grow at their recent pace, the
ultimate effect might well be an increase in wage inequality in rich
countries, other things being equal, but less inequality in poor countries.
Industrial countries would have to find imaginative ways to deal with the
problem. It would be disgraceful to make the poverty of developing countries
an excuse for policies that keep them poor.
'But the most important effect of an agreement in the Uruguay Round would be
preservation of a multilateral trading system. That would confirm the wisdom
of the outward-looking, market-oriented policies adopted by so many
countries in recent years. These policies should, in turn, spread the
exceptionally rapid growth of east Asia during the past decade or two to
other parts of the world, including to the industrial countries who provide
nearly all the capital goods developing countries need.'
'Is that all there is to say?' asked the features editor, looking at her
watch.
'Not at all,' I replied. 'Even if successful, the Uruguay Round would be one
in a probably endless series. Something will have to be done to secure a
global competition policy, instead of controversial anti-dumping and
countervailing duty measures. The US will have to be weaned off its desire
to manage trade, particularly with Japan. I am not particularly concerned
about the supposed threat of regional trade blocs, since there is not going
to be one in east Asia. But an accommodation must be made with the
environmentalists, though not one that satisfies the urge of some of them to
push humanity back into the self-sufficient manorial economy of the Dark
Ages.
'So what does that mean? Yet another round?'
'Absolutely. The next one will have to start well before the results of the
Uruguay Round are harvested. I think it might be called the Beijing Round.'
The features editor smothered a yawn. It was obvious she was never going to
be persuaded that Saturday readers should be served this arid sort of stuff.
'All right,' she said. 'But make sure you get the copy in early. You know
how difficult Fridays always are.'

FT  10 JUL 93 / Leading Article: Summiteers vs speculators
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
JUST AT the point when economic summitry was assumed to have passed
irretrievably beyond its natural shelf life, events in Tokyo have conspired
to defer the post-mortem. True, the much-trumpeted tariff-cutting deal was
the work of ministers from the 'Quad' group of countries - the US, the EC,
Japan and Canada - rather than the seven summit countries. But the
endorsement of the Group of Seven will add to the pressure to complete the
stalled Uruguay trade round. Nor is the Dollars 3bn (Pounds 2bn) Russia fund
a negligible piece of economic diplomacy at a time when the G7 nations apart
from Japan are under tight fiscal constraints.
The ready promises of fiscal and monetary virtue in yesterday's communique
are another matter. But at least there was no row; and while the trade deal
on access for manufactured products is just one step on an arduous path that
has yet to address the thorny issue of farm trade, it runs pleasingly
counter to expectations in a world economy that is increasingly marred by
echoes of the economic frictions of the 1930s.
That, indeed, is just what high-level economic diplomacy is meant to be
about. The mere process of establishing a summit agenda puts pressure on
world leaders to address difficult issues in a forum that helps them rise
above bureaucratic and political constraints. In the mid-to-late 1970s
relatively informal gatherings actually achieved something by preventing a
more rapid slide towards protection after the first oil crisis. It was only
when summits became more formal and ambitious, with attempts at global
demand management and co-operative exchange rate agreements, that they
became nugatory.
Bitter memory
That is one reason to feel more cheerful about trade after the Tokyo
meetings than about the promises to bring down European interest rates and
to cut the US budget deficit. The Bundesbank was not represented at the
summit; and its officials retain a bitter collective memory of the
inflationary consequences of the 1978 summit, which required Germany to act
as a locomotive for the world economy. Nor is the US Congress a soft touch
on the budget. A better trade deal might have been done, notably over
textiles, were it not for President Clinton's worries about pushing through
his tax bill. As for the Japanese, if they deliver on their promise to
stimulate demand further, it will be because they perceive it to be in their
domestic interest to do so.
The other reason to be sceptical about the aspirations of the summiteers on
the monetary front is that they are a much less potent force in today's
world economy than the speculators. These appear to be offering an
alternative, quicker solution to the problem of deficient demand in
continental Europe by putting the French franc to the test. Yesterday the
franc moved perilously close to its floor within the ERM as money flooded
into the D-Mark, largely in response to a worsening official forecast of the
shrinkage in French GDP this year, together with a prediction that
unemployment would rise from 11.5 per cent to 12.5 per cent by December.
Politically untenable
Clearly the money men scent that the high level of French real interest
rates in a deepening recession is becoming politically as well as
economically untenable. French monetary policy is in the hands of the
Bundesbank, which still has to cope with inflation of more than 4 per cent,
money supply growing at above its target and worries about D-Mark weakness
against the dollar and the yen. Unless German interest rates come down
further and faster than the Bundesbank has so far allowed, the pressure on
the franc can only increase.
But unemployment, which was a more pressing concern for the summit
participants this week than inflation, is not solely attributable to
deficient demand. In Europe, whose five largest economies have an average
unemployment rate of more than 11 per cent, it has a disproportionately
large structural component. And here a report agreed by the G7 finance
ministers shifted from previous summits' emphasis on deregulation to active
public policies, including measures on education and training. This followed
President Clinton's call for a ministerial summit to consider the causes of
structural unemployment and potential remedies.
Whether a global meeting makes sense when the structural features of labour
markets in the US, Europe and Japan are so obviously different is a moot
point. The pressing problem is Europe, which suffers from real wage
rigidity, low mobility and high non-wage employment costs. These are already
the subject of an initiative by Mr Jacques Delors within the European
Community. And the OECD is conducting a wider review, which covers the G7
and most of the developed world.
At first sight, there may seem little harm in duplicating the effort in a
summit talk shop. But if the talk focuses on the export of jobs from the
developed world to Asia, the risk is that protection could come back on to
the agenda via the back door - an outcome that should be stoutly resisted.

FT  10 JUL 93 / Dilemma of sterling recovery: The resurgence of the pound
brings its own problems
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHAT A difference a year can make in the life of the pound sterling.
Nearly 12 months ago the government and the Bank of England were battling to
stop the pound falling below its floor against the D-Mark in the European
exchange rate mechanism.
Now the authorities face the opposite dilemma.
Sentiment towards sterling has improved sharply in recent weeks, amid signs
that the UK is one of the few countries in Europe to be enjoying economic
growth this year.
Earlier this week the pound hit a high for this year of DM2.57  - about 9
pfennigs above its level exactly a month ago and 11 per cent above its level
in February.
The currency lost some ground to a stronger D-Mark towards the end of the
week. But some economists still predict that the pound could reach DM2.60 or
DM2.65 in the short term, particularly if there is renewed turmoil in the
ERM this autumn.
That might cause problems for the government. There are signs that
sterling's rise may be hampering the UK's trading position by making exports
more expensive. Last week the Confederation of British Industry reported a
'slight setback' in exports to Europe in the first two weeks of June.
Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief currency strategist at Citibank, believes that the
UK authorities will become extremely concerned if the currency rises to
DM2.60 or DM2.65. In his view, that would roughly correspond with sterling's
purchasing-power parity level  - the level at which the exchange rate
matches the value of the goods that it trades  - and a move higher would
actively undermine the UK's export competitiveness.
'If the government allows the currency to move to those levels, then it will
be ensuring that this is the shortest economic recovery in history,' Mr
MacKinnon said.
But what action can the UK authorities take to cap the rise of the pound?
One thing must be almost certain  - there will be little appetite in
government for returning to the days of a sterling target, tacit or
otherwise. Mr Nigel Lawson, the former chancellor, ran into severe problems
trying to shadow the D-Mark in the late 1980s, and his successor, Mr Norman
Lamont, was unable to maintain sterling's ERM parity.
Cutting base rates would be more popular, especially with worried Tory
backbenchers. A lower short-term return for international investors would
cause some to sell sterling, and have the additional benefit of stimulating
consumer spending and the housing market.
But it could backfire and boost the pound further, because foreign exchange
dealers sometimes put a higher premium on economic growth than short-term
gain.
'If interest rates are cut in a country where growth already exists, the
tendency is for the currency to rise further,' said Mr Jeremy Hawkins,
economic adviser at Bank of America in London.
However, the government could decide to do nothing. Although sterling is
enjoying a rise at the moment, the size of the public sector borrowing
requirement, at Pounds 50bn this financial year, has raised serious concerns
about the state of the public finances, which could undermine investors'
sentiment towards the end of the year.
The government might even take some perverse pleasure from its political
difficulties, knowing that such troubles have regularly stopped the pound in
its tracks. One reason for sterling's small setback this week was that the
government set the date for the Christchurch by-election  - July 29  - and
it could face a humiliating defeat there.
However, recent official figures show that although the volume of UK exports
rose in the first quarter of this year, there was an even sharper rise in
the value of these exports, which suggests that Britain's business community
is more concerned with margins than with volumes.
Mr Ian Harnett, UK economist at Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull, said:
'Since the early 1980s sterling's value has halved from about DM5.00 to
around DM2.50. But we still have a huge trade and current account deficit.
'There is nothing to be gained by worrying about the exchange rate,' he
said. 'The only thing that has any impact on exports is the level of
domestic growth  - and that is the only issue that the government should
consider when setting base rates.'
The question that cannot be answered is whether Mr Kenneth Clarke, the
chancellor, agrees.
But a strong view in City dealing rooms is that Mr Clarke will cut interest
rates by the end of the year  - perhaps by 1 percentage point - because of
the likelihood that the domestic economic recovery will falter.
Then sterling could go where it may.

FT  10 JUL 93 / Receivers at Swans cut 286 more jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ANOTHER 286 jobs are to go at Swan Hunter, the Tyneside shipbuilder,
receivers Price Waterhouse said yesterday.
The latest cuts bring to more than 700 the total number of redundancies
since the company went into receivership two months ago after failing to win
a helicopter carrier order.
Mr Tommy Brennan, Tyne chairman of the Confederation of Shipbuilding and
Engineering Unions, said: 'It's quite obvious that Swan Hunter is bleeding
to death in the present circumstances.'
The company, he added, was 'haemorrhaging jobs' as delays in finding a buyer
and securing a prospective Pounds 40m Omani patrol boats order continued.
Swan's greatest asset, he said, was its workforce. 'Now we are seeing the
workforce decimated.'
The 286 redundancies, more than unions had expected, cover 143 hourly paid
employees, 78 managerial, technical and clerical staff and 65 short-term
contract workers.
Half will leave next Friday and the rest the following Friday, when the
company's two-week summer holiday begins. Employees will not learn until
next week which of them are to lose their jobs. The latest cuts will reduce
the payroll to 1,700, including 60 short-term contract workers.
Mr Ed James, one of the receivers, said the redundancies were inevitable in
view of the company's present workload. He said he was confident however
that key technical expertise had been retained while the search for a buyer
continued.
Price Waterhouse confirmed yesterday that no firm bids for the company had
been received. The receivers told the unions they were in contact with four
interested parties.
A week ago the Ministry of Defence agreed to allow the shipyard to finish
three Type-23 frigates, its main workload, giving it work until November
1994.
Mr Brennan urged the government to offer Swans a breathing space by giving
it some refit and repair work. He feared Swans was in a 'chicken-and-egg'
situation over the Omani order, with prospective buyers waiting to see if it
materialised.
Mr Steve Byers, Labour MP for Wallsend, said government delay in taking
positive measures to assist Swan Hunter had created a climate of
uncertainty, leading to job losses.
Talks on Thursday between Mr Tim Sainsbury, the industry minister, and Mr
Karel van Miert, European Community competition commissioner, on whether
Swans should become eligible for EC subsidies ended inconclusively.
Workers were disappointed yesterday but not surprised at the latest cuts. Mr
George Tweedy, an ancillary worker, said: 'We're just hoping it's the last.'

FT  10 JUL 93 / Patten sparks new tests dispute: Teaching unions angry at
government's national curriculum date announcement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By:BY JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN PATTEN, the education secretary, provoked another confrontation with
teachers' unions yesterday by setting a date for next year's national
curriculum tests for 14-year-olds in England and Wales.
The tests were widely boycotted by teachers this year, and are the subject
of a wide-ranging review by Sir Ron Dearing, chairman-designate of the
Schools Curriculum and Assessment Authority.
Earlier this week two unions announced that their boycott would continue
next year unless the Dearing review produced substantial changes to the
workload of the tests.
Mr Patten yesterday announced that next year's tests would take place in the
week starting May 9. The tests took place in June this year.
The change in date was first suggested by Mr Patten last month in a speech
to the conference of the National Association of Head Teachers. It was
greeted with jeers.
The Department for Education said that the change had been made following
direct requests from the unions. It will avoid timetable clashes with GCSE
exams.
Mr Eamonn O'Kane, deputy general secretary of the National Association of
Schoolmasters Union of Women Teachers, described the move as crass and
ham-fisted. 'Mr Patten's pre-empting the whole review,' he said. 'It seems
to me to undermine the position he's taken ever since the review was
announced.' He added that Sir Ron could still recommend the abandonment of
the tests.
The National Union of Teachers took a similar view. It said it would expect
the education secretary to wait for the interim report  - due in a couple of
weeks  - before making announcements about the date of the tests. Mr Patten
was guilty of 'political interference' and 'consistently undermining the
independence of the review'.
Writing in yesterday's Times Educational Supplement, Sir Ron said he had
found a consensus that the curriculum was over-prescribed, and would look
into the scope for greater use of external moderators of teachers' own
assessments.

FT  10 JUL 93 / Turbulent leasehold bill passes final hurdle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE controversial Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Bill
passed its final parliamentary hurdle this week. It awaits royal assent.
The turbulence of the bill's passage through parliament stems from the first
of its three main provisions  - the right it gives leaseholders to buy their
freeholds. The bill also gives local authority tenants the right to buy a
share in their homes, and it sets up an urban regeneration agency to tackle
dereliction.
Opposition came from Conservatives who consider that forcing landlords to
sell freeholds to leaseholders undermines property rights and the sanctity
of contracts. According to the Duke of Westminster, who resigned from the
Conservative party over the issue, the bill was 'an infringement of
long-standing democratic principles'.
The impact of the bill may be less than tenants hope and landlords fear,
however. According to its Labour critics the bill is 'a damp squib on a dull
day'. They believe that many of the 750,000 leaseholders who expect to
benefit from the legislation will be disappointed.
The House of Lords put forward nearly 300 amendments which went some way to
reducing the impact of the legislation.
Some amendments excluded particular groups from the legislation. People
living in cathedral closes are excluded, for example.
Other measures have a wider impact, such as the introduction of a residence
test designed to stop speculators benefitting from the new legislation. Half
the participating tenants have to be resident in a property to qualify, so
the building must have been the tenant's only or principal home for at least
a year, or for three out of the last 10 years.
Sir George Young, the housing minister, says the measure 'will exorcise the
spectre of control by an absent minority'. Critics argued that it would
substantially reduce the number of leaseholders who could benefit from the
legislation, particularly for flat owners in blocks where there was a highly
mobile population.
A far-reaching set of amendments in the Lords affects the 50,000 high-value
houses (with a rateable value of more than Pounds 1,500) that were excluded
from the leasehold enfranchisement measures of 1967.
These will add considerably to the cost of enfranchisement by including
several assumptions in the valuation of such freeholds:
Leaseholders should not be assumed to have security of tenure.
Landlords should receive at least half of any marriage value  - the extra
value from combining landlords' and tenants' interests.
Landlords should be compensated for 'injurious affection', meaning the loss
which enfranchisement might inflict on a landlord's other property.
The measures provoked dismay among leaseholders. Ms Joan South of the
Leasehold Enfranchisement Association, a lobby group, said: 'We are terribly
disappointed.'

FT  10 JUL 93 / Tories rethink sports shake-up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PLANS to restructure the Sports Council have been abandoned by the
government - to ensure that as much money as possible goes directly to sport
rather than to administration.
Mr Iain Sproat, national heritage minister, told the House of Commons
yesterday that proposals for an English Sports Council and an over-arching
Sports Commission for the whole of the UK had been dropped.
Mr Sproat said that 37 per cent of the Pounds 51m allocated to sport each
year was already taken up by running costs and he did not want to see the
creation of a 'vast bureaucracy' that would increase that percentage.
'I want to make sure that when we give money to encourage sport in this
country, it goes to sports people at the sharp end and not to bureaucrats,'
he added.
He said he would announce fresh proposals as soon as possible bearing in
mind 'the need for effective management of the new stream of income for
sport which will follow the introduction of a National Lottery'.
The changes - sparked by the Atkins Review of sport and active recreation,
published in December 1991 - were due to take place in October.
Labour attacked the government for instituting another review after two
years of continuing discussions on the best approach to sports funding. Mr
Tom Pendry, the party's sports spokesman, urged ministers to 'get talks on
the road again' without delay.
The Sports Council said it was 'disappointed but not surprised at the policy
change'. The latest review was the seventh in the past five years and none
of the conclusions of the previous six had been acted on by government. The
council, it added, would 'not be looking forward to another review with
unqualified rapture'.
Mr Pendry emphasised that each of the reviews had added substantially to the
council's administrative costs.

FT  10 JUL 93 / Nadir deceived PPI auditors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR ASIL NADIR, the fugitive businessman, illegally deceived the auditors to
Polly Peck International about his interest in a Turkish bank and failed to
disclose his holding in the 1989 PPI accounts.
The 1988 accounts of PPI show that Mr Nadir had an interest in both
Impexbank, based in Istanbul, and the Industrial Bank of Cyprus (IBK). The
1989 accounts refer only to IBK. Mr Nadir continued to hold Impexbank shares
 -allegedly bought with Polly Peck money - until he sold his interest in
1991.
He deceived the auditors, Stoy Hayward, by stating categorically that he did
not hold shares in Impexbank, in contravention of the 1985 Companies Act.
The act requires disclosure of any transactions related to directors of a
company and makes deceiving the auditors an offence.
Impexbank was used to channel at least Pounds 158m of the Pounds 371m Mr
Nadir allegedly removed from PPI between 1987 and 1990. The details are
contained in a letter from Mr Nadir to his auditors and believed to be in
the possession of the Serious Fraud Office.
In response to a specific request from a senior audit partner, Mr Nadir
signed a letter on PPI notepaper in April 1990 - six months before PPI went
into administration - stating that he had no beneficial interest in the
shares of Impexbank during 1989.
He also said he had no beneficial interest in the shares of AN Graphics, the
Turkish printing and publishing company that has stakes in many of the PPI
Turkish businesses. Mr Nadir attempted to gain control of AN Graphics shares
just four days before PPI went into administration.
Last week PPI administrators won a ruling in the Manx courts that the
transfer of shares from Voyager, a PPI subsidiary, to Mr Nadir was illegal.
The shares were apparently transferred in exchange Pounds 8m from Mr Nadir,
which the administrators say was never received by PPI.

FT  10 JUL 93 / Group of Welsh Labour MPs call for Jones resignation
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A GROUP of Welsh Labour MPs yesterday called for the resignation of Mr Gwyn
Jones, the former chairman of the Welsh Development Agency, as BBC governor
for Wales.
In an early day motion the MPs, including Mr Rhodri Morgan (Cardiff West),
and Mr Win Griffiths (Bridgend), condemned 'the disastrous catalogue of
mismanagement and worse' which was revealed in the report by the Commons
public accounts committee on the agency.
Their motion notes that Mr Jones is chairman of the board of BBC Wales, as
well as being a governor representing Wales.
The motion says: 'The evidence of his defective stewardship of the affairs
of the Welsh Development Agency from 1988 to 1993 renders him an unfit
person to hold the same responsibility for the BBC in Wales.'
The motion, in the names of nine MPs, calls on prime minister Mr John Major
to demand Mr Jones' resignation from the post.
Mr Jones made it clear yesterday he had no intention of resigning from his
BBC post. Friends said that Mr Jones planned to make a full statement soon
on all the criticisms made about the agency during his stewardship.
It is understood that Mr Jones will be interviewed for BBC Wales and a
number of newspapers.

FT  10 JUL 93 / Tory footsoldiers out of step with party: John Major faces
growing pressure over his leadership ahead of the crucial Christchurch
by-election at the end of this month. Pit closures, VAT on fuel and fears
over law and order have all added to his problems. Rachel Johnson visits two
very different constituencies to gauge Tory grassroot support
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
'IT'S a bloody mess,' said Rob. 'Hopeless,' agreed Harold. 'They should have
left Mrs T where she was,' said Bill, moodily staring into his empty pint
glass.
Predictable sentiments, perhaps, if from disgruntled Conservative voters.
But these were the voices of three Tory stalwarts in the blue-wallpapered
Llandridnod Wells Conservative Club.
Tory activists are getting restive. They see no reason why they should not
air their complaints to anyone who will listen. For one of their biggest
grouses is that the government does not.
The same message was brought home after three days spent in two very
contrasting Tory constituencies.
In remote, hilly Brecon and Radnor, the large agricultural Welsh seat, Mr
Jonathan Evans nosed ahead of the Liberal Democrats by 130 votes after two
recounts at the general election. In Chertsey and Walton, in plushest
suburban Surrey, Mr Geoffrey Pattie holds a majority of more than 22,000  -
making it one of the safest seats in the country.
The Conservative Association of Brecon and Radnor is losing supporters - 20,
including one branch chairman and two treasurers in the past eight weeks.
Chertsey Conservative Association has seen attendance falling at the cream
teas and barbecues so crucial for fundraising. And activists in both
associations are showing signs of losing heart.
Mr Michael Jefferies, a former policeman who is the agent for Mr Evans,
said: 'The troops are pissed off. It all started with David Mellor and look
at what's happened since. The presentation is appalling. They perceive John
Major as weak. The miners' issue was a killer.'
You will not, however, in either place hear a disloyal word spoken against
their MP.
Loyalty is particularly strong in Brecon and Radnor, a constituency famed
for nail-biting three-way fights in elections.
Mr Robin Gibson-Watt, the six-foot eight-inch Old Etonian gentleman farmer
who is chairman of the local Conservative Association said: 'I'd die for
Jonathan if he asked me to.'
Such loyalty, however, does not extend to the prime minister.
Mr Harold Nicholson, a local landlord who described himself as a 'Tory
footsoldier', said: 'He's weak, very weak. As bad as Ted Heath, one of the
worst.'
Europe was still one of the big issues and his gripe was Maastricht and the
drive to a federal Europe. 'They're closing creameries down here and Italy
hasn't even got milk quotas,' he said.
His neighbour, Mr Bill Griffiths, a beef wholesaler, is in despair because
his local abattoir has failed to open for the second year running. And the
European Community has just ruled that the waters of the spa town of
Llandridnod Wells are unsafe and cannot be served, even though they are
free, in the town's Pump Room.
VAT on fuel was another blow for a poor, sheep-farming community with a
large proportion of retired people.
Mr Jefferies said: 'We could have ridden out the uncertainty and inactivity
if we hadn't been walloped by these other things,'
Mr Bob Shearn, a former chairman of the Conservative Association, said:
'It's the worst time I can remember in 50 years. They (Central Office) just
don't listen to people.'
In Weybridge, in the heart of the Chertsey and Walton constituency, one does
not hear quite such mutinous plain speaking. But the fact that one hears it
at all in such a stronghold is just as telling.
Surrey is a rich commuter county  - 25 minutes from London, Heathrow and
Gatwick, bisected by the M25  - with emerald lawns, wide pavements and
business parks. But it contains its share of shuttered fronts and for-sale
signs.
In its way, Chertsey has had a worse recession than Brecon  - where
lamb-exporting farmers were delighted by the pound's exit from the European
exchange rate mechanism in what they call Golden Wednesday.
Mr Geoffrey King, president of the Chertsey constituency, picked his words
with care: 'The feelgood factor is very lacking. There is a fair spread of
grouse at the moment, which I think comes back to presentation.'
As in Brecon, there is perceived to be a John Major problem.
Mrs Rosemary Dane, Conservative councillor for Elmbridge said: 'The
government is indecisive. We used to know where we were. We need good strong
leadership.'
Many people pointed out that old-time Conservatives were suffering. Mrs
Audrey Kimmins, of the Conservative Political Centre, said: 'The ones who
have saved and given us their support are now just keeping their heads above
water. Then they look down the road and see someone who's got all he can
from the council and never done anything.'
The newest bugbear is, as in Brecon, VAT on fuel. Mrs Dane said: 'There are
little old ladies sitting on their own absolutely panic stricken.'
Low interest rates have also had an impact as the return on savings has
shrunk to almost nothing.
The Chertsey Tories are prepared to complain about policies and
presentation. But they still say it is Mr Major who will turn the party's
fortunes round. Mr Martin Brady, treasurer of the Conservative Association,
said: 'We must be firm. We are running the country, and an awful lot is
coming right. And Major's the best man for the job.'
In Chertsey there is a sense that, bar a defeat in Christchurch, the worst
may be over. The economy is on the turn and Mr Major will settle into the
job to 'plough his own furrow'. People vote for the party that makes them
feel wealthiest, and they see little danger of supporters deserting for
good. In the Llandridnod Conservative Club not even the fiercest Major
critic pointed to a preferred successor. They regard the prime minister as
the best of a bad bunch.
Mr Major may be the most unpopular prime minister on record, but his
footsoldiers still seem convinced that there is no alternative.

FT  10 JUL 93 / Export rules need reform, judge says
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LORD JUSTICE SCOTT has written to business leaders, trade unions, government
departments and members of the opposition seeking proposals for a reform of
Britain's exports and licensing procedures.
The judge makes clear that he is considering making recommendations on such
a reform as part of the report arising from his arms-to-Iraq inquiry.
Lord Justice Scott is understood to consider that present procedures are
unsatisfactory, both in terms of government efficiency and democratic
accountability.
He is questioning whether it is right that the government's control over the
removal of goods from the UK still should be set out in the Import, Export
and Customs Powers (Defence) Act 1939. The Act was brought in during a time
of war, but the Import and Export Control Act 1990 made it permanent.
The judge argues that although the act has 'the merit of simplicity', it 'is
not associated with any prescribed procedure for parliamentary scrutiny or
control'.
He says: 'It is understandable that in the terrible emergency of the
outbreak of war, powers of this breadth which are not subject to any
parliamentary scrutiny, let alone debate, should have been conferred on
government.'
He adds: 'It is less understandable that, in peacetime, such powers should
be maintained . . . . It appears to me, however, that the powers now
permanent . . . are totalitarian in concept and in effect.'
Although the full report is not expected to be completed until early next
year, responses to the judge's consultation paper are already being prepared
for submission at the end of July.
The Confederation of British Industry said yesterday that the paper was
being 'taken seriously' and had been discussed by an ad hoc committee on
export last month, although a formal reply had not yet been formulated.
The Department of Trade and Industry said last night that it was still
studying the judge's consultation document.
Ms Elizabeth Symons, the general secretary of the Association of First
Division Civil Servants, the trade union representing middle and
high-ranking civil servants, welcomed the judge's initiative.

FT  10 JUL 93 / Increase recorded in house prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOUSE PRICES rose in the second quarter of the year in all regions,
according to Halifax, the biggest building society, Scheherazade Daneshkhu
writes.
The largest gain was in East Anglia, which showed a 5.1 per cent increase
over the first quarter. The west Midlands recorded the lowest increase of 1
per cent.
However, prices are lower than for the same period last year in all regions
with the exception of Northern Ireland and Scotland. Greater London, with a
5.1 per cent drop, saw the largest fall in the second quarter compared with
the same quarter last year. Prices for the whole country dropped by 3.4 per
cent.
The news comes after Halifax's monthly figures this week showed average
house prices fell for the second month. Unlike the monthly data, quarterly
figures are not seasonally adjusted and reflect the stronger-than-expected
rise in prices in April and the sharp fall in January.
Halifax said the underlying regional picture of house-price inflation was
'perhaps not quite as buoyant as the figures would suggest' and any recovery
in the market would remain fragile. It predicted prices would rise more
steadily for the rest of the year.

FT  10 JUL 93 / Plans for Scottish water attacked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Ian Lang, the Scottish secretary, was accused yesterday of 'going halfway
down the road to water privatisation' with his plans for restructuring the
Scottish water industry.
In Thurday's white paper on reorganising local government in Scotland, Mr
Lang said that water and sewerage services would remain under public
ownership and operation. They would, however, be transferred from the 12
regional and island authorities which own them to three new water
authorities.
The white paper says the private sector will have a major role in providing
and financing 'much of the essential and large capital investment programme
over the next decade' under the Treasury's new policy on private finance for
public investments.
Mr Charles Gray, convener of the Labour-controlled Convention of Scottish
Local Authorities, said yesterday that the government was taking the same
path as that followed in the approach to the privatisation of the water
industry in England and Wales.
But Mr Lang said: 'There is absolutely no need to move any further on water
than we are going at the moment.'
He gave few details on how the private sector would be involved with the
Scottish water industry, which needs Pounds 5bn of upgrading over the next
15 years.
But he hinted that water treatment plants could be developed through schemes
under which private-sector companies would build, operate and own the
plants, transferring the treated water to the water authori-ties.
Water industry analysts believe there will be a lot of interest among
English and Welsh water companies in co-operating with the new Scottish
water authorities.
Provided the investment in new plant was recouped through charges to the
customer, it would be outside the public sector borrowing requirement,
analysts believe.
Mr Lang said the Scottish Office's plans were 'still at an embryonic stage'
and there would be further consultation.

SENIOR Conservatives believe Northern Ireland's unionist MPs will help the
government avoid an embarrassing upset when the Commons votes on
Maastricht's social chapter later this month.
Party strategists are increasingly confident that Mr John Major's recent
remark that he was 'four-square' behind Ulster's union with the UK, and this
week's row between British and Irish ministers over the province's future,
have improved relations between the Tories and Unionist MPs.
Although Conservative Maastricht rebels have yet to decide tactics, the
votes of the nine Ulster Unionist MPs could be critical.
The Maastricht bill returns to the House of Lords next week when Baroness
(formerly Mrs Margaret) Thatcher is expected to launch another attack on the
policies of her successor as prime minister.
There is anxiety about the debates on the social chapter which have to be
held by in the Lords and Commons before ratification, following a concession
by the government earlier this year.
In theory, the government could ratify the Maastricht treaty without the
social chapter even if it lost the vote. But some Tory Euro-sceptics may
still decide to vote for the social chapter in the hope of embarrasing the
government and improving the chances of a legal challenge to ratification.
Labour has drawn up an amendment for debate in the Commons deliberately
designed to force Mr Major to choose between accepting the social chapter or
not signing the Maastricht treaty.
Unionist MPs have helped the government avert Commons defeats before,
including on plans for pit closures.

FT  10 JUL 93 / Call for review of new trunk roads
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FRIENDS of the Earth, the environmental pressure group, has called on the
government to review its plans for trunk roads in order to save wildlife
sites.
The group claims that the decision this week not to go ahead with building a
road through 8,000-year-old Oxleas Wood in south-east London should have
wider implications.
When he announced the decision to look for a new route for the east London
river crossing, Mr John McGregor, transport secretary, said the scheme
failed to meet 'the high environmental standards we now apply to new road
schemes'.

FT  10 JUL 93 / Bernard Matthews poultry workers win RSI case
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIX POULTRY workers yesterday won claims for repetitive strain injury (RSI)
against Bernard Matthews, the poultry processor, in Norwich County Court.
Solicitors for the TGWU general workers union, which backed the workers,
said the case was the first to focus on training, job rotation and systems
of work in relation to RSI.
Previous cases had focused on whether employers had given adequate warnings
to workers about the risks associated with their jobs, the union's
solicitors said.
The term RSI is used to cover a range of conditions affecting the neck,
shoulders, arms and hands. In the past it was chiefly associated with manual
jobs, but is now affecting office workers who use keyboards.
The six awards - to three men and three women - ranged from nearly Pounds
6,000 to less than Pounds 650. The six worked on various tasks in the
manufacture of turkey products at two of Bernard Matthews' East Anglia
factories. A further three cases were rejected on medical grounds. The TGWU
said there were between 70 and 100 other RSI claims waiting in the company.
Mr David Joll, Bernard Matthews' managing director, said that Royal
Insurance, the company's insurers, had wanted to test the cases in court.
Representatives from several other insurance companies had attended the
hearings, he said.
The company, which employs 2,600 workers, said it had not yet had time to
consider the judgment in detail. It added that it had 'always placed the
well-being of its employees high on its list of business objectives'. It had
at no time underestimated the potential risk to its employees.

FT  10 JUL 93 / TV advertising deals probed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR GEORGE RUSSELL, chairman of the Independent Television Commission, is
looking into complaints about the way advertising time is sold around News
at Ten.
A number of advertisers are believed to have expressed concern about the
nature of the package deals being done.
One significant advertiser which is interested in reaching up-market AB men
and is particularly interested in the centre break during News at Ten, found
its advertisements also being run during children's programmes.
It is not clear whether this occurred because of anti-competitive pressures
or because of misjudgments by advertising agencies.
If advertisers were being required to buy slots around other programmes in
order to get their advertisements accepted for the News at Ten centre break
it would almost certainly be deemed anti-competitive, discriminatory
behaviour.
Sir George has been asking questions of the ITV companies to try to ensure
that nothing of the sort is happening.
The issue is sensitive because of the row over attempts to move News at Ten
to an earlier slot.
The fact that most television advertising is bought in packages rather than
individual slots makes it difficult to value a single advertising break or
get a clear view of the negotiating tactics of buyers and sellers.
Satellite dish ownership in Britain rose by 48,000 in the month to April 24,
according to the latest market research by GfK.
The market research group believes that by the later part of April 2.2m
homes had satellite dishes. GfK believes that there will be a slowing down
of satellite dish sales this autumn as a result of British Sky Broadcasting
 -a consortium in which Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, has a stake -
moving all its channels into a subscription package, with the possible
exception of Sky News.
GfK said: 'We would expect some slowing down in the net rate of sale.'
The company, whose research does not cover Northern Ireland, the Isle of Man
or the Channel Islands, is projecting a total of 2.5m dishes by the end of
the year.
Barb, the organisation which provides official television rating figures,
estimates that at the beginning of this month there were 2.48m
satellite-dish homes, compared with 2.44m a month earlier.

FT  10 JUL 93 / Row hampers talks on Ulster
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR PATRICK Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, is to try again to cajole
unionist and nationalist leaders back into 'round-table' talks - in spite of
a yawning gap that has emerged between the British and Irish governments.
The row over Northern Ireland's future that erupted on Thursday may signal
the end of a common approach between the two governments.
As if conceding that talks will not re-start in the autumn, as envisaged by
the UK, the Irish government is floating the possibility of the two
governments going over the heads of local politicians.
Mr Dick Spring, Irish foreign minister, has gone further. He has raised the
idea of 'joint sovereignty' in Ulster.
He was slapped down on Thursday by Sir Patrick. Mr Spring had broken the
'cardinal principle' that agreement must be reached by consent.
The squall reflects shifts in thinking both in London and Dublin. The
British government has become more overtly unionist. More importantly, the
prime minister departed from the usual script - that Northern Ireland should
remain part of the UK so long as a majority of its population wished to
remain - to say he was behind the union.
The shift may be partly because of the Conservatives' increased reliance on
the votes of Ulster Unionist MPs at Westminster. More probably, it is just
that the frustration of failing to re-start talks has provoked frank
opinions.
Irish officials believe unionists must not be allowed to make the running.
But Mr Spring is also keen to make a mark for his Irish Labour party, the
junior partner in the Irish government coalition. There is a desire to build
on the 1985 Anglo-Irish agreement which gave Dublin a token say in the
affairs of the north.
What will happen next? The most optimistic scenario is that unionists will
be so encouraged by the UK's apparently hardened line that they will
re-enter talks, dropping their insistance that the Irish government has
first to modify its constitutional claim on the north. Perversely, a row
between the British and Irish governments may soothe unionist fears about
their constitutional future.
More realistically, however, the Irish government's remarks will only
further delay the resumption of talks.
So Mr Spring's remarks could become self-fulfilling and the only way ahead
would be for the two governments to come together and map out a future for
Northern Ireland. The lesson he and Mr Reynolds have learned is that finding
agreement between the two governments is as hard as finding a deal between
the province's politicians.

FT  10 JUL 93 / Vote for Gonzalez as PM paves the way for coalition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR FELIPE GONZALEZ, whose Socialist Workers party (PSOE) was short of an
overall majority in general elections last month, was yesterday returned to
power for a fourth term thanks to the support in a congress investiture vote
of the Catalan and Basque nationalist parties.
The prime minister is expected to name a new government, which he said would
combine 'experience and new faces', early next week. The cabinet will
include a new economic team following the appointment of Mr Carlos Solchaga,
the economy ministerfor the past eight years, as the PSOE's parliamentary
leader.
The backing of the Basque PNV and Catalan CiU in the congress vote paves the
way for a coalition government, the first power-sharing experiment since
democracy was restored to Spain following General Franco's death in 1975.
The PNV's five representatives in congress and the CiU's 17 joined forces
with the 159 PSOE members to give Mr Gonzalez an absolute majority of 181
votes in yesterday's confidence motion.
The prime minister's nomination was opposed by 165 votes, which included the
141 members of the conservative Partido Popular and the 18 of the
communist-led Izquierda Unida coalition. Conservative leader Mr Jose Mara
Aznar nevertheless offered to support the government 'in any serious measure
to solve Spain's economic problems and create employment'.
Mr Gonzalez has now in theory a broad spectrum of support that should ensure
the stability of his government for the next four years.
'I hope to achieve a stable government, but we'll see, it won't be easy,' he
said after the vote.
Mr Solchaga is chairing separate joint commissions between the PSOE and the
two nationalist parties to establish common ground over key policy issues.
Mr Gonzalez outlined his most liberal programme to date, pledging to
decentralise power in favour of the regional autonomies  - a priority issue
for the nationalist parties  - and said he would contain public spending and
speed deregulation of the economy.
Mr Gonzalez could appoint a representative of the PNV to head the Industry
Ministry but the entry of Catalan nationalists, who are the more reluctant
coalition partners, to the cabinet is likely to take place only after an
autumn debate on next year's budget.
The CiU is seeking to negotiate a measure of fiscal co-responsibility
between Catalonia and the central administration, which would be reflected
in the 1994 budget, before committing itself to power sharing.
The reshuffled economic team is likely to headed by Mr Narcis Serra, the
deputy prime minister in the outgoing government.
Mr Serra  - an economist by training and a former mayor of Barcelona before
he joined the government, originally as defence minister  - has close
friendships with leading members of the CiU.
Mr Solchaga's former ministry, which combined both economy and finance, is
likely to split into two. Mr Gonzalez could switch agriculture minister Mr
Pedro Solbes, a technocrat who is not a member of the Socialist party, to
the economy portfolio and appoint Mr Oscar Fanjul, the re-spected chairman
of Repsol, the public energy group, finance minister.

FT  10 JUL 93 / Moscow claim to Crimean port angers Ukraine
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD and CHRYSTIA FREELAND

<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW, KIEV
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE RUSSIAN parliament yesterday claimed control of the naval port of
Sevastopol, the main base of the disputed Black Sea Fleet, opening the vexed
question of control of the Ukrainian region of Crimea.
Ukrainian officials in Kiev denounced the move as 'tantamount to a
declaration of war' and said the Russian claim would make the Ukrainian
parliament more likely to assert full control over the nuclear missiles
stationed on Ukrainian territory.
Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk dismissed the Moscow claim as illegal:
'This decision violates all international norms and has no legal force, in
accordance with the Helsinki and other accords.'
A resolution 'confirming the Russian federal status of Sevastopol' was
passed by 166 votes to 1. It also decreed that the government negotiate on
the use of Sevastopol as a base for a 'unified' Black Sea fleet.
This would be a direct contradiction of the agreement between the presidents
of Russia and Ukraine to divide the fleet 50-50, a move which has angered
many Russian officers and drawn protests even from General Pavel Grachev,
the defence minister.
A further clause was added before the vote which demanded that the Ukrainian
government, 'in order to avoid an increase in tension', withdraw its
'special units located in the area'  - that is, from its own territory.
The decree gave no details of how demands for Russian possession of
Sevastopol were to be carried through  - and the Russian government, as well
as President Boris Yeltsin, is likely to ignore the decision.
Mr Dmytro Pavlychko, chairman of the parliamentary commission on foreign
affairs, warned that the stand-off could easily escalate into 'a situation
like that in Abkhazia or the former Yugoslavia'.
He said the Ukrainian parliament could react to the Russian move by
asserting operational control over the nuclear weapons. Last week,
parliament claimed ownership of the weapons, but Ukrainian leaders insisted
they had no plans to develop positive control over the weapons on their
territory.
'The nuclear problem cannot be resolved now,' said Mr Pavlychko, one of the
main policy makers on nuclear issues. 'How can we give up our weapons to a
neighbour which is making territorial claims on us? Maybe now we must say we
will seek operational control over the missiles on our territory.'
Mr Pavlychko said that the situation could still be defused if Mr Yeltsin
distanced himself from parliament's declaration.

FT  10 JUL 93 / Ireland drops veto on EC aid plan: Dublin may still reject
share-out of funds if not satisfied
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE IRISH government yesterday lifted its veto on the EC's 1994-99 regional
development and structural aid programme, following conversations between
European Commission president Jacques Delors and Irish premier Albert
Reynolds.
This means that the six sets of rules for the Structural Funds  - Ecu141.5bn
(Pounds 109.4bn) of the Ecu157bn aid package  - are likely to go through the
European Parliament next Wednesday.
If this deadline had been missed, disbursement of the funds from this, the
biggest ever EC development aid programme, would almost certainly have been
delayed well beyond the beginning of next year.
However, in a statement that the Irish ambassador to the EC was due to give
Ireland's partners yesterday, Dublin makes clear that it will reject the
share-out of the funds if it is not satisfied it has secured 'an equitable
outcome', when EC foreign ministers meet in Brussels on July 19.
'We don't want to be accused of holding up the timetable,' an Irish official
in Brussels said, 'and there are sufficient signs of progress to lift the
reserve.'
But the official added that 'if we're not satisfied, we're saying that on
the 19th we're prepared to vote against the allocations then.'
Mr Reynolds is holding out for the IPounds 8bn (Pounds 7.6bn) he says
Commission officials guaranteed him at the Edinburgh summit, where the size
of the overall package was fixed. But senior Commission officials say it is
hard to justify any figure for Ireland above IPounds 7.5bn.
Nonetheless, in Dublin yesterday, government officials were hinting that the
IPounds 8bn figure was now in sight.
The IPounds 7.5bn figure the Commission was sticking to would be over the
seven years 1993-99, thereby adding in the allocation Ireland is already
receiving for this year under the last aid package.
But officials closely involved on both sides said yesterday that
improvements at the margin were being sought to bump up the Irish figure
without having to subtract funds from other Community member states.
One cosmetic possibility mentioned was to transfer the figures from the 1992
Ecus in which they were originally calculated to 1993 prices  - thereby
adding a nominal 4 per cent or so for inflation. In terms of real money, the
Commission got about Ecu1.4bn more than expected from the package, for
EC-wide regional aid programmes which Brussels runs, rather than allocating
to member state programmes.
Officials were understood to be exploring whether part of this could be
channelled towards Ireland.

FT  10 JUL 93 / Warning on cost of environmental clean-ups in US
</HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CONGRESSIONAL investigators have warned that the US government could end up
paying more to clean up unexploded bombs, abandoned mines and toxic wastes
on public lands than it spent on the savings and loan clean-up.
A report from the House of Representatives natural resources committee
identifies billions of dollars of potential government liabilities for
problems such as hazardous chemical dumps and contaminated drainage at old
mines in national parks and forests, as well as on lands run by the Bureau
of Land Management.
The National Park Service alone has identified 2,400 hazardous mine sites
and estimates the cost of cleaning them up at around Dollars 200m (Pounds
133m). The Forest Service has an estimated 25,000 mine sites, and the BLM,
which has not carried out an estimate, could have hundreds of thousands of
sites, the committee reports.
The report warns, however, that unexploded shells and bombs on former
military firing ranges could end up costing the government even more than
the abandoned mines, although the liability has drawn less attention.
Military base closures mean responsibility for more ranges will pass from
the Pentagon to the BLM.
At least 15 wildlife refuges are among the sites with unexploded shells.
The report also warns of nuclear contamination in Alaska from experiments
related to Project Chariot, a 1950s plan that was in the end not executed to
create a harbour in northwest Alaska by exploding nuclear bombs.
'The problem has been caused in large measure by government policies that
subsidised the exploitation of our natural resources at a time when we
lacked the knowledge that we have today about the negative impact of those
subsidies. What is truly frightening is that despite our knowledge we
continue to subsidise activities without regard to their devastating
environmental  - and economic  - impacts,' said Mr George Miller, the
committee's chairman.

FT  10 JUL 93 / Russia bank chief gloomy on economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE CHAIRMAN of the Russian Central Bank yesterday delivered a gloomy report
on the Russian economy to parliament  - undercutting the upbeat impression
of an economy picking itself off the floor which Russian officials have been
seeking to present at the Group of Seven summit in Tokyo.
Mr Victor Gerashchenko, reporting on the bank's accounts for last year, drew
a picture of an economy in which the flight of capital was out of control
and the government foreign exchange reserves were almost exhausted. He said
that, on January 1 this year, the Central Bank had reserves worth only
Rbs605.2bn  - about Dollars 600m (Pounds 400m)  - with gold reserves worth
Rbs137bn, or about Dollars 130m.
The country's GDP had declined by 18.5 per cent in 1992 from 1991, he said,
and inflation averaged 31.3 per cent each month in the past year, more than
expected. Mr Gerashchenko said the consumer price index had risen 26-fold in
the past year.
Though the bank chairman acknowledged that an agreement with the government
had drawn Russia back from the brink of a monetary crisis, he insisted that
the government had a duty to bail out heavily indebted state companies.
Mr Gerashchenko said Russia would receive no significant foreign investment
until the debt owed by the country to governments and to companies with
which it used to trade had been paid off.
Russian exports for 1992, he said, totalled only Dollars 38.1bn, a decline
of 26 per cent from 1991, half of which was accounted for by fuel and other
energy. Exports of machinery, once a large part of Russian exports,
represented only 9 per cent of the total in 1992, he said.
Noting that 'capital flight has grown enormously in the past year', Mr
Gerashchenko urged the government to adopt stricter rules in an effort to
stop the illegal export of hard currency.
The parliament 'took into account' a report on the Central Bank by the
auditing company Coopers and Lybrand, and demanded that the bank produce
figures within a week explaining the gaps in the accounts for last year
which had been noted in the report.

The International Monetary Fund is poised to grant Hungary a Dollars 700m
credit facility after the successful conclusion yesterday of the latest
round of talks in Budapest, Nicholas Denton reports from Budapest.
The IMF and the Hungarian authorities said they saw 'no obstacles which
would obstruct the conclusion of an agreement within a short space of time'.
The proposed 18-month credit accord has been contingent on the Hungarian
government acting to hold down a surging budget deficit. The authorities
have increased value added tax with the measure passing parliament this week
by a margin of 13 votes.

PARAGUAY'S new government plans a rapid resumption of its privatisation
programme, officials said in Washington yesterday.
Mr Enzo Debernardi, accompanying president-elect Juan Carlos Wasmosy for
talks in Washington with the International Monetary Fund, the Inter-American
Development Bank and the World Bank, said the new government aimed to sell
Paraguay's state-owned airline, railways, merchant river fleet, rum
distillery, cement factories and steel mill. It may also privatise the
telephone company.
Mr Debernardi, former finance minister and now Mr Wasmosy's principal
counsellor, said Paraguay had no immediate need for an IMF loan, but aimed
to establish a 'ghost programme' under which the IMF would monitor the
country's economic policies.
'We don't need immediate assistance, but we would like a programme with the
IMF,' Mr Debernardi said.
Mr Wasmosy will take office next month as Paraguay's first civilian
president for 40 years.

<TEXT>
Canadian banks will lower their prime lending rate on Monday from 6 per cent
to 5.75 per cent, the lowest level in 26 years, Bernard Simon reports from
Toronto.
This will be the first time in almost a decade that a key Canadian interest
rate has fallen below the US, where the prime is 6 per cent.
The prime rate in Canada reached a peak of 14.75 per cent in mid-1990. Its
slide since then is largely due to the Bank of Canada's success in bringing
down inflation to an annual rate of 1.8 per cent, a percentage point below
that of the US.
Despite the cut in interest rates, the Canadian dollar remained steady
yesterday at just above 78 US cents.

FT  10 JUL 93 / Warning on environment clean-up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CONGRESSIONAL investigators have warned that the US government could end up
paying more to clean up unexploded bombs, abandoned mines and toxic wastes
on public lands than it spent on the savings and loan clean-up.
A report from the House of Representatives natural resources committee
identifies billions of dollars of potential government liabilities for
problems such as hazardous chemical dumps and contaminated drainage at old
mines in national parks and forests, as well as on lands run by the Bureau
of Land Management.
The National Park Service alone has identified 2,400 hazardous mine sites
and estimates the cost of cleaning them up at around Dollars 200m (Pounds
133m). The Forest Service has an estimated 25,000 mine sites, and the BLM,
which has not carried out an estimate, could have hundreds of thousands of
sites, the committee reports.
Serious mine problems include the Clark Fork sites near Butte, Montana,
where the BLM could be liable for Dollars 100m-Dollars 300m of an estimated
Dollars 1bn clean-up cost.
The report warns, however, that unexploded shells and bombs on former
military firing ranges could end up costing the government even more than
the abandoned mines, although the liability has drawn less attention.
Military base closures mean that responsibility for more ranges will pass
from the Pentagon to the BLM.
One firing range singled out by the House committee report is the Aberdeen
proving ground, where the problems of unexploded shells are exacerbated by
an estimated 82,000kg of depleted uranium rounds.
At least 15 wildlife refuges are among the sites with unexploded shells.
The report also warns of nuclear contamination in Alaska from experiments
related to Project Chariot, a 1950s plan that was in the end not executed to
create a harbour in northwest Alaska by exploding nuclear bombs.
'The problem has been caused in large measure by government policies that
subsidised the exploitation of our natural resources at a time when we
lacked the knowledge that we have today about the negative impact of those
subsidies. What is truly frightening is that despite our knowledge we
continue to subsidise activities without regard to their devastating
environmental - and economic - impacts,' said Mr George Miller, the
committee's chairman.
While the committee staff presents no overall estimate, it suggests the
total clean-up cost, including sites run by the departments of defence and
energy and not covered by the report, could rival the bill for reimbursing
depositors in the tide of savings and loans institutions which went bankrupt
in the 1980s.
'These costs currently do not appear on any government ledger, yet they are
genuine liabilities that the taxpayer will one day incur,' Mr Miller said.
The Resolution Trust Corporation, set up by the federal government to handle
the S&amp;L bailout, has already closed 654 institutions at a cost of Dollars
190.8bn, and has recouped Dollars 88bn of that from asset sales.

FT  10 JUL 93 / Piech asserts his authority at VW
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Ferdinand Piech, Volkswagen chairman, yesterday publicly warned his
former vice-chairman not to speak out of turn and reasserted his authority
over his turbulent production director, Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua.
He also warned Mr Louis Hughes, chairman of General Motors Europe, that he
was doomed to lose his legal campaign against the German vehicle maker.
Last week's abrupt resignation of his deputy, Mr Daniel Goeudevert, was
mutually agreed, he said in an interview with Die Welt newspaper. Cuts at
the top level, part of a DM8bn (Pounds 3.1bn) economy drive, would reduce
management board costs by 30 per cent.
An arrangement under which Mr Goeudevert, formerly in charge of the VW
marque, was staying on as an 'adviser' was not an attempt to muzzle him, Mr
Piech insisted. 'But should Mr Goeudevert speak publicly about internal
matters, that would naturally have an inevitable influence on our further
co-operation,' he said.
Mr Piech quashed speculation - fuelled by Mr Lopez - that VW would shortly
start production in a new super-lean plant in the Basque country. It was
'out of the question at this time. . . I have told Mr Lopez this,' he said.
Addressing the legal investigations initiated by GM, Mr Lopez's former
employer, into suspicions of industrial espionage, Mr Piech said it was
'exclusively a personal campaign' by the Zuricher. (Mr Hughes, former head
of Adam Opel, GM's German subsidiary, is now based in Zurich.)
Mr Hughes had applied for the top job at VW, he claimed. He was not
'wounded' when he did not get it, but the legal attacks came when he lost Mr
Lopez to VW. 'General Motors is the last company where we could find
anything of use to us,' he commented.
Repeating that VW would break even this year after losses in the first
quarter, Mr Piech said 90 per cent of planned restructuring had already been
instituted.

FT  10 JUL 93 / Talks over Cyprus thrown into doubt: The surprise departure
of the Turkish Cypriot leader
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TALKS to settle the Cyprus problem have been thrown into doubt after Turkish
Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash said he would no longer negotiate on behalf of
his community.
Mr Denktash's surprise announcement this week follows a formal rebuke from
the United Nations secretary general's office about the breakdown of the
latest round of UN-sponsored talks at the end of May.
Mr Denktash, who for 30 years has headed the Turkish Cypriot community, says
his position has become untenable following repeated challenges at home from
his prime minister Mr Dervis Eroglu. Mr Denktash says Mr Eroglu has blocked
territorial concessions and opposes UN plans for a federal solution to end
the island's 19-year-old division.
But western diplomats in Ankara suspect Mr Denktash has deeper misgivings
about the progress of the New York negotiations and is using his dispute
with Mr Eroglu to stonewall the talks.
The man who once campaigned under the slogan 'partition or death' remains,
in the eyes of the UK and other permanent members of the UN Security
Council, the main obstacle to a settlement.
Since Turkey's occupation of the northern third of the island in 1974, the
UN and the international community have continued to see the Greek south as
the legitimate government of the island - the Turkish Cypriot republic is
recognised only by Turkey.
In Ankara, the Turkish generals continue to support Mr Denktash's cause. For
two decades now, the Turkish Cypriot leader has favoured serving and retired
officers with some of the island's best villas, many of them originally
Greek properties. Turkish Cypriot businessmen have also exploited the
island's anomalous legal status of favourable local tax and auditing
conditions, and are equally unenthusiastic about a solution which would
withdraw these privileges.
At the latest round of New York talks, the UN suggested the handover of the
Greek resort of Varosha, now deserted and under Turkish control, in exchange
for re-opening Nicosia's international airport.
Both steps would be taken under UN administration. Abandoned in 1974 when
Greeks fled the Turkish advance, Varosha, with its hotel blocks and deserted
beaches, remains a poignant symbol of the current stalemate and division.
Re-opening the international airport would be a further confidence-building
measure, and give a considerable boost to tourist arrivals in the north, all
of whom currently have to arrive via the Turkish mainland.
Leaving the talks in New York, Mr Denktash appeared to back the plan, so
much so that Turkey's President Suleyman Demirel, never one to force the
hand of the Turkish Cypriots, publicly endorsed the idea. However, the
maverick Mr Denktash - accompanied by Mr Eroglu - hen travelled to Ankara,
where he received a standing ovation from parliament, in rejecting the UN
plan.
Cyprus is still a national cause in Turkey but in Ankara impatience is
growing with the lack of progress. Even Turkey's instinctively nationalist
press is starting to question the open-ended commitment to Mr Denktash.
Cyprus has long been a big obstacle in Turkey's negotiations with the
European Community and Ankara expects increased US pressure for a
settlement.
Moreover, Turkey is overstretched in a range of foreign policy areas from
the Balkans, through the Caucasus to the unresolved situation in North Iraq.
For their part, the Greek Cypriots' fear is that the longer the issue
remains unresolved, the more likely one of the European countries will step
out of line and recognise the Turkish state.
If that happens, the Greeks fear this would encourage further intransigence
on the Turkish side.
In retrospect, the Turks may have missed a chance to push their case for
recognition in the wake of Turkey's robust support of the coalition against
Baghdad.
Much will depend on Mrs Tansu Ciller, the new Turkish prime minister. She
has still to indicate her choice as minister in charge of Cyprus, a key job
with a budget of Dollars 200m (Pounds 133m) to disburse, a considerable
lever of patronage.
Under the previous cabinet, the job was given to a former soldier more
familiar to the Greeks as one of the Turkish commanders of the 1974 invasion
force.

FT  10 JUL 93 / India orders closure of N-reactors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   NEW DELHI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INDIA'S Atomic Energy Regulatory Board has ordered the closure of eight
nuclear power stations for an inspection of turbines, generators and
associated components.
The decision to close the nuclear plants one by one follows the
recommendations of an expert committee set up to investigate the cause of a
fire at the Narora plant near Delhi in March.
The Madras nuclear power plant in operation for the past two years at
Kalpakkam, one of two in the southern state of Tamil Nadu, will be the first
to be shut down, by July 31.
Mr A Gopalakrishnan, chairman of the Atomic Energy Regulatory Board, said
there was 'no specific doubt about the operation of pressurised heavy water
reactor stations in the country', but the decision to shut down the stations
in sequence had been taken 'as a matter of abundant caution'.
The committee's report concluded that the Narora fire earlier this year, the
first accident at a nuclear power station in India, had resulted from a rare
combination of 'fatigue failure' of two steam turbine blades and
'deficiencies in the cabling system' leading to a loss of electric power
supply.
The total loss of power and an unprecedented 17-hour blackout of the station
could have been avoided if the board's earlier recommendations for
segregating cables and provision of fire barriers had been adequately
followed.
The plant's safety systems had worked well, according to the report, which
is why there was no leakage of radioactivity. 'We want to be totally
reassured that such a course of events do not reoccur in other power
stations equipped with similar turbo-generators,' said Mr Gopalakrishnan.
All nine Indian atomic power stations, which produce about 3 per cent of
India's power, are equipped with turbo-generators manufactured by the UK's
General Electric Company and the Indian government-owned Bharat Heavy
Electricals.
However, the Tarapur nuclear plant near Bombay is excluded from the shutdown
because it uses enriched uranium-light water technology, and the board
conducted a safety review at the station only recently.
Inspection and modifications, if required, would begin simultaneously at all
plants, and are expected to take two to three weeks to complete after each
plant is shut. Stations which are shut down for maintenance, like the second
Madras station, will be similarly tested before being allowed to resume
operations.
The government, which has denied charges by environmentalists that India's
nuclear power programme does not follow international safety standards,
plans to build as many as 15 more nuclear power reactors in the next 10
years, to ease the power crisis in the country.

</HEADLINE>

   SEOUL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ON THE eve of President Bill Clinton's visit to Seoul, a senior South Korean
official said yesterday his country should ultimately be responsible for
solving North Korea's nuclear problem rather than the US.
'The denuclearisation (of the Korean peninsula) has to be realised through
dialogue and consultations between South and North Korea,' said Mr Han
Wan-sang, the national unification minister, in apparent response to
domestic criticism that Seoul is relying too much on Washington in trying to
halt North Korea's nuclear weapons programme.
The issue is expected to head the list of topics to be discussed between Mr
Clinton and South Korean President Kim Young-sam at the weekend.
The present crisis has set back hopes in Seoul that the problems of
denuclearisation and eventual unification might be solved between the two
Koreas without involving other regional powers, including the US, China,
Japan and Russia.
That has been considered a desirable goal from Seoul's perspective because
it would symbolise South Korea's autonomy in deciding its own fate after a
century of being dominated by outside powers.
Besides relying on the US to intercede directly with Pyongyang, Seoul could
see the issue slip further from its control if the UN Security Council
becomes involved, which might include imposing economic sanctions on North
Korea if it does not accept full IAEA inspections.
The Clinton visit, however, could counter criticism that Seoul is playing a
secondary role, as the US president will be seen consulting the South Korean
government on the nuclear issue.
In a face-saving gesture, Seoul is also proposing again that North-South
talks should be held in parallel with the negotiations between Pyongyang and
Washington. A previous attempt to stage inter-Korean talks on the nuclear
problem collapsed over procedural issues.
Mr Han emphasised the importance of Seoul's position as an intermediary
between the US and North Korea. 'If North Korea gives up nuclear development
and guarantees nuclear transparency, South Korea will be able to help North
Korea actively to improve relations with the US and Japan,' he explained.

FT  10 JUL 93 / Pakistan to boost enrichment plant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HENDERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PAKISTAN is planning to expand its controversial uranium enrichment plant at
Kahuta near Islamabad in order to provide fuel for a nuclear power reactor
being bought from China, according to senior Pakistani officials.
An expansion, the costs of which are being assessed by the government, could
put an additional strain on Pakistan's relations with the US which cut off
Dollars 573m (Pounds 382m) of aid in 1990 because it thought the Kahuta
plant had made sufficient highly enriched uranium for several nuclear bombs.
If Kahuta were to supply all the fuel needed for the 300MW reactor being
built at Chashma on the river Indus, its output would have to expand
considerably.
Dr Abdul Qader Khan, founder and director of the research laboratories at
Kahuta, said in an interview in Rawalpindi: 'We believe that by the time we
have the Chinese reactor operational, we will have enough fuel to feed it.'
The reactor is expected to be commissioned in 1997.
He said the reactor would require low enriched uranium, containing about 5
per cent of the fissile isotope U-235, rather than the 90 per cent plus
needed in an atomic bomb. Natural uranium contains only 0.7 per cent of
U-235.
Dr Khan rejected the suggestion that Kahuta was being used for nuclear
weapons but acknowledged it could be.
'A knife can cut vegetables and a knife can kill human beings. So all
nuclear plants and all chemical plants all over the world can be used,
either for saving the human race or hurting them.'
He said Pakistan would open its facilities for inspection if India, which
exploded a nuclear device in 1974, did the same.
Dr Khan did show some conventional weapons that the laboratory makes
including a Pakistani version with improved electronics of a Chinese
shoulder-fired anti-aircraft missile, and an anti-tank missile also of
Chinese origin.
Pakistani officials said some work on the latter weapon is being done with
Chinese assistance at Golra, on the outskirts of Rawalpindi.
In 1988, Western officials said American satellite reconnaisance had
identified a suspected clandestine enrichment plant at Golra. Dr Khan
described this allegation as nonsense. The Golra site is the central
mechanical and transport stores of the Pakistan army.

<TEXT>
BRITAIN and China have resolved to make faster progress in their talks about
Hong Kong's political development, Mr Douglas Hurd, UK foreign secretary,
said yesterday after holding talks with Chinese leaders.
In Beijing he said his discussions with Mr Qian Qichen, China's foreign
minister, had been useful in clarifying how the two sides should proceed in
future rounds of talks about elections due in Hong Kong in 1994 and 1995. Mr
Hurd also met China's president, Mr Jiang Zemin.
'The tone and atmosphere of the meeting (with Mr Qian) seemed to me
positive, it was entirely forward-looking and from my point of view, and I
hope his, the meeting was well worthwhile,' Mr Hurd said.
The British foreign secretary gave no hint of a swift resolution to
negotiations, saying that there would be further rounds after the eighth
session which begins on July 20, and that he would meet Mr Qian in New York
in September to review progress.
However, he indicated there had been some progress in the last two rounds.
'There have been specific ideas, and that is important because the governor
(Mr Chris Patten) and we all have made it clear that we are ready to listen
carefully to Chinese ideas on this matter.'
It was understood that in the seventh round which finished this week China
presented a comprehensive proposal for the conduct of the 1994/95 elections.
British officials, while not necessarily agreeing with the shape of the
proposal, nevertheless hoped that the Chinese move would advance the
negotiations.
UK officials said the meeting with Mr Qian was a 'really very positive
exchange' which would boost the momentum of the talks and had increased
confidence that, although there would be problems along the way, there would
be an eventual agreement.
Mr Hurd, who said he was not visiting Beijing to make proposals or arrange a
deal, stressed to Mr Qian that the election arrangements must be 'open, fair
and acceptable to the people of Hong Kong,' and also that they should
guarantee a 'through train' to the next scheduled elections in 1999.
He referred to the so-called 'functional constituencies' which make up part
of Hong Kong's Legislative Council and to the composition of the election
committee which will also elect some seats.
Last October's proposals by Mr Patten, vehemently rejected by Beijing,
sought to increase democratic representation by broadening the electoral
franchise of both.
The two men agreed to speed up work within the joint liaison group, which is
charged with negotiating the details of Hong Kong's transfer to Chinese
sovereignty in 1997, and to quicken the pace of talks about Hong Kong's
airport project.
Mr Qian told Mr Hurd that China had no objection to the first stage of a
large land reclamation proceeding.
The foreign secretary defended pursuing a negotiated settlement with China
by claiming that an agreement would secure the 'prize' of a smooth transfer
of sovereignty in 1997.
However Mr Yeung Sum, deputy leader of Hong Kong's United Democrats, said Mr
Hurd's visit might have helped the talks along but his party was more
concerned with their outcome.
'Aspirations for democracy must not be sacrificed just for the sake of
agreement,' he said.
The Beijing meeting confirmed that Mr Qian, who made a full member of the
Chinese politburo last year, was in day-to-day charge of affairs related to
Hong Kong.
There was relief among UK officials that Britain could at last talk to China
about Hong Kong at a senior political level.

FT  10 JUL 93 / The G7 Summit: Leaders react to changing agenda
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE G7 leaders left the summit with an economic agenda markedly different
from their gatherings in the 1980s.
In the 1980s the enemy was inflation. In Tokyo their main economic concern
was structural unemployment.
To promote long-term growth they will seek to co-operate in reforming labour
markets, social security and health care systems. In the 1980s their main
focus was co-ordinating their fiscal and exchange rate policies to promote
growth.
There has also been a marked change of tone. Deregulation to liberalise
markets is no longer the overriding goal. The finance ministers' report
recommended action to promote training, control health care spending and to
limit the risks of financial deregulation. They even said there was a place
for incomes policies.
President Bill Clinton's idea of a jobs summit was warmly welcomed. Ms Kim
Campbell, the Canadian prime minister, enthused: 'It will be a think-tank of
experts to generate ideas about problems of employment in post-industrial
societies. These are problems we all face.'
Mr Carlo Ciampi, the Italian prime minister, echoed Mr Clinton's observation
that 'old economic equations' were being broken by new production
technologies. Mr Ciampi said: 'The enterprise system in industrialised
societies is being changed by new ways of combining labour and capital,
which requires our workforces to adjust to the future.'
But the summiteers' concerns extended beyond unemployment, to its
consequences for social security and health care. There was a consensus that
in these areas reforms were needed to cut costs, and possibly to narrow
entitlements, without damaging basic services.
Mr Clinton explained: 'The French economy in the 1980s was very strong in
every sphere but unemployment. Even when they were chugging along with high
growth they could not get unemployment down below 9.5 per cent. All these
countries in Europe are facing low population growth, an ageing population,
and within 10 years they will have only two people working for every person
who is retired.'
Mr Ciampi put the consequences this way: 'We all have to spend less by
spending money better. There is widespread concern in Italy about the cost
of health care and pensions.'
Ms Campbell remarked: 'Canada has the second highest health care costs in
the G7. We should consider the side effects of the way we deliver health
care without reducing services.'
Japan has low unemployment, but it faces a rapidly ageing population and
very low growth in its workforce. Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister,
implied the consequences for government finances could be sweeping: 'We are
facing a turning point. We shall soon have to review the tax system as a
whole.'
The political implications of the need for structural reform were drawn out
by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the UK chancellor. He explained that the German and US
plans to reduce their federal fiscal deficits had set a new standard for
consolidating public finances which others, such as Britain, would have to
follow.

FT  10 JUL 93 / The G7 Summit: Clinton claims summit success - The US
president got most of what he wanted
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
IF OFFICIAL hyperbole is taken at face value, each head of government
personally made the Tokyo summit a resounding success.
Mr Miyazawa, a charming host, broke the logjam in the market access talks by
throwing whisky on to the table. Messrs Mitterrand, Kohl and even Major
toughened the words condemning Serbia and Croatia. Mr Ciampi had a lot to
say about the Balkans and the Middle East, and Ms Campbell engaged the US on
beer. All, except possibly Messrs Kohl and Mitterrand, who like a little
ceremony, agreed future summits should go back to their simpler roots.
But it was President Bill Clinton who came to Tokyo with most to lose and
who is leaving it with most gained. The extent to which summits play in
Peoria or the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue may be debated but it is hard
to deny the case, advanced by every administration official round the clock,
that he got most of what he wanted.
Mr David Gergen, the new presidential counsellor and designer of a skilful
and disciplined US public relations exercise here, yesterday cited the
following achievements.
The market access agreement, a priority identified by Mr Clinton several
weeks ago, at least makes possible successful completion of the Uruguay
Round. Failure here would have made the Tokyo summit a laughing stock.
On the economy, for the first time since 1980, a summit communique did not
implicitly criticise the US for not tackling its deficit. This legitimises
Mr Clinton's claim that growth  - and jobs  - matter most, with more
Japanese fiscal stimulus and lower European interest rates tools to be used
along with US deficit reduction.
The lack of jobs is now on the international agenda, with Mr Clinton's
structural unemployment autumn conclave the next forum for debate.
The great focus of Mr Clinton's foreign policy, sustaining Russian reform,
has been endorsed with the Dollars 3bn (Pounds 2bn) privatisation programme,
achieved in spite of European and Japanese reservations and lack of
resources.
The president's preference for summits with less formality and more talk has
taken hold. As far as can be ascertained here (heads of government are
terribly discreet about other members of the club) Mr Clinton's intelligence
and charm were well received and he 'inter-acted' to good effect.
Early today, US officials added to this list by announcing that Washington
and Tokyo had struck a deal in principle on a new economic framework aimed
at putting trade between the two countries into better balance. But because
such an accord was by no means certain, officials had been more than usually
careful to keep expectations low.
Mr Clinton goes on from here to Korea and a short break in Hawaii before
flying back to Washington, where the temperature has been cracking 100
degrees. The political heat back home, with critical budget divisions
looming, will be even higher, probably making Tokyo's mildness and harmony
soon a distant memory.

FT  10 JUL 93 / The G7 Summit: Backing for open trading system
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE world's leading industrial countries yesterday threw their weight behind
a new effort to reach agreement on liberalising international trade by the
end of this year and called on other trading nations to make comparable
efforts.
At the end of this year's economic summit of the Group of Seven leading
industrial nations, the European Community, the world's largest trading
group, said it was 'determined to show leadership' to secure a completion to
the long-stalled Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations.
In their final declaration after the summit, the G7 countries  - the US,
Japan, Germany, France, Britain, Italy, Canada  - and the EC said that their
'highest priority' was a successful conclusion to the Uruguay Round.
Similar declarations have been made after past summits. But this time, the
leaders were able to anchor their aspirations in the progress towards a
market access package that was achieved earlier this week in Tokyo by
negotiators from the Quad group of countries  - the US, EC, Japan and
Canada.
The G7 statement welcomed the market access package to reduce and, in some
cases, eliminate tariffs on industrial goods and work towards opening
markets to services as a 'major step to the immediate resumption' of the
trade talks.
In their statement, the leaders urged comparable market opening measures by
other trading countries and declared that they were determined 'to curb
protectionism in all its manifestations'. They gave explicit backing to the
world's multilateral open trading system, saying countries should not have
recourse to initiatives and arrangements that threaten it.
Sir Leon Brittan, EC trade commissioner, said he would go to Geneva on
Monday to tell other trading nations about the progress on market access in
the hope of being able to relaunch the Uruguay Round negotiations. European
governments are especially keen that the fast-growing economies of Asia join
in the market opening exercise.
Sir Leon said that if the EC received substantial offers of market opening
measures, it would respond in kind.
He said the negotiators of the Quad agreement had made progress towards
liberalisation measures other than the specific tariff cuts listed in
Wednesday's agreement.
Japan, for example, had improved its offer to open its market to foreign
financial services but the EC would ask it to go further. Sir Leon said the
US, in offering to cut its tariffs on imported high-quality textiles, had
offered only about half of what the EC had demanded, but this was a
'substantial downpayment'.
This week's progress on trade was welcomed by individual G7 leaders. Mr John
Major, UK prime minister, said it was 'clearly a significant step'. Mr
Helmut Kohl, the German chancellor, said the progress on Gatt was
'encouraging'.
Even France, the most reluctant G7 participant in the trade liberalisation
process, gave the week's trade developments a guarded welcome. There was
'real progress in terms of procedure', President Francois Mitterrand said,
though only 'small openings' had been achieved in Tokyo.
The G7 said a successful and rapid conclusion of the Uruguay Round would
'boost the confidence of investors and consumers, and this would be an
important contribution to recovery and growth.'
In their final statement, the G7 leaders expressed great concern that more
than 23m are unemployed in their countries. The statement listed desirable
structural reforms to reduce barriers to jobs and growth.

FT  10 JUL 93 / The G7 Summit: Dollars 3bn fund is mostly recycled
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEYLA BOULTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Dollars 3bn (Pounds 2bn) privatisation fund offered to President Boris
Yeltsin by Group of Seven leaders yesterday is the latest illustration of
the numbers game being played by the west to demonstrate support for Russian
reforms without digging too deeply into its pocket.
Although G7 leaders successfully dodged questions as to how much of the
money was new, the bulk of the Dollars 3bn has been diverted from aid and
lending programmes announced earlier.
It includes Dollars 1bn in export credits from individual countries, two
Dollars 500m loans from the World Bank, Dollars 425m in loans and equity
investment from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, and
Dollars 100m from the International Finance Corporation, the World Bank's
hard loans arm.
Of the additional Dollars 500m in technical assistance only Dollars 125m
from the US was openly stated to be new money.
Last-minute help from the EBRD enabled the fund to be pushed up to Dollars
3bn.
In the multilateral organisation's defence, they have been hard pressed to
spend money pledged so far, given the inefficiency of the Russian
bureaucracy and the country's lack of market mechanisms for distributing
funds to newly privatised companies.

FT  10 JUL 93 / The G7 Summit: Unemployment 'sapping our strength' -
Economic communique focuses on worries about jobs and growth / Jobs become
priority
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Following are extracts from the Group of Seven economic communique issued in
Tokyo yesterday:
STRENGTHENED COMMITMENT TO JOBS AND GROWTH
1. Progress around the world towards democracy and open market economies
surpasses our most optimistic expectations of only some years ago. To reap
full benefits of recent historic transformations, our societies must respond
to a number of challenges; achieving economic recovery and job creation,
successfully concluding the Uruguay Round this year, integrating countries
in transition into the world economy, supporting developing countries and
reconciling global growth and environmental objectives. We are determined to
address these challenges. We renew our commitment to extend international
co-operation, in particular by strengthening multilateral institutions.
WORLD ECONOMY
2. We are concerned about insufficient growth and inadequate job creation in
our economies.
3. We are particularly concerned with the level of unemployment. More than
23m people are unemployed in our countries; that is unacceptable. Much of
the recent increase is attributable to the present economic slowdown, but a
significant part of the current level of unemployment is structural.
Reducing unemployment, therefore, requires a double strategy: prudent
macroeconomic policies to promote non-inflationary sustainable growth, and
structural reforms to improve the efficiency of markets, especially labour
markets.
4. We are taking and will take appropriate measures to implement this agreed
growth strategy to promote a sustainable expansion designed to create
substantial increases in employment. We will consult closely so that our
national policies can be mutually reinforcing and compatible with our shared
goal of a strengthened and recovering world economy.
Europe is carrying out vigorously the Growth Initiative agreed in Edinburgh
and strengthened in Copenhagen. Europe is committed as a matter of
overriding importance to implementing firm budgetary and other measures
needed in order to ensure that conditions for rapid reductions in interest
rates are created.
In North America, strong actions, which have been long overdue in the US and
which we welcome, are being taken to ensure substantial and steady
reductions in fiscal deficits over the medium term, higher level of domestic
savings and investment, and lower long-term interest rates.
Japan has taken a series of stimulative policies including the most recent
comprehensive package. Japan will implement fiscal and monetary measures as
necessary, to ensure sustained non-inflationary growth led by strong
domestic demand, keeping in mind the need for long-term fiscal prudence.
This will contribute to the important goal of significantly reducing
external imbalances.
Successful and rapid conclusion of the Uruguay Round will also boost the
confidence of investors and consumers, and thus will be an important
contribution to recovery and growth.
5. To enhance opportunities for employment and growth it is essential to
address structural issues which constitute obstacles to strong economic
recovery and to longer-term growth potential. In this context, we endorse
the report of our finance ministers focussing on a broad range of structural
reforms, inter alia:
Greater labour market efficiency;
Improvement in education and training;
Enhancement of savings and investment;
Maintaining and improving the multilateral trading system;
Reduction of subsidies;
Addressing the economic impact of ageing populations;
Controlling overall outlays on health care;
Enhancing efficiency in financial markets while ensuring their stability;
Developing international co-operation on the environment.
6. We agree to send representatives to a meeting in the US in the autumn to
explore the causes of excessive unemployment and to search for possible
answers to this critical problem which saps the strength of our societies.
TRADE
7. Maintaining and expanding the multilateral trading system is essential
for world growth. We are determined to curb protectionism in all its
manifestations and agree that no recourse should be made to initiatives and
arrangements that threaten to undermine the multilateral open trading
system. We also confirm that any regional integration should be
complementary to and supportive of the system. Our highest priority is a
successful conclusion to the Uruguay Round.
ENVIRONMENT
8. Environmental issues remain a high priority on our policy agenda despite
difficult economic times.
RUSSIA AND THE OTHER COUNTRIES IN TRANSITION
9. We reaffirm our support for the reform efforts in the countries in
transition. . . based on the principles of help for self-help and
partnership.
10. We welcome the further progress made by Russia since Munich in its
courageous reform efforts under the leadership of President Yeltsin and
supported by the Russian people in the recent referendum. We urge Russia to
intensify its efforts to reduce inflation and the budget deficit, and to
take all the necessary legal and administrative measures to build on the
strong start in privatisation and to promote further structural adjustment.
We recognise the importance of improved market access for economic progress
in Russia.
Recognising that privatisation and enterprise reform are at the heart of
Russia's transformation into a market economy, we agree to create a Special
Privatisation and Restructuring Programme, in co-operation with
international financial institutions, consisting of enterprise restructuring
support, technical assistance and oblast support, focusing on an initial
period to the end of 1994. In total, this programme is expected to mobilise
Dollars 3bn. In addition, we are ready to encourage our private sectors to
assist in this process, sharing with Russian counterparts methods and
techniques to increase productivity.
11. We welcome the progress made in the nuclear safety programme agreed at
the Munich Summit. Urgent safety measures, co-ordinated through the G24,
need to be implemented rapidly to secure real improvements at the plants
still causing great concern.
DEVELOPING COUNTRIES
13. We will pursue a comprehensive approach, covering not only aid but also
trade, investment and debt strategy, and a differentiated approach, tailored
to needs and performances of each country and taking environmental aspects
into account. INTERNATIONAL CO-OPERATION AND FUTURE SUMMITS
16. We value summits for the opportunity they provide to exchange views,
build consensus and deepen understanding among us. But we believe summits
should be less ceremonial, with fewer people, documents and declarations,
and with more time devoted to informal discussion among us, so that together
we may better respond to major issues of common concern. We intend to
conduct future summits in this spirit. We have accepted the invitation. . .
to meet in Naples, Italy, in July 1994.

FT  10 JUL 93 / The G7 Summit: In a world of change, the Japanese remember
their manners - Jurek Martin revisits his old haunts in Tokyo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THE only constant in life these days, Bill Clinton says with every other
sentence, is change. The question for this correspondent, who has not lived
in Japan for seven years, is whether Tokyo has suffered some kind of
mutation.
The powers of observation this week have necessarily been limited. Summits
are all about massaging journalists with briefings 36 hours a day, all
because everybody reporting from Tokyo, except the Japanese themselves, have
bizarre deadlines. But escapes from the cocoon were possible.
Physically the capital has long been in a state of permanent flux, even
without earthquakes. The nice, rickety, three-bedroom house not far from the
Diet that was home for four years is now another anonymous office bulding.
The vast Komatsu earth mover perched on top of a building in Akasaka has
been replaced by an even larger Spanish galleon. At least that seemed to be
the case late one night, but neither was there next morning.
Probably both were holograms, since there appears no commercial market for
Komatsu galleons these days and tractor sales are not what they were.
Possibly the Japanese, anticipating zero tariffs on imported distilled
spirits, have started adding interesting hallucinogens to the home-grown
product.
The good things of Tokyo certainly have not changed. A return to a
much-loved little neighbourhood restaurant was like the warmest of second
homecomings - and the menu and the prices, in yen, much as they were. A
favourite bar was like an old shoe. The Foreign Correspondents Club is still
deeply politicking - but thinking of installing a marble floor.
At the Okura Hotel, as ever seriously discreet and distinguished, the
western breakfast remains curiously inedible - and 15 times as expensive as
the fry-up obtainable at any decent American roadhouse. It must be a work of
Japanese art, or a non-tariff barrier, to render all eggs and all bacon
without flavour.
The bubble economy has burst, but has left no mark on male clothing. A
personal lunchtime survey of Kasumigaseki, where civil servants wait for the
green light at crossroads, revealed a familiar sea of whiteness  - to be
precise, 94 of 100 shirts were solid or off white, five blue-ish, and one
shocking pink with bright brown brogues (probably a Finance Ministry
mandarin). However, ties are more colourful and the white sock count was
down to 23.
There was one sign that things had changed. Traffic accidents used to be
rare and minor, probably because vehicles do not go fast in jams. But the
press bus from Haneda airport and a truck had a disabling shunt, at speed.
Glass flew and the uniformed stewardess in the pill-box hat was cut. But it
was all right in the end. The truck and the bus drivers, though shaken, did
not scream and yell at each other or whip .44 Magnums out of the glove
compartment. They apologised - to each other, to the police, to the hacks,
to the rubberneckers. Japan has not changed as a civil society.

<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Boris Yeltsin yesterday failed to extract from leaders of the
world's seven richest industrialised nations an end to 'discrimination'
against Russian exports but expressed satisfaction with a Dollars 3bn fund
to support Russian privatisation.
Having said all along that his main task at the summit was to gain better
access to western markets, the Russian leader admitted afterwards that his
biggest disappointment was that 'in response to my energetic urging' they
answered ''yes, yes, we understand but it is difficult to solve this
problem''.
Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, said, the Russian leader recognised
the need for his country to make more progress with market reforms - for
instance, in getting rid of some of the 'extraordinary subsidies they have
there' - in order to claim the same treatment as members of Gatt, which
Russia has applied to join.
The G7 economic declaration simply promised yesterday to support Russia's
application to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and to 'intensify'
efforts to remove cold war restrictions on sensitive exports to former
communist countries.
Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the Russian foreign minister, confirmed that plans were
afoot to transform Cocom, the Paris based watchdog for sensitive exports to
former communist countries, into an agency, including Russia, to prevent the
proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.
Describing the new privatisation fund as 'the most concrete result of the
summit', Mr Yeltsin said he was also pleased at having been treated as an
equal by the G7 leaders, who invited him to attend their summit next year in
Naples.
'You understand, there was not this atmosphere of a student being taught by
teachers  .. but one of equality and mutual respect,' he said. He added he
was in no hurry for the G7 to become the G8 but he was sure it would happen
with time.
Mr Yeltsin promised his Japanese hosts that he would 'definitely' pay an
official visit to Japan in October despite cancelling twice in the past
year. But he said he had warned Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister,
against expectation of fast progress in retrieving the Kurile Islands,
seized by Soviet troops at the end of the second world war.
He said Japan should co-operate more in assisting economic reforms so that
Russians will live better and be more relaxed about a solution of the
territorial question.

market access package that was achieved earlier this week in Tokyo by
negotiators from the Quad group of countries - the US, EC, Japan and Canada.
The G7 statement welcomed the market access package to reduce and, in some
cases, eliminate tariffs on industrial goods and work towards opening
markets to services as a 'major step to the immediate resumption' of the
trade talks.
In their statement, the leaders urged comparable market opening measures by
other trading countries and declared that they were determined 'to curb
protectionism in all its manifestations'. They gave explicit backing to the
world's multilateral open trading system, saying countries should not have
recourse to initiatives and arrangements that threaten it.
Sir Leon Brittan, EC trade commissioner, said he would go to Geneva on
Monday to tell other trading nations about the progress on market access in
the hope of being able to relaunch the Uruguay Round negotiations. European
governments are especially keen that the fast-growing economies of Asia join
in the market opening exercise.
Sir Leon said that if the EC received substantial offers of market opening
measures, it would respond in kind.
He said the negotiators of the Quad agreement had made progress towards
liberalisation measures other than the specific tariff cuts listed in
Wednesday's agreement.
Japan, for example, had improved its offer to open its market to foreign
financial services but the EC would ask it to go further. Sir Leon said the
US, in offering to cut its tariffs on imported high-quality textiles, had
offered only about half of what the EC had demanded, but this was a
'substantial downpayment'.
This week's progress on trade was welcomed by individual G7 leaders. Mr John
Major, UK prime minister, said it was 'clearly a significant step'. Mr
Helmut Kohl, the German chancellor, said the progress on Gatt was
'encouraging'.
Even France, the most reluctant G7 participant in the trade liberalisation
process, gave the week's trade developments a guarded welcome. There was
'real progress in terms of procedure', President Francois Mitterrand said,
though only 'small openings' had been achieved in Tokyo.
The G7 said a successful and rapid conclusion of the Uruguay Round would
'boost the confidence of investors and consumers, and this would be an
important contribution to recovery and growth.'
In their final statement, the G7 leaders expressed great concern that more
than 23m are unemployed in their countries. The statement listed desirable
structural reforms to reduce barriers to jobs and growth.

FT  10 JUL 93 / Franc falls closer to ERM floor: Bank intervenes to bolster
French currency as Balladur says it will not leave EMS
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN and JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE BANK of France yesterday intervened on foreign exchange markets to
support the franc after the currency again came under heavy selling pressure
inside the European exchange rate mechanism.
The intervention was the first by the French authorities in nearly five
months, and came on a day of very strong selling of other European
currencies by international investors who sought to buy D-Marks.
Mr Edouard Balladur, the French prime minister, tried to allay concern about
the franc by affirming that his government was 'totally determined' to
maintain the stability of the French currency within the European monetary
system.
The prime minister, who had on Thursday night denounced rumours that the
franc would leave the EMS as 'farcical', said French authorities would use
'every available means' to support the franc given that monetary stability
was critical to his administration's economic and social policies. But there
was a strong impression in financial markets that the franc could face
another round of speculation next week unless the Bundesbank cut its
short-term interest rates, a move that would help France to ease monetary
policy and stimulate its economy.
Yesterday's intervention was said to be discreet, with the Bank of France
buying only small quantities of francs.
The operation failed to stop the franc falling below FFr3.40 to the D-Mark,
little more than 3 centimes above its ERM floor of FFr3.433. The franc
closed in London at FFr3.399, compared with FFr3.395 on Thursday, but
slipped further in late trading in New York to FFr3.402.
The fall in the franc came as French short-term interest rates rose sharply
 - last night trading above German money market rates for the first time in
nearly two months.
In recent weeks, French leaders had expressed pleasure that their country's
money market rates had fallen below German levels, because this implied
dealers were more confident about investing in the French currency.
Economists in Paris played down concern about the franc's prospects.
Ms Dominique Graber, deputy chief economist at Paribas, said yesterday's
pressure mainly reflected selling by foreign investors who were 'confused
about the French government's economic policy' and about the role of the
Bank of France once it becomes independent of the government. 'There are
lots of rumours around. But it would be a slight exaggeration to compare the
present situation with the heavy pressure on the franc last September and
earlier this year.'

FT  10 JUL 93 / Tiphook calls for share fall probe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TIPHOOK, the UK transport rental company, yesterday asked the London Stock
Exchange to investigate trading in its shares after the price fell suddenly
in controversial circumstances for the second time in only three months.
The shares had already fallen by 44p to 284p yesterday afternoon when the
company announced to the exchange that its 1992-93 results, to be reported
next week, would include 'significant changes to accounting policies'. The
shares recovered slightly to close 40p down at 288p.
The sudden fall bore resemblance to a precipitous slide in April only days
before Tiphook made a profits warning.
At that time, Mr Paul Myners, chairman of Gartmore Investment Management,
said there was 'prima facie' evidence of insider dealing and suggested that
nothing would emerge from a formal investigation. He had no comment
yesterday.
The exchange said yesterday it would automatically look at a big fall in a
company's share price. It has already been looking at allegations of insider
dealing.
Tiphook's statement yesterday said: 'The results for the year-end to April
will include significant changes to accounting policies, principles and
interpretation, which will bring the company's reporting more into line with
US accounting principles.'
It added later that it wanted to 'ascertain if there was any reason for the
fall' in its share price. One explanation put forward by a financier close
to Tiphook is that bankers got wind of the decision to change accounting
policy.
British institutional investors have been concerned about Tiphook's trading
performance and volatile share price since the company's rights issue in
1990.
So far this year, TSB, Fidelity and Gartmore have each reduced their
shareholdings to below 3 per cent.
These shareholders have been replaced largely by US investors, who now hold
at least 18.7 per cent in the form of American Depository Receipts.
Before news of the accounting change, analysts had been expecting Tiphook's
pre-tax profits to be down from Pounds 86m to about Pounds 75m.

FT  10 JUL 93 / PM warns of difficult decisions on social spending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN and RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR yesterday said Britain was far from alone in facing tough
decisions on public spending as he prefaced his party's Christchurch
by-election campaign by saying voters preferred 'home truths' to 'empty
promises'.
Speaking in Tokyo before returning to Britain last night, the prime minister
shrugged off gloomy opinion polls and said discussions at the Tokyo summit
of the Group of Seven leading industrial nations had vindicated his
determination to control social expenditure.
Britain's 'supply side' approach to creating jobs and fostering economic
growth had also been endorsed, he added.
Speaking only hours before Sir Norman Fowler, Conservative party chairman,
launched the campaign at Christchurch, Dorset, where a third of the
population are pensioners, Mr Major said all G7 countries except Japan
needed to cut their budget deficits. This would have repercussions on social
spending.
'All of us need to keep social costs within the bounds of what we can
afford,' Mr Major said. 'It will mean difficult decisions . . . Provided
people understand what lies behind them and what the impact of them will be,
I think people will prefer those home truths rather than empty promises.'
Mr Major insisted the poorest sections of the population had nothing to fear
from prospective cuts in social spending.
However, the Department of Social Security is understood to be looking at
options such as giving incentives to under-30s to opt out of the state
pension scheme.
Labour and the Liberal Democrats believe the Tories have made a tactical
error in highlighting the public spending review when facing an important
by-election test, caused by the death of Mr Robert Adley. The Tories had a
majority of 23,000 in Christchurch at the last election.
A Gallup opinion poll in the Daily Telegraph yesterday put the Tories in
third place nationally, behind Labour and the Liberal Democrats and Mr
Major's personal rating at a record low for a prime minister.
Speaking in Christchurch, Sir Norman Fowler, said: 'We're comfortable with
the position where the opinion polls show us as underdogs.'
In Tokyo, Mr Major maintained that 'short-term sensational matters' were
damaging the government's popularity at a time when Britain was experiencing
low inflation, falling unemployment and had interest rates down at 6 per
cent.

British scientists said bones found in Yekaterinburg, Russia, were almost
certainly those of the murdered Tsar Nicholas II and his family, thought to
have been shot in 1918 after the Bolshevik revolution. Genetic
fingerprinting tests showed 'almost a 99 per cent probability' that the
bones were those of the Romanovs, the researchers said. The remains were
brought to Britain by scientist Dr Pavel Ivanov, who also helped in the
identification process.

FT  10 JUL 93 / G7 backs new effort to secure success in trade talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE world's leading industrial countries yesterday concluded their three-day
economic summit, agreeing that the 'highest priority' was a successful
conclusion to talks on liberalising world trade.
The Group of Seven leading industrial nations - the US, Japan, Germany,
France, Britain, Italy, Canada - issued a communique supporting a new effort
to reach agreement by the end of this year in the Uruguay Round of
multilateral trade talks under the aegis of the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade.
The communique also said they had agreed to promote long term growth by
trying to co-operate in reforming labour markets, social security and health
care systems.
'All of us are mindful that we have a long way to go to restore real growth
and opportunity to the global economy, but we have made a serious start,' US
President Bill Clinton said.
He cited Wednesday's agreement by the US, Canada, Japan and the European
Community to reduce or eliminate import tariffs on a range of manufactured
goods, which he said would help bring global trade talks to a successful
conclusion.
On Russia, Mr Clinton said the Dollars 3bn (Pounds 2bn) programme to help
privatise state-owned industries 'will not only bolster prospects for
freedom there, it is a very solid investment for the US'.
Mr John Major, the British prime minister, said the summit, with its
progress on trade, had been better 'than I anticipated and better than most
people expected'. He also secured agreement to make future summits more
informal.
The meeting would have a catalytic effect on the trade talks, help to
restore confidence and growth, and create jobs, he added.
Mr Clinton will leave Tokyo this morning for South Korea, probably without
Japan's agreement to use numerical targets to open its markets to imports
and reduce its trade surplus.
Reporting on last night's dinner between Mr Clinton and Mr Kiichi Miyazawa,
the Japanese prime minister, Mr David Gergen, the White House counsellor,
said the two leaders had only 'touched on' the question of what is known as
the framework agreement. They had agreed to leave matters in the hands of
their ministers.
Negotiations were continuing overnight, he said, and were 'quite fluid'. But
Mr Clinton 'has not yet seen any piece of paper'. Mr Gergen said it was
'within the realms of possibility' that there would be an announcement
before Mr Clinton leaves for Seoul, but it was equally possible that nothing
would be forthcoming.
The president, he said, would have to approve what could be a complicated
document and was also due to attend bilateral talks with Russian President
Boris Yeltsin this morning.
US officials have been careful not to raise expectations that such an
important deal could be reached in Tokyo with a Japanese government facing
elections next week. The US has felt that it is better to sign a solid
agreement than a hasty one.
Japanese officials said the talks on a proposed trade framework had narrowed
the differences between the two governments but had not eliminated them.
Even late yesterday afternoon Mr Miyazawa was sending his negotiators
revised instructions.

FT  09 JUL 93 / Portuguese government seeks Es3,500bn from EC
</HEADLINE>

   LISBON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Portuguese government will seek Es3,500bn (Dollars 21.7bn) in structural
funds from the European Community for the period 1994 to 1999, Mr Anibal
Cavaco Silva, prime minister, has announced, writes Peter Wise in Lisbon.
The request, which will be submitted to Brussels in the near future, is
thought to have been prompted as an early move in the face of the Irish
rejection of the planned division of EC structural funds among the four
poorest members states, Ireland, Greece, Portugal and Spain.
Mr Cavaco Silva said the EC funds would mobilise Es6,580bn in investment,
representing 28 per cent of the total investment in the Portuguese economy
over the next six years. This would mean public investment growing at a rate
of 8 per cent a year and private investment at 5.5-6.5 per cent a year.

FT  09 JUL 93 / Hungary raises interest rates, devalues forint
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
HUNGARY yesterday devalued the forint by 3 per cent and announced a 3 per
cent rise in a key interest rate.
The Hungarian currency is linked to a basket divided equally between the
dollar and the Ecu, and National Bank of Hungary passed off the devaluation
as a 'technical step' in response to the dollar's rise against European
currencies.
This devaluation follows a 1.9 per cent devaluation in June, adding to
speculation that the Hungarian authorities' exchange rate policy is
softening.
Pressure for a fundamental shift in policy has been growing as Hungarian
exports have fallen and the external trade balance deteriorated.
Exports in the first four months were down 27.2 per cent compared with a
year earlier, depressed by recession in Hungary's main markets of Germany
and Austria.
The current account deficit amounted to Dollars 423m for the first two
months, leading some analysts to estimate that the shortfall for the year
could be as high as Dollars 2bn, about 8 per cent of gross domestic product.
The NBH is financing the deficit with a record spree on international
capital markets. Yesterday the central bank announced two more bond issues -
a five-year Y50bn (Dollars 460m) bond in Tokyo and a Pounds 100m (Dollars
66m) bond in London. These latest issues take the NBH's borrowings for the
year so far to Dollars 2.7bn.
Despite the deterioration in Hungary's external balance, recent bond issues
have sold relatively well and rating agency Standard &amp; Poor's said yesterday
it had reaffirmed the NBH's BB plus rating.
The Hungarian authorities yesterday sought to offset the inflationary impact
of the devaluation with a 3 per cent rise in the central bank's open market
security repurchase rates.
Raising interest rates should ease the government's difficulties in
financing its large budget deficit at a time when savings are dropping.
The conservative government's proposal to increase value added tax on food
and other basic items survived a parliamentary vote on Wednesday with a
majority of 13 votes. Despite the anticipated revenues from VAT, this week's
emergency budget still leaves Hungary needing to finance a public-sector
deficit of 6.8 per cent of GDP this year.
An International Monetary Fund delegation is in Budapest and is expected to
respond to the latest economic moves today.

FT  09 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHILE German and French futures markets notched up strong performances, the
September contract on the FT-SE 100 could only stand on the sidelines and
watch, ending two points down at 2,849 from its previous day's close, writes
Christine Buckley.
Traders were disappointed in its showing - which was also set against a
buoyant Wall Street - and volume was thin at 7,741 contracts.
American players made a significant dent with their desertion of the UK
contract in favour of buying into Germany's market. A general lack of buyers
was also blamed for dull action in stock index futures.
The contract hit its trading high in mid-morning, rising just above the
2,859 mark.
One trader said that its poor achievement could be explained partially by
the fact that it had to drag itself up from a low of the previous day of
2,828, but even that, in the face of strong markets abroad, did not excuse a
'lousy rally'.
September started the day at 2,851 and its close of 2,849 left it at about 4
points below its fair value premium to cash, which is around 7 points.
Life was slightly faster in traded options, with a respectable volume of
32,387 lots against the previous day's 22,075. Stock options had some
strength, with Hanson at 4,189 lots and Tesco at 3,243. The FT-SE 100 option
saw 5,448 contracts change hands.

FT  09 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: Euro Disney falls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, JOEL KIBAZO, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The gloom surrounding Euro Disney increased sharply as the theme park owner
company warned that the third quarter would result in losses of about
FFr500m and its fourth quarter would also be in loss. The warnings confirmed
leisure analysts' worst fears, which had been sustained since the park's
opening by a stream of negative official and independent figures. The shares
retreated 108 to 675p.
British Aerospace added 3 at 402p after announcing a Pounds 1.4bn five-year
revolving credit facility to refinance its existing bank lines and to extend
its debt maturity profile. One analyst said: 'This should facilitate the
group's restructuring and put it in a stronger position.' A squeeze in
Smiths Industries saw the shares gain 6 at 371p.
Reports that engineering group Vickers was about to announce a 25 per cent
increase in production of Rolls-Royce cars helped the shares rise 5 to 150p.
VSEL jumped 36 to 866p after a single buyer bought around 150,000 shares at
860p. That done, the shares surrendered some of the earlier gains, finishing
29 up at 859p.
Guinness reacted favourably to news from the G7 summit on lower whisky
tariffs. Analysts said it could add Pounds 10m to the drinks group's
operating profits. The shares moved up 4 to 470p.
Food retailers continued under a cloud, with talk of more downgrades. Asda
eased a halfpenny to 61 3/4 p and J. Sainsbury declined 9 to 447p.
There was further good two-way business in Forte, the shares fading 4 at the
close to 222p in turnover of 8.8m.
A bear squeeze and switching from Dixons lifted Kingfisher 14 to 609p.
Volume in British Gas jumped to 10m and the shares closed 3 1/2 cheaper at
291 1/2 p after the company said it had postponed plans to increase charges
to Gas suppliers who use existing pipelines.
The weakness in crude oil prices as dealers waited for the outcome of talks
between the United Nations and Iraq unsettled several stocks in the sector.
Enterprise Oil shed 6 to 457p and Shell Transport slipped 2 to 613p.
Reuters suffered from pre-results nerves and receded 20 to 1388p ahead of
its interims due on July 27.
Investors warmed to the results from Peel Holdings, which also announced the
conclusion of successful talks with its bankers. The shares moved ahead 23
to 233p. MEPC also stood out in a reasonably confident property sector,
showing an increase of 15 to 426p on the back of its rights issue success.
Sentiment switched from the recently favoured television stocks. NatWest's
caution moved the price of Central Television down 28 to 2030p, and did the
same for Yorkshire-Tyne Tees TV, which tumbled 8 to 205p. Anglia TV declined
7 to 338p and Scottish TV lost 6 to 542p.
A round of revived bid rumours resurfaced to focus attention on Pilkington
and the glass group saw its share price add 3 1/2 at 130p in a turnover of
3.9m.
But some analysts poured scorn on the credence of the rumours - which pop up
at regular intervals in the market - and instead pointed a finger at
interest from the US. American buyers are believed to be increasingly
friendly towards the stock.
Further optimism about the banking sector ahead of the interim reporting
season inspired continued buying of bank shares. Lloyds, which reports at
the end of this month, climbed 8 to 570p and Barclays edged 3 ahead to 491p,
while National Westminster gained 5 1/2 at 493p.
It was an optimistic view on talks between Hong Kong and China which brought
renewed interest in HSBC and Standard Chartered. The former strengthened 10
1/2 to 665 1/2 p, while the latter advanced 11 to 789p.
International mining group RTZ followed the market lower, closing a penny
off at 681p, having been 7 ahead at the day's peak after a Smith New Court
recommendation.
International conglomerate Hanson remained in demand following its
announcement at the end of last month that it is to acquire Quantum
Chemical, of the US. The shares ended 3 higher at 230 3/4 p in sizeable
volume of 19m. The stock was also busy in the traded options, where the
equivalent of just over 4m shares were also dealt.
Support was strong for wool group Sirdar, which appreciated 6 to 101p.
Two way business in Rolls-Royce brought volume of 2m as the shares closed
unchanged at 138p. Just before the market close, Moody's Investor Services,
the US credit rating agency, said it had lowered the rating on the senior
debt of Rolls-Royce Plc to A3 from A2 to reflect the weakness of the
commercial and military jet engines market.
A buy recommendation from Credit Lyonnais Laing boosted electrical
engineering group GEC, the shares closing 3 firmer at 318p. The securities
house said: 'The share price may have doubled over the last 18 months, but
the shares are still attractive by reference to cash generation and the
strong order book.'

Shares in British Airways lost ground after US investment bank Goldman Sachs
weighed in with a savage profits downgrading.
The stock had eased with the market, but news that Goldman's US based
airlines specialist had cut his forecast sent the shares further into
retreat, ending 10 lighter at 297p after trade of 3.8m.
Mr Glenn Engel at the investment bank reduced current year expectations by
Pounds 100m to Pounds 175m, but only shaved the figure for the year to March
1995 by Pounds 20m to Pounds 285m. He said: 'I remain very concerned about
the passenger and cargo yields. There is no growth in Europe, yet the supply
(of seats) is increasing, which will lead to pressure on prices.' In
addition, he thought that with corporate budgets still under pressure, the
recovery in premium traffic would be slow.

FT  09 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: Owners crashes on warning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, JOEL KIBAZO, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOLIDAY stocks were rocked by two numbing announcements yesterday, with
profits warnings from both Owners Abroad and Euro Disney sending the two
groups' shares sharply lower and leading other related stocks down. The most
dramatic statement came from Owners as it revealed that full-year results
would probably be around half what the market was expecting.
Although the revelation came just 45 minutes before the market closed,
Owners still managed a 48 per cent fall. It staged a slight recovery to
close at 66p, a dramatic decline of 32 1/2 in brisk turnover of 2.6m. Only
around 100,000 shares had been traded prior to the announcement.
This latest development at the UK's second biggest tour operator will be yet
another blow to the company's credibility in the market. Shortly after it
had closely fought off the bid from Airtours earlier this year, Owners
angered analysts by advising them to lower their profits estimates, which
had been a cornerstone of their defence against Airtours. Cuts to around
Pounds 27m were made then. Yesterday, the more gloomier analysts were
predicting that Owners would be lucky to break Pounds 10m.
In a statement issued after the market closed, Airtours said that Owners'
excuses that a fall-off in demand had contributed to their problems flew in
the face of its own estimates of a 6 per cent growth this year. Hoare Govett
had similar figures, and Mr Hamish Dickson, the broker's leisure analyst,
said: 'They obviously took their eye off the ball during the Airtours bid.'
In spite of the sweeping management changes made yesterday, leisure
specialists forecast more downside to the shares. But late market gossip
suggested that Owners' biggest shareholder, the German travel group LTU,
whose 29.99 per cent stake was largely bought at up to 150p a share during
the Airtours bid, may yet come to the rescue with a full offer.
Airtours lost 3 1/2 to 334p, Eurocamp, which itself issued a profits warning
last week, fell 6 to 187p and Scottish &amp; Newcastle, which owns Centre Parcs,
dipped 5 to 459p.

FT  09 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: Switching operation upsets equities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LONDON'S equity market refused stubbornly to build on Wednesday's late rally
and ended a difficult day marginally lower on balance amid ominous rumours
that a number of the big international institutions had been switching funds
out of UK equities and into German equities and bonds.
The two markets were easily the top performers in the world, with dealers in
London still taking the view that there is scope for further interest rate
cuts in the near future.
The German market's latest burst of strength was said to have been the
catalyst for a good showing by French equities. London, however, struggled
throughout the day, with dealers increasingly suspicious that a series of
hefty selling programmes in London could have represented the shift of funds
from the UK to the Continent.
'There is no doubt that there has been some big selling of the leaders, via
the cash market and the futures, and the story is that the cash is moving
out to Germany,' said one leading London dealer. There were also rumours
circulating in London of further big rights issues in the pipeline, although
there were no obvious candidates being put forward yesterday.
The FT-SE 100 Index, which staged a good rally late on Wednesday, made a
promising start to the session, opening some three points higher at 2,851.3
in spite of intermittent bouts of profit-taking, and moved up to touch the
day's highest level of 2,855.7 for a rise of 7.4 as the morning session drew
to a close.
Afternoon trading, however, brought a complete reversal in sentiment in
London, with the FT-SE 100 future coming under pressure and the underlying
market embarking on a gradual decline which saw the Footsie fall to the
day's low of 2,842.2. Wall Street's strong opening performance failed to
prevent the late slide in UK share prices. A flurry of bear closing in the
last few minutes of the trading session saw the index end a difficult day a
net 2.4 off at 2,845.9.
The FT-SE Mid 250 Index performed much better than the senior index, closing
6.5 higher at 3,226.4, indicating, according to dealers, that institutions
had carried out their initial switching via the highly liquid blue chip
stocks. A similar reaction in the second-liners is expected shortly.
Equity market specialists pointed out that the shift in sentiment in the
market, and the sudden turnround, was accompanied by a sharp increase in
volumes in the market.
Turnover yesterday was 577.6m shares, almost matching Wednesday's 586m and
ahead of Tuesday's 554.3m and Monday's dismal 384m. The value of customer
business on Wednesday moved back above Pounds 1bn, the level at which
London's securities industry is seen to move into profitability. On the
first two trading days this week turnover reached Pounds 761m and Pounds
960m respectively.
A dismal day for the leisure sector began with a profits warning from
EuroDisney, prompting a big slide in the shares, and ended with a disastrous
statement from Owners Abroad, which only survived a takeover attempt from
fellow holiday company Airtours last March by the narrowest of margins. Talk
in the market last night suggested deep unease over Owners' tactics in
fending off the Airtours bid.

FT  09 JUL 93 / World Stock Markets: North Americans excited by casino
building craze - But the boom is blurring the distinction between gambling
and investment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nowhere has the distinction between investing and gambling become more
blurred than in the high-stakes performance of casino operators listed on
North American stock exchanges.
The confusion is evident even in the names of the companies which are raking
in investors' money. Goldrush Casino &amp; Mining Corporation is one of this
year's most heavily traded and volatile shares on the Vancouver exchange.
The hottest performers on US markets include such companies as Casino Magic
and Boomtown.
Goldrush, which hopes to strike it rich with casinos in Colorado, Las Vegas
and the Caribbean, soared from a low of CDollars 3.05 in April to a peak of
CDollars 20.25 in June, with more than 7.5m shares changing hands in the
past three months. By this week the share price had tumbled back to CDollars
12.50.
The wheel has spun equally erratically for the veteran US gaming palaces
centred on Las Vegas and Atlantic City. Shares of Circus Circus Enterprises
have jumped more than 50 per cent on Wall Street in the past year to above
USDollars 60. The shares will be split three-for-two later this month.
But Morgan Stanley downgraded its rating on the company yesterday from buy
to hold, and the shares showed an immediate fall of Dollars 4 1/8 to Dollars
54 3/4 .
Caesar's World has bounced over the past 12 months between a low of Dollars
28.13 and a peak of Dollars 50.88. It presently trades at about Dollars
41.75.
Almost a dozen casino operators are listed in New York, and three in
Vancouver. Investors on the Toronto Stock Exchange can put their chips on
Dion Entertainment Corpor-ation, which is using the experience it has gained
in 17 bingo halls on the Canadian prairies to expand into fully fledged
casinos.
The casino boom stems largely from a drive among hard-pressed regional and
local governments to broaden their tax base without raising politically
sensitive income or property taxes.
The Canadian province of Ontario recently called for bids for its first
casino, to be built in Windsor, across the border from Detroit. The
provincial government will keep 20 per cent of gross revenues, as well as
any profits left over after expenses and a management fee paid to the
operator.
In the US, prospects for casino operators have been buoyed by a flood of
licences for floating 'riverboat casinos'. Mr John Rohs, an analyst at
Wertheim Schroder in New York, points to a 'domino effect', in which the
legalisation of gambling in one state inexorably puts pressure on its
neighbours to follow suit. For instance, if Windsor, Ontario, has a casino,
can Detroit be far behind?
In addition, several dozen Indian bands in both countries are turning to
casinos as a sure and recession-proof way of raising money for their
communities.
Mr Rohs is confident that the proliferation of casinos is far from over, and
that share prices will rise further. But he advises investors to place most
of their bets with the well-established industry stalwarts. His current
recommendations include Mirage Resorts and Promus Companies.
Others are nervous, however, that the wheel of fortune may be about to stop.
Mr Douglas Taylor of National Securities in Seattle describes the casino
craze as a 'big fad'. Noting that the market value of some of the newcomers
already matches that of a medium-sized airline, Mr Taylor declares that 'the
entire population of the US is going to have to gamble once a day to keep
these people going'.
One sign that the gambling instinct may have overtaken sound investment
judgment is that one of the biggest buyers of Goldrush Casino &amp; Mining
shares on the Vancouver Stock Exchange has been reported as a group known as
the High Rollers Investment Club.

Wall Street
PROGRAM buying contributed to a strong rally on Wall Street yesterday as
investors respon-ded to positive economic reports and equities continued to
recover from their recent losses, writes Karen Zagor in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 38.75 higher at 3,514.42, after
breaking through the 3,500 level at noon. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 advanced
5.81 to 448.64 and the Nasdaq composite rose 3.92 to 702.71. New York SE
volume reached 284m shares, while rises led falls by 1,283 to 715.
Investors took heart after weekly unemployment claims showed a sharper than
expected fall. The market was also encouraged by improved same-store sales
for June from a number of large US retailers.
Woolworth, however, dipped Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 27 1/8 after warning
investors that it would post disappointing second-quarter earnings. The
retailer reported a slight decline in domestic same-store sales for June.
Sears climbed Dollars 1 7/8 to a 52-week high of Dollars 58 after unveiling
a strong improvement in comparable store sales for June. Wal-Mart moved
forward Dollars 1 to Dollars 26 1/2 and JC Penney appreciated Dollars 1 7/8
to Dollars 45 1/8 .
Nike rose Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 55 3/4 in active trading after the
athletic shoe and apparel maker predicted single-digit growth for the
current fiscal year. The company also authorised a stock buyback plan of up
to Dollars 450m in class 'B' common stock. Reebok, Nike's main rival, put on
Dollars  7/8 at Dollars 28 1/8 , while LA Gear firmed Dollars  3/8 to
Dollars 10 1/2 .
Walt Disney was finally up Dollars  1/8 at Dollars 38 3/4 after losing
ground in the morning following a delayed opening as the company's Euro
Disney operations posted disappointing earnings.
Newmont Mining lost Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 53 7/8 , after falling Dollars
3 3/8 a day earlier. Late on Wednesday a secondary offering of 9.65m common
shares in the company was priced at Dollars 54 3/4 a share through
underwriters led by Salomon Brothers.
In the technology sector, IBM held steady at Dollars 46 5/8 and
Hewlett-Packard advanced Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 78 3/4 , but Digital
Equipment edged Dollars  3/4 lower to Dollars 38 1/2 .
Airline issues rallied after Wednesday's weakness, with AMR, parent of
American Airlines, rising Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 61 7/8 and Delta Dollars
1 1/2 to Dollars 47 7/8 , but UAL eased Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 124 1/4 .
In Nasdaq trading, Microsoft rose Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 84 7/8 and Intel
climbed Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 54 3/4 .
Canada
TORONTO posted its largest one-day loss for about 33 months, led by steep
declines in gold and energy stocks.
The TSE 300 index dropped 51.9 to close at 3,920.9. Declines outnumbered
advances by 542 to 238 after volume of 70m shares valued at CDollars 795.9m.
The gold shares index fell 5.2 per cent and the energy group lost 2.97 per
cent as 12 of the 14 sub-groups lost ground. The transportation group shed
4.8 per cent, largely due to a decline in Laidlaw 'B' shares of CDollars
5/8 to CDollars 9 1/4 . The company posted a third-quarter loss, against
year-ago net earnings, and sharply lower nine-month net, although the latest
periods included a heavy charge.

SHARES were mixed in moderately active trade as investors remained cautious
ahead of today's settlement of stock index options and the parliamentary
elections on July 18, agencies report from Tokyo.
The Nikkei average lost 32.00 to 19,688.67, after a day's high of 19,764.68
and low of 19,675.77. Volume was estimated at 350m shares, boosted by a
trade of some 140m Nikkatsu shares. Nikkatsu filed for protection from
creditors on July 1 and has since been replaced as a Nikkei index component
stock.
The Topix index of all first section stocks gained 6.55 at 1,590.93 and, in
London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index moved up 2.85 to 1,204.21.
Declining issues just outpaced advances by 457 to 451, with 209 stocks
unchanged.
Non-ferrous metal companies showed gains as the price of gold bullion rose
above Dollars 397 an ounce in the US. Sumitomo Metal Mining added Y20 at
Y1,080, with some 8m shares traded. Mitsui Mining &amp; Smelting put on Y4 at
Y526.
Mitsubishi Petrochemical rose Y17 to Y747 and Mitsui Toatsu Chemicals was

Elsewhere, Nomura Securities eased Y10 to Y1,950, Nikko Securities declined
Y20 to Y1,050 and Daiwa Securities fell Y40 to Y1,220,
Roundup
THE RISE in gold contributed to some of the gains among Pacific Rim markets
yesterday.
AUSTRALIA closed at its highest level since August 1989, but the failure of
the gold price to break the Dollars 400 barrier left the market off the
day's high. The All Ordinaries index, which had opened 13.8 ahead, retreated
in late trading to finish 9.5 up on balance at 1,782.5. Turnover amounted to
ADollars 392.8m.
HONG KONG was slightly lower ahead of the visit of Mr Douglas Hurd, the
British foreign secretary, to Beijing today.
The Hang Seng index ended down 18.72 at 7,122.39 in turnover of HKDollars
2.8bn.
Mr Hurd is due to meet his Chinese counterpart to discuss progress on
negotiations over the future of Hong Kong. The latest round of talks ended
on Tuesday without a breakthrough.
Among the actives, Cheung Kong fell 20 cents to HKDollars 26.80 and HSBC
Holdings lost 50 cents to HKDollars 74.50.
SEOUL gained ground on strong institutional support for large-capitalisation
stocks. The composite index added 7.57 at 760.68 in turnover up to
Won649.7bn from Won398.6bn.
Hyundai Engineering and Construction and Goldstar led the rises in
construction and electronics shares, both gaining Won600 to Won20,100 and
Won17,600 respectively.
TAIWAN relinquished an early gain on profit-taking and the weighted index
ended a net 2.79 easier at 4,017.59. Turnover shrank to TDollars 15.2bn from
TDollars 19.4bn.
Formosa Plastics declined 20 cents to TDollars 42.80 as some investors took
profits after the group's recent announcement that it was to build a new
petrochemical facility.
MANILA continued to improve on positive sentiment for the economy. The
composite index climbed 24.27 to 1,630.77 in turnover of some 460m pesos.
Philippine Long Distance Telephone advanced 25 pesos to 980 pesos and
Philippine National Bank rose 5 pesos to 300 pesos.
NEW ZEALAND recouped most of Wednesday's losses as the NZSE-40 index
finished 4.16 higher at 1,716.49 in turnover of NZDollars 38m.
Among gold stocks, Mineral Resources appreciated 9 cents to NZDollars 1.75.
BOMBAY fell back in a thinly traded session restricted to one hour. The BSE

FT  09 JUL 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Frankfurt threatens 1,800 DAX
level
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LONDON-based strategists at NatWest Securities, Morgan Stanley and Nomura
said nice things yesterday about Germany, or cyclicals, or both, although Mr
James Cornish of NatWest kept a rein on his enthusiasm as he talked about
'puffs of steam from the German locomotive'.
Frankfurt responded, extending Wednesday's advance, and one or two other
continental bourses were inspired by this to a greater or lesser degree,
writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT blasted its way to a second consecutive 1993 high, basically
because of a change of asset allocation policies among Anglo-Saxon
investors, said Mr Jens Wiecking of Merck Finck in Dusseldorf.
The DAX index rose 63.94, or 3.7 per cent on the day to 1,783.70, up 2.5 per
cent from the bullish post-bourse close on Wednesday. The afternoon was
exciting yesterday, too, as the Ibis-based, post-bourse DAX inched closer
and closer to the 1,800 mark, closing at 1,798.69.
Turnover rose from DM8.3bn to DM15.5bn.
Cyclicals were strong with BMW picking up DM37.00 or 7.1 per cent on the
session to DM558.00 on strong US sales and Metallgesellschaft, the metals,
engineering and trading conglomerate, rising DM24.60, or 7 per cent to
DM374.00. Mannesmann put on DM18 to DM293.50 and then another DM7.50 in the
post-bourse for an overall gain of 9.3 per cent, having reported a sizeable
new gas pipe order from Malaysia.
Mr Wiecking said that the market's June rise from 1,600 to 1,700 was
produced on light volume and poor quality of leadership, but that the gains
of the past two days had been on big volume and that Deutsche Bank, Siemens
and Allianz had all shown a good performance.
PARIS was inspired by the news coming out of Germany and, after a quiet
morning session, began to move swiftly forward in late trading. The CAC-40
index closed 36.64 higher at 1,980.37, after a high of 1,989 and a low of
1,939.
Turnover was a brisk FFr4.1bn. Companies with exposure to Germany did well:
Peugeot gained FFr7 to FFr601, Michelin put on FFr7.90 to FFr163 and St
Gobain advanced FFr21 to FFr528.
Euro Disney fell more than 12 per cent after announcing, at the start of the
day a larger than expected third quarter deficit, and forecasting a loss in
the fourth quarter. The shares finished at a new year's low, down FFr8.70 at
FFr59.50: the shares have fallen by nearly 40 per cent since March 30.
Remy Cointreau was FFr5.50 up at FFr180.50 on satisfactory results, and
forecasts of profits growth in the following year.
ZURICH was inspired by Frankfurt, but it did not have that market's strength
in cyclicals; and Swiss banks, unlike their German counterparts, had already
had some heady rises to digest this week.
So the move to cyclicals and industrials left the SMI index a relatively
modest, 24.9 higher at 2,397.9. In banks, UBS, the focus of speculation
earlier this week, rose a mere SFr2 to SFr1,172.
Better gains came in industrials where Brown Boveri rose SFr13 to SFr820,
Ciba Geigy certificates by SFr13 to SFr660, and in Nestle, the most active
stock of the day, as it recovered a little from a Morgan Stanley downgrade
earlier this week, and rose SFr14 to SFr1,103. Zurich Insurance put on SFr19
to SFr1,257.
AMSTERDAM moved higher in line with other markets with some impressive gains
seen in the cyclicals. In chemicals, DSM rose Fl 3.20 to Fl 92.70 and Akzo
by Fl 5.30 to Fl 158.90. The CBS Tendency index improved by 2.2 to 116.
MILAN was encouraged by gains in the insurance and telecommunications
sectors, while hopes of a further easing in interest rates and a stronger
bond market gave broad support to the market.
The Comit index closed up 10.40 or 1.95 per cent at 543.67.
Goldman Sachs, in a recent strategy paper on Italy, forecast a slowdown in
the markets performance over the next quarter, given that the index has
risen 19 per cent since the start of the year in local currency terms.
The insurers have been a market favourite for some time on expectations of a
positive turnaround in the sector. Generali, which closed up L1,180 to
L38,300, has gained 31 per cent since the beginning of the year, while
Fondiaria, up L1,170 to L30,086, has gained 15 per cent over the same
period.
Among telecoms, Stet improved L116 to L3,610, having slipped back over the
last couple of days on technical selling as many investors liquidated
holdings to purchase warrants.
VIENNA was boosted by Frankfurt, short covering and straightforward buying
interest as the ATX index rose 24.53, or 2.9 per cent to 859.02.
Creditanstalt preferred rose Sch35, or 6 per cent to Sch618 and the utility,
Verbund, was up Sch24, or 4.4 per cent to 566.
ISTANBUL retreated a further 4.2 per cent, the composite index losing 474.6
to 10,789.2 in estimated turnover of TL787bn, up from TL597bn.
Mr Ben Hakham of Carnegie forecast a further correction from recent highs,
given the likelihood of higher interest rates in the short-term as the
government seeks to reduce the debt burden, continuing profit taking and
worries over further Kurdish violence.

FT  09 JUL 93 / Money Markets: French rates rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE WAS a sharp upward move in French franc money market interest rates
yesterday after the currency came under strong pressure inside the European
exchange rate mechanism, writes James Blitz.
The French currency has been under pressure for some days amid concern about
the deteriorating economic situation in France and speculation that the
Bundesbank may not reduce short-term interest rates by as much as the Bank
of France would like.
Yesterday the fall in the currency had a pronounced effect on interest rate
markets. Dealers took the view that the French authorities would be unable
to cut interest rates by as much as they would like as long as the currency
threatens to move close to its ERM floor against the D-Mark.
French three-month cash rates rose sharply during the day, from about 7 per
cent in the early European morning to a peak of 7.40 per cent on the bid
side. In the afternoon some of this move was retraced and three-month francs
closed at about 7.18 per cent. But this left them only 10 basis points below
their German counter-parts, a striking indication of how the spread between
money market rates in both countries has narrowed.
Sentiment in French interest rate futures markets was equally downbeat. The
Septem-ber Pibor contract dropped 31 basis points to finish at 93.24. At one
stage the contract was traded at 93.21, bringing it only 7 basis points away
from the equivalent Euromark contract.
Dealers in sterling markets tempered their expectations for a base rate cut
before the end of the year after sterling performed weakly on the foreign
exchanges.
However, the pound retreated about  1/2 pfennig against the German currency
yesterday, forcing a slight retracement in interest rate futures. The
September short sterling contract was down about 4 basis points at one
stage, bottoming out at 94.21. It later climbed back to close at 94.27 as
sterling staged a small recovery.
The cash market reflected the slightly gloomier outlook on interest rates,
with three-month money finishing  1/16 percentage point higher at 5 15/16
per cent. There was a large shortage of Pounds 2bn forecast at the start of
trading, but much of this was removed by the Bank of England using a
repurchase agreement in the early round.

FT  09 JUL 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Franc falls sharply in ERM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE French franc fell sharply against the D-Mark inside the European
exchange rate mechanism yesterday amid increasing concern about the scale of
the economic downturn in France, writes James Blitz.
The franc has been the victim of mild selling pressure for most of this
week. But many dealers were surprised yest-erday by the speed of the fall in
the currency's exchange rate.
After closing in London at FFr3.3832 against the German currency on
Wednesday night, the franc tumbled yesterday morning, almost touching the
FFr3.40 level. It finished in London at FFr3.395.
Against its ERM divergence indicator, the currency was briefly seen at minus
70 percentage points. However, there were no reports of intervention by the
Bank of France.
A gloomy report from INSEE, the French economic information agency, was a
trigger for the worsening sentiment towards the French franc. The group said
that France's total GDP shrank by 0.5 per cent in the first quarter of this
year after a revised fall of 0.3 per cent in the last quarter of 1992. The
group also predicted that French unemployment could be as high as 12.5 per
cent by the end of the year.
Also a strong vehicle for the franc's decline yesterday was the continuing
sell-off of French bonds. Mr Paul Chertkow, chief currency strategist at UBS
in London, said there had been much profit-taking by investors after French
bond yields came close to their German counterparts.
In his view, German short-term interest rates are low enough to encourage
investor interest further along the yield curve.
Mr Chertkow believes that the current pressure on the franc will dissipate
because the Bundesbank will reduce interest rates by 125 basis points this
year and 100 basis points next year. In his view, the French economy's
fundamentally stronger position compared to Germany's will allow the Bank of
France to push its interest rates well below German levels to a point where
they can stimulate recovery.
Mr Mark Austin, treasury economist at Midland Global Markets, is more
pessimistic. 'This was not a one-off,' he said. 'We are at the beginning of
some more pressure in the system.'
The D-Mark was strong against most European currencies, partly helped by
perceptions that the German recession may have bottomed out.
Both the peseta and Italian lira were weaker against the D-Mark on the day.
The German currency pushed sterling down at one stage, but it recovered to
end  1/4 pfennig up on balance at DM2.5500.
The Swedish krona has been particularly hard hit in recent days, following
the news that the country's unemployment rate is at 10 per cent. This is
very high by Swedish standards. The krona closed at around SKr4.65 per
D-Mark yesterday, having been at SKr4.48 earlier in the week.

FT  09 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Guatemalan tobacco growers fear
US import curb
</HEADLINE>

A BILL in the US congress that would restrict domestic cigarette
manufacturers to using a maximum of 25 per cent of imported tobacco, is
threatening to cripple Guatemala's tobacco industry, according to producers
here.
The bill, which is still in committee stage, is part of President Bill
Clinton's Dollars 500bn deficit reduction package, and is expected to be
voted on in the next few weeks.
Guatemala's influential private sector umbrella group, Cacif, has written to
the US congress complaining that the proposal would violate the Generalised
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and goes against the spirit of the Caribbean
Basin Initiative, a unilateral trade benefit granted by the US.
The Central American republic exports mainly Burley tobacco, 70 per cent of
which goes to the US without trade restrictions. Tobacco exports are
expected to reach 15,200 tonnes this year, worth about Dollars 70m. This
follows a sharp increase in planting over 1992, when the Bank of Guatemala
recorded exports of Dollars 28.8m.
For blending purposes US manufacturers require a 15 per cent mix of Turkish
tobacco, which means countries that only produce Burley and Virginia tobacco
will be forced to compete for the remaining 10 per cent of US manufacturing
needs, say exporters here. The US currently imports more than 40 per cent of
its tobacco requirements.
In Guatemala tobacco supports 140,000 people, mostly on the hot, flat lands
along the southern Pacific Coast, according to an industry official.
'If the bill goes through, it will put us out of business,' warned Mr
Francis Carlow, manager of Tabacalera Nacional, a subsidiary of British
American Tobacco, which has been operating in Guatemala since 1928. BAT is
the Central American republic's largest tobacco exporter, accounting for 40
per cent of shipments to the US. Mr Carlow says that US manufacturers will
probably turn to larger, cheaper, lower quality suppliers to rationalise
reduced import requirements.
The Guatemalan government has yet to respond officially to the proposed
measure. But Mrs Irma Luz Toledo Penate, the acting economy minister, said
Guatemala was working on a response together with Honduras, another Central
American producer.
She said the Guatemalan government would consider adopting retaliatory
measures if a negotiated compromise were not found. Apples, chicken, and
textiles have been mooted as possible areas were restrictions might be
imposed.
But a US embassy official in Guatemala City played down the significance of
the Bill. He said the local industry was exaggerating its production figures
and claimed tobacco exporters had told him six weeks ago that they were
expecting a 25 per cent drop in exports during 1993.

FT  09 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Technical factors fuel copper
surge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COPPER'S PRICE burst back to 90 cents a lb on the London Metal Exchange
yesterday, boosted by technical and options-related factors which encouraged
buying by commodity funds.
Defying its poor fundamental situation - the copper market seems likely to
record a substantial supply surplus this year - the metal has bounced back
by nearly Dollars 300 a tonne or 17 per cent since early May to close last
night in London at Dollars 1,997.50.
This followed market turmoil in April when the price collapsed from 98 cents
a lb to a 5 1/2 -year low of 78 cents, a descent so swift that it caused
severe financial losses at several LME trading houses.
At present copper was 'being driven by brilliant technicals', said one
trader yesterday. Options activity pointed to 'potentially an explosive
situation', he added.
Dealers suggested that, in spite of China's attempts to slow its
over-heating economy, Chinese trading houses were still taking 20,000 to
30,000 tonnes of copper a month from LME warehouses in Rotterdam, which
would help to account for the recent fall in the exchange's warehouse stock
levels from 456,125 tonnes reached in late-June - a 15-year peak.
Mr William Adams, analyst at Rudolf Wolff, part of the Noranda natural
resources group, said it was difficult to justify present copper prices. But
producers had for the time being stopped selling forward, perhaps waiting
for the price to go to Dollars 2,000. Sentiment was helped yesterday by news
that Codelco, the state-owned Chilean group, was to buy 60,000 tonnes of
copper cathode during the rest of this year to meet sales commitments.

FT  09 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Sri Lankan tea sector shows
clear signs of recovery - Privatisation has enhanced the estates' efficiency
and increased production
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MERVYN DE SILVA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER LAST year's exceptionally poor performance, Sri Lanka's tea industry
is showing clear signs of recovery.
While annual production in the recent past has regularly exceeded 200m kg,
only 178m kg was produced in 1992, about 62m kg less than in 1991. The first
six months' production this year suggests, however, that total output should
reach 225m kg or slightly more.
A severe drought, the first phase of privatisation and its accompanying
dislocations, disruption of the former Soviet and Iraqi markets and sporadic
labour unrest resulted in a revenue loss of more than USDollars 80m.
Nevertheless, the government and the tea trade expect Sri Lanka to retain
its traditional position as the largest exporter of tea.
The prospects for 1993 are 'quite bright' according to one broker, while the
trade speaks of the government's adoption of a new sales strategy.
One of the most noteworthy achievements of the assassinated President
Premadasa was the step-by-step privatisation of the plantations.
Before independence the tea estates were owned by 'sterling' companies, all
London-based and run by British planters with the help of several hundred
thousand Tamil workers brought from South India, now Tamil Nadu. Thus, the
Kandyan (hill country) Sinhalese peasantry were ousted from their
traditional lands to make way for cheap indentured Indian labour.
The alien presence in the island's heartland soon became an explosive
political issue. Mrs Sirimavo Bandaranaike, the first Sinhalese leader from
the Kandyan hill-country to become prime minister, signed two agreements
with India for the repatriation of 500,000 Indian Tamils. Her Marxist
minister of plantation industries in the United Front party that took office
in 1970 went a step further. He nationalised the tea, rubber and coconut
estates and placed them under two state corporations.
President Premadasa played a different game. The leader of the powerful
trade union controlling estate labour, Mr S Thondaman, became one of Mr
Premadasa's most trusted allies. When the International Monetary Fund and
the World Bank insisted on the re-structuring of the planation corporations,
which were running at a loss, Mr Premadasa could rely on Mr Thondaman to
accede to a compromise formula that the IMF and the bank also reluctantly
accepted, under which the estates were not be returned to their previous
owners but given to 22 management companies.
'The management companies have increased production by better supervision of
estates run down by the two corporations,' says a senior official. 'But the
answer is not increased yields but adjusting to new consumer tastes and
becoming more competitive. The Sri Lanka name is still an advantage but we
have to move rapidly to CTC (cut, tear and curl) teas' he adds.
'We have to sell tea like they sell Coca Cola.'
The Ministry of Plantations and the Tea Board hope to increase production of
CTC teas to 40m kg, or 20 per cent of total production by 1995 and to more
than 100m kg by the year 2000.
According to the tea trade there was overproduction in 1991 and now surplus
stocks with packers and importing countries are exhausted or quite thin. The
need to give higher priority to CTC, says a well-known tea planter, is now
more urgent 'because consumers in two of our major markets, Egypt and
Pakistan are showing an increased preference for CTC'. Another worry is
competition from Georgia, Vietnam and Turkey. The planter suggests Sri Lanka
should establish a few 'instant tea plants' with foreign collaboration, with
the fast-growing US market in mind.
In 1992, Sri Lanka's major buyers were Iran (24m kg, mainly bulk), Jordan
(21.7m kg, mainly packets) Egypt (17m kg, mainly bulk), Syria (14.4m kg,
mainly bulk), Saudi Arabia (11.2m kg, mainly packets) and the UK (10.9m kg,
mainly bulk). The Scandinavian countries, Libya, Japan and Pakistan bought
between 5m and 7m kg each.
The re-appearance of the former Soviet Union as a buyer has heartened the
tea trade. The hard currency payments are made through a series of
intermediaries, including agents in Israel, 'as if the deal was handled by
the KGB', observes Mr Ananda Pieris, a local tea broker.

August Brent CRUDE OIL fell through the contract low at Dollars 16.65 a
barrel on the IPE and in late trading was Dollars 16.52. The last time the
near-month Brent futures contract traded below Dollars 16.65 was when it
reached an intra-day low on February 26 1991 at Dollars 16.50. Traders said
crude oil was pushed over the edge after locals began selling heavily when
August WTI crude futures on Nymex crashed through long term support at
Dollars 17.85 a barrel. The fall came while talks between Iraq and the UN on
conditions that would allow Iraq to sell Dollars 1.6bn of oil over a
six-month period were in session. One New York broker said the market now
suspected Iraq would be allowed to sell oil at a time when Opec was
producing above its ceiling. 'The market looks awful. We have new lows for
two years ..If the headlines come out that Iraq is allowed to sell oil, it
will dump a dollar. It's frightening. It looks so bearish.' GOLD and SILVER
drifted lower in the afternoon on the London bullion market as
disappointment over gold's failure to break through Dollars 400 a troy ounce
in the morning encouraged mild profit-taking. Gold closed at Dollars 395.45,
up Dollars 1.45 on the day.

FT  09 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Caribbean commodity problems
forecast to continue - A report underlining the uncertainties surrounding
the region's economic outlook
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CANUTE JAMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMMODITY exporting countries in the English-speaking Caribbean have been
warned that they will continue to suffer from the problems of weak prices
and uncertain access to markets that affected output last year.
The Caribbean Development Bank, in its report on the region's economic
performance last year, concluded that, although some countries and some
commodities had done better in 1992, there was still cause for concern over
continued preferential markets for sugar and bananas and weak prices for
bauxite and oil.
The Barbados-based bank, which provides loans for 17 members in the region,
has resources of USDollars 847m. Its major contributors are the US, Canada,
the UK, France, and Germany.
Although three sugar producers reported reduced output, overall production
by the CDB's borrowing members grew 8.6 per cent last year to 747,000
tonnes. There was increased production by Trinidad and Tobago, St
Kitts-Nevis and Guyana, with the last improving by 52 per cent.
The bank said Guyana's improvement, which was despite industrial unrest, was
mainly the result of the restructuring of the state-owned industry. Booker
Tate of Britain is managing the industry under contract from the government.
'Guyana, for the first time in five years, was able to meet its domestic
requirements, in addition to fulfilling its international contractual
obligations,' the bank reported. After defaulting on export quota
commitments to the EC and the US Guyana met these in full in 1992.
Sugar production declined last year in Belize, Barbados and Jamaica, and the
bank said this was caused by several factors including poor weather, labour
disputes, and weak export market prices. The bank said the region's industry
was hit last year by a cut in the US quota that saw its members' combined
access falling from 70,702 tonnes the previous year to 63,231 tonnes.
The bank warned its members about the effects of future cuts by the US,
saying: 'More sugar will have to be sold on the world market, at prices
which are substantially below the preferential prices for sales to Europe
and the United States.'
It reported that banana production by its members recovered last year
following a 'disappointing' performance in the previous year. More
favourable weather contributed to the improvement, with exports growing by
18.7 per cent to 381,000 tonnes.
The improvement was more marked in the Windward Islands (St Lucia, St
Vincent, Dominica and Grenada) where exports expanded by 23 per cent. 'In
some countries, performance in value terms was somewhat dampened by weak
prices associated with reported declines in the overall quality of fruit,
and the depreciation of the pound sterling in the fourth quarter of 1992,'
the bank said. The region's currencies are pegged to the US dollar.
The CDB warned, however, that there were still dark clouds over the region's
banana industry because of the possible loss of preferences on the European
Community market. A new EC regime, guaranteeing access of Caribbean bananas,
will be implemented on July 1, but is being challenged by Latin American
producers.
The bank said the possible loss of preferences was a 'serious threat to
regional producers, particularly the Windward Islands where banana exports
account for as much as 60 per cent of export earnings'.
Bauxite production by the bank's members - Jamaica and Guyana - fell 5 per
cent last year to 12.3m tonnes. 'World market prices for aluminium weakened
in response to declining demand associated with the fragile economic
recovery in the industrial countries, increased exports from Europe, changes
in manufacturing technology and the disintegration of the Soviet bloc,' the
report explained.
The reduction was most marked in Guyana where 1992 output fell 30 per cent
below the 1.3m tonnes of the previous year.
Regional crude oil production in 1992 fell 5.6 per cent to 50m barrels, the
bank said. Trinidad and Tobago, the main producer, reported output of 49.5m
barrels, while Barbadian production rose 5.3 per cent to 478,800 barrels.
Grenada, the world's second largest producer of nutmeg, after Indonesia,
recorded an 11.2 per cent decline in production in 1992, to 2,235 tonnes.
'The problem is related to low advance payments to farmers which caused them
not to reap the nutmeg on time in 1992, and the break-up in 1991 of the
Soviet Union, a major market for the product,' the CDB reported.

cent in June
</HEADLINE>

   By Our Commodities Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SURGE of activity in the cocoa market helped to lift June trading volume
at the London Futures and Options Exchange by nearly 40 per cent compared
with the same month last year.
The exchange's 19 contracts traded a total of 337,513 lots during the month,
London Clearing House figures show. That was up from 241,517 lots in the
same contracts in June 1992.
Cocoa market turnover in June amounted to 222,691 lots, up 84 per cent from
the same month last year. Cocoa options volume was up 74.7 per cent at 5,612
lots.
In contrast, turnover in the depressed robusta coffee futures market was
down 13.3 per cent at 60,432 lots, but coffee options turnover was 32.3 per
cent higher at 12,046 lots.
There was a marginal increase in white sugar trading, which totalled 27,250
lots compared with 26,080 lots in June 1992.
Total LCE turnover in the first half of the year was 1.65m, up 12.2 per cent
on January-June 1992.
The exchange reverted to being called the London Commodity Exchange on July
1.

FT  09 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Shephard calls for action on
fish stocks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INTERNATIONAL action is needed to conserve world fish stocks, the House of
Commons Agriculture Committee was told yesterday.
'Unless that common action is taken there will be no fish for anyone to
fish, no jobs for any fishermen and there will be no security for any
fishermen's families,' said Mrs Gillian Shephard, the agriculture minister.
Late on Wednesday night Mr Michael Jack, fisheries minister, announced that
the government was postponing the introduction of limits on the number of
days that could be spent at sea by fishing vessels from October until
January 1 next year. This will allow further time for consultations with the
fishing industry, which has fiercely opposed restrictions on days at sea.
Mr Jack also confirmed that Pounds 25m would be available for a
decommissioning scheme to reduce the size of the British fleet over the next
three years. The closing date for applications has been put back to the end
of this month.
Yesterday Mr Jack told the committee that the ministry had already received
more than 100 applications for decommissioning, which had the potential to
reduce the UK catch by 5 per cent or more.
He also told the committee that there had been much misunderstanding
throughout the industry on the plans to restrict the number of days at sea.
It would not mean that some vessels would get only 80 days at sea, as some
fishermen claimed. 'We have a task to explain our policy better,' he said.
Mrs Shephard said that the government would be spending Pounds 50m a year on
decommissioning, policing and research in the fishing industry when the
total value of the UK catch was Pounds 400m. By any standards, she said,
that had to be regarded as generous.

FT  09 JUL 93 / Government Bonds: French issues slide as franc comes under
pressure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN and KAREN ZAGOR
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRENCH government bonds reacted to heavy currency selling yesterday as a
range of economic data persuaded investors that economic convergence with
Germany had gone far enough.
The data coincided with positive economic German figures and prompted a
rapid movement of money out of France and into Germany.
Economists were engaged in intense debate over whether the move was a
one-off correction or whether it meant the end of the trend for French
government bond yields to move below those in Germany at every point on the
yield curve.
There was certainly a sharp divergence for the yield spread between the two
countries' 10-year bonds, which widened to 21 basis points after being
around 10 basis points for the past few weeks.
Investors focused on a report issued by Insee, the official French
statistics agency, which forecast that national output would fall by 0.7 per
cent this year and that the unemployment rate would rise to 12.5 per cent by
December. These predictions were more pessimistic than earlier government
forecasts which forecast a GDP contraction of 0.4 per cent.
The French franc moved dangerously close to the key FFr3.40 level against
the D-Mark and one analyst argued that it was now profitable for speculators
to sell the franc and buy the D-Mark as short term French rates were lower
than those in Germany.
For France this compares badly with the situation at the end of last year
when there was heavy speculation, but that was countered by the 4 percentage
point differential between French rates and the lower German levels.
It was also pointed out that at a time of deepening recession France was
unlikely to raise rates and so there was less incentive to leave money in
francs.
On the Matif, September 10-year futures fell 0.30 in official trading and a
further 0.20 after the close to hit 119.34.
GERMAN debt prices soared yesterday. There was a feeling that institutions
which responded to comments a few weeks ago by Mr George Soros, the
international speculator, and moved money out of Germany, decided that they
might have gone too short and it was time to correct the weightings.
A revision in the west German consumer price index for June to show a 4.2
per cent year-on-year increase saw German debt prices dip briefly but the
trend was optimistic across the board, and in the futures market the
contract jumped half a point to 95.91.
IN THE UK, gilts confounded many expectations and held firm although they
were sidelined by the franc/D-Mark tussle.
The surprise was heightened because much of the recent buying has come from
German investors and it was thought that they would take the opportunity
yesterday to repatriate funds.
Gilt futures opened slightly lower at 107 1/2 and traded up to 107 by the
close. Underlying gilts were marginally weaker along the curve.
ITALIAN government bonds initially traded higher in the futures market on
the latest vote of confidence for the government but the concentration on
Germany and a weaker lira sent them back to close half a point lower at
103.80. Spain also drifted back, sliding 40 basis points from the start of
trading to 92.90.
US treasury prices drifted lower yesterday morning in dull trading as the
market digested an unexpected decline in weekly jobless claims.
By midday the benchmark 30-year government bond was  7/32 lower at 105 17/32
, yielding 6.690 per cent. At the short end of the market, the two-year note
was off  1/32 , to yield 4.008 per cent.
The market was depressed by a report that jobless claims fell 12,000 in the
week ended July 3. Most economists had expected claims to rise 5,000 in the
week. Sentiment was dampened further by a string of strong sales
improvements for a number of large US stores.
In the absence of significant economic news, market participants are waiting
to see whether next week's release of June's producer price index and
consumer price index will provide fresh signs of inflation.

FT  09 JUL 93 / International Capital Markets: Taiwan opens way for foreign
securities firms
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE Taiwan Securities and Exchange Commission is to relax entry conditions
for foreign-based securities firms.
The move is aimed at attracting more foreign dealers to further
internationalise and enliven Taiwan's stock market. This has a total share
value of more than Dollars 110bn with over 260 companies listed.
Under the new rules, foreign securities investment firms will need NTDollars
170m (Dollars 6.4m) to set up brokerages and engage in purchases on margins
and short sales. The similar requirement for a local company is NTDollars
200m.
Foreign dealers can begin operations with only NTDollars 80m, again compared
with the NTDollars 200m capitalisation requirement for a prospective local
dealer. A foreign-based underwriter requires NTDollars 90m, according to the
new rules.
The SEC said that any foreign company with representative offices in Taiwan
for more than two years can apply to set up a branch.
Mr K. C. Chen, vice-president of Jardine Fleming Taiwan Investment
Management, said the lowering of the capitalisation requirement for new
dealerships 'is the most attractive portion of the new rules'.
He added that leading foreign brokerage firms, with higher commissions than
local firms, had found it difficult to compete with local counterparts.
But Mr Chen said Jardine Fleming and other foreign underwriters were more
competitive in underwriting because of their greater experience and
technical expertise.

FT  09 JUL 93 / International Capital Markets: Austria launches new bond
contract
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AUSTRIA will launch its first bond futures contract today, thus joining the
growing number of national exchanges to increase liquidity with a debt
derivatives market.
Vienna's OTOB futures exchange will begin trading contracts based on a
basket of eight to 10-year maturities which reflects the method used by most
of the big bond futures markets, including Germany.
Since the futures exchange began dealing index futures, stock options and
index options nearly two years ago it had achieved turnover two to three
times greater than the cash market, according to Mr Christian Imo, OTOB
chief executive.
'The underlying bond market is four or five times the value of the stock
market so we expect huge volume from the bond futures contract.'
The first three contracts will have expiry dates in September, December and
March of next year and be based on a notional bond with a 10-year maturity
and a 7 per cent coupon. They will be traded by seven marketmakers - six
domestic banks and Deutsche Bank (Austria). Five other banks will act as
agent and principals.
Mr Wolfgang Lichtl, head trader at Credit Anstalt, one of the accredited
marketmaker banks, said there was general enthusiasm for the contract but
reservations over the cost. 'My own opinion is that if it was cheaper, that
might help liquidity.'
The launch news helped a bond market already boosted by a surge in German
debt prices. Buying pressure from overseas and position-building by domestic
marketmakers ahead of the start of futures trading today sent the most
recent 10-year 6.875 per cent Austrian government bond 0.35 higher to
100.50.
Chase Manhattan Investment Services, part of the Chase Manhattan Bank group,
has opened a retail investment office in New York City, Reuter reports from
New York.
According to Chase, it is the only commercial bank offering this service.

FT  09 JUL 93 / International Bonds: Province of Ontario back with CDollars
1.25bn issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Province of Ontario returned to the international capital market with
yet another large global bond offering yesterday, heading a list of new
issues in the Canadian dollar sector.
Ontario, which has an AA2/AA credit rating, is a frequent borrower, and
normally prefers to launch global US dollar or Canadian dollar deals.
Yesterday's much-heralded CDollars 1.25bn, 10-year global bond issue was
well-received, attracting interest from mainly institutional investors.
The bonds were re-offered at 98.125 giving a yield of 8.02 per cent. Merrill
Lynch, the global co-ordinator, said the yield spread over the Canadian
government bond narrowed from 70 to 69 basis points.
Last month, Ontario launched a USDollars 2bn, seven-year global bond
offering, and is over halfway through its 1993-94 borrowing requirement of
CDollars 10bn.
Two other borrowers took advantage of the investor demand to launch Canadian
dollar deals yesterday. The Province of Quebec's water purification agency -
Quebec Water - joined the torrent of issuers to raise CDollars 125m in
10-year bonds.
The deal was priced to yield 80 basis points over the government bond,
giving an annual yield of 8.29 per cent. The lead manager said the deal is
orientated towards retail investors.
Meanwhile, the Kingdom of Denmark launched a CDollars 200m, four-year deal
which was thought to have been swapped given that there are reasonable swap
opportunities at the shorter end of the curve.
The Eurosterling sector of the market continued to see plenty of activity,
as dealers pointed out that domestic and overseas investors are eager to
snap up sterling paper.
Ladbroke Group, the gaming and property group, launched a Pounds 125m,
10-year issue. The proceeds will be used to repay short-term bank debt,
extending the group's debt maturity profile as a result.
Ladbroke does not have a credit rating, but BZW, the lead manager, said it
looked at a recent Eurosterling issue from Forte as a guide to the price.
Forte, which is BAA1/A-, has bonds trading at a spread of 129-130 over the
gilt. Ladbroke's bonds were priced to yield 127 basis points over the gilt,
narrowing to 125 basis points over.
National Bank of Hungary made its debut in the Eurosterling market with a
Pounds 100m, 10-year issue.
The bonds have a 10 per cent coupon and were priced to yield 260 basis
points over the 8 per cent gilt due 2003, giving an overall yield of 10.13
per cent at the re-offer price.

<TEXT>
VOLKSWAGEN, the German carmaker, said it would not for now build a
pioneering factory in Spain's Basque Country, the pet project of its
Basque-born purchasing director, Mr Jose Lopez de Arriortua, Reuter reports
from Berlin.
'If you look at the overall economic situation, there can be no question of
it at this time,' VW's chief executive Mr Ferdinand Piech told the German
daily Die Welt.
'I have told Mr Lopez this. Contrary to other reports, this is a definitive
decision.'
However, VW confirmed it was negotiating, through its Spanish unit SEAT,
with a group of Spanish investors over setting up the greenfield plant in Mr
Lopez's birthplace of Amorebieta.
The group was made up of Banco Bilbao Vizcaya, Banco Central Hispano, the
Bilbao Bizkaia Kutxa savings bank, the Iberdrola energy group, and the
Mondragon co-operative.
Mr Piech was also quoted as saying the group expected to make a profit in
the third quarter of this year, and to break even for the year as a whole.
In the first quarter of this year, VW made a loss of DM1.25bn (Dollars
730m).
Die Welt quoted Mr Piech saying: 'Taking the year as a whole we will record
a black zero. By that I mean that 1993 will be loss-free for Volkswagen. The
first stage of our target has been reached.'

prices hit Remy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
REMY-COINTREAU yesterday highlighted the problems of the French drinks
industry by announcing a 25 per cent fall in net profits, to FFr202m
(Dollars 35.43m), in the year to March 31, from FFr271m in the previous
year.
The group, which owns a string of famous French drink brands, ranging from
Remy-Martin cognac to Cointreau liqueur, attributed the fall in profits to
the difficulties of the champagne market, where many producers have been
badly affected by the combination of weak demand and high grape prices.
The squeeze on champagne margins was the chief cause of a reduction in
operating profits, from FFr1.05bn to FFr876m. The Cointreau brand was
affected in the first half by a change in its distribution arrangements.
However, Remy managed to maintain margins in cognac, which was buoyed by
strong growth in the fledgling Chinese market, and to improve them in
liqueurs and spirits.
Turnover fell from FFr6.47bn to FFr5.83bn in the year to March 31, but Remy
benefited from a reduction in financial costs, from FFr605m to FFr577m, over
the same period.
The news of Remy's fall in profits comes at a sensitive time for the French
drinks industry, particularly for the champagne sector.

FT  09 JUL 93 / International Company News: Cummins Engine and Telco link in
Indian venture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CUMMINS ENGINE of the US and India's Tata Engineering and Locomotive (Telco)
yesterday announced an important Dollars 50m joint venture to produce
engines for Telco vehicles at a proposed new plant at Jamshedpur.
The deal is one of the biggest joint ventures agreed in India in the past
two years, since it began to promote inward foreign investment as part of an
economic liberalisation programme.
The equally-owned venture will bring together the world's largest
independent producer of diesel engines and India's dominant manufacturer of
trucks and buses.
It is expected initially to produce about 60,000 Cummins B Series engines a
year when operations begin in mid-1995. They will power Telco vehicles for
the Indian market and for export.
For Cummins, the deal is another important plank in its Asian strategy, and
comes five months after it announced a co-operation deal in diesel engines
with Komatsu of Japan. The US company has been producing large diesel
engines in India for about 30 years through its Kirloskar-Cummins joint
venture.
However, Mr Henry Schacht, Cummins' chairman and chief executive, said
yesterday: 'We were missing from the volume part of the market in India  -
the eight, six and four-litre engines.'
The engines produced from the new plant, about 150 miles west of Calcutta,
will replace an important Telco range. This will allow the Indian company to
move to a new generation of efficient, low-emission engines in partnership
with an established producer which has already invested heavily in the
latest diesel and emissions technology.
Mr Schacht said the joint venture should be profitable in its second full
year of operation. The new plant would be able to handle growth beyond
Telco's current needs, and also supply engines for off-highway markets
through Kirloskar-Cummins.
Telco, the world's sixth largest manufacturer of medium and heavy commercial
vehicles, is the largest of the Tata group of companies. Last month it
reported a 75 per cent fall in net profit, to Rs300m (Dollars 9.6m) for the
year ended March.
The joint venture is an important part of Telco's modernisation and
expansion plans, and follows the opening in the past year of a new truck
assembly plant at Lucknow in north India.
The venture has yet to be approved by the Indian government.
The Indian government has approved the establishment of Seagram (India). The
new company will have a capital investment in excess of Rs250m. It will
produce distilled spirits, and develop fruit juice and fruit processing
capacity.

FT  09 JUL 93 / International Company News: Investment banks rush down
Mexico way - State sell-offs and corporate shake-ups are proving
irresistible
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
US and European investment banks are flocking to Mexico, drawn by
privatisations and the wholesale restructuring of Mexican businesses brought
about by free trade pressures.
From almost nothing five years ago, corporate finance activity in Mexico was
worth almost Dollars 17bn last year, making Mexico by far the biggest market
in Latin America.
Virtually every important international investment bank - led by J. P.
Morgan, Citibank and Goldman Sachs in the US, and in the UK by N. M.
Rothschild and S. G. Warburg - has teams of bankers devoted to Mexico,
either working out of representative offices, or from near-permanent suites
in five-star hotels.
Mexico prohibits international investment banks (apart from Citicorp) from
setting up subsidiaries in Mexico - although this will change when and if
the proposed North American Free Trade Agreement is approved by US Congress.
Until now the most lucrative business has been privatisation. Goldman Sachs
advised on the Dollars 5.4bn privatisation of Mexico's telephone company,
Telefonos de Mexico; CS First Boston on the Dollars 12.4bn privatisation of
the 18 banks; and S. G. Warburg on the steel mills sell-off. Scores of other
banks, such as Baring Securities, muscled in on the deals as co-managers of
equity issues.
While the official privatisation programme is being wound up, the banks have
been turning to private financing of Mexico's public infrastructure,
offering the government advice on attracting private investment to
electricity, roads, water, and other former state responsibilities. Such
investment is likely to run into tens of billions of dollars over the next
decade.
N. M. Rothschild and partners have just opened a Mexican incorporated
financial boutique to take advantage of such project finance opportunities,
in which it has long experience in Europe and South America.
'We will now be able to expand on-shore activities significantly, which we
were reluctant to do from the base of a representative office,' says Mr
Charles Alexander, head of Latin America for the bank.
Rapid changes in Mexican corporate strategy are fuelling demand for mergers
and acquisitions work. Mexican companies, open to free trade for six years,
are having to increase productivity to compete with foreign rivals.
'What happened in Europe after 1986 is happening in Mexico. Companies
realise that with cross-border competition they needed to concentrate on
what they do best, look for partners, and sell off peripheral businesses,'
says Justin Manson, of Morgan Stanley.
Undisputed leader in cross-border mergers and acquisitions is JP Morgan. It
advised PepsiCo in its Dollars 320m acquisition of 80 per cent of the
biscuit company Gamesa, Cemex on its Dollars 1.8bn purchase of the Spanish
companies Sanson and Valenciana, and investors from Femsa on its Dollars
2.55bn purchase of 51 per cent of Bancomer. Unlike other banks, JP Morgan
stayed in Mexico through the lean 1980s, building a presence.
Such M&amp;A work has expanded significantly as Mexican companies look for
partners, and as foreigners search for easy ways to enter the potentially
lucrative Mexican consumer market. In the past 14 months, Cadbury Schweppes
has bought the water arm of Femsa; Anheuser-Busch 18 per cent of Modelo, the
brewer, for Dollars 477m; and Coca-Cola 30 per cent of the soft drinks
division of Femsa for Dollars 195m.
These acquisitions have been concentrated in distribution-intensive consumer
product industries, where barriers to entry for foreign companies are hard
to surmount. However, JP Morgan and other banks believe approval of the
North American Free Trade Agreement will draw US firms looking to secure
joint ventures in the manufacturing sector, and take advantage of cheap
Mexican labour to export back to the US.
While such joint ventures are expected to hold the greatest potential, last
year there were more Mexican acquisitions of foreign companies than of
Mexican companies by foreign concerns. The Cemex purchase of the Spanish
cement companies and others pushed the value of such transactions to Dollars
2.8bn in 1992.
These purchases reflect growing internationalisation of Mexican business, as
free trade encourages large companies, such as Televisa, Cemex and Vitro, to
compete globally. 'Some Mexican companies have essentially out-grown their
market,' says Mr Richard Duron, head of Latin American M&amp;A for JP Morgan.
'You could expect many more of these deals.'
Growing international competition has sustained the boom in Mexican
international equity and debt offerings, as companies have sought to raise
cheap dollar debt to upgrade plants and compete with international rivals.
Last year, Mexico raised Dollars 7.2bn in debt and equity markets, according
to Morgan Stanley, against Dollars 6.7bn in 1991, and a mere Dollars 252m in
1988.
Mr Paul Zuckerman, head of Latin America for SG Warburg, says: 'Big
companies have become subject to international competition. If they want to
operate internationally they have to fund themselves on a competitive
basis.'

<TEXT>
AMCOR, the Australian paper and packaging company, has agreed to print a
notice in its next annual report disclosing an accounting dispute with the
Australian Securities Commission, Reuter reports from Melbourne.
The Securities Commission is disputing the treatment of a ADollars 50.5m
(USDollars 34.1m) expense charged by Amcor against retained profits in the
year ended June, 1992.
The regulator said the expense, relating to the re-planting of forests by
the company, should have been charged against operating profit. Such a
charge would have reduced Amcor's after-tax profit to ADollars 216m from
ADollars 266.5m, the figure reported.
Amcor has agreed to print a note in its annual report outlining this dispute
with the commission. The regulator said it would not be taking any further
action against Amcor.

FT  09 JUL 93 / International Company News: Australian TV network unveils
float prospectus

<TEXT>
DIRECTORS of Seven Network, the Australian television operator sent into
receivership in 1989, yesterday released details of a fully-underwritten
public flotation to raise ADollars 611m (USDollars 427.3m).
The company will issue just over 300m shares, at ADollars 2 each, and raise
another ADollars 125m in debt. Proceeds will be applied to repayment of just
over ADollars 700m worth of loans owed to a banking syndicate which
restructured the company in 1991.
The Seven Network prospectus confirmed that Mr Rupert Murdoch's News
Corporation, the Australian media group, and Telecom, the Australian phone
company, would subscribe for 15 and 10 per cent respectively of the
company's shares.
Seven indicated yesterday that the company's earnings before interest and
tax had fallen markedly for the year ended June, 1993, reflecting high costs
associated with televising the Barcelona Olympic games.
The prospectus shows earnings before interest and tax falling from ADollars
70.9m to ADollars 56.1m for last year, but forecasts a recovery to ADollars
85.4m in the current year. That compares with just ADollars 10.6m in 1990.
Analysts suggested yesterday that the Seven flotation could benefit from
unsatisfied demand for the share issue by Woolworths, the Australian
retailer. Woolworths subscriptions, due to close today, are believed to be
running at more than twice the ADollars 2.45bn sought.

DOW JONES &amp; CO, the publishing group which owns the Wall Street Journal,
yesterday reported a 5.3 per cent drop in second-quarter net income, which
it said was due mainly to a decline in advertising lineage at the Journal.
The company reported net income of Dollars 39.81m, or 40 cents a share,
compared with Dollars 42.02m, or 41 cents a share, in the same period of
last year. Revenues rose 4.2 per cent to Dollars 487m.
For the first half, the company reported net income of Dollars 70.75m, or 71
cents a share, up from Dollars 58.17m, or 57 cents a share, on revenues
which rose 5.2 per cent from Dollars 904m to Dollars 950m. First-half
earnings rose 2.6 per cent when a 1992 charge for changes in income tax and
post-retirement benefits is excluded.
Mr Peter Kann, chairman, said second-quarter advertising lineage had been
soft, largely because of general economic uncertainty. 'Businesses are still
cautious about a recovery and that affects their spending.'
Operating income for the quarter at the group's information services
segment, which includes the Dow Jones/Telerate and Business Information
Services groups, totalled Dollars 39.1m, up 4.4 per cent, on revenue 8.6 per
cent ahead at Dollars 214m.
The business publications segment saw a 12.3 per cent slide in operating
income, to Dollars 37.9m, with revenue little changed at Dollars 210m. The
Wall Street Journal's advertising lineage was down 7.3 per cent.
Ottaway Newspapers, a community newspapers subsidiary, saw an 11 per cent
dip in operating income, to Dollars 9.1m, while revenues rose 4.6 per cent
to Dollars 63.1m. Advertising lineage rose 1 per cent.
Chevron, the US oil group, is to sell its 71-year-old headquarters building
at 225 Bush Street in San Francisco's financial district as part of its
corporate restructuring, agencies report from San Francisco.

FT  09 JUL 93 / International Company News: Laidlaw takes Dollars 120.5m
charge in third quarter
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE deteriorating economics of US landfill operations have led Laidlaw, the
Ontario-based waste services and transport operator, to take a special
USDollars 120.5m charge against third-quarter earnings.
The write-down pushed Laidlaw to a Dollars 33.6m loss, equal to 12 cents a
share, in the three months to May 31, compared with earnings of Dollars
38.8m, or 14 cents, after extraordinary items a year earlier.
Revenues climbed to Dollars 543.8m from Dollars 517.4m.
Equity earnings from Laidlaw's 28 per cent interest in ADT, the
international security and vehicle auctions group, and from its 35 per cent
stake in Attwoods, the UK-based waste management company, edged up to
Dollars 8.8m.
A Laidlaw official said yesterday that the write-down followed a year-long
review of US markets.
The company has decided not to develop five sites bought earlier for
landfill operations, nor to expand three other existing landfills.
Rubbish volumes in North America have declined markedly in recent years,
partly as a result of the recession, but also reflecting moves towards
recycling and re-using waste.
At the same time, margins have been squeezed by intensifying competition.
Laidlaw's solid-waste margins narrowed to 8.4 per cent in the third quarter
from 10.3 per cent a year earlier.
Hazardous-waste margins slid to 9.8 per cent from 15.3 per cent.
Laidlaw's expansion in waste-services has recently focused on Europe,
especially Italy. It is also investigating opportunities in Mexico.
The company recently diversified its passenger-transport business by
acquiring San Diego-based Medtrans, one of North America's biggest ambulance
and medical transport operators.
The medical transport business is expected to offer acquisition
opportunities similar to those which spurred the growth of its school-bus
operations in the 1980s.
Total industry revenues are estimated at Dollars 4bn a year, but the
business is fragmented among about 4,800 operators.
Laidlaw is 47 per cent owned by Canadian Pacific. Its share price fell by 63
cents to CDollars 9.25 on the Toronto stock exchange yesterday.

YASUDA Fire and Marine Insurance, the Japanese non-life company, is to take
a 10 per cent stake in INA Life Insurance, a Japanese arm of the Cigna group
of the US, in preparation for planned reforms of Japan's life market.
The Japanese government is planning to dismantle the barriers between
non-life companies and life assurers after 1995, and Yasuda said the stake
in the Japanese arm of a US company would allow it to gain experience in the
life market in advance of the changes.
Under Japanese law, Yasuda can take no more than the 10 per cent stake, for
which it paid an undisclosed sum. Japanese reports suggested that the
company invested Y5bn (Dollars 46.4m), but Yasuda would not confirm that
figure.
INA, established in Japan in 1981, had assets of Y136.3bn at the end of
March and collected Y71.4bn in premiums last financial year. Yasuda will
send trainees to INA to gain experience in the life business, while INA
products will be sold through Yasuda offices.

<TEXT>
MARRIOTT Corporation, the large US lodging and food services group,
yesterday posted underlying second-quarter net earnings of Dollars 36m, or
29 cents a share, excluding the impact of accounting changes.
A year earlier, Marriott earned Dollars 29m, or 24 cents.
Sales in the latest quarter were Dollars 2.16bn, compared with Dollars
2.04bn in the same period of 1992.
Last month, the company said that it would take a charge against
second-quarter earnings of Dollars 32m, or 29 cents, to reflect more
accurately the net realisable value of assets being held for sale.
Including this charge, Marriott earned Dollars 4m in the 1993 quarter.
For the six months to June 187, Marriott earned Dollars 55m, or 44 cents, on
sales of Dollars 4.24bn, excluding the one-time charge. This compares with
earnings of Dollars 40m, or 31 cents on sales of Dollars 3.99bn.
The results were in line with expectations, and shares in Marriott eased
Dollars  3/8 to close at Dollars 25 7/8 in New York.
Doubletree Hotels Corporation, a Phoenix, Arizona-based hotel chain, and
Boston-based Guest Quarter Hotels Partnership yesterday signed a letter of
intent to merge.
Guest Quarters Hotels Partnership is owned by General Electric Investments
in partnership with Richard Ferris and Peter Ueberroth.
Doubletree is owned by Canadian Pacific Hotels &amp; Resorts and Metropolitan

GREAT Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Company, the US supermarket operator in which

per cent drop in first-quarter earnings before special charges, writes
Martin Dickson.
The company, which has come under fire from the New York state employees'
pension fund for a lacklustre profits record, reported earnings of Dollars
17.05m, or 45 cents a share, compared with Dollars 22.8m, or 60 cents a

The 1992 figures were turned into a Dollars 157.4m loss by Dollars 180.2m of
unusual non-cash charges.
Sales in the quarter totalled Dollars 3.28bn, compared with Dollars 3.3bn,
and the 1993 figures were helped by more than 11 weeks of sales from more
than 40 Big Star stores, acquired in March.

FIDELITY, the US investment fund company, has become the largest private
investor in YPF, Argentina's recently-privatised oil company. The Economy
Ministry confirmed yesterday that Fidelity paid Dollars 95m for its 1.4 per
cent stake, writes John Barham in Buenos Aires.
Last month the government raised Dollars 3.04bn from the sale of 45.3 per
cent of YPF. A further 12.7 per cent has been reserved for pensioners in
Argentina.
The federal and local governments and employees hold the remaining 42 per
cent of the shares.
Perez Companc, Argentina's third-largest company, and FIMA, a local unit
trust fund, are the only Argentine groups with significant holdings in YPF,
with 1.3 per cent and 0.2 per cent respectively.
Investment funds, including SG Warburg, Mercury Asset Management and
Schroders of the UK and Capital Research and Management, Oppenheimer, and
Alliance Capital of the US, make up the bulk of YPF's new private investors.

NOVELL, the software developer, is to add full-motion video capabilities to
its widely-used Netware network operating system, which manages and controls
networks of personal computers.
Novell aims to make multi-media capabilities, currently limited to
stand-alone desktop computers, available on PC networks.
Applications may include video conferencing and 'live' broadcast of, for
example, business presentations and training or education sessions.
Networked multimedia would also provide real-time updates of stored video
files, overcoming the limitations of desktop CD-Rom systems that can only be
updated with new CDs. Novell will make network services for multimedia
available in phases beginning in 1994.
The company also announced it had bought Fluent, a small software developer
specialising in multimedia, for Dollars 17.5m. Novell will integrate
Fluent's applications into Netware. It said the purchase would probably
result in a one-time write-off of assets of up to Dollars 15m during
Novell's third quarter.

<TEXT>
JUNE was a mixed month for US retailers, with performances ranging from a
strong improvement in same-store sales for Sears to a decline in comparable
store sales for Woolworth, which also warned that it would post
disappointing second-quarter earnings.
In the previous month the big retailers generally experienced modest sales
gains.
Woolworth, which has reported weak figures recently, posted a 0.5 per cent
decline in domestic comparable store sales for the five weeks to July 3.
It predicted that second-quarter earnings would fall significantly below the
previous year's results.
'Consumer spending continues to be under pressure in our principal markets
and sales are continuing to run well below plan,' said Mr William Lavin,
chairman and chief executive. 'Consequently, we are anticipating that
earnings for the second quarter will fall well below last year's second
quarter,' he added.
Sears, Roebuck, the Chicago-based retailer, fared significantly better, with
same-store sales up 12 per cent in the month in its core domestic stores
division.
'A majority of our businesses reported double-digit percentage sales
increases,' said Mr Arthur Martinez, chairman of the merchandise division.
Kmart, the discount and specialty store group, said June sales had
'strengthened considerably'.
The Troy, Michigan-based group attributed the improvement to warmer weather
in important markets and the start of Kmart's clearance programme for spring
and summer merchandise.
Kmart's same-store sales rose by 2.8 per cent in June, including a 4.8 per
cent gain on the general merchandise side.
Wal-Mart Stores, the nation's top-selling retailer, turned in a 7 per cent
rise in same-store sales for June. Comparable store sales were up 5 per cent
for the five months to June 30. Its Sam's warehouse clubs posted a 1 per
cent rise in same-store sales, compared with a 2 per cent decline in the
first five months of the financial year.
In the department store sector, JC Penney saw comparable store sales
increase 4.5 per cent in the June period. At May Department Stores,
store-for-store sales were 5.7 per cent higher, with a 6.2 per cent rise in
its department stores.
At Federated, comparable-store sales were 6.6 per cent higher, but the
company warned that it expected slimmer sales increases in the second half,
compared with a strong second half in 1992.
'We have planned on that basis, however, and we continue to view the
remainder of this year with what we think is an appropriate degree of
caution,' said Mr Allen Questrom, chairman and chief executive.

GREAT Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Company, the US supermarket operator in which
Germany's Tengelmann group holds a majority stake, yesterday reported a 25
per cent drop in first-quarter earnings before special charges.
The company, which has come under fire from the New York state employees'
pension fund for a lacklustre profits record, reported earnings of Dollars
17.05m, or 45 cents a share, compared with Dollars 22.8m, or 60 cents a

The 1992 figures were turned into a Dollars 157.4m loss by Dollars 180.2m of
unusual non-cash charges.
Sales in the quarter totalled Dollars 3.28bn, compared with Dollars 3.3bn,
and the 1993 figures were helped by over 11 weeks of sales from over 40 Big
Star stores acquired in late March.
The gross margin rate rose to 28.7 per cent from 28.55 a year earlier.
Same-store sales in the quarter dropped 0.8 per cent, but the company
pointed out that this was an improvement from the 3.1 per cent drop in the
fourth quarter.
Mr James Wood, chairman, said same-store sales showed an improving trend in
a very gradually improving economic climate.
Chevron, the US oil group, is to sell its 71-year-old headquarters building
at 225 Bush Street in San Francisco's financial district as part of its
corporate restructuring, agencies report from San Francisco.
The group has about 2,000 employees in San Francisco.

FT  09 JUL 93 / International Company News: Canadian combination creates new
CDollars 20bn unit

<TEXT>
CANADA'S financial services deregulation, coupled with the long recession
and rising competition, have forced the big Desjardins credit union movement
to consolidate with the publicly-held Laurentian Group.
The newly-formed group will have corporate assets of around CDollars 20bn
(USDollars 15.6bn) and a further CDollars 50bn under administration through
its subsidiaries.
It will rank as Canada's fifth or sixth biggest financial services
conglomerate, including units in banking, trust services, life insurance and
mortgages.
Laurentian had been seeking a strategic partner for more than a year, partly
to inject new capital into its life and general insurance unit. Desjardins
operates 1,500 banking units, mainly in Quebec, while Laurentian Bank
operates in both Quebec and Ontario.
Desjardins will have majority control of the new Desjardins Laurentian
Financial Corp, taking in the financial services units of both groups.
However, Laurentian General, a property and casualty insurer, is excepted
from the deal.
Laurentian Group's 50 per cent holding in this unit is being sold to its
partner, La Victoire of France, for an undisclosed sum. The French company
paid about CDollars 50m for its 50 per cent share in 1990.
Both Mr Claude Beland, head of Desjardins, and Mr Jacques Droin, chairman of
Laurentian, said the consolidation had been dictated by heightened
competition resulting from globalisation of financial markets.
The two main life insurance subsidiaries of Desjardins and Laurentian will
be merged, although this arrangement excludes Imperial Life in Toronto.
Laurentian Group minority shareholders will receive a combination of cash
and common shares of Desjardins Laurentian Financial.

FIDELITY, the leading US investment fund company, has become the largest
private investor in YPF, Argentina's recently-privatised oil company. The
Economy Ministry confirmed yesterday that Fidelity paid Dollars 95m for its
1.4 per cent stake in YPF.
According to data leaked to the local press yesterday, 20 of YPF's largest
private investors now hold 16 per cent of its equity.
Last month the government raised Dollars 3.04bn from the sale of 45.3 per
cent of YPF. A further 12.7 per cent has been reserved for pensioners in
Argentina. The federal and local governments and employees hold the
remaining 42 per cent of the company's shares.
Perez Companc, Argentina's third-largest company, and FIMA, a local unit
trust fund, are the only Argentine groups with significant holdings in YPF,
with 1.3 per cent and 0.2 per cent respectively.
Investment funds, including SG Warburg, Mercury Asset Management and
Schroders of the UK and Capital Research and Management, Oppenheimer, and
Alliance Capital of the US, make up the bulk of YPF's new private investors.
Two foreign debt-driven investment funds run by foreign banks also took
large stakes.
Citicorp, acting through an investment company funded with Argentine foreign
debt, and the APDT debt-for-equity fund took 1.5 per cent and 1.2 per cent
respectively.

FT  09 JUL 93 / International Company News: Goldsmith confounds sceptics
with sale of Newmont shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANY analysts were sceptical when Sir James Goldsmith, the international
financier, said three years ago that he would find a way to sell most of his
49 per cent stake in Newmont Mining, North America's biggest gold producer,
without damaging the share price. But he appears to have achieved that
objective.
The 9.65m Newmont shares he and his colleague Lord Rothschild are to sell
via public offering are to be priced at Dollars 54.75 each. Analysts suggest
the price is about right given the state of the gold market.
Newmont shares were priced at just over Dollars 52 last week when the
financiers announced their intention to make a secondary offering -
representing 12.5 per cent of Newmont.
Sir James and Lord Rothschild paid Dollars 1.1bn, or Dollars 39 a share, for
their holdings in October 1990. After the offering, Sir James's stake will
have been reduced to 4.9 per cent. Lord Rothschild's holding will be 1.5 per
cent. They have taken advantage of the fire they helped ignite in the market
in April by selling, at Dollars 39.50 a share, 10 per cent of Newmont to US
funds managed by Mr George Soros. A further 9.5 per cent was sold to a
banking consortium in May. These were sold on at Dollars 45.50 each.
The latest sale, by public offering scheduled for delivery on July 14, will
raise Dollars 528m.
'This is a fairly full price, but not an outrageous price,' said Mr John
Phizackerley, analyst at Lehman Brothers. 'Sir James has kept his word that
he would exit Newmont without damaging the price for everybody else. Whether
Mr Soros exits so gracefully is another matter.'

FT  09 JUL 93 / International Company News: Robeco assets rise 20% to Fl
56bn

<TEXT>
ROBECO Group, the big Dutch-based fund manager, said its assets under
management rose by a strong 20 per cent to Fl 55.7bn (Dollars 29.3bn) in the
first half of 1993, helped by large gains on investments as well as a
substantial inflow of new funds.
Robeco, the group's flagship equity fund achieved a 15.6 per cent return on
investment, including dividend reinvestment.
The strongest performance was turned in by Robeco's regional investment
vehicle, RG Pacific Fund, which produced a result of 27.6 per cent. Its
Europe fund saw an 11.9 per cent advance, while its America fund saw a rise
of 8 per cent.
Overall, eight of the group's 12 bourse-listed investment funds achieved
half-year results of more than 10 per cent.
Rotterdam-based Robeco said that although first-half investment results had
exceeded historical full-year averages, it expects a further increase in
results for the rest of 1993. This development will be spurred by additional
decreases in short-term interest rates in Europe, bolstering stock and bond
prices and prompting investors to move out of deposits into other investment
vehicles.
It attributed the first-half results to the buoyancy of world financial
markets caused by lower interest rates, as well as to favourable currency
movements.
In the first-half, Robeco's client base rose by 50,000 to 530,000.

FT  09 JUL 93 / International Company News: Nokia shrugs off the turmoil of
the 1980s / A look at the strategy that has taken the Finnish group back to
the black
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN Mr Jorma Ollila and his band of young Nokia executives took two
aeroplane-loads of guests this week to eastern Finland for a trip by lake
steamer to the opera, they could afford to shrug off the cold damp weather
that chilled the setting of Olavinlinna Castle.
With Nokia riding back into the black on the back of rising demand for its
telephone systems and mobile phones, and a near FM1bn (Dollars 185.2m)
international share issue comfortably in the bag, the chief executive and
his team could enjoy a stirring performance of Verdi's Macbeth warmed by the
knowledge that Finland's highest profile company is looking in better shape
than for some considerable time.
The same day, Nokia had announced it was buying out Tandy Corporation's
share of two joint venture producers that Nokia and Tandy had founded in
South Korea and the US in a move by the Helsinki-based group to consolidate
its position as the largest cellular mobile phone supplier in Europe. Its 20
per cent world market share is second only to Motorola of the US which has
30 per cent.
The message from Mr Ollila was that Nokia is moving smartly ahead in its aim
to concentrate on telecommunications - particularly in mobile telephone
systems and equipment - where markets are expanding in spite of a faltering
economic outlook, especially in Europe. Pre-tax profits for 1993 are seen by
analysts as high as FM650m compared with a loss of FM158m last year.
A sharply rising trend in Nokia shares suggests that the message has been
well received. This week the price approached the FM200 mark, unchecked by
the issue of 6m new shares and more than three times the level in early
1992.
However, a cynical shareholder might well respond by saying 'about time,
too'.
The recovery apparently well under way at Nokia follows a long period of
turmoil during which a series of hastily-assembled acquisitions in the late
1980s turned the group into an unwieldy high-technology conglomerate that
stumbled into heavy losses and obscured the progress of its
telecommunications business.
Nokia is struggling with some of the legacy of that time: its loss-making
consumer electronics division, still accounting for more than 30 per cent of
overall sales, was responsible for the group's loss last year.
The division, mainly making colour televisions for the depressed European
market, is not expected to break even until 1994.
Consumer electronics was one of the areas Nokia moved into in the 1980s
under the charismatic leadership of Mr Kari Kairamo.
Before his suicide in late 1988, he had added telecommunications and
computers, as well as televisions and radios, to Nokia's traditional role as
a paper, rubber goods and cable manufacturer built up since it was founded
in 1865.
The rush to expand was soon revealed as ill-judged. The acquisition in 1988
of Swedish rival Ericsson's data systems business, which became Nokia Data,
was followed in 1991 by its sale to Fujitsu-owned ICL of Britain.
Ericsson sold out because it had found it hard to combine computers with its
core telecommunications business and wanted to concentrate on the latter.
Nokia learnt the same lesson, but three years later.
It was not lost on Mr Ollila. Although chief financial officer under Mr
Kairamo, he makes no bones about the mistakes and led something of a
management purge when he took over in January last year. He replaced the
heads of the four main Nokia divisions, telecommunications, mobile phones,
consumer electronics and cables and machinery, and sold off what remained of
Nokia's paper businesses.
A strategy of focusing on the telecommunications market is in place, driven
by a young team. The average age among Nokia's top 12 executives is now 44,
and just 32 among managers in the telecommunications divisions. Mr Ollila is
still a month short of his 43rd birthday. Mr Pekka Ala-Pietila, who
succeeded Mr Ollila as head of mobile phones, is just 36.
'I think that youth is a tremendous asset in a business that is changing
fast,' Mr Ollila says.
Nokia is betting its future on its strength in low-cost fixed telephone
systems, based on many off-the-shelf components, and in mobile telephone
systems and handsets. In spite of only coming to the telecommunications
business in the 1970s, Nokia has built up a strong background of expertise
in both areas.
Like Ericsson, it benefited from the establishment, in the early 1980s, of a
pan-Nordic mobile telephone standard and the emergence of the Nordic
countries as world leaders in mobile phone penetration. Sweden and Finland,
with 7.9 and 7.1 mobile phones per 100 people respectively, top the world
league, compared to 4.9 in the US. Japan is still not in the top 10 on this
measurement. Nokia is a market leader - second in the world to Ericsson - in
equipping digital telephone networks. It remains strong in analog systems,
but is banking on a strong growth in demand for the more expensive digital
systems, such as Europe's GSM networks, throughout the rest of the 1990s.
It will make its first move into Japan in digital mobile phones next year
and intends to increase significantly the 16 per cent share of its FM20bn
annual worldwide sales currently made in Asia. At present, 9 per cent of
sales are in the US and the remainder in Europe. With half of its production
still in Finland, Nokia has benefited from the 30 per cent decline in the
value of the Finnish markka in the past year.
Mr Ollila says he is happy to stay in home-based manufacturing now that the
'horrible' relative costs of a few years ago have been eroded.
He says he is happy to keep in the group its residual tyre and power
businesses, in spite of their incongruity, because they are in profit and
produce healthy cash flow.
For the time being, Mr Ollila is at pains to deny persistent market
speculation that the consumer electronics business, in which four out of six
TV manufacturing plants have been closed, will be sold off.
A recent estimate by analysts Alfred Berg showed Nokia's anticipated
earnings per share in 1993 of FM6.00 would double to FM12.30 if the consumer
electronics side was disposed of.
Mr Ollila says Nokia is looking for partnership agreements, not a buyer, but
adds: 'We are working to reduce our exposure to consumer electronics. In
future it will not be the 30 per cent of sales it is today.'

<TEXT>
AEG's domestic appliances division is to extend its co-operation with
Electrolux, the Swedish multinational with which it recently swapped
minority share stakes.
Decisions on co-operation in other product areas, apart from an existing
link in laundry appliances and dishwashers, could be expected in the autumn,
the Daimler-Benz subsidiary said yesterday.
Meanwhile, cost-cutting measures were continuing in the light of an expected
marked weakening in deliveries this year, Mr Carlhanns Damm, AEG chairman
said yesterday.
The workforce was being reduced by more than 500 to 8,500. Export markets
were especially weak, he said, and a 1 per cent increase in sales by the
German parent in the first half was due to domestic demand. Profits would be
hit by lower exports and exchange rate losses, Mr Damm added.
The slowdown followed a successful year in which turnover had been aided by
strong demand from eastern Germany, and improvements in the group's costs
structure, including the loss of 500 employees, had lifted net earnings to
DM60m (Dollars 37.5m) from DM28m in 1991. Sales rose to DM2.33bn from
DM2.22bn.
AEG and Electrolux were satisfied with the results of their first six
months' co-operation, Mr Damm said.
Under the present deal, the companies manufacture washing machines jointly,
and AEG supplies Electrolux with clothes dryers and dishwashers.

NORWAY'S finance ministry will free Uni Storebrand, the country's biggest
insurer, from public administration on July 13.
The move, announced yesterday, is conditional on Uni's creditors demanding
no more than NKr420m (Dollars 60.9m), or an average interest rate of 11 per
cent, in interest payments since the time Uni was put under state control
after it collapsed last August. Uni's debts will be repaid in full, the
ministry said. However, some of Uni's creditors said Norwegian law would
allow higher rates of interest to be repaid.
Uni collapsed with debt of NKr3.8bn used to finance a failed raid on Skandia
Forsakrings, Sweden's biggest insurer.
The move follows a recapitalisation of the group in which a recent share
offer raised NKr2.8bn and a bond issue raised another NKr1.5bn.

<TEXT>
NIKE, the US athletic shoe manufacturer, yesterday sought to reassure Wall
Street over last month's sharp share price fall, triggered by a warning of
lower-than-expected fiscal 1994 growth.
'The recent volatility in our stock is not consistent with the superior
results we have generated over the past six years or with the potential
growth we see in the future,' said Mr Philip Knight, chairman.
The company announced that its board had authorised a plan to repurchase up
to Dollars 450m of Nike class B common stock over the next three years.
It also reported an 8.8 per cent rise in fourth-quarter 1993 net income, to
Dollars 76.9m, or Dollars 1 a share, compared with Dollars 70.7m, or 92
cents, in the same period last year. Revenues rose 16 per cent to Dollars
983.3m.
The figures were broadly in line with market expectations. They combined
with Nike's other announcements to boost its shares Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars
56 1/8 in morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
In the fourth quarter, its US athletic business saw revenues rise 13 per
cent to Dollars 521m. US footwear revenues were up 21 per cent at Dollars
446m, while apparel revenues dipped 21 per cent ot Dollars 75m.
International revenues rose 18 per cent to Dollars 406m, with footwear sales
up 15 per cent to Dollars 295m and apparel up 25 per cent at Dollars 111m.
Consolidated gross margins totalled 39.5 per cent, up from 38.6 per cent,
while selling and administrative expenses were 26.2 per cent of revenues, up
from 25.3 per cent.
For the full 1993 year the company reported net income of Dollars 365m, or
Dollars 4.74 a share, up 10 per cent from the Dollars 329.2m, or Dollars
4.30, reported last year. Revenues rose 15 per cent to Dollars 3.9bn.
Mr Knight said he believed 1994 would be Nike's seventh consecutive record
year, although several factors could cause its growth rate to slow
temporarily.
Continued weakness in Europe's larger economies and a stronger US dollar
would limit international growth, while US retailers appeared to be ordering
cautiously for the Christmas holiday season.
However, he said these were temporary conditions and would not hamper growth
in its international business.

DEUTSCHE Bank reiterated yesterday that it had no plans to reduce its 28 per
cent stake in Daimler-Benz, Germany's largest industrial holding.
This followed comments from Mr Edzard Reuter, Daimler-Benz chief executive,
that he expected Deutsche to cut the stake 'in the medium-term'. He told
journalists in Nuremberg that after such a move, Deutsche would remain a
large and valued shareholder. Mr Reuter's comments revived speculation that
Deutsche was considering cutting the stake which it has owned in Daimler
since the late 1920s, the biggest holding in the bank's portfolio of
share-stakes in large German companies.
Earlier this year, Mr Ronaldo Schmitz, a board director of the bank, told a
meeting of investors in Dusseldorf that the two companies agreed that the
stake should be cut 'before too long'.
Daimler and Deutsche have denied there were any plans for a reduction in the
stake. However, the fact that the issue is being talked about in public
shows the extent to which Germany's industrial and financial establishment
is prepared to consider radical steps amid economic downturn.
Analysts suggest that one way for the Deutsche Bank to reduce its stake
would be for it not to take up its entitlement to shares in a future Daimler
rights issue.

GOLD GREENLEES Trott, the advertising and marketing services group,
yesterday reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 4.32m for the year to April 30,
in line with analysts' expectations and up 6 per cent on the previous Pounds
4.09m which was after exceptional items.
Turnover increased 18 per cent to Pounds 275.4m (Pounds 234.1m). Operating
profits were up by 13 per cent at Pounds 5.84m (Pounds 5.16m) and the final
dividend is 5p on capital increased by the April rights issue, making an
unchanged total of 8.3p for the year.
The group benefited from the beginning of the end of the recession in the
US; GGT's US agencies last year accounted for some 60 per cent of the
group's profits, up by about 10 per cent on the previous year. Gross profit
from US subsidiaries was up by 21 per cent in dollar terms.
The group's Pounds 14.7m rights issue was 92.4 per cent taken up, and its
joint venture with the GGK network of continental European advertising
agencies last month will give it greater clout in pitching for pan-European
accounts, according to Mr Mike Greenlees, GGT's chairman.
Mr Greenlees said the current year had started well for the group, with the
Nationwide Building Society's Pounds 15m advertising account being one of
its significant wins.
Earnings were down 5 per cent at 15.63p (16.49p), which the group said was
due to an unusually low tax charge in 1992. Net profits were static at
Pounds 3.21m. The group now has a net cash balance of about Pounds 5m.
Analysts are forecasting pre-tax profits of about Pounds 6m for the current
year.

FT  09 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Microgen down and warns of year's shortfall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES IN Microgen Holdings fell 12p to 173p yesterday after the specialist
computer services group reported first half pre-tax profits down 14 per cent
and warned on current trading.
Mr Douglas Lee, chairman, said continuing economic uncertainties made it
unlikely that trading in the second half would make up the reported
shortfall. However, the core computer output microfilm (Com) business was
seeing volumes stabilise.
Pre-tax profits were down from Pounds 4.37m to Pounds 3.76m for the period
ended April 30 1993, while turnover rose to Pounds 26.1m (Pounds 25m).
The smaller electronic print division improved sales to Pounds 8.73m (Pounds
7.16m) partly on the back of higher revenue from new customised services.
Mr Lee said the group had been subject to intensified pressure on margins,
particularly in the UK and Scandinavia where the recession continued.
This had been felt most strongly in the traditional Com business where
reductions in revenues and profits had a significant impact on results.
The German company had 'performed well', increasing turnover and profit by
about 9 per cent in D-Mark and 30 per cent in sterling terms There was some
evidence that the onset of recession in Germany would affect the Com
business, but this should be offset by the growth in customised services.
Mr Lee said Microgen's planned development into a broadly-based provider of
computer output management services continued.
Looking to the longer term he said the strategy was sound. Although it might
take some time for this to show through in terms of progressive profit
growth, strong evidence that confidence was well founded was provided by the
underlying progress in revenue growth from the new services.
Since the half-year end the Scandinavian holding company had bought two
computer output service businesses in Norway at a total cost of Pounds
1.76m. These will be integrated and make a first contribution in the next
year.
At April 30 the net cash balance had increased to Pounds 3.56m (Pounds
2.48m). There was net interest received of Pounds 77,000, compared with
payments of Pounds 57,000.
The interim dividend is maintained at 2.2p out of earnings per share down at
6.1p (7.1p).

FT  09 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Cellular Telecom late in filing accounts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A COMPANY linked to family interests of Mr Clive Smith, the Midlands
entrepreneur, and which shared directors with Alpine (Double Glazing), the
windows company which recently collapsed, is more than two months late
filing accounts.
Cellular Telecom Holdings, based at Maidenhead, retails airtime on the
Vodafone and Cellnet networks. It was required by company law to have
submitted audited accounts within seven months of its September 30 year-end.
However, the last filing was for the 18 months to the end of September 1991,
when Cellular Telecom showed a pre-tax loss of Pounds 179,890 on sales of
Pounds 11.5m.
In recent weeks the Bank of Scotland has lodged a charge over the assets of
the company for 'all moneys (sic) and liabilities (actual or contingent)'
owed to the bank. In Cellular Telecom's last accounts, the Royal Bank of
Scotland and Midland Bank were listed as its bankers.
Mr Marc Voulters, a partner of Cellular Telecom's auditors Casson Beckman,
confirmed recently that the accounts were late. He said he expected they
would now be filed within the next week or so.
Cellular Telecom is more than 55 per cent owned by offshore companies,
according to the 1991 accounts, with a further 23.9 per cent held in nominee
accounts. Two of the offshore companies - holding a total stake of 18.78 per
cent - are beneficially owned by Mr Smith's two daughters.
The company has also shared two directors with Alpine (Double Glazing) - Mr
Robert Pollock, chairman of the windows company and discharged bankrupt, and
Mr James Berry. Mr Pollock said at a recent Alpine creditors' meeting that
the windows group had provided a letter of financial support to Cellular
Telecom for just under Pounds 300,000 in 1992.
Directors of Cellular Telecom have been unavailable for comment. However,
early last month Mr Pollock and Mr Berry resigned from the company. Mr
Pollock's contract, which provided for an annual salary of Pounds 60,000,
ran until December 31 1993, after which six months notice was required for
termination.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
PRE-TAX profits dropped from Pounds 4.62m to Pounds 3.5m at Burtonwood
Brewery in the year to March 31.
The Cheshire-based company pointed out, however, that the figures last time
included property profits, and stripping those out, the trading results were
27 per cent ahead.
Turnover rose from Pounds 44.7m to Pounds 50.3m and beer volumes also
improved 13 per cent.
A 'significant impact' was made by the first full-year contribution from the
132 houses acquired on 25-year leases, the company said. A further 49 pubs
had been acquired during the year.
Earnings per share were 12p (18.6p) and a proposed final dividend of 3.98p
(3.75p) lifts the total to 4.68p (4.45p).

FT  09 JUL 93 / UK Company News: French closure costs put Darby Pounds 2.8m
in the red
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DARBY GROUP, the specialist glass maker currently traded on the London Stock
Exchange Alternative Trading Service, has moved into a loss of Pounds 2.76m
in the year ended February 28 1993 as the cost of closing the French
operations hit hard.
The loss compared with a profit of Pounds 285,000. No dividend is being paid
(2p total last time). Losses per share were 16.68p (earnings 2.51p).
Turnover fell to Pounds 17.6m (Pounds 17.9m), including a Pounds 3.97m
contribution from discontinued operations.
Closure of Darby France accounted for Pounds 2.43m of pre-tax losses. Mr
Michael Darby, chairman and chief executive, said the recession in
continental Europe became increasingly severe during last year with the
French market being particularly adversely affected.'
He said selling prices and margins were squeezed and the group saw no
improvement in industrial relations.
A further Pounds 177,000 was charged to profits to cover the costs of
failing to establish a US market after a concerted effort since 1989. The
group will continue exporting.
Mr Darby said continuing activities, now UK trading operations, would
concentrate on manufacturing high value speciality products.
The second half was little different to the first, with very similar levels
of profitability. That was encouraging, he said, since it was the first six
month period for several years where there had not been a deterioration in
UK business.

FT  09 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Looking to computer technology for growth -
After centuries of papermaking, Portals sees a future in electronics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PORTALS has been producing banknote paper since 1712 when Henri de Portal, a
French refugee, set up a paper mill in Hampshire. Twelve years later the
company was supplying the Bank of England with its banknote paper, a
contract which it still holds today.
After the first world war the Bank of England allowed Portals to manufacture
paper for other banking and trade authorities and the group won its first
foreign government contract in 1921.
This century the demand for security paper has been fuelled by monetary
inflation, the emergence of post-colonial independent nations and most
recently the break-up of the Soviet bloc.
Security papermaking, augmented more recently by other specialist
papermaking activities such as teabag manufacturing, has proved an
appropriately mature niche business, delivering a steady performance. Last
year the division generated just over half of Portals' Pounds 194m turnover
and 70 per cent of profits.
But since 1988, when Portals acquired the Paragon electrical engineering
group and a new chief executive, Mr Michael Morley along with it, the
management has looked increasingly to the emerging protection and control
division to provide future growth.
This relatively new division groups together a handful of environmental
services, engineering and computer technology businesses. It has grown
quickly over the past five years although its profit contribution has
lagged, mainly because of of Airol-Flaregas, the lossmaking manufacturer of
low-emission burners for the petrochemical industry which was finally sold
in January.
That sale should enable Mr John Cope, a main-board director since September,
to pursue the goal of turning the division, and the Portals Computer
Technology businesses in particular, into Portals' 'engine for growth'.
Servalec, a small company based south of Sheffield, symbolises this
aspiration. The company which employs 220 people, three-quarters of them
engineers, provides its customers with highly sophisticated software
products and fully integrated systems built around a core software package
called 'Scope', which runs on desktop computers and workstations.
Servalec's products 'enable its customers to better control and manage their
businesses', says Mr Cope, one of the company's founder shareholders.
That means not only providing them with the information tools to improve
cost effectiveness and efficiency, but also enabling companies to meet the
growing burden of legislative, environmental and safety requirements.
Servalec, which posted pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.96m (Pounds 1.56m) on
turnover of Pounds 12.9m (Pounds 12.2m) last year, began in the late 1970s
designing and building process control systems for British Steel - an
industrial heritage which Mr Cope believes gives the small company a
distinct advantage over some of its larger rivals which include Logica and
EDS Scion.
Since then it has substantially broadened its customer base to include many
blue chip customers in the water, oil and gas, and food industries as well
as those in more traditional industrial sectors.
Building integrated systems around standard computer hardware platforms,
together with specialised microprocessor-based equipment supplied by two
smaller sister companies - Seprol and Technolog - Servalec has been
particularly successful winning customers for its telemetry systems in the
water industry.
All of the regional water authorities already have computer-based telemetry
systems, which enable managers and supervisors to monitor and control remote
sites like pumping stations or water treatment plants. However, the need to
upgrade and refurbish these systems provides a continuing source of
business.
More importantly in terms of growth, Servalec won a Pounds 2.8m contract
last year from Anglia National Rivers Authority for a regional telemetry
system which is integrated with a flood forecasting system. Other river
authorities are expected to follow suit and some analysts, including Mr
David McCrossan of Kleinwort Benson research, have estimated that this
market alone could be worth between Pounds 50m and Pounds 100m over the next
10 years.
However Servalec's information gathering, control and analysis systems
potentially have many other applications.
Under one new contract worth Pounds 3m the company is building a
'supervisory control and data acquisition' system for the BBC which is
designed to monitor automatically almost 400 transmitter sites throughout
the UK.
The system contains predictive facilities to enable the BBC to anticipate
technical, security and other problems at transmitter sites and take
precautionary action.
Under another large contract Servalec is designing a replacement control and
monitoring system which will cover all the main utility services - including
the runway lights - at Heathrow airport.
Both Mr Cope and Mr Alan Gilby, Servalec's managing director, believe there
is a substantial pent-up demand for systems which combine the features of
traditional process control with management information systems. These can
then be integrated with other computer-based systems like financial
accounting and database systems to provide managers with a more
comprehensive view of their business.
But by designing the system from bottom-up, rather than from top-down, Mr
Cope insists Servalec can provide more effective products than many of its
competitors.
However, he accepts that if Servalec has a weakness it is 'in terms of our
marketing skills.' This, he says, is now being corrected.
Driven by recession-resistant factors like environmental and safety
concerns, as well as the desire for greater efficiency, Mr Cope believes
Servalec and Portals Computer Technology can deliver the kind of accelerated
growth Portals is seeking to offset its maturing papermaking business.

FT  09 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Authority pension schemes win best returns
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LOCAL Authority Superann-uation Funds, the pension schemes of local
authorities, earned significantly better returns on their assets in the year
to March 31 than did other pension schemes.
According to the WM Company, a performance measurement service, local
authorities earned total returns on average of 24.5 per cent for that 12
month period compared with returns for the industry as a whole of 23.3 per
cent.
'The difference has occurred due to the better UK equity stock selection of
local authority funds,' WM Company said.
Of the 20 top performing funds, 18 had better than average stock selection,
while all of the bottom 20 funds had lower than average stock selection.
Thus, policy or asset mix have proved less significant to a fund's
performance than the manager's ability to pick stocks.
The performance represents the best annual return for local authorities
since the 1985-86 fiscal year. Among the funds, larger ones with assets of
Pounds 500m or more outperformed the average in UK equities.
The return of 26.8 per cent was better than in any other size band and has
been a consistent feature of large funds with better returns over five and
10 years. However, the ability to outperform in UK equities is not reflected
in total assets.
The WM Company noted that the level of new money coming into local authority
funds has fallen to its lowest level ever, partly reflecting the declining
numbers of direct local authority employees.

FT  09 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Too close for Owners' comfort / Considering
the resignations at a travel operator
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TO THE UK travel industry, yesterday's resignations at Owners Abroad were as
big a shock as waking up in a holiday hotel to find the roof had blown away.
Those who had not yet heard that Mr Howard Klein, chairman, and Mr Roger
Allard, managing director, were stepping down reacted with disbelief.
After allowing the news to sink in, most thought it wiser not to comment.
Owners Abroad's account of events leading up to its warning that full-year
profits were likely to be half of market expectations is potentially a
landmark event for the industry.
Independent travel groups will point to events at Owners Abroad as evidence
that the growth of the largest travel groups is damaging to everyone, even
the well-established companies.
For the big groups, the fear is that the resignations will increase pressure
on the competition authorities to limit the links between tour operators and
travel agents.
Mr Klein yesterday identified the links, which the Office of Fair Trading is
currently examining, as one of the principal reasons for his downfall.
Mr Klein said yesterday that the group's problems began after Easter.
By the end of April, he said, Owners Abroad had sold 55 per cent of its 1.6m
summer holidays at full price. After that, three factors caused the group's
position to deteriorate sharply.
These were severe price competition, customers' preference this year for
Spain rather than the eastern Mediterranean, and 'directional selling' or
travel agents favouring the holidays of the tour operators which own them.
Many in the industry will entertain another suspicion. Owners Abroad's
profits for the year were never going to be that good anyway but its
prospects were puffed up to maintain the group's independence.
Earlier this year, Owners Abroad successfully fought off a takeover bid from
Airtours, a rival tour operator.
Owners Abroad managed to persuade key shareholders to reject the bid on the
grounds that it could do better on its own. Mr Klein argued that a proposed
tie-up with travel agents Thomas Cook was a better option.
Last night, Mr Klein categorically denied that shareholders had been misled.
However many in the industry will continue to ask questions.
This is not the result of personal antagonism towards Mr Klein and Mr
Allard.
Mr Klein, a solicitor who joined Owners Abroad in 1982, is more amiable and
approachable than the heads of most other travel groups.
Mr Allard, famed for his inability to complete any sentence he starts, is
reckoned to know more about the selling of charter airline seats than anyone
alive.
Much of the scepticism will come instead from an examination of the three
reasons advanced for the group's crisis.
The first was that the group was damaged by severe price competition. Mr
Klein last year said the severe price competition in 1992 was a
non-recurring event. Last night, he said it had recurred in 1993.
Owners Abroad, he said, had misread what the market wanted. 'We thought
people would want quality. We thought people would want to go to a better
type of hotel. But all those things have to be paid for. It appears people
don't want to pay for it.'
Mr Bruce Shepherd, retail sales director of AT Mays, the only large travel
agents' chain which is not owned by a UK tour operator, said last night he
found Mr Klein's view difficult to understand.
Owners Abroad had a range of holiday brands, from Sovereign, at the top end
of the market, to several budget holiday names. Both sorts of offering
appeared to have their appeal, he said.
Owners Abroad shareholders are entitled to feel that stiff price competition
is hardly a new travel industry phenomenon.
If Owners Abroad thought its holidays were too expensive, perhaps it should
have advised shareholders to accept the offer from the determinedly
down-market Airtours.
The second reason advanced for Owners Abroad's problems, that it had
concentrated too heavily on the eastern Mediterranean and not enough on
Spain, does not say much for the group's management.
It is true that Cyprus is experiencing difficulties. Having proved too
popular last year for the good of the island, Cyprus has this year set its
prices too high for many recession-hit travellers. Greece has suffered from
a new departure tax.
Regardless of such transitory problems, no well-run holiday company should
have regarded the eastern Mediterranean as a safe region on which to pin
one's hopes.
The Gulf War had already demonstrated the vulnerability of holiday
destinations so close to centres of potential conflict.
It is the third reason advanced by Mr Klein, that the channels of
distribution are increasingly monopolised by a small number of tour
operators, that has to be taken the most seriously.
Mr David Crossland, chairman of Airtours, has made no secret of his aim of
using his recently-acquired Pickfords Travel and Hogg Robinson retail
outlets to push the tour operator's own holidays.
For the first time, Thomson has begun to use its Lunn Poly chain in the same
way.
When the OFT's investigation was announced last month, Mr Klein was quick to
ridicule it. Last night, unsurprisingly, he appeared to think it had a
point.
If large companies like Owners Abroad found it difficult to sell through the
tied agents, how would small operators manage?
'It's potentially very damaging. The small guys are going to have a very
difficult time,' Mr Klein said.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
HSBC Investment Banking Group, the investment banking businesses of Hongkong
and Shanghai Bank, has established a holding company with roughly Dollars
1.2bn (Pounds 800m) in capital which draws disparate parts of the company
into a single new unit.
The move is part of a reorganisation of the bank's businesses following its
acquisition of Midland Bank last year. Mr Bernard Asher, chairman of HSBC
Investment Banking, said: 'This means that the things we set out to
accomplish by the acquisition of Midland have been accomplished.'
The ability of HSBC to exploit fully its Midland acquisition by achieving
synergies between the disparate units has been questioned by some
institutional shareholders and analysts. But Mr Asher said that HSBC had
moved swiftly to achieve that.
Prior to the reorganisation, which has taken more than 10 months to achieve,
HSBC had four separate investment banking and securities operations.
The four are James Capel and Co, the stockbroker, Samuel Montagu, European
and US merchant bank, Wardley Group, a Hong Kong-based investment bank with
activities throughout the world and HSBC Asset Management, which has total
assets under management of Dollars 28bn, of which about 60 per cent is for
retail and private clients.
Mr Asher said the purpose of the reorganisation was 'cross fertilisation'
allowing each unit to realise new commercial opportunities from business
relationships in other units.

FT  09 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Hanson drives jump in overseas acquisitions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE VOLUME of British companies' overseas acquisitions more than trebled to
Dollars 9.9bn (Pounds 6.6bn) in the first half of 1993 from Dollars 3bn in
the same period last year, according to KPMG Peat Marwick, the accountants
and consultants.
The increase, which comes against the declining trend in continental Europe,
was driven by Hanson's Dollars 3.2bn agreed bid for the US company Quantum
Chemical.
Mr Richard Agutter, head of mergers and acquisitions at KPMG, said Britain
was one of the first countries to enter recession, along with the US and
Canada. The three countries then experienced a corresponding downturn in
cross border M&amp;A.
However, 'in recent months each has shown some sign of recovery, although
the indicators have been uncertain and have not been as consistent as we
would wish for.
'The increase in acquisition activity in these countries does, however,
demonstrate and add to the level of business confidence.'
US purchases were up 39 per cent to Dollars 6.2bn (Dollars 4.5bn) and
Canadian purchases leapt to Dollars 2bn (Dollars 599m).
Over the same period the recession in continental Europe has contributed to
a 40 per cent fall in the volume of cross-border M&amp;A world-wide, preliminary
figures from KPMG's deal watch survey show.
Cross-border acquisitions worldwide amounted to Dollars 25.1bn (Dollars
42.2bn) in the first half.
French buying activity declined most sharply to Dollars 428m (Dollars
8.7bn).
Italian purchases also fell, held back by the criminal investigations into
political and business corruption, but no values were disclosed.

FT  09 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Peel Holdings advances 34% and shares rise
23p
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PEEL HOLDINGS, the prop-erty company, has defied the recession with a 34 per
cent rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds 9.4m for the year to March 31,
against Pounds 7.01m, on turnover down from Pounds 76.2m to Pounds 68.1m.
The shares rose 23p yesterday to close at 233p.
Fully diluted net assets per share of the company, which also controls the
separately-listed Manchester Ship Canal, rose by 9p over the year to 315p.
After a tax charge this time of Pounds 2.1m, against a credit last time of
Pounds 5.63m, earnings per share were 2.41p (8.01p). The board is
recommending a final dividend of 3p, making a total for the year of 4p (3p).
The company attributed its ability to survive the recession to the sectoral
diversity and geographical spread of its property portfolio and its ability
to generate windfall profits from sale of dominant landholdings.
Mr John Whittaker, chairman, said: 'There are now signs of improvement in
the property market and it would be safe to assume the worst is now over.'
At the year end shareholders' funds were up Pounds 1.52m at Pounds 303.5m
and net borrowings were static at Pounds 336.1m (Pounds 335.1m). Gearing
rose to 99.2 per cent, compared with 94.6 per cent.
Peel's confidence can be gauged from its voluntary cancellation of Pounds
50m of bank facilities last November and its intention to repay Pounds 75m
to its consortium of bankers this November.
New facilities have recently been negotiated at Pounds 30m for up to three
years and Peel is investigating taking on more fixed rate borrowings while
the climate is favourable.
Property sales realised Pounds 56.53m at a profit of Pounds 3.38m, bringing
the sales during the last three years to Pounds 265m in spite of recession.
Mr Whittaker said the sales had reduced debt, funded the acquisition of more
of the Ship Canal and increase profits at a time when interest rates on
variable borrowings exceeded relevant rental income. Peel's Ship Canal stake
is now 82 per cent, bought mainly from Mr Whittaker's private family
interests
Oversupply and weak demand in the office and industrial sectors meant fresh
voids of Pounds 1.59m on unlet property more than offset new rental income
of Pounds 1.26m. Mr Whittaker said total voids were 'unacceptably high' at
Pounds 6m, of which Pounds 1.7m is concentrated in Salford Quays, Greater
Manchester's equivalent of London docklands.
Peel said there had been strong interest from leading retailers in the
Trafford Centre, which it plans to build on 300 acres owned by the Ship
Canal at Dumplington on the edge of Trafford Park.
Mr Whittaker said he was confident a High Court appeal by eight local
authorities against planning permission for the centre would fail, as
arguments about protecting existing town centre shops were a repeat of those
at previous public inquiries.

FT  09 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Cleggs sell Anglo Irish stake
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE 14.98 per cent Clegg family holding in Anglo Irish Bank Corporation has
been sold by Mrs Jayne Wright for about Pounds 10.8m.
Mrs Wright is the half-sister of Mr John Clegg, once a director of the bank
and the former managing director of Wace, the UK-based pre-press and
specialist printing group.
Mr Clegg departed Wace suddenly as the DTI investigated share dealings,
conducted in the name of some of his relatives, in Parkway, a Wace
acquisition.
Mr Willie McAteer, Anglo Irish finance director, said there had been 'no
encouragement' to Mrs Wright to sell - indeed there had been no contact with
the Clegg family for 12 months.
The shares had been bought by a number of Irish, UK and US institutions.
He said that in 1984 the family viewing the bank, then known as City of
Dublin Bank, as undervalued, had bought a stake of about 17 1/2 per cent.
They had since subscribed for all their rights, not allowing the stake to
dilute.
Mr McAteer said they had taken up their rights on 9m shares in this
February's 1-for-1 issue at 46p. However, he did not know the cost of the
original stake.
He added that it would not now be possible to acquire such a stake.
In 1984 rules were imposed by the Central Bank of Ireland outlawing holdings
of more than 10 per cent by individuals without approval.
He suggested that Mrs Wright had always been the owner of the shares and Mr
Clegg was the stake's representative on the board.

FT  09 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Five Heron creditors challenge refinancing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FIVE CREDITORS of Heron, Mr Gerald Ronson's property and trading group, have
carried out a threat to challenge its refinancing proposals in the courts.
They opposed an application to the UK courts to sanction the schemes.
Each side now has to file further evidence and a hearing is expected in the
week beginning July 26. Heron had hoped that the schemes would be ratified
by the end of this month.
The five, which together claim to be owed Dollars 42m (Pounds 28m) by Heron,
are led by Mr Simon Shane, against whom Heron has filed a complaint in New
York, alleging 'breach of duties and obligations, fraud and negligent
misrepresentation'.
Heron said yesterday: 'Mr Shane has a vested interest in attempting to
interfere with Heron's restructuring thus forcing Heron into formal
insolvency proceedings which would be to the detriment of creditors as a
whole.'
The proposals, involving the restructuring of Heron's Pounds 1.4bn of debt,
were approved by large majorities of creditors at three meetings in the last
two weeks. They have also been accepted by Heron's 82 banks. However, the
schemes have to be ratified by the courts in the three jurisdictions where
the creditors meetings were held.
Heron said that it was taking the legal intervention seriously, but felt
that the courts would take account of the votes by creditors at the
meetings. At the UK meeting, of those creditors who voted more than 80 per
cent by value and 75 per cent by number were in favour. Mr Shane's legal
representative spoke at that meeting, raising the issues which are now being
put to the court.
The five creditors include First Eastern Developments, a Bermuda-based
property consultancy headed by Mr Shane, and an associated company,
Stratagem Development Corporation, which is suing Heron over a property
development in New York. Heron is counter-claiming.
The five creditors said that the documents sent to creditors explaining the
proposals gave insufficient information for creditors 'to reach a decision
on the merits of the schemes'.
They also claimed the the proposals, which involve the issue of bonds
representing senior and junior debt, could have 'serious consequences for
certain categories of US creditors' because the securities will not be
registered in the US.

FT  09 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Strong support for cask beers bolsters
Greene King
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GREENE KING's strong advertising and promotional support for its cask beers
helped increase trading profits from Pounds 25.3m to Pounds 26.8m in the
year to May 2 on increased sales of Pounds 133.6m, compared with Pounds
128.6m.
However, after losses on property disposals, against profits, and a higher
interest charge the pre-tax profit fell slightly from Pounds 20.3m to Pounds
20.1m.
Mr Simon Redman, chairman, said the trading performance for brewers in the
south- east of England remained very difficult. He believed brands, such as
Greene King IPA and Abbot Ale, should perform better as more buoyant
conditions return.
Free trade business accounted for 55 per cent of volume sales. Bad debts
rose from Pounds 1.8m to Pounds 2.1m, which Mr Redman said reflected the
continuing difficulties of the recession.
A breakdown of trading profits showed wholesaling contributed Pounds 23.2m
(Pounds 22.8m), retailing Pounds 8.75m (Pounds 8.18m), production and
distribution Pounds 2.8m (Pounds 1.98m) and wine merchants Pounds 682,000
(Pounds 967,000). Central costs were little changed at Pounds 8.57m (Pounds
8.63m).
Mr Redman said he expected Butterfly Hotels, in which the brewer has a 35
per cent interest, to break even for the present year after reporting a loss
in the year underreview.
Earnings per share fell from 36.1p to 35.4p. The proposed final dividend
however, is raised to 8.6p (8.1p) making a total payment for the year of
12.3p (11.6p).
COMMENT
It is not impossible to take over a brewer but there is a price to be paid.
It is unlikely to be one that Mr Redman is willing to pay. Notwithstanding
the fall in interest rates, reducing the carrying cost of its holding in
Morland, Greene King would do well to sell its stake. This would enable it
to concentrate on expanding the group organically. Mr Redman has already
hinted as much, although he insists that all options remain open. Abbott and
IPA are strong brands, which should perform better over the next year given
their strong advertising and promotional support. With forecast pre-tax
profits for the year of Pounds 22m, the shares are on a prospective multiple
of 13.6, which is just ahead of the market sector's average.

Dewhurst, maker of electrical products and control equipment, increased
turnover 23 per cent and pre-tax profit 30 per cent in the half year ended
March 28 1993.
However, the output of rail products was declining because of the delay of
investment projects. Traditional markets remained depressed but a modest
improvement was expected in full year profit over the previous Pounds
850,000.
Turnover for the period was Pounds 5.17m (Pounds 4.21m) and profit Pounds
404,000 (Pounds 310,000). Earnings came to 2.36p (1.85p) and the interim

Stewart &amp; Wight, property investor, raised its pre-tax profit from Pounds
352,000 to Pounds 372,000 in the year ended March 31 1993.
Rental income improved to Pounds 419,000 (Pounds 400,000). In general,
tenants have continued to keep up their rental commitments. However, it was
expected that income from the Bishopsgate property would be reduced
considerably because of a number of the tenancies expiring this year.
Earnings per share came to 324.43p (299.04p) and the dividend is increased

A strong recovery at its diesel power engineering division helped Associated
British Engineering report a sharp increase in pre-tax profits from Pounds
35,000 to Pounds 216,000 in the 12 months to March 31.
This also marked an improvement from the half-way stage when the group

Sales advanced 21 per cent to Pounds 41.5m (Pounds 34.2m).
Diesel power contributed profits of Pounds 149,000 against a Pounds 12,000
loss previously. Middle East operations increased their input to Pounds
635,000 (Pounds 543,000) and marine diesel spares and service put in Pounds
381,000 (Pounds 272,000).
However catering equipment suffered an increased loss of Pounds 366,000
(Pounds 141,000).
The dividend is maintained at 0.05p on earnings per share of 0.01p (losses

GIBBON LYONS, maker of printing inks and related products, finished the year
ended March 31 1993 with a pre-tax profit of Pounds 1.41m, a rise of 75 per
cent on the previous Pounds 806,000.
However, in the full accounts the profit will fall to Pounds 990,000 after
writing off goodwill on the sale of Gibbon Marler bv. The shares rose 6p to
104p.
Mr Michael Gibbon, chairman, said the group continued to perform well in the
second half, although there had been no significant improvement in trading
conditions. Tight control of costs meant it could compete at reduced
margins.
Turnover for the year showed little change at Pounds 23.1m (Pounds 22.8m).
Earnings per share worked through at 9.4p (4.8p) and the final dividend is
3p for an unchanged total of 5p.

FT  09 JUL 93 / Greene King 'very unlikely' to make new Morland bid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR SIMON Redman, chairman of Greene King, the brewer which failed to take
over its rival Morland last year, said he was 'very unlikely' to make
another hostile bid for that target.
He said Greene King would retain its 29.3 per cent stake in Morland, for
'the time being'. The remark was interpreted by analysts as signalling
Greene King's intention to sell its Morland stake. The Pounds 1.7m net cost
of carrying the stake raised the brewer's interest charges from Pounds 5.5m
to Pounds 7.3m contributing to a small fall in pre-tax profits, from Pounds
20.3m to Pounds 20.1m. Borrowings rose to Pounds 79m (Pounds 48.8m).
Since Greene King acquired its stake, Morland's shares have risen from 450p
to yesterday's closing price of 543p. Greene King's shares yesterday rose 5p
to 455p.
Mr Redman said analysts would be wrong to infer anything from his remarks
other than he had decided to keep all options open. He explained, however,
that he was very unlikely to make another hostile bid since the price for
success could prove too expensive.
He described the Pounds 214.3n paid for JA Devenish, the west country pubs
group, by Greenalls, the UK pubs and hotels group, as 'high'.
The recent move outflanked rival pubs group, Boddington, which had been
considering another offer for Devenish after an unsuccessful Pounds 120m
hostile bid two years ago. Boddington accepted the cash offer for its 19.2
per cent stake it had acquired in Devenish.
Mr Redman said there was more logic in a link-up between Morland and Greene
King than in the Greenalls merger with Devenish.
There was a Pounds 2.6m extraordinary charge for underwriting costs and
professional fees for the failed Morland bid. Taxable profits were also
affected by lower property disposals following last year's property
revaluation. There was an exceptional loss of Pounds 80,000 compared to a
profit of Pounds 625,000.
The impact of the recession continues to adversely affect the pub trade. Mr
Redman said there were only small signs of improvement. During the year
Greene King IPA was given strong advertising support, which is planned to
increase over the next six months.

FT  09 JUL 93 / Euro Disney warns of summer loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EURO Disney yesterday warned that it would make a loss this summer and said
it had sought financial support from Walt Disney, its US parent company,
writes Alice Rawsthorn.
Mr Philippe Bourguignon, the chairman, said Euro Disney had decided to delay
the construction of the second phase of EuroDisneyland because of its
financial difficulties.
The group's share price fell sharply after the announcement and ended the
day down FFr870 at FFr5,950, their lowest level this year. In London, the
stock closed 108p lower at 675p.
Euro Disney, which opened the theme park in April 1992, originally hoped to
be profitable from the beginning.
But after a second-half deficit last year, it is heading for heavy losses in
the current financial year. It has already announced a net loss of FFr1.08bn
for the six months to March 31.
An unexpectedly high estimate of FFr500m losses in the third quarter formed
part of yesterday's warning. The company also said it would continue in the
red in the fourth quarter. The spring-summer half contains the theme park's
busiest period.
Euro Disney said it had been affected by the European recession and by the
French franc's strength against other currencies, notably the pound and the
lira. Trips from the UK fell considerably, with the number of visitors to
EuroDisneyland falling to 310,000 in the third quarter, a 50 per cent fall
on the same period last year. The decline in foreign attendance was
countered by an increase in the number of French visitors.
The group is reassessing its plans for the second phase of EuroDisneyland,
originally expected to include a second park and golf course. Mr Bourguignon
said the group had to be 'prudent for the short term'.
In the meantime Euro Disney is trying to restructure its debt in a
refinancing deal which could include raising new capital. The rise in its
net debt from FFr18.5bn to FFr21bn in the current financial year has raised
concern about the cashflow position.
Walt Disney, which owns 49 per cent of the equity, has agreed to help
finance working capital requirements until next spring when Euro Disney
hopes to have completed its refinancing.

FT  09 JUL 93 / BAe cuts risk of breaching covenants
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN and SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Aerospace reorganised its debt yesterday to reduce the risk of
breaching loan agreements with its banks and to increase flexibility in
managing its assets.
The company is replacing an Dollars 825m (Pounds 550m) loan, which falls due
in June next year, plus some other loans with a Pounds 1.4bn five-year
revolving credit facility. At the same time it has changed its main loan
covenant from one based on its net assets to one based on its interest cover
 -the number of times interest costs are covered by profits.
The old net worth covenant was Pounds 1.6bn and net assets are about Pounds
1.8bn. Under the new agreement, BAe is obliged to gradually increase its
interest cover from an actual rate of about one-and-a-half times now to a
covenant of about three times by 1996.
The change allows BAe to 'crystallise liabilities without breaching
covenants (with its banks)', said Mr Richard Lapthorne, finance director.
This means the company could sell assets below book value, making possible
the sale of, for instance, its carmaker Rover Group.
BAe is legally able to sell Rover next month - five years after buying it
from the government. BAe said it had no intention of selling the division
and yesterday included motor vehicles in a list of its core businesses.
Others were defence, commercial aircraft and aerostructures.
Mr Lapthorne said the arrangement 'has been tailored to the company's
five-year plan as presented to the banks'. Referring to the increased
borrowing limit of Pounds 1.4bn, he said this would reduce the company's
reliance on any one of its bankers.
He said there would be a small increase in the cost of servicing the debt.
When the five-year Dollars 825m loan facility was set up, loan margins were
relatively low, making it attractive for borrowers to raise financing in the
syndicated loan market. The margin was 10 basis points over London interbank
offered rate (Libor).
Since then, the cost of borrowing has risen. The new credit facility has a
margin over Libor of 62.5 basis points on the first third of the loan,
rising to a maximum of 87.5 basis points over Libor. Bank commitment fees on
the new loan range from 10 basis points to 25 basis points.
The syndicated facility is being arranged by Barclays Syndications, Lloyds
Bank Capital Markets Group, Midland Bank and NatWest Capital Markets.

FT  09 JUL 93 / Amstrad to close Spanish arm
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AMSTRAD, the UK-based consumer electronics group run by Mr Alan Sugar, is
closing its Spanish subsidiary and is expected to post a substantial full
year pre-tax loss as a result.
Under the new FRS 3 accounting rules, Amstrad will be forced to take a
Pounds 25m exceptional charge against its full year profits to cover the
goodwill written-off to reserves at the time of the Spanish subsidiary's
acquisition in September 1987.
The charge is expected to swamp any operating profits but will have no
effect on shareholders funds or cash flow. Amstrad's already depressed stock
closed down  1/2 p at 32p after the announcement.
Amstrad acquired its troubled Spanish distribution subsidiary, previously
called Indescomp, from Mr Jose Luis Dominguez Morales who had built the
business up riding the boom in personal computer sales in Spain over the
previous three years.
In its heyday the subsidiary, renamed Amstrad Espana, had personal computer
sales of more than Pounds 100m and was one of Amstrad's largest operations
outside the UK employing 250 people.
However, 1987/88 was its peak year and the subsidiary has lost money ever
since as personal computer prices tumbled in the face of growing
competition.
The closure of the Spanish operations were foreshadowed in February at the
time of Amstrad's interim results when the group took nearly Pounds 12m of
restructuring charges to cover stock write downs, the costs of Mr Sugar's
failed buy-back bid, and the costs of re-organising the Spanish subsidiary.
Amstrad Espana's operations had already been significantly scaled-back over
the past 12 months with its workforce dropping from 40 to just 12. In the
end Mr Tony Dean, group finance director, said Amstrad decided it would be
cheaper to support its products in the Spanish market through an independent
distributor and close the subsidiary.
Yesterday Amstrad, which has suffered a series of setbacks in recent years
as competition has intensified and the group has appeared to run out of
'blockbuster' products, said it has successfully concluded negotiations with
an independent distributor.

FT  09 JUL 93 / Empty pockets hit imported dream / Explaining what has gone
wrong with the Euro wonderland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN and MICHAEL SKAPINKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One of the cinema commercials running in Paris this summer features Zorro,
the black-clad knight, who gallops on his trusty steed through the
EuroDisneyland theme park to slip a crystal slipper on to Cinderella's
dainty foot.
The commercial is part of a promotion aimed at encouraging Parisians to
visit the theme park in the evening. But there is an element of wishful
thinking in the script for Euro Disney, which is in deep financial
difficulty and desperately needs a Zorro.
The group, which lost FFr1.08bn (Dollars 180m) in the winter half-year,
yesterday warned that it was still losing money in the summer months. Ms
Rebecca Winnington-Ingram, European leisure analyst at Morgan Stanley, now
forecasts a net loss of FFr1.9bn for the year to September 30 and a FFr1.1bn
loss for next year. 'The only solution is to find further external finance.'
The chief cause of Euro Disney's operational difficulties is the recession.
The number of people visiting the park in the April-June quarter was 3.1m,
roughly the same as in that quarter in 1992. This figure was slightly below
expectations, given that the park did not open until April 12 last year, but
not seriously so.
However the apparently stable figure of 3.1m disguises a steep decline in
foreign attendance. The number of British visitors fell by 50 per cent to
310,000 this spring, with Italian visitors down by 25 per cent to 93,000.
Travel companies attributed the fall to the devaluation of the pound and the
lira against the French franc after the September currency crisis, which has
triggered an overall decline in bookings to France.
Euro Disney has managed to compensate for the fall in foreign attendance by
attracting more French visitors. The number of domestic trippers rose to
1.5m this spring, 50 per cent up on the previous year. But many were given
discounts, thereby reducing ticket revenue.
French visitors are also less likely to spend heavily on food and drink in
the park, or to stay in Euro Disney hotels. This, combined with a new
strategy of offering cheaper souvenirs and food at the park, depressed
revenue from merchandise sales and catering. Spending by guests at the
hotels also fell, despite a 10 per cent increase in occupancy levels to 68.5
per cent.
The company blames these operational problems on the temporary pressures of
recession. It argues they should recede when the European economy recovers.
The new management team, headed by Mr Philippe Bourguignon, who took over as
chairman last autumn, admits that the original concept for the park was too
close to Disney's US parks to suit European taste. The subsequent changes in
merchandising, catering, hotel pricing and marketing have been designed to
address this. But it will be difficult for Euro Disney to assess the impact
until the recession ends.
In the meantime the chief concern is the company's finances. Euro Disney's
operational difficulties last year were aggravated by high French interest
rates, which raised its interest bill by FFr200m above budget.
The recent falls in French rates have helped, but the level of net debt  -
at about FFr21bn - is far higher than expected. This is due partly to the
revenue squeeze and partly to a shortfall in anticipated capital gains - the
weak Paris property market has forced Euro Disney to delay its property
development plans.
Since the start of this year the company has been trying to renegotiate the
terms of its debt repayments and leasing arrangements.
The negotiations have been complicated by the deterioration in Euro Disney's
financial position. Analysts now suspect that the company not only needs to
revise the terms of its present financial arrangements, but also to raise
additional capital, either from the banks or from Walt Disney. The US parent
has agreed to provide financial support for until next spring, when the
refinancing is expected to be completed.
In the meantime Euro Disney has put the second phase on ice while it
'reassesses' the project. This decision clearly makes short-term sense, as
the company cannot afford expensive expansion. But the second phase was
expected not only to provide additional revenue, but extra business for the
hotels. A lengthy delay may mean that Euro Disney takes even longer to
struggle back into profit.

FT  09 JUL 93 / Concern over French recession puts franc under pressure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE FRENCH franc came under heavy selling pressure inside the European
exchange rate mechanism yesterday amid growing concern about the depth of
the French recession and renewed investor confidence in the D-Mark.
The franc fell sharply against the German currency, dropping nearly 2
centimes at one stage, after the country's official statistics agency issued
a gloomy forecast for French economic growth this year. It finished the day
in London at FFr3.395 against the D-Mark, but slipped further in late
trading in New York to FFr3.3979.
The Bank of France did not intervene in the foreign exchange markets to
support the currency. But dealers said that France's membership of the ERM
was undermining its ability to bring interest rates down to levels that
would stimulate an economic recovery. Some analysts said that, as a result
of this, the currency was on the verge of more turbulence in the ERM.
The trigger for yesterday's selling of the French currency was a report from
Insee, the official statistics agency, which forecast that gross domestic
product would fall by 0.7 per cent this year and that the unemployment rate
would rise from 11.5 per cent to 12.5 per cent by December.
These were gloomier than government predictions earlier this month which
forecast a 0.4 per cent contraction in GDP in 1993.
At the same time, French political leaders appeared to voice concern that
the country could not lower interest rates to stimulate an economic recovery
because of the country's membership of the ERM and the need to shadow German
monetary policy.
Market analysts also said that the franc had been unsettled by comments by
Mr Alain Juppe, the French foreign minister. Mr Juppe, attending the summit
of the G7 industrialised nations, said yesterday that France and Germany
'can go further in lowering interest rates'.
France has been able to push its money market rates more than  1/2 a
percentage point below German levels in recent months. But the Bank of
France's cut in interest rates last week, immediately after the Bundesbank
eased monetary policy, was deemed too hasty by some investors.

FT  09 JUL 93 / UK rejects Dublin idea on Ulster sovereignty
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH and Irish ministers clashed over the future of Northern Ireland last
night after the Irish government incensed unionist leaders by floating the
idea of joint UK-Irish sovereignty of the province.
In a scarcely disguised rebuke, Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland
secretary, said he had been 'surprised' by comments by Mr Dick Spring, the
Irish foreign minister.
Speaking after a meeting of the Anglo-Irish conference, Sir Patrick said Mr
Spring had apparently gone beyond the 'cardinal principle' that the
constitutional future of Northern Ireland would have to be agreed by the
province's population and political leaders.
But Mr Spring said that it would be wrong for any option for Northern
Ireland to be ruled out: 'If we are not allowed to put forward provocative
ideas then we may as well all give up.'
Irish officials said privately that the two governments had to be prepared
for the possible failure of 'round-table' talks on the province. Mr Spring
said that 'ultimately, responsibility lies with governments and I think that
the governments have to make that quite clear'.
The row reflected growing frustration in London and Dublin at the failure of
the two governments to restart the talks involving Northern Ireland's main
political leaders, which collapsed last November. Unionists say they will
not re-enter until the Irish Republic modifies its constitutional claim on
the north.
Although his row with Mr Spring lowered still further the chances of talks
resuming, Sir Patrick again refused to give up yesterday, saying: 'I don't
visualise this process failing.'
However, Mr Spring, while still commited to 'round-table' talks, has raised
the possibility of the two governments going over the heads of local
politicians and agreeing a political framework for the province, which might
be put to referendums in Northern Ireland and the south. He said options
could include shared authority or sovereignty of the province - both under
consideration by the UK Labour party.
But Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, and Sir Patrick have rejected such
proposals.

FT  09 JUL 93 / German spending cuts 'dash hopes of upturn': Economic
institute attacks budget savings package
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE German government's budget proposals have killed any hope of an economic
upturn next year, and left the Bundesbank little room for interest rate
reductions, according to the influential German Institute for Economic
Research (DIW).
In a scathing attack, the Berlin institute warned in its latest report that
Bonn's economic and finance policies would lead to nil economic growth in
1994, compared with consensus forecasts of 1 per cent GDP growth.
The report was released as the German stock market surged to a year's high
yesterday.
The DIW is one of the five leading independent economic institutes in
western Germany, and was one of the first to warn of the dangers of
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's decision to press ahead with early monetary union
with the former East Germany.
Its report also poured cold water on optimism within the government and the
Bundesbank that recovery will start at the end of this year and heaped scorn
on claims that the economy is imperilled by structural crisis.
Prof Lutz Hoffmann, DIW president, yesterday denounced the government's
finance policy as 'short-term juggling'. He said suggestions that structural
problems could be solved by people working longer hours - strongly backed by
Mr Kohl - were 'tomfoolery of the first order'.
The institute, which based its forecast on the assumption of early and
'radical' cuts in European short-term interest rates, claimed that, due in
part to planned increases in fuel taxes, west German inflation would average
3.5 per cent next year. 'This does not suggest. . . there will be great
scope for interest rate cuts.'
While the government was counting on a DM35bn (Pounds 13.7bn) improvement in
its revenues next year 'four fifths of these measures directly reduce
incomes, one fifth increases prices'.
Bonn's savings, dependent on benefit cuts, would lead to a real fall in
private disposable incomes of 2 per cent next year and a drop of 1.5 per
cent in private consumption, it claimed.
Reducing unemployment benefits and payments to the poorest divided the
community.
Publication of the report coincided with corrections to recent monetary
indicators which showed money supply growth and inflation exceeding earlier
estimates. Annualised growth in the M3 measure of money supply in May was
6.9 per cent, not 6.7 per cent, the Bundesbank said. The figure for western
German inflation in June was also revised up from 4.1 per cent to 4.2 per
cent, unchanged.

FT  09 JUL 93 / Contractors offer big savings to councils
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMPANIES providing services for councils under compulsory competitive
tendering are cutting their prices when the contracts are renewed, according
to figures published today in the Local Government Chronicle.
The figures contradict the common view that the companies which won
contracts on the first round had treated the exercise as a 'loss-leader'.
Eight of the first nine authorities to renegotiate contracts for refuse
collection since the scheme started in 1988 have achieved real-term price
cuts of 18.4 per cent or more.
Councils using private contractors obtained savings varying from a 30 per
cent real reduction for Runnymede district council to 18.4 per cent for
Tonbridge.
Medina district council, in the Isle of Wight, is the only authority so far
to have suffered an increase.
Three contractors - Biffa Waste, Tylers, and Cory Environmental - have so
far won contracts. Only in Cherwell, in Oxfordshire, has the council's own
direct labour force kept the contract, by accepting a reduction in price
from Pounds 1.2m in 1988 to Pounds 840,000 this year.
Direct labour organisations, which in most cases beat private sector
competitors when the contracts were first put out to tender, found the
figures alarming.
Mr Mark Bramah, principal adviser to the Association of Direct Labour
Organisations, said previous studies had suggested contract prices would
rise when retendered. He said: 'I find it surprising that they are coming in
cheaper. There may be underlying reasons in each case, such as the impact of
the recession on private sector bids. Local authorities' own resource
problems could also be affecting their specifications.'
Mr Cliff Davis-Coleman, managing director of CD-C Research, which produced
the figures, estimated that further contracts to be awarded in the next two
months would confirm that private companies were prepared to offer low
prices in order to gain substantial volume in the UK market.

FT  09 JUL 93 / The Lex Column: Owners Abroad
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The City's collective memory yesterday strained to recall an occasion when a
company had suffered such a rapid reversal of fortune as Owners Abroad so
soon after fighting off a hostile bid. Just four months after rejecting
Airtours' offer of 150p, Owners has warned that this year's profits may be
half the market's expectations. The one-third fall in Owners' share price to
66p expressed the scale of disappointment.
During the bid, Owners did not issue a formal profits forecast but made much
of its claim that trading was at record levels. Even considering the
industry's notorious volatility, the suddenness of the transformation is
astonishing.
The Takeover Panel should force Owners, and its financial adviser, Samuel
Montagu, to justify the statements made during the bid period. The
resignation of Owners' chief executive is scant consolation for Airtours
which wasted Pounds 9m on its bid.

German interest rates. Ever since Germany called off bilateral discussion of
monetary policy two weeks ago, that hope was looking hollow. This week's
economic data has reinforced the perception that the French recession is
getting worse while that of Germany has bottomed out. So it is not
surprising that the franc is suddenly weak again. Against a backdrop of
rising unemployment, France cannot possibly raise interest rates to defend
its currency. It must hope that German cuts will be sufficient and rapid
enough to prevent the franc sinking to its floor.
Judging by its previous behaviour, the Bundesbank will now seek to deliver
just enough relief. The rally in both the German equity and bond markets
suggest expectation of some acceleration in the pace of cuts. The strength
of the D-mark may make this easier: it has regained something of its safe
haven status, fuelled admittedly by premature expectations that the German
constitutional court will rule against the Maastricht treaty. But the
Bundesbank may also find it hard to ignore yesterday's upward revision in
both the latest money supply and inflation figures.
It may be tempted to make a basically cosmetic gesture before its summer
recess, such as a cut in the now scarcely relevant Lombard rate or a
slightly stronger downward push to money market rates. By fuelling
expectations of further cuts, similar moves have calmed exchange markets
before. But France needs a large fall in interest rates - probably to 5 per
cent or lower - to secure the recovery that its businessmen and voters want.
As long as that is not in sight, its long-term ability to stay the ERM
course remains in question.

British Aerospace's refinancing of its banking arrangements is a predictable
surprise. The net worth ceiling of the old facilities was a well-known
constraint on the management's capacity to shuffle its assets. BAe has
enough headroom to provide against its aircraft leases in this year's
figures, but insufficient to provide for putting its Jetstream aircraft
business into a joint venture. That constraint will be gone once the
changeover is complete in six or nine months.
The new arrangement usefully lengthens the life of BAe's banking lines, and
allows managers to focus on issues such as cash flow as well as net worth.
The ratchet up of the interest cover and gearing covenants also illustrates
the banks' faith in a profits recovery over the next few years, while the
facility is even large enough for BAe to be able to lose a few syndicate
members along the way without causing it any problems.
Still, when a company buys itself elbow room, one wonders what it will do
with it. Jetstream is almost certainly heading into a joint venture, but
Rover will probably stay. Given the effort BAe has put into the company, and
the poor state of the car industry, it will want to run Rover for profits.
Property looks fairly valued, so further write-downs are unlikely. If the
Matra missile deal is eventually struck, there may be some rationalisation
costs, but that is not yet in the bag. Indeed, the sub-plot of the abortive
GEC talks may have been pressure from Lord Weinstock for a BAe/GEC missile
deal instead of a BAe/Matra joint venture. However, more wholesale surgery
on the BAe balance sheet seems improbable. While the formal constraint has
gone, the company hardly has net worth to burn.

The summer should be a happy time for Euro Disney. But the dismal start to
what should be its peak season raises questions over whether the project was
fundamentally misconceived. The issue cannot be ignored even though its US
parent has agreed to tide the project over until next spring. That should
give time to work out the best way to take the scheme forward and
restructure its finances. Whatever solution is devised, though, is unlikely
to hold much appeal for Euro Disney's 200,000 ordinary shareholders.
For Walt Disney, the longer term question will be whether to resurrect plans
to build the second stage of the project at a cost of some FFr8bn. Without a
second park, Euro Disney could never defray the substantial development
costs of the first phase. The difficulties of financing the scheme through
further equity issues may eventually prompt Walt Disney to try to buy out
the 51 per cent of the shares it does not already own. But its own
shareholders might then complain their company was simply throwing good
money after bad. There is no guarantee that a larger park will fill Euro
Disney's under-occupied hotels.
Euro Disney may draw some comfort from its visitor numbers, which have shown
reasonable progress in hostile conditions. Particular difficulties
undoubtedly apply. The French economy is slipping fast. Property sales have
been stymied. Local visitors are not as inclined to splash out on hamburgers
and hotel rooms as foreign tourists. They, though, have been deterred by the
strong franc. Euro Disney's travails also stimulate broader worries. They
are hardly the best advertisement for the joys of owning shares just as the
French government tries to offload rather a lot of them.

<TEXT>
AFTER SEVEN or eight years of argument, another decision point is
approaching in the controversy over the disclosure of life assurance
commissions. The Treasury, now the responsible government department, is
preparing its reply to the Office of Fair Trading's latest proposals to rock
the life industry's boat.
In preparation, the Securities and Investments Board is setting up a special
taskforce that will seek to draw up a disclosure regime to square all the
circles.
The OFT's recommendations in March included the compulsory 'hard' disclosure
in cash, at an early stage in the selling process, of the commissions earned
by independent financial advisers.
Recently the Securities and Investments Board joined with the two junior
retail investment regulatory bodies, Fimbra and Lautro (which may soon be
combined within the new Personal Investment Authority), to produce a joint
submission to the Treasury. Although this has not been published, it is
known that it argues against hard disclosure, at least in so far as a
harsher regime might be applied to IFAs alone.
Yesterday the SIB chairman, Mr Andrew Large, said that he hoped the life
industry would at last be able to escape from what he called a regulatory
Bermuda Triangle, with the disclosure issue bouncing around repeatedly
between the SIB, the OFT and the Treasury. With a call for 'one last push',
he is setting up a taskforce of regulators to devise a permanent solution.
The danger is that this will prove to be yet another vain search for an
unattainable consensus. Mr Large appears to be relying, first, on a
perception of fatigue within the life industry which might make companies
and intermediaries less resistant to hard disclosure and, second, on a
greater emphasis on the need for a level playing field for both IFAs and
salesmen.
The OFT took a purist view, arguing that IFAs hold themselves out to be
giving independent advice, and therefore they must be ready to disclose the
cost of that advice to their client. Salesmen acting for only one company
are not required to disclose in the same way, however.
If the Treasury comes to the decision that the OFT is right on this issue,
SIB apparently will attempt to devise a solution that will be harsher for
salesmen too, but will retain the competitive balance between the two
distribution channels. It remains to be seen what the direct-selling life
offices will think of this approach, although it is possible to guess.
Regardless of such details, the Treasury should come to its decision on the
broadest view, that transparency at all levels is needed if the market is to
be balanced in favour of the client. The life industry has for too many
years exploited poor disclosure standards in order to promote extravagantly
expensive distribution channels and dominate the retail investment industry.
The particular issue of commission disclosure by IFAs should not be allowed
to delay progress towards better disclosure whatever the type of sales
intermediary.
The root of the problem of IFAs lies in the rigid polarisation rules. If the
Treasury backs the OFT, the right response would be to devise a system of
multi-company ties for those IFAs fearful of the effect of hard disclosure
on this business. But the life industry has yet to demonstrate that it has
the necessary flexibility to respond to the public interest. Mr Large may
discover that one last push will not be enough.

While John Birt's shake-up at the BBC has terminated a few careers, it looks
to be good news for Kevin Lygo, son of former British Aerospace chairman
Admiral Sir Raymond Lygo.
Young Lygo, an executive producer with the Beeb, already has the job of
winning higher ratings by developing popular new shows, and the word is that
he may well be tapped to take over as head of light entertainment following
this week's departure of Jim Moir. The latter has been promoted to deputy
director of corporate affairs for the corporation, which more cynical BBC
watchers regard as genuine light entertainment.
Given the BBC's recent dismal performance in the ratings game, a lot will be
required of the new head of light entertainment. Kevin won plaudits for his
recent Comic Relief programme . . . and being a good mate of BBC1 controller
Alan Yentob always helps.

At a time when The New Statesman is once again hogging the limelight with
its publicity-seeking gimmicks, it is good to see a fresh crew climb aboard
Tribune, the other left-of-centre weekly.
Labour MP Peter Hain, despite his once-rebellious past, is the least
exciting of the new faces. He is a longstanding Tribune member and takes
over as board chairman.
However, new editor Mark Seddon, who is a Westminster lobbyist, and Bill
Hagerty, the former editor of The People, the down-market Sunday paper,
could make an interesting combination. Hagerty, who lost his job last
November, says his new post of consultant editor is ideal. He wanted a
day-time interest to combine with his night-time activity as theatre critic
for Today newspaper.
And in case the new team run short of ideas, they can always turn to Michael
Foot, the former leader of the opposition and former Tribune editor, who
shares an office with Tribune. When not working on his biography of HG
Wells, he still fires off the occasional Tribune leader on Bosnia. Shouldn't
be too difficult to give the 'staggers' a run for its money.

Welsh Development Agency only a week before yesterday's blistering attack on
the agency's management style by the Commons public accounts committee, no
doubt hopes that all is behind him as he returns full-time to his other

In one important respect, however, Jones, who is a non-executive director of
Tesco, is not yet shot of his public sector responsibilities, having been
installed as the BBC's national governor for Wales at the beginning of last
year.
The MPs tartly note that some of his public and private appointments 'may
well have resulted from his chairmanship of the WDA'. Hence the odd awkward
question as to whether someone whose management team 'presided over a
catalogue of serious and inexcusable breaches of expected standards of
control and accountability' is best qualified to do the BBC job which runs
until the end of 1996.

The punctilious Swiss look to have dealt a blow to the grand old advertising
dodge of the Unique Selling Point.
The whole point about a USP, of course, is that the advertised feature
itself is not unique - indeed it may well be shared by every competing
product on the market. All that's unique is that your company is the first
to highlight the standard feature and shout about it.
But better beware pinning your hopes on the dodge in Switzerland, as Grand
Metropolitan's trendy American ice-cream vendor, Haagen-Dazs, has found in
trying to follow McDonald's into the fastidious indigenous food market.
It took the hamburger chain a two-year struggle with the local authorities
to break into the posh resort of Zermatt. And the Swiss are now giving no
less icy a reception to Haagen-Dazs, with particular emphasis on its tactic
of marketing its products on the claim that they contain no preservatives.
While that might do everywhere else, Swiss health officials say, it doesn't
do in the country of perfection. There everyone who makes ice cream is
obliged to keep it free of preservatives and the interloper may not make
mention of doing likewise in either advertising or packaging.
Undaunted, the company has promised to remove the offending claim from its
packaging. As for advertising, it claims to have no plans to recycle the
erotic campaigns which went down so well in Britain. Sensible decision. If
it had done so, it would undoubtedly have run foul of some Swiss official or
other.

FT  09 JUL 93 / Underweight and over here: UK bonds and equities are
attractive foreign targets for US institutional investors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN PLENDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
US investment institutions have been notoriously shy of investing in
overseas securities. But with Wall Street putting a value on US corporate
earnings and assets higher than that prevailing before the 1929 crash, there
are signs that the rest of the world risks catching the fever as US fund
managers see attractions in cheaper overseas markets. Indeed, there is a
hint of a parallel with the Japanese speculative bubble in the late 1980s.
While the monetary symptoms are different, an important shift in asset
allocation is under way and the impact is no less significant for third
parties - not least the UK, which has almost certainly been the biggest
recent beneficiary of the outward flow of funds. Meanwhile, a wider process
of international diversification gathers pace, raising questions about how
far differences in earnings multiples and dividend yields between individual
country markets might be ironed out.
First, the data. In 1992, US investors' net purchases of foreign bonds and
equities increased by 9.3 per cent to Dollars 51bn. On the crude statistics
from the US Treasury, nearly all of the Dollars 19bn earmarked for foreign
bonds in 1992 went into the UK, while the UK displaced Japan last year as
the biggest repository for US equity investors' money, accounting for
Dollars 11.3bn of a Dollars 32bn total outflow. That Dollars 11.3bn compares
with net purchases of equities by UK life funds and pension funds in 1992 of
Dollars 4.4bn out of a total cash flow of Dollars 35.7bn.
In practice, the UK share is probably overstated, in that it almost
certainly includes some funds that ultimately find their way into
continental Europe. But Dollars 4.9bn is said to have been invested in the
UK equity market in the final quarter of last year alone, after the
September devaluation added to the attraction of sterling and equities. This
compares with Dollars 4.4bn that found its way to Japan in the whole of
1992; so the broad thesis that the London market has been grabbing the
lion's share looks plausible.
At the same time the flow of portfolio investment from the US into foreign
markets in the first quarter of 1993 has accelerated sharply. According to
UBS Global Research, a record Dollars 26.6bn went into foreign bonds and
equities, compared with Dollars 17.4bn in the previous quarter. But, within
those totals, the UK's share of the equity outflow fell from Dollars 4.9bn
to Dollars 1.4bn. That turnround clearly helps explain the sideways movement
of UK equities this year.
The balance of international portfolio diversification is inevitably unequal
because the US and Japan, which respectively accounted for 38.7 per cent and
30.8 per cent of the FT-Actuaries World Index at June 30, are elephants in
the rowing-boat: while inflows from the rest of the world cannot impact
greatly on these two countries' domestic markets, changes in asset
allocation that are small for the US and Japan can cause huge upheavals in
the large number of countries that make up the remaining 30.5 per cent. Put
another way, last year's Dollars 51bn US outflow was equivalent to less than
three months' cash flow of the mutual fund industry alone.
US insurers and pension funds hold only 4-5 per cent of their assets in
foreign securities. But there is a growing awareness of the theoretical
benefits of diversification, which increases returns for a given degree of
risk; and, as Andrew Garthwaite of SG Warburg Securities points out, most
risk analysis models in the US suggest the figure should be nearer 15 per
cent.
The incentive to raise the portfolio percentage overseas has been reinforced
by the beneficial impact of prolonged dollar weakness on the performance of
institutions with above-average foreign holdings. The fact that the US
equity market remains obdurately overvalued, and that private investors
continue to pour money into mutual funds, makes higher-yielding markets in
Britain and France look all the more tempting.
Increasing integration in world capital markets should be economically
beneficial in that it encourages capital to flow more efficiently into
investment that promises a high return. Yet in practice the flows are oddly
distributed. The UK market, for example, offers less in the way of
diversification benefits than any other European market because of the UK
corporate sector's disproportionately large direct investment in the United
States. Yet it hogs a disproportionate share of international money. The
emerging markets in developing countries offer the biggest diversification
benefits, because of their low correlation with international market
movements: they do not move in step with the fund manager's domestic market.
Yet the World Bank calculates that they account for less than a quarter of a
per cent of worldwide institutional assets.
This highlights the fact that institutional money tends to go to the most
liquid markets, rather than to those that offer the highest degree of
diversification. And it raises a question about how far integration can go.
In theory the scope is immense. The World Bank estimates, for example, that
global institutional investment funds are worth Dollars 14,000bn. If the
fund managers were to make a modest genuflection to modern portfolio theory
and put just 10 per cent into foreign securities, the impact on markets
would be considerable.
Yet even in the US the constraints on foreign investment are not to be
under-estimated. While private sector pension funds enjoy considerable
freedom, state pension funds, whose cash flow is still growing strongly,
often have restrictions on overseas investment. For US insurers, state rules
are often prohibitive. Even where they are being relaxed, as in New York
State where the ceiling on foreign investments was lifted from 3 per cent to
6 per cent in 1990, insurers are still prevented from obeying the full logic
of risk analysis.
In Japan, fund managers formally enjoy sufficient discretion to diversify
their portfolios significantly. But in practice official guidance still
plays an important part in determining the flow of funds. In continental
Europe, there are heavy restraints on cross-border investments, as well as
explicit requirements in some countries to invest a given portfolio
percentage in government bonds. This means that capital market integration
is more of a one-way street; and now the process has in effect been frozen,
after a decision to put a liberalising European Community pensions directive
on the Brussels back burner last month.
As for the developing countries, their capital markets suffer from lack of
liquidity, poor information and regulatory restraints on foreign capital.
Yet many are beginning to recognise that portfolio inflows reduce the cost
of capital for domestic companies. One spectacular result of this change in
attitude can be seen in Latin America, where gross equity portfolio inflows
have gone from Dollars 434m in 1989 to Dollars 5.6bn in 1992. International
bond issues have performed in similarly dramatic fashion. Repatriated flight
capital has played a part, as have high-risk, high-return funds. But foreign
insurers and pension funds have so far been insignificant contributors.
At first sight, a reduction in the cost of capital in the recipient country
looks an attractive gain from capital market liberalisation. So, too, does
the idea that these flows represent more stable long-term finance for budget
deficits and the balance of payments. On this ground alone, the UK might be
thankful that US institutions are a little less underweight,
internationally, and over here. Yet there is scant evidence that US
institutions are building up core holdings in European markets, establishing
big foreign companies as permanent features in the portfolio. And there is
plenty of anecdotal evidence that cross-border institutional investment is
just hot money in another guise - witness the role of pension funds in the
currency turmoil in Europe last September.
Certainly British institutions take a shorter-term view of foreign markets
and generate a far higher level of turnover and activity in overseas
securities than at home. All of which points to a greater degree of
volatility as world markets integrate further.

FT  09 JUL 93 / Personal View: EC merger control - no soft touch
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLAUS-DIETER EHLERMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A few months away from its third birthday, the first stage of the European
Community's system of merger control has come to an end. So too, perhaps,
has its honeymoon period as recent comment in this paper and others has
shown.
This response is nevertheless useful and welcome at a time when the
Commission and in particular its competition minister, Karel Van Miert, is
preparing a review of some specific issues, such as whether the turnover
thresholds determining jurisdiction are set at the right level to capture
most mergers with a cross-border, Community interest.
To put some of the recent criticism into perspective, there are some obvious
points which need to be made. For example, the Commission's practice on
mergers cases is unique among competition agencies in that all cases falling
under the merger regulation are the subject of a reasoned decision which is
published. This unique level of openness in decision-making does, however,
lead to an equally unique degree of exposure to comment.
The most important concerns relate to the level of transparency in
decision-making and its susceptibility to lobbying; a perceived need for a
separation of the powers of investigation and decision; a failure to adopt a
more quantitative approach to economic analysis; and the alleged narrowness
of the market definitions adopted.
Taking the last of these first, it is true that the Commission had indeed
been rigorous and conservative in defining the markets affected by a merger,
particularly where national and regional differences may still be crucial.
But in its subsequent assessment of the market power of the undertakings
concerned, it has incorporated wider considerations of potential
competition, imperfect substitution of products or the supply
characteristics of a market. The Commission is also not closed to a use of
econometric methods and quantitative tests, especially in market definition.
None the less, they can never be a determinant since some aspects of a
competitive situation will always resist quantification.
Calls for greater transparency have focused on the idea of separating the
responsibility for investigation of mergers from the power of negotiation
and decision. This proposal, most frequently expressed as a call for an
independent European cartel office, has to be assessed carefully on its
merits. The fact that such an office could adopt conclusions based on an
independent competition investigation does not settle the question as to the
criteria upon which merger would ultimately be authorised or prohibited, nor
the thorny issue of which body would have the task of doing so (the
Commission, the Council?). A European cartel office would also, like the
Commission, have to be made up of representatives of all member states.
Until there is greater convergence on the scope, objectives and methodology
of competition policy, the work of any competition agency at European level
will inevitably lead to some controversy. Such issues would have to be
looked at before any changes were proposed to EC treaties and institutions.
Meanwhile, the existing merger regulation must be regarded as something of
an achievement in that it has identified grounds - strictly competition
issues - on which the Commission is empowered to act with respect to mergers
of a Community dimension. A lot can also be done to reduce the general
concern about the objectivity of investigations and decisions if there is
greater transparency in procedures and working methods.
Moves to increase transparency would need to be balanced against the risk
that they could impose a fresh procedural burden, particularly on
unproblematic cases. The Commission is examining possible improvements to
see whether they require amendments to the Council regulation or can be made
with a more flexible interpretation of the existing provisions.
The Commission has received plaudits from businesses for the speed,
flexibility and business-minded approach of its Merger Task Force. But it
would be wrong to see this as a sign that the Commission is a 'soft touch'
for companies.
The MTF listens to what they say and tries to avoid unnecessary delay. But
it nevertheless is firm in its dealings with the parties and carries out
consultations of competitors, customers and other third parties. It has
imposed conditions on companies in 15 cases to date and blocked one
transaction outright. Groups such as Nestle, De Havilland, Fiat and Alcatel
which have been involved in these cases would not describe the Commission as
easily dissuaded from its task.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MISDEMEANOURS at the Welsh Development Agency revealed by a Commons
committee yesterday provide a curious illustration of how not to import the
culture of the private sector into public service. In terms of its
commercial objectives, the WDA has been remarkably successful. With a mere 5
per cent of the UK population, Wales has in recent years grabbed 20 per cent
of the UK's inward investment. Last year, against the general trend, foreign
investment in Wales was higher than the year before. This was at least
partly due to energetic selling and marketing along private sector lines;
and in the context of a public company, some at least of the goings-on
indulged in by WDA officials would scarcely raise an eyebrow.
But the taxpayer demands, and is plainly entitled to, different standards.
Public officials are not supposed to travel by Concorde, award themselves
free petrol or conduct interviews with model girls in hotel rooms. The
danger now is that the pendulum will swing the other way. The last Welsh
secretary, Mr David Hunt, attributed much of Wales's success in attracting
investment to close co-operation between the WDA and the Welsh Office, and
indeed to active joint selling by himself and the WDA's now retired
chairman. It would be scarcely surprising if the entrepreneurial instincts
of the new secretary, Mr John Redwood, were tempered by yesterday's
revelations. In the context of a marketing effort, which last year attracted
investment of Pounds 950m and is claimed to have created over 13,000 jobs,
that would be rather a pity.

FT  09 JUL 93 / Leading Article: Strong words, weak action
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IN TOKYO, the world's leaders huff and puff. They reaffirm their commitment
to 'the territorial integrity of Bosnia-Herzegovina' - an integrity which,
if it ever existed, has long since been trampled underfoot. They 'cannot
agree' to a solution dictated by Serbs and Croats - neither of whom shows
any sign of caring whether they agree or not.
The G7 countries commit themselves to implement the Security Council
resolution on safe areas for the Moslems, 'by sending troops, by air
protection of the Unprofor, by financial and logistical contributions or by
appropriate diplomatic action'. The operative word here is 'or'. No one
should suppose that either Chancellor Kohl or President Clinton has
committed himself to send troops, or that Mr Miyazawa has undertaken to send
Japanese aircraft. The other leaders do perhaps intend to send more troops,
but are not saying how many.
Meanwhile, in Belgrade, President Slobodan Milosevic has cast aside the mask
of moderation, openly expressing his contempt for world opinion; and in
Sarajevo the World Health Organisation warns that the remaining hospital
services are on the brink of collapse.
The disparity between the rhetoric of world leadership and the reality of
local barbarism is glaring. In 1991 the western powers showed they were able
to reverse a clear case of aggression by one state against another. In the
former Yugoslavia they have shown equally clearly that they are unable, or
if able are unwilling, to deal with aggression and atrocity when
perpetrators and victims are not separated by a clear international border.
The partition of Bosnia into three zones - in itself a serious defeat for
the principles on which the post cold war European order was supposed to be
based - has now become the nearest approximation to a fair outcome that one
can imagine. But even that rough justice will not be attained unless
external powers are prepared to commit significantly larger forces than they
have done so far, using them to help the Moslems secure a viable zone
roughly commensurate with their numbers - and, presumably, to 'cleanse' it
of those Serb and Croat residents who are unwilling to live under Moslem
rule.
That unpleasant obligation, which wiser and bolder policies at an earlier
stage might have avoided, must not now be shirked. But the 'international
community' (as it likes to call itself) need not and should not think only
in terms of military options. Since the Croats are now officially recognised
as partners in crime with the Serbs, they too must be subjected to
sanctions. The moral effect in their case might well be greater, since
President Tudjman has made much of his country's 'European' vocation, its
supposedly superior civilisation, and its recognition by the world at large.
Alas, the truth is that he has tolerated significantly less freedom of
expression internally than has Mr Milosevic.
Much more could be done to help free and objective media in all the
ex-Yugoslav republics, such as the newspaper Feral Tribune recently started
by a group of Croat journalists, and now hanging by a shoestring, or the
courageous B92 radio station in Serbia. A ship that was broadcasting
objective news to all the ex-Yugoslav republics from offshore in the
Adriatic has had to suspend operations because the country whose flag it was
flying withdrew permission and because of a Serbian complaint to the
International Broadcasting Union. The nations that are supposedly enforcing
sanctions in the Adriatic could surely offer it the protection of their
flags and the hospitality of their airwaves.

FT  09 JUL 93 / Letter: Portrayal of Einstein's teacher unfair
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr ROGER HIGHFIELD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Michael Dixon's example of a recruiter's nightmare (Jobs Column, July
7) - Heinrich Weber's rejection of Einstein - is rather unfair. I suspect
that, in Weber's shoes, most of us would have done the same.
From my research on a forthcoming biography of Einstein, I can say that
Weber's apparent folly is another example of the mythology that has obscured
the real story of the century's greatest scientist.
The reasons that Einstein became the only one of the four 1900 graduates
from Section VIA of the Swiss Federal Polytechnical School (now called the
ETH) not to secure an academic position are:
Einstein's cocky manners and his irregular attendance at classes had not
endeared him to the polytechnic staff. Weber, Einstein's physics lecturer,
had told him that his cleverness was marred by one great fault: 'You'll
never let yourself be told anything.' Einstein retaliated by addressing him
as 'Herr Weber', instead of the formal 'Herr professor'.
The average grade of Einstein's final examinations for the teaching diploma
was 4.91. This was undistinguished, given that the marks of the others who
passed the exams ranged from 5.14 to 5.45.
Weber, an experimentalist, took on two mechanical engineers that year;
Einstein was a theoretician (much rarer at that time, and in less demand).
Michael Dixon can be forgiven for portraying Weber as the villain: Einstein
himself suspected that Weber had spread bad opinions of him. He grumbled
that he would have found a job 'had it not been for Weber's
underhandedness'.

FT  09 JUL 93 / Letter: More package holidaymakers covered by security
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From BARONESS DENTON Of Wakefield
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I was astonished to read the statement by Michael Skapinker ('Travel:
Hanging on to your holiday', July 3) that the EC Package Travel Directive
has proved useless. On the contrary, the Package Travel Regulations 1992
(which implement the directive in UK law), require for the first time that
all organisers of packages should have security for customer pre-payments in
the event of insolvency. As a result, more holidaymakers are covered by such
security than ever before. This is a big step forward in consumer
protection.
I do not understand why Michael Skapinker should say trading standards
officers have neither the time nor the experience to enforce the
regulations. Trading standards officers are highly trained experts who
enforce a very wide variety of consumer protection legislation, and I have
been impressed by the speed and thoroughness with which they have got to
grips with the requirements of the package travel regulations.
Nor would I agree that no one knows the legal definition of a package
holiday. Part of the definition of a package is that it must be prearranged.
This is sensible: a holiday whose elements are specified in detail by the
customer himself is not a package as we would normally understand it. As
with all legal definitions, there will be cases where there is room for
debate on which side of the line a particular holiday falls, but such cases
should be rare.
It is a requirement of the package travel regulations that organisers should
indicate both in any brochure they issue and in their contracts with
individual holidaymakers how they have chosen to meet the provisions of the
regulations regarding security in the event of insolvency. The customers are
thus readily able to check that their travel company is complying with the
regulations. Our aim in implementing the directive was to ensure that costs
were kept to a minimum and choice of holiday to a maximum.
It would be more helpful if, instead of writing off the extended protection,
your correspondent advised holidaymakers to ensure that they check that they
are dealing with a company offering security. We have given them the means
to do so.

FT  09 JUL 93 / Down-to-earth member of the club: Two of a kind -
Industrialists with different perspectives but similar aims for Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Patrick Sheehy, the chairman of BAT Industries, is a plain-man's
European, a dispenser of common European home truths. The head of the
UK-based tobacco and financial services group is a frequent speaker at
high-flying European conferences. Yet he looks more at home in a golf club
than the debating chamber.
In his office overlooking the spires of Westminster, Sir Patrick spells out
with inelegant forcefulness his desired way forward across the continent's
undulating terrain.
A firm believer in European integration, Sir Patrick, 62 years old - 43 of
them spent with BAT - favours ratifying the Maastricht treaty. 'Let's stop
the bickering and get Europe to work.' But he has no illusions about where
the treaty will lead. 'I think the Maastricht treaty will be largely
renegotiated in the next negotiations in 1996. I don't think very much in
the treaty will be implemented between now and that time.'
With ruddy cheeks and a rasping chuckle, Sir Patrick presides over one of
Britain's truly global companies. He was born in Burma, started his business
life in Nigeria, Ethiopia and Jamaica, speaks good French and passable
Spanish and Dutch. He organises annual Anglo-French conferences. 'I wouldn't
feel uncomfortable if my wife said: 'Let's retire to Italy or Spain.' '
He is more than a businessman: he spent a year preparing a
government-commissioned report, just published, recommending fixed-term
contracts and performance-related pay for British policemen.
He is, however, no pious grandee. His vision is uncluttered. His goals -
free trade, productivity, prosperity - are straightforward. And his language
is devoid of anything approaching romanticism. 'BAT has done a great deal of
(European) integration. But we haven't reached the high point. We have fewer
factories today in Europe than before. I would imagine that in the next 10
years we would have even fewer. If we had a single currency, we would have a
greater certainty of long-term costs, we would get better productivity in
larger units.'
Sir Patrick is the UK board member of the Association for Monetary Union in
Europe, a group of experts and businessmen promoting economic and monetary
union. But he sees little prospect that it will happen in the next few
years. 'I don't think that we (Europe) will meet the target for a single
currency by 1999. I don't think the Germans really want it. The Danish prime
minister told me this the other day.'
Sir Patrick, a member of the Round Table of European businessmen, believes
in a European business culture. 'If you sat in an American culture, you'd
find a different way of doing things.'
He swaps information on salaries with other European chairmen. Earning
nearly Pounds 1m last year, does Sir Patrick consider himself greedy? 'No I
don't. It's a competitive salary for the job, certainly in European terms.'
What does he do with the money? 'One of the things I always feel is, if I
spent an hour and a half a day on my own affairs, I might be a much more
wealthy person. I leave it to somebody else to manage. I give broad
guidelines as to how I want the risk spread.'
Long-term desire to spread risk, Sir Patrick believes, is the reason why
Britain must remain interested in Emu. 'I cannot conceive of Britain, which
has this huge financial services industry, not being in a single European
currency, when all the other 11 are.'
Sir Patrick supports an early British return to the exchange rate mechanism.
'The sooner we can get back and have currency stability, the better. I don't
feel happier or wealthier, nor do our shareholders, with the fact that we've
devalued by 20 per cent . . . There's a good case for having a currency that
would hold its value. That's what I learnt at school, that money is meant to
be a store of value.'
Deeper western integration is being postponed, but Sir Patrick believes the
EC should press on with eastward expansion. He enthuses about the 'long-term
eastern promise' in BAT's joint ventures with the former Soviet bloc. 'We
made profits in our first year in Hungary - it was not expected.'
As part of efforts to forge stronger eastern links, he believes the EC
should liberalise trade with eastern Europe. 'I think it's deplorable that
we are being so restrictive.'
Western Europe's lack of generosity towards its eastern neighbours
illustrates, he says, a tendency to 'beggar my neighbour policies' among
European governments.
Protectionist tendencies are one reason why Sir Patrick professes no great
admiration for EC politicians, whom he labels as 'out of touch'.
He was pleased however at the change of prime minister in the UK. John
Major, he says, 'prefers to be a member of the (European) club'. People such
as Baroness Thatcher, says Sir Patrick, tend to exacerbate the cultural gap
between Britain and other EC countries. 'The cultural thing is there - yes,
and it's fed by jingoist politicians, if you like.'
Is Lady Thatcher a jingoist? 'Yes, she's a little Englander, if that's the
definition of a jingoist. She keeps on talking about how we have an
alternative of being a strong partner - economic, politically and militarily
 -of the US.
Sir Patrick's view is more down to earth. 'My perception in America is that
they believe Britain is an offshore island on the continent. We make
ourselves out to be much more important to the Americans than we actually
are.'
This is the first in an occasional series on EC personalities. Next week:

FT  09 JUL 93 / Convergence path strewn with crises Two of a kind -
Industrialists with different perspectives but similar aims for Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Jean-Louis Beffa, chairman of Saint-Gobain, the French industrial
conglomerate, surveys Europe from a tower-shaped looking glass, the
company's mirrored office block in the La Defense district of Paris. He does
not much like what he sees.
'We need to pay attention not to Europe's objectives, but to how it
functions,' he says.
Thickset and courteous, Mr Beffa provides ample evidence that
Europe-mindedness can improve corporate health. After steadfastly working
his way up the Saint-Gobain chain of command, he was appointed to the top
job at the then state-owned group in 1986. Now 51, he shepherded it through
privatisation with a mix of elan and elbow-grease. With a series of
acquisitions in Europe and the US, he strengthened Saint-Gobain's position
as Europe's largest maker of glass and insulation materials.
Now, however, profits have fallen, mainly through Europe-wide economic
slowdown, high interest rates and foreign currency devaluations. EC policy
disarray, Mr Beffa says, is nibbling away at the foundations of the
company's business: the European single market.
Further, the stresses of German reunification have disturbed the traditional
balance of interests between France and Germany - which together account for
half Saint-Gobain's turnover. The strains are evident among ordinary people
as well as among politicians.
But Mr Beffa's chief complaint is about lack of economic and political
convergence across the Community. 'There is a crucial difference between an
integrated European Community and one which is merely a zone of free trade.
There has to be a number of areas of common policy - on economic policy,
monetary affairs, social affairs, industrial and commercial policy and so
on. Fragmentation in these areas causes problems. If there are too many
differences, they threaten the existence of the single market.'
Mr Beffa's competitive spirit is not in doubt. He has just examined the
latest results from Pilkington, the UK glassmaker and Saint-Gobain's
arch-rival. His conclusion is polite but triumphant: Saint-Gobain's earnings
ratios are better.
But there are furrows on Mr Beffa's brow. One is caused by exchange rate
difficulties. 'The instability created by the foreign exchange movements in
September have been extremely harmful. When other EC currencies devalue by
up to 20 per cent, this can cause a brutal shock.
'Sharp fluctuations of foreign exchange rates undermine the calculations
made on where to site specialised production facilities.'
Because of the company's range of EC manufacturing sites outside France  -
mainly in Germany, the UK, Italy and Spain - 'Saint-Gobain can shield itself
to a certain extent against these developments. But these exaggerated
movements must be avoided,' says Mr Beffa.
A second, linked, concern is French economic weakness - caused partly by
high domestic interest rates to maintain the franc's parity against the
D-Mark. 'For us, 1993 will be a very difficult year. But the worst point of
the recession could be in the second half of this year - 1994 should see a
certain up-turn.'
A further reason for Saint-Gobain's weak-er performance has been increased
competition from eastern Europe in products such as flat glass. 'Exports of
some eastern European products have rapidly increased.' Access to EC markets
needs to be 'organised'. 'We must work out some firm rules of the game.
Otherwise, the west will suffer painful consequences in terms of higher
unemployment.'
In Mr Beffa's critique of the way the Community works, he refuses to join in
criticism by some French politicians that Britain is trying to undercut
other countries' wage rates through devaluation and 'social dumping'.
Although Mr Beffa says the UK shows 'a relative lack of enthusiasm for
Europe', he adds: 'This is not enough to make me say that everything Britain
does or says is anti-European. Sometimes you even need British pragmatism -
the tendency to look at the short-term and not just at the horizon.'
Mr Beffa is more concerned about costs in Germany, where 15,000 of the
100,000 workforce is employed. Mr Beffa says wage costs are 5 per cent to 10
per cent higher than in France. During Germany's unification-induced boom
between 1989 and 1991, the impact of the extra costs was offset by higher
sales. 'Now that German activities have been hit by the German downturn, we
need to bring our costs in line with volumes.'
On the wider question of the Maastricht timetable for economic and monetary
union, he says Germany holds the key. 'If, by the end of the year, there is
a substantial cut in German interest rates, we will be going in the right
direction. Otherwise, there will be problems.'
Two shorter-term goals take precedence over the longer-term Emu objective.
One is achievement of currency stability. The second concerns the
Bundesbank's monetary policy. The Maastricht treaty, he says, 'laid down an
objective for the future. But we need a plausible path for the transition
period before we get there.
'What is important is not whether we have one day a single currency, whether
it's the Ecu or anything else. It is much more important that countries
follow coherent and convergent economic policies to bring exchange rate
stability, and that the central bank in charge looks at the economic
situation across the whole of the European Monetary System when making
decisions on interest rates.'
Mr Beffa leaves to the politicians the question of how to attain more
convergence. Yet without it, he knows the view from Saint-Gobain's tower
will become still cloudier. 'If each country follows different policies, the
economic crisis can only be deeper and longer.'

FT  09 JUL 93 / Letter: EdF's position miscast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr CHRISTIAN NADAL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The article 'Where big is beautiful', which was published in your Power
for Europe survey (June 22), is factually incorrect.
It states that: 'EdF's view of privatisation was reflected earlier this year
in a series of highly critical reviews of the UK experience. The reports,
which EdF commissioned from outside consultants, concluded that
privatisation in Britain was characterised by price increases, economic
disruption . . .'
EdF never commissioned these reports on the British electricity system. The
reports to which you refer were commissioned by the Comite d'Entreprise of
EdF, which is entirely independent of management influence and in no way
represents the views of EdF's management.
In France, members of Comite d'Entreprise are composed of staff
representatives. In accordance with French law, a Comite d'Entreprise has
funds set aside for commissioning external stud-ies.
On February 24, David Buchan, FT correspondent in Paris, attended the press
conference organised by EdF staff representatives who presented the reports
mentioned above. This was correctly reported in your paper at the time.
Unfortunately an error was made when this story was repeated in your survey.

FT  09 JUL 93 / Letter: Ambiguity over provision of careers guidance is
wasteful
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr RICHARD BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Howard Davies is right in saying Training and Enterprise Councils
should not be directly involved in providing careers guidance, but should be
strategic overseers ('Dear David: shall I stay on at school?', July 7). What
is surprising is the suggestion that this is controversial. The 1993-94
Guidance to Tecs from the departments of trade and industry and employment
states: 'Tecs should as a rule contract out provision of services rather
than deliver it directly.' The president of the board of trade's
introduction makes clear: 'I do not see Tecs as the direct deliverers of
services where these are available from others.'
Ambiguity between enabling and delivering services is perpetuating a
confusing, wasteful and inefficient patchwork of services in both careers
guidance and the whole panoply of business and enterprise services. This
masks the true effects of public spending, and distorts the influence of the
marketplace. Richard Brown,
director of policy,

FT  09 JUL 93 / Arts: One very sexy Dream
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALANNAH HOPKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
You would think that an Irish ancestry had suddenly been discovered by the
Bard. This Gate Theatre project is the second Shakespeare comedy to be given
a major production in Dublin this year, and there are two productions of
Romeo and Juliet and two Hamlets coming up, plus Othello and The Winter's
Tale in the autumn.
This is a director's Dream, a bold inheritor of the famous 1970 Peter Brook
production, deriving from the same theories of the Polish critic Jan Kott
which, baldy summarised, suggest that the Dream is in fact all about sexual
repression. The director, Joe Dowling, is one of the best things to come out
of the Abbey Theatre in the last 20 years. Since leaving there after policy
disagreements in 1985 he has worked mainly in North America and the West
End.
The opening scene at the court of Theseus is played on a bare stage, with
the royal thrones on a central dais raised above the heads of the defiant
young lovers. From the very start a masterly directorial hand is evident in
the way that gesture, even pantomime, is used to subvert the familiar words.
For example, when Hermea refuses to marry the chosen suitor, Theseus's sulky
bride-to-be Hyppolita silently gives her a sisterly kiss.
The transformation of Hayden Griffin's originally austere set into an
earthy, menacing fairyland owes much to the art of the lighting designer,
Rupert Murray. Large phallic inflatables take up most of the floor space and
are shaded in ever-shifting browns and greens. The funky-punk fairies dance
dementedly in painted body suits embellished with feathers and fur. Oberon
glides on as a cross between Dracula and Superman with heavy brown y-fronts
worn over his cat suit, a long translucent cape swinging from his shoulders.
It is essential for this reading of the play that the parts of Theseus and
the fairy King Oberon are played by the same actor, similarly Hyppolita and
Titania are doubled, as are the Master of Revels Philostrate and Puck in
order to emphasise the parallels between the rigid, repressed court and the
freedom of the fairy world. This tightens the play up and makes sense of
hitherto problematical sets of characters.
Stephen Brennan struts a sexy Oberon, but also gives him warmth and depth,
while his Theseus is cold and pompous, but not beyond redemption. Flo
MacSweeney's Titania is a bit of an airhead, but her Hyppolita is a woman of
commanding presence. Evroy Duur, as a black Philostrate, is unremarkable; as
Puck his colour makes him, as he should be, different from the fairies, but
his heavy build and lithe movements and his strange way with the verse count
for more.
His accent also contributes to the pleasantly cosmopolitan feel of this
production, in which Irish accents mix easily with more conventional English
ones. So does the score by the Canadian composer, Keith Thomas. Do not be
put off by the fact that it contains elements of rock and rap; it is also
influenced by Irish dances, Elizabethan music, Broadway hits and more, but
Thomas never overdoes an effect. One of the best of these is a live
percussionist who greatly enhances the fairy scenes.
Outstanding among an exceptionally good cast of 'mechanicals' who present a
more than usually hilarious 'play within the play' is Stanley Townsend,
whose swaggering Bottom will be long remembered not only for an uncannily
realistic ass's head, but also for a gloriously protracted death in his role
as Pyramus. In fact all 21 members of the cast display admirable polish and
generate extraordinary energy. If there is no great subtlety in Dowling's
vision, at least his interpretation is clear, and its lively presentation
provides an often magical and consistently enjoyable evening of theatre.

FT  09 JUL 93 / Arts: The self-destructive demolition man - Art Exhibitions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LYNN MACRITCHIE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The art world has a hunger for self-destructive heroes and Gordon
Matta-Clark, famous for sawing buildings in half, and son of the surrealist
painter Roberto Matta, seemed a perfect example of a dubious stereotype. He
was dead at 35. I approached the retrospective of his work which now fills
London's Serpentine Gallery prepared to be cynical, but came away impressed.
For it is ultimately not the daring of the famous set pieces - where the
artist cut away whole sections of buildings, revealing and articulating the
unseen spaces within - that is so striking, but the underlying seriousness
and consistency of approach that Matta-Clark brought to all of his work,
from the smallest drawing to the grandest project.
The exhibition repays careful attention, and indeed requires it, as many of
the pieces on show are photographic records of projects or sketches and
notes for activities. There is also a comprehensive video programme, well
worth seeing for a glimpse of the New York loft scene as well as the drama
of the artist in action, power saw in hand, making his inimitable 'cuts'
through the abandoned buildings of the New York environs or the tenements of
Paris.
Matta-Clark was one of the artists living and working in Manhattan during
the 1970s who sought a wider agenda for their activities than that defined
by the writings of Clement Greenberg, who insisted on the separateness of
different art forms and the primacy of abstraction. Their generation was
anxious to break away from the concept of a pre-eminent form or formula for
art, seeking inspiration through cross media experimentation.
Matta-Clark, trained originally as an architect, questioning and innovative
by nature, embodied this principle as well as being an active participant in
the group discussions and collaborative works, which embraced painting,
sculpture, dance, theatre, film and video in an attempt to expand not just
the form but the content of artistic activity.
These young radicals wanted art to be about life, and to live in New York at
that time was to experience a great conurbation in crisis, a metropolis that
seemed to have lost its sense of identity. The most obvious manifestation of
this malaise was urban decay. Huge tracts of the city in areas such as the
South Bronx and Lower East Side stood derelict, the buildings scarred by
fire.
Matta-Clark began to work in these environments, places where courage was
required just to walk down the street. 'I made a series of visits to . . .
ghetto areas . . . cutting away rectangular sections of the floor or walls
to create a view from one space into another. The sections were . . .
removed from their original positions and taken to an art gallery.'
As Dan Graham put it: 'Matta-Clark used houses and building structures which
were about to be demolished and created deconstructed 'ruins' which reveal
hidden layers of socially concealed architectural and anthropological . . .
meaning.'
One of the most satisfying of these was done not in New York but in Paris.
'Conical Intersect' was made for the Paris Biennale of 1975. The exhibition
includes photographic, film and videotape records of the piece, which
involved removing a large section of wall, floors and ceilings from two 17th
century tenements standing next to the skeletal form of the newly-rising
Centre Pompidou.
Filmed from across the street, chips of stone first begin to fly from the
ancient wall, as if a huge chick was struggling to break free from the
blackened stone. Then a great slab falls away, revealing the hard-hatted
figures of Matta-Clark and an assistant through the sizeable hole their
hammers and saws have wrought. They continue to work, removing floor
supports and sections of internal wall to create a spiralling curving shape,
the abandoned space becoming a living sculpture before our eyes. Its final
destruction was effected by bulldozer immediately the project was finished,
which the film also shows.
Watching, the difference between creation and destruction becomes clear.
Matta-Clark's intervention, by recognising and revealing for the last time
the principles of its construction, gave the ancient building one more flash
of life before 'progress', the one certainty of city existence, brought
about its end.
Seen from a distance of 20 years, Matta-Clark's work, and some of the
activities with which he was associated, have a curious innocence. The
festivals and performances, the discussions and debates, the communal
artworks addressed serious social issues in a spirit of celebration. But
things change. 'That was before the drugs,' as one former participant
remarked.
It was not drugs but cancer that killed Gordon Matta-Clark. It is hard to
imagine what he might have been doing now, and sad that he is no longer
bringing his energy and inventiveness to bear in an art world which some
feel has once more withdrawn into its own concerns, further removed than
ever from engagement with those profound social contradictions which he
explored with such elan.

FT  09 JUL 93 / Arts: Ado, a joy, a triumph - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shakespeare has returned to Shaftesbury Avenue for the first time since
nobody seems quite sure when. He may even stay there for a while if this
production of Much Ado About Nothing is anything to go by.
For a start, it is extremely funny. Here is a West End audience laughing out
loud and frequently at Shakespearean jokes. Matthew Warchus's direction is
also very clever: a new interpretation without fundamentally deviating from
the text. It could, for a time, become definitive, for it stands the old
conventional assumptions about the play upside down.
One of the keys is Mark Rylance's Benedick. This is not an urbane,
self-confident figure, admired by all women yet determined to keep a certain
distance. On the contrary, Rylance is physically small and not obviously
attractive. He speaks with a heavy Northern Ireland accent and seems
self-condemned to bachelorhood because he cannot believe that anyone would
marry him, let alone Beatrice. Everyone else in the play speaks fairly
normal English.
Janet McTeer's Beatrice is physically very large beside him, almost gawky.
She enters to summon Benedick to dinner eating a banana in a
none-too-elegant fashion. She does not dress well either, and nor do any of
the other women: sort of 1920-ish costumes picked up from Oxfam many years
later. Ms McTeer's hair is nearly always a mess.
On the other hand, this Beatrice is plainly a dominating personality, more
interested in her intellect than her appearance. Presumably she admires
Benedick for his defensive wit and because, like her, he is slightly outside
the physical norm. The interpretation helps to make sense of the one jarring
note in an otherwise amiable play: her sudden command to Benedick to kill
Claudio. It comes close to being in character, as if she is initiating a
coup by the most intelligent people in the play.
Beatrice and Benedick apart, the chief wonder of Much Ado is the sheer
Englishness of the justice scenes. Here are officers of the watch thoroughly
out of their depth both with the law and the language: clearly the underdogs
in the social hierarchy. The appropriately named Dogberry uses malapropisms
long before Sheridan invented them. Yet what do these incompetent, bumbling
officers do? They apprehend the villains in a way that their superiors could
never attain to. A great deal of the mythology about English justice and the
English character is contained in these sections. They were the forerunners
of the Bobby on the beat.
Dogberry is admirably played by Gerard Kelly, but if you want the additional
pleasure of a tiny vignette, watch Brian Shelley as Verges, the junior
officer who is hardly allowed a word.
He longs to be allowed at least to shake hands with Leonato, the Governor of
Messina, at the end, but the officious Dogberry pushes him aside. Along with
Bottom in A Midsummer Night's Dream, here is Shakespeare as the
quintessential Englishman who probably liked cricket.
The reason, I suppose, why the Bard is now so seldom played in the West End
is that he is so expensive. Even Much Ado About Nothing contains 18
characters, and there is of course a diet of Shakespeare at the Barbican and
the RNT. Yet this production, mounted by Thelma Holt, shows that it can be
done. The direction is as fresh and inventive as you are likely to find at
the established institutions, and on the second night the audience loved it.
Long may it last]

FT  09 JUL 93 / Arts: Threat to orchestras
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Arts Council is close to a kill. For years it has tried to reduce the
number of symphony orchestras in London. It would like to cut the four - the
LSO, LPO, RPO and the Philharmonia - to two, believing this will give London
two orchestras of guaranteed world class quality.
But the orchestras have been unwilling to commit suicide. Yesterday the
Council announced that it would continue to fund generously the LSO, which
seems to be on a creative high, but the other three will have to make out a
case for future subsidy before a committee chaired by Sir Leonard Hoffman.
He must choose just one for support.
But his card is marked. The Council has poured money into the LPO, setting
it up as the resident orchestra at the South Bank. It looked with favour on
its merger with the Philharmonia, which also has a base on the South Bank.
It has hinted that it would consider a merged organisation and fund extra
players. The obvious aim is to squeeze out the RPO, which is considered too
commercial and has seen its subsidy reduced to Pounds 400,000, just 7 per
cent of its revenue. The LSO and the LPO already receive Pounds 1,128,500 a
year.
But if the Council is moving towards a decision on orchestras it is still
unwilling to name the 10 theatre companies it has marked for closure. Under
a revision of its priorities it is giving Pounds 664,000 more to dance,
Pounds 460,000 to visual arts, and Pounds 156,000 to education. Drama is
paying the price, losing 3.6 per cent of its Pounds 40.1m budget, and 10
regional companies have been prepared for execution. But the decision has
been delayed while regional Arts Boards have their say.
All this is taking place against the expectation of a 2 per cent,reduction
in government support for the Arts Council in 1994-95. If the Council
manages to do better in the chancellor's Budget some of the threatened drama
companies will survive. But all arts companies can expect to receive 2 per
cent less next year than they get now, and with falling box office, business
sponsorship, and local authority revenue, this is creating a deepening
crisis.

Since almost all soap opera leaves me stone cold, it is difficult to summon
up much concern at the passing of Eldorado which ends today (7.00 BBC1).
There seems little doubt that, had it been allowed to continue for a few
more months, it would have begun to do its intended task: hold up the
ratings on week-nights when 'EastEnders' is off. But given the present
politics of broadcasting, it needed to succeed instantly to survive, and no
soap opera has ever done that. Will Alan Yentob, now controller of BBC1 as
well as BBC2, do what his predecessor was dissuaded from and commission
Casualty as a three-times-a-week half-hour drama to replace 'Eldorado'?
Hospital drama is one of the earliest, commonest and most successful types
of soap.
In his third Reith Lecture (9.30 Radio 3), Professor Edward Said considers
intellectuals both as expatriates and as people on the margins of their own
societies, and ponders whether exile inspires their thinking. Said, himself
both an intellectual and a Palestinian who lives in the US, seems ideally
placed to judge.

FT  09 JUL 93 / Arts: Students rise to a Queen - Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN ALLISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The London Royal Schools' Vocal Faculty is marking the Tchaikovsky centenary
with Queen of Spades. The choice raised a doubt or two prior to performance:
the colleges seemed to be neglecting an opportunity to explore among the
composer's rarer operas. But at Monday's performance almost all misgivings
were dispelled (except over the Faculty's decision to give the opera in
often unidiomatic Russian): for what emerged was one of the most
consistently strong student stagings of recent years.
The Tchaikovsky brothers' adaptation of Pushkin - Modest served as
librettist - is far from faithful to the original; and in the Royal College
of Music's Britten Theatre Malcolm Fraser's production removes it even
further. Taking as a starting point the story's final lines, which tell of
Herman's insanity, he stages the opera as Herman's recollection of the
events that led to his undoing. Tchaikovsky's music may suggest something
different, but Fraser's staging is carefully thought through and brilliantly
executed.
Herman is on stage for much of the evening - the opening boy-soldiers'
chorus is enacted as a childhood memory - but most of the dramaturgy remains
unchanged. Fraser's coup de theatre is the masked ball and pastorale of Act
2, staged as a nightmarish memory of the Countess's funeral, the Master of
Ceremonies now a heavily bearded Russian Orthodox priest, the top-hatted
guests dressed in black and wearing deathly masks. Fay Conway's lavish
costumes are of the composer's time, with Prince Yeletsky a Tsar Nicholas
look-alike.
The opera, performed in Roger Butlin's single set, gains from the intimacy
of the Britten Theatre. Outstanding in Monday's cast (the first of two
alternating sets) was the Lisa of Susannah Glanville, a gleaming soprano who
sang in well-projected Russian. James Barrett, a dramatically strong Herman,
tended to force his tenor; this production downplay's the character's
heartlessness in favour of wild-eyed insanity, expressions which Barrett
adeptly conveyed. James Lawrence was a mellifluous but restrained Yeletsky,
Paul McNamara a debonair Tomsky. The Bulgarian Violetka Ivanova was a
vocally healthy Countess; another Bulgarian, the bass Tihomir Androlov,
stood out as an idiomatic Surin.
The chorus was strong. Michael Rosewell drew excellent playing from the
orchestra, passionate but not always dark enough. That element was
abundantly provided in the staging.
Britten Theatre, Royal College of Music, London SW7: last performance
tonight.

Japanese is one of the world's most complex languages, so transmitting
information in Kanji, Hiragana, and Katakana - the three alphabets - on to a
trading screen poses a challenge for users of financial information systems.
However, one of Japan's big banks is now operating with a new version of
Fist, the dealing room system, which can recognise characters in Japanese.
It is used in the bank's new equities trading division.
Developed by Kapiti of the UK, Fist can be converted into other languages
such as Arabic and Cyrillic.
Also, among European languages, it will recognise unusual characters (as in
Swedish), French accents and cedillas and German umlauts. The company claims
Fist is the only trading system with such multi-lingual capabilities.

Retailers often have only a hazy idea of which promotions work best and what
attractions tempt shoppers most. To help them identify what makes people
stop and buy, Global Systems has come up with SelectaCount, a small device
for counting and recording those going past, stopping and even picking up
products.
SelectaCount is a development of another product designed to trigger spoken
messages for point-of-sale displays. Anthony Prior, managing director, says
its potential retail and market research applications are numerous.
It works by measuring the minute effect a body has on a sensitive electronic
circuit. 'It's so sensitive, it can even measure people hiding behind doors,
walking past a shop window or even standing behind a brick wall.'
SelectaCount can be rented from 75p a week or bought for around Pounds 150.

FT  09 JUL 93 / Technology: Grabbing the elusive protein - Virtual reality
is set to spark a revolution in drug design
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DELLA BRADSHAW
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A tiny office crammed with electronic equipment in York University's
chemistry department seems a far cry from the brave new world of virtual
reality, promoted as the future craze in computer games technology.
But Rod Hubbard and his team at York are on the way to demonstrating that
virtual reality - VR - could bring strong commercial benefits, not least in
the increasingly complex world of new drug design.
In a research project unique in Europe, the York team, working with Glaxo,
is devising ways of looking at the structure of proteins through the
visionary world of the VR headset.
With the space-age headset in place, a ribbon-like representation of the
protein floats across the field of vision. A turn of the head and the ribbon
protein floats away; the touch of a button and it floats forward, engulfing
the VR user. By touching another button the VR traveller can grasp the
ribbon and turn it in every direction. New atoms can be added, others
changed.
Proteins are especially suited to visualisation because they are such large
molecules, explains Hubbard. 'You're dealing with hundreds of thousands of
different objects that have to be manipulated.'
To build new proteins, researchers need to visualise them in three
dimensions and understand the way in which particular atoms are presented on
their surface. If scientists understand how the protein's structure relates
to its function, then the function can be changed by altering that
structure.
Peter Murray-Rust, head of the protein structure group at Glaxo, believes
the VR system could help Glaxo to understand and manipulate protein
molecules.
'We want to grab hold of it. We want to be able to twist it around and ask
questions about it.' But he quells any excessive enthusiasm for the project
by placing any benefits of the York research squarely in the medium- or
long-term.
Murray-Rust believes the explosion in information about proteins means that
visualisation will be essential in the future to enable chemists to do their
job - 'paper and two-D images' will not be enough. 'We're in the middle of a
revolution. A lot of drug discovery in the next decade will be
information-driven as well as laboratory-driven. We will be flooded with
information which will change the way pharmacologists work.'
In the late 1970s researchers recognised the need to visualise proteins.
They needed to represent large numbers of atoms, move them around in real
time and link the images with a computer database so that the molecules
could be interrogated.
The computer industry's response in the 1980s was to produce 'stereo'
computers. In today's stereo systems two pictures alternate rapidly on the
screen up to 60 times a second. By donning a pair of special spectacles -
sophisticated versions of the three-dimensional spectacles given away with
many a schoolboy comic - the brain is fooled into seeing depth in the
molecule structure.
The technology was an important step towards the use of VR in molecular
modelling. Another was advances in computer workstations, which brought
immense computing power to the scientist's fingertips. But they did not
solve the basic problem of how scientists react with the molecules - tapping
into a keyboard or using a mouse was not intuitive to the scientist.
As the initial year of the project at York University comes to a close, the
research team has a prototype system up and running. Murray-Rust emphasises
that it is a prototype and has limitations, but he is confident it will be
the forerunner of equipment Glaxo will need to use in the future for new
drug development.
One particular limitation, says Murray-Rust, is the low resolution of the
two liquid-crystal television screens which sit inside the VR helmet and
display the images. He believes the quality needs to be improved by a factor
of four before the hardware could bring real benefits, but it could be
several years before such systems are available at the right price.
Today, two types of system are available which do provide higher-quality
images, but both are far more costly than the Pounds 30,000 to Pounds 40,000
system that the York chemists are using. The first is a military technology
which uses fibre-optic cables to bring 1m pixels, or picture elements, to
each screen. The second uses heavier four-inch square cathode ray tubes
which give superior picture quality but are so heavy that they have to be
suspended from a boom and are impractical for many applications.
Researchers also need to think carefully about the software and the way
proteins are represented, believes Murray-Rust.
'No matter how good the displays, we need to think quite carefully about how
we interact with the molecules.'
At York, post-doctoral researcher Mike Hartshorn has spent much of the past
year developing the visual representation of the protein structures. The
next stage, which should last for a further three years, is 'to build real
pieces of software to do real science,' as Hubbard puts it.
In common with Murray-Rust, Hubbard is dismissive about much of the hype
that has surrounded virtual reality. 'One problem is that people think
virtual reality is about walking around. But you get very tired, very
quickly,' he points out. 'We're trying to develop applications sitting
down.' Hubbard believes the widespread use of VR in molecular modelling will
not happen until the price of the hardware drops.
Jones believes that could happen quite quickly. As the technology is refined
the very latest equipment will be introduced at the same price as the
previous models, but the outdated equipment will drop swiftly in price, he
says. 'The level of performance we have today will be available at lower and
lower costs.'
Hubbard is also sceptical about the range of commercial applications for
which VR will be used, largely because so few applications required stereo
systems in the 1980s. 'I cannot understand all this hype. Where are all
these applications that need virtual reality that didn't need stereo in the
1980s?'
Howard Rippiner, marketing communications manager of Silicon Graphics, which
specialises in three-D and VR graphics systems, believes the demand will be
much greater for VR because it fulfils a wider range of uses. 'Chemistry is
probably the only major user of stereo devices because in molecular
modelling it is essential to see which atom is in front of another,
something which is not essential in other applications.'
Jones points to the many commercial applications for which Division has sold
VR systems - designing kitchens and even assessing lighting requirements.
But the time taken to develop the software for the systems - Jones estimates
it takes one man-year of time to get the best out of a VR system - is
unlikely to find many friends in the commercial world.
That could be overcome once off-the-shelf software is available.
'Applications for the end-user will come over the next year or two,' Jones
estimates.
As for chemists, they are at an advantage, points out Hubbard.
'We're not as constrained as other applications in representing the real
world,' he says. 'In many ways we're not working in virtual reality at all,
because we don't know what molecules look like. There is no reality we have
to recreate.'

FT  09 JUL 93 / Management: Rolling out the contract
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER LORENZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Controversy has raged over the British practice of giving many company
directors three-year rolling service contracts since the UK's largest
pension fund declared war on them a month ago. But few people have stopped
to question the difference between rolling contracts and three-year,
fixed-term ones.
It is not always as great as it seems.
Alastair Ross Goobey, chief executive of Postel, who is leading the
campaign, says that 'a fixed (and renewable) contract of up to three years
gives us no qualms'.
Why not, when quite a number of three-year 'fixed' contracts are actually
renewed every year?
This makes them, in effect, rolling contracts of between two and three
years, depending how much time has elapsed.
The practice of such annual renewals is well-known to the highly-respected
Monks Partnership, which specialises in boardroom pay.
In a study undertaken a year ago, two-thirds of the chairmen and chief
executives of a sizeable sample of large companies said they were on notice
periods of exactly three years. Less than a fifth were on between one year
and three, 7 per cent were on less than a year, and almost a tenth were on
three years plus.
There has been little change since 1992, says Monks, although a few
companies have cut notice periods from three years to two. Most of the
36-month notice periods are of the truly rolling variety, but some seem to
be 'fixed', the firm adds.
With the emergence of this further quirk in British executive
feather-bedding, one can only admire last week's action of one large
company, GEC, in replacing three-year rolling contracts by a three-year
fixed term for new appointees; thereafter, they now get only a one-year
rolling contract.
Other companies should follow suit.

FT  09 JUL 93 / People: Shirai takes the wheel at Nissan Europe
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Japanese carmaker Nissan's European operations have a new man at the helm.
He is Tadahiro Shirai, until recently the parent company's board director in
charge of the marine division, as well as the industrial and textile
machinery divisions.
Shirai, a law graduate who joined Nissan in 1960, becomes president of
Amsterdam-headquartered Nissan Europe in succession to Yoshikazu Kawana, who
has been directing Nissan's affairs in the UK and on the Continent for the
past four years.
A keen golfer and music lover, Shirai also becomes chairman of Nissan Motor
Manufacturing (UK), the Sunderland-based car manufacturing subsidiary now on
course towards making 270,000 cars a year. Additionally, he has been
promoted to managing director of the board of directors of Nissan Motor
Company in Japan.
Kawana, who moved back to Japan last month, had been running Nissan Europe
since it was set up in 1989 to integrate Nissan's various sales, design,
development, manufacturing and distribution activities en route to becoming
a significant production presence in Europe.
During Kawana's tenure four European-produced vehicles have been launched -
the UK-built Primera and Micra models, and the Spanish produced Serena
multi-passenger vehicle and Terrano off-roader.
Kawana himself has been promoted to executive managing director of Nissan
Motor Company responsible for the overseas operations and parts groups.

FT  09 JUL 93 / Management: Bonus for quality
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Toshiba's UK copier salesmen will not necessarily get bonus payments for
hitting their sales targets. Dealers must also conform to the company's
quality programme to gain their sales incentives.
Two years ago Toshiba launched a campaign to persuade its complete UK dealer
network to register for BS5750, the widely used but increasingly
controversial quality systems standard. It recently decided to provide an
additional encouragement by linking incentive payments to adherence to its
quality programme.
Number three in the UK copier market after Xerox and Canon, Toshiba has
focused on its quality programme to boost customer satisfaction, says Angus
Drever, general manager. Thirteen of the company's 80 UK dealers have
qualified for BS5750 and another 20 have applied for registration. Toshiba
hopes to have its entire network registered within the next two years.
BS5750 has attracted criticism because it is not a guarantee of product or
service quality but a measure of the consistency of a company's internal
procedures. In theory it could be obtained by providing a poor but
consistent level of service.
To flesh out the standard Toshiba insists that its dealers agree to
implement its code of practice, provide an eight-hour response time and
regularly monitor customer satisfaction. 'We could have set a 16-hour
response time but nobody wants to wait two days for a repair,' comments
Drever.
Under the second stage of its quality programme, Toshiba has tied
dealer-incentive payments into a 10-point quality programme.
It is too early to say whether the incentive scheme will provide an
additional boost to customer satisfaction. But it does indicate that quality
systems require an attention to detail that goes well beyond buying a
certificate off the shelf.

FT  09 JUL 93 / People: Strong brings a new order into Freemans
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Yesterday retail group Sears announced its second senior management change
in less than a week, as chief executive Liam Strong continues his drive to
lift the performance of the refocused group.
Mike Hawker, 43, managing director of Freemans, the mail order division, has
resigned from the company after 13 years, after Strong decided Freemans was
not improving quickly enough.
'Freemans has had reasonable performance on the whole but profits have not
moved ahead in the way we would like,' Sears says. 'The feeling was that we
needed a new pair of eyes and a new approach.'
Sears announced on Tuesday it was closing Ter Meulen Post, its loss-making
Dutch mail order business that was part of the Freemans division, having
decided it could not be economically turned around.
Hawker will be replaced by Richard Boland (right), who joined Adams, Sears
childrenswear division, in 1989, and became divisional managing director two
years ago.
Boland, 42, has wide retailing experience, having started as an executive
trainee with C&amp;A in 1973, moving to Asda for a year, and then spending five
years at GUS, the UK's biggest mail order group, where he rose to become one
of two group merchandise managers. In 1988 he became joint managing director
of Danielle, a clothing and footwear importer for a year, before joining
Sears.
Described as a 'creative and energetic man, the kind of man who runs down
the hallway', Boland is charged with continuing the move away from the
traditional system of sales agents, towards direct marketing. Some systems
have already been put in place to enable Freemans to handle direct ordering
from customers, rather than purely sales through agents.
Sears announced last Friday the appointment of Andrew Wileman, a partner
with OC&amp;C strategy consultants, as group strategy director.

FT  09 JUL 93 / Management: Lunch your way to the top - Culinary contacts
can help you influence policymakers / Peter Marsh offers a user's guide
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the realm of economics, there has rarely been a better time to eat your
way to the centre of UK policymaking.
The pound's disastrous exit last year from the European exchange rate
mechanism, coupled with the need to rebuild business confidence after the
recession, has spawned a series of efforts by policymakers in Whitehall to
step up contacts over lunch or dinner.
That applies particularly to the Treasury, which is increasing its meetings
with outside economists and business people in an effort to make its
policies more sympathetic to wealth creation.
The following is a user's guide to how the culinary contacts can help you to
win friends and influence people at the centre of the mandinarate.
As a start, you could do worse than to target Alan Budd, the amiable and
thoughtful chief economic adviser at the Treasury.
Appointed just under two years ago as a successor to Sir Terry Burns, now
Treasury permanent secretary, Budd has told associates he wants to make the
department much closer both to people in industry and in the City. His lunch
diary is booked up months ahead.
If you are a manufacturer, and want to entertain a top Treasury official to
lunch plus a day's visit at your factory, you could talk to Duncan Wilson,
of the department's industry division.
Under an edict at the end of last year from Sir Terry, all the department's
top 100 officials are to make at least one industrial visit a year. So far
the programme is going well, with about 50 visits completed or arranged, but
more contacts are needed.
If you fancy a few hours inside the Treasury's immensely gloomy building
close to parliament, you could always try to get on to the Treasury's
industrial prospects committee, which Budd set up last year. Every four
months about 15 planners and economists from companies talk to Budd and
fellow Treasury officials about how they see economic activity.
At these gatherings, some of the more revealing comments are made over lunch
at the Chancellery, the Treasury's private dining room where menus have been
greatly improved over the past two years. 'The food is now quite decent, the
sort you might expect at the City, with reasonable wine as well,' according
to one participant.
If you can't get on to the industrial prospects committee but are
economically qualified, you could try your luck as one of the Treasury's
seven wise men of economic advisers. The group - set up in January - is
showing every sign of working cohesively. However a vacancy may arise soon,
either because of the pending retirement from Cambridge University of
Professor Wynne Godley, one of its members, or because one of the other wise
men becomes disillusioned with the results of their six meetings a year.
Assuming you have an interest in good food as well as economics, you could
contact Walter Eltis, chief economic adviser to Michael Heseltine, trade and
industry secretary.
Until his heart attack, Heseltine had been showing an increasing interest in
talking to top industrialists about how they see the economy, leaving it to
Eltis to arrange meetings with lesser lights in big companies at the level
of senior economist or finance director.
Although the future status of a 'round table' of industrialists set up by
Heseltine and which met for the first time recently is unclear, the lunch
was described as 'fantastic' by one of the people attending, Sir Christopher
Lewinton, chairman of engineering group TI.
Maybe you hanker after something slightly less formal. Top civil servants,
many from the Treasury, meet industry leaders 10 times a year under the
auspices of the Open Dining Club. The gatherings are normally held in a
London club or hotel, the food is good and the conversation relaxed.
Membership is by invitation only but if you are feeling confident, why not
talk to the man in charge, David Kendall, chairman of paper company Bunzl.
If you have a penchant for finance, then another dining club, White City,
may be for you. The members are mainly from the Treasury, banks and finance
houses and the gatherings are organised by David Anderson of Lazard
Brothers. At a slightly lower level, regular lunchtime meetings involving
civil servants and industry managers are held under the auspices of the
Institute of Management. If interested contact Alex Beattie of engineering
company Haden Young. The Department of Employment normally hosts the
sessions, but the food is nothing special.
The Confederation of British Industry has been finding more of a voice
recently on economic policy and the best way to influence this is to join
its economic affairs committee, which meets monthly in the afternoon.
Although occasionally luminaries such as Treasury officials turn up to give
a presentation, one drawback is that the only food or drink on offer is a
cup of tea.
Probably the grandest place to have lunch while discussing matters of
economic import is at the Bank of England court or directors' council. No
one quite knows how people are invited on to this but the current crop of
non-executive directors contains a fair sprinkling of well-known names from
industry who are brought in to advise the Bank's full-time executives.
Meetings are every Thursday, when matters discussed can include monetary
policy and how the pound is faring outside the ERM. The lunch is described
by one insider as 'plain cooking, the kind one would find on a weekday in a
country house'. Soup followed by veal cutlet is often on the menu and the
dessert is nearly always rice pudding.
Finally, who from the business community has the best record in getting to
grips with government on economic policies? A strong candidate is Sir David
Lees, chairman of GKN, who is on good terms with the Treasury as chairman of
the CBI committee and also a court member at the Bank.
Others on anyone's list of outsiders with an inside track include Ross
Buckland, chief executive of Unigate, Roger Hurn, chairman of Smiths
Industries, Nigel Whittaker, a Kingfisher director, Ian Gibson, head of
Nissan's UK manufacturing arm, Richard Freeman, ICI's chief economist, and
Howard Davies, the ex-Treasury man who is CBI director general and who meets
his old colleagues roughly once a month.
However, this list is not exhaustive. With enough imagination and
persistance - plus a decent appetite - you could find yourself on it, too.

FT  09 JUL 93 / Survey of Lebanon (5): I hope I can make a difference -
Interview / Prime minister Rafik al-Hariri shares his ambitions with Roger
Matthews
</HEADLINE>

THE LEBANESE PRIME MINISTER discussed his programme of national
reconstruction with the FT. Excerpts follow:
The search for foreign funding:
I am not at all disappointed by the response. We have over Dollars 1bn
committed. Part of it from the Italian government, from the World Bank, the
Kuwaiti Fund, the Arab Fund and the EC. We are also discussing bilateral
protocols with several countries. Things are going well.
Exchange rate policy:
The most important thing is stability. I am not trying to fix the rate. We
are trying to stabilise it, and that is what I have been doing since I took
over. We are not now using our foreign exchange reserves to defend the
currency. Earlier this year some people did try to play with the exchange
rate. They have paid the price. They lost money. There is no law to stop
people speculating. It is a free market.
The Christians and the government:
Maybe some Christian leaders do not feel comfortable with the present
situation. But I am as committed to the Christians as I am to all the
Lebanese. We have Christian ministers in the Cabinet and they are
representative. The whole Lebanese political situation is in a transition
period. The war is finished. During the war not all the normal Lebanese
leaders, the conservatives who led the country during the first 40-50 years,
played an important role.
During the war period a new leadership emerged some of which became popular,
others failed.
In a few years we will see a new leadership emerging from the post-war era.
The next elections in just under three and a half years will give a new
leadership to the country.
I believe that Lebanon cannot be governed by a person, by a sect, by a
religion or by a party. Lebanon was, and always will be, ruled by the
agreement of most of the Lebanese leadership.
Why Hizbollah is still armed:
It is a militia only in the south. It relates to the occupied territory. It
is like any other Lebanese resistance force, but perhaps has more publicity.
You will not find Hizbollah acting as a militia in Beirut or anywhere else,
except in the south.
Every country has its own political situation. You cannot now disarm the
Lebanese who are fighting the occupation (by Israel). The Israelis say they
are not occupiers. This is not true. Once we reach an agreement with Israel
to withdraw and we have our land back, Hizbollah and any other resistance
forces will have no need to keep fighting. And because they are not
fighting, they will not need their arms.
The Middle East peace process:
Our position is very clear. We entered the negotiations on the basis of UN
resolution 425 which includes the withdrawal of Israeli troops from all
Lebanon. We are following the negotiations with the other Arab countries
very closely. You will not see us or any country sign a separate agreement
with Israel.
The Syrian and Israeli presence:
You cannot call the Israeli occupation a 'presence'. It is an occupation.
Syria is playing a completely different role. The Syrians have been trying,
since I came to office, to give all the help they can to the Lebanese
government. They are not interfering in our internal development as a
country - not with me anyway.
The Israeli occupation is not linked to the Syrian presence. The country is
now peaceful and the Syrians are playing a very important role in keeping it
peaceful.
The Lebanese army and security forces are improving every day. The more we
strengthen them, the less we will need Syria. Lebanon and Syria are looking
forward to the day when we are satisfied with the security situation and
they will not want to stay any more.
The 1991 treaty with Syria:
The relationship between the two countries is improving, on the basis of the
independence and sovereignty of both nations. There is a lot of contact
between ministers on both sides to seek the basis of common interest.
In Lebanon we have a tremendous interest in Syria from an economic point of
view. It is a large market for our products. The private sector is also very
strong in Lebanon, much stronger than in any other part of the region.
On the reconstruction of Beirut:
I am the man behind the idea to rebuild central Beirut. In 1975 I was just a
small, poor guy, working in Saudi Arabia, so I did not really know how
Beirut was then.
We do not want to rebuild Beirut as it was. We are not satisfied with it as
it was. It lacked a lot of things in 1975. Communications, roads,
electricity and other things were not that good.
Instead we want Beirut to be a city of the 21st century. We might see an
agreement with Israel coming out of the negotiations. We should be prepared
for it. But we cannot be prepared with the capital as it is now.
Why he became prime minister:
Even my wife does not understand that. But I felt that I could make a
change, and that for the country I must take the job. I had been trying to
help from behind the scenes for a long time before I became prime minister,
in a humanitarian and philanthropic way, and politically through ceasefires
and the Taif Agreement.
So far I do not think my decision was wrong. But there is a big difference
with what I did before. In business you control your work and your
decisions. In politics you must work harder and consider a lot of other
elements. You can never say you have succeeded. I have made a difference:
that is the best I can say.

FT  09 JUL 93 / Survey of Lebanon (6): Little steps in self-assertion -
Foreign Policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROGER MATTHEWS

<TEXT>
IT was once argued by some Lebanese that the country's strength lay in its
weakness: that because it did not have an army, navy or airforce which could
possibly pose a threat to anyone, it would be left alone. As a
miscalculation it ranges alongside those committed by Saddam Hussein of Iraq
during the past dozen years.
From the moment that Palestinian fighters, evicted from Jordan by King
Hussein, descended on Lebanon in 1970, the country became part of a conflict
from which it had successfully stood aloof during successive Middle East
wars. Once drawn in, Lebanon became the battleground on which others pursued
their own agendas. Not only did it lack the strength to resist, but its own
communities willingly became allied to whichever external power offered
political and material assistance.
Thus, at different moments during the extended crisis, the Maronites
welcomed assistance first from the Syrians, then the Israelis and the US,
and finally from Iraq. Their involvement fuelled and extended the battle, so
that today the future stability of Lebanon rests more than ever on a
successful outcome to the Middle East peace process launched in Madrid more
than 18 months ago. Lebanon's capacity to influence that outcome is severely
limited. The principal result of 17 years of fighting has been to leave
Syria as the dominant external force. The regularity with which ministers
travel to Damascus illustrates the extent to which important decisions
depend on the approval of Syria.
Whether Damascus views Lebanon as part of a greater Syria, or principally as
a strategic buffer against Israeli attack, makes little difference. The one
clear, consistent aim of Syria under President Hafez al-Assad has been to
ensure that no other external force exercises greater influence in Beirut.
It has succeeded, to the chagrin of many Lebanese. But many more have come
to accept the necessity of accommodating Syria, as the lesser of many evils.
In the longer term, however, the desire of most Lebanese is for Syria to
withdraw its troops in conjunction with an Israeli pullback from the
southern strip in the south which it has held since 1978. Mr Rafik Hariri
believes that once the security situation in the country is assured Syria
itself will not wish to remain.
The key difference between the two foreign presences is that there is a UN
Security Council resolution (425) demanding the withdrawal of Israel, but
there are agreements signed by the Beirut government accepting the Syrian
presence. These are enshrined in the 1989 Taif agreement and the subsequent
1991 Treaty of Brotherhood, Co-operation and Co-ordination.
The latter document sets out a scheme for extensive political, economic and
military links between the two countries, including the creation of a
supreme council on which the presidents of the two countries would sit. The
council, which has yet to be officially formed, is supplemented by a series
of sub-committees covering issues such as foreign relations, defence and the
economy that would meet every two months, together with a general
secretariat to follow up the implementation of agreements.
The third, rather more indirect presence in Lebanon, is that of Iran.
Through its funding of Hizbollah, the regime in Tehran can influence
developments, at least for so long as Israel's troops and its local allies
remain in a southern strip of Lebanese territory.
The arrangement currently suits Syria, insofar as it is linked to the Middle
East peace process. Syria was also the only Arab country to ally itself with
Iran during Tehran's eight year war with Iraq, a policy largely dictated by
Hafez al-Assad's fierce rivalry with Saddam Hussein.
However, Syria has been careful to ensure that it remains the only conduit
between Iran and its Lebanese allies. Despite the return of many
international airlines to Beirut, there seems to be little possibility of
Iran being allowed to reopen direct flights to Lebanon.
The assumption among many diplomats in Beirut is that there will be no
significant diminution of Hizbollah military activity while the peace talks
show little sign of progress. Equally, Syria will not pull its forces out of
Beirut for fear it would be seen as a concession to Israel.
Any changes in this intricate network of Middle East relations are bound to
have an impact on Lebanon which the government in Beirut is largely
powerless to influence. It will be watching with particular concern the
evolution of American Middle East policy in the wake of the missile attack
on Iraqi intelligence headquarters in Baghdad.
The US determination to respond vigorously to Iraqi provocation, while also
urging its allies 'to contain' Iran - which it describes as foremost sponsor
of international terrorism - seems likely to increase tension between those
countries and the regional governments they identify as American supporters.
While the US is making a modest contribution to rebuilding the Lebanese army
and the civil administration, it is maintaining its ban on Americans
travelling to the country without the express permission of the State
Department. It argues that those responsible for the earlier devastating
attacks on US personnel and facilities are still alive and well, and living
in Lebanon. Mr Hariri's immediate refusal last December to accept the 415
Palestinians expelled by Israel from the West Bank and Gaza offered the
first indication in years that Beirut had the confidence to act
unilaterally. But for it ever to adopt a more consistently independent
foreign policy will require a lasting solution of the region's most durable
conflicts.

FT  09 JUL 93 / Survey of Lebanon (4): Christians lose their dominance -
Politics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROGER MATTHEWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT will take decades for a political system to evolve in Lebanon which could
be seen by most Lebanese as both representative and equitable.
The arrangements bequeathed by the French in 1943 were designed to
perpetuate the constitutional, political and therefore economic dominance of
the Christian community. It was a system which, as Christian leaders rarely
fail to assert, enabled Lebanon to emerge as arguably the most affluent,
cosmopolitan, and sophisticated nation in the Middle East during the three
decades after the end of the Second World War.
One of the most frequent, rhetorical questions asked of visitors to Lebanon
is whether they knew the country before 1975. It was in that year that the
fundamentally flawed system began to unravel, under the pressures of those
who were substantially excluded from political and economic participation,
and by the country's inability to isolate itself from the wider political
turmoil.
In the 17 years of intercommunal warfare and invasion that followed, the
balance of power in the country has certainly changed. But rivalries and
suspicions still run deep and can all too readily be fuelled by developments
in the Arab-Israel conflict, in the Gulf and the current growth of Islamic
fundamentalism.
The core of Lebanon's political difficulties is the fact that its
communities are defined primarily by religion and that each one is a
minority. Worse, each of the largest broadly defined communities -
essentially, Christian, Moslem and Druze - is itself sub-divided. Within
those sub-divisions are powerful, often family-oriented factions which are
themselves often in conflict.
In turn, these rifts have made Lebanese society uniquely vulnerable to
external intervention, sometimes imposed, but at other times requested.
Israel, Syria, the Palestine Liberation Organisation, Iraq, Iran, Libya and
Saudi Arabia have been, and some still are, substantial elements in the
Lebanese political equation. Among the Western nations, the US and France
have also played significant roles.
The biggest loser of the past decade has unquestionably been the Christian
community, Maronite and Orthodox. Demoralised and fragmented, the Maronites
in particular have seen their strength whittled away and, while still vital
for the political and economic reconstruction of the country, feel
increasingly marginalised.
Their high point came in 1982-83 when Israel invaded again in an attempt,
with US co-operation, to rid Lebanon of a Palestinian military presence and
ultimately force out the Syrians. The Israelis succeeded in pushing out the
Palestinian fighters, but could not break the Syrian grip.
Bashir Gemayel, who had violently sought to unite the Christian forces, was
himself assassinated soon after being elected president and the
Israeli-Maronite dream was effectively at an end. Since then the Maronites
have tried, mostly in vain, to stem the ebbing tide of influence, often
exacerbating the trend through their own miscalculations.
The latest and most serious error was the partial boycott of the general
elections called last year under the terms of the Taif Agreement, which was
hammered out in 1989. The agreement provided for a 50-50 Christian-Moslem
representation in Parliament (in place of the 6:5 pro-Christian
arrangement), the eventual termination of official appointments on a
confessional basis, and formalised a Syrian role in Lebanon. The effect of
the boycott was to deny a presence in Parliament for the most representative
Maronite leaders, while creating a generally more pro-Syrian assembly than
would have otherwise have happened.
Another important side effect was to open the Parliamentary door more widely
to candidates of Hizbollah, the militant Shia organisation, and the most
closely watched and discussed political faction in Lebanon today. Hizbollah
grew out of the politicisation of the country's poorest minority, a
development provoked both by economic disparities and by the impact of
Israel's invasions in 1978 and 1982.
Its growth has been fostered by Iran which provides funding, estimated at
close to Dollars 100m a year, and by the provision of weapons to continue
the armed conflict with Israel and its Lebanese surrogates (the so-called
South Lebanon Army) along the southern border.
Hizbollah is the only militia not to have been ordered by the restructured
Lebanese Army to hand in its heavy weapons in the wake of the Taif
agreement. Although other militias are assumed still to have retained some
fighting capacity, including mortars and rocket-propelled grenades,
Hizbollah is by far the most potent of the irregular forces. At the same
time it has established a presence in the newly-evolving political
structure, while developing grassroots support through an extensive social
welfare programme involving hospitals, schools, medicare and food shops for
the poorest sections of society.
Hizbollah appears intent on being ready for every political eventuality. Its
eight members of parliament carry out their tasks assiduously, study issues
closely and contribute to the committees of which they are members. The
militia in the south maintains pressure on Israel's self-declared security
zone, thereby reinforcing its opposition (and that of Iran) to the Middle
East peace process. Its social programme meanwhile provides benefits that
the central government cannot yet match.
Hizbollah's future may depend heavily on external factors. Supplies can only
reach it through Syria, which currently tolerates Hizbollah's military
activities. If Israel and Syria ever reached a peace agreement, including an
Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights and southern Lebanon, Hizbollah
would be required to hand in its weapons. It would then have to choose
whether to opt substantially for a constitutional political role, or resist
the forces ranged against it.
Hizbollah's leaders are also well aware of the political hostility it faces
 -from within the Shia community, particularly from the Amal, the faction
led by Mr Nabbih Berri, the speaker of Parliament who is closely allied to
Syria; by almost the entire Christian community; and by many Sunnis and
Druze.
The success of the Hariri government in alleviating the worst of the
country's economic ills would also in time work against Hizbollah, by
undercutting many of the social services currently provided with financing
from Iran. The extent to which Hizbollah tries to undermine the government
by seeking to stir popular feeling against individual policies, such as the
plan for the redevelopment around the airport and southern suburbs where
many Shia live, could provide an early test of its intentions.
Hizbollah is not, however, without its own internal divisions and almost
certainly mirrors the political structure of Iran where competing groups vie
for influence. Optimists in Lebanon like to be believe that ultimately the
Shia community, and the Hizbollah leadership, are Lebanese nationalists at
heart. They suggest that, given a sustained period of stability, Hizbollah's
supporters, and the affluent members of the community, will come to feel
part of the reformed political system. Pessimists, however, insist that
Hizbollah is intent on the creation of an Islamic state.
These elements of Hizbollah may not be alone. There are also a plethora of
other radical and fundamentalist groups, Shia and Sunni, some of which may
be allied to Hizbollah, others in competition, but which all are opposed to
the return of what they see as government by a narrow, wealthy elite.
The cabinet itself is composed of three distinct groups: first, the
technocratic associates of Mr Hariri; second, men who were chosen primarily
to reflect Syrian interests; and third, leaders of the former militias
(except Hizbollah and the Lebanese Forces). Somehow they have to work
together on the enormous task of avoiding any widening of the political
stresses within the country, while pushing ahead rapidly with their
ambitious but potentially divisive economic programme.
What they need above all is swift progress towards a Middle East peace
settlement and the enthusiastic and generous support of allies in the Arab
and Western worlds. Mr Hariri is aware that time is a critical factor. The
longer his government takes to produce a tangible improvement in living
standards, the greater the risk of his political opponents resorting to
violence.

FT  09 JUL 93 / Survey of Lebanon (2): It's going to take time and money -
Blueprint for Reconstruction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES WHITTINGTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR RAFIK HARIRI'S masterplan to rebuild Lebanon, dubbed Horizon 2000, was
unveiled on March 17, 1993, less than 18 months after the last shell of the
civil war added its part to 17 years of destruction.
By that time the country's infrastructure was in a severe state of
disrepair: Beirut's city centre was a wasteland of prime real estate, only
30 per cent of the country's telephone lines were in order, electricity
supplies were minimal, water was in short supply and often polluted, and the
country's other public services were on the verge of total collapse. The
announcement of the plan was greeted with euphoria.
Nearly four months on and visibly very little has altered. The initial
excitement has given way to cautious optimism. Lebanese are slowly realising
that the formidable scheme will take time, considerable external aid, and a
sustained turnaround in the political and economic situation.
While most wait impatiently for the government's promises to materialise,
the Council of Development and Reconstruction (CDR), which is the
power-house behind Horizon 2000, has been preparing the ground.
The CDR, originally set up in 1977, was resuscitated by Mr Hariri in 1991,
before he took power, to oversee the reconstruction programme. It is a
dynamic and fairly semi-autonomous administrative body which aims to
sidestep government bureaucracy. This has led to some friction between the
CDR and various ministries, but overall it has been highly successful.
Essential infrastructure - electricity, telecommunications, water, sewerage,
schools, hospitals - and the reform of government institutions have been
given priority. The rehabilitation and development of Beirut's international
airport, the ports, and lavish plans for the downtown city centre are still
either on the drawing board or waiting to overcome bureaucratic hurdles.
The total cost of Horizon 2000 is estimated at Dollars 13bn at current
prices over 10 years (Dollars 10bn at constant prices). So far the CDR has
managed to raise Dollars 1.2bn in grants, soft and commercial loans. Of
this, in spite of Mr Hariri's excellent Gulf credentials, only Dollars 250m
has come from Arab funds. Italy is the foremost foreign donor having signed
protocols worth Dollars 450m. The EC and European Investment Bank (EIB) have
committed Dollars 285m and the World Bank Dollars 175m.
According to Mr Nohad Baroudi, the CDR's secretary-general, the government
expects to raise a total of 36 per cent of the nominal capital, less than
Dollars 4bn, in loans and aid. The rest will be financed by internal
borrowing and government revenue.
For an economy that registered a GDP of only Dollars 3.5bn-Dollars 4bn last
year, such sums will be difficult to deliver.
The CDR and government firmly believe that private investment and foreign
aid will flow as a result of increased business confidence in Lebanon. But
until the country rehabilitates its basic infrastructure, and political
stability appears more assured, investors and donors are bound to remain
circumspect.
THE CENTRE OF BEIRUT
The jewel in the crown of Horizon 2000 is the reconstruction of Beirut's
central district. The area, which covers 784,609 square metres of real
estate, was previously the zone which bridged the east and west sides of the
divided city during the war. Its collapsed buildings, riddled with shell
holes, suffered the brunt of the fighting and over 60 per cent of the area
has to be completely demolished and cleared.
A masterplan for its reconstruction has been prepared by the Lebanese
consultancy company Dar al Handasah. It aims to resemble the Beirut of
pre-1975, with its lively souks and residential areas, while at the same
time creating an international business and banking centre.
Before major reconstruction could begin, a solution had to be found to the
myriad ownership and tenants' rights to the land and buildings. With an
estimated 50,000 possible claims of ownership the government responded by
passing an ingenious, although controversial, law in November 1991 to
facilitate the setting up of a real estate company. Solidere, the company
which is due to be formalised soon, will represent the property owners while
also raising capital needed to fulfil the area's rebirth.
Its creation will follow a final judgment by a government committee on the
value of the real estate, currently put at Dollars 1.073bn (averaging
Dollars 1,400 per square metre). Property owners will then have the choice
of either exchanging their land rights for shares in the company or
reclaiming property, for a fee, and carrying the expenses of reconstruction
which has to be completed within two years.
Shares will also be sold to private investors at a total value equal to that
of the area's land value. This should raise over Dollars 1bn in cash for
construction work. Priority will be given to the property owners, the
Lebanese government, and then other Arab nationals. Individual holdings will
be limited to 10 per cent.
Construction companies will be invited to bid for the work and Mr Nasser
Chamaa, secretary general of the Board of Founders charged with establishing
Solidere, predicts that extensive reconstruction will begin in earnest by
the end of this year and will continue in the next century.
RESTORING ELECTRICITY
In the power sector, work is underway to increase electricity generating
capacity from 400 MegaWatts to 1,000 MW by the end of the year, and
eventually 1.500 MW, at the cost of about Dollars 300m.
As most people in Beirut receive only around six hours of government
supplied electricity a day, and far less outside the city, the sector is a
priority for the CDR.
Italy's Ansaldo Energia has won a Dollars 66m contract to repair existing
power stations.
South Korea's Hyundai Corporation is to supply transmission equipment for
Dollars 80m, and France's Bouygues has out-bid rivals to supply Dollars 44m
worth of equipment.
Electricite de France is acting as consultant on the project to the CDR
which hopes to provide power 24 hours a day within 18 months. The project is
being partly financed by Dollars 110m from Arab funds, Dollars 30m from the
Italian protocol and Dollars 35m from the World Bank.
MILLION NEW PHONES
Over the next 18 months, more than 1m new telephone lines are expected to be
installed at a nominal cost of Dollars 80m.
There are currently around 350,000 local lines and 700 international lines
in operation. France's Alcatel-CIT and Sweden's Ericsson have each been
awarded contracts to install around 270,000 lines, worth Dollars 22m to each
company. Germany's Siemens is currently negotiating the installation of
385,000 lines for Dollars 40m.
Meanwhile, MCI International has set up a direct-dial international service
that can offer up to 5,000 lines. Parliament has also approved a law to
allow the establishment of a local cellular telephone network of up to
250,000 lines. Work is being partly financed by some Dollars 90m from the
Kuwait Development Fund and Dollars 15m from the Italian protocol.
TRANSPORTATION
Beirut International Airport is set for substantial expansion over the next
four years.
Plans include a new runway, 16km of runway approaches, the rehabilitation
and expansion of terminal buildings to handle 6m passengers a year, and a
new air traffic control tower, along with a hotel, conference centre and an
extensive duty free shopping area.
The Dollars 350m package goes for tender later this year. Mr Hariri has
boasted that the airport will be one of the most modern in the world when
completed in 1997, although it is not yet clear how it will be financed.
Beirut's main port is also to be upgraded with a new container terminal and
a 280m breakwater extension to be added to the fourth basin. The first two
basins need to be cleared of vessels hit by shells during the war, and
loading equipment and the port's technology will be modernised.
The total package will cost around Dollars 150m and finance is expected to
come from the EIB and Arab funds. Lebanon's two other main ports, Tripoli in
the north and Sidon in the south, are also to be improved. The CDR plans to
inject Dollars 10m into Tripoli, which handles petroleum, and Dollars 7m
into Sidon.
In addition, a Dollars 2bn upgrading of Lebanon's roads, which will include
a Beirut ringroad, a Beirut-Damascus motorway, and a coastal motorway, is
expected to take place over the next 10 years. Plans for this are still at
an early stage.
WATER AND SEWERS
None of the country's six sewage treatment plants is in operation and the
water supply system works at less than 60 per cent of capacity, with 50 per
cent of the water lost through leakages. The CDR is pre-qualifying
contractors to upgrade the water and wastewater systems, and provide solid
waste disposal equipment and compactor trucks.
New landfill areas are also to be developed to prevent further dumping of
waste along the coastline. This is of particular concern in Beirut where
there is a vast rubbish tip on the sea shore.
The total nominal cost of work is expected to be around Dollars 300m and
completion is scheduled within 18 months. Finance will come from the World
Bank, the EIB and Arab funds.
SCHOOLS, HOSPITALS
The war severely disrupted state education at all levels and 1,270 schools
throughout the country are in need of rehabilitation at an estimated cost of
Dollars 65m.
Contracts are at the pre-qualification stage and work is expected to begin
later this year, as is a Dollars 20m rehabilitation programme for the
country's only state university, L'Universite Libanaise. Money will come
from the World Bank and the EEC.
Horizon 2000 also entails a long term Dollars 800m restructuring of the
state school system which will close some of the smaller classrooms in rural
areas and provide transport to larger schools with more facilities.
As in education, the scarcity of adequate facilities in health care was
compensated for by the private sector. According to the Minister of Health,
there are currently 700 public sector beds against 7,000-8,000 private ones.
A rehabilitation programme of 17 of the country's 24 state hospitals will
begin this year at a nominal cost of Dollars 67m. A Dollars 14.5m plan to
build two new district hospitals is underway. Finance will come from French
and Italian protocols, and Arab funds.

FT  09 JUL 93 / Survey of Lebanon (3): Up goes the Lebanese pound - There
are some good economic indicators
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROGER MATTHEWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NO SINGLE event since the end of the fighting has had a greater positive
impact on the Lebanese economy than the appointment of Mr Rafik Hariri as
prime minister.
Lebanese of all confessions and political persuasions unite only in their
respect for an individual who has amassed a substantial financial fortune.
On this occasion they were scarcely less united in their astonishment that
Mr Hariri, having achieved so much, should put himself at risk for the sake
of his country.
It proved to be one of those rare moments in Lebanese history when an
inexplicable event was taken as a positive harbinger. The exchange rate of
the Lebanese pound against the dollar jumped from 2,205 on the day before
his appointment to 1,820 at the turn of the year and now appears fairly
stable in the 1,700-1,750 range.
For Lebanese there is no more important gauge of confidence in the future of
the country than the exchange rate, particularly as many remember with
nostalgia the pound trading at less than five to the dollar during the
darkest days of the civil war. It is also one of the very few economic
statistics which is accurate and immediately available.
The maintenance of the pound's stability despite lack of improvement in
other economic indicators was also significant. Earlier this year several
hundred million dollars of precious non-gold reserves were used to support
the currency, but officials say that the expenditure has since been recouped
and reserves stand again at just below Dollars 1.4bn. Lebanon also holds
more than 9m ounces of gold, which are effectively frozen by parliamentary
legislation and therefore cannot be effectively deployed.
In the absence of dramatic external events, maintaining the currency's
stability will rest on the government's success in tackling a formidable
array of problems.
The war left Lebanon with only the remnants of a civil administration, up to
900,000 displaced people, more than 150,000 disabled, nearly 30 per cent of
the workforce unemployed, pervasive underemployment for those in work,
inflation last year at close to 120 per cent, an alarming budget deficit, a
severely damaged infrastructure, and only sketchy public services.
Deciding on priorities and linking them to the Dollars 13bn reconstruction
programme outlined in the Horizon 2000 document is currently taking much of
the government's time.
Mr Fouad Siniora, the finance minister, has no doubt that the budget deficit
must be tackled first. Considerable progress, he says, is already being
made. During the first five months of this year, the deficit fell by 30 per
cent to about Dollars 360m. If debt servicing is excluded, the improvement
would be closer to 70 per cent, he says.
The main reason for the change has been an increase in revenues, achieved in
large part by improved collection. An important element has been customs
dues which have soared since the government resumed control of most ports.
Improved collection methods should see further large revenue increases,
although widespread evasion will be difficult to overcome. In order to
encourage the payment of income tax, the government is introducing a new law
which will set three levels of 2 per cent, 4 per cent and a top marginal
rate of 10 per cent.
The government's hope is that by setting such modest levels the public will
not risk incurring the increased penalties for evasion. It should also
contribute to attracting back to Lebanon many well-qualified nationals who
inevitably would have to accept lower salary levels than they currently
receive overseas. The return of more of these people will contribute not
only to the level of skills available in the country, but their repatriated
capital will also increase the amounts available to the banking sector
during reconstruction.
Getting a larger number of people to pay realistic prices for essential
services, such as electricity, may be more problematical. At the moment some
hundreds of thousands are believed to tap into the erratic power system
without authorisation. And with many others earning less than the equivalent
of Dollars 150 a month the government has to be very sensitive to the pace
at which it demands payments for its services.
Mr Siniora claims success in sharply reducing inflation this year, an
achievement greeted with scepticism by many Lebanese. Given that Lebanon
imports 70 to 80 per cent of its requirements, the improvement in the
exchange rate over the past seven months should have fed through into lower
consumer prices. However the dominance of a few importers means that the
laws of supply and demand do not fully apply. While some prices have fallen,
it is suspected that other profit margins have increased. Officials hope
that this distortion should eventually disappear as the market in Lebanon
develops.
It is unlikely, however, to ease the increasing demands from all employees,
particularly those in the public sector, for an improvement in pay levels.
The government recognises the need to answer the need, but is wary of its
effect on budget finances and on inflation. With Horizon 2000 demanding an
increased government contribution by the middle of the decade, the political
pressure on the budget will remain intense. Preliminary work is already
underway in reviewing, reorganising and re-equiping the bureaucracy.
Incentives have been offered for government employees to leave their jobs
before an element of compulsion is introduced. Capital expenditure will grow
as ministries introduce computer systems and try to streamline their
operations.
A new Central Bank team, already recognised as one of the best qualified in
the region, is also due to be in place by August. This will signal an
extensive reorganisation and modernising of the bank's activities, an
improvement in economic statistics and a start on planning a proper capital
market, including a stock exchange.
These facilities are urgently needed if Lebanon is to absorb and channel
effectively the heavy capital expenditure forecast in Horizon 2000.
Mr Siniora goes to great lengths to emphasise that in his view the most
effective answer to the dangers of Islamic fundamentalism has to be a steady
improvement in economic and social conditions. Once Arab and western friends
fully understand this, the minister expects them to respond with more
generous contributions to the reconstruction effort.
But ensuring a balanced and equitable distribution of income during the most
intensive part of the rebuilding operation will not be achieved without
closer studies of the population, workforce, education and skill levels that
are available.
Without that information, and a sensitive response to it, some economists
worry that rapid economic development could create additional political
tensions rather than easing those that already exist.

FT  09 JUL 93 / Survey of Lebanon (1): Long road from hell - Reduced to
rubble by 17 years of civil wars and invasion, the former 'Switzerland' of
the Middle East is trying to embark on a process of reconstruction and
national healing / Weighing the chances for Lebanon's blueprint for renewal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROGER MATTHEWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LEBANON is making a brave attempt to rise from the structural and political
rubble left by 17 years of war. Few countries in the Middle East, including
Iraq and Iran, have suffered quite so comprehensively during the past two
decades.
It is also worth recalling that only a few years ago Lebanon was being
written off as a nation. The prognosis then was much like the one for Bosnia
today: fragmentation into a series of mini-states or cantons, each
susceptible to manipulation by an external power, and carrying a legacy of
bitterness that could explode again into conflict at any moment. The
parallel is far from exact, but the efforts being made to reverse the
results of the earlier descent into the chilling process of 'ethnic
cleansing' offer hope that some of the ugliest lessons of the civil war have
been learned.
But that hope has yet to be translated into confidence. The fault lines
between Lebanon's religious minorities remain all too visible, the gulf
between the affluent and the mass of the poor is huge, and the central
government's ability to shape the country's future is severely constrained
by the attitudes of neighbouring countries and by developments elsewhere in
the Middle East.
On the credit side, Lebanon again has a functioning central government, a
legitimately elected if not fully representative parliament, and a
reconstructed army which, under the command of the impressive General Emile
Lahoud, has extended its authority over a large part of the country. The
militias have, with one notable exception, been disarmed and security on the
streets of Beirut is now better than in some large western cities.
Mr Rafik al-Hariri, prime minister for the past seven months, can claim a
large measure of responsibility. His behind the scenes efforts contributed
substantially to the 1989 Taif Agreement which laid the groundwork for the
country's political rehabilitation, and his background as a highly
successful businessman in the Gulf has brought an entrepreneurial drive to
the process of reconstruction.
It is a measure of the hopes resting on him that the currency has
appreciated by 20 per cent against the dollar since he took office and that
over Dollars 1bn has been committed from overseas towards the reconstruction
programme. The cabinet, while still suffering from the inefficiencies
imposed by the need to keep a confessional balance, has generally benefited
from the injection of technocrats with private sector experience. The
central bank, with the arrival soon of a top management team with extensive
international contacts, will provide additional expertise in the handling of
the economy and the revival of a capital market.
Vital work to repair the basic infrastructure, especially electricity, water
and waste disposal, is getting underway. A regular power supply, presently
limited in many areas to six to eight hours a day, will have an immediate
impact on public morale and is fundamental to the more ambitious
reconstruction schemes such as the rebuilding of Beirut's city centre.
The management of the rebuilding programme and its level of priority offer
their own political challenges. Creating a new city centre fit for bankers
to work in has to be balanced against the needs of the poorest section of
society, heavily represented among the 900,000 people uprooted during the
war, many of whom remain without jobs.
Reports that apartments are changing hands in the more fashionable parts of
Beirut for well over Dollars 1m are unlikely to be well received among those
squatting in the bombed out ruins of buildings and getting the minimum wage
of Dollars 90 a month.
Such disparities provide ready ammunition for those domestic and foreign
interests still engaged in the battle over the future political direction of
Lebanon. The most basic shift in influence since the eruption of the civil
war in 1975 has taken place between the Christian and Moslem communities.
Many Christians find it difficult to accept that the demographic changes of
the past 50 years are now reflected in the new constitutional arrangements
in the Taif Agreement.
Mr Hariri, a Sunni Moslem, whose selection as prime minister was vigorously
backed by President Elias Hrawi, the Maronite Christian head of state,
insists that the country can only be governed effectively through the
agreement of the leaders of all the religious minorities.
He hopes that by the time of the next parliamentary elections, in just over
three years time, a new generation of post-war leaders will have emerged to
make reconciliation easier, but that process will in turn be powerfully
influenced by what happens in Syria, Iran, Israel and elsewhere in the
Middle East.
Nothing is more crucial to Lebanon than a successful outcome to the Middle
East peace process. An agreement between Syria and Israel on the Golan
Heights should open the way for both those countries to pull their troops
out of Lebanon. That would remove any justification for Hizbollah, the
radical Shia group, to continue as a separate armed faction outside the
authority of the national army.
Lebanese officials have too little chance of influencing the outcome. Many
cabinet members, whatever their private thoughts, acknowledge that the
Syrian military presence (and political influence) will remain at least
until Israel has left the southern strip of territory it controls and the
Lebanese army has established its authority there. Even after that Syria can
be expected to ensure close political and economic co-operation between the
two countries.
The intentions of Hizbollah are the subject of even more intense debate. As
a radical Islamic organisation which draws its funds and inspiration from
Iran, and is notorious in the west for its involvement in bombings and
kidnappings, Hizbollah appears to be opposed to most things that the Beirut
government is trying to achieve.
Above all, it wants to see an Islamic state imposed in Lebanon, but must
surely understand that the rest of the country, including part of the Shia
community, would literally fight to prevent it. However, Hizbollah, like
Iran, would be emboldened by political successes for radical Islam elsewhere
in the region and is well placed to take advantage of any breakdown in
central authority.
It is a measure of Lebanon's continuing confessional rivalries that there is
as yet little sign of a concerted effort to close ranks and plan how best to
meet the Hizbollah challenge. Many members of the Maronite community are
still more obsessed with getting Syria out of Lebanon, an attitude which has
cost them dear in the past and has simultaneously given Hizbollah the
opportunity to widen its own role.
Given that Syria and Iran still find a common purpose in their hostility
towards Iraq, and Israel has presumably abandoned any thought of again
interfering more fundamentally in Lebanese politics, the options for the
Maronites are few. It is Mr Hariri's hope that eventually they will
recognise that by working within the revised political system their future
prosperity will be better assured.
Part of the problem is that so much of Lebanon's political debate still
takes place behind closed doors and continues to be fed by rumour and
speculation.
The press generally enjoys greater freedom than elsewhere in the Arab world,
but tends to reflect a particular view, while Parliament never discusses the
great issues affecting the country such as the peace process, the treaty
with Syria and the implementation of the Taif Agreement.
These institutions have to be further strengthened in the years ahead if the
country is to lessen its dangerous dependence on individual leaders. Most
Lebanese agree that without the continuing presence of Mr Hariri the
political outlook for Lebanon would be much different, and for most of them
much worse.
He first came to prominence in Saudi Arabia by outbidding international
competition to build the Intercontinental hotel in Taif, and completed the
project in an extraordinary eight months and 15 days. Lebanese are keeping
their fingers crossed that he can perform similar miracles on his home
territory.

FT  09 JUL 93 / The Property Market: A battle to win credit - Turbulence at
Trizec, North America's biggest developer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
All the signals coming from Trizec's head office in Calgary, Alberta,
suggest that North America's biggest publicly traded property developer is
girding for the struggle of its life.
From beefing up the number of independent directors on its board to bringing
in a joint chief executive skilled in public relations, Trizec is working to
win the confidence of employees, shareholders and, most of all, creditors.
The company is due to lift the veil within the next few weeks on
long-awaited proposals to lighten its CDollars 5.3bn (Pounds 2.76bn) debt
burden. At about the same time, it expects to outline a new business plan,
spelling out how resources will be deployed over the next few years in its
three main businesses: shopping centres, office buildings and retirement
communities.
Trizec owns more than 160 properties in the US and Canada covering a total
of 72m square feet of space. Its portfolio is almost double the North
American holdings of Olympia &amp; York, whose collapse last year deepened the
chill in real estate markets across the US and Canada. Trizec's assets
include many prime office blocks in cities from Los Angeles to Atlanta; a
large portfolio of modern shopping centres; and an exposure to the
fast-growing retirement-home market.
The stakes for Trizec are high. 'If it doesn't go through with the
restructuring, it's toast,' says one Toronto real estate financing
specialist.
The recent confidence-building steps are a measure of the turbulence which
has buffeted Trizec. Besides the challenge of finding tenants for its own
properties, it has been caught in the wake of crises at its two biggest
shareholders and its largest subsidiary.
The business empire controlled by the Toronto branch of the Bronfman family
has a 53 per cent voting interest in Trizec through Carena Developments and
other Bronfman holding companies.
Trizec's recent appointment of four new independent directors, combined with
a reduction in the board's size, appears designed to reassure outsiders who
have been concerned about its links with the tangled Bronfman group. 'It's
both a dressing up and represents real change,' one analyst says.
Meanwhile, uncertainty hangs over the 25 per cent equity stake (equal to 8
per cent of the votes) in Trizec nominally held by Olympia &amp; York, the
Toronto-based developer which emerged from court protection earlier this
year a shadow of its former self. O&amp;Y's shares are now controlled by
Citibank and six Japanese banks, to which they were pledged as collateral
for a loan. The bank shareholders are currently examining their options.
Trizec has been called on several times to support Bramalea, a debt-laden
subsidiary which over-extended itself in the California and Ontario housing
markets.
Bramalea earlier this year completed a restructuring of its CDollars 4.5bn
debt. The conversion of a sizeable chunk of the debt to equity has cut
Trizec's interest from 72 per cent to 20 per cent, allowing it to stop
consolidating Bramalea in its books. A writedown of the Bramalea investment
comprised the bulk of Trizec's CDollars 544m loss in 1992.
Trizec is now giving top priority to its own looming cash crunch. Without a
vigorous revival in property markets, its cash flow is inadequate to meet
debt repayments and a CDollars 149m preferred-share redemption due over the
next two years.
Ms Melanie Ward, analyst at RBC Dominion Securities in Toronto, estimated in
a report last December that the company faces a cash shortfall of CDollars
899m in 1994, even after fully drawing down its bank operating lines.
Since then, Ms Ward has cut her cash-flow forecasts further by 24 per cent
for 1993 and 18 per cent next year. (Dominion Securities and Goldman Sachs
are acting as financial advisers to Trizec during the restructuring.)
Trizec is being forced to accept lower rents on many office leases,
totalling 2.2m sq ft, which expire this year. Its latest financial
statements noted that, provided the economy picks up, 'rents should
stabilise in the months ahead, but it will take some time before they are
restored to normal levels'.
One example of the pressures on Trizec is its Bay-Adelaide Centre in
downtown Toronto. The 57-storey office tower was conceived as a flagship
project but is turning out to be a heavy millstone. The property slump has
brought construction to a halt on the 1.6m sq ft centre. Ms Ward estimates
that Trizec has already spent CDollars 250m on its 50 per cent interest in
the project. But more funds are required to re-start work on the tower. In
addition, the biggest tenant signed up so far is in the process of being
taken over, and is likely to require less office space.
Equally problematic for Trizec is its limited options in the forthcoming
debt talks. With its share price languishing at little more than CDollars 1
(down from a peak of CDollars 29 in 1989), raising new equity is out of the
question. Existing shareholders are unlikely to take kindly to another share
issue on the heels of a big private placement in mid-1992 which expanded the
number of Trizec shares by 22 per cent.
Trizec's main bankers, Royal Bank of Canada and Canadian Imperial Bank of
Commerce, are also nervously watching the company's every move. With
property financing in North America still in the doldrums, prospects for
rolling over loans or raising new debt are uncertain.
Nor can Trizec expect gentle treatment from holders of its CDollars 1bn-plus
senior debentures, which observers expect will be at the centre of the
restructuring.
Many of the securities originally placed with public investors are now held
by US 'vulture funds'. These funds and other holders demonstrated their
tenacity earlier this year by extracting big concessions in negotiations
with Bramalea, Trizec's debt-laden subsidiary.
When he unveils the debt plan later this month, Mr Kevin Benson, Trizec's
chairman and joint chief executive officer, is expected to warn debenture
and preferred-share holders that they risk losing everything if they refuse
to extend maturities and accept other sacrifices. The collapse of the
restructuring effort could ripple further afield.
Despite its problems, analysts agree that Trizec's situation is not as
precarious as either O&amp;Y or Bramalea's. Trizec has already made several
moves to improve liquidity, including the elimination of common-share
dividends and the sale of almost all its 25 per cent stake in Rouse Company,
the US shopping-mall developer.
Trizec's assets are not as heavily leveraged as O&amp;Y's. Several hundred
million dollars could still be raised by spinning off part of its wholly
owned Hahn Company, another US shopping centre subsidiary which is widely
regarded as Trizec's crown jewel. Alternatively, Trizec may seek equity
investors in some of Hahn's 48 shopping malls.
Other properties may also be put up for sale, although Trizec's interest in
many of them is a leasehold one rather than the freehold, which is more
attractive to prospective buyers.
'There probably is sufficient value in the assets to cover the liabilities,'
one Toronto analyst says. He predicts that, unlike O&amp;Y, creditors will
eventually accept the argument that Trizec is worth more alive than dead.

FT  09 JUL 93 / City institutions defiant over IRA letter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE, ROLAND RUDD, TIM BURT and CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OVERSEAS financial institu-tions in the City of London reacted defiantly to
yesterday's warning from the IRA of more bombing campaigns in spite of the
creation of the new security zone designed to deter such attacks.
In a letter sent by the IRA to some foreign-owned financial institutions in
the City and published in Republican News, the IRA leadership says: 'No one
should be misled into under-estimating the seriousness of the IRA's
intention to mount future planned attacks in the political and financial
heart of the British state.'
Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Bank, which confirmed that a copy of the letter was sent
to its Bishopsgate offices, which were devastated by a terrorist bomb
earlier this year, said: 'Our record shows we will not be influenced by this
sort of propaganda. We've been in Lebanon since 1982 - something like this
will not make us move out of London.'
Mr Paul Hofer, regional head of Credit Suisse's northern Europe operations,
said: 'We have total trust in the UK authorities. We were back one day after
the last bomb.'
Deutsche Bank yesterday confirmed it had received a letter but declined to
comment.
City of London Police, which confirmed that a number of overseas banks had
received the letters, urged institutions to hand them over for forensic
examination.
Police experts are now studying the copies of the letter sent to Deutsche
Bank and Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Bank.
The Foreign Banks and Securities Houses Association said its members were
putting more emphasis on security and welcomed tougher anti-terrorist
measures such as the road checkpoints.
Mr Ian Mckay, secretary of the association, which represents 150 overseas
institutions, added: 'Our members will not be swayed by this attempt to
destabilise London.'
However, concern at the threat of a City bombing campaign yesterday prompted
a Scandinavian securities house, which asked not to be named, to draw up
contingency plans to leave the Square Mile.
A senior official at the institution said it planned to install dealing room
facilities in a building outside the City.
The IRA's letter says: 'In the context of present political realities,
further attacks on the City of London and elsewhere are inevitable. This we
feel we are bound to convey to you directly, to allow you to make fully
informed decisions.'
No copies of the letter are thought to have been sent to US-owned
institutions as the IRA is anxious not to alienate any republican sympathy
in North America.

FT  09 JUL 93 / Recovery 'hampered' by rising personal debt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PROPORTION of con-sumers getting into debt rose in the second quarter
with households in the south-east suffering the sharpest deterioration in
personal finances, a survey published today shows.
The latest Gallup/Business Strategies regional consumer survey suggests that
spending is still constrained by poor consumer finances.
Mrs Bridget Rosewell, joint managing director of BSL, said: 'With debt
increasing and finances worsening in the south of the country, which is such
a large part of the whole economy, it is hard to imagine how spending will
be able to take off.'
Caution among consumers is bad news for the recovery, BSL said, as 'the
ability and willingness of individuals to buy goods and services is a key
element in producing demand for UK businesses'.
A quarter of respondents said their financial situation had deteriorated
over the last year, a worse result than in the previous quarter and weaker
than a year ago.
Only households in the north of England, Yorkshire and Humberside, East
Anglia and the west Midlands said their financial situation deteriorated
less than it did in the last three months. Greater London, the north-west
and Scotland showed the biggest declines.
BSL says although spending is held back by financial problems, 'there is
little doubt that consumers recognise the improvements to the economy that
are taking place'.
The south-west, the east Midlands and the south-east excluding London are
considerably more optimistic about the next 12 months, while Yorkshire and
Humberside and Wales are less so, reports BSL. Greater London and the
north-west showed no improvement.
Results from a Dun &amp; Bradstreet survey of business confidence show a similar
variation.
The business information company concludes that confidence is continuing to
improve slowly. Two out of three companies surveyed expect sales to improve
compared with a year ago, against just one in six foreseeing a decline.
Manufacturing is the most confident sector with 73 per cent of non-durables
manufacturers forecasting sales increases over last year against 11 per cent
expecting a decline.
Dun &amp; Bradstreet also reports that companies are expecting to take on more
staff. For the second successive quarter more companies forecast rising
employment needs rather than falling needs.

FT  09 JUL 93 / University teachers' union censured on election
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ASSOCIATION of University Teachers will almost certainly have to rerun
the election for its general secretary's post after a finding by the
Certification Office, the official union watchdog, that the election was
improperly conducted.
Mr David Triesman, who took up his post with the 31,000-strong union in
February, beat Dr Peter Borcherds in a ballot last December by just 276
votes.
Following complaints by Dr Borcherds about the conduct of the election, an
internal AUT inquiry discovered that about 500 part-time staff working for
the Open University were probably not sent ballot papers.
Dr Borcherds' complaints were also investigated by the Certification Office,
which yesterday published its findings. It said that 'the AUT failed to
ensure, so far as was reasonably practicable, that every person entitled to
vote in that election was given the opportunity to do so', as required by
law. Two other complaints from Dr Borcherds were rejected.
The Certification Office does not have the power to take the AUT to court,
but its findings could be used to take legal action in an attempt to force
the union to rerun the ballot.
The AUT is taking legal advice but is likely to decide to pre-empt any legal
action by rerunning the ballot.
Mr John Monks, deputy general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, now
seems certain to be elected general secretary at the annual congress in
September. Nominations do not close until July 19, but Mr Monks - who would
take over from Mr Norman Willis - has already secured more than half the
nominations from unions for the post.

FT  09 JUL 93 / Report on WDA highlights conflict of roles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM, Wales and West Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DAMNING report yesterday by the Commons public accounts committee on the
management of the Welsh Development Agency highlights a potential conflict
in its role: to be a fully accountable public body, while seeking to promote
Wales and attract inward investment with entrepreneurial flair.
The appointment in 1988 of the young businessman Dr Gwyn Jones - who was
chairman until last week and for much of the period covered by the MPs'
report - put the emphasis on the latter.
Dr Jones, now aged 44, flew around the world to encourage leading world
companies to set up plants in the principality. There are 45 Japanese
companies with plants in the principality and the present chairman, Mr David
Rowe-Beddoe, yesterday praised the 'enormous achievement' of the WDA in
winning inward investment.
At the WDA's headquarters in Cardiff the Jones style seemed to hold too much
sway for what is a public body funded by the taxpayer and accountable to
parliament. While the chairman's strong personality was admired by many, he
was not regarded as a man with whom his subordinates would wish to argue.
Perhaps partly in consequence, the internal management, headed since early
1991 by Mr Philip Head as chief executive, appeared insufficiently able to
exercise what might have been regarded as bureaucratic controls.
Neither the Welsh Office nor the government-appointed non-executive
directors were effective in stamping out the practices condemned by the MPs.
But the climate has changed at the Welsh Office with the appointment of Mr
John Redwood as Welsh secretary and the imminent arrival of a new permanent
secretary from the Treasury.
Mr Redwood said yesterday that the government would make its full response
to the criticisms of the public accounts committee later this year. The
investigation by the public accounts committee, chaired by Mr Robert
Sheldon, Labour MP for Ashton under Lyne, had itself followed concerns
raised by the National Audit Office on the WDA's 1991-92 accounts.
The committee's main criticisms are:
The agency failed to follow a 'clear legal requirement' to seek Welsh Office
approval for a redundancy scheme between 1989 and 1992 which led to an
overpayment of Pounds 1.4m. The Welsh Office is criticised for providing
grant for the scheme without realising that approval had not been sought.
The MPs accuse the agency of seeking to buy the silence of its international
director Mr Michael Price, who left in February 1992 with an early
retirement package valued by the committee at over Pounds 228,000.
They are also concerned by Operation Wizard, in which fees of Pounds 308,000
were paid to consultants over three years to consider possible
privatisation. The MPs say there might have been a deliberate attempt by the
agency to conceal the costs by spreading them under several headings in its
accounts.
The committee is also disturbed by the appointment in 1989 of an American,
Mr Raymond Carignan, as a consultant to lead the agency's US operations. As
a result of what are described as inadequate contractual and supervisory
arrangements, Mr Carignan departed in 1991 with office furniture and
equipment which had cost Pounds 53,000.
An even more unfortunate appointment in 1991 was that of a marketing
director, Mr Neil Smith, a fraudster whose bogus credentials were not
checked. Mr Smith is in prison. 'He was able to breach internal financial
regulations,' the report says.
The MPs also criticise the agency's failure to seek Welsh Office approval in
1984 for allowing senior officials to have free petrol for their private
use. This scheme was stopped in April last year.
The MPs, referring to 'the high standards expected of those who handle
public finance', recommend that the Treasury and the Welsh Office 'take
urgent steps to ensure that problems similar to those covered by this report
do not recur, and that the lessons which have been learned are notified to
and applied by all non-departmental public bodies'.

FT  09 JUL 93 / British Coal staff cuts confirmed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH COAL has confirmed that it is to shed 3,000 white-collar jobs as it
continues its struggle to reduce costs.
Mr Neil Clarke, chairman, said yesterday that the cuts were essential if
collieries that were still in operation after the recent round of closures
were to win coal sales.
Under a restructuring plan the five operational groups will be reduced to
just two, and opencast mining operations will be streamlined. The plan
includes changes to the organisation of marketing, finance, operations,
information, and technology. Many in-house services are to be outsourced.
British Coal said trade unions would be fully consulted about the
restructuring. It hopes to achieve staff reductions by voluntary redundancy
where possible.
The 3000 jobs are out of a total 5,500 under review in white-collar
departments.
British Coal hopes to put the main elements of the new structure in place by
September-October and have it complete by March-April 1994.
Mr Martin O'Neill, Labour's energy spokesman, said: 'These job losses are
the first indication of the knock-on effect of the pit closure programme and
are part of a wider acceleration of the run-down of the industry in the mad
dash for privatisation.' British Coal is seeking private operators for the
last five of the 19 collieries it no longer wants to keep open. These are
Shirebrook in Nottinghamshire, Taff Merthyr in Mid Glamorgan, Coventry,
Merseyside's Parkside and Sharlston in West Yorkshire. Advertisements will
be appearing in the national press.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SATELLITE television channels have lost viewing share to the traditional
broadcasters in homes with satellite dishes.
The surprising finding comes from the latest analysis by BARB, the official
body that measures television ratings. BARB found that over the year to May
average weekly viewing in satellite homes increased by 73 minutes to a total
of 25 hours 11 minutes. Nearly all the increase - 66 minutes - was accounted
for by viewing channels such as ITV or BBC 1.
Total viewing on BSkyB - in which Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, has
a significant stake - fell by 8 minutes over the year to 5 hours 13 minutes.
The BSkyB audience share fell by 1.5 per cent.

FT  09 JUL 93 / Clowes theft appeal fails

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR PETER CLOWES, the former financier jailed for stealing investors' funds
from his Barlow Clowes investment empire, yesterday lost his appeal against
10 convictions for theft, John Mason writes.
The Court of Appeal also rejected Mr Clowes's appeal against the length of
the 10-year sentence.
Mr Clowes' argument that he was not guilty of theft because investors had
signed a mandate giving the company absolute discretion over the handling of
their money was rejected by three judges.
Mr Clowes is considering whether to ask for leave to appeal to the House of
Lords.
An appeal against conviction by Mr Clowes's second-in-command, Dr Peter
Naylor, was also dismissed.

FT  09 JUL 93 / Patten shakes up vocational exams
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD and JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN PATTEN, education secretary, yesterday re-launched vocational
qualifications in a move to boost their image.
He said that General National Vocational Qualifications were to be renamed,
with the top GNVQ to be known as the vocational A-level.
GNVQs are a third qualification option for people over 16 - after A-levels
and the more specialised National Vocational Qualifications (NVQs).
The most advanced GNVQ - which had been called Level 3 and is the vocational
equivalent of two A-levels - will now be known as 'advanced'. The Level 2
GNVQ - equivalent to four or five GCSEs - will be called 'intermediate' and
the Level 1 GNVQ, equivalent to four lower-grade GCSEs, will be known as
'foundation'.
Mr Patten said the term 'vocational A-level' would help show that the
qualification was equivalent to academic exams, traditionally held in higher
regard.
Sir Bryan Nicholson, chairman of the Confederation of British Industry's
education panel, said the move was a step in the right direction.
'The term A-level is well established and recognised by employers,' he said.
'By using it to describe an equivalent vocational qualification, parents,
students and employers will be able readily to recognise qualifications with
high standards.'
The National Association of Head Teachers was more guarded, describing the
move as a 'small step in the right direction'.
Sir Ron Dearing, chairman-designate of the Schools Curriculum and Assessment
Authority, also welcomed the move. He said that parents had not understood
the range of qualifications available beyond GCSEs and A levels.
Mr Tim Boswell, minister for further and higher education, yesterday told
directors of Training and Enterprise Councils that they had to show by their
actions that they valued vocational qualifications.
'They represent a new currency for jobs for young people and adults alike,'
he said. 'But only if employers use them and shout loudly to would-be
employees, parents, young people and teachers about their value.'
He said the driving force for change was the need for international
competitiveness.

A DESK made in 1812 for the Marquess of Anglesey, a hero of the Battle of
Waterloo, sold for Pounds 1.76m at Christie's yesterday - an auction record
for English furniture.
The marquess lost a leg when he led the cavalry as second in command to the
Duke of Wellington at Waterloo.
The Regency mahogany desk is monumental in size and highly crafted with
bronze enrichments and ebony and brass inlay. It was sold by the executors
of the late Sir John Musker, and had been estimated at between Pounds
400,000 and Pounds 600,000.
Sotheby's is to hold a series of sales in October disposing of treasures
from Schloss St Emmeram, Bavaria, the family seat of the princes von Thurn
und Taxis. The sales are expected to raise about Pounds 5.6m.

FT  09 JUL 93 / Revenue 'key to Nadir probe'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR MICHAEL ALLCOCK, the Inland Revenue investigator alleged by Mr Michael
Mates, former Northern Ireland minister, to have first blown the whistle on
Mr Asil Nadir by tipping off the Stock Exchange, has given his first
detailed account of the close links he says he cultivated with the Stock
Exchange.
He told the Financial Times that he had close contacts with the Stock
Exchange's surveillance unit for nearly 10 years, and that without the help
of the Revenue the complex transactions involving Swiss companies could not
have been penetrated.
Mr Allcock was the head of SO-2, the Revenue's crack investigative unit. In
that capacity he investigated the personal tax affairs of Mr Asil Nadir, the
former chairman of Polly Peck International, who fled to northern Cyprus to
escape trial on charges of theft and fraud. Mr Allcock was suspended on full
pay after allegations of bribery last autumn.
Mr Allcock said SO-2 had been given a loose rein by the Revenue. 'You were
expected to use your initiative . . . my specific area was the Stock
Exchange.'
According to Mr Allcock strong informal links were built up between SO-2 and
the Stock Exchange's surveillance unit specialising in insider-dealing
investigations from 1984 onwards.
'I became a very close friend with a number of individuals working for the
Stock Exchange . . . We regularly met for lunch or a beer. We took turns to
entertain each other and as a result I was given a lot of information and
documents about various individuals, brokers and transactions ranging from
multi-file share applications on government issues to share dealings in tax
haven companies'.
The Stock Exchange has indicated that the SFO's raids on Mr Nadir's offices
was based on information gathered over several years.
But Mr Allcock claims that the Stock Exchange 'for political reasons' is
trying to downplay the strong links between the two agencies.
He said how he first became involved in the Nadir case. 'The first I knew
that the Swiss companies had something to do with Nadir was when a broker
identified one of the companies as being linked to Nadir. The broker had met
Nadir's son Birol on a number of occasions.'
The information was linked to the activities of various Geneva-based
companies which SO-2 subsequently discovered to be linked to Polly Peck
share dealings.
'The Stock Exchange investigators worked with me with open arms . . . They
knew that their investigative powers were very limited . . . the
self-regulatory powers were a joke. They gave us sheets and sheets of
information on various trading transactions involving Swiss companies . . .
The Exchange built up a portfolio but never managed to get behind the
companies.'
According to Mr Allcock, SO-2 discovered that many of the transactions
linked to Mr Nadir's business empire were cleared through the bank accounts
of Turkish students working in London.
Mr Allcock emphasised that the information exchanged between SO-2 and the
Stock Exchange had 'nothing to do with Mr Nadir's personal tax affairs'.
While Mr Allcock insisted he had never passed information directly to the
SFO on the Nadir case, it is understood that there was co-operation on other
cases.
Mr Allcock confirmed that two days after the SFO raid on South Audley
Management, a property management company that handled the Nadir family's
private affairs, he and his colleague Mr Richard Cook attended a meeting at
Vizards, then Mr Nadir's solicitors.
He said he and Mr Cook had been anxious to reassure Vizards that SO-2 was
not leaking information to the SFO, as had been alleged to Mr Allcock by
Coopers &amp; Lybrand, Mr Nadir's accountants, who had threatened to cease all
further co-operation with the Revenue on identifying Mr Nadir's personal tax
affairs.
'The SFO raid was a monumental disaster from a Revenue point of view as the
publicity provoked a share price collapse and undermined attempts to get
more tax owed to us back from Mr Nadir.'
Until then SO-2 is understood to have succeeded in obtaining 'substantial
sums of corporate and personal tax owed by Nadir'.
Sources involved in the SFO raid at the time insist that large sums of
illegally obtained funds were unaccounted for by the Stock Exchange, the
Revenue, and the SFO at the time and are still unaccounted for.
During a taped interview last autumn with officials of the Board's
Investigation Office, the Revenue's disciplinary committee, Mr Allcock was
shown a copy of an agenda of a meeting to be held between himself, an Iraqi
businessman and an accountant. At the bottom of the memo were handwritten
the words 'pay off Pounds 25'.
Mr Allcock said: 'I was asked what the 'pay off' meant. I was quite hurt. I
said couldn't answer it, it had nothing to do with me . . . I have never
been offered bribes, nor have I ever sought them.'

FT  09 JUL 93 / Polly Peck bankers given apology
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ADMINISTRATORS to Polly Peck International have apologised to the
Central Bank of the Turkish Republic of northern Cyprus, in a move that may
boost co-operation with the authorities in realising assets in the region.
Mr Christopher Morris of Touche Ross, one of the administrators, has
withdrawn allegations made during litigation against the bank launched in
October 1991 to recover up to Pounds 45m in Polly Peck funds. He has agreed
to pay legal costs believed to be about Pounds 800,000.
Mr Morris said: 'On the basis of evidence put forward . . . it is now
accepted that there is no foundation for the complaints against the Central
Bank in connection with the disappearance of funds from Polly Peck
International.
'Christopher Morris . . . accordingly apologises to the governor and the
board of the Central Bank for the allegations of fraud and money laundering
which were made in the course of the proceed-ings.'
The apology is likely to ease relations with the authorities of northern
Cyprus, whose co-operation is essential in negotiations over sales of local
PPI subsidiaries.
Mr David Janney, a partner in Theodore Goddard, lawyers for the bank, said
yesterday: 'On behalf of the governor of the Central Bank, I want to say we
are grateful to Mr Morris for making the statement.'
PPI funds passed through the bank's account in London, totalling Pounds 3.6m
in 1988, Pounds 17.6m in 1989 and Pounds 22.5m in 1990. But two of three
Appeal Court judges threw out the administrators' case on the grounds of
insufficient evidence.

FT  09 JUL 93 / Confused recovery picture in north
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
COMPANIES in the north are confused about economic recovery, with no
consistent pattern of improvement yet apparent, according to the Yorkshire

THE government's campaign to have the European Medicines Evaluation Agency
based in London received a boost yesterday when the Medicines Control Agency
said a third of all new applications for drug licences in the European
Community were being handled in the UK.
Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health secretary, said the strengths of the UK
medicines regulatory system - its scientific excellence, speedy and
efficient licensing and commitment to protecting public health - were
evident.

FT  09 JUL 93 / Electricity suppliers face tougher pricing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TOUGHER controls on electricity prices will be announced today by Professor
Stephen Littlechild, the electricity regulator.
The controls will apply to the electricity supply business, which accounts
for as much as 20 per cent of the profits of the regional electricity
companies. The controls form the first part of a two-year review which will
eventually cover the entire electricity supply and distribution business.
Today's 64-page report is expected to give the regional electricity
companies more flexibility in calculating the costs they can pass on to
customers, for example by taking account of market features such as the size
and distribution of the population.
But Prof Littlechild is also expected to introduce an 'X factor'.
This would be subtracted from the inflation rate to give the amount by which
electricity prices could rise in any year.
In their recently announced results many electricity companies said they had
launched a vigorous attack on costs in order to be in a better position to
absorb the effect of tighter regulatory controls.
Today's report will be a prelude to a much larger review of the distribution
business lasting until next summer.

FT  09 JUL 93 / Bayer attacks attempts to cut NHS drug bill
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BAYER UK, the subsidiary of the German chemicals group, yesterday attacked
the government's proposed system to control the growing National Health
Service drugs bill.
Mr Klaus Behrendt, director of UK pharmaceuticals at Bayer, said the system
was worse than anything on the Continent.
'The British have a reputation for fair play, but this system is not
transparent. We have no idea what the rules are,' he said.
The health service drugs bill was Pounds 3.4bn last year. According to IMS
International, market researchers, spending on drugs in the UK increased by
11 per cent in the first four months of this year compared with the same
period last year.
Mr Behrendt specifically criticised the decision to extend the blacklist of
products which the health service will no longer provide.
The extension, announced last November, involves 10 medicine categories
including contraceptives, topical anti-rheumatics, treatments for vaginal
and vulval conditions, and for skin diseases. About 625 products could be
affected.
A committee of experts set up to decide which treatments should go on the
lists is telling drug companies its first recommendations.
Mr Behrendt said the cheapest rather than most effective or safe remedies
were being recommended by the committee. However, companies were being told
their more expensive products would be used by the health service if prices
were cut to the same level as the cheapest product.
Mr Behrendt said: 'The government has, in effect, introduced a system of
reference pricing (paying for a drug at the price of the cheapest product in
its area) through the back-door. This is very unfair. If innovative products
can no longer create a premium, there is little point launching new products
on the market.'
The Department of Health said yesterday that limited lists were introduced
to make sure effective and cost-effective medicines were used by the health
service. However, it is understood that sections of the department are in
favour of reference pricing systems.
Mr Behrendt said: 'Most companies in the UK are not complaining because they
aren't affected. But once the system is in place it could be extended to
cover all medicines. The industry, which is highly fragmented, must tackle
the issue. The whole sector could be affected if there are further
extensions in the future.'
Up to 18 per cent of Bayer UK's pharmaceuticals turnover comes from
Canestan, a product which could be included on the blacklist.

FT  09 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: TGWU rounds on Labour reform plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS and DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR BILL MORRIS, general secretary of the Transport and General Workers'
Union, yesterday launched a strong attack on Labour's front bench as the
TGWU's biennial conference voted to reject the Labour leadership's plans for
reforms of internal party democracy.
Delegates gave Mr Morris a standing ovation as he warned those in the Labour
party who wanted to introduce the principle of one member one vote that 'we
will not be moved'. Mr Morris added: 'We are not turkeys and we are not
going to vote for Christmas.'
Meanwhile, in the Commons yesterday, some Tories taunted Mr John Smith, the
Labour leader, over the opposition to reforms he faced from the unions.
Mr Tony Newton, Leader of the House, said Mr Smith's attempts to persuade
the unions of his plans had been a 'catastrophe'.
But Mr Smith's aides said the Labour leader 'stood by every word' of the
speech he made to the TGWU conference in Bournemouth on Wednesday when he
called for the relationship between Labour and the unions to be
'modernised'.
The stage is now set for a battle on union-Labour links at this autumn's
Labour party conference.
Only the AEU engineering union and the ISTC steel union positively support
the Labour leader on the key issue of removing unions from the selection of
local candidates.
With a few other small unions probably backing the leader that might amount
to 15 per cent out of the 70 per cent of the votes allocated to the unions
at the conference.
Combined with about 65 per cent of the constituency parties - who together
account for 30 per cent of the total vote - supporters of Mr Smith's plan
for one-member-one-vote command no more than one-third of the conference
votes.
Some of the opponents of the the Labour leader's plan are seen as potential
waverers. The conference delegations from three out of the big six unions
affiliated to the party - Nupe the public service union, Usdaw the
shopworkers and MSF the white collar union - could, it is believed, be
persuaded to shift position to support one-member-one-vote.

FT  09 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Curb set on use of Lloyd's reserves
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT is to amend the Finance Bill to ensure withdrawals by Lloyd's
Names from new tax-free reserves may be made only to fund losses.
Though this was always the government's intention, Labour had criticised the
original proposals for failing to set explicit restrictions on the
circumstances in which withdrawals could be made.
Labour yesterday welcomed the government's amendment - tabled ahead of
Monday's Commons report stage - saying it was exactly what it had been
arguing for.
The move followed undertakings by ministers in committee stage to
incorporate the suggested change if a 'legitimate' way could be found of
doing so.
The arrangements set out in the Budget do nothing to help Names on the
troubled insurance market who have already been hit by heavy losses. But
they will allow them to establish tax-free reserves against heavy losses
they may incur in the future.
Under the new arrangements - which come into in effect to cover the 1992
underwriting year - Names will be able to transfer up to 50 per cent of
profits to the new reserve each year, provided the value of the funds in the
reserve does not exceed 50 per cent of the Name's overall premium income
limit.
Amounts withdrawn will be made to fund losses or cash calls. Withdrawals not
used to meet losses will attract tax.

FT  09 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: MPs urge move on Maxwell funds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MPS FROM both sides of the House of Commons last night urged the government
to ensure that leading City institutions which undertook commissions for the
late Robert Maxwell contributed to the restoration of the pension funds he
plundered.
Mr Frank Field (Lab Birkenhead), chairman of the Commons social security
committee, suggested appropriate sums paid on a voluntary basis might enable
some 'grand City institutions' to avoid having their reputations fatally
flawed in legal pro-ceedings.
He was strongly supported by Mr David Shaw (C Dover), another member of the
committee, who envisaged the largest contribution being in the region of
Pounds 100m.
Mr Shaw argued that directors and other individuals associated with Maxwell
companies who had been paid large sums to remain silent should be asked for
smaller contributions of around Pounds 50,000.
He was particularly critical of the investment bank Goldman Sachs, claiming
that the company must have known that Maxwell was a desperate man involved
in strange deals.
Both Mr Field and Mr Shaw praised the government for the action it had taken
to mitigate the hardship suffered by the members of Maxwell pension funds
but insisted that tax-payers should not be asked to shoulder the burden of
restitution.

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR last night faced further grim evidence that support for the
Conservatives continues to fall, as an opinion poll showed them in third
place behind Labour and the Liberal Democrats, Ralph Atkins writes.
As Sir Norman Fowler, Conservative chairman, prepared to launch today the
party's campaign in the Christchurch by-election, a Gallup survey for The
Daily Telegraph showed another fall in the prime minister's rating.
The Tories' slide into third place was reminiscent of the party's worst
years in the early 1980s, when the now-defunct Liberal-Social Democratic
Alliance was at its height.
The Gallup poll puts the Conservatives on 24.5 per cent, the Liberal
Democrats on 26.5 per cent and Labour on 43 per cent.
Mr Major's personal rating is 18.4 per cent, the lowest recorded by Gallup
for a prime minister. Asked about Mr Major's qualities, 85 per cent of those
polled said he was 'not really in charge' and 77 per cent said he was
'indecisive'.

LABOUR must champion a new relationship between society and the individual
which embraces public intervention but safeguards individual freedoms, Mr
Tony Blair, shadow home secretary, said last night, Michael Cassell writes.
Mr Blair said the party must grasp the ideological initiative and provide a
lead for a country which had lost its sense of purpose and direction.
Giving the tenth Arnold Goodman charity lecture, Mr Blair said he wanted to
see 'a new concept of citizenship in which rights and responsibilities go
together and where we cease to posit an entirely false choice between social
and personal responsibility'.
The purpose of economic and social policy, he said, should be to extend
opportunity, remove the underlying causes of social alienation and also take
tough measures to ensure that chances extended to people were taken up.

LABOUR MUST champion a new relationship between society and the individual
which embraces public intervention but safeguards individual freedoms, Mr
Tony Blair, shadow home secretary, said last night.
Mr Blair, in a lecture intended to help shape a clear identity and new
agenda for Labour, said the party had the opportunity to grasp the
ideological initiative and provide a lead for a country which had lost its
sense of purpose and direction.
Giving the tenth Arnold Goodman charity lecture in London, Mr Blair set out
'new principles' by which British society should be governed and the ways in
which Labour should embody them.
In calling for the adoption of 'enduring, lasting principles applied for a
new generation', he rejected the public versus private sector battle,
claiming the left had undervalued individual responsibility while the right
had ignored the influence of social conditions.
Mr Blair said he wanted to see 'a new concept of citizenship in which rights
and responsibilities go together and where we cease to posit an entirely
false choice between social and personal responsibility'.
The purpose of economic and social policy, he said, should be to extend
opportunity, remove the underlying causes of social alienation and also take
tough measures to ensure that the chances extended to people were taken up.
Outlining new principles of public intervention and action, he called for
the creation of 'a genuine partnership between public and private sector',
the purpose of which would be to intervene to enhance individual economic
opportunity and rebuild the country's economic base.

FT  09 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Senior Tories call for more oil tax
concessions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SENIOR TORY backbenchers are putting the government under renewed pressure
to make further concessions over its proposed changes to North Sea oil
taxes.
Six Conservative MPs last night tabled a group of amendments calling for a
three-year transition period before the changes take full effect.
The amendments may be considered when the Finance Bill returns to the
Commons for its report stage next Monday.
The move followed a 90-minute meeting at the Treasury involving three of the
MPs, industry representatives and Mr Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary to
the Treasury.
One of the backbenchers - Mr John Butterfill, Conservative MP for
Bournemouth West - said that Mr Dorrell had listened to the group's
arguments very carefully.
Treasury officials said last night that the new proposals would be
considered but that the government was unlikely to allow further
concessions.
The additional amendments were welcomed by members of the oil industry last
night. One large North Sea oil company said the new terms would encourage
more sustained activity during the transition to the new tax regime.
The renewed initiative comes less than a month after the government bowed to
pressure by agreeing to extend some short-term help to companies worst
affected by the changes, by making it easier for them to claim the Pounds
200m earmarked in the Budget for this purpose.
The amendment committed the government to allowing companies to claim up to
Pounds 10m each until the end of next year for exploration work affected by
the abolition of tax relief.
Under the Budget changes, the rate of petroleum revenue tax (PRT) paid on
existing fields would be reduced from 75 per cent to 50 per cent, while
relief for exploration work would be abolished.
Mr John Watts, Tory MP for Slough, said last night: 'If we had a three-year
transition period as we have proposed, we could maintain a higher level of
activity in the North Sea, the rundown of activity would be more orderly and
there would be less loss of jobs.'

FT  09 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Lilley seeks broad debate on rise
in social security spending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN and MICHAEL CASSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOCIAL SECURITY spending is set to increase 19 per cent in real terms by
2000 even if unemployment falls by a quarter, according to projections
released yesterday by Mr Peter Lilley, the social security secretary.
The projections are included in a compendium of statistics published by Mr
Lilley to stimulate debate on the growth of social security spending, which
last year cost Pounds 74bn.
The publication of the figures immediately led Mr John Smith, the Labour
leader, to accuse ministers of 'softening up' the public for big social
security budget reductions.
The Labour leader highlighted remarks made in Tokyo on Wednesday by the
prime minister, that the UK, with other Group of Seven nations, would have
to take unpopular but necessary steps to keep social security budgets in
check.
As Mr Lilley is fond of pointing out, however, the Labour party has itself
recognised the need for a detailed review of the social security budget in
setting up its own social justice commission.
Mr Lilley said yesterday: 'We need an informed public debate on the reform
of social security to ensure that it becomes a better, more focused system
which protects the most needy and vulnerable in our society without
outstripping the nation's ability to pay.'
If there were no fall in unemployment between now and the end of the century
the social security bill would reach Pounds 93m by 2000. The proportion of
GDP it would swallow would rise from 12.3 per cent to 13.5 per cent.
However, economic growth would do much to reduce the scale of the problem.
If unemployment fell by a quarter the social security bill would rise to
Pounds 88bn, a real increase of 2.6 per cent a year. If unemployment were
halved social security spending would fall as a percentage of GDP.
A third of the increase in social security in the next seven years will come
from sickness, invalidity and disability benefits. A quarter will come from
housing benefit and a fifth from payments to one-parent families.
Most of the rest comes from the build-up of state earnings related pensions.
Steps have been proposed to curb the growth of invalidity benefit by
imposing tougher medical tests. A cross-departmental review led by the
Downing Street policy unit is examining housing benefit as part of a review
of housing policy.
Mr Lilley expressed contentment yesterday over the emerging debate on the
increase in one-parent families. While there are no plans to cut their
benefits, he believes that a debate could help in changing attitudes which
have encouraged the increase.
However, Mr Smith's attack in the Commons yesterday gave notice of the
opposition's intention to harry the government on the social security issue
in the weeks running up to the Christchurch by-election on July 29.
Conservative MPs fear that a Labour onslaught intended to show pensions are
under threat could prove electorally damaging in what already promises to be
a hard-fought contest.
Short-term political considerations could make it difficult for Mr Lilley to
launch the long-term debate he wants.

FT  09 JUL 93 / Gerrymander charges mar Tory scheme: Claims of bias in
redefining local authorities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT'S reform of local government in Scotland could well produce a
more efficient, comprehensible structure than that which exists.
But while there was rejoicing in several parts of Scotland that some old
authorities are to be recreated, the exercise could be marred by a
widespread perception that the Conservatives have drawn up many of the
boundaries to suit their own party interests.
The government argues that a move from the two-tier structure of nine
regions and 53 district councils (plus three unitary island authorities) is
justified because many people are confused about what functions are catered
for by the regions and what comes under the districts. Many still talk of
living in Ayrshire or Perthshire - although officially these areas no longer
exist.
Some dispassionate observers of Scottish local government argue that after
the contracting out of many council services it has become a democratic
necessity for communities to have a single, easily identified council.
But they find it difficult to avoid a political interpretation of what the
government is doing in Scotland. Unlike in England there was no independent
commission to decide the new boundaries.
A consultant involved in the process said: 'The government's paramount aim
in this reform was to abolish Strathclyde. The Scottish Office found it
irritatingly independent. For the Conservatives it was irredeemably Labour.'
Lothian region, which includes and surrounds Edinburgh, has also long been
in Tory sights as an irritant. But its size is modest compared with
Strathclyde.
It is in the detail of the new map that the government is vulnerable to the
charge of gerrymandering. Professor Alan Alexander of Strathclyde University
said: 'I know of no local government reform in which the government does not
protect its own territory. But there are some highly questionable things
here.'
He pointed to the disparities in population among the new councils, with
those that might be expected to come under Tory control being much smaller
than adjoining units likely to go to Labour.
'It looks like the kind of gerrymandering they did when they drew up the
borders of the US,' he said. 'You herd all your enemies into a corner.'
It is possible, he thought, that after 1996 Labour would cease to dominate
the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities, which represents local
government to the Scottish Office.
'After reorganisation there may be only 12 Labour-controlled councils,' he
said. 'They could be outnumbered by a combination of Tory-held authorities
and the rural areas which are not organised on party political lines. Yet
the number of people living in Labour-held councils may well outnumber the
rest.'
On the future of Scotland's water industry, the government has deflated the
opposition by saying that the ownership and operation of water services will
remain in the public sector, under three new authorities. Currently water is
in the hands of the nine regions and three island authorities.
Tremendous opposition had built up to the idea of privatising water in
Scotland and even the franchising of services to the private sector was
unpopular. There was talk of refusing to pay water bills, civil
disobedience, even sabotage.
Scottish Conservatives are almost as strongly opposed to privatisation as
the opposition parties. An opinion poll in May showed only 2 per cent of
those asked favouring privatisation, compared with 95 per cent who opposed
it.
The government has avoided controversy for now by leaving the issue shrouded
in generalisations.

Service drugs bill.
Mr Klaus Behrendt, director of UK pharmaceuticals at Bayer, said the system
was worse than anything in the rest of Europe. He added: 'The British have a
reputation for fair play, but this system is not transparent. We have no
idea what the rules are.'
The health service drugs bill was Pounds 3.4bn last year. According to IMS
International, market researchers, spending on drugs in the UK increased by
11 per cent in the first four months of this year compared with the same
period last year.
Mr Behrendt criticised the decision to extend the blacklist of products
which the health service will no longer provide. About 625 products could be
affected and the first recommendations of a committee set up to decide which
treatments should go on the list have been sent to drug companies.
Mr Behrendt said the cheapest rather than most effective or safe remedies
were being recommended by the committee. However, companies were being told
their more expensive products would be used by the health service if prices
were cut to the same level as the cheapest product.
Mr Behrendt said: 'The government has, in effect, introduced a system of
reference pricing (paying for a drug at the price of the cheapest product in
its area) through the back-door. This is very unfair. If innovative products
can no longer create a premium, there is little point launching new products
on the market.'
The Department of Health said yesterday that limited lists were introduced
to make sure effective and cost-effective medicines were used by the health
service. However, it is understood that sections of the department are in
favour of reference pricing systems.
Mr Behrendt said: 'Most companies in the UK are not complaining because they
aren't affected. But once the system is in place it could be extended to
cover all medicines. The industry, which is highly fragmented, must tackle
the issue. The whole sector could be affected if there are further
extensions.'

FT  09 JUL 93 / Radio watchdog warns on sponsors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RADIO Authority, the industry regulatory body, plans to remind
commercial radio stations about the rules on sponsored broadcasts following
a controversial programme of Tina Turner's music.
The one-hour programme was transmitted by satellite last month all over
Europe and was broadcast by 30 independent local stations.
The programme, which contained tracks from Ms Turner's latest album, was put
together by MCM Networking, one of the largest syndicators of music
programmes outside north America. Mr Doug Adamson, managing director of MCM,
which has won a Sony award for its work, acknowledged yesterday that his
company was paid by EMI, Tina Turner's record company, to make and
distribute the programme free to radio stations.
Some ILR stations decided not to use the programme as there was no
acknowledgment of EMI's role. They included Mr Phil Riley, managing director
of Radio Aire, the Leeds commercial radio station. 'There is some cause for
concern about this type of behaviour by Thorn EMI,' he said.

FT  09 JUL 93 / Howard rejects criticism of police authority reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LOCAL authorities did not have a 'monopoly of knowledge' on the way the
police service should be run, Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, said
yesterday.
Mr Howard faced several interruptions as he defended government proposals
for small, more businesslike police authorities to senior police officers
and local authority leaders at the Association of Chief Police Officers'
conference in Birmingham.
Farmers, head teachers and shopkeepers all knew something about crime, Mr
Howard said. Some had been victims of it and all understood the fear of it.
Such people should be able to bring their knowledge to police authorities.
The government, as part of a wide-ranging agenda for police reform, intends
to reduce local authority representation on police authorities, with the
home secretary appointing some members and authority chairs directly. Chief
constables as well as local authorities have attacked the proposals, which
were published in a white paper last month.
Mr Robin Wendt, secretary of the Association of County Councils, told the
conference that the white paper made no attempt to assess the benefits of
different structures and merely asserted that the new system would be
better. 'As a basis for major constitutional change, that simply will not
do,' he said.
Mr John Burrow, chief constable of Essex and president of ACPO, warned Mr
Howard that if he did not allow a genuine dialogue on proposed changes to
the police service 'you run the risk of not taking the main players with
you'.
There appears little likelihood of the government changing its mind over the
reform of police authorities, which mirror changes elsewhere in the public
sector. But Mr Howard told the conference that he had no pre-determined
position on another aspect of the reforms - the Sheehy report on police pay
and responsibilities - although he believed that 'if we can improve the link
between performance and pay we will all be better off'.
He said he would consider responses to the report until September and hoped
to move forward in consultation with the police service.

FT  09 JUL 93 / Scots council reform confirmed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government yesterday confirmed that it is to sweep away Scotland's
two-tier local government structure and replace it with a system of
single-tier authorities.
Mr Ian Lang, Scottish secretary, said that 25 unitary authorities were to be
created in place of the nine regions and 53 districts of mainland Scotland.
The three unitary island councils would be unchanged.
Mr Lang was given a noisy reception when he announced his white paper in the
House of Commons and several opposition Scottish MPs walked out. By the end
of the question and answer session following his statement, Mr Lang was left
addressing a virtually deserted chamber. The greatest impact was achieved by
Labour which left en masse in a carefully stage-managed publicity stunt.
On the controversial question of the possible privatisation of Scotland's
water and sewerage services Mr Lang said he planned to create three 'public
water authorities' to own and operate 'the current water and sewerage
assets'. The new authorities would 'arrange for new investment in ways which
will maximise the involvement of the private sector'. Mr Lang said he would
consult with interested bodies before producing detailed proposals for
legislation.
The new map of local authorities - to be known simply as councils - is
exactly the same as that leaked to The Scotsman newspaper late last week
which provoked fury among the opposition.
Strathclyde region, which includes nearly half the Scottish population, will
disappear and be broken up into 10 councils. The four Scottish cities,
Edinburgh, Glasgow, Aberdeen and Dundee, will become unitary authorities.
Lothian, Tayside, Grampian and Central regions will be broken up. The whole
of the Highlands, consisting of a region and eight districts, will become a
single council. Stirlingshire is among former counties which will reappear.
The new councils will not be of uniform size.
The number of police forces and fire brigades is to remain at eight, but
joint committees of councils will be set up where they cover more than one
area. There will be no joint committees in fields such as education or
social work.
Legislation to create the councils will be introduced in the next session of
parliament. Elections will be held in May 1995 and the new councils will
come into existence in May 1996. There will be elections every three years.
Mr Lang said that savings of about Pounds 200m over five years could be
expected from the new structure. Transitional costs depended on the new
authorities but were estimated at between Pounds 120m and Pounds 196m.
Mr Tom Clarke, the shadow Scottish secretary, called the proposals 'the Tory
revenge on the Scottish people and on Scottish local government'. Sir David
Steel, for the Liberal Democrats, called them 'the most corrupt proposals
that have been presented to the House by any government in my time in the
House'.
Mr Robert Gould and Mrs Jean McFadden, the Labour leaders of Strathclyde
Regional Council and Glasgow District Council respectively, called the
proposals 'an act of political vandalism'.

FT  09 JUL 93 / Hunt outlines industry 'pact'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR DAVID HUNT, employ-ment secretary, yesterday underlined his commitment to
a more interventionist role for the government in setting a framework for
industrial competitiveness.
Speaking at the annual conference of Training and Enterprise Councils
(Tecs), he went further than other ministers to define partnership between
industry and the government.
'Some may see partnership as corporatism by another name,' said Mr Hunt.
'But I do not. Corporatism implies a degree of state influence over the
economy so pervasive that the roles and responsibilities of business and
government get blurred.'
The key foundation for successful partnership was the clearest definition of
the responsibilities of the partners. The role of government, he said, was:
To do that which needed to be done, but which others could not do for
reasons of law or market failure.
To set the framework of standards and institutions to see that they evolved
as the need of the people changed.
To influence attitudes, for example through positive support for enterprise.
Where necessary to remedy market failure through direct intervention and to
organise and co-ordinate strategies to bring inward investment.
Earlier, the Tecs agreed to set up a new national council to replace G10,
the group of 10 chairmen which represents Tec concerns to government.

FT  09 JUL 93 / Council contractors reduce tendering prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMPULSORY competitive tendering has brought fresh savings for councils  -
with bidders cutting their prices when the contracts are renewed, according
to figures published today in the Local Government Chronicle.
The figures contradict the common view that the companies which won
contracts on the first round had treated the exercise as a 'loss-leader'.
Seven of the first eight authorities to renegotiate deals with outside
contractors for refuse collection since the scheme started in 1988 have
achieved real-term price cuts of 18.4 per cent or more.
Councils using private contractors obtained savings varying from a 30 per
cent real reduction for Runnymede district council to 18.4 per cent for
Tonbridge.
Medina district council, in the Isle of Wight, is the only authority so far
to have suffered an increase.
Three contractors - Biffa Waste, Tylers, and Cory Environmental - have so
far won contracts. In Cherwell, in Oxfordshire, the council's own direct
labour force emerged as the lowest bidder with a price Pounds 360,500 lower
than 1988's Pounds 1.2m.
Direct labour organisations, which in most cases beat private sector
competitors when the contracts were first put out to tender, found the
figures alarming.
Mr Mark Bramah, principal adviser to the Association of Direct Labour
Organisations, said previous studies had suggested contract prices would
rise when retendered. He said: 'I find it surprising that they are coming in
cheaper. There may be underlying reasons in each case, such as the impact of
the recession on private sector bids. Local authorities' own resource
problems could also be affecting their specifications.'
Mr Cliff Davis-Coleman, managing director of CDC Research, which produced
the figures, estimated that further contracts to be awarded in the next two
months would confirm that private companies were prepared to offer low
prices in order to gain substantial volume in the UK market.
Dr Stefan Szymanski of the London Business School yesterday told a seminar
on tendering organised by CDC Research, that competitive tendering had
already delivered substantial reductions before the contracts came up for
renewal.
Figures produced independently by Dr Szymanski, which compare the
expenditure on refuse collection declared by 217 local authorities in
England and Wales in 1988 with the amount they paid for contracts, show the
average cost saving is 27 per cent, with a variation in savings from 42 per
cent to 5 per cent.
Dr Szymanski said the cost savings could come from three sources -
efficiency gains, poorer terms and conditions for the labour force, and
reduced quality. However, recent research by the Audit Commission, the local
government spending watchdog, suggested that quality had not been adversely
affected. This led Dr Szymanski to suggest that the savings had come from
the workforce - not generally in lower wages, but in longer working hours
and reduced benefits - and from improved efficiency.
Dr Szymanski's findings are questioned by the Institute of Local Government
Studies at Birmingham University, which, on the basis of a smaller sample of
authorities, believes accrued savings are about 8 per cent since 1988.

FT  09 JUL 93 / PIA plan attacked by Pru chief
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR MICK Newmarch, chief executive of Prudential, Britain's largest life
insurer, said the company would be an 'unwilling' participant in a proposed
new self-regulating body if a current blueprint it was considering is
adopted.
He told the Financial Times Conference on Retail Regulation that a report by
Sir Brian Jenkins, commissioned by the board of the proposed Personal
Investment Authority, far exceeded the remit of a self-regulating body.
Mr Newmarch renewed his call for direct statutory regulation of the
financial services industry and abolition of the self-regulating framework.
He called for a structure similar to that used to regulate building
societies. Regulators needed certain powers now prohibited to them, such as
the ability to ban the sale of inherently flawed products.
After the conference, he said he doubted the PIA would come to fruition and
the Prudential would not participate unless the majority of industry
participants joined on a voluntary basis.
Separately, Mr Andrew Large, chairman of the Securities and Investments
Board, told the conference he had established a joint working party on
disclosure with Fimbra and Lautro, the two self-regulating bodies for retail
financial services.
The working party will consider, among other things, recommendations from
the Office of Fair Trading on disclosure as well as a proposal from Mr Tim
Miller, an SIB consultant, to help consumers understand the costs of the
products they buy.
Mr Large said it was evident the disclosure regime for life insurance
products proposed by the SIB did not go far enough in meeting consumers'
desire for more information.

FT  09 JUL 93 / Tougher controls for power prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TOUGHER controls on electricity prices will be announced today by Professor
Stephen Littlechild, the electricity regulator, David Lascelles writes.
The controls will apply to the electricity supply business, which accounts
for as much as 20 per cent of the profits of the regional electricity
companies. The controls form the first part of a two-year review which will
eventually cover the entire electricity supply and distribution business.
The report is expected to give the regional electricity companies more
flexibility in calculating the costs they can pass on to customers, for
example by taking account of market features such as the size and
distribution of the population.
But Prof Littlechild is also expected to introduce an 'X factor'. This would
be subtracted from the inflation rate to give the amount by which
electricity prices could rise.

FT  09 JUL 93 / Report on WDA highlights a conflict
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM, Wales and West Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DAMNING report yesterday by the Commons public accounts committee on the
management of the Welsh Development Agency highlights a potential conflict
in its role: to be a fully-accountable public body while seeking to promote
Wales and attract inward investment with entrepreneurial flair.
The appointment in 1988 of the businessman Dr Gwyn Jones, who was chairman
until last week and for much of the period covered by the MPs' report, put
the emphasis on the latter. While he flew around the world attracting
business, the internal management, headed since early 1991 by Mr Philip Head
as chief executive, appeared insufficiently willing to exercise what it
might have regarded as bureaucratic controls. Mr Head had succeeded Mr David
Waterstone, who had left the previous summer to work in industry.
Neither the Welsh Office nor the government-appointed non-executive
directors, were effective in stamping out the practices condemned by the
MPs. The investigation by the committee, chaired by Mr Robert Sheldon,
Labour MP for Ashton under Lyne, followed concerns raised by the National
Audit Office on the WDA's 1991-92 accounts.
The committee's main criticisms are:
The agency failed to follow a 'clear legal requirement' to seek Welsh Office
approval for a redundancy scheme between 1989 and 1992, which led to an
overpayment of Pounds 1.4m. The Welsh Office is criticised for providing
grant for the scheme without realising that approval had not been sought.
The MPs accuse the agency of seeking to buy the silence of its international
director Mr Michael Price, who left in February 1992 with an early
retirement package valued by the committee at more than Pounds 228,000.
They are also concerned by Operation Wizard, in which fees of Pounds 308,000
were paid to consultants over three years to consider possible
privatisation. The MPs say there might have been a deliberate attempt by the
agency to conceal the costs by spreading them under several headings in its
accounts.
The committee is also disturbed by the appointment in 1989 of an American,
Mr Raymond Carignan, as a consultant to lead the agency's US operations. As
a result of what are described as inadequate contractual and supervisory
arrangements, Mr Carignan departed in 1991 with office furniture and
equipment which cost Pounds 53,000.
An even more unfortunate appointment in 1991 was that of a marketing
director, Mr Neil Smith, a fraudster whose bogus credentials were not
checked. Mr Smith is now in prison. 'He was able to breach internal
financial regulations, including engaging models for promotional work in an
unacceptable manner,' the report says. Mr Smith held interviews in a hotel
room. The MPs also criticise the agency's failure to seek Welsh Office
approval in 1984 for allowing senior officials to have free petrol for their
private use. This scheme was stopped in April 1992.
Dr Jones is personally criticised for a delay in notifying a change of use
at rural premises for which he had received a grant. 'It is clearly
important,' the report says, 'that circumstances do not arise which can give
cause to any allegations of abuse of position.'
The MPs, referring to 'the high standards expected of those who handle
public finance', recommended that the Treasury and the Welsh Office 'take
urgent steps to ensure that problems similar to those covered by this report
do not recur, and that the lessons which have been learned are notified to
and applied by all non-departmental public bodies.'

FT  09 JUL 93 / Spring prompts ministerial clash on Ulster
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH and Irish ministers clashed publicly over the future of Northern
Ireland last night after the Irish government incensed unionist leaders with
ideas floated for the province's future.
In a scarcely disguised rebuke, Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland
secretary, said he had been 'surprised' by comments made in a newspaper
interview by Mr Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister.
Speaking after a meeting of the Anglo-Irish conference, Sir Patrick said Mr
Spring had apparently gone beyond the 'cardinal principle' that the
constitutional future of Northern Ireland would have to be agreed across the
two communities in the province.
But Mr Spring said that it would be wrong for any option for Northern
Ireland to be ruled out: 'If we are not allowed to put forward provocative
ideas then we may as well all give up.'
He added that if 'round-table' talks on the province's future failed, then
'ultimately responsibility lies with governments and I think that the
governments have to make that quite clear'.
The row reflected growing frustration in London and Dublin at the failure of
the two governments to restart the talks involving Northern Ireland's main
political leaders that collapsed last November. Unionists say that they will
not re-enter until the Irish Republic modifies its constitutional claim on
the north.
Sir Patrick again refused to give up yesterday, saying: 'I don't visualise
this process failing and I'm certainly not planning for it failing or a
course of action if it does.'
However, Mr Spring has raised the possibility of the two governments going
over the heads of local politicians and agreeing a new political framework
for the province, possibility being put to referenda in north and south
Ireland. Options could include joint authority or sovereignty of the
province.
But Mr John Major, the prime minister, and Sir Patrick have firmly rejected
such proposals and yesterday Mr James Molyneaux, leader of the Ulster
Unionist party, said Mr Spring's comments amounted to an 'incitement to take
the paramilitary road'.
Sir Patrick and Mr Spring also clashed over the exclusion order served on Mr
John Matthews, who was cleared in court of an attempted bomb attack on
Downing Street. In spite of attempts by Mr Michael Howard, the home
secretary, to defend the order, Mr Spring said he believed Britain should
review the powers it has under the 1974 Prevention of Terrorism Act.

THE TWO regulators of Britain's water industry, the National Rivers
Authority and the Office of Water Services, clashed yesterday over the cost
of cleaning up the country's water supplies.
The authority accused Ofwat of exaggerating the cost of the clean-up, and
providing misleading analyses of who should bear the costs.
The authority is responsible for the quality of water while Ofwat regulates
the performance of the water industry and controls prices.

FT  09 JUL 93 / PIA plan attacked by Pru chief
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR MICK Newmarch, chief executive of Prudential, Britain's largest life
insurer, said the company would be an 'unwilling' participant in a proposed
new self-regulating body if a current blueprint it was considering is
adopted.
Mr Mick Newmarch, chief executive of Prudential, said that a report
commissioned by the board of the proposed new Personal Investment Authority
and carried out by Sir Brian Jenkins far exceeded the remit of a
self-regulating body.
Speaking at the Financial Times Conference on Retail Regulation, Mr Newmarch
renewed his call for direct statutory regulation of the financial services
industry and abolition of the self-regulating framework.
He urged the adoption of a structure similar to that used to regulate
Britain's building societies, saying that regulators needed certain powers
now prohibited to them such as the ability to ban the sale of inherently
flawed products.
After the conference, Mr Newmarch said he doubted that the new PIA would
come to fruition and that the Prudential would not participate unless the
majority of industry participants joined on a voluntary basis.
Separately, Mr Andrew Large, chairman of the Securities and Investments
Board, told the conference he had established a joint working party on
disclosure with Fimbra and Lautro, the two self-regulating bodies for retail
financial services.
The working party will consider, among other things, recommendations from
the Office of Fair Trading on disclosure as well as a proposal from an SIB
consultant, Mr Tim Miller, to help consumers better understand the costs of
the products they buy.
Mr Large said it had become evident that the disclosure regime for life
insurance products proposed by the SIB last year did not go far enough in
meeting consumers' desire for more information.
'But simply calling for more information is not the answer,' he said.
Mr Large added that he did not intend to approve the PIA as a
self-regulating body unless it met the tough new standards in raising
investor protection he set out in a letter to the PIA board earlier this
year.

FT  09 JUL 93 / City banks defiant over IRA letter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE, ROLAND RUDD, TIM BURT and CATHY MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OVERSEAS financial institutions in the City of London reacted defiantly to
yesterday's warning from the IRA of more bombing campaigns in spite of the
creation of the new security zone designed to deter such attacks.
In a letter sent by the IRA to some foreign-owned financial institutions in
the City and published in Republican News, the IRA leadership says: 'No one
should be misled into underestimating the seriousness of the IRA's intention
to mount future planned attacks in the political and financial heart of the
British state.'
An official from the Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Bank, which confirmed that a copy
of the letter was sent to its Bishopsgate offices that were devastated by a
terrorist bomb earlier this year, said: 'Our record shows we will not be
influenced by this sort of propaganda. We've been in Lebanon since 1982 -
something like this will not make us move out of London.'
Mr Paul Hofer, regional head of Credit Suisse's northern Europe operations,
said: 'We have total trust in the UK authorities. We were back one day after
the last bomb.'
Mr David Prosser, deputy managing director of Daiwa Bank (Capital Markets),
said: 'We got bombed out of the Commercial Union building in the first bomb.
It didn't stop us then and another one or maybe two bombs would not stop us
now.'
Deutsche Bank yesterday confirmed it had received a letter but declined to
comment further.
City of London Police confirmed that a number of overseas banks had received
the letters and urged institutions to hand over the letters for forensic
examination. Police experts are now studying the copies of the letter sent
to Deutsche Bank and the Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Bank.
Responding to the continued threat to the City, the Foreign Banks and
Securities Houses Association said its members were now putting more
emphasis on security and welcomed tougher anti-terrorist measures such as
the road check-points.
Mr Ian Mckay, secretary of the association, which represents 150 overseas
institutions, added: 'Our members will not be swayed by this attempt to
destabilise London.'
However, concern at the threat of a City bombing campaign yesterday prompted
a Scandinavian securities house, which asked not to be named, to draw up
contingency plans to leave the Square Mile.
A senior official at the institution said it planned to install dealing room
facilities in a building outside the City.
The IRA's letter says: 'In the context of present political realities,
further attacks on the City of London and elsewhere are inevitable. This we
feel we are bound to convey to you directly, to allow you to make fully
informed decisions'.
No copies of the letter are thought to have been sent to US-owned
institutions as the IRA is anxious not to alienate any republican sympathy
in North America.

FT  09 JUL 93 / World Trade News: The Timetable - Countdown To a GATT Deal
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mon July 12: Negotiators return to Geneva after seven-month lapse.
Representatives from 96 countries not involved in the quad process receive
briefing on what has been agreed bilaterally so far.
July 12-July 31: Gatt signatories meet one-on-one to swap market opening
offers. The 'most favoured nation' rule means an offer to one must be
extended to all.
End-July: Mr Peter Sutherland, Gatt director general, is expected to call a
full meeting of the trade negotiating committee - the umbrella body under
which the Uruguay Round is being negotiated - to summarise progress through
July, and to define plans for autumn.
August: Gatt summer break. Valuable time wasted.
September 1 - December 15: Negotiations resume. No structure yet firm. Legal
drafters for the final text of the Uruguay Round final act will work in
parallel, ensuring agreement terms are legally watertight.
December 15: President Clinton's 'fast track' authority expires. This
authority gives him the right to present a Uruguay Round agreement as a
single package to Congress in a take-it-or-leave-it way. Without this it is
assumed a deal as complex as Gatt would never get through since compromises
that made the deal acceptable 110 Gatt signatories could be amended.
January 1 1994: New Gatt agreement comes into effect. Many will need to
introduce it provisionally, since ratification could take some time into
1994.

FT  09 JUL 93 / World Trade News: Those who stand to win and lose in the
wrangling
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
These are the issues to be discussed in the Uruguay Round of trade talks, to
resume on Monday - and a look at the parties with the most to gain, or lose,
from them.
FARM TRADE: Liberalisation of farm trade is critical to developing
countries, frustrated by lack of access to US and EC markets. They are upset
at damage done to world food prices by dumping of farm surpluses onto world
markets, particularly by the EC. Politically powerful farm lobbies in the EC
and the US will fight to maintain existing protection.
Winners: Developing countries, and the countries of eastern Europe, who
would see enhanced export opportunities and higher world prices. The US,
Australia and New Zealand, with efficient farm sectors, should also gain.
Losers: The EC, where the Common Agriculture Policy provides secure farm
incomes regardless of global competitiveness, and funds the dumping of large
farm surpluses onto world markets.
COMPREHENSIVE TARIFICATION: Gatt wants to get rid of hidden or easily
manipulated forms of protection - including quotas, market sharing
arrangements, and other non-tariff barriers to trade - and to replace them
with tariffs. These are more transparent, and can be reduced progressively.
This is also basically a farm issue, focused on Japanese and South Korean
refusal to open their markets to rice markets; the EC's banana import
regime; and Canada's farm supply management system.
Winners: Developing countries, and leading grain exporters like the US;
Latin American banana exporters.
Losers: Protected Japanese and Korean farmers; banana exporters in the
Caribbean and other former colonies with preferential access to the EC
market; protected Canadian dairy farmers.
TEXTILES exports are critical to many developing countries, which have had
most exports controlled by quotas under the Multifibre Arrangement. The
Uruguay Round deal will phase these out over 10 years, leaving national
tariffs as the only barriers to trade. Winners: Developing countries, which
should see exports to the US and the EC rise; the EC and Japan, where high
quality products now kept out of the US market by high tariffs will find new
demand.
Losers: The US, where producers will in the next decade lose both quota and
tariff protection; developing countries, which will have to open markets to
imports over a similar period. STEEL: Global over-capacity, and a complex
history of subsidy, have led to oversupply in many products. Recession has
cut demand for steel. New technology has destroyed the viability of many
older integrated steel mills. Producers across the world have fought for
protection, and trade management, while struggling to modernise and
rationalise. The history of the Multilateral Steel Agreement is tangled in
these conflicting forces. Winners: Exporters to the US, now blocked by penal
dumping and countervailing duties; efficient mills, particularly mini-mills,
which should prosper once an MSA is finalised.
Losers: Inefficient, integrated mills anywhere. Mills propped up by
subsidies, or protected markets.
TRADE IN SERVICES: One big breakthrough of the Uruguay Round would be to
attack barriers to trade in services. This covers a broad range such as
insurance, banking, securities, construction, distribution, tourism,
software and computer services, professional and business services,
including consulting, engineering, accounting and legal services. Opening up
financial services markets across the developing world has been a high
priority for the US and Europe Winners: Financial services companies,
professionals and consultants in the US and the EC (particularly France).
Losers: Protected and inefficient service providers in east Asia and the
developing world. Japan, Korea and the five Asean countries have been
targeted in particular for financial services liberalisation.
MARITIME SERVICES: The US wants port, and onshore activities linked with
shipping to be opened up; for the EC and Japan, an assault on the
cartel-like conferences that control much of the world's blue water shipping
is the priority. Winners: Shippers outside the conferences controlling
particular ocean routes; freight and distribution companies keen to compete
in getting cargoes from factory to port.
AUDIO-VISUAL SERVICES: Sales of films and TV programmes were second only to
aircraft last year as the leading US export. The main market is the EC,
where national limits are frustrating export growth. The US wants the EC to
drop requirements for a minimum percentage of local-language programming,
and of locally produced films and programmes. Cable and satellite
developments are making life even more complicated. The EC insists local
culture must be protected.
Winners: The US, if the EC were opened further. Japanese companies now
control many leading US film-makers, so they have slipped alongside the US
on this issue. India's film industry generates significant export income.
Losers: The EC, in particular France, where US cultural hegemony is
unpopular.
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS: Protection of copyright and patents is lax in
much of the developing world, prompting the US to fight for progress in the
Uruguay Round towards enforcement of intellectual property protection -
across books and music to videos and computer software. At the same time,
many developing countries resent paying high royalties to western
pharmaceutical companies for licences to use drugs they need cheaply for
their people. Developing countries have linked concessions here to
concessions in the US and Europe over farm trade and textiles.
Winners: Many companies, mostly in the industrial world, which need
effective patent and copyright protection to justify big investments in
research and innovation.
Losers: Poor consumers of medicines and food preparations in the developing
world, who may have to pay more; videos and computer software pirates;
plagiarists of designs or other product innovations.
DISPUTE SETTLEMENT: The US says the Gatt dispute settlement procedures are
slow and fickle but is reluctant to dilute its sovereign dispute settlement
laws by handing authority to resolve a dispute over to a multilateral agency
like Gatt. They are anxious to strengthen its authority, since they feel it
is the only medium in which they can handle a trade dispute with a big
trading power like the US or the EC. They want bilateral weapons in
international trade disputes - like the US Section 301 laws - eliminated.
Winners: All developing countries, and many industrial ones subject to
bilateral trade pressure from the US.
Losers: The US, which wants to keep Section 301. MULTILATERAL TRADE
ORGANISATION: The Uruguay Round was meant to achieve what should have been
achieved in 1947, when Gatt was born: a trade body with more authority than
now, to embrace trade in manufactures, agriculture and textiles, and the new
area of services. It would also embrace the Tokyo Round 'codes' on
subsidies, dumping and procurement. Winners: All those who subscribe to
multilateral settlement of trade problems.
Losers: The US, and those concerned about erosion of sovereign authority, as
the MTO would mean some national powers were delegated beyond the courts of
the land.
SUBSIDIES, DUMPING, PROCUREMENT: These are contentious in their own right.
National policies in these areas have increasing impact on trade. They are
the subject of special 'codes' overseen by Gatt, to which only a minority of
countries backing Gatt are signatories. Signatories want more countries to
sign up to the disciplines of these codes. Winners: Developing countries,
which can ill afford industrial subsidies and are often victims of dumping
actions: the US and the EC, by making more countries subject to disciplines
of the codes.
Losers: The US, fearing erosion of its sovereign powers; developing
countries, many not yet disciplined by the codes; the EC, a heavy user of
subsidies and a procurement market coveted by the US.

FT  09 JUL 93 / World Trade News: A general agreement to put an end to the
talk - There is a feeling that the new Uruguay Round deadline is for real
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE long-dormant Uruguay Round of global trade talks will get under way
again in Geneva on Monday when negotiators from the so-called Quad countries
 -the US, the European Community, Japan and Canada - brief trading partners
on their tariff-cutting deal reached in Tokyo this week.
It is the signal the 100-plus nations taking part in the round have been
waiting for since January, when US and EC negotiators failed in a last-ditch
effort to come up with a market access package before President George Bush
left office. Now trade officials have just five months to conclude the
complex Uruguay Round package before US negotiating authority expires on
December 15.
This is the fourth successive end-of-year deadline for the round, launched
in Uruguay in 1986 - but officials are adamant it is the last.
'Every indication suggests that this time the deadline is the deadline,' Mr
Peter Sutherland, new director-general of the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade, says warning of the many difficulties still ahead.
The key problem areas are:
Tariffs: The four-way accord between the world's biggest traders has to be
accepted by all 111 Gatt members. This is because, under Gatt's
non-discriminatory most-favoured-nation rule, they are entitled to benefit
from the same trading terms.
Developing nations may well feel the US has not done enough to cut its very
high tariffs on textiles.
Elimination of steel tariffs is conditional on concluding a Multilateral
Steel Agreement which would outlaw most subsidies to the hard-pressed
industry. But the 30-nation negotiations on an MSA, which resumed for two
days in Geneva this week, are making little headway.
Agriculture: The Quad agreement did not include a market access deal for
agricultural products. These negotiations promise to be stormy. Japan and
South Korea are refusing to relax their bans on imported rice, while the US
and the 13-strong Cairns Group of farm-product exporting countries are
pressing for better access to EC markets. Latin American banana producers
have threatened to veto any Uruguay Round accord if the EC does not change
its discriminatory banana import regime.
Meanwhile, France has maintained its strong opposition to a deal between US
and EC negotiators on overall cuts in farm subsidies. Services: The Quad
countries did not reach any firm agreement on opening markets for foreign
services, though trade officials in Geneva say enough progress was made for
the broader negotiations to resume in earnest. In financial services, the US
and EC will be pursuing further concessions from Japan and other Asian
nations in bilateral talks.
However, the US shows little sign of giving way on exempting shipping from
multilateral disciplines, while the EC wants to continue restrictions on
(mainly American) television programmes, films and videos.
Rules package: Negotiators must finalise the draft package of rules known as
the 'Final Act' drawn up by Mr Arthur Dunkel, Mr Sutherland's predecessor,
in December 1991. Mr Sutherland said this week he was 'absolutely committed'
to the Dunkel text as a basis for negotiation.
The bulk of the draft, which runs to more than 400 pages, covers 15 subject
areas and contains 26 separate agreements, was negotiated between trading
partners.
But, despite warnings that too many changes could lead to a general
unstitching of the carefully balanced package, the US in particular is
pushing for controversial amendments.
In the minds of many trade diplomats, from both rich and poor countries, the
biggest obstacle to a Uruguay Round accord may prove to be US insistence on
the primacy of its national trade laws over multilateral agreements,
especially in using or threatening unilateral sanctions against 'unfair'
traders.

FT  09 JUL 93 / The G7 Summit: Clarke highlights G7's failure to create jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
MR Kenneth Clarke, the UK chancellor of the exchequer, yesterday warned that
the Group of Seven industrialised economies could face rising unemployment
even if they achieved 3 per cent a year growth.
He said the summit had 'picked up a theme' in the need to tackle structural
unemployment. In draft copies of the economic communique that will be
released after the summit today, the G7 countries stress that they are
concerned about low growth and failure to create jobs and say it is
unacceptable that 23m are unemployed in the G7 countries.
Reducing unemployment requires prudent macroeconomic policies to promote
non-inflationary growth and structural reforms to improve the efficiency of
markets, especially labour markets, it says.
Mr Clarke said Britain was 'ahead of the game' compared with some G7
partners in deregulating and tackling the problems of its economy.
He welcomed US President Bill Clinton's proposal for a further meeting of G7
finance, economic and labour ministers this autumn.
The meeting would consider whether labour markets were sufficiently
flexible, if benefit and training systems gave the unemployed incentives to
take jobs, and would study the phenomenon of unemployment rising in good as
well as bad periods in the economic cycle.
The draft communique commits Europe to implementing tough budgetary policies
with the aim of lowering interest rates. Mr Clarke said Britain was
committed to tackling its public sector deficit. That was why it had signed
up to the Maastricht treaty convergence criteria which envisage reducing the
deficit to 3 per cent of gross domestic product by late in this decade from
around 8 per cent now.
The chancellor made clear that the government was preparing difficult
spending decisions in the forthcoming public spending round. Although he
insisted that the government was not planning to abolish the welfare state,
every developed country had to ensure that its welfare system operated in a
cost effective way.
Mr Clarke was careful to draw a distinction between the US and Europe, with
their high unemployment and fiscal deficits, and Japan, with its low jobless
rate and fiscal surplus.
However, he urged Japan to increase its domestic demand to improve the
living standards of its people and increase imports. In spite of Japan's
greater national wealth, 'the living standards of the average Japanese are
not the living standards of the average Brit,' he said.
But he was also willing to learn from Japan. Its education and training
system seemed not to produce the underclass of underachievers as found in
Britain.
Mr Clarke disclosed that Britain had pushed its G7 partners to be more
generous in writing off the debt of the poorest developing nations that are
enacting economic reforms.
However, a UK attempt to obtain agreement for countries to write off 80 per
cent of poorest nations' stock of debt foundered largely on opposition from
Japan.
According to the economic declaration that will be issued today Japan has
promised 'as necessary' to implement fiscal and monetary measures to ensure
strong domestic demand-led growth.
This, it says, will contribute to a reduction of external imbalances, but
the text adds that Japan must keep in mind the need for medium-term fiscal
prudence.
In North America, the G7 have agreed to continue policies to ensure a
'substantial and steady reduction in fiscal deficits over the medium term,
higher levels of domestic savings and investment and lower long-term rates.'
The G7 leaders will insist that a successful and rapid conclusion of the
Uruguay Round of trade talks will boost the confidence of investors and
consumers and be an important contribution to recovery and growth.
They will express confidence that these policies will put their economies
back on track for sustainable non-inflationary growth.

FT  09 JUL 93 / The G7 Summit: Yeltsin turns up with a smile and apologies -
Russian leader shrugs off earlier slights to Japanese sentiment over Kurile
Islands dispute
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
TO THE RELIEF of his Japanese hosts, who must have been wondering if he
would ever touch tarmac in Tokyo, Russia's President Boris Yeltsin yesterday
arrived for the Group of Seven summit with a wry smile and an expression of
regret for previous appointments he was unable to keep.
Twice in the past year, Mr Yeltsin has cancelled bilateral visits. But the
Russian leader was confident that in attending a multilateral conference he
would not be forced to make concessions on the territorial dispute with
Tokyo over the Kurile Islands, off northern Japan.
On landing, Mr Yeltsin said he 'regretted' having been unable to pay an
official visit last September and expressed gratitude to the Japanese
government and people for their 'understanding of the circumstances' which
had forced him to cancel.
That visit was called off under combined pressure from conservative
opponents who accused him of planning to sell off Russian territory, and
from Japanese expectations of real progress in retrieving the Kuriles in
return for economic aid.
Yesterday Mr Yeltsin assured his Japanese hosts that they would 'always find
in the new Russia an honest and constant partner'.
Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the Japanese prime minister, later said the Russian
leader's statement was appreciated by the Japanese people. In Japan Mr
Yeltsin is almost as unpopular as Mr Miyazawa's cabinet, which has an
approval rating under 10 per cent.
A Japanese foreign ministry official said the two countries agreed that
preparations would begin for the much-postponed bilateral visit to take
place in mid-October.
But the Japanese appeared to be setting themselves up for a new
disappointment when a foreign ministry official said Mr Yeltsin had to
expect substantive negotiations on the territorial issue.
'In talking about improving relations, we take a position that the
improvement will come with the settlement of this dispute,' a foreign
ministry official said. 'He (Mr Yeltsin) also has some understanding that
this is the issue.'
Although strengthened by his victory in the April constitutional referendum,
Mr Yeltsin still faces considerable domestic opposition to any territorial
concessions, particularly now that Russia itself is in danger of breaking
up. Only yesterday, the Far Eastern region centred on the key port of
Vladivostok declared itself to be a republic within Russia.
The four Kurile Islands were occupied by Soviet troops in the final days of
the second world war, and the two countries have been unable to sign a peace
treaty because of the dispute over their ownership. Mr Miyazawa told the
Russian leader that Japan understood his domestic difficulties, but that
their differences must be settled on the principles of 'law and justice' - a
formula also used by Mr Yeltsin but with a different meaning.

<TEXT>
THE GERMAN economy seems to have reached the bottom of its recession, German
ministers said in Tokyo yesterday.
Mr Theo Waigel, the finance minister, said the economy appeared to be in the
'bottom of the valley', and Mr Gunter Rexrodt, economics minister, indicated
it could be at a turning point.
'I do not want to give the impression that recovery is beginning in
Germany,' Mr Rexrodt said. But said recent indicators had been either
'positive or at least not more negative'.
Mr Rexrodt said business expectations in industry had improved, the consumer
climate had not deteriorated for the past two months and the inflow of
foreign orders had improved.
Mr Rexrodt said the G7 finance ministers had expressed satisfaction with
last week's interest rate cuts in Germany and there was no explicit
criticism of the Bundesbank's interest rate policy.
By contrast, there had been heavy pressure on Japan to expand domestic
demand.

FT  09 JUL 93 / The G7 Summit: Leaders spotlight migrants, nuclear arms and
local conflicts
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Extracts from the text of the Group of Seven political declaration adopted
yesterday at the Tokyo Summit:
THE PROTECTION of human rights is the obligation of all nations, as affirmed
at the World Conference on Human Rights in Vienna.
The increased number of refugees and displaced persons as well as the
problems of uncontrolled migration and difficulties confronted by national
minorities require urgent attention by the international community, and
should be tackled taking account of their root causes.
Terrorism, particularly when sponsored by states, poses a grave danger which
we will oppose energetically.
IN PROMOTING our partnership of co-operation, reforms in the former
centralised economies should be further encouraged.
We look forward to democratic, stable and economically strong societies in
those countries. We firmly support the determined reform efforts by Russia
under President Yeltsin and his government.
We also look to Russia to promote its diplomacy based on the principle of
law and justice and to continue to play constructive and responsible roles
in the international community.
We also support the reform process in Ukraine and hope that the recent
meeting between Presidents Yeltsin and Kravchuk will provide a basis for
further improvement of relations between the two countries.
ENHANCED co-operation is necessary in combating the danger of proliferation
of weapons of mass destruction and missiles. In particular we:
Urge North Korea to retract immediately its decision to withdraw from the
NPT, and to fully comply with its non-proliferation obligations, including
the implementation of IAEA safeguards agreement and the Joint Declaration on
Denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula;
Encourage the countries concerned of the former Soviet Union to ensure
rapid, safe and secure elimination of nuclear weapons in accordance with
current agreements, providing effective assistance to this end;
Urge Ukraine to ratify the START Treaty, and Ukraine and Kazakhstan to
accede to the NPT as non-nuclear weapon states.
We also continue our efforts to strengthen the non-proliferation regimes,
including the Missile Technology Control Regime, and to establish effective
export controls.
We reiterate the objectives of universal adherence to the NPT as well as the
Treaty's indefinite extension in 1995 and nuclear arms reduction. We also
call on those countries that have not done so to sign the Chemical Weapons
Convention and to accede to the Biological Weapons Convention.
FACED with the rapidly deteriorating situation in former Yugoslavia, we
reaffirm our commitment to the territorial integrity of Bosnia-Hercegovina
and to a negotiated settlement based on the principles of the London
Conference.
We cannot agree to a solution dictated by the Serbs and the Croats at the
expense of the Bosnian Moslems. We will not accept any territorial solution
unless it has the agreement of the three parties.
If the Serbs and Croats persist in dismembering Bosnia through changes of
border by force or ethnic cleansing, they will place themselves beyond the
pale of the international community and cannot expect any economic or
commercial assistance, especially reconstruction aid.
The UN Security Council Resolutions on safe areas must be implemented fully
and immediately to protect the civilian population.
We commit ourselves to assist the Secretary-General of the United Nations to
implement UN Security Council Resolution 836 by sending troops, by air
protection of the UNPROFOR, by financial and logistical contributions or by
appropriate diplomatic action.
Sanctions should be upheld until the conditions in the relevant Security
Council Resolutions are met. Stronger measures are not excluded. The flow of
humanitarian aid to Bosnia must be increased.
Deeply concerned about the situation in Kosovo, we call on the Serbian
government to reverse its decision to expel the CSCE monitors from Kosovo
and elsewhere in Serbia and to agree to a significant increase in their
numbers.
WE FULLY support the efforts to achieve a comprehensive, lasting peace
settlement in the Middle East, and call on Israel and the Arab states to
take further steps for confidence-building. We reiterate that the Arab
boycott should end. We call on Israel to respect its obligations with regard
to the occupied territories. We support the efforts of reconstruction in
Lebanon.
We are determined to keep up the pressure on Iraq and Libya to implement all
relevant UN Security Council Resolutions in full.

FT  09 JUL 93 / The G7 Summit: US eyes potential for trade with Asia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE US is considering proposals that could amount to a new Asian trade round
and that could be discussed with other regional leaders in Seattle later
this year.
Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, yesterday said that the US
had in mind 'a framework around Apec (the Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation
group) which would engage the US and the Pacific rim countries to build a
regime that would regularise trade in the region.'
Mr Kantor offered no further details but noted that the US had 'a natural
alliance in Asia to which we have not paid enough attention in the past.'
More than 40 per cent of US trade, he said, was now with Asia, and the
region's economies were growing faster than anywhere else in the world. The
US remained a 'stabilising force' in economic, political and security
affairs.
President Bill Clinton will be attending the Apec meeting in Seattle in
November. He has devoted substantial segments of two big speeches this week
to highlighting the importance of the Asian dimension to US foreign and
economic policy.
US officials insist this new focus should not be translated as an adverse
reflection on the state of trans-Atlantic relations, but naturally reflected
economic and geopolitical realities.
Contrasts were also drawn with the initial Asian policies of President Jimmy
Carter, who sought to reduce the US military presence in the region,
particularly Korea.
Mr Clinton goes to Seoul tomorrow with a very different message.
Meanwhile, Mr Clinton and Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the Japanese prime minister,
agreed to have dinner tonight, raising some hopes that the US and Japan
might reach agreement on a negotiating framework designed to reduce
bilateral trade friction.
Mr Kantor, still savouring the breakthrough achieved in the market access
agreement, refused to predict if an agreement was imminent.
Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the treasury secretary, was equally non-committal though
perhaps marginally more optimistic.
Mr Kantor said it mattered less if it was reached 'this week or next month'
than that it was a solid agreement, with quantifiable targets, that made
possible greater import penetration of Japan.
But he conceded that a pact with Japan would greatly increase the chances of
approval by Congress of the North American Free Trade Agreement with Can-ada
and Mexico 'because it shows your policies are working.'
There were many inter-connections in trade negotiations, he said.
Congressional approval last week extending the president's 'fast track'
negotiating authority until December 15 had helped get the market access
agreement in Tokyo.
He hoped that the 'side' agreements to Nafta - covering the environment,
labour standards and trade 'surges' - would be completed by the end of this
month.

<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR, the UK prime minister, made limited headway in his attempt to
cut the annual G7 summits down to size.
British officials yesterday admitted that Mr Major's proposal to limit
future summits to heads of government had not won sufficient support. The
US, Canada and Italy backed the plan but it was strongly resisted by France
and Germany.
Both countries have coalition governments and the inclusion of finance and
foreign ministers in the talks enables the different parties in government
to be represented.
The UK prime minister had more success with his plans to strip the summits
of the pomp and bureaucracy that has grown over the years.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the UK chancellor, said he expected next year's summit in
Italy would have 'fewer people, less formality. . . more free-flowing
discussion and a little less structure.'
According to a senior Canadian official, Mrs Kim Campbell, the Canadian
prime minister and another summit novice, was 'in favour of anything' which
could make summits more informal.
'People were very firm that we have got to cut down the ceremonial and the
36,000 cops out there,' the Canadian official said.
UK officials said future summits would end with either a press briefing or
chairman's statement rather than a long-winded communique.
The role of the sherpas, the officials who prepare the summits, would be
radically cut to reflect the reduced workload of a meeting without a final
prepared statement.
A UK plan to limit the summits to two days gained partial acceptance. In
future, talks among the seven will be limited to two days, but additional
talks such as today's 'G7 plus one' meeting with President Yeltsin will run
into a third day.

FT  09 JUL 93 / The G7 Summit: Summiteers harden rhetoric over Bosnia - But
accord a far cry from earlier warnings of military intervention
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton was not alone in coming to Tokyo in the hope that not
too much attention should be paid to the precise wording of summit
communiques.
But in the middle of yesterday morning there appears to have been a
collective realisation by the G7 leaders that there could be no excuse for
not finding the right words to use on Bosnia.
This was why the summit adjourned temporarily while the foreign ministers
were sent off to strengthen the language of the political declaration.
If what was finally agreed was a far cry from the stern warnings of military
intervention issued in Munich a year ago - and totally ignored ever since -
several leaders were able to claim credit for the fact that the G7 did not
completely walk away from the Bosnian tragedy.
The process started over dinner on Wednesday evening with, according to US
and other officials, Mr Clinton's strong intervention and the observation of
Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany that Serbian and, intriguingly, Croatian
behaviour was 'beyond the pale'.
It was continued at a late-night session with Mr John Major at the
president's hotel during which the British prime minister echoed Mr Kohl's
choice of words, which was duly incorporated into the communique. Yesterday,
virtually all the other heads of government chipped in with their own
supportive observations.
As David Gergen, Mr Clinton's counsellor, put it yesterday, the objective
was to strengthen the language 'without raising false expectations'. Another
senior US official, speaking off the record and thus perhaps more frankly,
agreed that the people of Sarajevo would not necessarily be sleeping easier
in their beds as a result of the words of the communique.
But, from the point of view of the US and all other participants, the
insertion of the sentence 'stronger measures are not excluded' is an
implicit reference to Mr Clinton's belief that the arms embargo against
Bosnia should be ended.
Mr Douglas Hurd, the UK foreign secretary, who has argued vigorously against
lifting the embargo because it would merely 'level the killing fields',
concurred. He even used, by his standards, exotic language in a briefing.
The Serbs and Croats, he said, 'are still in the excitement of killing each
other and gaining hills and villages. They think they have to hate their
neighbours from here to kingdom come.' But he allowed for the possibility
that the relief role now being played by British and other peacekeeping
troops might become untenable, in which case nothing could indeed be
excluded.
But another senior UK official speaking after the foreign secretary had left
for China, appeared to distance himself from Mr Hurd's 'stand alone'
comments.
An equally significant concession may have come from Germany, sponsor of the
European Community's recognition of Croatia last year. For the first time,
the political declaration raised the threat of sanctions against Croatia if,
along with Serbia, it continued to push for the dismemberment by force of
Bosnia.
This meant, as US officials were not slow to point out, that Europe's most
influential leaders had committed themselves to withdrawing whatever
preferential arrangements Croatia now enjoys with the EC.
None of this, nor the other last-minute insertion vowing support, including
US air cover, for UN resolution 836 covering 'safe areas', amounts to a
girding of the international loins to stop Serbian and Croatian
aggrandisement.
But as Mr Perrin Beatty, Canadian minister for external affairs, put it, the
Serbs and Croats should now be under no illusion that they can go about
carving up Bosnia as they wish and find that in six months' time the
international community will accept the outcome and help them rebuild
shattered communities. Or, in the words of a senior US official, the
declaration 'makes clear that there is no chance of the international
recognition of whatever entity emerges in Bosnia unless it is agreed to by
all the parties.'
Again from the US perspective, the political declaration's section on the
Middle East also breaks new summit ground. Unlike two years ago, the call
for the ending of the Arab boycott of Israel was issued without conditions
referring to Israeli settlements policy in the occupied territories. This
may help ease some of the latest tensions between Washington and Jerusalem
over the course of the Middle East peace negotiations.
More significant was the sentence on Iran's behaviour. A senior official,
noting the extensive commercial relations between several G7 countries and
Iran, including the sale of dual-use technology, described the regime in
Tehran as 'an international outlaw' and 'a serious threat to stability'
because of its support of terrorism and its determination to disrupt the
Middle East peace process.
He then put US concerns very bluntly: 'We don't want to look back in five
years' time and find we have made the same mistake with Iran that we made
with Iraq.' He noted that previous summits had refused to single out Iran
and Libya for specific criticism because of the risk to trade with both
countries.
All the officials representing their national leaders have claimed credit
for toughening the language of the political declaration, while Mr Clinton's
men generously allowed that the process was 'collegial'. In reality, most of
it was drafted months ago, with the exception of the Bosnian segment, left
until last because of the fluidity of the situation there.
But Mr Clinton's summit agenda seems at least as well served as anybody's,
and probably better than most. On Bosnia, the Middle East, nuclear
non-proliferation and aid to Russia, all areas of prime US concern but not
ones on which there has always been unanimity among the G7, the president
has received endorsements appropriate for his status as still the most
powerful individual member of the club.
They come only in the form of words, many of which have proved empty enough
in the past, never more than last year in Munich.
But, as the ubiquitous Mr Gergen put it, they were at least the result, for
once, of 'productive and free-wheeling' exchanges between the summitteers.
And hopes that future summits will be more informal and focused, like this
one, have some chance of being realised.

SEVEN Islamic militants were hanged in Egypt yesterday on charges of
attacking foreign tourists and seeking to overthrow the government - the
greatest number of executions for political crimes in the country's recent
history. Five were hanged in 1982 for assassinating President Anwar Sadat.
The seven were convicted by a military court in April of six separate bomb
and firearm attacks on tourist buses and Nile cruisers late last year, in
one of which a young Englishwoman was killed.
The men were among 49 tried in the case, including six in absentia, who had
proclaimed loyalty to the Gamaa al-Islamiyya extremist group which has
claimed responsibility for attacks on tourism and security forces over a
year.
A total of 22 individuals have been sentenced to death in trials arising
from politically-motivated violence since December last year. President
Hosni Mubarak has made a point of publicly ratifying each one to signal his
government's resolve to crush the threat from Islamic extremists.
Five more men face the scaffold later this month after being convicted in
May for their part in four bombings and an attempt on the life of Mr Safwat
Sherif, the information minister, who escaped a shooting near his Cairo home
with light injuries last April.
The government's determination to mete out the severest penalties possible
on Islamic militants comes despite rising opposition from western and
domestic human rights groups both to the use of the death penalty and to the
conduct of trials by military courts.

<TEXT>
NIGERIA'S military regime has gained provisional backing from both the
country's political parties to set up a joint interim government of
unelected civilians on August 27 instead of the democratically elected
government promised by President Ibrahim Babangida.
Yesterday's agreement by the Social Democratic party (SDP) and National
Republican Convention (NRC) to take part underlines the dominant position of
the armed forces, which annulled last month's presidential elections after
it became clear that the SDP had won.
The plan weakens the chances of Mr Moshood Abiola, the successful SDP
candidate in the June polls, becoming Nigeria's next president.
A diplomat in Nigeria yesterday described the military's handling of the
crisis since they refused to uphold the SDP's victory as 'a very good
tactical withdrawal. The people have expressed a view at the ballot box, but
the military retain control, leaving Abiola with no cards to play.'
The civilian protest against the annulment of last month's polls subsided
yesterday, two days earlier than planned. Businesses, government offices and
transport resumed normal operation in the commercial capital after a
crackdown on security and deployment of troops quelled widespread disorder.
Several key members of the Campaign for Democracy, which organised the
protest, have been detained by security forces.
On Thursday Mr Abiola said he had no hand in the demonstrations, desite the
overwhelming support they showed from his fellow Yorubas in Lagos and other
parts of the south-west. He dissociated himself from the violence and
destruction arising from the protests, called for order and said: 'Justice
will prevail.'
This is a far cry from Mr Abiola's message last week to defy the military's
annulment of the polls and 'damn the consequences.'
The ruling National Defence and Security Council will meet in Abuja today to
discuss the proposals of the two army-created parties.

FT  09 JUL 93 / UN team due in Iraq to seal missile sites: Rockets become
focus of new confrontation with Baghdad
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THE UNITED Nations last night despatched a team of ballistic missile experts
to Iraq with orders to seal equipment and facilities at two rocket testing
sites that have become the focus of a new confrontation with Baghdad.
Mr Rolf Ekeus, chairman of the UN's weapons inspection commission, announced
the measure, which he called an interim one, in response to Iraq's refusal
to permit the installation of monitoring cameras at the sites.
While describing the move as a way 'to open another door' for Iraqi
compliance, he also stressed that 'a very serious situation' would result if
the Iraqis broke the seals.
These would be applied in order to ensure that no tests could be conducted
until UN cameras were in place.
The Security Council, to which Mr Ekeus reported behind closed doors
yesterday, has already warned Baghdad of the serious consequences of
continued intransigence.
The council is committed to the employment of all necessary measures to
ensure Iraqi compliance with its directives.
But the commission chairman said there was a 'mindset' in the Iraqi
leadership not to give up their ambitions.
He had detected no inclination to disperse weapons personnel or provide data
sought by the UN about sources of supply.
Mr Ekeus withdrew his inspectors earlier this week after the Iraqis refused
to allow the installation of cameras, on political grounds.
Baghdad's objections were termed political.
However, Iraq backed down after first refusing to deliver to the commission
for destruction chemical weapons production equipment and 'precursor
chemicals.'
Mr Ekeus reported that all of the equipment had been destroyed under UN
supervision and the precursors would soon follow.
As for the missile testing programme, he disclosed that air and ground
surveillance on Wednesday determined that at one site the metal
superstructure of a test stand had been dismantled and the parts distributed
around it.
According to experts, all could be reassembled and operable within the space
of a few days.
The facilities and equipment would enable the Iraqis to test rocket motors
for missiles up to the permitted 150km range, as well as a prohibited range
in excess of that limit.
The team of experts due to arrive in Baghdad tomorrow had an inventory of
the equipment at both sites, which Iraq was forbidden by a UN resolution
from moving without commission consent.
Mr Ekeus renewed an invitation to Iraq to enter high-level technical talks
with the UN planned to be held in New York next Monday with the aim of
sorting out a number of problems encountered by the commission.
Meanwhile, UN and Iraqi delegations continued talks yesterday on the
possible resumption of oil exports by Iraq.
The Security Council agreed almost two years ago to permit shipments of
Dollars 1.6bn (Pounds 1.06bn) worth of oil over a six month period.
According to Britain's Sir David Hannay, the current Security Council
president, a new resolution would be necessary to make effective any accord
that the two sides might work out.

FT  09 JUL 93 / China seeks cash for ploughshares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IN BEATING its swords into ploughshares China's People's Liberation Army has
turned to the outside world for assistance - making China the only military
power seeking to have its 'peace dividend' underwritten by foreign
investment.
On show in Hong Kong this week is an exhibition - decked with banners
proclaiming 'peace, development, co-operation' - of industrial hardware
which the PLA's factories across China produce for civilian use.
On hand for the exhibition - the first to be held outside China - are senior
officials from the Chinese central government's Commission on Science,
Technology, and Industry for National Defence (Costind), which oversees the
mainland's massive armaments industry and reports directly to the PLA high
command.
One of the most important is Ms Nie Li, vice-director of Costind, wife of
General Ding Henggao, Costind's director, and daughter of the late Marshall
Nie Rongzhen, father of China's nuclear weapons industry.
At Monday evening's gala opening she rubbed shoulders with some of Hong
Kong's leading tycoons, including Mr Li Ka-shing, Mr Stanley Ho, Mr T T
Tsui, and Mr Larry Yung, the son of Mr Rong Yiren, China's vice-president
and head of Citic Pacific, one of Beijing's biggest companies in the colony.
The presence in Hong Kong of the top executives from China's
military-industrial complex selling their wares and trying to raise
much-needed foreign capital reflects two developments which have occurred
since 1978 when the mainland embarked on economic modernisation.
The first is the encouragement PLA factories were given to switch their
production from military hardware to civilian goods. This followed the
cutting of the PLA's strength from about 4m to 2.5m. Nearly 70 per cent of
the output of China's defence industries is classified as 'civilian' and the
mainland wants to increase the share of civilian output further.
The switch to civilian output has already made China's military factories
dominant in some consumer industries. The six main defence industries -
nuclear, astronautics, aeronautics, ordnance, electronics and shipbuilding -
produce more than 60 per cent of China's output of motorcycles, washing
machines and electric fans. By the end of the 1980s the civilian production
of these six industries accounted for about 20 per cent of China's total
machine industry output, by value.
The second factor pushing the PLA's factories into the outside world is of
more recent origin. In light of Chinese arms failures in the Gulf war, the
PLA has had to diversify its sources of foreign revenue to compensate for
its declining ability to sell arms abroad. Also, it has stepped up
procurement of superior quality foreign-made military hardware, especially
from Russia, spending an estimated Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.3bn) in the past
couple of years.
To fund these weapons acquisitions and further modernise the PLA's
industrial base, the military needs money and foreign know-how. Although the
PLA was one of the few arms of the Chinese government to receive a real,
inflation-adjusted, rise in its budget this year (up 13.5 per cent to
Dollars 7.3bn), its thirst for investment funds has remained unquenched.
Already two of the PLA's directly-controlled companies have set up in Hong
Kong. China Poly group, which is owned by the procurement department of the
PLA general staff, has acquired a Hong Kong listed company, Continental
Mariner. The other, China Xinxing corporation, which is owned by the PLA's
general logistics department, established a representative office last
October.
The purpose of these companies, and many more mainland companies like them,
is to raise foreign equity for investment on the mainland. Chinese law
defines Hong Kong as 'foreign' for the purpose of direct investment;
mainland companies get taxed at about half the national rate if foreigners
invest in them.
Companies controlled by Xinxing - which owns about 100 factories throughout
China making garment, shoes, electronic products and military supplies -
have this week signed contracts with foreign investors worth Dollars 1.25bn.
The largest, a Yn4bn (Pounds 460m) property development in Beijing, is a
joint venture with the Singapore government-controlled DBS Land, which will
take 60 per cent of the project.
Another of the exhibitors, China North Industries Corporation (Norinco), the
largest seller of Chinese made weaponry on the world market, is seeking
Dollars 2.2bn of foreign investment for 166 joint-venture projects on the
mainland. These ranged from a Dollars 14m heavy-duty truck manufacturing
venture in Sichuan, to Dollars 10m for a motorcycle parts factory in Henan,
to a hotel development in Shanxi requiring investment of Dollars 7.6m -
underlining the scope of the Chinese military's enterprises on the mainland.
Separately, the China Association for the Peaceful Use of Military
Industrial Technology was offering foreign investors the opportunity to
participate in 45 joint ventures - many involving laser technology - which
it hopes will raise Dollars 243.3m.

FT  09 JUL 93 / Japanese Elections: Mr and Mrs Middle Japan make cautious
party switch - Robert Thomson takes tea and talks politics with an ordinary
family
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WITH A slight dent in their white Toyota and a crowded 90-minute train ride
to central Tokyo, Tadaaki and Toshie Koizumi are self-consciously middle
Japanese. They buy vegetables from a local co-op, have a restless
20-year-old daughter who wants to live abroad, and intend to break the
voting habits of a lifetime at the coming election.
Tadaaki is an engineer at East Japan Sugar Industries, linked to the
Mitsubishi family of companies, while Toshie works part time at the local
school preparing lunches. Kneeling around a coffee table, they take green
tea and discuss the candidates in the No. 1 constituency in Chiba, where
corruption is an unsurprising part of political life.
'There's not enough talk of policies. People keep talking about reform, but
it's not clear what they mean,' Tadaaki said. 'We don't get clear answers on
things like taxation or the defence forces.'
Both were raised in households loyal to the ruling Liberal Democratic party,
but Tadaaki, 48, and Toshie, 45, have never voted LDP. They are swinging
voters this year, but the party will not get their support on July 18, when
a general election is likely to leave Japan with a coalition government and
the expectation of further instability.
'We have always voted for the Socialist party. We realise that they have
problems with their policies, but we thought that a strong Socialist party
could provide a balance against the LDP. We never really thought they could
win an election,' Tadaaki said.
In Chiba No. 1, five seats are to be contested by nine candidates, typical
of the multi-seat system in Japan. If reforms are introduced after the
election, the electoral boundaries would be narrowed and only one
representative chosen. Voters would also select about half the total of MPs
through proportional representation.
All the old and suddenly-surfaced parties are represented. There are two LDP
candidates, including one who has ties to Tadaaki's soccer club, which
inspires a certain affection in him. Another sitting LDP member has
rebelled, joining the Japan Renewal party, formed by Mr Tsutomu Hata, the
former finance minister. To the Koizumis' eye, the JRP is indistinguishable
in personality and policy from the LDP.
Nor are they much impressed by Komeito, the party backed by Soka Gakkai, the
Buddhist movement, which tends to do well in times of low voter turnout -
the party can count on the faithful to show their devotion at the polling
booth. Komeito has one Chiba seat, and volunteers have started the
ring-around and the door-knocking to ensure that it is retained.
The Koizumis are still fond of Mr Kenichi Ueno, the former Socialist party
representative, and may have voted for him, had he not resigned last year
after a European sojourn in the company of a gangster and a golf course
developer. Mr Ueno, one of the more doctrinaire members of his still
strongly Marxist party, was unable to resist temptations common to Japanese
politics.
He admitted that Mariya, the developer and stock speculator, paid Y300,000
(Dollars 2,800) a month towards his office expenses, and police are
investigating the approval of a Mariya-built golf course - a Chiba graveyard
was moved to make way for the clubhouse. Mariya officials also boasted that
they regularly supplied Mr Ueno's fridge with fine cuts of Japanese beef.
'I think it's very unfair. I was surprised about the links to golf courses
and so on, but he took nothing like the amounts LDP politicians have pulled
in,' Toshie said.
The absence of Mr Ueno, and his party's inability to reform itself have
prompted the Koizumis to look elsewhere for the first time, probably to the
Japan New party. The JNP, formed by a provincial governor, did surprisingly
well at a Tokyo city election last month.
Toshie and Tadaaki are still uncertain about the JNP's policies, which are
pro-reform but vague. They worry about the dispatch of Japanese troops to
the UN peacekeeping operation in Cambodia, fearing that it could be the
start of a more aggressive military policy. And they are bothered by a
separate military issue, the rusting army trucks dumped in a plot opposite
their home.
The Koizumis are unsure whether the coming election will lead to a clean-up
of Japanese politics or of their rubbish mountain, but they admit to more
than the usual excitement. Most interesting, Tadaaki says, is that 'you
can't be certain' that the LDP will win, as it has since 1955.
Both are certain to vote, but their 20-year-old daughter is unlikely to
bother. 'She has absolutely no interest whatsoever in politics,' said
Toshie. It is a matter of concern to them that, at the turning point in
Japanese politics, their otherwise active daughter has been struck down by
apathy.

FT  09 JUL 93 / Seven hanged for terrorism in Egypt: Attacks on tourists and
trying to overthrow government
</HEADLINE>

SEVEN Islamic militants were hanged in Egypt yesterday on charges of
attacking foreign tourists and seeking to overthrow the government - the
greatest number of executions for political crimes in the country's recent
history. Five were hanged in 1982 for assassinating President Anwar Sadat.
The seven were convicted by a military court in April of six separate bomb
and firearm attacks on tourist buses and Nile cruisers late last year, in
one of which a young Englishwoman was killed.
The men were among 49 tried in the case, including six in absentia, who had
proclaimed loyalty to the Gamaa al-Islamiyya extremist group which has
claimed responsibility for attacks on tourism and security forces over the
past year.
A total of 22 individuals have been sentenced to death in trials arising
from politically-motivated violence since December last year. President
Hosni Mubarak has made a point of publicly ratifying each one to signal his
government's resolve to crush the threat from Islamic extremists.
Five more men face the scaffold later this month after being convicted in
May for their part in four bombings and an attempt on the life of Mr Safwat
Sherif, the information minister, who escaped a shooting near his Cairo home
with light injuries last April. Two men were hanged in June - the first
executions for political crimes in Egypt since 1982 - and the remainder of
the 22 sentences were given in absentia.
The government's determination to mete out the severest penalties possible
on Islamic militants comes despite rising opposition from western and
domestic human rights groups both to the use of the death penalty and to the
conduct of trials by military courts.
President Mubarak shifted authority over such cases to military courts in
February to ensure the speediest possible process.
Yesterday's executions come a day after publication of Amnesty
International's annual report, in which it repeats opposition to use of the
death penalty and reiterates allegations of torture, detention without trial
and unfair practices in the military courts.
Just after yesterday's hangings took place in a Cairo prison, in sequence
between 7am and 10am, the Arab Organisation of Human Rights condemned in a
press conference the use of military courts, which were 'outside the normal
legal framework', said Mr Mohammed Fayek, its secretary general.
However, no such opposition is at all likely to deter President Mubarak from
ratifying further death sentences which may result from trials due before
these courts in the next few weeks.
In the biggest of these, a total of 700 alleged members of the Jihad
extremist Islamic group are being tried in two concurrent cases, facing
charges which include the attempted assassination of public figures and
incitement to rebellion.
Moreover, the government has still either to apprehend or to bring charges
against those responsible for an apparently random series of nail-bombings
in Cairo since mid-May which have killed 16 Egyptians.

FT  09 JUL 93 / Border boom town sets lesson in trade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MONG CAI, ON THE VIETNAM-CHINA BORDER
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FOR A DECADE, the town of Mong Cai was almost deserted. As tensions between
Vietnam and China spilled over into a bloody border war in 1979, local
people were driven out of their homes and forced to move elsewhere. But
since they were allowed to return to their homes in 1989, the town's
inhabitants have made up for lost time.
Today, Mong Cai is a boom town, the main centre of rapidly expanding border
trade between the two former enemies. Every day, hundreds of traders load
their goods into small boats that chug up and down the river between Vietnam
and China.
They carry seafood, coconuts, fruit and basic consumer goods into China. On
the return journey, they bring construction materials, machinery and other
consumer durables to Vietnam. Local government officials estimate that the
two-way trade is worth tens of billions of Dong, or millions of dollars,
every month.
At Mong Cai, there's a thriving market selling Vietnamese produce to Chinese
traders and Chinese imports to their Vietnamese competitors. Currency
dealers, almost all of them women, do a roaring trade, exchanging Vietnamese
Dong for Chinese Renminbi. One dealer said she makes a good living now that
the government encourages trade and free enterprise.
There's plenty of evidence that the local authorities on either side of the
border have good relations. They meet frequently and have regular exchange
visits to solve any problems that might hinder the trade on which they are
both thriving.
The volume of trade would be significantly larger, though, if the two
countries could get on as well. Until 1978 a small amount of trade and other
border traffic went over a bridge across the border, the so-called
Friendship Bridge built in the 1960's by Chinese engineers.
The bridge was blown up by Vietnamese Army sappers to stop the Chinese army
driving tanks across the border in 1979. Both sides have now reconstructed
their halves of the bridge but it hasn't yet been reopened because of an
acrimonious dispute over exactly where in the river the border lies.
Once the bridge reopens, local officials estimate that border trade will at
least double. But until Hanoi and Beijing can resolve their differences over
the precise position of the border, all trade will have to be carried on
small and inefficient boats.
Already, though, Mong Cai is living proof that the economic reform policies
being preached in Hanoi are now being practised throughout the country.
Every day, dozens of heavily-laden buses and trucks make the journey to the
border from Hanoi and other areas of northern Vietnam, as well as from towns
along the east coast and as far afield as Saigon, the former capital in the
far south.
There's also a major building boom going on. Local inhabitants who have
returned to the town and other people who have moved in to profit from the
border town are constructing new and more elaborate houses for their
families. And there's every sign that the trading boom will continue.
Mr Nguyen The Phong, the vice chairman of the local government, wants to see
the area develop as a tourist resort as well as a trading post. Already, he
says, his local authority has signed a joint-venture deal with a Hong Kong
company to build a hotel overlooking the five-mile beach just outside Mong
Cai.
For Mr Phong and his local authority, the main drawback to dreams of
expansion is transport. Mong Cai has good beaches and excellent seafood but
the nine-hour drive from Hanoi along narrow, potholed roads is enough to
deter all but the most determined tourists.
Mr Phong, however, has a solution: luckily Mong Cai has an old airfield,
built by the French in the days when they ruled Indo-China.
'Refurbish that,' he says, 'and people could come here for the weekend.'

TWO US-based Indian businessmen were charged yesterday by the US authorities
with bribing bank officials and fraudulently obtaining more than Dollars 27m
(Pounds 18m) in loans from five banks, including the defunct Bank of Credit
and Commerce International.
A third man, a former high-ranking executive at the Bank of Oman's New York
office, was charged with accepting bribes from the two businessmen.
Mr Robert Morgenthau, the Manhattan District Attorney who brought the
charges, said the indictments stemmed from his department's ongoing
investigation into the collapse of BCCI.
The three men indicted yesterday were Mr P S Prasad, his brother, Mr Murali
Ponnapula, and Mr Nasim Syed, a former Bank of Oman official.
In the indictment, they are alleged to have falsely obtained Dollars 16.8m
in loans from BCCI, and the rest from the Branch Banking and Trust Company
of North Carolina, and US branches of the Bank of India, the State Bank of
India, and the Bank of Oman.
Mr Morgenthau said some of the money was used for the personal benefit of Mr
Girish Sharma, an associate of Mr Prasad and the brother of India's
petroleum minister.

society industry, was ordered to serve a 151-month term concurrently with a
10-year state sentence imposed last year.
The judge ordered him to pay Dollars 122m (Pounds 81.3m) in restitution to
federal regulatory authorities, who seized his Lincoln Savings and Loan when
it collapsed in 1989.
'The losses in this case are so extraordinarily large that the chance of
full restitution is remote,' the judge said during sentencing.

FT  09 JUL 93 / Chipmakers hit by factory explosion

MANUFACTURERS of semiconductors are scrambling to find alternative sources
of supply for materials used in packaging microchips, after an explosion at
a Sumitomo Chemical factory, the world's largest source of high-grade epoxy
resins.
The explosion, which occurred on Sunday, at the factory in Niihama, about
680km south-west of Tokyo, severely damaged the epoxy plant.
According to Sumitomo, the plant produces 60 per cent of the world's supply
of high-grade epoxy resins. The resins are essential to the production of
plastic packages for computer chips.
'This is a very serious situation,' said a spokesman for Semiconductor
Equipment and Materials International, an international trade group, 'but we
believe that there are other facilities that can make up for the production
capacity that has been shut down.'
SEMI has begun a world-wide industry survey to find alternative sources of
epoxy resin for the semiconductor industry. It is likely to be three to six
months before the factory is back in production, according to Dan Rose, of
Rose Associates, a semiconductor consulting group specialising in materials
supplies.
The incident has demonstrated the vulnerability of the Dollars 80bn (Pounds
53.3bn) semiconductor industry, which supplies the 'building blocks' used to
make all types of electronic equipment; a Dollars 600bn industry.
Semiconductor manufacturers in the US said they did not expect any immediate
impact, but were concerned about the longer term implications.
'We have inventories that will carry us through the current quarter,' said
Texas Instruments, one of the largest US chipmakers.
'We are currently reviewing the potential impact in the fourth quarter and
may seek alternative suppliers.'
'Any shortage of supply will likely occur toward the end of the year,' Mr
Rose said. Smaller semiconductor producers, who have less influence with
suppliers, were more likely to be affected by any shortages, a semi
conductor industry official said.
In Japan, semiconductor manufacturers expressed concern, but said they
expected to be able to maintain production using packaging material from
other sources.
Prices of epoxy resin and plastic semiconductor packages are expected to
rise in the wake of the Sumitomo explosion, industry analysts said.
Alternative suppliers of epoxy resin should be able to ramp up production
quickly, Mr Rose said, because they have been operating below capacity.
The cause of the explosion at the factory is under investigation in Japan.

FT  09 JUL 93 / Clinton budget plan faces tough passage
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US Congress returns to Washington next week for a month of hard
negotiation over the fate of President Bill Clinton's budget package.
Mr Lloyd Bentsen, treasury secretary, said in Tokyo yesterday that the final
version of the budget legislation could be ready for Mr Clinton to sign by
the first week of August, although some congressional staff see that as
optimistic.
The August recess will provide a deadline that is expected to force a
compromise.
The administration will essentially be left on the sidelines as negotiators
from the House of Representatives and Senate seek to reconcile their all but
irreconcilable versions of the omnibus budget bill.
Mr Clinton made concessions on almost every aspect of his budget plan in
order to win narrow victories in both chambers - by 219 votes to 213 in the
House, and through the intervention of Vice-President Al Gore to break a
49-49 tie in the Senate - but the concessions he made were different in each
chamber. Democratic leaders in both chambers now say that they cannot move
far from their version of the budget without jeopardising the slender
majorities they so painstakingly crafted.
The key difference between the House and Senate bills is the energy tax. The
House preserved the outlines of the broad energy tax originally proposed by
Mr Clinton, though it exempted a number of specific sectors and increased
the basic rate proposed to 26.8 cents per million British thermal units.
Opposition from oil state senators, on the other hand, forced the Senate to
back off from the Btu-based tax and instead opt for a transportation tax of
4.3 cents per gallon.
While the House may be willing to accept some changes in the energy tax it
passed, this wholesale revision seems likely to displease both
environmentalists, who were already angry that a string of exemptions had
gutted the tax of much of its energy-conservation effects, and westerners,
who dislike petrol taxes because of the long dis-tances they have to drive.
Mr Bentsen said only that he expected an energy tax to be included in the
final bill.
Other differences involve House efforts to provide money for programmes for
the poor and for disadvantaged inner cities. The Senate reduced by more than
a third the House's plan to expand the earned income tax credit for
low-income wage earners, and eliminated altogether a plan to create
'empowerment zones' offering investment incentives to businesses.
Besides these differences of substance, the House-Senate conference promises
a political and procedural tussle.
Republican senators have already warned that they will invoke a Senate rule
barring 'extraneous' measures from budget legislation, threatening a number
of measures in the House bill. This has prompted an angry response from Mr
John Dingell, the powerful and irascible chairman of the House energy and
commerce committee, denouncing the Senate for causing gridlock through this
'arcane technicality' of a rule.

FT  09 JUL 93 / Mexico's PRI loosens a 64-year grip
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MEXICO'S governing party has proposed far-reaching political reforms that go
a long way to meeting opposition demands for a more independent electoral
system and more equitable competition between political parties.
The reforms were unveiled on Wednesday and are to be debated in a special
session of Congress. They would set ceilings on party spending, give parties
guaranteed access to the media, hand over power to electoral tribunals, and
increase opposition presence in Congress by selecting a third of the Senate
according to proportional representation.
While the proposals are unlikely to threaten the dominance of the ruling
Institutional Revolutionary party (PRI), they were immediately hailed by
independent observers. Federico Reyes Heroles, editor of the independent
magazine Este Pais, said: 'It meets all the central demands of the
opposition. This is an abrupt step in the modernisation of Mexico.'
The opposition itself was more cautious, describing the still incomplete
proposals as a step forward but still insufficient. However the centre-right
National Action party is expected to back the reforms. Most of the
opposition has come from within the PRI, with many of its congressmen
expressing incredulity at the changes.
The proposed reforms come as President Carlos Salinas de Gortari enters his
last year in power and are intended to defuse opposition charges before next
year's presidential vote that Mexican elections are neither free nor fair.
PRI has been in power in one form or another for 64 consecutive years, and
has long been criticised for rigging elections, grossly outspending
opposition parties in campaigns, and ramming legislation through Congress.
While such mechanisms have helped the PRI stay in power, electoral
irregularities and protests have undermined the legitimacy of the PRI in and
out of Mexico and damaged its capacity to govern. With the opposition in
some disarray, President Salinas has gambled that his party can easily
afford to concede opposition demands without endangering its hold on power.
Under the new rules, the government would allow independent companies to
audit the voting list and distribution of voting credentials and would
accredit independent observers. Electoral tribunals would verify
congressional elections, and not, as now, Congress itself. Results would be
released immediately.
They would limit the maximum contribution by an individual or organisation
to a political party, and the amount that a party might spend on campaigns
'to prevent the disparity in resources decisively influencing the
electorate'. Contributions could only be given to parties, and not to
individuals.
The PRI has also proposed that each state be given three rather than two
Senate seats, with the third senator coming from a minority party that
obtains more than a set percentage of the vote. The law would also scrap the
so-called governability clause, which guarantees a majority in the House of
Deputies to a party which obtains more than 35 per cent of the vote. No one
party will be allowed to have more than 65 per cent of the deputies.
The changes should make the electoral process more transparent, and Mexico's
Congress more powerful. Even if the reforms make the job of winning
elections and passing legislation more difficult for the PRI, Mr Salinas is
prohibited from the constitution from running again for president, and will
not have to suffer the consequences.

In a diplomatic triumph for Cuba, its neighbours in the Caribbean Community
(Caricom) have agreed to set up a joint commission with the island to
oversee co-operation in areas such as trade and the sugar industry, writes
Canute James in Nassau, the Bahamas.
The agreement followed a call by the 13 Caricom nations for the lifting of
the 30-year-old US trade and economic embargo against Cuba.
The commission will seek to increase trade between Cuba and Caricom and
foster co-operation on sugar cane yields and sugar by-products. It will also
promote the development of livestock and fisheries and combine biotechnology
research.
The US has not welcomed the agreement. 'Caricom is made up of democratic
countries and Cuba is not democratic,' said a senior US State Department
official attending the conference.

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Federal Bureau of Investigation is reported to be on the point of coming
out in favour of tougher gun control legislation, George Graham writes from
Washington.
Mr William Sessions, the FBI's director, is understood to have written to Ms
Janet Reno, the US attorney general, asking her to approve a six-point FBI
policy statement calling for stricter licensing of gun dealers and handgun
owners, more restrictions on assault weapons and a ban on the sale of
ammunition capable of piercing bulletproof vests.
Mr Sessions, who is battling to hold onto his job after accusations of
ethical violations, is understood also to propose backing the Brady bill,
named after Mr James Brady, the White House press secretary shot during an
assassination attempt on former President Ronald Reagan.
President Bill Clinton has promised that he will sign this bill, which would
impose a five-day waiting period before any handgun purchase to allow the
police time to conduct background checks, if Congress passes it.
The statement would be an unusual entry into the political arena for the
FBI, but the bureau would only be following a wide array of senior law
enforcement officers across the country, who have become increasingly
disenchanted with the gun lobby led by the National Rifle Association.
The National Association of Chiefs of Police reports that 77.7 per cent of
its members now favour the Brady bill.

MEXICO has achieved its long awaited goal of single-digit inflation, with
annual inflation to June falling to 9.8 per cent, from 10 per cent the
previous month.
This is the first time Mexican inflation has fallen below 10 per cent since
1972. The annual rate was running at 159 per cent as recently as 1987.
Inflation for the month of June was 0.5 per cent.
The government has made cutting inflation central to economic policy, and
greeted yesterday's news with relief. A senior government official said that
if it stayed under control there might be room to loosen fiscal policy.

FT  09 JUL 93 / Romiti investigated over party political financing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR CESARE ROMITI, chief executive of the Fiat group, is being formally
investigated by Turin magistrates for alleged illicit financing of political
parties. He was interrogated for three hours on Wednesday.
Mr Romiti was placed on the list of people under investigation for alleged
illicit party financing by Milan magistrates at the end of May but has yet
to be interrogated by them. Earlier he had offered the full co-operation of
Fiat in the matter.
The Turin action relates to separate episodes. The magistrates' move follows
statements by two prominent local Socialists, Mr Giusy La Ganga, an MP for
the city, and Mr Beppe Garesio, a former editor of Avanti], the Socialist
party's daily newspaper.
The two claim discussions were held in Fiat's Turin headquarters on three
occasions between 1988 and 1990 about how the group should help fund the
Socialists.
Mr Romiti is understood to have denied any discussion of funding the party
and said the conversations focused on political and cultural matters.
Mr La Ganga has been served with seven separate notices from Turin
magistrates that he is under investigation for alleged corruption, and a
further two from Milan magistrates. Mr Garesio has already received three
separate notices.
Last week, Mr Giovanni Agnelli, Fiat chairman, admitted at the annual
meeting that the group had paid a previously undeclared L50bn (Pounds 19m)
in kick-backs to politicians over the previous 10 years. Mr Francesco
Susini, director-general of the Culture Ministry and for more than a decade
the most influential official in the Italian arts world, was yesterday
arrested on charges of corruption and abuse of office.
His arrest coincided with the arrest of Mr Fernando Pinto on charges of
masterminding the October 1991 fire that severely damaged the Bari opera
house of which he was the director.

FT  09 JUL 93 / Hunger strike Serb in danger
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA SILBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A TEAM of doctors appointed by the Serbian government yesterday appealed to
the authorities for the 'urgent release' of jailed opposition leader Vuk
Draskovic 'in order to avoid a fatal outcome'.
The condition of Mr Draskovic, on hunger strike for the past week, was
'rapidly deterioriating' and there were fears for his life, the doctors
warned in a letter to a Belgrade court. They said they could not be held
responsible for his health if he and his wife Danica, jailed on June 1 after
street protests left one policeman dead, were not released.
Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic has rebuffed international appeals for
the release of Mr Draskovic, who was beaten badly by police during his
arrest. But the Serb leader may now choose to release Serbia's most popular
opposition politician rather than risk unrest in the event of his death.
The deterioration in Mr Draskovic's health came as Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg
and Lord Owen, the international peace mediators, arrived in Belgrade to
urge leaders of warring Serbs, Croats and Moslems to end bloodshed in
Bosnia. They met Mr Milosevic and his federal Yugoslav counterpart after
talks on Wednesday with Mr Franjo Tudjman, the Croatian president.
Asked what would happen if all three sides failed to reach agreement by July
20, a deadline set by Bosnian Serb leaders for Moslems to back the
republic's partition on ethnic lines, Mr Stoltenberg said: 'If we don't find
a compromise by that date, I fear an intensification of the war.'
Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, has warned that his forces
would push for total defeat of the mainly-Moslem Bosnian army if partition
is rejected.
But Bosnia's Moslem President Alija Izetbegovic indicated yesterday his
people might have to accept a three-way partition of the country if this was
imposed on them and if the alternative was war without end. In a radio
interview, Mr Izetbegovic said: 'Bosnia is not going to commit suicide,'
apparently ruling out a fight to the finish.
Bosnia's Moslems are confined to isolated pockets at the mercy of their Serb
and Croat enemies.
Serb commanders have all but stopped the flow of overland aid to Sarajevo,
without water and electricity for the past month. The World Health
Organisation said hospital services in Sarajevo were on the brink of
collapse and warned of an impending catastrophe on a scale unseen in Europe
'since the dark days of the second world war'.
Five independent international aid agencies said Sarajevo's 380,000
residents were 'reverting to the most desperate measures to stay alive'.

<DATELINE>
   BUDAPEST
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HUNGARY yesterday devalued the forint by 3 per cent and raised a key
interest rate by 3 percentage points.
The currency is linked to a basket divided equally between the dollar and
the Ecu, and the central bank passed off the devaluation as a 'technical
step' in response to the dollar's rise against European currencies.
This devaluation follows one of 1.9 per cent last month, adding to
speculation that the exchange rate policy is softening. Pressure for a
fundamental shift has been growing as Hungarian exports have fallen and the
external trade balance deteriorated.
Exports in the first four months were down 27.2 per cent compared with a
year earlier, depressed by recession in Hungary's main markets of Germany
and Austria.
The current account deficit amounted to Dollars 423m (Pounds 282m) for the
first two months, leading some analysts to estimate that the shortfall for
the year could be as high as Dollars 2bn, about 8 per cent of gross domestic
product.
The central bank is financing the deficit with a record spree on
international capital markets. Yesterday it announced two more bond issues -
a five-year Y50bn (Pounds 307m) bond in Tokyo and a Pounds 100m bond in
London. The bank's borrowings so far this year total Dollars 2.7bn.
Recent bond issues have sold relatively well, despite the external balance
deterioration.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
UKRAINE'S prime minister, Mr Leonid Kuchma, said yesterday the only solution
to the country's mounting economic crisis was to declare a national state of
emergency.
This was almost immediaitely rejected by President Leonid Kravchuk, who
declared he would rely on his authority, the people and the country's top
industrialists to bring the country out of crisis.
Mr Kuchma described Ukraine's economic situation as worse than at any time
since independence nearly two years ago. He blamed it on the central bank
and higher prices for Russian oil and gas. 'We must at last understand that
just by printing more money we will not make ourselves richer.'
Western economists estimate the monthly inflation rate in June exceeded 50
per cent and, with a national referendum scheduled for September, Ukrainian
politicians are unlikely to cut spending over the summer.
The reform-minded prime minister, just back from a visit to the Baltic
republics, said Ukraine lacked the determination to implement reforms.
'Of course, there are paths to cope with this (higher energy prices) as the
Baltic republics show,' Mr Kuchma said. 'But we have many internal problems.
The key thing is for the people to have a desire to pursue reforms.'
Mr Kuchma complained, too, that the continued political struggle between
himself, the president and the parliament was paralysing the country.
He said a national state of emergency, which he lacks the political
authority to invoke, is needed to break the political deadlock and
concentrate economic decision-making in the hands of a single leader.
The prime minister also urged Ukraine to declare itself a temporary nuclear
power. He said Ukraine had no plans to control the nuclear missiles on its
territory but had to assert ownership to receive the valuable enriched
uranium contained in the warheads.

FT  09 JUL 93 / Nightclub expenses repaid by Attali
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Bank for Reconstruction and Development's audit committee has
uncovered further details of personal expenses incurred by its president, Mr
Jacques Attali, initially charged to the bank but since reimbursed.
The committee, which is close to completing an investigation into
overspending at the bank, has discovered Mr Attali repaid Pounds 20,000 in
personal expenses charged to the bank, including nightclub expenses. The
charges were incurred on his EBRD corporate credit card, issued by American
Express and repaid 10 days ago with a series of cheques.
A bank official said the nightclub expenses could have been considered
'legitimate' bank expenses since Mr Attali was entertaining bank clients,
businessmen and government officials. But Mr Attali decided to 'err on the
side of caution' and repay the expenses. Mr Attali had reimbursed personal
expenses charged to the bank in a similar way on 'many previous occasions'.
The audit committee has been told Mr Attali repaid Pounds 41,000 for four or
five flights in private jets taken at the bank's expense but for private
purposes. The repayment was received by the bank's finance department in
April, after the Financial Times highlighted overspending at the bank,
including Mr Attali's use of private jets. But the cheque was dated February
10.
The committee has also been told Mr Attali was bought four company cars in
the two years since becoming president. His current car is Renault's
top-of-the-range executive car, the Safrane. The committee has been told
that, prior to that, he was bought a Jaguar, a Citroen XM and a Renault
Espace.
But a bank official said the Renault Espace, a multi-purpose vehicle, had in
fact been bought for the bank's administration department, rather than Mr
Attali. When Mr Attali finished using the Citroen, it was transferred to Mr
Mario Sarcinelli, a vice president. Mr Miklos Nemeth, another vice
president, now uses the Jaguar. The Renault Espace is at the disposal of Mr
Bart le Blanc, the secretary general.
Mr Attali resigned two weeks ago after the FT disclosed he had been
reimbursed twice for a first-class ticket to Tokyo. Mr Attali has given
instructions for the bank to be repaid the ticket costs.
The audit committee's report, which will be finished by July 15, will
concentrate on Mr Attali's use of private jets and the Pounds 55m cost of
furnishing its City of London head office, though it is also examining other
costs.
Mr Attali was not available for comment yesterday.

FT  09 JUL 93 / EC and Ireland closer to solution on funding row

PROSPECTS for a solution to the row over the European Community's regional
aid funding rose yesterday, as Ireland appeared to be softening its demands
over its share.
According to senior European Commission officials, Dublin is signalling a
willingness to settle, raising hopes that next week the European Parliament
can endorse the aid package in time to start disbursing it next January.
But there has been considerable confusion about what share Ireland is
claiming over exactly what period.
The Ecu157bn (Pounds 120bn) aid package, to replace the 1989-93 structural
funds worth Ecu63bn, is spread over two periods: of six and seven years.
Ecu141.5bn in new structural funds - for backward and industrially stricken
regions and for training the unemployed - is for 1994-99. But the Ecu15.5bn
cohesion fund for the EC's four poorest member states - Ireland, Spain,
Portugal and Greece - was started up this year and runs to 1999, or over
seven years.
Mr Albert Reynolds, Irish prime minister, said at the Edinburgh summit last
December when the overall package was agreed that he had guarantees from the
Commission of IPounds 8bn for Ireland over seven years.
Senior Commission officials in Brussels say that Dublin this year submitted
a demand for nearly that figure, but over six years - the 1994-99 period -
and that this was rejected, leading to the Irish veto.
A senior Irish official in Brussels categorically denied this yesterday,
saying 'there was never any time when we were looking for a figure except
over seven years.'
If the seven-year formula is stuck to, Mr Reynolds' government can add in
the EC aid of IPounds 956m already committed to Ireland for this year,
although this allocation was set four years ago. That addition could get
Dublin reasonably close to its bottom line, but it is still not clear
whether it will be close enough.
One senior Commission official said that even with the addition, and on the
most generous interpretation of the weighting system for allocating the
funds earmarked for the poorest states, it was difficult to arrive at a
figure above IPounds 7.5bn.
Irish sources said Dublin was willing to see the relatively high percentage
share Ireland got out of the last programme diluted in the new package, but
probably not below IPounds 7.8bn.
Mr Jacques Delors, Commission president, is due to talk to Mr Reynolds
today.
The Lisbon government will seek Es3,500bn (Pounds 14.4bn) in structural
funds from the European Community for the period 1994 to 1999, Mr Anibal
Cavaco Silva, prime minister, has announced, writes Peter Wise in Lisbon.

FT  09 JUL 93 / Brussels scales down ambitions on mergers: Commission forced
to abandon plans to vet more cross-border takeovers

THE European Commission has been forced to scale down ambitions to vet more
cross-border takeovers in the face of strong opposition from Britain,
Germany and France.
Competition officials have abandoned their original hopes of lowering the
turnover thresholds in its 1990 merger rules, above which takeovers are
automatically examined in Brussels, for fear of upsetting member states.
Instead, the Commission may propose a further review of merger regulations,
perhaps in another two years.
In an article published in the Financial Times today, Mr Claus-Dieter
Ehlermann, who heads the Commission's competition department, defends the
performance of the merger control task force, and argues that the Commission
should try to make the best possible use of the existing merger rules.
Mr Karel Van Miert, EC competition commissioner, has yet to decide formally
whether to recommend changes to the EC's 1990 merger control rules. But he
is known to be doubtful about the value of pushing for increased Commission
powers when most member states are calling for greater 'subsidiarity' in the
Community - devolving powers to the most appropriate national or regional
authority.
The Commission has been conducting a wide-ranging review of the 1990 merger
rules, as required by the legislation. It will hold its last meeting with
national merger authorities next week, and Mr Van Miert is likely to make
recommendations to his fellow commissioners before the August summer break.
At present Brussels examines mergers involving companies with a combined
annual turnover worldwide of Ecu5bn, (Pounds 3.86bn) and combined EC
turnover of more than Ecu250m.
Other cases are referred back to member states, which also have the right to
demand jurisdiction over mergers of particular national significance.
Sir Leon Brittan, Mr Van Miert's predecessor, the European Parliament, and
EC companies have all called for a cut in the thresholds.
Such a reduction would have allowed the Commission to examine potentially
significant cases such as the Reed-Elsevier publishing merger last year, or
the ICI-BASF swap of polypropylene and acrylic glass activities, both of
which fell below the existing thresholds.
But France, Germany and the UK - all with well-established merger
authorities - have resisted any extension of Brussels' jurisdiction.
In his article, Mr Ehlermann does not argue for or against a change in the
thresholds, but he does indicate that improvements could be made to the
merger regulations without having to amend the law, a move which would
require member states' approval.
In particular, he urges greater transparency in procedures and working
methods.
The merger task force has been generally praised for its efficiency since
its establishment in September 1990.
It has only blocked one merger - the controversial Franco-Italian takeover
of de Havilland, the Canadian aircraft maker in 1991 - but has imposed
conditions on a number of takeovers, including the Nestle bid for Perrier
last year. Cutting the thresholds would have increased the number of cases
automatically examined each year from 60 to 100, officials have estimated.
